{"text":"This place is just getting better, and better. Do not be mistaken-- this is a brewery/restaurant where their number one concern is the Ales they produce... and they do a bang-up job churning new one's out all the time.  We love dropping by and sampling new beers on tap by getting a flight which is a sampling of 5 beers.    What we've really noticed over the past year is the quality of food coming out of the kitchen now.  Their sandwiches and BBQ are really good.  We weren't too hot on the grub when Indie first opened, but we really dig it now!  Only small gripe is that they charge for their popcorn, and charge a lot for it.  Also, I wish that they'd have a large pretzel on their menu, which would be great to have with a beer.   The place is still developing, the retail store seems to have new stuff added every week.  A little bit pricier than I wish, but this is really a must-go-to place when in Junction."}
{"text":"Cool place in the Junction neighborhood especially if you like craft beer! They always have something new to try and if you don't know what to pick...choose a tasting flight!"}
{"text":"I'm not a crazy beer person, but been there a few times, I love their option of being able to buy a whole glass jug to go and come back for refills. What caught my tongue was their Angry Hawaiian pizza, it was REALLY angry (spicy) but REALLY good. Going back for another pizza soon."}
{"text":"Went to Indie Ale. house for a Sunday din din and love it our server Skyler was quite helpful with the beer selection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer. Some of the beers here tasted quite good. I liked the Rainmaker (stout). Food not so tasty but it looks good. Service is good and they are quite friendly. Stick with the beers and go somewhere else for food, coffee etc. Prices are reasonable. Some beers a little pricey for the amount you get. Look at the posted size before you buy."}
{"text":"Wow the beers are amazing my favorite is Red Tape Stout. I'm not going to tell how good is this beer, just try. Also breakfast Porter is out of this world don't forget to order the hummus, Olive's & flathead. You will ask why I didn't gave the 5 starts well I think service could be more open and try to engage the guest. But all is good. Amazing time"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day. The Southern Fried Chicken is really, really REALLY good. Seriously, if you like fried chicken, I insist that you try it. The beer is obviously great too. Lots of cool beers to choose from.   The beer \"take out\" section is open late (I think until 11pm Mon-Sat and 9pm on Sun) so add it to your list of places to get booze after the Beer Store/LCBO closes."}
{"text":"I have been to the Indie Alehouse at least five times now and my experiences have ranged from Good to Pretty Sad.   My most recent visit on Saturday Dec 1st was pretty sad. My family was visiting and my Brother in Law doesn't get out much so he was itching to go here to try their beer.  When we arrived there was no wait for a table and even after we were seated there was still empty seats.The beer was great, my BIL and I had the Instigator, my favourite.  I have tried them all and my Husband had the Breakfast Porter. The kids and my SIL had sodas.   I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend going here with children. The wait time is very long and they only have 2 high chairs for what is a very large space in a \"family neighbourhood\".  I was offered a high chair by the table beside me who had finished with it and another female patron flew up to me and proceeded to be quite rude to me as if I was stealing it away. Apparently \"some people\" (as she said) had been waiting 45 minutes for a high chair. I let her take the chair.  Due to the time of day they were serving a limited Brunch Menu that consisted of Goat Cheese Salad, Fires, Samosas, Pulled Pork Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Mac n Cheese, Pulled Pork Sandwich, or a Burger.We placed our food order when the server came to take our drink order.  Our drinks came quickly. Our food however did not. We waited an HOUR.   AN HOUR! Seriously????? Not apologetic, no explanation, NOTHING. Brutal.  We were seated near the kitchen, I was able to see how many orders were in...there were only 10 however when you are turning out such a limited menu this is truly unacceptable.  When the food FINALLY came, everyone's was fine except mine. How do I know? I tried everyone's and I had tried what I ordered before as well which was the Mushroom Mac n Cheese. It was barely warm, barely sauced and the pasta was way under cooked. I took one bite and returned it.  I didn't bother ordering anything else because by the time the server returned to check how everything was my party was halfway through their meals.  What I can say is that on other occasions when I have been to Indie, the beer is awesome, the pizza's and wings delicious but the service is not great. Seems like they've got quite a few nubes in there.   I'm sure I will return to Indie in the future but it will only be for the beer.  The service has a long way to go....."}
{"text":"I was planning a party for 16 people and called to ask for a reso and was told I would be contacted by a manager and when I followed up because I didn't hear back for 2 days the worker on the phone said 'impossible. Absolutely impossible'.  I thought it was very unprofessional to say that and it would've been nice to be told that it would be difficult when I initially called 2 days prior.  it unfortunate since I live in the Junction and thought this would be a cool place to go to from time to time but not anymore."}
{"text":"Visited the Indie Ale House last Thursday, not my first visit, but thought I would write my review on it.  On a day off headed there for lunch with my wife, we love craft beer.  Started with some popcorn, which is awesome, grana padano and bacon added.  I started with a taster flight, I enjoy many of their beers, Instigator IPA, Breakfast porter, etc....tasty as always.  They had a great guest tap of GLB Lake Effect IPA and Sawdusty City collab 11.05.  For lunch we had the pulled pork sandwich special.  Very well done, sauce had a nice spice bite and the meat was cooked nicely.  Really enjoyed it.  Fries were cooked nicely as well.  Service was really good, as it usually is.  We grabbed some beer at the store on the way out for later.  Another great visit to the Indie Ale House, will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great spot for a delicious craft beer and even some good eats. I mean popcorn with bacon? How can you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"Great place with a great vibe.  Food was delicious.  Can get pretty loud in the place on a Saturday night, but everyone is having such a great time!  I would go back in a heartbeat...."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, ok for dinner. Limited menu, options are slim, service is good, overall. I wish they would add more items to the menu, you get tired of the food fast after a few nights out.  BUT. the beer is great. Awesome place to have a few beers and a pizza or salad. I regularly host lunch meetings with out of town clients and they all love the beer options."}
{"text":"Great beer - get a flight of 5 so you can sample a whole bunch. Food is a little hit or miss, but the beer more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the Junction and were eagerly awaiting the opening of the Indie Ale House. We went Friday night after work and had a flight of  5 of the independent microbrewery's ales from the left side of the board.To eat my wife had the mac and cheese with mushrooms and I had the burger. We shared bites - the mac and cheese was spectacular, and while the burger was good it fell a bit flat in taste (needed some zing - for my money a Rowe's premium lamb burger BBQ'd with fixings and the Fred's bread bun is the best in the city (but you BBQ it yourself ;) ). The beer was excellent and featured a wide range of beer styles and flavours (stouts, ales, IPAs etc.). Our favorite was the Broken Hipster. It was good enough to go again Saturday night and try more.  I'd like to see more inventiveness in the the burger that we saw the next day in pizzas. Consider different meats and blends and layer in more flavor. You can make a killer pizza sauce clearly - so a killer burger sauce/flavouring should not be impossible.   Saturday we returned for dinner and had a flight from the right side of the board - which included the interesting and super-fruity raspberry infused Spadina, and a very Coffee-and-chocolate tasting stout. Yummy. What blew our minds was the pizza - we are big thin crust fans and have had pizza from Vesuvios countless times and have had from Buddah Pie (when they were delivering). I was not expecting to get served pizza we now consider to be better than both Vesuvios and Buddah Pie. I had the Three (sorry can't recall the name exactly) Pigs pizza (three kinds of pork) and my wife had the Junction Pie. Both pizzas blew our minds - unbelievably good. The crusts were thin and crunchy as they should be (not thin and oily) the flavours were incredible. The sauce on the Three Pigs pizza was amazing. Both pizzas were top notch. We ended up with leftovers and it was just as excellent cold the next day.  Service was excellent, the atmosphere great, the serving staff knew the food and beers and could make recommendations.  I would highly recommend the Indie Ale House without hesitation to family and friends. Please keep up the great work - and please - 1) work on the burger; and 2) introduce take out! The mac and cheese and pizzas we tried -  I can vouch for as outstanding.   We will be back! (With friends!)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food and beer. We were in town for the weekend and we ended up eating there twice because it was so good! Y'all should open a location in Columbus, Ohio!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I'm afraid that I may considered a regular soon.  I always mean to write a review, but never get around to it because the experience is always so good, I opt to chill and let the great food and awesome beer sit in my belly!   Typically, I order either the Southern Fried chicken with kale salad or the wild  mushroom nd kale pizza.  Trust me, either of these is a hit!  The Southern Fried chicken is boneless and is perfectly battered. It's not oily by any means and is served with a ranch and honey honey jot mustard sauce. Separately or together, they're awesome with the chicken! The wild mushroom and kale pizza is outta this world!  Sure, it sounds weird, but the soft, wonderfully baked mushrooms paired with the light and crispy kale is a treat for the taste buds!    I've only had the wit'ner beers on their menu and have actually taken a few bottles home!  Since they're a brewery, you can purchase a bottle or a a kick as jug of a select few of their brews. I'm not going to go into their beers ... I would rather diners experience a pint or sample a flight for themselves!  You definitely won't regret it especially if you let your server guide you based on your food selection ... so give them an idea of what you're thinking of ordering! Oh and tip them well! I haven't met a staff member I haven't liked!"}
{"text":"Two of us had a couple of apps and a pizza that were delicious.  The craft beers that are brewed on site...AWESOME.. Looking forward to my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Delicious food and great beer - although the beer is better for people who have a bit of a sophisticated palette. Our server was excellent."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Really good burger here yesterday. The duck pizza was okay as well but needs more complexity. We also tried a beer flight, a couple were good like zombie and conspiracy. Worth checking out for the burger is big and melts in mouth."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place in the West End ...so glad we got this reco!  Not only do the beer flights offer great variety, the food is FAB!  The vibe of the restaurant is warm and friendly, and so was the service.    We had the Quinoa salad, which was beautifully presented, the tiny tuna tacos (so crispy and delicious), and the Kale and Mushroom with truffle oil and goat cheese was amazing.  There were so many other items I'd like to try next time I'm back.  Dessert(Strawberry Mess, Broken Dollie) was just OK, not as special as the rest of the items we tried.  Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient - she mentioned that the chef at Indie formerly worked at Canoe.  We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Thursday night, and it was easy to get a table (no resos), however, by7:30 the place was packed."}

{"text":"Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger. Get the Burger.   There is a Burger trend in Toronto right now, and this place is quietly leading the way. Sweet Jesus!  It is hard to get a normal tasting beer here, but that I guess is my issue. I don't like all the hoppy and extra wheat micro brews. If you do, this place has a great election to choose from. I wish they just carried steam whistle or something normal and local.   All the food that came out of the kitchen looked top notch. I'll be back as often as I can being from Niagara."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. Weird mix of a young crowd and people on dates vs. families.   The food and beer here is excellent. Can't go wrong with lamb burger and Instigator beer--which is one of my favourite beers in general.   Great part is that they have a separate section where you can purchase their beer to go. Feels like all the energy in The Junction starts here."}
{"text":"When this place first opened we loved the beer but not the food, then about a year ago the kitchen changed and our rating went from three to five stars.  We've been there many times and it is always consistent with food and service.  The beer is absolutely fantastic and there is something for everyone and more. It is one of a few places that we return to regularly and we're not the only ones.  The place is often full and it is easy to understand why."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food, and of course the beer keep me coming back to Indie Ale house regularly. I live in the neighbourghood and look forward to when a friend suggests coming to dinner in the area because I always take people here!  Make sure to go early on a weekend, the restaurant does get busy, but it's always work the wait.  I haven't tried the growlers yet, but plan to now that the summer is underway!  Thanks for bringing such a great business to the Junction area."}
{"text":"This place was packed around 9:30 on a Friday night, but I wasn't impressed and probably won't be back.  I understand it's a brewery, but I was expecting them to have some more adult drink offerings than just beer and a disgusting Chardonnay.  The men ordered 2 samplers with all 10 beers and didn't really enjoy any of them. The girls ordered the only white wine offered, and one wine spritzer...with no ice because this place doesn't even have ice.  If you're a beer drinker, you'll probably enjoy this place. But if you have a group that wants more variety of drinks try a different bar in the junction."}
{"text":"Really good food, but some is really heavy, and the lobster rolls have a small quantity and is not good, but the drink selection is amazing some of the best drinks I ever had was their. I recommend this place to you and hope you enjoy it."}
{"text":"Definitely get a flight! The selection is amazing and the beers are all great, even if they are not all to everyone's taste. The staff also take the time to explain everything that went into the beer so you aren't left guessing about why you like one over another. It has been a great addition to the neighbourhood. The popcorn is also a must-have!"}
{"text":"First off, I am a homebrewer.  Second off, beer selection in Canada sucks.  So, when we found a real live, honest to goodness brewhouse in Canadia, I was overjoyed.    Indie's was great.  We arrived on a Thursday night about 7:30 and chose to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. (wife and myself).  Homerun.  The barmaid was very helpful and knowledgeable about the beers they brew there.  My wife ordered a flight of beers and the barmaid remembered exactly which each one was after Jenn was over halfway through the flight.  The other staff was really helpful too - knowledgeable about  beers as well as the local goings on.  They were busy and service was a little on the slow side but not annoyingly so.  As I said, the other servers were very happy to help out.    So as for beer quality, I give them an A.  I ordered two different pints rather than a flite and each was very nice.  I sampled each of my wife's flight glasses and could tell that IAH knew what they were doing.  Kudos.  If you are a connoisseur of beer you will not be disappointed here.    We ordered the Angry Hawaiian Pizza.  It was delish.  The Habanero pesto is on the hot side but not too hot for me.  I like hot stuff but can handle like mid-level hot at Thai places.  Anyway that 'za was great.  If you like Hawaiian type pizza and a little heat - go for it."}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. Food was delicious! I had the short rib burger and shared the spicy wings with my husband and both delivered an impeccable meal! I still can't stop thinking about my juicy burger! The atmosphere was great but I must add that our waitress was a bit of a tool. Fortunately that definitely wouldn't stop me from going back. Good job IAH!"}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for better food, service or beer.  I was in town for 3 nights and ate here two of those nights.  The popcorn is out of this world, actually tried all three flavors!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a huge favour and try the Indie Burger. Seriously. Just do it.  They have a variety of different craft beers which are all brewed on site and have super fun names. Picking one can be a little hard, in which case you can always order a flight, which is five different beers of your choice in little glasses, served on a cute wooden board.  They also have a shop at the front of the store, where you can purchase a 16 oz. growler of whichever beer(s) they are selling that day for $25 AND you get $5 off if you bring in an empty growler when you purchase.  The decor is warm and trendy, but by no means pretentious. There always seems to be a fun mix of people ranging from neighbourhood hipsters to sweet elderly couples having animated conversations.  It does get VERY busy and crowded during the weekends, so maybe come during the week or earlier in the day if that's not your thing."}
{"text":"Only go for the beer, the porters and stouts are good. The food is another story, just terrible. Tried the macaroni and cheese with brisket last Friday and was served a soupy and unflavourful bowl of disappointment. And it wasn't brisket?! It tasted like cold slices of pork chop, certainly wasn't pulled, hadn't been warmed through and was covered in a foul BBQ sauce. Was the worst."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy drinking to get get drunk?  Me too.  The Indie Ale House allows me to do the above, and feel \"hip\" and \"in\" whilst doing so.  The interior design and wall art are very well done and bla, bla, bla...  Let's get to the beer.   I sat my ass down and couldn't decide which beer to try.  (See ladies, dude's can be indecisive too.)  Luckily for us, they offer a flight of 5 different beers in mini glasses.  Just like the kind a toddler would drink beer out of!  I got two flights and tried every beer on the menu.  Suddenly the heavily tattooed waitress with the aggressive piercings and drastic hair style, started to look pretty good!  The beer there is amazing.  If it's not made on the premises, it's from another micro brewery nearby.  I blame the Indie Ale House for my new found affinity for Craft Beer.  (To my AA sponsor's chagrin.)  The food there is great too.  Being a remorseless eating machine, I've tried a lot of what's on the menu.  Smoked Wings, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Butternut Squash Samosas, the Meat and Cheese Board, and lets not forget the pizzas!  It's all good!  And if you find you have eaten too much, just have a couple of more drinks and it'll all come back out again!  Ladies, be sure to ask a friend to hold your hair back.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the staff.  They are kind, and helpful and all of that.  They also ALL thought sleeving their arms with tattoos would be a wise thing to do.  (Justin Bieber has the same tattoos, so...)  When I see EVERYBODY in a bar with their arms sleeved, then that means NOBODY has their arms sleeved.  It's just normal now.  I myself not having any tattoos, am now the bizarre rebel who scoffs at conformity.  That being said, if you are not a curmudgeon who over thinks everything and gives his wife an earful of his theories for days after, you should go to the Indie Ale House and enjoy yourself!  It's great and I can't wait to go back!  @thesideburnguys"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to write this review as I'm nervous it will just get busier with more positive feedback, but they deserve the kudos. I get the eggplant parm sandwich every time because I am (mostly) veggie and it's unreal. The popcorn appetizer is terrific. Hubby has never been disappointed with any of their meat sandwiches, maybe especially the fried chicken sandwiches. Heaven! The beers are obviously a highlight. I'm a big fan of Instigator.  A chill junction-y vibe, they are accepting of families and non-families alike. Staff are super friendly. Just a top-notch neighbourhood joint with very delicious food and extremely satisfying beer. Two thumbs way up - it will continue to be a go-to for me!"}
{"text":"100 % amazeballs. Had lunch with my mom, and we were both amazed at the amazingness. I had the lamb burger - which was super tall and contained GOAT CHEESE, HOLY YUM, and which almost literally melted my face with joy. Mom had the open-faced brisket sandwich and was equally moved, though more maturely so (slightly). We both had a \"Time to Shine\" beer, which was magical beyond wizardry.  I'm pretty much reliving this experience right now and it's STILL GREAT. Go. Eat. Explode."}
{"text":"Great food and great craft beer selection. Best fried chicken ever! Waiters are very knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"Nice local brewery, but on the $$$ steep side but enjoyable place in the heart of the junction."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. Amazing burgers and fried chicken. The selection of beer never disappoints either."}
{"text":"The atmosphere: Nice, smart casual atmosphere. Looks great on the inside, surprising amount of space.  Beer: great selection, we like to try everything so the availability of beer flights are a big plus. You can choose your own flight of 5, which let's you try almost the full menu.  select brews are available for purchase at the store. They take their own bottles back for more than you'd get at the beer store.   Food: Menu is great. The rib Appetizer is spectacular. The bison burger is very heavy. Another of meat, light on the toppings. Not a fan of the fries. Mini deserts are also recommended.   Great place overall. A little out of the way but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and I have to say the beers are generally very unique (with some that taste completely generic). We each ordered a flight of 5 different beers, such that we got to taste most of the beers on offer (10 of the 12 or so). Our server did an outstanding job of explaining the flavour profile of each glass. She also cautioned us that some beers were love it or hate it situations. And she was absolutely right on that point. I would recommend to try a flight if it's your first time coming, or if you're returning after a long break, since their offerings change regularly (they have 4 permanent options and 6+ rotating ones as far as I can tell). If you like beer, you're guaranteed to find at least one option you like. Personally I'm not a beer fanatic but I LOVED the Zombie Apocalypse which tasted like coffee and chocolate somehow. The other 9 varied (for my taste) between reasonably good and horrible, but that's okay. That's bound to happen at a place that has unconventional brews, and that's the reason for ordering a flight. Overall, I'm impressed with their beer, mainly by the fact you cannot find anything similar to many of them anywhere else.  The food was pretty good. I ordered the charcuterie board which was fantastic: a generous helping of meats, flatbread, pate and mustard. I wish they'd given some more olives, but that's a minor complaint. My friend ordered the black truffle popcorn which, while delicious, was simply too rich to eat more than half of, even with both of us chipping away at it.   The space, as other reviews have mentioned, is large and aesthetically pleasing, with dark woods offset by mellow lighting. There's definitely a great ambiance to the place. It's got a spirit as unique as its beer. The seating is a mix of separate and communal (long) tables though, which I'm not a fan of. I prefer a little bit of privacy, and while we were lucky to be seated at a communal table with no one beside us I could see how cramped it got at other tables that were full, once food and drink were brought.   Service was excellent, but getting and paying the bill took a very long time. Pricing was fair.   I'm glad I tried this place, and will return. It gets 4.5 stars instead of 5 because while it was on the whole very good, the seating situation made it just shy of perfect for me. And Yelp, please let reviewers pick half stars!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ive been waiting for it to open for a while now, and the beers are purely amazing! Definitely a place to check out if you are into microbrewery ales. The food is also really good, try the Angry Hawaiian pizza if you are adventurous enough. Great location and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. Love the beer, love the food. I always get the same thing although I have tried other options. I usually get the fried chicken but sometimes I've found that the coating can be burnt. Loved when they use to put some arugula in with the potato salad but they don't do that anymore. Service is always on spot even when it's really busy. Favourite beer is the cockpuncher and I always recommend it to people."}
{"text":"Disappointing and surprising service. We are regulars who live in the Junction and went recently when my wife was pregnant.  She asked for a soda water and lime as she couldn't drink alcohol.  Our server told us they were an ale house and didn't do \"mixed drinks.\"  The server then said we could order a soda water and a juice separately to mix ourselves but we'd have to buy two drinks.  They told us the owner wants a true \"ale house\" (?) and doesn't accommodate.   We haven't been back since - you have a large customer base who have small children and/or are pregnant, or others who cannot drink and just want a reasonable non-alcoholic option.  Your own employees admitted they were mortified by this - get off your high horse."}
{"text":"I remember going to Indie when they first opened a couple years ago. It was a cool vibe, food was really good. Been back lately and it has not kept up the quality. The cool bar is not fully a family style restaurant. The food is mediocre at best. Sad to see a cool place lose itself like that"}
{"text":"We lived in the Junction for a year, home of little shops and deco stores and apparently some of the best restaurants in the city. And yet, the one place that we kept going back to was this pub. We came back almost on a weekly basis, because that's how good it was.  Now the funny thing is, I don't drink beer. So I didn't come here for the brewery, even though it's what they're known for. I came here for the food. The food!  I've had almost every vegetarian/pescetarian item on the menu, and let me tell you, everything was delicious. No exception. Their salmon sandwiches and salmon pizza are to die for. Their quinoa salad is so amazing I've been trying to recreate it at home without getting the flavors right. Their desserts are so great too, and I've tried all of them. Yup.  The service has always been great. Sometimes a bit slow to get the bill, but at least they don't rush you out (even though there's (almost) always a line of people wanting to get a table). The little booths are comfy.   Conclusion: now that I've moved, the place I miss the most from the Junction is Indie Ale House. Who would have thought."}
{"text":"New Ale House Opened September in Junction. I'd seen the place transforming over the last couple of months and went by Saturday for a bite.   The place is packed. I must have arrived at THE perfect time since i got a table right away then instant line-up out the door.   Big.. no, HUGE seating area. Runs in many directions, good sized bar, with lots of ALES.... (don't ask for a lager).   They brew everything on-site. Had to go for the 5 selection flight as I wanted to have a few tastes and still be able to make it home in one piece.   The beers are good. And I like beer.   For eats, we started with some deep fried mozzarella with a dipping sauce, yum. Followed by the Arugula Pizza & Three Little Pigs pizza to split. Wow!  Now I consider myself something of a pizza connoisseur, and it was delicious. So much so gluttony became evident as i couldn't even pack it up as i had to have it.   Great Spot. I'll re-visit.   My only beef about the place is that they pack too many tables in. It's a big place people, you've got lots of space. I'd like mine too. Not peoples asses hitting my elbow trying to squeeze in and out between tables. Not to mention I almost took out a good three people simply trying to slide into my jacket. (no, it's not a Canada Goose)"}
{"text":"Saturday midday lunch. Busy! Great service clean table servers very friendly and relaxed although place was packed. No apps but beers delicious and entrees outstanding. Dessert size appropriate and very tasty. Definitely a must return spot. Nice weather the front windows/seating open to the sidewalk cafe style."}
{"text":"Great beer. Good food. Excellent service. Go there now...or whenever it next opens..."}
{"text":"Soooo.... I was craving fried chicken on a Sunday morning but woke up too late to check out Stockyards on St Clair which closed early (imo) at 2:30pm. I didn't feel like driving toooo far so I looked up fried chicken places near me in the Junction area. I've been to other brunch places in the area but had no clue what to expect from an ale house... at first I was hesitant since I didn't really feel like drinking more, especially on a Sunday morning on a thanksgiving weekend lol.   I looked up pictures on yelp and the chicken looked good. Wasn't chicken and waffles but I was good for anything at that point of time. Boy.... was I in for a treat!!   First of all, since it was Thanksgiving weekend, they were serving a turkey dinner. But this was no regular turkey we're talking about here. It was two huge pieces of Fried Turkey Breast in their regular fried chicken batter w a ton of fancy sides (sorry I forgot , but there was bacon in there somewhere). The server was super nice and said it was the best thing he ever ate. If I didn't have turkey at family dinners over the weekend, I would have ordered that dish for two. Sadly, I didn't want to sleep all day from an itis coma, so I looked at the other options.   Second, to our surprise, this ale house not only makes ale but they also made their own sodas in a wide variety of flavours including but not limited to cola, cherry cola, ginger ale, cream soda, etc. Friend went w cherry cola. Holy geez, this was the best cherry cola that I've ever tasted. To be fair, I'm not a huge cherry cola fan, but it was so so so refreshing, light and not overly fizzy that I might have become a fan of that one brand of cherry cola. With that said, next time I'll definitely try their cream soda. For me, I had a couple of americanos. One downside is that they don't serve refillable drip coffee...but americano was okay.   Third, let's talk about the real meal deal. They don't have a specific brunch menu. So just full sized portions. Ordered two fried chicken dishes. One original and one Nashville Hot!! One thing I liked about their version of fried chicken was that it was Boneless!! Nice and Crispy on the outside and oh so so soft and succulent on the inside. Simply put, it was Deliciousss. Must dip in the mustard sauce! The Nashville hot version was drenched in chili spicy oil so it definitely left a lingering spice. Dipping the spicy one in the ranch sauce kind of helped. If you are like me and like just a little bit of spice, then go w the original because the original also has a bit of chilli flakes on the fried chicken too but not as super spicy as the other version. I really liked indie pale ale houses version of fried chicken! Definitely hit the spot!! Also on a side note, it came w a delicious potato salad.   Overall, good service. Great food. Will definitely come back again to try other items on their menu!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ventured into the Junction a couple of years back, I had my eyes on a few other places that I wanted to try out and saw the Indie Alehouse but didn't think it was for me.  This was my second visit in a month and a half, and I have to say I was really glad to have tried it out.  The food here is AWESOME and different.  Over course of my two visits I have tried and shared a number of items on the menu with only one repeat....the fried chicken, a definite weakness of mine from time to time.  Here it is served boneless, with light and dark meat and a trio of sauces should you so desire. As with all dishes I have seen and tried, the servings here are large and both times I gave taken food home.  In terms if starters, the different varieties of gourmet popcorn are great for sharing, and of course work well with the many in-house brews. I have tried both the black truffle butter flavour and the white cheddar and rosemary flavour.  Delish!  Other winners include the lobster roll and the house made pizzas.  Over the course of my two visits I have tried 3 of the in house brews, the Broken Hipster (wheat beer), the Punch Buggy (raspberry ale) and the Rabbit of Caerbannog (white IPA).  The Broken Hipster is the go-to....but the Punch Buggy was different and very good.  Looking forward to going back, and will take more pics next time!"}
{"text":"Ok so last time I went they nailed all the dishes-except maybe that weird parmigiano-sour chicken wing dish- not a fan but I was very impressed especially since the last two visits food was uneventful- I think they got new kitchen crew so that's a good thing now"}
{"text":"This may be my favourite craft brewery in the city. The beers are outstanding and the food has never disappointed. I really like sour beers and so always get whatever version of spading monkey they are offering though I've really not had a beer I've disliked.  The polenta is one of my favourite things on the menu. You. Must. Try. It. Seriously amazing."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night, great atmosphere, servers were knowledgable in the beers that were on tap and the food was great. Nice to have a good micro brew in the neibourhood. That's my new place to take friends and its kid friendly."}
{"text":"This brewpub is my favourite! The space, food, beer top marks! While I'm not a big beer drinker there's a great selection of beer on tap to try (10-15 on rotation). The $13 beer flight with 5 samplers was the way to go.  Food on the other hand blew me away! Yes it's bar food but I would call this elevated. We ordered food for the table to share.  Fried Chicken- juicy and crispy served with both a sweet and savoury dip and a side of mac & cheese- Get this! Flat bread- served warm with mixed olives and hummus  Mixed crowd mostly people in their mid 20-30's and a couple young families earlier in the night.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how unfriendly the server was on BOTH occasions  (different server.) Do they coach their employees to make snarky comments and roll their eyes at questions about beer?   the beer was okay though, so there's that."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the variety of the beers offered and enjoyed most of the ones I sampled. The food was good as well. I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"The tables here are tight and intimate, but in a very efficient yet cozy way. I think I enjoyed the names of the beer more than the beer themselves, but it lends to the experience. The most interesting would be the Cockpuncher, an imperial IPA (11% ABV.) I was surprised because normally I don't like IPAs but this was interesting. Broken Hipster, a Belgian Wit (4.5% ABV), is a great 'table beer', one you could keep on ordering. Light, refreshing, and easy to drink. At the time I went, they had the Wit'ner Toque \"winter wit\" (5% ABV) which is definitely best suited with the Mac and Cheese I had. By the way, the Mac and Cheese was delightful. I licked the bowl clean. Shrimp Tacos were also good. But then again, I was so hungry, they could've given me taco shells and I'd be happy. Service was attentive and I did not feel rushed to leave even though it was so packed. Overall, I'd return just for the beer names. Cocktails shouldn't have all the fun."}
{"text":"Great beer - I like that they make it themselves. We liked the \"Ralph's Nuts\".  The food was decent. However - small portions for the price! $15 mac and cheese in a mini-ramekin just doesn't cut it for me, even if it has a sliver or two of brisket inside.   And it was packed with only 2 waitresses working, which makes for a slow service.   If I'm back, I'm back for beer, and maybe I'll try their $5 popcorn. I wonder if that comes in a mini ramekin, too."}
{"text":"Exceptional brewers, better than average ales rivaling those of Bellwoods, excellent barbecue night on I think Thursdays.  Also had some less than amazing food there, the pizzas and the burgers arel expensive but so-so. Perhaps they have made some improvements but I stayed away from some menu items."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here.  The beers were great and interesting as well.  The food was very good.  Highly recommend the ribs."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night for a group of 7 and the service was absolutely terrible. The server pointed to the board multiple times instead of explaining what the beers were, he was incredibly rude and definitely shouldn't be working in customer service.  Honestly over all, the service, food and beer is absolutely nothing special. Definitely not as special as they think they are.... Just pick somewhere else. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Their beer, which is brewed on site, is great and their food is fantastic! I had the spicy pizza and would gladly have it again. Definitely try the popcorn as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent beers. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose.  Service was great.  One star off for mediocre food -- I had the pizza which was a bit under cooked and a bit weird flavours (pickled onion and anchovy with goat cheese)  Overall I would definitely return, but would pick a different main to eat."}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed, young and accessible. The Indie Ale House was a great experience. Though a little crowded, the service was good. We waited about 20 minutes for our appetizer. The waitress apologized and said it was due to the dinner rush. The beer selection is extensive. I'm not a huge fan of ale beer but I enjoyed a few samples. For my entree, I had the Southern Fried Chicken. I was definitely not disappointed with my choice. It was delicious.   I intend to visit the Indie Ale House again."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had a spiced wheat beer and pizza with smoked salmon. Everything was delicious, and the staff was very friendly. I only wish that they took reservations! The two of us had to sit at the bar, and it was only 6pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"Not sure what could make it better! It's not 5* dining, but for a gastropub it is one of my faves. Craft beer made on-site (try a flight to sample) and the food is top notch pub grub for people who like flavour!  Bison & Pork Belly burger was outrageously good and other items looked great.  Wish it were closer to my house!  I'd be there all the time..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Junction. If u like hoppie beer you're gonna love their crafted beer. Amazing and friendly service."}
{"text":"5-5-5-5. All around great bar. Incredible beer selection and so much fun to try. The beers are always rotating at all times so what you have today won't be the same as what you have next time. You can take beer with you, and craft beer, at that....so, mega plus. Now besides that AWESOME factor, there's the food. The food is amazing. So delicious! My boyfriends burger was larger than my head and we literally just stared at it for a minute before we both decided maybe a fork and knife would be best to start with. It was crazy delicious besides the mess and he says totally worth it. I had a nice, neat sandwich that was definitely delicious and I would probably order it again, and will definitely be back soon! Wooohoooooo!"}
{"text":"Good beer and Good food. We tried few of their beer; Winter Toque, Broken Hipster, Breakfast Porter, Ritual Madness, Grendel's Revenge, Jackpot and we liked them all. We ween't in the mood for supper so just tried their cheese board, truffled fries and cheddar, garlic butter and rosemary pop-corns. Everything was nicely done. The service was great too. Will definitely visit again next time I find myself in Junction."}
{"text":"This is strictly about the food, cause I don't drink beer.  The first time I went, I had the banana bread french toast, which was yummy if a bit too rich.  This time I had the beef brisket mac and cheese. It tasted fine, but the cheese part of the equation kind of gets lost in there. Not sure if brisket and mac and cheese are meant to be together. The bread that came with it wasn't very interesting.  Service was fast, friendly, and unfussy."}
{"text":"Great beer, even better pizza! My friend took me here for my last night out in Toronto. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the beers and made some good suggestions - I ended up with the porter, which I loved. We shared the Angry Hawaiian pizza which featured habanero pesto and was awesome! I could have eaten 3 of these!  Otherwise, the restaurant was fun, laid back and really enjoyable. I wish I could go back (easily). I was eyeing pizzas at other tables which looked equally delicious."}
{"text":"lots of beer to choose from with amazing servers! Their food is pretty good too. I wouldn't go there for dinner as there isn't much to choose from, but definitely go for drinks. i went with a group of 10 people and the staff were great; friendly and attentive. served us quickly and came back frequently seeing if we needed anything else. definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Quite simply, if you like beer and good food, this is the place for you.  Sure they don't take reservations and we had to wait for a while (party of 6), but when our meals came out, no one was disappointed. In fact, I was pretty blown away with the vegetarian sandwich I ordered. There weren't too many veggie options but \"The Aubergine\" was incredible. Two breaded and fried slices of eggplant topped with melted mozzarella, tomatoes, kale, and sauce between a heavenly bun. Each bite was a real mouthful bursting with flavour.  I ordered a flight of beers as well to sample as many varieties as I could. It seemed like a good deal and I had a fun time taste testing the drinks.  Overall the prices are a bit on the higher end, but the food quality is equally high! I would definitely come back again, and next time I'll be trying a pizza!"}
{"text":"Highlight of our Family Day!  Normally the Indie Ale House doesn't open until 5pm, but on a whim, we pulled up at noon, and to our great surprise they were just opening!   No trip to the Indie Ale House is complete without trying some of their beers on tap. To start, we tried their Love Triangle IPA, and ordered their Indie Burger x 2.   While we were sipping on our delicious beers, all we could see coming from the kitchen was burger after burger. The service was very attentive, even considering it started to get busy very soon after we were seated.   Our burgers arrived in great time, and we dug in. Oh my, the Indie Burgers did not disappoint! I am not a burger person normally, but I highly recommend getting this burger! I got mine with the salad, and my hubby got the fries. Wow, the fries were amazing, and I honestly have to say that the kale salad with toasted quinoa was tasty!   If you are a hophead, I strongly recommend the Instigator. We even got adventurous and tried the Nicklebrook Old Kentucky Bastard, which was a bourbon barrel aged strong beer. Holy macaroni! Not for the faint of heart, but a treat as a dessert finisher.   The place was packed when we left at 2pm, but we did manage to take home a couple of bottles of their Instigator IPA for home.   Worth the trip to the Junction, for sure :)  Thanks Indie Ale House, for another great visit!"}
{"text":"The beer and atmosphere is great!  Love this addition to the neighbourhood.  I do feel that the Growlers are not competitively priced in their retail.  If they were closer to other micro's growler prices I would definitely change my review to 4 stars.  EDIT - Changing my vote to 4 stars because they do have amazing beer and their owner loves to fight for the rights of Ontario beer fans."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, little pricy but it was totally worth it.  Food selections and beers seem to match well. Service was great too. Very welcoming atmosphere, and I will go back definitely."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how good the food is at this place...In less than 1 month ive been there three times... I LOVE IT. I had their fried chicken (spicy) mushroom mac and cheese and tuna tacos. The portions are really good.  Their sauces are amazing...and dont forget to ask them for the spicy one if you love some pepper sauce! Take some home, you can have it with all your other meals, i would actually pay for that sauce though!  It's house made I believe? I'm pretty sure it is because theres nothing else like it... The service is great.  As far as I know they do change their beer menu throughout the day.(which is written on a cute wooden thing on the wall (I cannot comment on the beer because I did not try it) Parking might be a bit of an issue if you are going at a busy time.  The atmosphere/vibe is very welcoming and it's a really chill place to bring your date for a casual night out or just hanging out with friends I would go here again and again...  The servers are very detailed and informative about the menu, which should be the case but sometimes you end up at places and they are not helpful...but thats not the case. It is one of those places where you would want to go back and try different items.   On the side note, if you like to mix food items together... I would say take some mac and cheese, put fried chicken on top add some pepper sauce and take a bite...it is SO good... and if that sounds gross to you then just have it invidiually...each item has its own taste and story. ;)  Oh and also don't forget to check out the small shop they have inside the restaurant but right when you enter (YOU CANT MISS IT)"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and an amazing kale salad. You can grab a beer flight to try what they have on tap and (Clint says) they have one of the best burgers in the Junction."}
{"text":"One of my favourite burger places. Their burgers are spectacular. The desserts are small but amazing.  They also brew their own beer. A little too hoppy for my liking, but have some good ones. The broken hipster - my go to beer there, or wine."}
{"text":"Cockpuncher....cool name and an awesome IIPA.  Just can't get enough lol...  Fried chicken was amazing too, portion was a lot bigger than I thought it was because it's BONELESS!!!  Awesome food, awesome beers, awesome vibe, great job!!!"}
{"text":"Not really a beer drinker but I did enjoy the Blood Orange imperial wit. Had the popcorn of the day which was awesome but a bit greasy. Very cool bar! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the Ale house bookmarked since it opened after reading some positive reviews from various sources. Happy to say - the reviews were totally accurate. Good independent brewed beer with cool unique food options.  First the good:  - The Beer. I tried a beer sampler of mixed brews. All were unique and good. They have a broad selection to cover all tastes - just tell them what you like.  - Great service. They clearly know beer here. We used two approaches to order - 1) I let them select my beers and 2) you can tell them the type of beers you like and they will make recommendations. Service also incredibly friendly and fast. When the beer sampler arrives, they explain the choices and give you a paper with the beer names on it.  - Great atmosphere and the place is large (used to be a large Blockbuster if I remember correctly). Simple cool decor but fits the concept perfectly.    - We tried two appetizers. Given their focus on brewing their own beer, I would have expected the food to be an afterthought. But this was not the case, they had creative and flavourful food selections. First up was the pulled pork spring rolls which I loved. Filled with pork that was nicely spiced / sauced. Second was the Samosas, also very unique with a nice blend of flavours. It;s clear that some thought went into their food menu.  On the improve side, I would have preferred a beer menu at the table vs. a chalkboard thats difficult to see from most angles.    I will be back for sure - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Another lunch adventure led me to this place with a few of my homies.  I'd like to say I am a fried chicken connoisseur, because I've tried some of the best in the US, like the famous Roscoe's and Gussie's.  I've heard the word on the street is that the Indie Ale House Southern Fried Chicken is finger lickin', so I put it to the test.  Imma start off by saying, damn this place looks good.  From the exterior, to the interior, to the freaking font choices for their menu and signs, it screams Restoration Hardware ideal showroom!  You can tell the owners made it rain, with the money they invested into this place.  I can only imagine the possibilities if this place was converted into a lounge or club on the weekends.  Now for the main reason I came here, the fried chicken.  Although I'm really a fan of \"bone in\" fried chicken, their chicken breast slices came out nice and crispy.  The meat was as juicy as couture would have wanted it to be and the dipping sauces did not disappoint (only KFC's honey mustard could compare).  Each bite was like heaven being inserted into a chunk of deep fried chicken breast and only a waffle would complete this dish from the gods.  Can you guys put a waffle and maple syrup alongside this dish?  Pretty please with a stick of butter on top?  Thanks Indie Ale House, you've made my waist size go up, but my happiness meter go off the charts.  Dirtybird look out son, you still my go to, but #southernfriedchicken!"}
{"text":"I would love to leave a longer review but im comatose from my Bison Blt ! Its great ! So amazing! The flight of beers was always a smart way to sample soon many delicious beers!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot - packed on a Friday night. The food was actually not too bad - we got wings and they were made fairly quick and had good flavor to them. I also ordered one of their beers (can't remember the name) and that was good too. This experience was nothing too fancy, but it wasn't bad either - I would be open to coming back here again in the future to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"In a time where craft breweries are popping up in every neighbourhood, Indie Ale House  made a positive, lasting impression on me. I am not typically a fan of porters, but their breakfast porter is definitely a highlight! Some sweet notes and not much of a bitter finish. Yum! Also, their pizzas are excellent. Generous heaps of goat cheese on their sausage pizza, on a nice medium-thickness crust. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. There were five of us so I had a chance to try many things. The apps (polenta, popcorn, mahogany ribs) were all good with extra points to the ribs. For mains we had the \"Royale\" short rib burger, the Fried Chicken, Pizza and Mac & Cheese. All were spot on. The burger was nice and meaty / flavourful. The fried chicken was boneless and super juicy. Great potato salad on the side. The pizza crusts are Neapolitan style, thin and springy.   The beer selection is equally good with selections for any mood. Prices are totally reasonable. I came with my kids & a friend and it was great for everyone. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"While the food was excellent, management has no idea how to be professional.    I am not a beer drinker.  Can't stand the stuff.  However, the people that I was with are beer lovers and like the place from their previous visits.  If you dare to want something alcoholic other than beer - be prepared for such a minimalist offer - that you cannot even get plain rum or vodka (though they have a tiny selection of brandy).  When I suggested that they should at least stock something for non-beer drinkers, I was yelled at by management.  Why have 6 or 7 different bottles of brandy but not offer a rum or vodka?  So if you love beer, or don't mind just water, and don't care how you are treated - try the fried chicken...it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, and great beer I had Instigator, Shapeshifter, Red Tape, Breakfast Porter and 10-04-16. All of them dark and bitter. My favorite? Shapeshifter."}
{"text":"Now that I officially live in the Junction, I can see myself spending a lot more time at the Indie Ale House. My non-beer drinking mother and I split a tasting flight of all the \"lighter\" ales, upon the suggestion of the very attentive, knowledgeable and efficient server. Big fan of the \"Broken Hipster\" as well as the current saison, of which the name escapes me now.   For dinner we split the mushroom & kale pizza--who knew kale was actually good on pizza--and the mushroom & truffle mac and cheese, which was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten (highly recommend).  Overall: a good place to bring out of towners, amazing mac and cheese, and you'll even find an ale for the non-beer drinker in tow.  P.S. the to-go-beer store is an added bonus, open to 11pm!"}
{"text":"Have some great BBQ food, staff is friendly and a little shop up front where you can buy some beer to go.  Lots of microbrews on tap."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I'm a regular but I have been about 4 times in the past. I wanted to eat the wings which I had eaten in the past. So I went with the - papaya habanero again.   When I started to eat them I noticed that the sauce was made pretty different than before, this time was very heavily tomato based. Last time it was very papaya based and tasted great. It is very clearly made in house which is awesome but I think if you have different people prepping food you should still make the food consistent.   The food being fairly different from the first time that I had ordered is not my only issue. No one ever came by to ask how my food was. They seemed to have a lot of staff and only around 10 tables seated.  By the time some one did 40 minutes later, my food was cold and we had already been there for close to an hour and a half. The manager that came over to take my complaint was polite but also seemed to have a \"well it's just different\" kinda attitude. I thought it was odd. We never spoke to the same person twice so we didn't really even know who our server was. Anyway it was very slow as we were there for over 2 hours, the food was not what it usually is and the service was disappointing.   I'll probably give it another chance but I will be skeptical before I do so. It's no Mendy's if you're a Seinfeld fan."}
{"text":"Very bustling crowd, even on a weekday.  We reserved for a huge party and since it was a late dinner, we were able to pre-order our choices ahead of time.  Upon arrival, we were all promptly served within half an hour, amazing.  Thin-crust pizzas, burgers and sandwiches were delicious!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot in the Junction! Basically anything you get off the menu will be delicious. I personally suggest the fried polenta, mac n' cheese, and fried chicken. Love getting beer flights at this place as well, great selection. All in all a great spot to grab dinner and drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"To me this place is a slam dunk combination of excellent food, beer and ambiance. Food was the best part, my wife and I shared fried chicken and a beets and goat cheese salad that were both above average. We got a beer sampler that included a few high abv beers.  I love Canada but the beer palate people prefer is usually very light and lacking in flavor such as the ubiquitous pilsner. However to my relief this place sports a more crafty variety with IPA's, Sours and Stouts.   The ambiance here is quite hip, when I was here on a Tuesday night all places were already occupied. A favorite of mine is there were no TV's, my attention gets sucked in with these quite easily so I always appreciate a place that stands on it's own without them."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here for Burgerlicious. The $5 burger was delicious! The meat was definitely hand crafted, it was so tender and juicy.  Be warned, this place is purely a beer drinker's place. They don't have variety in their drinks for the non-beer drinkers unfortunately.  Service was slow, not enough waiters to go around all the tables. My bf finished his meal before his second order of beer arrived. It was already poured at the bar.. but it was sitting there for awhile with a whole other pile of beers waiting to be delivered!  I don't think I would eat here with their regular menu though, a bit overpriced.  They get 2 stars just for the burger. Everything else was mediocre."}
{"text":"Let me preface *This review is only about the food and service.   I have to say both were exceptional! I shared the beet and goat cheese salad which had kale as the main greens. They were prepared wonderfully, soft with enough crunch and very flavourful. Was a great starter. Then the main star showed up! The indie burger on a lettuce bun with fries. Delish all round! I should have taken a photo of the clean plate to vouch for that! Not a crumb left! Haha My company also enjoyed his burger. He had the bison and belly burger and fries. We both were very pleased with the quality of food. You can tell thought was put into the menu and selected dishes. The portions were also very generous.   Now I must say apart from the great food, the service was exceptional. Nick was our server. He was fast, knowledgable and overall extremely helpful. Since I have a gluten intolerance, he was able to tell me what to steer clear of without hesitation and even ensured the kitchen was aware to avoid cross contamination to the best of their ability. On top of that, Nick was very personable. One of the best servers I've had in a long time.   All this to say, I'll be back for sure and most likely enjoy a bevy or two! :)   You'll surely enjoy yourself if you hit them up!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended independent brew house and restaurant. The service and atmosphere here is pretty chill. They have a great selection of craft beers too.   I had the 5 sampler taster, which the waitress helped pick out. She picked a great selection of flavourful, butter, malty beers. I recommend the breakfast porter and gravity well. You can also buy their beers in their small shop connected to the restaurant as well.   As for the food, I got the southern fried chicken, which I knew was good since I tried it here before. I also recommend the Mac and cheese.   I recommend this place for a nice brunch! Cheers"}
{"text":"This place is trying a bit too hard.  Environment:  It's hardly \"indie\" to have a massive restaurant and sign that can be seen from outer space. Furthermore, the interior is atmospherically bereft. A few framed pictures of their more limited edition beer bottle labels and some wooden signs indicating what is on tap for the day. It's cold-feeling, sparse, under-decorated and blank.  Beer:  I've added in an extra star strictly for the helpfulness of the staff and their knowledge of the beers. I'm pretty finicky when it comes to beer, and our server worked with me to figure out what I would like. We definitely enjoyed the beer, but again, it was kind of weird. They have two beers that they charge full price for that are only 3% alcohol. Does anybody drink light beer anymore? Take these two light beers (that are called ANYTHING but light on the menu to detract from their lack of alcohol content), then add them to the other litany of excessively esoteric offerings, and you wind up not having much to keep ordering that's easy-drinking enough to like. Yes, it's interesting to have countless IPAs that have varying sour, citrus-y and vegetal notes. But I don't want to drink repeated glasses of any of them.  Food: Interesting combinations and flavours, but the prices are too steep for what you get (almost as though you're paying a $2-$3 per-plate tax for \"indie-ness\"). $14 macaroni and cheese in a tiny bowl set on a much larger plate occupied with pieces of toasted bread. You leave feeling like you've just spent a lot of $ on something that wasn't entirely satisfying from a place that is just too vague to settle on an identity. It's altogether alienating, and the last place in the world I would deem \"pub-like\". It feels too commercial and insincere, much more like a Milestones than an indie/Junction bar."}
{"text":"Smokehouse/Indie burger, service, atmosphere,  ambience were all 5/5.  Burgers are quite filling.  The kale salad was a nice side as opposed to fries"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. Have only been once but will definitely go back! Yes I know you go for the beer but I do wish they had a couple more wine options. Still not enough of an issue to deter from returning and trying more on the menu - Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Gone here a few times now and I love it! Awesome selection of beer, very good food, and friendly service. Prices a little high and you will have to wait a while as they don't do reservations and it gets very busy. But great experiences and will continue to go back here!!"}
{"text":"Indie has been a favourite of many Junctionites since opening its doors in 2011. They brew their own beers and have at least 2 rotating guest taps.  Favourite brews include the Broken Hipster during the warmer months and anything darker (think IIPAs and stouts) in the winter time.  Last summer they added BBQ Wednesdays to their menu, which includes favourites like smoked brisket (it melts on your tongue), cornbread and BBQ pulled pork. To die for! This ain't your veggie hangout, unless you want to nibble on a side of fries."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Vancouver and came here on a recommendation last Friday night.  We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary so it was a special meal, and just the kind of place we wanted to eat at.  The general manager noticed the gift and card on the table and asked us what we were celebrating.  When we told her she comped us some drinks, which made an already amazing experience even better.  The food was amazing.  I had the fried chicken and my husband had the spicy italian sausage pizza.  We also ordered the beet and goat cheese salad.  Everything was perfectly cooked and fresh.  I can tell their chef has a fine dining background.  We also enjoyed some of their own beers which were quite good.  And they went out of their way to seat us at a nice table away from the area with kids, at my request.  I would definitely come back here on my next visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken was amazing.  Crispy on the outside and juicy and soft on the inside.  The portion size was big and I have enough Left for lunch.  Selection of beers is excellent.  I will repeat.  Soon"}
{"text":"Indie is a Junction gem. My husband and I are both craft beer snobs and we're consistently impressed with the selection and taste. Neither of us are a fan of hoppy beers and there is always a great variety of beer varieties for every palate. In fact so much so, that I virtually always want to get a flight so I can try all the beers that sound interesting.  Although I've ordered food here far fewer times than I've ordered beer, the dishes I have  tried have been delicious. The bison and belly burger was juicy and filling, the French onion soup warmed my belly and tasted so fresh and wholesome. The duck pizza is also super tasty!   The atmosphere is cozy and overall it's a great place to meet friends for a casual dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Indie Ale House is located on Dundas St W on the north side near the north west corner of Dundas and Keele in The Junction.  The Junction has sure changed from the times where Canadian Tire south of the underpass and grain silos used to be the background of where the train overpassed the area with the broken bridge of Old Weston road was working/notworking for years.  This area from Keele to Dupont/Annette has changed.  The area west of Keele to Jane has changed and businesses have turned around.  There used to be a police station on Mavety and they've since moved it to what used to be a school on Davenport near Symington.  The Junction has changed a lot.    My very first review for Yelp was for a business just across the street from Indie Ale House so it's a nice way to reminisce as to where I was and where I am now as far as Yelp is concerned.  The very same app I used to make a reservation at Playa Cabana has now sort of brought me full circle, back to the Junction which is a neighborhood that I've known well since my in laws live nearby.  Indie Ale House is a place to sit down, have beer and eat something as well.  My first visit around 6pm on a Friday and the front storefront was open so it was a nice open air feel near the front.  The rest of the footprint seems rather crowded whether in low top tables or the bar, the place was pretty full from front to back.  I ended up sitting at the bar and ready to try one of the many drinks.  Although they have a printed menu, it was explained that the most up to date menu was on the wall.  That sort of makes sense since they can run out of something or new offerings can be introduced without always having to print something out.  For the Friday that I went to Indie, I was actually there twice within a few hours.  The first time was to wait for my friends to come because we were going to eat nearby and I wanted to have a snack and a drink and the second time was to just have drinks after we ate dinner.  The first visit for the evening I ended up having a couple Instigator IPA which is a west coast style pale ale.  I ended up ordering a plate of fried chicken which comes in two ways, original and Nashville Hot.  I noticed that Nashville Hot is slowly but surely becoming a thing and what was served up was a 4 pieces of deboned thigh, floured and deep fried with a kick of spice.  This plate was served with a side of potato salad.  I'm used to seeing the chicken itself resting on a single piece of Texas toast with pickles on top but this time, no bread.  I liked the chicken.  Being that it's thigh it's juicier and IMO has more taste than breast meat.  The coating was good but not really as hot as I was hoping for but it still had a good taste.  Our second go around after dinner I was just interested in a single beer.  My friends each got a flight customized to what their preferences were.  What I liked to see what their 5 glass flights actually came with a tiny print out of what they were having so they knew which beer was which.  I found that quite helpful if you sampled something you really liked, you knew which one to order again for next time.  Overall Indie is a busy place with some menu options but the draw for this place is their beer.  They have a side store for take home in cans in with an attractive fridge with their products on display."}
{"text":"Excellent native brewery! Take Rabbit and follow it ))  Indeed, the beer there is outstanding, pairing it with bison burgers and tuna tacos!  A bit pricy though."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Beers and food are great.  Lot of beer places like this seem to take themselves too seriously and come across snobby, but here the atmosphere is epic, feels glamorous and the staff from what I have seen so far is very professional and polite.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff, but the beer is okay.  If you like beer that tastes like coffee farted into an orange peel."}
{"text":"I've fallen \"in like\" with this place, but not in love -- based on vibe, food and cost. The service is excellent, so a big shout out for that off the top.  The upshot: it's a fairly large, upscale craft brew resto-bar that feels like it was transported from a suburb into the city. It's a reliable place for food and drink. The Instigator IPA is indeed great, the burgers are indeed huge, but there's something a bit too box store about this place for me to get fully on board.  We dropped in once just for beer. The place was packed, so we were seated near the back, in view of the kitchen window. We were impressed by the food and burger platters coming out of there and thought we should return for a meal. We came back and tried the Indie Burger. This is a classic, two-patty bacon cheeseburger that tasted a lot like a Big Mac (special sauce, iceberg lettuce). It was huge and sloppy in a good way, but there was still something ordinary about it. Not just because it was the house burger -- there are ways to make even classic burgers stand out. One drawback for me from the get-go was that the bun had been toasted, but the top was very cold to the touch. (Wish I'd paid the $2 extra for lettuce wrap instead of the bun!) The bunned burger is $18, with fries or salad included. Don't get me wrong -- it was good. I'd just hoped for something a bit more memorable.    And I might be getting the suburban association from the bathroom -- it's crazy bright in there and completely unadorned. You feel like you're in a gas station restroom at night. A re-think of the fixtures and decor in here would go a long way."}
{"text":"This is a regular favourite spot for us. I love beer and they make damn good beer here, I look forward to their collaborative brews. You definitely want to get a flight of beer (or more) to sample their variety. The staff knows their beer and will recommend some beers to your liking. The food is also awesome. They make one of the best burgers in the city. Their southern fried chicken is also amazing - so amazing that I was carrying some leftovers home when I dropped a piece of chicken on the floor at Cornerstone and didn't hesitate to pick it up off the floor and eat it later - not something I would normally do! This is also our go to spot when taking friends out or family from out of town. Never had a bad meal or experience here. It's always busy, but dinner time is just packed."}
{"text":"been here so many times now!  mostly for late beers.  their beer is amazing.  love how they have guest beers as well...always appreciate the great lakes here.  we had the flights and have had pints.  favourite beers so far are the love triangle ipa and the instigator.  barnyard and cockpuncher are pretty awesome too.  the place gets packed for dinners and nights on fridays/saturdays...it tends to get quite loud.  we love the fried chicken - can't remember when the last time i had such an amazing piece of crispy-on-the-outside-juicy-on-the-inside chicken.  we were also blown away by the chicken wings - maple licorice!  the duck pizza was okay...may be it was an off pizza day..ours was a bit dry that night.  the dessert we got the trio - pot de creme, brownie, and toffee pudding...YUM YUM YUM!  definitely not a weekly place for dinner because i would probably do a repeat of the fried chicken, wings, and the trio dessert!   this is our go-to place for beers!  they also have a take-out area...you can get growlers here and other swag."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Once with my husband and once with a group of friends. The food is pretty good.  I had the fig and pig pizza and it was pretty yummy.  My husband is a beer drinker and he enjoyed trying the different beers. The service has been so so both times we went. they charge an 18% min tip for parties larger than 5 people which I have never seen in a restaurant before (usually it would be 8 or more people I think?)  I guess our waitress knew she was getting a good tip so she put minmal effort in - we had to flag her down more than once to order more drinks.  Another downside to the Indie Ale House is that they don't have a full bar - no rum or gin and I think only 2 different kinds of wine.  so if you are going with a group make sure everyone in your group likes beer.  I didn't realize this ahead of time and I felt bad because one of our friends is not a big beer drinker and tried to order a rum and coke.  on a positive note the hostess was very friendly and made an extra effort to accommodate our larger group I live in the Roncy area so I am not sure if I would go back but I would recommend giving it a try if you are in the Junction and you like beer."}
{"text":"@indiealehouse  Okay, to be honest we only came here tonight because it was finally! Open and because I really wanted the FTR. Woohoo!  One of 3 locations in the high Park /Junction area, the craft in house brewery has 10 beers to choose from. IPAs , Stouts, Wheat beer and a raseberry sour.  Wach is about $5-6 and a serving (usually a pint-ish) depends on the beer you get.  Youcan also get a flight of beers to try everything. We didn't get a chance to try because they ran out of glasses.   They also have a menu which at 10pm on a Friday night the kitchen was closed.  Maybe this won't be the case in the future. On the menu was a Parmesean and Sage Popcorn ($3) Chilli Cheese Fries, Poutine, Wings $9 and other pub fare like pizza and mac and cheese ($12-14)   Servers were really friendly and knowledgeable.   They just opened last night ! But could have more decor on the walls and the bathroom light was too bright. It was also extremely stuffy and humid. I hope they will put in some ventilation. Minor details.   Great for groups. Lou but manageable. Fun and energetic vibe."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one night to have a bite and try some beers. Because there were only two of us we sat in a uber small booth away from the rest of the restaurant tables, beside the bar.  Seating was a bit annoying but whatever.  We ordered a shrimp po boy and the angry hawaiian pizza. Pizza was fantastic. Loved the heat and the house made bacon. The po-boy was really nice as well but a lot of breading on the shrimp. The beers were great, awesome selection, something for everyone.    Update: went back last week... sat at the bar, had a pint and shared a pizza and the shrimp tacos. Both were awesome. The service is great and they played MMJ's whole last album which was wicked. Unfortunately my bf and I drank too much craft beer at the Craft Beer fest in the summer and can only handle one beer now... but we will definitely be back for a quick bite and sit at the bar for a bit. Nice vibe, cool place and I'll continue to go back.  Would like to bring a larger group so we can finally get to sit a some of the other tables!"}
{"text":"Now that I've visited IAH a number of times since my last review I can safely say that it is, hands down, my go to bar in the Junction.  Since opening, IAH has expanded their craft brew selection to include an ever changing line-up of  porters, stouts, and wheats along with their IPA's.  As I'm not a fan of IPA's in general I stick with the other options and have yet to be disappointed. I am particularly fond of their Breakfast Porter, Wit'ner Toque, Quiet Time, Icebreaker and Red Tape Stout, i.e., any dark, strong beer. One of the nice things is that all of their beers regardless of the alcohol content are roughly the same price (~$5.50).  The servers are all pleasant and many have been there since the start, which adds to the venue's community feel. They do not take reservations on Friday or Saturday  nights after 5pm so I would suggest getting there before 6pm if you don't want to wait for a table.  The menu (which also changes frequently) is much better than your average pub. Their modern take on standard dishes (e.g., Scotch Bonnet flavoured Chicken Wings, Shrimp Taco, Aubergine Burger, ect.) all at a reasonable price (~$15.50) have never left me wanting.  I especially like the Mac & Cheese w/ pulled pork, Pizza w/ sausage and goat cheese and Pork Rib Burger.  The lighting still bugs me, but the service, great food and most importantly phenomenal selection of unique craft beers at a reasonable price far outweigh this.  I would recommend IAH to anyone who likes, or wants to sample a wide range of craft beers."}
{"text":"Like the place, open late, good service, and good lighting, yes the place is so bright.  Good beer, well sometimes they are sold out. Well I am not going to hold that against them, sure it's still a good place.  Margherita pizza is great, so is the fried chicken if you want to indulge. Little bit loud but that just what makes it warm and vibe."}
{"text":"Tasty food, high energy but there is definitely a \"not so customer friendly\" attitude.   Used to go on a very regular basis (at least twice a month with friends) but the last couple visits there have been some minor issues.   Went with a group of friends and the waiter said its their policy not to provide individual bills only one bill for the group - ok, not such a big deal, but  some people coming late, some leaving early, some eating and some not drinking - just easier if they track it.  Sure, minor issue but other places are providing individual bills if you ask.   Went with my family of 4 for an early dinner - in at 6 pm - asked for a booth (restaurant was basically empty) but was told the booths are for groups of 5 or 6.  So we were seated at a table for 4, our food arrives and there is not enough space on the table for the food - we keep having to jockey everything around. We finish our meal at 7:30 and the booths are still empty.  Ok, minor issue but it's another thing.   On a separate visit, my wife is not a beer drinker so she orders a soft drink and asked for a lime wedge. Well, we found out that lime wedges are not available for soft drinks. The staff encouraged us to email the manager. So my wife did, and she received a response from the owner, which was polite but basically said their focus is beer and they will not put any effort into anything that detracts from their support of beer drinkers.    We have not been back to the Indie since the \"lime incident\"."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the beer is amazing and you can get a flight of whatever you choose!!! The food is outta this world. Best fried chicken (tied with bar Isabel) in the city, same can be said for burgers. Get em both!"}
{"text":"This place is moving people!  Don't think you'll get a spot on a weekend afternoon. We tried, ending up quitting (towards cold spring and line length). We crossed the street, found an advertisement, jumped inside a Hole in The Wall (also cool with less waiting).  Today evening was busy, not full (yet). Once seated at the bar I started to analyze part of the hip. Blonde-good looking males and females (check), easy going vibe (yes), a description of original fermented beers (double palomita), was the food going to be good? Yes, it was! Everything tasted above average!  We tried the tiny tuna taquitos. I ate them in 4 bites, which permitted me to see the guac at the bottom, smell the savour of that excellent sesame oil, feel the crispiness on my tongue, feel wild without been messy with the crunch (when handling this pieces of art carefully). Squeeze a lil limón, throw some drops of salsa, mmms (I also saw it was quite a popular option).  Burger speaking:  Portion sized considerably good for a big eater;  Good buns!  My favourite so far: the one with pork belly and fries ( the kale salad you must ask if you want to balance).  The other burger I'm confused due to a 5 flight beer amusement. We'll be back to figure out what have we asked for and what we've been forgetting we asked for..."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Indie Ale House last night with a group of 6 and I must say, with what they are doing after only a few months of being in business I am really excited for the future.   Beer wise I did a flight of 5 samples ($13) and a pint of their \"jump the shark\" American strong ale ($5.50). My favourite was probably the \"jump the shark,\" lots of roast flavour with just enough hops to balance it out, it packs a punch at 9.5% but is surprisingly drinkable for such a high alcohol content, tread lightly my friends. Their \"zombie apocalypse\" imperial stout was also very good with lots of rich coffee flavours. Lastly the \"cockpuncher\" double IPA had a nice hoppy bite but was not overwhelmingly bitter, well done. I sampled their other IPA and an English mild which were both pretty good. The one beer that was a flop was their \"truth and consequences\" Belgian dubbel which was far too sweet and didn't have any of the good characteristics of a Belgian dubbel. I like that this place has a variety of different beers, they do have some good ones but IMO none of the beers I had were spectacular. Bonus points for having clever names on all their beers!   Our group decided to order 2 appetizers to share, squash samosas and pulled pork spring rolls. The samosas were interested, the dough was more like dessert dough than samosa dough, the filling was sweet but everything was balanced out by the accompanying soy sauce, all in all a decent dish. The spring rolls were nice and flaky, stuffed to the brim with pulled pork and served with a spicy sriracha sauce (home made apparently), this dish had a nice balance of flavour and texture, I enjoyed it.   The place itself is quite large with lots of tables and bar seating. It has an American tavern feel due to all the exposed wood in the décor. The service was outstanding; our waitress was very knowledgeable about her beer selection and was unafraid to make a recommendation. When picking my sampler I just rattled of some styles I wanted to try and she gave me a short explanation about what they had in each style. She checked up on us regularly and was always quick to bring us water or crack a joke. Definitely 5 star service!   Overall I really enjoyed my time here; I like what they are trying to do. This is definitely a place you could hang out for the night and do some solid drinking, or just come in for a quick pint. Everything from food to beer is reasonably priced, and I especially like that they are not trying to be super chic or trendy. That being said, although many of their beers are good I feel there is room for improvement, I'm excited and hopeful that these guys will continue to improve. I will definitely be back.   *3.5 stars for now"}
{"text":"First time here on Friday night. Hostess said it could be a wait of an hour plus for our party of six but it only took about a half hour.   Had the short rib beef burger with fries. Burger was solid but not unbelievable. Fries were good and I liked the sauce they brought with it. In house hot sauce was good too.   Tried the famous fried chicken too and thought it was great.   Sadly we didn't get any pizza.   A few of us got flights of beer which were pretty fun. Your choice of five sample size beers for $10-$15 depending on your choices. You get a fair amount and it's great to try some of the different varieties. I tried a few odd ones and didn't like them all haha, but that's my fault. Good selection to choose from.   Place has a fun vibe too."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a few drinks and some food with friends. The beer is great, the ambience warm, and the food is actually pretty good as well. It's not too loud to chat, just loud enough to have a lively feel to it."}
{"text":"I tried the fried chicken with their hot and nasty sauce. We also tried the prosciutto plate as well. It was quite good. The chicken was a little less crispy than I expected but the seasoning was very good.  The establishment does get quite busy so don't be surprised if you can't seem to get the attention of a waitress or waiter easily. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that for groups , they automatically charged a 20 % tip. Which I thought was a little excessive.  I would have understood something along the lines of 15 to 18. But 20 seemed like a bit much. Especially with the large bill that we had already to begin with."}
{"text":"We went to Indie Ale House on a Sunday night. The place has a nice and relaxed atmosphere. I was afraid it was going to be be too much on the hipster side, but I'm glad that it wasn't.  We sat down and ordered the flight of beers which gave you small samples of five beers. Since there was two of us, we tried ten different beers at the suggestion of our server, who was very friendly. The selection of beers are from independent brewers and changes constantly. They're very heavy on the IPA, which I'm not a fan of. But that's really on me and not on them.  We ordered the the tuna tacos for appetizer and the bison and the side ribs burger as main. The tuna tacos were phenomenal, fresh tasting, and the shells were crunchy. The burgers were absolutely amazing. Definitely recommended.  Overall, I really recommend this place. Relaxed atmosphere, attentive servers, and quick service."}
{"text":"Some of the best craft brew in the city with delicious food to match! I'm a regular at the Indie and have yet to sample something I don't love. The beer flights are a great way to discover the beers, though I'm partial to the Broken Hipster, the Witner Toque and Glory and Consequences. There are lots of hoppy IPA choices too, of course, but it's one of the only craft breweries in the city that has delicious options for the non-hoppy beer drinkers too. There's a retail store so you can pick up your favourite growlers too. In January of each year they sell a limited number of memberships where you get a monthly growler...but they do sell out quickly. Delicious pizzas, burgers, smoked meat specials and the bacon grano padano popcorn is a must."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is realllly good! I'm not a beer person but my friend just love the beer there."}
{"text":"Mostly sours.. lemonade stand -sour- it's delicious, so good, the lemon gives it a kick. Spadina monkey -cherry sour- has a tart flavor.. hmmm amazing. Macaroni and cheese with mushroom was perfect, the bread, soft but crunchy at the same time was yummy. Magic mushroom Pizza was great, that crust!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and it was very good, the traditional Italian type. Service was very courteous and prompt as well.   I waited all year for the Xmas Porter beer but unfortunately it didn't taste as gingerbready as last years batch however still good. They had a storefront which I bought a few C*ckpunchers and they put everyone on a good buzz at my party so kudos to that."}
{"text":"The Junction is admittedly a cool area, but not one that I venture into frequently. In the name of craft beer, a mission was made and the Indie Ale House was the destination of choice. And the mission was all in all a great success.  We arrived on a Thursday night and found the place bustling with activity, so we saddled up at the bar. The restaurant is very much the standard brew pub vibe - brick and beam interior, reclaimed wood tables, and a bright but comfortable environment surrounding it. Bartender was friendly and informative and didn't make us feel rushed when asking questions of beers or food.  On tap they have what I would estimate to be around 10 or so of their own beers including a cask, and 2 then guest taps (occupied by Toronto's Blood Brothers and US craft brand Sierra Nevada on my visit). Glass size can vary from 20oz to 16oz to 10oz depending on the beer of choice, but they also do flights which were actually decent sized samples, which is always nice for that tasting vibe if you don't want to commit to a single beer or drinking too many pints of various things in the name of trying them all. I tried a bunch of things and really enjoyed all of them, but my favourite was their 11% IPA with the ever so fun name of \"Cockpuncher\". A couple of these to round out the night and even the coldest winter chill will be tolerable upon leaving.  On the food front, my friend raved about their mac n cheese, and the person beside me had an epic looking plate of fried chicken, but I was feeling the burger vibe so went with the Bison and Belly Burger which had a bison patty and some nice fatty porkbelly within. Admittedly this was one of the messiest burgers I've had in a while as they also slather the sandwich in coleslaw. It was quite good though despite the dripping and oozing mess that it left my hands, plate, and general area in front of me. Fries on the side were a bit meh, and in full disclosure I really wasn't impressed by the aioli dipping sauce or their house made ketchup. But it was still a good and satisfying plate of food.  Last point of mention, is the bottle shop. $5 - $7 for 500ml bottles of their fine brews to take home is a steal. I'm happy to know that there is another Cockpuncher experience waiting for me at home tonight, however weird that may sound."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I was really looking forward to trying out the bison burger. The burger was good but it could have been better. The pork belly was rather unnecessary - instead of adding a creamy texture to the burger, I found it really slippery and heavy. The charcuterie and cheese boards were good - it was quite an experience for me trying out horse meat for the first time (it wasn't actually that bad!). Service was good. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Indie Alehouse - I just wish the bison and belly burger was better executed and that the prices weren't so high."}
{"text":"To be honest I wasn't too impressed with the craft beer offered despite the large selection. I tried everything on the tasting menu and only 2 out of probably about 12 beers were tasty - and thats coming from a huge daily beer drinker. I always like to support local but probably won't go back. You be the judge."}
{"text":"I can't lie when I first arrived at Indie, I was a bit disappointed as it wasn't what I was expecting. However, I still decided to give it a try as it was a friends birthday. I started with a bourbon and had the Blanton's, which was nice and I started to feel better about eating there.   I started with the fried chicken, which was an OMG moment as it was DELICIOUS! At our table we snacked in the fries, which have to be some of the best I've ever had. I finished the night with a glass of their Rabbit of Caerbannog....WOW! I know that's a beer I'd like to try again.   To top it off, our server who's name is Jen, was AMAZING...so knowledgeable and was everything that we could have wanted in service staff. Management needs to acknowledge her efforts and praise her. Job well done Jen.   We will be back and we would like Jen to be our server. Highly recommended place."}
{"text":"Burgers that are a force to be reckoned with. The indie burger is a massively upgraded big mac and their \"royale\" burger is serious force of meat, crispy onions and aioli. The ambience is casual yet classy. Great for a date or friends hangout. For footage of the food and location visit our youtube channel at  https://youtu.be/pFFNEVKvF24   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here with my teammates after our ball hockey game nearby on a Monday night.  This place was packed for a Monday but we still managed to get seated near the back, we did have around 12 people!  First thing that caught my eyes are the amount of beer they offer, I was told by the waiter they brew their own beer, so some of the beers on their menu are exclusive,  I ordered the Rye So Sour beer and it was AMAZING!  I never had a sour beer before but that beer was so delicious and easy to drink!  For my main, i ordered their signature fried chicken.  The chicken comes with a side and two dipping sauce.  The chicken was fried to perfection!  Nice and crispy on the outside but the inside was still so juicy and tender!  Fried Chicken with a beer, that combo pretty much completes your protein recovery after a sport!  I will definitely be back again!  Was such a great find in the neighborhood!  Will for sure try their beer samples next time (they let you choose 5 beers off their menu and give you a sample of each to try!)"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer here....food was outsanding, the deep fried palenta was one of the best I've ever had and the pulled pork sandwich was great definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a date.   Went here on a Tuesday evening at 8 and the place was busy, but not packed - got a table for 6 immediately (plus, I don't think they take reservations anyways).   I got flight sampler (sample 5 beers of your choice). That was great with getting to try the variety of beers and the staff are quite knowledgable about the different types of beers and figuring out what you would like. I found the beers to be good, but nothing incredible. I wouldn't really come back for the beer. However....  The food was really really good. I got the mushroom and kale pizza and everything about was perfect. Awesome dough and toppings. Plus, it's a great size for only $15 (I was completely stuffed).   Friends got the fried chicken and burgers. Fried chicken seemed to be a big hit. I got to try some and it was tasty. 3 big pieces of boneless chicken was definitely a plus, especially because I only expected it to be 1 piece.   The burger I can't speak of - never tried it. Friends seemed to like it, but it didn't seem to be absolutely amazing.   The food is something that will bring me back, along with the great atmosphere and friendly staff.   Side note: no tvs. I didn't mind, but friends were a bit upset when we couldn't watch the Jays game."}
{"text":"Well.  The Junction has some great food places . Very much commercial drive in Vancouver for the over all feel and mix of crowd / neighbourhood. This place I have to say has excellent trained staff . Friendly and knowledgable , an unusual find in \"too urban for you TO\" Only one other place exceeded the service I received.  Decor was great , vibe was great , there was however an abundance of skinny jeans, beards and manbuns, that however is not the restaurants falt! I'm a rum guy so beer is not my thing .  Group said it was good . The food  however. Was a bit on the ambitious side ,sometimes  have a few signature items that colour outside the lines and maintain the standard items with flair . My pork belly bison burger had too many competing tastes that did not gel  well together with no one stand out , the smoked Gouda was lost in the equation as was the flavour of the bison , the pork belly was to dominant . The bison also had some crunchy Boney bits !  Rework the burger, you will get it ! The retro cola was good , and again Service awesome!"}
{"text":"I can't really talk too much about the beer because by the time you read this their beer selection may have changed. They seem to change their beers often enough to always have something new to try.  Their beer selection is on these wooden boards that are quite awesome. They also have this chalk board near the bar which will tell you what's coming up. And it keeps you wanting to come back.  But it's quite hard to get a table here. The food, I didn't get to try much but  - Black truffle popcorn - I think the flavor of the black truffle is quite unique for the popcorn and is definitely something good to nibble on - The beignets - I'd probably pass the next time on these. They were good donuts, but not great beignets; there are probably a good six of them so a good share dessert  Their beer list, most people come for this. It's really based on preference so it's hard to say. They appear to be doing a lot more collaborations than I remember the first time coming. This can be good and bad, I think it's good as it just has more brains trying to come up with the next great beer.  They have a storefront that you can buy beers from including your hipster growler.  Here's what I'm not a fan of. How every beer has a different size of glass. I'm not sure how they decide I can get 9oz vs a 16.5oz. But you really gotta pay attention to those stats but it's good the board tells you how many fluid ounces, alcohol % and price.  I hear the pizza is great and the menu looks fantastic. I must come back for some food. One thing, not sure if it's a recurring thing but it has the smokey smell in it that leaves me smelling like I came from a campfire. So nice clothes beware!"}
{"text":"I love the Indie Ale House. I have never been much of a beer drinker but they have something for everyone in their beer selection and the sample flight of five beers is super fun to try. We always have a good time when we go here. The service is fabulous and most of the servers we have had are very knowledgable about the beers.  I have been converted into a craft beer lover.   As far as the food goes I have only ever had appetizers which have been great and very affordable when sharing with a friend.  All is all this is a great neighbourhood gem. Love it."}
{"text":"Indie Ale House is a newly minted institution in an up-and-coming west-end Toronto neighbourhood. I discovered this brewpub accidentally one day whilst looking for something else (hint: beer), then dragged a friend in another night to check it out.  The slick, hip and unpretentious interior is exactly what I Imagine what a modern watering hole would look like. Their pizzas are so lovely, soft and flavourful. But remember, you're really here for their beers. Snap out of it, pizza boy.  The fine folks here are knowledgeable about the beers they make (and can only be obtained here) and will help you choose based on preferences or what you will be eating (at least, that was the impression I picked up from the service a table next to us got). There's also the option of ordering beer-tasting sample trays of 5 each.  However, since we like all sorts of beers and are up for anything, but not having any clue about the in-house brews, we opted to just select stuff at random, based on their witty names (which in my opinion, is the way it should be done--the best strategy for a situation like this). I particularly enjoyed their \"Broken Hipster\" wit.  However however, be forewarned that the taster samplers may be $10/tray to begin with, they will charge $1-2 extra per premium selection, usually the higher-alcohol stuff. That, I do not like. Seems sneaky--and they will tell you about this--but the brewpub's uninitiated may be in for a drunken sticker shock when the bill arrives. Washroom's at the back, buddy, just in case.  Sitting at the storefront window bar at a weekend may afford you views of bar-hopping broken hipsters stumbling drunkenly around the Junction.  {TTC: 40, 41 or 89 bus to Keele/Dundas}"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after Lady Beer Fest. The wait time was significantly less than what we were quoted. There is a small sales shop outside the restaurant area, but still contained within the building.  The brewery has a very large dining hall, but we took seats in the bar. Our barmaid was very lovely, knowledgeable and entertained our requests for samples. I finally settled for the Outrageous Fortune, which included chenin blanc grapes in its fermentation? Production? Overall, I found the taste too sour. After tasting different samples at the beer fest, this one didn't have a great taste.  Notwithstanding, we asked for recommendations on food and she didn't hesitate on the Southern Fried Chicken. I also had noticed that was the dish that coming out the most frequently from the open kitchen. I ordered it Nashville hot and let me tell you, it was HOT!  The dish came with 3 pieces, potato salad, and ranch sauce, hot & honey mustard sauce on the side. The chicken was indeed spicy so the honey mustard was lost on me, meaning, I barely dipped my chicken in it! It would be nice to have another sauce to complement the heat from the hot version of fried chicken. I ate the salad and chicken! It was delicious!  Come prepared to eat heartily and to leave with a satiated belly!"}
{"text":"Popped in the other evening while out for a stroll with an out of townee and stayed for a few drinks. The tasting flight for 15 bucks a yard was the way to go for me. It comes offering up 5 samples of your choice of beverage at what I would guess was around 4 ounces per sample. Bartender neatly ordered them along in a flavour progression from to dark to light and had me drink them in that order.  Inside it was lively, warm, well lit ,and very clean. I had a great experience with my bartender - Very pleasant.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very laid back, and friendly. We have had two flights, sampled the bacon popcorn, the Parmesan wings, and will finish splitting a burger. The Ale house has the right atmosphere to take in Toronto. They have New Holland beer barrel bourbon whiskey. I am definitely a fan, welcome to Toronto folks."}
{"text":"The food is actually better than the beer. Great bar food. Burgers, sandwichEd and more. Salads are well above average. The house beers all disappoint. Stick with the guest pours."}
{"text":"Salads are brilliant, beautiful and actually doesn't taste like your average garden.  There is also an amazing selection of pizza and other dishes.   But what you SHOULD get is the beer shooters. SO worth it. You get to try 5 different beers (and they have GREAT beers).   QUINOA SALAD (15): BLESSED. Nuff said.  Beers: Don't much remember (meaning it was great). Got the Breakfast Porter and some chocolate beer. Honestly try the dark beers; these are one not to be played with though.   Overall would come here again and try out the other salads/pizzas.   ^^"}
{"text":"Good selection of classes of beers and mains. I've been here twice.  First time I had the fried chicken. It was delicious, but be warned, extremely salty. I couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload.  Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main. How do you run out of sides so early in the evening?  Service not so great.  I'd avoid coming here on wednesdays."}
{"text":"The beer was so good - I ordered the \"Broken Hipster\" beer. It had a citrus-y taste to it. It reminded me of another brewery on Ossington which I liked a lot. Or maybe it was the same beer.. haha  For the appetizer, we got the BBQ ribs - the flavour was well marinated into the meat. For the main, we ordered the fried chicken and the mac & cheese. It was delicious! The fried chicken was crispy and the meat was very tender. (No more KFC/Popeyes after this! lol) The mac & cheese with mushrooms: The macaroni wasn't mushy, which is the way I liked it cooked, and the mushrooms absorbed a lot of the flavouring.   The main dishes definitely beats the appetizer :)"}
{"text":"Whether deliberate or not, the pent up expectations due to the long delayed opening may have led to a heightened expectation difficult to fulfill, but this addition to the growing Junction scene is a welcome one.  The craft beers were varied and fragrant.  The Spadina Monkey was a delicious curiosity as it had a tangy citrus effervescence that I am not sure I have come across before.  The porter was also good.  The food was okay, and requires additional visits.  Full marks for the fresh-cut fries cooked in clean oil for a crisp finish.  The pulled pork sandwich was frankly a bit disappointing as it was described as a Carolina BBQ sauce, but came out rather thin and watery.  Michelle had the vegetarian pizza and raved about it as have other reviewers.  Next trip I get the pizza.  A super cool feature is the ability to take beer out.  They sell Growlers (2L jug) on the way out, so you can enjoy their wares at home.  This feature has a very \"Brit\" feel to it, and not something seen much in T.O.  The atmosphere won't be everyone's cup of tea-- there is the constant smell of hops, which I like, but my kids don't.  There is background music barely audible over the din created by high ceilings and hardwood floors.  There are no TVs, so look elsewhere if trying to catch the game.  Some local art on the walls, but mostly spartan, complete with unfinished, bare wood draught taps behind the bar.  Service was on the slow end of the scale, but very friendly.  Looking forward to the next trip back."}
{"text":"I've been a few times for food and beer over the past month, and have sourced the bottle shop on other occasions.   The beer: Excellent. I prefer IPAs and their Instigator is outstanding. Solid hops with a great blend of citrus and floral combinations. I really like their Imperial, Cockpuncher, but it's a bit more of a commitment at 11% APV. The Carrot Cake harvest brew they had out in the early Fall was surprisingly good. Subtle and unusual. Up there with Bellwoods as one of my favourite breweries.    The food is great.The maple/licorice wings were a revelation and the anchovy pizza with arugula is outstanding. I've had the French Onion soup and the mussels laced with bacon, too. Very good. Lately, they've been offering a spiced bacon appetizer/dessert with a dipping sauce of dark chocolate. It's solid.   Tonight, I tried a pint of one of their collaboration brews, a Granite IPA. I didn't like it. It suffered from  lack of carbonation and a soapy foam. I should have asked for a sample before but alas...I mentioned this to the server, and then ordered an Instigator. She whisked away my unfinished pint of the Granite. When the bill came, I was pleasantly surprised that she didn't charge me for it. The service has been consistently attentive and unpretentious.   It is generally pretty busy, even mid-week.   I would gladly give 5 stars if the bottle shop was more consistent. As I understand it, they're in the midst of an equipment upgrade. Having regular supply, with variety, as well as an online bottle shop stock listing, would bump them to 5 stars.  They are a solid 4.5/5. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"The food is to die for, and the beer is the best in town.  Everyone else is recommending their favourite beer, so I'll focus on the food.  - The fried chicken will make you cry, that's how good it is. - The burger is the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. - The Mac n cheese is the ultimate comfort food. - If you're a vegetarian, the pizza or the eggplant sandwich will change your life.  Incredible fare, great service, stylish atmosphere.  The owner Jason has a true a passion for his work and is genuinely a really nice guy, which makes you feel good about spending your money there.  This is a gem in the up-and-coming Junction and you may as well make it your regular hangout now, because it's going to happen sooner or later."}
{"text":"The Indy Ale House is an up and coming establishment.  One is impressed upon arrival by the decor.  It's a well-done space.  The tanks are prominently on display so you know it's a real brewery, and it looks like it could be an actual proper gastropub.    This review is based on two visits, somehow both on snowy nights.  The warm interior and tasty beer were a very welcome respite from the cold outside.  I would characterize service as fairly informal, but make no mistake, the servers know and have opinions on their beer and food.  That's always a bonus compared to a place like Sin and Redemption where the service staff is not allowed to taste their own beers.  On both visits, a pizza was in the works.  The first time, I was with a vegetarian and it was an excellent mushroom pizza.  The crust was thin and crispy, and the toppings were just right.  My second visit brought somewhat different results.  The ground duck pizza (novel, huh?) was inartfully prepared.  The sage that seasoned it was barely chopped, so depending on the bite, the sage was woefully overpowering or completely absent.  The toppings were sparse and inharmonious with the highly acidic tomato sauce.  The crust was also less well executed.  Both visits also involved starches.  On the first visit, we had some excellently cooked fries with a nice aioli and sriracha ketchup.  I was generally impressed with the freshness and crisipiness.  Visit number two, brought a marked decline in quality with a poutine that sort of missed the mark....a bit lukewarm, overly sweet, and with pulled pork that came off as incongruous.    The beers here are generally a solid effort.  At least one taster was had on both visits, and I was generally impressed with the results.  This is a solid microbrew establishment where the beers are clearly better than the big Toronto microbrews, e.g. Mill Street, Steamwhistle, etc.; however, my friends and I agreed that they did not offer serious competition in any style to the excellent Bellwoods brews.  One caveat is in order with the tasters, which are served in classy looking wooden trays.  The server told us the taste was $10 for 5 tasters, which appear to be in the 3-4 oz range....that's fine, it's a bit of a premium on a pint to reflect the extra effort.  However, she failed to mention that many of the beers incur an additional $1 charge...this seemed to apply to not only high alcohol beers, but also low-alcohol guest beers, so most tasters were actually $12-$13, or almost double a pint.   It just feels a tiny bit sneaky to me.  I hate surprises when I get a bill.  Overally, the Indy Ale House is a solid up and coming effort that I'd like to encourage.  Good but not great (and slightly inconsistent) food and beverages are plentiful in a welcoming, well-designed gastropub environment.  And kudos to them for putting their washrooms on the ground floor--finally, a decent place that's handicapped accessible."}
{"text":"Great beer and food, very busy and popular place. They only serve the beer they produce and now serve Whiskey, Scotch and Bourbon. They wait staff are knowledgeable about drink and food pairings. If you like your beer to be robust and not the typical mass produced stuff you get at the beer store you will enjoy it.  Food is really good, try the smoked wings, excellent. They even have a store so you buy and bring their beer home with you.  This is not your typical pub, doesn't have TV's plastered everywhere, good place to be with friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up here by complete accident. We made a special trip across town to go to the Playa Cabana Cantina, but when we got there, they were closed for a special event. Hungry and cold, we picked the first other place we saw across the street, which was Indie Ale House. We had never heard of it, and I'm SO glad we ended up coming here!  We were seated right away even though they were busy. Our waitress was super sweet and helpful. We both had beers (which are brewed right there in the restaurant) and the beer was absolutely delicious. I had the Broken Hipster, which is a wheat beer, my fave. My husband had the Instigator and the Arrogant Bastard and loved both.   The food is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. The sandwiches are HUGE! We got the hummus and flatbread as an app, I got the BBQ duck pizza (delicious) and my husband got the eggplant sandwich. He's a vegetarian and there were a few very decent options for him (pizza, mac and cheese, or the eggplant Sammy).   Overall, not the place to go if you're looking for a cheap night out, but if you want to spend some cash on delicious beer and food in a cozy atmosphere with great service... highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After being here several times, I have to amend my previous review.  While service here is not exactly stellar, there  is too much to love otherwise. Here is what I find noteworthy...  1. This place (along with The Hole in the Wall across the street) has helped transform the Junction into a funky place that is fun to live in or worth visiting often. The neighbourhood is reviving thanks in part to this place. 2. They make beer here, and it is great. You can get a flight or stick with their recommendations. 3. They have a take-out station up front where you can pick up beer to go. 4. They don't rest. While they keep favourites on draught, there are new beer offerings all the time. 5. This place is a legit place to eat. You can order standard pub-type fare that is much better than standard pub-type fare. In addition to delicious burgers and wings, they have excellent pizzas and salads as well. The BBQ duck pizza is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The wings rock.  Finally, it is just a fun spot. They are not open super-late, so make Indie Ale House a starting or mid-point on your Junction night out."}
{"text":"This place has amazing beer, great food. It is really good place to meet friends   Food is good, but can get very busy and noisy at times."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Monday night to catch up with some friends. Very hipster decor with a good list of brew. Ordered the fried chicken and my wife had the duck pizza. The chicken blew me away. Crisp, tender and well flavored. Along with the ranch dip and the potato salad, I was in amazeballs country.  The pizza was also good. The pineapple mixed with duck was a good combo. I think they cooked down the pineapple first since I didn't find its sweetness to be over powering. Tried their Belgian wit and brown ale. Both were pretty good. The wheat beer is not so typical. It has a darker taste. It was a good night with good food and good company."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim because the restaurant we intended to go to was unavailable. It looks busy but we got a table right away. Atmosphere was good. Beer great. Food was excellent. Got the sampler of beers to see what I liked and then ordered a pint of my favourite. Will definitely be back to try some more beers and a couple of other on the menu that sounded and looked great."}
{"text":"OMG. What was I thinking ? bad food - bad drink- over priced- bad service for free (no tip)   I saw a crowded Pub like place, sat down, ordered the beer recommended, an IPA. I almost spit it across the room. The waiter at least changed that without hassle, the next beer, another one of theirs was disgusting. I couldn't drink it. Was bloating and had a really horrid flavor. And I have drank beer around the world. This was the worst.   Next the food came. OMG, the oil clearly is never changed, and dirty--this observation just based on how dark and unflavourful the fried item was, the burger tasted like horse meat.   The waiter never returned after he brought me the food, and I had to wait for cutlery..and go to the bar and wait to pay my bill. I should have just left no one would have noticed.   Basically for two days following eating there I felt very ill from the food (meat esp.).  I think health inspectors need to take a closer look at this faux pub.    I think a lot of people haven't had fine or very healthy good pub food. This is the bottom of Torontos proverbial barrel. Sure the design is there for the 'look' of trendy, but no one with taste should enter.   If you read other reviews further down..you will see many agree with me.  Me thinks, perhaps STAFF are posting reviews here....cuz many rebuttals come after the bad reviews.  Can somebody verify where their meat comes from, cuz it isn't quality beef."}
{"text":"Not allowed as a group to do cash and carry from the bar. Bar doesnt serve food past 12. Why would you come here past 12 with plus 6ppl if even 1 person wants to pay seperate. Trash. Experience food and drink reviewer. Weak sauce"}
{"text":"I don't live near the Junction and yet I find myself returning to the Indie Ale House at least a couple of times a year. The food is always much better than you'd expect, and the beer is, perhaps unsurprisingly, delicious.  This time around I opted to try the Short Rib \"Royale\" Burger (stout braised, shredded short ribs, quarter pound \"Indie blend\" patty, gruyere cheese, crispy onions, roasted garlic & thyme aioli).  It arrived pretty quickly and I happily dove in. I will admit I was turned off by the concoction's terrible bun-to-meat ratio, as I took three bites comprised solely of bread. (The toasted, buttered bread is delicious, at least.)  Once I got to the meat, however, I was very pleasantly surprised. The braised and shredded short ribs were tender and flavorful, while the assorted toppings complemented the burger perfectly. I can't say I noticed the \"quarter pound indie blend patty,\" though. Maybe they forgot to include it?  I also opted for a salad rather than fries. The kale-heavy salad is one of the few times I've been disappointed by something at the Indie Ale House, as it was just too plain and too uninspired to warrant any excitement.  I should also mention I sampled the Takes Two to Mango beer, which was indeed very mango-heavy (and very tasty)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the selection of their own beers, particularly the Barnyard. Forked River's Weendigo, one of their guest taps, was very popular at our table. It seems like their one-offs go quickly and they have a lot of turnover.  I wasn't crazy about the pumpkin sour, but this is likely because I generally don't enjoy sours or goses. We had hoped to try their carrot cake beer, but I was too slow. I heard it was nice. There are lots of great options.  Our server was very pleasant. He was flexible with our lactose-intolerant friend and deftly offered a tasty substitution for her burger. We shared the fried chicken plate which was enormous and delicious.   We visited on an evening which was not too busy, and we found the ambiance quite cozy. It's certainly a good place to bring a group.  I'm eager to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's always delicious. The craft beer, the food, the atmosphere, the service... thumbs up all around.   Everything here is super tasty. I especially liked the BBQ Mahogany Ribs, Tuna Tacos, BBQ Duck Pizza, Wings, and of course the beer flight with 5 samplers is worth a try.   They also have a little shop in the front where you can purchase their made-in-house beer, t-shirts, etc."}
{"text":"Went here when my family was in from out of town and was pleasantly surprised with the place.   Very good food ( table had the fried chicken and the burger as well as the brisket sandwich).  My nephew is a VERY picky eater and he was raving about his burger.   The staff are a bit snooty when it comes to the beer though. Not really helpful in helping my folks pick out something simple.   My Dad hated his beer and for the first time ever I witnessed him not finish a drink!  Not sure if they let you sample first...  Service is slow but the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Completely surprised by how delicious the food was here! Came with a group and we were all super impressed. I had the aubergine sandwich which was very tasty. I had the brownie for dessert which I didn't really care for. Way too rich and dense. Will definitely visit again though!"}
{"text":"A+. One of the best dining experiences I've had in the past year.   Incredible beer (all brewed in-house), amazing BBQ (Wednesdays only) and excellent service.   Pretty much as good as it gets for a brewpub. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the food!  Staff: Great staff, came by and checked on us often. There was a bit of confusion when paying the bill. I think some of the staff help each other out, but that means things can be overlooked in the shuffle. For example, when the whole table was paying, they took payment from one of our table (the rest had their cards and cash on the table) and then they walked away. Then someone else took the cash and another person took the remaining card payments. It was wasn't too bad, but it does show how it's a little disorganized.  Ambience: I love the feel for this place, however the seating can be a little crowded. We were a party of 5 and unfortunately, my friend who sat on the end of the table was getting bumped into quite a bit. I'd say that the table was more for 4 people but I understand how they wouldn't want to give us a table that's meant for 6 or more on a busy Friday night. Just needed more space between tables, because the table itself was fine for the five of us (there was enough room for all of our food). Also, it is very loud and very busy, so I suggest visiting on a weekday (they don't take reservations).  Food: I had the Atlantic Salmon Sandwich with a side of Crispy Kale Caesar. We also had Sweet Potato Fries to share with the table. The fries were fat, soft, and tasty. The crispiness of the kale really elevated the side salad for me and gave it that extra something. It was lightly dressed which is how I like it. The salmon sandwich had some smoked salmon as well as a large piece of seared salmon. It was so delicious and just melted in your mouth.  Although the ambience isn't perfect, I definitely love eating at this place."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer with nice rotating taps (even if several of their options are rather hoppy).  Pretty enjoyable food (I have definitely enjoyed their pizza and mac and cheese, but would skip the popcorn).  Knowledgable servers.  Fun atmosphere.  Overall, a great pub."}
{"text":"I second Mr. \"GET THE BURGER.\" I got the Bison & Belly Burger and HOLY SWEET JESUS. SO friggin good. Messy as hell because of how saucy and cheesy it was, but probably the best burger I've ever eaten. I got a side salad with it, which I didn't think I'd much care for, but even that was delicious.  Although I'm not a huge beer drinker, I had to try something here. Our server gave my friend and I a quick rundown of the beers on tap, and I went with what he recommended for me, which was great.  The place filled up really quickly soon after we got there, so service wasn't the most attentive, but the quality of the food and drinks more than made up for that. The bill for two of us (after tax and tip) was just over $60... I was expecting higher! I will definitely be back for that burger."}
{"text":"Love being able to see the brewery past the bar and shop in the take away store after we try the beers at dinner. The menu is very fatty but in a yummy way. Lots of pork belly, cheeses, fried stuff etc. My absolute favourite is the Bison & Belly burger. I have gotten it on the lettuce bun and it is quite a nice twist as it makes it crispy and refreshing but also a fatty kind of satisfying. A very interesting and delicious combination! I've tried all three of the salads and rather enjoyed all of them. The mussels are also yummy! Who would have ever thought to add bacon to mussels? Apparently Indie Ale House did. A little loud so don't expect to have an intimate experience as you will be raising your voice a little to carry it to your dining partner.  Recommend the beer float. Great way to test out the beers without a whole pint commitment to each!"}
{"text":"I literally dream about the black truffle popcorn! It's a must and I order it every time we come here. The broken hipster beer is really good. I also love their magic mushroom pizza. They are kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"I did an beer flight (5 beer sampler) here with all the IPAs they had on tap. Great choice. Though one thing i never got on my Toronto trip was how something tasting like a German Heffe Weizen fits in the IPA category? Regardless, the beer was great and the food was too."}
{"text":"Go for the beer selection, stay for the pub grub... I randomly picked this place out of a Yelp list when I was in the area. It's a busy place, even at 6pm on a weekday. The beer options are really good, they tend to rotate the selections on a frequent basis (from what I'm told).   I ordered the Bison & Belly burger and my dinner companion had the Atlantic salmon sandwich (which essentially, was a fish burger) and she really enjoyed it. I would recommend giving either of them a try...  I would most likely return if I ever find myself in that neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent burgers and fries chicken, can say it's one of the best fried chickens in toronto, portions are generous and they brew their own beer inside the restaurant, I believe customer can go and buy beer to go which is pretty neat, the IPA were a bit too bitter for my liking though but other than that it's a pretty hip place"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on a cold night for a bite and a beer.   I did not know what to expect but let me tell you it was quite a surprise.   Their menu is to the point but delicious. I had the short rib burger. Perfect seasoning and the flavor packed a bunch. Good dip also with the fries.   Now while the food is good they of course have an impressive list of delicious house brews which vary quite drastically. They also have one or two guest brews.   Their menu of food and beer seems to change from time to time, so one might wish to visit again and again.  Delicious!  Oh yes and you can buy their beer at a mini beer store at the entrance!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to place that never fails us.  We try to limit our frequency to keep it fresh especially when we aren't sure where else to go.  The beer selection is great and the food is consistent and tasty.  Service is excellent and we're never left to wait.  Environment is open and airy, industrial theme."}
{"text":"They were able to accomodate a group of ~25 (we notified them pretty last minute). Waitresses were attentive, food came at a decent pace. Very fitting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto at Keele & Dundas area. It was a a Wednesday nite so it wasn't jammed. Cheap parking just off Keele btw!  I order the Hot Italian Sausage Pizza with a delicious house made Broken Hipster beer. The Za was delicious. Just the right combo of dough, sauce & hot Italian Sausage. It was hot, crispy & fabulous!! All washed down by my Broken Hipster..a clean tasting lager. Our waiter \"Dustin\" was great. Her was patient, quick & attentive. Well done for him!   This is a definite do-over!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing....went there to celebrate our daughter's graduation from U of T. The staff are friendly and attentive. The food...INCREDIBLE!!! We had a wide variety of apps and entrees...everyone raved about everything and no one went away hungry. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wish they still did brunch, you won't get the best service ever, and far too many people bring babies (I have one, I just like my bars without the loud and crazy fam vibe)... But the beer is great. The food is legit. And this place was a big factor in the junction revival.   The inbound hipsters know the area for places like this, but it wasn't so long ago you couldn't pay people to live here. This place has a great vibe, awesome food (burger is apparently amazing, but as a veg I super recommend the mac and cheese or quinoa salad) and tasty craft beer selection, including take-home bottles.   As a pub bonus, the desserts are even pretty amazing (sticky toffee pudding on the top of the list fo'sho). They do need to bring back the cheddar and rosemary popcorn though... Why they messed with a great thing is beyond me :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast Porter Breakfast Porter Breakfast Porter   Ok now that is out of the way, the Indie Ale House has some super yummy beers ($12 for a taster flight of 5).  If you love craft beer this should be one place on your list to drop in. The selection is small (only 14 or so total) but add their amazing food menu and ambiance - and this is somewhere you can stay for the night.     The table had pork belly mac and cheese (super creamy!) and pork belly burgers.  Just enough to fill the void but not so big you feel overstuffed. If you prefer to nibble their charcouterie platter and cheese platters are great for sharing and everything is local grown and sourced.  If I lived in the area it would become a \"regular\" haunt, but as I dont, it will have to wait until the next time I make a special trip to the Junction!  P.S. They lost a star as they have  no beer to sell until January of next year.  Not sure what happened but hope they get back to bottling soon!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night at 930.  On the entance they told us food was no longer being served.   Drinks (3/5) We sat and orded a bunch of drinks: all of them were very unique and most of them had a fruity flavour.  Out of 13 drinks we tried 8 we would not order again ever,  3 were OK and 2 we liked.    Service: The waiter knew his beer and was friendly and entertaining.   We were asked to leave at 11.  Overall i was not impressed by the drinks and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're making a visit to the Junction neighborhood and love craft beer, then a visit to Indie Ale House should be on your list.   The brewery and gastropub have an impressive list of in-house taps including their well-known Broken Hipster (5%), India Pale Ale and of course, the Instigator (6.5%). If you're feeling a bit intimidated by the menu, or you just are unsure of what you want to order: the staff here are super impressive on their knowledge and can always help you narrow down your selection based on your preferred taste preference. I would recommend ordering a tasting flight ($10-$15) which offers up 5 beers of your choice served with 3oz samples.   OK, enough beer talk - let's get into the food! The kitchen offers everything from typical pub grub fare to some fancier (and lighter) options like Yellowfin Tuna Tacos ($15), Quinoa Salad ($14) or The Aubergine ($15). But really what you'll want to order is the fried chicken ($19). OMG, the fried chicken is transcendent, probably some of the best in the city. (Yep, that means you P.G. Clucks!)  Great community vibe, awesome food and best of all: amazing craft beers. I don't know what else you could ask for."}
{"text":"I made my latest visit to Indie last Sat. evening as the venue was the 4th stop on a Brewpub Crawl Event I was attending with a social Group.  8 of us arrived around 7:20 pm at which time it was packed.  We were told we'd have to wait awhile for a table for 8 but if we were willing to split up into 2 groups of 4 we could get tables almost immediately.  This we did and we were all seated shortly thereafter.  None of us at my table ordered food and I haven't eaten there on any of my previous visits so can't really comment on their menu, but their beer selection has always been quite admirable.  On this visit I ordered their Breakfast Porter, made with lots of oats and malted grains that give a smooth, coffee and chocolate character.  It was delicious, and despite the venue being packed, our service was fairly prompt and quite courteous.  I should note that the venue also offers beer flights of 5, which I have partaken in during at least a couple of previous visits.  Most times when I've visited it's been pretty crowded, a testament to the venue's popularity and quality."}
{"text":"Gord and I like craft beer and have been wanting to check out the Indie Ale House for a while.  We headed there for supper this evening.  They brew their own beer on site.  There is a store there so you can take home some beer, teeshirts, glasses, etc.  I had a couple Takes Two to Mango.  Gord was more adventurous and tried different ones.  Gord ordered Mac & Cheese with smoked pork hock, IPA and curds.  He said it was delicious and he'd get it again.  He scraped the bowl pretty clean.  There were lots of chunks of pork!  I ordered Southern Fried Chicken with fries.  The chicken was delicious!  It was so tender and moist.  And there was a lot of it!  I would soooooo get it again!  There was ranch and hot & honey mustard dipping sauces for the chicken.  The dipping sauce for the fries was a mayo/ketchup  It was quite busy when we left about 7ish.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I asked my friends to take me to a place where I can enjoy comfort food and also have some delicious beer to have because I knew I would need some form of comfort after writing one of the toughest exams I've had to write. They recommended indie ale house, vouching for the home brew drinks and amazing southern fried chicken.   Now let me tell you that my friends were right to keep coming to this location time and time again to get that chicken and drinks.....This place is amazing and easily a location I will be visiting time and time again and bringing others!   My friends had the southern fried chicken again, can't blame them. They let me have a bit of theirs and I almost cried  but I wanted to try something else in their menu. I got their wings and the BBQ duck pizza. The pizza was amazing but the habanero wings could've been better. Too dry and not spicy at all but I'm the type of person that is accustomed to spicy food so my tolerance is much higher. as for the drinks they have a nice selection to chose from and they are all brewed in house. There's also a mini store available to purchase their beers which we did.    I highly recommend this place. Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere and service!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and planning to visit again!  The food here is fantastic no complaints.  However the service friday night being extremely busy the service was dreadfully slow.  We went for dinner again during a week night and the service was much quicker. Root beer is really good."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection.. First time to the junction and was very happy with our choice of bar..  Cool vibe, busy, great beer selection and the waiter was knowledgeable and pretty jokes.. overall great time!"}
{"text":"The Southern Fried Chicken is legit amazing.   Tender. Juicy. Get. In. And. Around. My. Mouth.   They lose a star for the automated 28% gratitude fee for groups more than 5."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price.  The burger was delicious and I'm excited to come back and have the chicken! They had a pumpkin ale on special when we were in (a while ago) and as someone who doesn't really like pumpkin flavoured anything, it was amazing."}
{"text":"With their on-site brewery, their ale is as fresh as it gets! I recommend this for the micro-brewery snobs out there for sure. In terms of the menu, it is a bit limited but the items were tasty. We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer. It came with a tasty spring green type salad. I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. It was slightly spicy, very yummy. My hubby raved about the Cheese burger. The only issue was that they do not have sliced onions, which according to my who is a hamburger connoisseur , must come with sliced onions! He asked for onions and they gave him diced onions. Boo!"}
{"text":"I usually spend between 10-15 on a meal..I like my cheap and delicious food! So when I spend 30 dollars and I do it willingly and gladly, EVERYONE KNOWS that wherever I am eating is sensational. India Ale House was absolutely sensational and worth the $30 that I spent on my magnificent meal. This incredible restaurant takes excellent to a whole new level.   I ordered the BISON & BELLY BURGER and it was so good.  It was so great that they had gluten free options (THANK YOU FOR THAT). I had this delicious meat wrapped in lettuce and it was the most delicious burger I have ever had in my entire existence. Every bite mattered and I never wanted it to end. The french fries were spectacular as well.   Amazing service, great vibe, good food....this place is a GEM! India Ale is a MUST DO, MUST SEE! If you are wondering about weather or not to go..don't think about it..JUST DO IT! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went there for drinks, tried about 6 different brews among the 4 of us, and was impressed with all of them. The atmosphere is nice and the server was great and very helpful and friendly.  It's in the neighborhood so we will definitely be going a lot!   The beer may have given a hangover (craft beer tends to do that sometimes, esp. good ones!) but was worth it"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, we had chicken wings, pizza, ribs, and mussels.  The sauce on the wings were too spicy, I couldn't taste the chicken. The pizza was decent. The ribs were smoky and flaky, one of the more memorable dishes.  The mussels were a bit sandy and not too fresh, the flavor was ok. The restaurant is big and nicely decorated, the staff is friendly, no split bills allowed, food portion is decent but the menu is a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Great food and beer!  The wait staff are very knowledgeable and were helpful in helping select a brew."}
{"text":"I hope you stay here FOREVER Indie Ale House because you're the definition of a perfect neighbourhood bar!   Seriously though. I can't think of one negative thing to say about this place! I've been here countless times (although I always forget to check-in on Yelp ... oops!). I've also introduced many friends to this place and they all love it as much as I do.   I was never a huge beer drinker, but Indie Ale House has converted me - they have such a great selection of unique beers and they let you sample them before you buy!   My favourite beer I've ever tried was called Island Escape and they also have a sour raspberry beer that is delicious- there is always something new, so it's an amazing place to mix it up and try something you normally wouldn't.   The bartenders and servers are all so friendly and never make you feel rushed. The bar has such a comfy, relaxed, small town in a big city kind of vibe.   Needless to say, Indie Ale House is one of my favourite bars and I will continue to share my love of this place with others :) Try it out!"}
{"text":"Finally, a brew pub close to home!  We had been anticipating the opening the Indie Ale House for well over a year.  We would dutifully drive by on a weekly basis to see if it was open yet.   Our first outing here was on a Thursday night for an early dinner.  We had the Shrimp Po' Boys ($15) and the Ale House Burger ($13) both with fries on the side.  The ketchup that came with my fries was house made but tasted more like a marinara sauce.  We tried a few beer selections from the menu.  Beer prices ranged from $6.50 to $10, depending on alcohol content.  Service was friendly and quick.   We did a second outing a few weeks later on a Friday night.  Wow, the place was packed!  Luckily our friends arrived a bit early and snagged a table.  Food orders this time was the popcorn ($3), Junction Pie pizza ($15), Mac&Cheese ($13), burger with brisket ($15) and the Shrimp Tacos ($15).  Food arrived pretty quickly despite the busy dining area.  We tried the beer sampler this time which gave 5 choices from the menu - pricing started at $10 with an additional $1 for the more potent beers.  There was a bit of a wait for our final bill as our waitress was tending to multiple tables but we still found service to be helpful and friendly.  The Indie Ale House is definitely a welcome to the neighbourhood and from the looks of the filled tables, it won't be going away anytime soon.  Thank god, because it's within stumbling distance from my house!"}
{"text":"I had never been to the Indie Alehouse but have heard good things.  When 2 friends and I planned to meet for an early dinner I looked around and settled on this spot.  All 3 of us are in the food industry and generally super picky about food quality ambience service pricing.    This was an excellent choice! Great space amazing food and drink and exemplary service.    I had the duck pizza and roasted kale Caesar and loved every bite.  The pizza crust must be made in house.  Thing crispy salty crunch.  So good.  Salad was a very good portion  and was shared by 2.  My friend P got the special brisket burger which he said was delicious  (and it looked it, large thick slice of melt in your mouth brisket.  My friend G also had a pizza which he loved too.   Excellent service from Nick and the  Dustin.  Will definitely recommend and look forward to my next visit.    Only suggestion  is that the Ladies bathroom is pretty dirty.  Grout walls etc need a good clean."}
{"text":"Southern fried chicken is a bomb!!! Really really good! You won't even regret it!! I personally like the breakfast porter and instigator. Good price of range and nice place to hangout with your friends or family.  Will definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry but starving, they were so accommodating to me. They have literally the most best popcorn ! Really great place!!!"}
{"text":"I was there last night. I had a flight of beer a d a burger.  The staff was friendly and knowledgable and the food was tasty.    It would be nice if there were a few lighter options on the menu....but I suppose you don't go to a brew pub if you are counting calories....the popcorn is a must try"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since it opened. Visiting usually once a week because it's generally very consistently good and I'm a huge fan of their beer and food. Read the other reviews for opinions on that.  I knew the house managers here and they were fantastic. There's been some turnover and they're gone and unfortunately, the service has suffered. The regular service staff here is generally fantastic but there's been several times where we've been greeted at the door by some very rude people. Not giving us a choice of where to sit, forcing us to seat somewhere we don't want to even when we say we'll wait for another table, then being very rude about it, rolling eyes, etc.. It's really hard to take when I've spent thousands of dollars here over the years, I am always polite and clear about what I want and that I don't mind waiting.   The other change they've made is they've shrunk their beer glasses and increased their beer prices. I really don't care about paying more for beer, I get it, costs go up. But not offering a real pint in an alehouse is inexcusable. There is no 20oz glass. You'll get a 16oz shaker pint and that's it. Want a 3.5% cask bitter? 16oz shaker glass. I really don't get that. The owner is supposedly so anal about the beer and how it is served yet he won't serve a real pint?  I've also noticed they seem to be cramming more tables inside. It's gotten pretty ridiculous, to the point where now in many places you can't even walk between tables, the service staff can't even get to your plates. I know you want to cram as many paying customers in there as possible, but you need to stop when it's affecting people's experience and service.  Anyway, all this is to say, it's a great neighbourhood joint, but getting greedy is no way to keep your regulars."}
{"text":"I am going on record as stating this place has one of the top three burgers in Toronto. And that is high praise, with new places popping up daily in TO. It's greasy in the best way - sauce mixed with the toppings is a home run. You can get it with any of their great salads too I love the beet and goat cheese. The place loses a star for slow service from time to time - but I keep going back for that burger!!"}
{"text":"Visited Indie Ale House on Friday, March 5th around 6:00 PM for dinner and was promptly told that it would be over an hour wait and looking around it was easy to understand considering it was rammed.  30 minutes later we were texted and told the table for the six of our group was ready.  Fried chicken, bison burgers and spring rolls were ordered along with every single beer on their tap list. Everything came quickly and well prepared.  Our group spend at least 2 hours here eating, drinking and having a fantastic time. Make a point to visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Amazing gem in the Junction! Brews own beers, with rotating taps, and has a fulfilling menu options. Had the Cockpuncher and the Broken Hipster. Many seasonals also available, ask the waiter! Accessible after a few minutes walk from Downsview subway station. A little away from downtown and no patio available, but will definitely do a detour next time for the great variety of beers offered. Friendly staff, family friendly establishment while retaining its fun filled atmosphere."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have been here many times. The ales are very good but very strong so lightweight drinkers should beware. The Instigator is always a good choice. The food is fairly good across the menu with the maple smoked wings my fave. Service ? Not the best. In the  USA barstaff generally try to make your visit enjoyable. Here the staff are \"just doing my job\" style. Blank stares rather than a welcoming smile mostly."}
{"text":"I don't know why my Yelp friend spent so much time to decide which of the 5 beers to be included in the $13 Beer Flight at Indie Ale House!  I wanted to screamed just ordered them all!! But I was not thinking straight after having beer sampling at Junction Craft Brewing earlier.....  Ended up we ordered 2 sample trays anyway... what we had is not really relevant since quite a few of their offerings are seasonal but we did enjoy:  Barnyard Rye IPA Zombie Apocalypse Imperial Stout Instigator IPA - One of their Flagship Jump The Shark Glory and Consequences Breakfast Porter St Crispin's Mild - Light and Crisp with no aftertaste... 3.5% drinks like a light beer! Cockpuncher IPA - @100 IBU and 11%!!! and love the bad ass name!! Witner Toquie  We also shared Butter squash Samosa and Pulled Pork Spring Roll which were both great as snack as we drank our beers!  Love the set up!! It is one of the best brewpub I been to in Toronto that serves decent food and will a beer hall like setting! Service was excellent as our server patiently help us select our drinks!  The Junction Neighbourhood is so lucky to have Indie Ale House!! I definitely will be back for some more sampling next time when I am in the neighbourhood!  Just give me everything on the beer menu!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer. Yummy food. Insane bacon popcorn. Seemed good for families in the early evening."}
{"text":"Really great selection of beer. The vibe in there is really nice too, love going there on weekends. The servers are very knowledgable and helpful, I always trust their recommendations. Definitely recommend doing the taster flights. Never tried their food though, but I am sure its good. Best bar in the Junction."}
{"text":"Huge space (you can always get a table), super-laid-back vibe, burgers are awesome, fried chicken is crispy-fantastic-juicy-poultry-heaven and kids are welcome.  The beers are mostly pretty hoppy (in my household we are divided on whether that is a plus or minus)."}
{"text":"Since my last review i've frequented the India ale house maybe 5-6 times, sometimes with friends, or sometimes with my SO, and i don't know what it is, but i feel like it gets a bit worse with each visit.  We went there last night, it was only about 40% full on a Thursday night. Our party of 4 stood at the door for about 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. There were 2 open booths, and several open tables for 4-6, we asked to sit in a booth, and the waitress tells us she wants to keep them open for groups of 6. Ok fine, you want to cram as many ppl in as possible. 15 minutes after the booth is filled by 2 women who had the booth for pretty much the entire time we were there. Also, a table of two was beside us, seated at a table for two despite all the tables, and they had so much food and drink that  the waitress couldn't even put down the mussels, pizza, etc. Talk about making the customer feel uncomfortable when they are spending money at the restaurant. we ordered flights and they also ran out of beers for the flights, i wanted an extra small glass of whatever beer and they didn't have anymore. Things happen, but the waitress we had yesterday was dreadful. Totally not helpful, not attentive and just miserable. We weren't impressed with the service last night at all, we intended to order food but did not want to have to deal with our waitress. We had three flights and our guests from out of town also weren't that impressed with about half the beers.  The time prior to last night we went as a group of 4 again, and the food just wasn't very good. The mushroom mac and cheese was still awesome so that's why this place still gets 3 stars in my book, but we got the pulled pork poutine and duck pizza which were not good. the pulled pork poutine was served on cold fries, too little sauce, the meat was dry and did not seem fresh. The duck pizza was bland and flavourless to the point where my friend had to dip it into hot sauce to swallow it. the indie ale house did not impress that night.  I will continue to return for the mac and cheese but i probably won't be getting anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Great staff, tasty beers (the best porter I have found in Toronto!), and I liked the moules et frites.  I shall return."}
{"text":"Oh Indie Ale house how I love thee!! Seriously amazing food, amazing service and good beer! Don't let the name fool you..its really a quality food place the beer is sitting side car here!  If you are lucky enough to to hit the Indie Ale house on a Friday when they have the Beef Brisket sandwich special... GET IT! Drool factor 10! So so good! All the food is incredible and they have had their fair share of magazine nods from Toronto Life. (Not that I think many of the writers/critics have any real good foundation of food knowledge). But hey it is a tip of the hat to Indie!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star because of how rude and disrespectful the owner/manager Jason Fisher is.  I have attached the nasty email he sent to me in regards to emailing about an event sponsorship. As my boss called to complain, a nice woman explained that they have done in-kind donations and sponsorships. I wouldn't do business with this place if it was the last place on earth."}
{"text":"Always changing up their beers which are brewed on site.  By always, I mean always.  Each time something new is on offer.   Some are wickedly strong (such as cockpuncher) and many are seasonal appearing only briefly.  It's fun to get a flight of different offerings to match whatever they happen to have on tap.  The food is decent but you come for the beer."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Indie Ale House in the Junction, and it was as good as I remember. Relaxed vibe and constantly changing beer list. This time seemed mostly focused on IPAs and barrel-aged beers. We had both popcorn snacks (cinnamon sugar and sriracha butter) and both were top notch. Also, this place has one of my all time favorite mac&cheese dishes, so fantastic."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, get the southern fried chicken, and be hungry when you do.  The meal was amazing. The chicken was perfect, the potato salad was a bit creamy for my liking, but I don't mind in the long run it was fabulous.   The chicken was flavourful, juicy and the dipping sauces were phenomenal.   I had the guest tap the Muskoka Detour and it was really great. Had I not been out and about all day and quite tired when I got there, I would have tried a flight.  The decor is great, good location, great vibe, the only complaint I really had was staff. Our service was slow and multiple times she forgot my friend's drink. But apart from that, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love their food.  I have had the mac and cheese and the tiny tuna tacos and both were amazing!  The charcuterie board is a great deal with lots of options. Their portions are huge and usually have leftovers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this large microbrewery (pardon the oxymoron).   The pub part is huge, with big wooden booths and massive menus. I can't speak to their food treats, but the burgers and fries passing our table looked and smelled delicious. Naturally, their beers are flowing and rotating regularly, but they also have old time-y sodas for folks on the wagon. Beyond this, their bottle shop of growlers is open at weird times and on holidays.   Thank you, Indie Ale House, you saved Canada Day."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for the longest time. Up until a few years ago, I thought the Junction was just too far! But now that I work by the Junction, I love exploring it!  Finally, I came with a friend to Indie post-work and IT WAS BEER HEAVEN. They have the option of ordering a flight... which is my favorite because I love to sample as many new beers as possible! Also the menu looked great and the food all looked good. But I was in a drinks mood.   Really chill atmosphere and friendly staff. i cannot wait to come back both to dine in or just pick up some bottles!   So. Much. Yum."}
{"text":"The beer selection is probably better than I've ever seen it but I wasn't impressed with the service. It was slow and a bit begrudging... our first two rounds took 20ish minutes each and our last when I asked about timing was quick but she slammed them onto the table and walked away without looking at us.... uncalled for."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Have been a few times with friends and family. Always well done and fresh. A real crowd pleaser.   Recommended food: Mac and cheese (squash is my go to) and Rosemary  popcorn.  fantastic beer selection.  yum!"}
{"text":"Tasty unique beers, a fantastic venue and a thriving atmosphere bustling with local drinkers."}
