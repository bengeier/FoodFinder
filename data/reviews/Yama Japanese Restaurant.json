{"text":"Teeny mom-and-pop kind of place. Just one sushi chef, just one waitress. I go in about once a week and I'm never disappointed. Great deal on the lunch special, though oddly it's never quite as tasty as the dinners, which are the best I've had in Toronto (granted, I haven't eaten at any of the high-end sushi places here).   Definitely the best sushi in Bloor West Village. I've lived in the neighborhood for over a year and tried them all!"}
{"text":"Been going to Yama for years. Small, quiet and refined. food carefully prepared and nicely served. The food is good, the sushi especially nice. Tired of bigger places full of noisy people? Go to Yama and enjoy a quiet civilized lunch or dinner. Udon is tasty too, also the tempura. Avoid the gyoza, they are not what you get in Japan."}
{"text":"i would rate this a 3.5  Cute little place in bloor west village. Fresh sushi!   Spicy Tuna roll - generous size and great fresh tuna. Nice touch with spicy sauce at the top  Diablo role - a funky gooey baked mess and so delicious! Lots and lots of crab meat and shrimp tempura rolls - lots of other things but cant really tell what exactly there was :)  Sushi pizza - generous toppings of fresh salmon, cucumber - delicious! not too crazy about the crust though.   Great neighbourhood sushi place!"}
{"text":"A nice small restaurant with great food.   I often get the Sashimi Dinner. It comes with Miso Soup & Salad too. The sashimi won't disappoint and there's a lot of it too.   Other that I've been there with loved it!  I've been back many times and would definitely go there again.   It's great for take out too!"}
{"text":"I really disagree with the reviews of this place. The service was friendly, but I paid my 30$ bill with a $50 and got all loonies & quarters back. Which was frustrating, so I left a $6 quarter tip. I ordered take out, three types of rolls & seaweed salad. It took 40mins of me waiting to get the order. It wasn't even busy, two tables were also eating at that time. By the time I finally got home & opened my order there was no seaweed salad, the one thing I was craving. And one of the rolls was gigantic. It could have been used as a coaster & actually hurt my jaw to eat. The supposedly good spicy salmon rolls were slimy. And I was actually worried to eat them, I didn't need to be hugging a toilet in an hour. The coaster sized rolls were wrapped in salmon and it wasn't fresh either. I sat up at the counter, they took pre cut slices out of a container and didn't cut from  the nice fresh piece of salmon in the mini counter fridge. Terrible. I got a spider roll, which isn't a favorite of mine, but it was the best one. They deep fried it to order, the only good thing they did do. So there was no fishiness there.  So overall, SO disappointed!! I was going to bring a friend there, and I will not recommend this place to anyone. In a city that has tons of sushi joints on more main roads, they really need to pick up their game."}
{"text":"After my terrible experience at Toshi recently, I did not get my sushi fix and so wanted to try this up and coming place which is probably the closest sushi join to my house. I am SO glad I did.  Though it doesnt look like much from outside then atmosphere is quaint and relaxing; I feel like I could spend hours there.  The service was friendly and competent. She checked in with me to make sure if I liked everything and even offered to fill my green tea at the end after I'd just paid, a gesture I very much appreciated.  The sushi itself was delicious. Best crunchy noodle soup I've ever had. My $13 lunch bento box came with that, miso soup, green salad, sushi, spicy salmon roll, tempura veg and shrimp, dumplings, and this delicious amuse bouche type thing that I have no idea what it is. Great value and all delicious!  Presentation of everything was spot on. Even the miso soup (which was the one thing I didn't particularly love) was garnished better than most I've had.  This place will now be competing with Sushi House for my business but due to its location, they have an edge. I hope it stays consistently this awesome!"}
{"text":"Okay, I think I visited this restaurant 3 times in one week so I have to change my review.  I love, love, love the spicy salmon. I couldn't stop thinking about it or eating it hahaha. The server is so friendly and recognized me the second time I visited. She is an extremely nice lady and so is the gentleman that works there as well.  The prices are pretty fair. $8-9 for an 8 piece large spicy salmon roll. I'll take it.  This has quickly become one of my favourite non-AYCE Japanese restaurants in Brampton. I suggest you give it a try. I will probably never have sushi from Ocean's again. This place is also open until 10:30 which I really like and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Solid sushi.  Really liked the tempura. Service was good. Drink selection was limited."}
{"text":"3.5*  I thought this place was pretty good, but I wouldn't drive out of the way for it.  We ordered Yama Sushi (18 pieces - $17.95) and a Hwe Dup Bob ($12.95) to-share.  Sushi platter came with a good variety of different kinds of fish, not all-salmon like a lot of places.  The tuna was a bit fishy, but soft, edible.  Everything was fairly fresh, but not completely melt-in-your-mouth.  Minor, weird observation:  I could've done without the fake flower that was on top of the parsley garnish on the Yama Sushi plate.  I stayed away from it, but it's probably recycled and I'm not sure if they wash it in-between servings.    The Spicy Salmon maki roll came with the spicy sauce/crunch ON TOP of the roll and I would've preferred if it was mixed into the roll.  I like my spiciness all over!  ;)  The flavour was good though.  Hwe Dup Bop was good value with approx. 6 small rice bowl-sized servings in 1!  There was at least 3 different kinds of tobiko in this dish, good presentation.  My only complaint about this salad + diced sashimi + rice was that it NEEDED a larger serving bowl.  I added my rice and it was quite difficult to mix everything together.  Pieces of the salad even came out of the bowl.  Dinner came with a crunch soup (in a cute tea cup) + fresh salad with a sesame flavoured vinegarette (much too acidic at the bottom) + miso soup + green tea ice cream at the end.  Good added value!  Atmosphere:  Could've used a surround sound.  I heard a radio faintly in the background, otherwise, it was a large group full of gamer-type uni students and their convo.  Only 1 other table during a Friday dinner service, so quiet."}
{"text":"Being from Vancouver, home of almost as many sushi restaurants per capita as there are Starbucks, I am always looking for a decent sushi restaurant. By decent, I mean more of a sushi cafe vs fine-dining - A place where you can go on a regular basis.  Since relocating to the Roncesvalles/High Park area, I have been pleasantly surprised to find several solid places, that have above-average food and great, friendly (and kid-friendly) staff.   Yama in Bloor West Village is no exception. This is a tiny place with seemingly only one server but again, the service is great (in that Japanese-restaurant kind of way). They serve the usual fare for this style of restaurant sushi, sashimi, maki, donburi, tempura, teriyaki etc, pus what seems to be a staple, at least in this neighbourhood: special rolls.  Everything I have tried there so far has been above average, with the exceptions of the salmon teriyaki, which I found to be exceptionally tender with just the right amount of sauce - some of the better I have had. And the sashimi which was sliced and prepared with just a little more care and delicacy than I would normally expect from a restaurant of this type.  All in all, a satisfying little place. Next, to try Yumi Sushi, a few doors down..."}
{"text":"ya ma, let's go to Yama Sushi!    I heard about this place through word of mouth and ended up coming here with my gf and her family. . .  and I'm glad we chose this place! It is relatively new and the inside gives off a traditional Japanese feel which is nice. As soon as we got there, we were sat at a booth that seemed like a four person booth, but then they magically removed one of the barriers next to us and transformed the booth into an 8 person booth. So the fact that they can continuously adjust the booth sizes means happy seating arrangements for everyone.   While we were waiting for our Sushi, we were served crunchy noodle soup and a small side salad as appetizers, and we were given complimentary spicy salmon handrolls which were perhaps the most delicious handrolls we've ever tried. Half our party doesn't even like handrolls, but they loved these ones! We had to wait a little for our main course to come but it was definitely worth the wait. We got the Love Boat--not sure if that's what it's actually called but it's a boat filled with Sushi rolls and Sashimi. Both the rolls and Sashimi were super fresh and delicious. Writing about them is really making me want to go back right now. . .   As a new Sushi restaurant in Brampton, I definitely recommend this place. I know I will be back in the near future."}
