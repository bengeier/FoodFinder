{"text":"Right in between Seaboard Taproom and Cigars 105 in the heart of Downtown Matthews in a small building, from what I was told is the the old phone exchange or switchboard.  They've got excellent pizza a couple of wraps, salads, and quesadillas.  I've only had the pizza and it was perfect.   Great addition to Matthews!"}
{"text":"Great place to get Pizza downtown Matthews. Started eating when I was out at Seaboard getting a drink. After seeing that they deliver I expanded my Pizza Depot dinners to all over Matthews. Now, when Im in the mood for pizza I go to Depot as I think its better than the new Pizza Peel and Mod Pizza in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza joint in Matthews! Quick pizza. All the toppings you want. Good choice of toppings. Great crust. This is a place you want to make it to!"}
{"text":"I read the other four reviews and decided to try this place. This is the short version. They only offer one size, which is a large which sadly is more like a small medium.  I was pretty unimpressed with both the cheese and the pepperoni pizzas i ordered. Crust was super thick and doughy and the sauce too salty. On top of it they are way over priced. I would not waste my time. If you want special pizza go elsewhere and if you want ordinary pizza well there are plenty of options for ordinary pizza in Charlotte for much much less! Save your money."}
{"text":"Very fresh flavor. Loved the Harvest Vegetable. The Wild Mushroom pizza was amazing. Great addition to Matthews. Great to have the Seaboard Taproom right next door. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Hands down ..... the best natural pizza in the Matthews - South Charlotte area!  All ingredients and herbs are fresh.  Pizzas are made to order quickly!   The Exchange Pizza Depot make delicious and satisfying pies.  Nice people - nice pizzas."}
{"text":"Brendan made me an amazing wild mushroom w/ truffle oil AND CRISPY BACON today. Now it's time to sit on my couch, watch a movie and enjoy this Friday afternoon. Premium cheese, great mushroom mix and HOW DOES HE GET THE BACON SO PERFECTLY CRISPY?! Best pizza in town! Friendly folks. The best!  Don't hesitate. Go as soon as you can! Kathy"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious pizza! Great price (yep- only 1 price no matter what you get), lots of topping choices (build your own & preset specials too), nice team making the magic happen.  Cute little brick building just behind/beside Seaboard. Takeout only... but that's kind of perfect because it goes great with Seaboard beer too!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there several times now.  The pizza is fabulous with dough and sauces made on site.  The toppings are all fresh and delicious.  There are several \"regular\" pizzas on the menu but you can change it up to suit yourself.  They also offer wraps, salads and sandwiches. (Love the grilled cheese and the quesadillas).  You owe to yourself to check it out if you are in Matthews."}
{"text":"This little spot is located on the outside patio/deck for Seaboard. You can sit inside Seaboard, or outside on the deck. Its a takeout only, but being co-located with Seaboard means you still have seating. I got the veggie pizza, with sausage on it. It was very good. A beer from Seaboard brewing, with a Pizza from here, and sit outside on a picnic table in good weather, made for a great afternoon."}
