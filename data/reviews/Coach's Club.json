{"text":"I really want to like this place with every visit but always walk away disappointed. Their food and service is nothing special. Going out for a family dinner is a treat for us. I'd select another establishment over Coach's. The outdoor seating is nice, though. Maybe the next time will wow me! I continue to hope."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Food is inconsistent. Go here hoping it will improve but never does. Pricier than Madison to drink."}
{"text":"Choaches club is  a decent place.  Went there with a group of friends to include kids.  They gave us their hole up stiars meeting area with was nice with kids, but i never saw another customer in the dinnign area, only a few prople in the bar.  We started with the Chips and Salsa, was great.  My daughter orders the kdis spagettit, but they were out of kids sauce, later I was informed that the kids sauce didnt have meat, but they had (adult Spagetti) meat sauce.  I ordered a hail mary pizzas which was a 3 meat pizza, that was burnt on the bottom.   Service was slow and instead of filling out water glasses the waiter brought us two pictures of water.  Others in my party seemed happy with their food, but nobody was over joyed.  A place like this needs to get on the ball with dinner service, patrons at the bar said they sat there cause they could get service and food faster then in the dinning area."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would classify this tavern as a \"steak house'', but it is very good.  This was our second visit and we were not disappointed.   The food was fresh, served hot and....surprise of surprises...the burger I ordered medium rare was actually served medium rare!!!!! ( Virtually unheard of these days.)  My wife had the fish sandwich and very selfishly refused to share.  We did share an order of Buffalo Wings which were also very tasty even though I thought they could use a little more spice, but  that's probably just me.  The French Onion Soup was surprisingly good.       Portions are certainly large enough, the service is efficient and friendly and the pricing is fair.  Overall Coach's seems to be a very good value.  Chances are they will be seeing a bit more of us in the future."}
{"text":"Our ever-reliable hometown restaurant.  Burgers, fries, kids' plates, wraps are excellent.  They make a really good club sandwich!  Nothing fancy but a comfortable environment for couples, families and friends going out.  Our mainstay.  I'm giving it four stars because it simply isn't 5 star food.  But very acceptable midwestern \"diner\" fare.   Enjoy and bottoms up"}
{"text":"Had the Prime Rib special on a Thursday night MISTAKE! Sent it back got another one that was the same. Hard to chew and over cooked. Very disapointing considering the restoration job they have done to the place. Apparently they didnt spend it on hiring kitchen help. Menu is over priced but thats just my opinion. Go to Monks right next door, the place isnt fancy but the food is second to none and prices are very right!"}
{"text":"When we first moved to cross plains I felt like this place was good, Lately coaches has gone down hill. The food doesn't taste as good as it used. I will drive into Middleton to get food instead of eating here."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and food here. I had the pulled pork, the others ordered the special for the night, a burger with gyro meat on it and the other person ordered another hamburger speciality as well. We also ordered the pizza fries, which is pizza dough with cheese and garlic. I loved the crust. If I come here again I'd like to try the lobster mac and cheese or a pizza. Great place in a small town and I thought prices were priced right."}
{"text":"We've gone here a handful of times and always enjoyed our meal thoroughly. The French fries are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to eat and drink. Been there with groups of two to 15 and have had very good experiences.   Burgers are good, wings are good, pizzas are quite good. Have not had a bad meal, but nothing exceptional.   Beer selection is a mix of standard bar fair (Miller light, bud light) and some solid micro brews from Lake Louis, Carbon four, Ale asylum and small breweries like New Glaris and Dechutes The burgers of the month have been interesting.  Fish fry is average   We've been there for a couple of bands and have had a good time. Worth dropping in"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had Fish Fry there last friday. I was thrilled to find we got the last two-top, before they were on a wait. We have been here before, for their opening night, and the service has improved significantly since we were last there. The fish fry was o.k., I would say I've had better, but It wasn't bad. Our food came out fast, but we didn't receive the three cheese bread, as the menu states all fish fry's come with. I did ask the waitress and she claimed there is no bread offered with fish fry's. Later, at home I checked the menu and it clearly states that all fish fry's come with bread. The waitress did tell us they are currently in the process of changing their menu and adding some more pizzas. Overall, the food was a 3 star, service 4 star, atmosphere 5 star. Maybe we will give it another shot after they change up their menu."}
{"text":"My in-laws live in Cross Plains, so this is a staple when we come to visit. Sunday morning brunch at Coach's is the place to be! I really enjoy their biscuits and gravy. They also have a great bar area, as well as an upstairs for parties."}
{"text":"I went here last week to try it out. The restaraunt is very nice, and the outdoor dining is even nicer in my opinion. The burger prices where ordinary for these types of restaraunts. $6-$10ish. The burger I ordered was good, but nothing amazing. My moms was great though. There was a slow down in the kitchen when we went, they gave everyone deep fried pickles (which were really good) for free because of this. Also the waitor made a little mistake, but it was no big deal because we were in no rush, and were enjoying the place. Our waitor even bought us a slice of pie for being slow, that was nice. And that slice of pie was amazing."}
{"text":"So this place is just ok. Nothing really special. We came for lunch. The chicken pesto - the pasta was overcooked. The buffalo chicken sandwich - definitely was not smothered in buffalo sauce like the menu stated. The French dip - where were the onions and green peppers ? The French fries were pretty tasty. The prices are pretty reasonable. The service was just ok. I wouldn't ever need to make a trip back here."}
{"text":"THE CHEESE CURDS!!! Made in the morning, served fresh and squeaky to you. They're SO effing good.  I'm a huge bloody fan, and though these are basic, they're pretty good!  Choose from regular, cucumber or jalapeno vodka to spice it up. And speaking of which, I asked for spicy and they DELIVERED.  I've been here 3 times now, and the wait staff have been lovely every time. The bathrooms are clean, there's a private lot, and the atmosphere is small-town cool.  The only thing that I think needs improvement are the burgers. The toppings are great - it's the burgers themselves. I think they're literally just hamburger meat. No diced onion or secret spice. Just frozen and thawed plain ground meat - and it's not very tasty.  Next time I will try the nachos and get the 1/2 order: a woman nearby ordered that and it looked insanely good (she confirmed) and GINORMOUS. Seriously, just the 1/2 order could feed two.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood, but you don't need to drive all the way here as your main destination."}
{"text":"We have tried Coaches multiple times when near Cross Plains and each time I leave irritated.  The only thing consistent is the slow service.    This morning we attempted breakfast for the first time.  Not the way to start your Sunday morning. It took a half hour for a couple of omelets and when we finally received food between the two plates we could almost make one decent meal.  My husbands omelet was good but mine was under down and was accompanied by a soggy cold English muffin.  The breakfast potatoes on my plate were good but my husbands were raw.  The staff was apologetic and we received a discount and a couple drink chips.  I think this place is lucky Cross Plains has little to offer when it comes to food!  You might want to take the extra 10 minutes and drive to Middleton."}
{"text":"We were there last night with a group of bicyclists. They were alerted ahead of time that a group of about 20 was coming. We were among the last to arrive. The single waitress serving the group would disappear inside for endless stretches of time, and each time she came out with some drinks or food, we were ignored. I asked for a menu, but she never brought one. The place wasn't busy; we were about the only group there, due to road construction. Finally after about a half hour we left without ordering. I have been there in past years under similar situations, and my recollection is that the service was never very good. This time, it didn't come close to acceptable. Unfortunately, options in Cross Plains are few."}
{"text":"Had the special. Jerked turkey, sugared bacon, and some other stuff on a really tasty bun. All entres come with waffle fries covered with Parmesan cheese. It was clean, well decorated, has bar, dining and patio seating. It wasn't very busy but the waitress 'Joy', was attentive and gave excellent service. Parking is slim and the prices are higher than I like to pay for lunch."}
{"text":"We've been here 5+ times now and each time I leave slightly unsatisfied.The service has always been quick and the food comes out very fast. The cheese curds are definitely the best thing I've had there. While everytime I order a burger I end up regretting it. Not that they are bad, they just feel like they are pretty plain jane when it comes to seasonings in the meat. They advertise that the burgers are made with local meat yet I feel like its a missed opportunity with how the meat is prepared. Also when we've ordered medium rare is usually comes out done, with very little if any pink. Overall I like coming here, it has a nice relaxed vibe and its definitely a place you could go to hang out and have a couple of beers while watching a football game. However I think some of their recipes could use a little twist or enhancement and it would take this place to being one of the best in the area."}
{"text":"Solid four stars.  We've eaten here three times, each time with our small kids (ages 1 and 3).  Food is good and consistent, beer is cold, service is efficient and friendly.    Value is pretty good.  Kids eat free on Sundays (and get a nice dinner with ice cream).  I had the cap steak sandwich last time and it was honestly the best steak sandwich I have ever had.    We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We have lived in the Cross Plains area the past few years and this has become One of our favorite restaurants.  Great food, drinks and service.  We love the pizza, wings and pretzel bites.  The broiled shrimp dinner is amazing as well.  You won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and have yet to have a bad meal. The homemade pizzas are pretty decent, great burgers, and pastas. Very consistent quality. The back dining area can get a bit loud due to the poor acoustics, but what can you do... Not a bad choice if you're hungry."}
{"text":"We had a gift card to use and decided to carry out some tasty morsels.  My wife and I split a french dip with fries and an order of \"pizza fries\".  The french dip was very good.  Plenty of meat - not fatty.  The \"straight fries\" weren't the standard french fry I was expecting.  They were more of a parmesan-coated fry with some sort of mild seasoning.  They were excellent!  The pizza fries were the feature for us - while pricey for something so simple to make, they are A-MAZING.  Cheese and garlic on a pizza crust, cut into strips.  I could have eaten the whole thing, been miserable, and loved it.  Looking over the menu, it's a little higher-priced than I would expect for a small town restaurant, but so far they have backed it up with delicious food and friendly service.  A couple year ago we held a little league banquet in the room upstairs.  Their pizza was really good and that room is excellent for hosting a decent-sized gathering.    The outdoor patio does well when the weather allows - there always seem to be people out there when I'm driving by."}
