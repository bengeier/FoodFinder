{"text":"Love Solita! The couple who owns this place is always so welcoming. Coffee is great and the meatball sandwich is amazing!!!! Unique imported goods straight from Italy. This is my go to place if I want a little piece of Italy :)"}
{"text":"Solita, aka South of Little Italy, is actually located a little bit south and west of Little Italy. The store features a mixed bag of prepared food, imported jars and canned items, a deli counter, a bar area with coffee and beer, and even a gelato section.

I stopped in to peruse what was on offer, and tried a couple sandwiches in the process. The sandwiches are hot panini pressed focaccia bread with a variety of meat options. Kudos to the fact that they are made fresh to order, however take that into consideration as it will be about 10 minutes before your sandwich is ready even if the place is empty.

I tried both the Meatball and the Veal paninis. The Meatball was the clear winner in the bunch. I believe the meatballs were housemade which would explain the tenderness in the meat ball. It was a tasty sandwich, no question.
The veal on the other hand was weak in flavour and mediocre in comparative size. It was still okay, but a footnote in the world of veal sandwiches in Toronto.
You're paying around $13 after tax each, for just a sandwich with only cheese added, no other vegetables. ingredients, or side dishes. On the value front, this is not the place to go.

But nothing here is cheap. Even the charcuterie in their deli section was $3 - $6 per 100g. I'm sure some of this cured meat had been imported, but I've certainly had no issue finding cheaper prosciutto or other tasty options in the neighbourhood so I'll keep sourcing my charcuterie plates elsewhere, just as I will my veal sandwiches. That meatball sandwich though, might just warrant a return sometime."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot. Free coffee with check in on yelp! Had meatball and proscuito panini. Nothing amazing but very decent and loved the bread part especially! Particularly liked the cannoli - freshest i've had!"}
{"text":"Great Place,

Vikki and her husband both run this beautiful cafe joint. The cafe was beautifully built by themselves. Had a meeting their with a friend who recommended the place by fellow co-workers who lived around the area. My partner and I had the porchetta panini and it was great. 

They also serve bread and other italian oriented grocery. So if you ever need to pick up some deli or have a break with a beer in head. Consider Solita!

Can't wait to go back."}
