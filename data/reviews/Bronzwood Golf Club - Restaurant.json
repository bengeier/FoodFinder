{"text":"Been here twice. Burgers are great. Brought back wife one Friday night for dinner. We waited almost 40 minutes until we were acknowledged and brought drinks. 20 minutes later, the waitress came out to us to tell us they were sold out of fish. I paid for our drinks and left to go eat elsewhere.   Normally I'm a very patient person, but that night rubbed me raw and I will never be back to eat there. I'm glad others did not have my experience."}
{"text":"My name is Saloma. I don't have access to a Facebook so I'm posting from my niece's page. On April 17, 2016, my husband and I golfed at this golf course. We had a great time until after we were done. It was around 8pm we discovered that my husband's coat was missing. It was still daylight out. We had just got off the golf cart and still had the keys with us. My husband decided to go back on the cart to retrace our steps. While on the green, a lady tracked him down and immediately started accusing him of stealing the cart and said that this cart has been sitting for 4 hours. Mind you, we had THIS same cart for the last four hours and how would we have the keys if we STOLE this cart???? This lady had blonde hair was supposedly part owner. I have never experienced such horrible customer service. We were trying to calmly explain that we were simply looking for our coat. There was no explaining anything to this woman. She was either drunk or just absolutely crazy. It was absolutely uncalled for and we will never return to that golf course again. Funny thing, they found his coat the next day!!"}
