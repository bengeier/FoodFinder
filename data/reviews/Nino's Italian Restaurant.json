{"text":"Nino's is a American Italian Restaurant we have eaten at many times.  We love the Red Sauce Pasta and the Pizza.  The fish is also very good.  The staff and owners are friendly and pleasant.  Definitely go."}
{"text":"Nino's is quite easily one of my favorite Italian restaurants on Cleveland's westside. The food has no equal, as far I know, but the only drawback is how big the portions are. The atmosphere is something that you would think to find in a Little Italy. All-round, it's quite worth your time, and it is reasonably price for what it has to offer."}
{"text":"We went to Nino's tonight for dinner. I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana. The breading on the chicken was awful, no flavor, and doughy not crispy.  I told the waitress I didn't like the chicken breading and she asked if I wanted another dinner. I said I would try the Chicken Martina, BUT she said all their chicken had breading, so why would I order another chicken dinner? I decided not to order another dinner because my boyfriend was already eating and I knew that by the time I got mine he would have been finished with his. Here's the real kicker......I DIDNT LIKE THE DINNER BUT THE OWNER CHARGED ME $7.00 FOR THE SALAD THAT CAME WITH THE DINNER THAT I DIDNT LIKE!!!!!      $7.00 FOR A DINNER SALAD!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.. Food was great, and plentiful.  Wait staff was very freindly and helpful"}
{"text":"I went to Ninos with my family for lunch. They are not kid friendly. I had requested a highchair and they said they didn't have any. When they went to seat us,three different employees came over and said \" we don't have highchairs.\" We got the message the first time. Going by the tone of the waitress they obviously didn't want our business. So we left very disappointed ."}
{"text":"I was here last night with my husband. We loved the food. It's amazing. They have quick nd good customer service."}
{"text":"We tried Ninos for the first time and we certainly will be back. Had the carbonara and it was amazing. HUGE portion and perfectly made. Our waiter was a very nice young man which was refreshing to see a lot of cal business hiring respectful young people. 

Very classic Italian restaurant with scratch made dishes."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a little child with my grandparents.  We loved it and the staff and the owner.  However, in the past six or so years it has been changed some how and the menu items taste different, and of course it is pricey, but that's how they do it in Italy anyway. haha  Overall, I still like the place, but do not go there nearly as much as I used to."}
{"text":"The service was good. Calamari was fresh. Meatballs were dense. Ordered the cavatelli .  Sauce was very Italian  served In a plate with sides hence a bowl which is much better than a plate.  Sausage was like grandmas."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed. Huge portions of home cooked Italian food, that could never be matched by a chain restaurant. I see a review with one star on this page, it can not be for the same place! Some folks are complaining about the prices, but I feel they are more than fair for what you receive.
  The super friendly staff and cozy atmosphere add to the awesomeness of Nino's. 
I'm not going to say much more, other than try it yourself."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was hesitant to pay \"that much\" for a plate of pasta.  I'm so glad I listened to all of the positive reviews and went to Nino's finally after living in North Ridgeville for close to a decade.  This is seriously the best Italian food I've had outside of NYC.  Portions are huge but do not taste mass produced.  The canolli was amazing.  Definitely tastes like Italy landed on Center Ridge Road.  I just can't say enough about how delicious this food is.  I can't wait to get back to Nino's!"}
{"text":"We had some friends suggest this place to us and they are true friends. From the time we walked in til the time we were leaving , we were treated with politeness and many smiles which let's you enjoy your meal even more. I went with the veal parmesan while my sweetheart went with the lasagna,  both were very good. The service was fantastic as well. We finished with the cheesecake,  and that sealed the deal, one of our new favorite places to eat. Enjoy to everyone that goes there."}
{"text":"Omg this is the best food I have had in years. Very generous helpings of the most perfectly cooked delicious food.  I cannot say enough good about it, even the desert, strawberry shortcake was perfection.  Great and friendly service, comfortable!  Wow.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at nino's. I had an eggplant dish,which was delicious. There were some enticing vegetarian options. The environment is warm and the Christmas tree with Nino's face in it is hilarious!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Nino's a few weeks ago after passing by it for years.  I have been missing out. Great pasta and pizza!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Ninos three times. You get quite a bit for the price. I usually order the shrimp premevera. The first time was the best. The other two times weren't as good. The taste isn't consistent. I guess it depends on who the chef is at the time. 
They have two sides and there's always a wait. Even though they have expanded it's a pretty tight squeeze. I will go again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere/ kid friendly. Great food, bread, and house wine!  They take the time to wipe down the menus each night. The owner even took time to walk through dining room and talk with guests. Just wondering how we never found this place before now. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place when I randomly looked for an Italian restaurant near my location. Amazing food! I had lasagna, and there was so much food I made three meals out of it. The salad was a meal in itself. I forget what my girlfriend ate, but she pigged out too. Don't tell her I said that. 
Highly recommend this place, very pleasant staff to boot!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there this evening with an old friend.  We have been here a few times before, but for lunch. The food is extraordinary.   No matter what we order it is always fabulous, fresh, hot and plentiful.   The wait staff is so good that we never have to ask for anything.  Tonight our waiter was Zack.  Very pleasant young man.  Even the owner remembers us and commented that we are usually lunch guests.  Also, with the large number of diners tonight, we were pleased to see that everyone was being served quickly.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I am craving it  just writing about it.It has been here a long time, although this is my first time here. I came with my friend Sherry, who had her rehearsal dinner here 24 years ago. So it has been here awhile.
It is Family owned and that must be why it is so good. They care about what they serve and how they serve it!
We came here on a week night. We were greeted by the owner when we came in and were seated right away in the dining room. 
Service was very good even though they got quite busy.
Dinner was magnificent! I got the FantaSea. I loved it!! The portion was huge it is Seafood and in a White sauce.  My friend Sherry got the Eggplant Parm, it too was fantastic!

We had an appetizer of Calamari. Of course with all this food we took a lot to go. We were far too full to have dessert. Will have to try it another day.
Ladies room was clean and lots of parking in the huge parking lot they share in the strip mall. This place is well worth a try."}
{"text":"Came here for a recent \"lunch adventure\" with coworkers and we had a wonderful meal.  The service was attentive and the food was rock solid.

To start with, our server brought out a bread basket filled with warm Italian bread and small sesame-covered breadsticks.  The bread with served with a creamy herbed butter.

My meal came with a side salad which had a well-herbed (but light) Italian dressing along with spiral pasta and small pepperonis on top.  Delicious!

One of my colleagues ordered an appetizer for the three of us to share...Calamari.  The fried squid was on the firm side, but not chewy, and served with their hearty, zesty marinara sauce.

My one colleague and I shared to main dishes.  The chicken Parmesan was plump, moist and lightly breaded served with homemade (thick) spaghetti and the same hearty red sauce.  The blanco Margherita pizza had a crust that was a bit too thick for my tastes, but the flavor was simple with fresh tomatoes, basil and a briny cheese.

We all enjoyed our meal, then went back to work to nap under our desks. ;-)  Thanks Nino's!!!"}
{"text":"This place has such an authentic feel, from the hustle and bustle to the tables just far enough from each other for you to stretch your legs but close enough to feel like it's one big communal meal.  Go crazy on the bread & butter, then prepare to take home around half of what you ordered.   The lasagna is a thick block of meat and pasta sheets, totally drenched in sauce (but you should still ask for extra).   We also had the chicken/mushroom pasta & the whitefish.    Sauce is amazing on the chicken dish and the portion is quite large, the fish was frozen & came out soggy & the plate needed draining of way too much olive oil.   Still, we'll work our way around that dish and make it back there this summer."}
{"text":"Although we agree that the food is expensive... we felt that we were served a lot of food and by the time you're done it's worth it. We shared a wonderful appetizer and dinner and still had leftovers! The quantity of food and quality of food makes the prices acceptable."}
{"text":"Service was good.   Pasta was ok.  Ordered cavatelli and it had a burnt taste to it.   My son had spaghetti and meatballs.   Was the better of the two dishes but other Italian restaurants in the area are far better."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic! I have never ordered anything we didn't absolutely love.   We always get the neptunes pasta with red sauce and split it. The lemon cake is breathtaking!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cozy and romantic this is the place for you. I am a little partial to Nino's as my wife and I came here for our first date ten years ago. That being said their sauces and meatballs are without comparison in our area. They've also got the best salads I've ever tasted! It is definitely an intimate atmosphere as there isn't a lot of seating. Prices are right about where you'd expect for a small independent Italian restaurant.  There specialties are pasta and pizza. My wife and I always split the white pizza and love eating the leftovers the day after. I would highly recommend Nino's for a date night or anniversary spot."}
{"text":"We had friends introduce us to Nino's and we continue to come back. I personally wouldn't order a spaghetti dish in any dinner place as it is too easy to make on your own. However if you get something you can't make, it is very good. It is rather pricey, but we always have extra to take home for two more meals. One star for price is definitely uncalled for."}
{"text":"Yum yum and more yum!  Serving size is ginormous and that aside the food was hot, flavorful and authentic.  Came up to see the holiday lights and will come back for the food!"}
{"text":"When my mom and dad were dating they once ate dinner at my dad's mom's house.  Grandma G. served tomato paste and noodles and called it spaghetti.  Nino's does the same. Not only do they charge you an arm and a leg for it but they even go as far as to charge extra for meatballs or meatsauce!  If you like bland, boring food look no further, Nino's is for you.  Honestly, I can make better spaghetti at home.  Ignore the hype.  Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place.  I had the Chicken Parm, and it was pretty good.  It's a nice little family joint, kinda small, so you might have to wait for a table at dinner.  We went for lunch, and the lunch prices were pretty decent.  I would maybe think twice about going for dinner, because the dinner menu is a bit more expensive than other Italian places.  They do give you a nice salad though with your meal, which is an extra charge at some places though."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Ohio!! Amazing prices, amazing food, amazing portions, amazing service and amazing location (plenty of parking). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great when you eat in, but double check your order if you order it to go.  Paid and to my disappointment, it was not the correct order. I ordered Veal Marsala and they brought me Veal Parmigiana. It was okay but not what I ordered. I called right away and they said to call back and talk to the cook? 

I have never had a problem when going there in person.so I recommend to eat in and enjoy it."}
{"text":"After reading rave reviews about this place for years, I decided that it was about time to take a drive from the East Side and find out for myself.  Upon entering you are immediately greeted by staff and promptly seated.  The interior is low-lit, but has a very warm, inviting ambience that suites the atmosphere.  Now for the food; it is of exceptional quality and comes in generous portions that are quite satisfying for even the most prodigious appetites (such as mine)!  Nino's is as good as it gets and I look forward to eating here quite often!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Nino's since my teens for birthday dinners and occasional family outings and I still love it. The FantaSea is the best, but the last time I went I had the Pasta Vito and it was equally amazing. I agree the prices are high, but the portions are so big, I literally made 3 big meals out of my last entree.  
I'm usually full after the delicious bread and homemade garlic butter. And there house salad is yummy too, great house dressing. 

They just built a big outside patio, but I still prefer inside. The quirky decor is charming. 

I always wonder how people can have such different experiences at the same place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  My favorite is the Chicken Martina!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Nino's for over 20 years and we keep coming back...The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff is always welcoming and great. Tom, the owner, knows and greets each guest and the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in Italy. The portions are large (easily shareable) with all home made pastas and delicious sauces. 1 dish can easily be shared by two, and 3 if folks have smaller appetites. Everything is fresh and we have not had a dish we did not love. Our favorites are the Eggplant fries and Pasta Vito (a house speciality). It is a great neighborhood restaurant and hope it stays that way for us to bring our grandkids!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food. The portion sizes are huge definitely could share next time. Our sever was great."}
{"text":"Went in at 8:45, looking to get wine and an appetizer. Upon entering we were told that they close in 15 minutes and that if we came in we HAD to order food. Seriously, youre open till 9 then when I come in at 8:45 it means your open. We would have ordered food and a bottle of wine, probably spending over $100. Maybe spend 3 min. I will take my money else where, you were totally rude. Never again"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! After my summer in Italy I looked so long for an authentic Italian restaurant and this stuffed gnocchi here was amazing! So great! Meals come with a delicious salad and garlic butter for the bread, which are both awesome as well. Reasonably priced and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lasagna. is. amazing. Oh yea so is the fettuccine alfredo. The food tastes like it came right out of your Italian grandmothers kitchen. I wish I was there eating right now....mmmm lasagna."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for years.  How can there be a good restaurant in North Ridgeville?

Recently met an older lady who married into an Italian family.  She told me that the mother-in-law took her sauce recipe to the grave and Nino's was the only place that comes close in taste and quality.  I decided to give Nino's a try.

It was cold and frigid outside, record breaking February weather.  I was surprised to see so many people had ventured out to eat.  The place was fairly busy for a sub-zero Tuesday night.  

Everything about this place is amazing.  I ordered chicken parm and was delighted to see that they didn't pull a lump of chicken out of a SYSCO bag.  It appeared to have a homemade crust.  

The sauce was pure and smooth.  I don't like chunky sauce.  No huge hit of garlic.  No aftertaste when I got home.  A perfect tasty blend of flavor and texture.  Nino's serves plenty of sauce with their entrees so you don't have to beg for more. 

The staff is so nice, but it doesn't matter.  I would go there anyway.   

As for their prices, I never mind paying for quality.  The portions are large and the flavors are spot on.  This is not Olive Garden, not even in the same league.

I drive by Nino's several times per week.  There are a lot of cars parked out front everytime.  They also do carry outs."}
{"text":"Thanks! Pay for one dish and eat it for a week unless you aren't counting calories then you can finish it in 3 days. 

Price for the food after the above statement should be reasonable. Paid $99 for 3 dishes and a tiramisu including tips and a split plate charge of $5. 

Service is friendly and super fast. They close by 9pm on a Friday night. I would say it was busy but not packed around 8pm. 

Shrimp primavera was the best dish for the nice kick of the arabiatta sauce. 6 shrimps and few jumbo mushrooms had to be searched in between the mountains of penne pasta. 

The broccolicios ginormous chicken martina is Nino' favorite which is very rich due to the creamy alfredo sauce and I will devour it over the next 6 days since I try to eat only 2000 calories a day. 

Penne pasta ordered from the main menu for 2 kids was charged a split fee . Got two salads which today's kids don't have an appetite for, good for us we got two more dinners out of it since the size of them with the entree was huge. A lunch or dinner by itself. Obviously They don't have kids menu. 

The garlic butter was tasty but didn't have space for the Italian bread which they offered to pack for us, sigh if only we had come in two different cars! We would have enough room to accommodate them. 

The tiramisu was delicious, don't have to wonder how I had space for it, it was ordered to go but by the time we carried the heavy bags of left over food and putting it in our refrigerator we were hungry to not resist eating a spoon or two. It needed a lot of self control to put it in the refrigerator for a later day. 

On hind sight could have just ordered the shrimp primavera and tiramisu, paid all the split plate fees and still have filled every ones belly and left with some to take home with

Now I am ready to watch se7en. My stomach has already burst!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, salads are phenomenal, but the pricing is way out of control.  If they cut their prices in half, I would be a regular here."}
{"text":"Being here for the first time on a Valentine Day, with my whole family, all couoles of course. This place is amazing, food is out of this world. The service is top notch. The food totally 100% Italian, not a glam food sort of ethnic place. I recommend this place for a date night and movie after...if you can stay awake, after you're done eating."}
{"text":"I ate at Nino's with a group on friends on Saturday night. The place was packed, and after trying the food I understood why. The bread, salad and eggplant appetizer were all delicious. For my entree I tried the pasta Pompeii, excellent! The only change I would make would be using plain artichokes instead of breaded. Breaded just didn't fit the dish. Someone else at my table had their red sauce which was equally delicious. I would absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"This was our firsy visit, and we can't wait to go back. We went looking for a decent pizza, and they did not disappoint. It was excellent. As we were enjoying our pizza we watched all of the other dinners go by. We will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE their pizza.  Most of the entrees are a bit pricey but the pizza is reasonable and the best around!  And although the entrees are expensive, they are HUGE and can easily be split between two people.  The Italian wedding soup is also a winner in my book!  I love the ambiance of this restaurant.  Very small and cozy and the service is always good."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is overrated and also is overpriced. My wife and I both had pasta and it was just average. I had the marinara sauce, which is a $3 up charge. The bread was also just average. It was not warmed and tasted like bread you might find in a grocery store. Also, the house chianti was simply not good. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Great portions and service. The restaurant recently expanded, so now there is a separate room for large parties. The food is all home made and has a real Italian Family atmosphere. It is near impossible to leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Nino's, after seeing it on New Day Cleveland. It's been years since I visited an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant. It was quite a delicious experience, not to mention the hospitality of waitress! The owner even came to our table and carried on a delightful conversation with us. Best Italian food in Lorain county.... if you're looking for authenticity, great ambiance and delicious food! Look forward to our next visit. (Delicious herbed butter to go along with fresh bread!)"}
{"text":"I don't think the one star was quite fair, but I do agree that this place is overpriced.  I think the food is very good, and the menu does have some items that you would not expect to see (in a good way), but I do feel like everything is about twice as much as what it should cost.  I enjoy the staff and the atmosphere and would go there much more if it wasn't so darn pricey!"}
{"text":"Overall a really good italian restaurant. It is very very americanized though. Sauces have garlic on it and the carbonara is not really authentic. However I found the pasta here much better than Dante in downtown. The service was spectacular and the glass of Chianti was excellent! The fried mozzarella was fresh but the marinara sauce had garlic. When I mentioned the garlic, the server said \"it is Italian it needs garlic\" WHAT?? NO NO NO NO and NO! Garlic is American way of cooking italian to mask bad taste of the sauce. Real italian marinara sauce has FRESH tomatoes, olive oil, salt and that's it!

Still a great place to eat however the pasta portion is huge and can feed 3 easily. Such a waste of food. They should reduce the portion and lower the price as this restaurant it is not on the cheap side."}
{"text":"Meals were really good. We ordered fried formaggio cheese appetizer which was delicious. The salads were really good, there was a scoop of pasta on top of the greens. We both ordered the chicken parm. The pasta was delicious, but neither of us was crazy about the chicken. Don't get me wrong, it tasted ok but it wasn't crispy and I missed that. It wasn't dry or anything and there was definitely an herb flavor, it just wasn't great. 

I was stuffed after dinner, but my husband had the Tiramisu and it was delicious. 

It is a bit pricey here - just be warned."}
{"text":"Our all time favorite authentic Italian restaurant. Their marinara sauce is the best in the city north, south, east west. Lmn"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Nino's enough now to finally update my rating to 5 stars.  The food is sooo good and the service is outstanding.  When I think of Ninos, I think of old school Italian and that's exactly the impression that they want you to leave here with.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying no one from Texas knows pizza or sauce; their BBQ is lacking as well. Ninos' meat sauce is one of the best and made from scratch- just ask for some neck bones when there and you will know why the sauce is so good. The portions are enough for two, the pizza is all quality items with a great crust. I am willing to pay for high quality."}
{"text":"Over priced, decor is out dated, bad menu descriptions (example I ordered the gnocchi and got ravioli instead). However, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. Their meatballs are to die for. The garlic butter and bread basket is so so so good. Their house salad had tri colored pasta in it and their Italian salad dressing is amazing. Penne and meatballs is my go to but you have to try their lasagna at some point.  There is nothing like it. We would order trays of it for holidays and family gatherings. Triple chocolate cake, yes please! It is huge! My family has been going here for years and years now. Definitely one of our favs and hard to top! Nino is always there cooking in the kitchen! :)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying i'm not really an Italian food fan.  Typically I find myself bringing home leftovers that I end up never eating.

That is not the case for this small restaurant.  I may never be the biggest Italian food fan, but it speaks volumes to me when I can actually look forward to eating my leftovers."}
{"text":"Our table ordered the rib eye steak special, eggplant parmesan, veal and salmon piccata. All four dishes were delicious, cooked to perfection and portions enough for take home. And incredible house salad. Reasonable prices for all they serve. Service equally excellent. It's a regular for my family and I understand why."}
{"text":"if you live on the west side and don't want to drive to little Italy this is the place to go. I love love love nino's.  Sauce is  awesome,  HOmemade food.  They even have pork neck bones.  The staff have been there for years and are very friendly and well trained.  They aim to please.  Portions are huge just like a real Italian family having you over for homemade pasta."}
{"text":"Delicious Food, excellent service, nice wine selections, and the homemade cheesecake is one of the best I have ever had ( and I am not a cheesecake fan). It is all cheesecake and no crust...wonderful, creamy, airy goodness. I enjoyed the pasta vito: for someone who does not make choices easily, I was able to have both the beautiful red sauce and agilo e olio sauce in the dish. Absolutely 100% amazing! Oh and the garlic butter....I can not forget to mention the galic butter...Oooohhh and their homeade italian salad dressing! I did not have one thing I did not love at this place!

As for the atmosphere, a cute, intimate setting- great for a date night. 

I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I love this pace for Italian. The garlic butter is absolutely amazing. I also love their sass which has some pasta salad and meats inside of it. The cavatelli is vey good."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that I have never reviewed Nino's! My family has been coming here for a long, long time. It's fabulous. The atmosphere is very quaint and intimate. We were most recently here last night with another couple. We shared the appetizer special of fried zucchini and eggplant. It was perfectly cooked and not greasy. I tend to order the eggplant Parmesan with a meatball on the side because I can never choose between the best meatballs I've had since my Nonna passed, or the best eggplant Parmesan in the state. 

The eggplant Parmesan is actual eggplant - not too thinly sliced that all you taste is breading, and not too thick that you can't bite through the skin. It's perfect.  

Yes, portions are huge. It's run by an Italian family. Have you ever been to dinner hosted by an Italian family? It's just like that."}
{"text":"Consistantly the best Italian food on the west side! Tommy has an incredibly well trained kitchen staff who deliver excellent food every time.  We have never had a bad meal there in over twenty years of frequenting this establishment. The prices are a little high, butt the portions are enormous! It's easily two meals for us.

The only complaint is that they do not have high chairs, so don't plan on taking small children without your own seating for them."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I'm not eating there I am picking up sauce to serve at home for friends. It's true Italian give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ninos is one of my top Italian restaurants to go too! Never had a disappointing meal here and pretty good dessert!"}
{"text":"In all travels throughout this country, I have finally found Mecca...the slice of heaven called down home Italian!
Simply THE best small, family run hole in the wall anywhere!
Small, intimate atmosphere coupled with the family wait staff screams Little Italy.  
Portions are HUGE, even for split plates!  I enjoyed the three meat pasta which included meatballs, sausage, and a pork neck!  The homemade meat sauce was perfectly flavored!  Simply delicious!
Another in my party dined on chicken parmesan.  Best ever eatened!
Everything fresh, everything homemade.  Affordable for Italian places.
The only problem is how to get there on a weekly basis...400 miles seems excessive to drive...but....for this food, it would be worth ever penny.

Nino's is now on my \"must list.\"  Every time I pass this area, you will find me here."}
{"text":"If I'm going to be on the west side and feel like some Italian, Nino's is now the place I'll be going to.  I'm not just saying that because I ordered a whole bottle of wine for myself, I'm honestly not...

Their meals were well priced (all you Yelpers saying it should be half off, go buy yourself a Subway sub because I don't know what you're talking about), amply sized, well served and delicious!  

I ordered the stuffed gnocchi, which came with a salad.  The gnocchi was extremely rich and in a creamy blush sauce.  Typically I'm happy with a standard old gnocchi and maybe stuffing it was over-doing it, but man...they were delicious little bites of puffiness.  The only downfall was that by the time that came, I was already full.  The salad we ordered (which we ordered with cheese, a must do!), was HUGE and I cleaned up every last little bit of pasta/lettuce bits.  

We also ordered a small \"old world\" style pizza with sausage, and a side cup of provolone.  Apparently this is the way to do it, and I whole heartedly agree.   

So if you're keeping a tally, before my meal I had pizza, a huge salad and I haven't even mentioned the herbed butter bread.  So in short, I ate probably two little gnocchi bits before having it boxed to bring home.  

Good thing I had that whole bottle of wine to wash it down with, huh?"}
{"text":"Very good, but prices are a bit high for North Ridgeville.  They are very busy on the weekends and would definitely bring in more weekday business if they lowered their prices.  Prepare to wait for a table on the weekends quite a while."}
