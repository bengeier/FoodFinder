{"text":"Decent pub in my hotel.  Not sure how busy this place gets but it was pretty empty on a Monday night.  Food and service were both great.  Bar keep did a great job taking care of everyone."}
{"text":"I stayed up the road at the Sheraton for two weeks and with few options in the area, I frequented this pub for at least 6 visits to watch the Jays. The service was excellent from Denny, the girls and owner Alex. The atmosphere was great, prices are very reasonable and the food was good too. They really make you feel welcome and go out of their way to get to know their customers. If you are in the area drop in, you won't be disappointed. Cheers Alex! Thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend who was flying out the next day.  We met here as her hotel was attached to the pub.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Being so close to the airport I was expecting much higher prices but the prices were really reasonable.   Grabbed a burger and a drink while we chatted and caught up.  The staff were friendly and it had a great pub feel to it.  I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Decent pub in the Comfort Inn near the Toronto Airport.  They have a number of beer on tap including Guinness and cider.  Once you walk in it has a pub feel with cherry wood.  They have a pool table and fooz ball table.  A couple of TV screens.  Food is very reasonably priced and not bad.  American meals.  They have entrees with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  From $8 to 18 dollars.  A lot of locals come here in the evening.  All in all better than expected for a budget hotel."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Hard to mess up bar food, but they succeed. I wanted extra salsa with quesadilla and they wanted an extra buck. Wrong. Goodbye forever."}
