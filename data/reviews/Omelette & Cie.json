{"text":"I am regular almost weekly customer because i love beeakfast and i love the food ( better than chez coras abd dejeuner inc). Undortunately it was bought over by new owners and they made some changes. I usually go for their amazing hollandaise sauce but today it was def below average. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Accès facile à un bon brunch sur l'île Bizard.  Le service est correct et le menu contient les classiques et quelques plats plus originaux, comme un Benedict à la grec ou sur une gaufre (servi avec beaucoup de fruits frais). Ils ont un choix de patate \"frites\" ou \"pilées\".  Les pilées sont bonnes, les frites un peu trop graisseusent  Ce n'est pas trop achalandé et il y a une terrace au soleil."}
{"text":"With an outdoor terrace, it is one of Montreal's perfect place to soak up some sun while eating out without having to break the bank. Everything is approximately in the $15 range and the food tastes just fine. However, don't hope for the prettiest of presentation or the finest of cuisine as you get what you pay for. The standards are there and we even felt that we got more more food (in terms of quantity) than what we paid for."}
{"text":"There is a noticeable void in brunch & breakfast places on the West Island; this is the best option that we've found. O&C provide many different versions of the standard salty \"American\" breakfast plus the euro addition of beans and creton. They don't \"sweeten\" the potatoes (like the Hotdog Station) and coffee is free.  If you arrive before 8:30, you can get the early bird deal (half price). Kids eat for free on Saturday.  The place is rather huge and packed on most days after 10am; that said, we've never had to wait for a seat. Service is super fast... we're typically in and out in 30-45mins depending on how busy it is. On nice days you can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"awesome place to eat ! I love breakfast and this place will not let you down the waffles are unbelievable and the potatoes to !;))"}
{"text":"Want to start of by saying \"The food is amazing\". It is most probably the best breakfast place in west island i would say its a hidden gem, right off the bridge when entering L'Ile-Bizard. There is tons of dishes to choose from and they're food has always been fresh and good! My favorite is probably the Eggs Benedict on a bagel lux its just out of this world experience and that hollandaise sauce!! You can choose from breakfast or mashed potatoes or 50/50.. They have good rye bread good coffee, and its St-Viateur Bagels! lots of healthy options as well.  These last few items are important when choosing a Breaky place!!  Been going there weekly for over 2 years!!  Really a must try in west-island with an outdoor terrace in summer you wont regret! Tried these next few on several occasions (Dejeuner inc, K73, Petinos-good place too, cosmopolitan, Ben&Flo and was never as impressed as Omelette Inc.!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! I came here with my friends from Massachusetts and we all loved our food! The French toast sandwich was incredible. The food here was so fresh with a beautiful presentation. We are definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time, it's nearby. Last time we went the food was nothing like it used to be. And the main reason is that I went to the restroom, one of the chef was using the urinal and went back to the kitchen without washing his hands. If he doesn't do it in front of a customer, I can only imagine when he does. Never again."}
