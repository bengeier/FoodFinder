{"text":"Just ordered pizza from Roma tonight and it was amazing!  Years ago I used to come to Saint Lazare to go to Chez Maurice, and I remembered Bravo being the best pizza place around, so I was excited to move to Saint Lazare with my family, and could not wait to introduce them to Bravo ...  We ordered a Bravo pizza and I was not impressed with it at all!  I saw Roma when pulling into IGA last week, and a friend said they were decent, so tonight we ordered from Roma, and it was seriously the best pizza I have had in a long time!  Very fresh ingredients, and cooked just right. The crust was not \"raw\", nor was it overlooked and hard.  We will definitely order again very soon!!"}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza for delivery from here a couple of times, so I can't comment on the restaurant, but the pizza was really good and delivery was pretty quick."}
{"text":"Nice pizza joint in Saint-Lazare.  Cozy dining room and good sized terrace. Staff is courteous and the couple who run the place are always there.  We've eaten pizza from Roma both as pick-up and dine-in. Pizza is well garnished, hot and filling.  Sauce is great and dough is delicious."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. We regularly get the Roma special. Plus you get a free pizza when you collect their coupons with each order."}
