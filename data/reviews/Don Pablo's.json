{"text":"Went there with a group of men from my church.  The service was excellent.  Unfortunately, I forget the our server's name to give her credit but she was fantastic.  It was all you can eat fajita night last night.  We all got our money's worth.  The fajitas were quite tasty, especially the steak ones.  We polished off quite a bit of food.  But the most delicious thing was the desert.  One person ordered one, and I don't even know what it was or what it was called, but it was like a fried tortilla with a honey-type sauce on it and powdered sugar.  Oh my, was it absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! if you have 4 hours on ur hands to wait then this is your place, horrible food and service! and  thats not just from one visit its been 3 ( i thought i would give another chance"}
{"text":"We go here for lunch all the time.  Quick service and the queso is yummy. Try taco Tuesday.  Unlimited tacos.  The tortilla chips are made right there.    The only problem is the rest rooms are not as clean as I would like them to be"}
{"text":"Last Wednesday we tried to go to Don Pablo's around 8pm. We were greeted by a hostess and told her we were going upstairs to the bar. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes (we set a timer half way through) and not one staff member ever came upstairs. We went back downstairs to try to get a table, but the hostess was nowhere to be found. We stood there for about 5 minutes until she came back and during that time about 5 other staff members, including a manager, looked over at us and never came over. We were finally sat at a table and after another 5 minutes were never even given waters or greeted by the server. There was probably 5 total tables in the restaurant at this time.   On our way out I asked to speak with a manager and the hostess took me over to the female manager who was sitting down eating at a table near the kitchen. I work in the service industry so I absolutely could not leave without bringing this horrible experience to someones attention. She apologized and offered to take care of our meals if we stayed, but at that point it was too late and we just wanted to get out of there. We were more than happy to pay for those meals if someone had helped us during the 20 minutes we were sitting there. I just wanted a margarita! We left and went to Mad Mex where we got excellent and speedy service."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of weeks ago and didn't have the best experience.  We waited over ten minutes to be greeted.  (we were preparing to leave when we were greeted) and they were not busy.  There were perhaps 15 tables all together, and there were at least 5 waitstaff there that I counted.  The waitress was polite when we're being waited on and the food for the most part was tasty. A bit cold but not the worst Mexican food that I have had."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 I would. Bad food, bad service, restaurant is dirty and not well maintained.  Specifically, our server was not familiar with the menu, I ordered an Arnold Palmer and there was black mold in the drink, fruit flies everywhere, shells in my shrimp fajitas and broken bathroom stall, broken hand soap dispenser and the other hand dispenser was empty of soap. How are severs and cooks washing their hands?!?! Overall disgusting and I will never go back. I should have known better when it's 615on a Saturday and the restaurant was practically empty. Don't waste your money- go to mad mex instead or el campesino."}
{"text":"The complimentary tortilla chips were the best chips I have ever eaten. Worth going there for the chips alone! Sad to see it go from the Robinson location!!"}
{"text":"Our server and the manager were friendly but the food was just awful.  Everyone raves about the chips and salsa but the chips are like cardboard and the salsa us like tomatoes from a can.  The enchiladas were a value, but were possibly the most bland I've ever had.  Save your money and go to a real Mexican restaurant like El Campesino."}
{"text":"Wife ordered ribs and the rib meat lack flavor (was it beef or pork?) and also lacked BBQ sauce, they think chili sauce is BBQ sauce in this restaurant (hint: folks coming from Texas, don't even darken the door to this place).  The enchiladas that I ordered, also lacked flavor, just watered down chili sauce.  If they need some real Mexicans to help with getting the cooking straight, we have plenty in California we can send!"}
{"text":"Was in this restaurant for 30 minutes. Waited 10 minutes for a hostess to appear. She then complained about the customers instead of offering to seat us. We asked to sit upstairs in a both, she said to go ahead. When we went up the waitress told us we couldn't even though all the booths were empty. She finally relented and told us to sit in a dirty booth on the other side with obvious distain. She gave us the dirtiest menus I have ever seen. It was as though they were used as place mats. We then waited another 15 min and she never returned so we left, only after washing our hands. I called the manager from the parking lot to tell him about our experience. He could only offer \"I'm sorry\" and \"we are short staffed\". It was a Friday and the restaurant was mostly empty. Avoid this establishment at all costs!"}
{"text":"The very best Tex Mex restaurant. If you were a Chi Chi's fan you will enjoy Don Pablos. The service is excellent, the food fresh, and the cheese sauce Queso dip is the best anywhere! At times they do not melt the cheese in the enchiladas and I have to send them back, but over all I am very pleased. We drive one hour 2 times a month just to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love love love this location!  I always stop here and take advantage of their great lunch specials when flying into the Pittsburgh airport."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now both times because I love the soup (tortilla soup) and the classic salad combo. My first visit was awful the hostess had no idea what he was doing and moved my seat 2x because he \"over sat\" a server. The waitress then tried to argue with me over what was on their menu and I finally had to show her by pointing it out. The soup and salad can be made endless for under $10 but when I ordered a refill she decided to just charge me for the whole thing again.   I never know how difficult it is to understand when a customer HATES TOMATOES both times at this place the servers have messed that up on not only the initial order but the refill as well..   I will continue to come here because I really do love the soup the staff not so much."}
{"text":"What kind of BS place is this?!?!  OK, so this is corporate, chain-food.  I'm not going to get authentic Mexican here; I get that.  Never expected it.  But here's where you get me, Don Pablos.  Here's where you get your 1-star of F-you, you suck.  I got spammed constantly with your \"all you can eat taco Tuesday\" deal, and I thought, \"Well hey, for all I can eat, I can deal with it being sub-par corporate BS.\"  But it was so below the sub-par I had in mind.  Don Pablo's, you gave me all that I could eat tacos, but the caveat....NO SAUCE!  Just dry, plain tacos.  Want sauce with that?  It'll cost you like, an extra 2 bucks or something per tiny cup.  Don't even try to get guacamole (which, of course, is actually just mashed avocado, and not really guacamole as it ought to be...)  Seriously?  Here's your review.  Here's what I think of your deal:  It's no deal at all, and it's false advertising.  How many tasteless tacos do you think I want to eat?  Do you think that I like you when you lure me in and then impose fees on me to get sauce?  You suck, and F you."}
{"text":"Great food. But this location is closed permanently as of 9/1/2015. I'm heartbroken food was awesome."}
{"text":"A total waste of calories.  Ordered hard tacos and the waitress brought out soft tacos, but with some hard tacos (unfilled) on a plate. She said that I could switch them out (?) at the table or she'd take them back to the kitchen and have them do it.  How about just bringing the right stuff in the first place? The LAST thing i would do is send them back to the kitchen to be \"fixed\".  Also had refried beans...inedible as they were too salty to eat, and the tilapia in the tacos tasted like dirt.  I wouldn't eat here again if somebody gave me a gift certificate......WAIT!! someone did give me a gift certificate!  Glad I didn't have to pay for this meal."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the food.    My brother had the beef and chicken fajitas and it was a good portion.  I had the Chile rellenos and taco.  It's hard to find a good chile relleno here in the north and this place had it almost spot on.  Service was okay.  I did have to chase the waitress down to get my brother a few more soft tortillas because three was simply not enough for the amount of food they served.  Probably if I didn't have to go find her, I would have given it four starts. They weren't that busy and they had enough staff on the floor that I shouldn't have had to go get her.  Over all, it was good food for what we had and will be going back again."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Being that we are transplants from AZ, it is hard to find authentic Mexican food that is good.  Their food is yummy and they also show the caloric count for each item on their menu.  Very helpful!  We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Picked Hubbie up from the airport & wanted some Mexican, this was as close as we got and what a disappointment.   The dining area was dirtier than one would expect and although the waiter was friendly and polite, service was slow.   Hubbie ordered fish tacos but was disappointed the fish was Tilapia (bleh) and felt they lacked flavor. I had a crispy beef taco & a cheese enchilada. I was shocked at the amount of fresh cilantro that covered my enchilada. By the time I scraped it all off (I HATE cilantro), there was no sauce. The waiter brought more sauce and once that was set right, the enchilada was good. I like my tacos better than the one provided here. My secret ?: McCormick's Taco Seasoning.   We would not dine here again. A dirty dining area, slow service, meh food, and managers who hung out in a group by the bar, not checking on a single customer once all add up to a place I'd rather not be."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The ones we used to go to in Cleveland closed so we took the opportunity to try this location. The food was not as good as we remembered. Our waitress was great but way too much drama from some of the other waitresses and bartender. They seated us by the waiter station where they were constantly bickering and complaining about each other. Even dropping expletives at times and our family could hear everything they were saying. Not at all what should be happening in front if customers. We asked for the manager and told him what's going on and he just said he was sorry. He looked shocked and didn't know what else to say. Didn't offer us anything. We even ordered dessert and they didn't comp it. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"It's chain Mexican food. Not much more exciting than that. Server was attentive and at the table almost as much as the fruit flies were."}
{"text":"I can't believe how big this place is. We went last Wednesday during the week for an early dinner and were seated upstairs. The waiter was very friendly and the fresh chips were huge and crunchy. They have long hours for drink specials so I had a margarita- no complaints.   The portions are large and the prices are average. I got what I call the fat kid special because it was a combo with about seven different things and two sides. The spicy mashed potatoes were really good and had a nice kick to them and spooned cornbread was delicious. The empanadas were a little hard and on the small side and the taquitos were a little over fried but when it comes down to it, everything was edible and overall the experience was enjoyable.   I would definitely come back but my heart still belongs to El Paso in Chippewa."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6.  4 adults and 2 children. I have been to this restaurant many years ago and did not have a good experience. Thought we would give it another chance.   I dine all over the country and  Don Pablo's is not up to my standards,   Ice tea has no taste, lemonade weak, guacamole appetizer dissapointing. Small scoop, tasteless and the chips underneath were soggy.  My stuffed burrito which I ask for white queso cheese came cold and hard looking like plastic oner it. Grilled Chicken salad had water in the bottom of the bowl. Qusedia were cold with no taste.  The salsa that come to the table with the chips taste like you open a can of tomatoes to make spaghetti sauce.  Absolutely no taste. I have no intension to return knowing that I can get my Mexican fix elsewhere and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Walked into the establishment tonight with my two cousins.  There was a wait and tons of people waiting while there were multiple booths and tables open.  We asked our hostess that since there were high-tops available in the bar area if we could eat upstairs.  She said sure there is no wait to be seated in the bar area.  So off we went!  We we claimed an empty table and asked for it be cleared and cleaned.  We were then attacked by the waitress that \"This table is reserved for waiting people\"  We then tell her that the hostess told us it was OK for us to sit up here.  Well the waitress insisted that we couldn't sit there since it not open.  So she and her pissy attitude stormed off and went to belittle the hostessing staff.  While she was gone.... another waiter came over and basically said the same thing to us.  Needless to say... we stood our ground and claimed the table for the remaining of the evening.  We were so blessed to have to miserable soul as our waitress for the night.  My cousin ordered her dinner with special requests and when she got her food.... none of her requests were fulfilled. We asked multiple times to have our chips and salsa refilled and that was so as molasses. Me along with my cousins were in fear of asking for refills or additional special requests. As we were eating our dinner we witness our \"table situation\" happen again to another party that sat at another high-top.  Both waitress yelled at the customers and then SCREAMED at the hostess staff in addition to the waiter belittling the customer as he did to our party.  At the end of the evening our \"princess\" waitress came and asked if we needed checks.  I said yes but I am separate from my other two cousins.  Just make me separate and I requested a drink to go.  She so nicely rolled her eyes and *sighed* at me like I asked her to change a tire on my car.  When she came back... she had separated ALL our checks and slammed my to-go drink down in front of me. We did talk to the Manager on Duty about our issues and she said she would look into it and have a talk with our selected staff we had for the evening.  What I didn't understand was why there was such a huge wait of people lined up in their hallways especially when they had TONS of empty tables and booths open.  Personally with the economy being the way it is.... I would think that you (as a waiter/waitress) would want to fill the table for more chances of getting good tips.  I felt like my business was not wanted and they just wanted an empty bar area for the night.  How would  you make money off an empty room dumbfounds me? Just IMO."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  The problem with this place is that nothing is consistent.  Sometimes they totally nail it.  Sometimes the food is off.  Or sometimes you get rotten service.  Even the rules vary from visit to visit: things that you always get will all of a sudden be an \"extra charge\", or drinks suddenly become available by the pitcher only.    When everything is good, this place is great!   But you just can't count on that with every visit."}
{"text":"Came back home to the burgh for a couple of days. Decided to come here cause it was close to the hotel and we were starving. Have been here before and had one bad experience with service, but that was a couple of years ago. Never had any prob with the food. Ordered my dinner, think they called it the texas two step. A few ribs, BBQ chic breast rice and beans. Food was good. Only complaint is that it coulda had some more BBQ sauce on it. This time the service was great. Drinks always full, food served up fast and hot. If anything was needed, their manager was out walking the floor making sure every need was taken care of. Still full."}
{"text":"Find a different text mex place to go. Food came out way too fast and there were fruit flies everywhere. Yuck!"}
{"text":"So we wanted to try somewhere new and landed on Don Pablos- not the best decision we've ever made.  Not the worst, either, but certainly not the best.. or even second, or third, or 10th best.  Anyway, we walked in and the theming I thought was pretty cool.  The fountain in the middle, the decor, the music, I thought it all was pretty good which made me  pretty pumped that we had chosen a good place.  WRONG.  Our server had zero personality.  Our food had zero flavor.  So there was really nothing that made us want to go back.  The prices were good, but as they say, you get what you pay for, which at this place is very little.  The portions were pretty big, but you could give me mountains and mountains of food, and if it doesn't taste good, who cares how much there is?  And speaking of prices, I asked for guacamole and my husband asked for sour cream (who doesn't automatically serve sour cream with EVERy dish at a mexican place, anyway?).. after she forgot my teeny tiny little dish of guac and I had to ask again for, we get the bill and they charged both of us!  The guacamole, I kinda get, but sour cream??  Thats like places that charge for ranch.  What is that about??  Anyway, to sum it all up, if you're looking for low prices and big portions, then this is your place.  But if you're also looking for decent service and food that you actually enjoy, you may want to reconsider.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever experienced. Waitress forgot an order, messed up our check and never refilled drinks. Food was average-typical chain mexican food. Won't go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Don Pablos for years. I grew up in Virginia and would always go with my family. Now, living in Pittsburgh I've gone to this location probably about 10 times. The quality of food as well as the service seems to be getting worse every time I go.  Tonight, my boyfriend and I went for dinner. Right when we walked in, we stood at the host stand patiently for about 5 minutes...After the same employee/server walked by us about 4 or 5 different times, he asked if we've been seen yet - We just politely shook our heads no as he walked away to go get the hostess. After that, it took an additional 3 or 4 minutes for her to come out and actually seat us.  Once we were sat, it took about 5 minutes for our server (Lindsey #561) to come over and introduce herself. We ordered soda and Border Dip. Once the Border Dip came out, it was only warm as though it was waiting in the kitchen for a while. She forgot the tortillas that were suppose to come with it which I brought up to her and she seemed annoyed that I asked for something that was suppose to be included in the appetizer to begin with. Once I got my dinner (Combo - Pick Two) which was two crunchy beef tacos with a side of sour cream, there was so much grease from the taco meat that I didn't even finish one of my two tacos. A puddle of grease covering the entire bottom of my plate - the tacos themselves made me sick. I had to ask for my side of sour cream 3 separate times before she actually went to get it for me. Our server didn't stop by even ONCE to ask us if we needed anything or how our food was. My drink was completely empty for an entire hour and never actually got a refill. The sad part? They weren't even busy. This was the worst service I've ever had. Worst $40 experience for even worse food and service."}
{"text":"The food is especially yummy, some of the best Tex Mex you can get on the East Coast I'm sure. (I'm from Texas.)  The service? Absolutely horrid! I've NEVER had good service at this location and with it's closeness to the PIT airport, I've been here plenty of times. However, the food is the reason I continue to go back - I'm consistent with eating fajitas here and they've never gone wrong. Tender meat, even the steak here is more tender than other places' chicken. If you don't like the prices, try their weekly specials. I know that Wednesday's are $8.99 fajitas, and they have several other pretty good deals."}
{"text":"OK they are a chain, but maybe I have rated them higher because the only other Mexican / tex-mex style restaurant I have tried in Pittsburgh was Mad Mex and compared to them anything has to be better.  Service was fast and efficient and you received good value for your money. One of the highlights was the enchilada sauce. It contained a lot of chili powder and is probably the best chain restaurant enchilada sauce I have ever tasted, outside of chains it's probably in the top 10 and that is saying something since I lived in SoCAL for 30+ years.  Some misses was the chile mashed potatoes, I wasn't forced to order it, but it just doesn't go with the theme. Their tacos are highly Americanized although their tortillas are good. And their steak fajita salad was just fajitas dumped on lettuce and a few accompaniments, not really inventive, but you got what you ordered.  I'm not dying to go back, but the food is much better than the other competitor I already mentioned."}
{"text":"We had a good experience today. They were not very busy so maybe that worked to our advantage. Their carnitas were so fresh. We will definately visit them again."}
{"text":"Don Pablo's is the gift that keeps on giving, and giving, and giving.  You know what I mean.  Food = horrible.  Stale chips, salsa that tastes like ketchup, and more unworthy examples that is wasting both our time.  See the first paragraph above, and repeat it to yourself.  Then, go elsewhere.  You and your unmentioned body parts will thank me tomorrow."}
