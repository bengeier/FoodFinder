{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and do not often write negative reviews but this was truly horrible, horrible service.  Our server was incredibly rude and indifferent (maybe high?) from the start. We got to the restaurant at 5:30, we were a larger table (10 people - most of whom worked or were currently working in food service), but were one of two tables in the restaurant. Our server was flustered from the beginning when we asked for drinks but I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. One of the beers was described as an \"incredibly drinkable\" blonde ale with \"subtle spice\" but ended up having an overwhelming smokey taste, genuinely thought it was either the wrong beer or something was wrong with it. The table drank beer regularly and the consensus was this beer was either mislabeled or the lines needed flushed. When we brought this up to our server he cut my mom off while she was talking and was extremely defensive and rude (did not take it off the check which is whatever). Again, no where in the description did it say it was smokey (but described other beers as smokey). It is obviously not the server's fault that the description didn't match or that we didn't like something but he clearly could have handled it so much better.  We ordered appetizers which were fine but, again, the descriptions did not match the actual foods - listed ingredients were missing or odd things were added. Also he didn't give us plates or silver ware and napkins until a bit after we got our appetizers which was annoying but not unforgivable. We had to wave our server over (never refilled our water) maybe 15 minutes after we got our appetizers so we could order our actual dinner. This is at about 6:35, 6:40 at the latest. Two people also asked for more beers. 15 minutes later no one has gotten another drink and we cannot find the server and several people were out of water. I see him run out of the kitchen at 7 and start punching stuff into the computer. In my head I was like \"there's no way he is just now putting our food in\", he was. I know this because right after he did that he comes over to tell us it might be longer for our food to come because he just sent in \"the big food order\" not because he waited 20 minutes to send it in (he said \"big order\" multiple times which annoyed me). We had to ask twice for drink refills before our food came. When we finally got our food after 7:30, he never asked us how it was or got us drink refills unless we asked him multiple times. I don't think he did anything unless we asked and was super rude about everything. We ended up having to go to the bar for waters -  at the bar were told they \"were busy\" but this was at 7:30 a full two hours after we arrived. Mind you, we did not have any crazy demands or even changes to the dinners we ordered. Minus having to ask multiple times for things we were not difficult, we were literally just a slightly larger table.  It was like pulling teeth trying to get anything from our server.   We were there for 2 and a half hours!! Best part? They included gratuity! This was such a horrible experience every step of the way, what a joke."}
{"text":"A highland square gem, great staff front and back, superb food, wifi,I'm a wine drinker so can't comment on the beers but overall an a-1 place. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I want to like this establishment, however the bad quality of the beer, the service, the dirty draft lines and the extremely rude waitress prohibit me from doing so.  Sadly this \"brewery\" occupies a wonderful location and delivers all the wrong things.  Bad service, the worst beer, and a potent smell of bleach.  Why does it smell like cleaning supplies yet I can tell your draft lines haven't been cleaned!  I thought just your beer was bad, however you taint any guest draft you have!  If I was any of these other breweries I would pull my keg from you as you have shamed them!   I was hoping that the third time you tried opening a brewery that you would have learned from your previous mistakes, I was sorely mistaken.   Please close right away, make way for someone who gives a damn about service, and quality.  I feel my review is in vein, you clearly don't care and have given up... perhaps you have some delusion of grandeur and think you are doing a good job... you are not.  A warning to all others please stay away from this establishment, perhaps thy will close and we will all be in a better place for them closing."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to OBC. Just like our first visit, we were really happy with the service, food and the beers. My husband enjoyed the Steel Valley Stout he selected and my son got the Cardinal Red Ale which he liked as well. Our food was very good. We enjoyed the pretzel bites. The beer cheese soup was great.  My brother-in-law got the pizza with pulled pork which is one of his favorite selections. All six of us enjoyed our food and the service was very prompt. The is definitely one of our favorite places to go when we visit family in Akron."}
{"text":"One of my local spots that I often frequent when I want a good craft beer. The beer is constantly changing and they always have good and new stuff on tap. Unfortunately it stops there. The food menu is mediocre at best and the service is always sub par. The owner always comes up and talks to you when he's there, but he's always drunk."}
{"text":"Ownership has really allowed the current management to run this place into the ground. The wait staff and bartenders were verbally abused by the acting manager the night I was there, and one bartender acting to defend himself was threatened with being fired on the spot. Completely unprofessional behavior by the manager. Will never go back, feel bad for the staff."}
{"text":"J.D. was the bartender and very friendly.  He was able to describe their beers to me which I think is so important.  The food was amazing!!  Fresh and flavorful.  Owners are normally behind the scenes, but I met Chris sitting at the bar.  Super nice and easy to talk to.  I'm from Columbus.  When I'm back in Akron, I'm eating/drinking here!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good....the service is not. Maybe they just need more experienced servers. The waitress had to take our heck back to correct it 3 times."}
{"text":"Went there on whim for beers and food. Service started out ok. Once we were served beers it all went down from there. Staff was way too laid back. When we tried to order food they were out of  menu items. The bartender never checked back with us once we decided on other options. We tried to get his attention and were ignored. We sat there with one empty glass and never asked if we wanted a refill till we asked for the check. Will not be returning. Only thing that was good was the beer."}
{"text":"First and last timers. Unfriendly and  rude service...bartenders seem to give service to the \"regulars\" only. Wanted to stay for another drink until we were asked if \"we were ready for our check yet\"... Instead of \"can I get you another drink\" and Heaven forbid we ask for a napkin with our meal (which they were out of). Their appetizer chips were decent."}
{"text":"Showed up at 6:20, was hoping to see a movie right next door at 7:00. NOPE. Not even close. To say they were slow and unprofessional would be an understatement. Waited 40 minutes for a chicken sandwich, and then they brought out the wrong side with it. Friend ordered pulled pork, they waited 30 minutes to tell him they didn't have pulled pork.. Was a part of a party of 4, each person got their meal at a different time. Extremely frustrating. And to top it off didn't get out of there til 7:30. MISSED MY MOVIE!  Not recommended if you are looking to finish a quick sandwich in under an hour."}
{"text":"It was a ok bar.  I felt the gay bartender was overly enthused with serving & chatting with the gay couple to serve us.  When I drink , I want to drink........"}
{"text":"Really glad my wife and I stopped here for lunch on the drive from Wisconsin to Pittsburgh. My wife is a picky beer drinker, which was no problem as the bartender gave her a sip of several beers before she found \"the one\". Food was fast and hot and tasted great. By the time we left, I think we were introduced to everyone who was on duty. Will be back when in the Akron metropolitan area."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots. Beer is always above average. Food is always solid. Good atmosphere. Good prices. Solid place all around."}
{"text":"The beer is good, the food is good, the service is awful. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the beer and menu, but there was ONE server for the whole place. Two servers minimum in a place like this. There was a busboy and a food runner who spent more time watching the Green Bay Dallas game than anything. An 80 seat casual restaurant shouldn't be running 30+ minute ticket times on simple things like wings and sandwiches. Constantly being told \"their working on it\" isn't good enough. There was at least 7 employees at the time of my visit, but the whole operation seemed totally disorganized. There is a reason I come here only occasionally: great product - if you ever get it."}
{"text":"This place sucks, & I really want it not to.  I'm a beer consultant that has spent my entire career in the restaurant/bar scene and live within walking distance so I'd love a decent brewery.  It isn't.  Their own beer aspires to be mediocre & despite having TONS of guest taps they never have anything good.  The food is fine, not amazing nor terrible, but service is abysmal.  Tonight took 25 minutes for fries and an hour for pizza.  I've been here about 5 times now and I honestly don't know why; there really isn't any reason to go back.  They even had the door open tonight when it's 20 degrees and whiteout/blizzard snowing.  In retrospect, that was their strongest draft..........(Bonus points for cool urinals...?)."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and check out craft beer breweries & tap houses all the time. IPAs are my choice when it come to beer. That being said, Ohio Brewing Co. not that impressive. Still I give them credit for offering several guest beers. Now the food. We ordered several items off the menu. ( 6 of us).  The Greek salad was good. Stew decent as well. Chips, steak sandwich, burger middle of the road. Much better food to be had in this neighborhood. Lastly, yes they have a mini outside area to eat/drink. If you have a party of 5 or more it gets rather tight to sit together.  This place isn't bad. More of a small neighborhood pub for locals who aren't fussy about beer/food."}
{"text":"If you do make it to Ohio Brewery, you must try the Porter! I would go out of my way to grab a beer from here. Relaxed place to go and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good.  They have their own beer ($5) plus an assortment of other beers (6$).  The service is ok no the greatest.  They had to change a keg that night but it seemed that no one really knew how to do that.  The food was ok.  I like the atmosphere and the location of the bar but saying that I probably won't be rushing back there any time soon."}
{"text":"This place opened a few weeks ago, so I'm sure they're still working out the kinks (such as the music... which confused me a bit). I've been here twice and tried a few of their beers (the winter one and the blonde), and really enjoyed them. The pretzels are great. Most importantly, the staff is super friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they are in the square. It's fun. Food is good. Service is friendly.  Great beers. Wish the would offer more ciders. Sometimes they have music."}
{"text":"They need to hire a competent wait staff. We sat at our table for 40 minutes before we got up and left. The place was not at all busy!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday and sign says opening May 2018. Why does web site show it as open? Owners need to get their act together and update website. This goes for all brewery owners. Will not go back again. I gave it one star because I can't vote zero stars!"}
{"text":"It took us forever to get our food and then it was cold. The BBQ sauce they promote tasted like homemade ketchup and my wings were swimming in it. The server could have cared less about us and we had to ask for refills. Not going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner  on Saturday.   Really enjoyed the beer and the service was great!  I had the chicken sandwich it was ok. My wife had the bratwurst that was very good I wish I would have had it.   Nice place when we went it was not crowded.  But the bar was full. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, house beers were a bit odd. Had the cheesesteak, pulled pork, and pretzels between my wife and I. Pretzels are pretty great, would recommend. Server was nice, friendly and sociable."}
{"text":"The beers were really good and the appetizers were awesome. I liked the cardinal beer the best. Parking is across the street. Happy hour everyday til 7. Food does take some time to get."}
{"text":"Stopped in for trivia night so it was pretty packed. Ordered fries and my boyfriend ordered the veggie burger, which he really liked. The fries came with pepper on them, which I was on the fence about. The waitress we had was really nice and despite the room being packed, managed to always navigate her way over to our table at all the right times to check in with us."}
{"text":"I really like to consider myself an optimist, so after I read the reviews on the Ohio Brewing Company (OBC) I wanted to check it out for myself. Sure, there's some good reviews on the OBC, but there's also some negative ones out there too (most being about the service). With an open mind and a empty stomach I decided to see what this place had going on for itself. Well....... I'm happy to say I had nothing but a great experience here. My waitress was genial, fast, and knowledgeable about all the craft beers as well as the food. Now to be fair(as far as the service goes)the place wasn't exactly packed. It was mid-day Saturday and there might have been 30 people or so but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves very much. I even over heard a couple guys raving about the burgers and some of their favorite entrées. As I sipped on some beer samples I decided to order the Beer Cheese Soup, Spicy Hungarian Peppers and a Quinoa Hummus Wrap (so much for the diet). Everything came out hot, fresh, delicious, and in a timely matter. I highly recommend the Spicy Hungarian Peppers, they were kinda amazing! The menu is a decent size but not overwhelming. There's plenty of appetizers featuring Lump Crab Cake, house made Hummus, Bruschetta Trio, Wings and more. They also offer a variety of Pizza's made with fresh dough with spent grain from the brewing process (pretty cool indeed). Tasty burgers, sandwiches, soup and salad and entrées are here also. There are vegetarian and gluten free options as well so fear not!.   I got a pretty good feeling I'll be back to try the Pork Trio Mac N Cheese...Andouille, pulled pork and bacon smothered in beer cheese sauce? Nuff said, I'm all in! The OBC isn't the biggest place, but from what I could tell, the dining area looked to seat around 50 people or so comfortably. There is a small area outside to eat, as well as the bar side. It's a cozy little spot with a nice ambiance. I personally love Highland Square and all the amenities it has to offer which is why I had to give this place a fair crack. Its really unfortunate to see some of the bad reviews. I'm sure OBC from time to time probably does deal with staffing issues just like any other restaurant. Now I'm not trying to make any excuses for the OBC, customers want to enjoy the WHOLE experience, it cant just be about the food, or the beer, or the ambiance. The whole experience also includes a staff that's attentive and enjoys serving. During my visit... ZERO complaints. The food was good, the staff was good, and of course the beer.... good! I'll certainly be coming back and I would recommend giving this place a try.  I especially encourage anyone to give it another chance. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the service is always slow and I have waited a minimum of 45 minutes every time I ordered food."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try after hearing a variety of opinions about the place.  The beer selection was good, with house beers and guest brews.  They have a great happy hour deal, but were out of the items we wanted to try (wings and Hungarian peppers.)  The burger and chicken sandwich tasted good, but took a long time to get to our table. Luckily we were not in a hurry to get anywhere.  No rush to go back."}
{"text":"Really nice staff but the beer was very borderline.   It was clean but seemed to be almost watered down. The hops were less than than expected in most beers especially the IPA.   The stout was at best, a dark ale.  The beers were disappointing across the board."}
{"text":"Had the sausage sandwich. It was good. Beers are good as well. It was quite Friday at lunch time."}
{"text":"Worst beer I have ever had. No aroma, just terrible. Service was awful and no one ever greeted us.  We stood around for 10 minutes without anyone even acknowledging us."}
