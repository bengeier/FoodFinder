{"text":"This restaurant has had a lot of hype. I'll dissent somewhat. On a recent visit I found the food very good but the service - I was seated at the bar - somewhat offhand. I had to ask for bread, and the response was a half slice of decent bread plunked on a small plate. Isn't bread a 'standard feature' of good restos? Also the glass of champagne I had was almost lukewarm. 
Even though it was fairly early, the noise level was already quite high. Not recommended for a quiet or intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allées au restaurant Montreal Plaza dans le cadre de l'enterrement de vie de jeune fille de mon amie. Nous nous attendions à de l'abonné nourriture et un bon service (comme dans la majorité des restaurants de qualité à Montréal). Toutefois, notre soirée à de loin surpassé nos attentes. Nous avons été accueillies par une équipe formidable qui a pris soin de nous et qui nous a traitées comme des reines (avec la courte apparition des serveurs habillés en robe de mariée et robe courte). Thomas nous a servies comme si nous étions des célébrités. Toute l'équipe du restaurant était aux petits soins, vraiment, ça nous a donné le goût de s'établir au Montreal Plaza (préparez-nous la petite salle, on s'en vient tous les jours!). 
Ensuite, la nourriture... Que dire de la nourriture! Elle n'était pas seulement bonne, elle était exquise. Tout était bien balancé, les saveurs explosaient sans en être agressives. Cheryl et son équipe sont des artistes et nous étions honorées de pouvoir déguster leurs créations! 

En gros là... ALLEZ AU MONTREAL PLAZA!"}
{"text":"Very impressive. All the food we had was so amazing. The waiters were very sensitive to food allergies and intolerances."}
{"text":"Accueil hyper chaleureux on nous offre l'apéro parce que nous inaugurons leur nouvelle terrasse. Le menu découverte à 80$ est une véritable aventure de saveurs. Ambiance décontractée mais avec un service de qualité Toqué! 
Charles-Antoine Crête a créé un endroit familial et rassembleur, hétéroclite aussi, avec atelier, serre et autres curiosités.
Superbe soirée on y retourne sans faute pour les petites et grandes occasions, en amoureux ou avec les petits!"}
{"text":"Extraordinaire neo brasserie. Creative food but respecting the taste and the tradition. Great atmosphere. Must go restaurant !"}
{"text":"Quelle merveilleuse soirée nous avons passé dans ce chaleureux restaurant. Les plats étaient délicieux (mention spéciale aux choux de Bruxelles frits présentés de manière très originale mais surtout succulents!) et le service irréprochable. Les prix sont assez accessibles pour une nourriture d'une telle qualité. C'est de toute évidence un endroit où j'aurai grand plaisir à retourner."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience.  Friendly service.  Excellent food.  Portions were filling.  Well worth the $20 cab ride from downtown hotel.  Very safe neighborhood.  Felt like we were guests in someone's home.  The owner was welcoming, kind and even helped track down a cab for us to get back downtown afterwards.  Will definitely return next time we return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Montreal Plaza was such a delight.  We were a group of 12 people from NYC, SF, and Boston who all have a very high standard when it comes to food/service, and the restaurant really surpassed expectations.  They not only accommodated us when we were late, they also got us out by a tight time frame to get to our next stop of the night.  The service was spot on: the waiters/waitresses were attentive and the sommelier was highly knowledgeable of wines that were esoteric.  

In regards to the food, very delicious.  It was a mix of beautifully executed food with a modern twist to French type food.  It's very difficult to serve food for a large group on a timely basis and well, and Montreal Plaza was able to do it.  The presentation was also superb.  I can't say enough good things about this place and I've eaten at a lot of nice places in NYC.  I'd definitely come here again when I'm visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing experience given the hype. I think we expected a lot more of this place. Ordered the tasting menu ($80) and frankly expected a little more. A couple things that were a let down:

-Dessert was a little bland and very hard to share. We were a group of 6. It made more sense for a couple to share but not so much for a larger group.
-It looks like they forgot to bring us one plate (Brussels sprouts) with main dish (meat assortments). We've noticed it after we had our dessert as all other tables that ordered the tasting menu had it. It's surprising that a restaurant of this caliber would have such a \"faux pas\".
-main dish which consisted of multiple meat and fish pieces could have offered slightly enough pieces for each member in the party to try one. For instance, there was small meatballs but it had to be shared. It would make more sense to have a small piece of each meat sample than to have to share those small pieces. It's not like the meat pieces were large.

For having done many tasting menus and shareable menus at other reputable restaurants, we've all found this one to be rather disappointing. We all felt like we didn't get our money's worth. It obviously doesn't help when they forgot to bring us one of the plates."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the level of noise is extremely high. We enjoyed the food but at the end we just couldn't bear the noise from other tables - we could hardly hear each other when talking. It's a pity such a great and delicious menu be ruined by noise levels."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. We got the chef's table off in a small room to the side of the dining room, and it was an excellent experience. The wait staff was incredibly attentive, the drinks were creative and delicious, and the food was quite imaginative and extremely well made. The best way to experience this resaturant is to get many small plates to share with a group and try them all."}
{"text":"Excellent! Succulent! Une vrai explosion de saveurs dans la bouche

Portions de type tapas! Prendre 3 plats minimum - portions malheureux petites pour le prix

Excellent resto!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place (Montreal Designer Zebulon Perron) amazing chefs (previously at Toqué). Very fresh and tasty food. The place is packed, brightly light, and the noise level is up there. Plates are original, and vey well prepared. Delicious food, for a price. Service is very attentive. The only little caveat is that we were asked too many times if our plates were finished.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Super équipe, super cuisine. Beyond expectations. Tout était excellent. On a vraiment aimer notre experience. Les plats était bien interprété. On y retournes n'importe quand pour l'ambiance, le service, la deco et absolument pour la cuisine."}
{"text":"On our first night in Montréal we were lucky enough to end up here just a block away from where we were staying. We both went into this restaurant knowing nothing about it and we were both pleasantly surprised. We started off with the salmon and sturgeon nigiri which was easily the best dish of the night. The combination of raw fish with the smoky sturgeon was perfect. The cavatelli pasta was perfectly cooked, very fresh, and went perfectly with the duck confit and vegetables. We also got a whelk dish and raw sea urchin. Both were prepared to perfection and beyond delicious. Overall this was an excellent start to our trip here in Montréal and one of the best modern restaurants at which I have ever had the pleasure to eat."}
{"text":"Venez vous réchauffer ici. Le seul restaurant que je connaisse qui marie tartare et huîtres. Qui m'apporte de l'eau chaude pour que je puisse allonger mon café à mon goût. Ne quittez pas sans avoir essayé le \"chopped liver.\" Je vous souhaite de tomber sur notre hôtesse, horticultrice  de l'endroit... Désolé pour le biais, c'est ici que j'ai célébré mon 50e. Bon succès!"}
{"text":"If you aren't familiar w St. Hubert Plaza you will be caught by surprise to find this great resto in a strip mall popular for bridal boutiques and bizarre costume/wig stores etc. It's a strange place to open a high end restaurant. But once you get past that, you are in for a great dining experience. 

The restaurant interior is beautiful. Felt like we were in Paris. Food was amazing. My husband said the razor clams were the best dish he's had in years. My scallop ceviche with tangerine were also great. The Brussels sprouts were delicious. Cons: Was not a fan of the fennel salad. Service was on the slow side.

Highly recommend trying it. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"exceptional ingredients, tons of creativity and restraint, warm and easy-going service
beautiful, memorable food 

sat at the bar, got to check out action in the open kitchen.

-yellow tomato soup with crab, melon, aromatic olive oil- balanced, elegant
-fried zucchini blossoms filled with duck ragout and goat cheese- decadent, a curious mix of Italy and Montreal. loved the crisp tender baby squash still attached to the flower.
-blue fin tuna belly, grilled with red wine sauce, strawberries, fennel, crisp mushrooms- loved this ode to the mineral blood of the fish. gorgeous
-rhubarb sorbet, rhubarb soup, pickled rhubarb, butter cookies, chantilly creme- not too sweet, so refreshing, elegantly plated

this was my first trip to montreal and I felt welcomed with this meal, lots of talent in the Montreal food scene, and it seems this is the hub."}
{"text":"Top 5 best restaurants in Montreal hands down.
If this place was in New York, it would be impossible to get in.

Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with my cousin and her husband. It is an eclectic spot - hints of upscale while an over-sized stuffed Elmo hangs from the wall (as does an upside-down dollhouse from the ceiling). I started with a Cider and then my cousin and I split a glass of wine (yes, they will do that for you!). For food, they recommended 2-3 plates per person. I tried a bite of the venison tartare and crispy and the pork skewer - both were good. I ordered the polenta and Saucisson and rib eye beef skewer. The polenta was melt-in-your-mouth delicious with prosciutto and watermelon on top. The beef was fine - presented well, but I preferred the polenta. Really great homemade bread with butter brought to the table as well. For dessert, we tried the special frozen yogurt and the fudge. Both were nice. All in all, a good experience - I would say I'm a fan for sure!"}
{"text":"What a fun place!!! Super cool staff...and the food...top 7 in Montreal for sure. 

We have done all the $$$$$ Downtown, Griffintown, Old Port, Mile End Restaurants...never I would have come on St Hubert to expect such precise execution of flavours and colours in a delightful bliss.

Salmon Tartare + scallops as entrees : 9.5/10
Cavatelli, with foie gras + Salmon as main 8.8 (cavatelli dough a bit too rough, otherwise 9.5);

Desserts, just pick any 9.5 (minimum) for all.

Champagne and white wine to wash all this down...a bit pricy, but goes with the territory.

Wonderful night. Such a good time we had.

Keep up the good work Plaza Montreal."}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé le menu dégustation à 80$ ! Ce menu correspond a 3 services salés (de deux ou trois petites assiettes ) et a un service sucrée ! Tous les plat etait très bon, mais j'ai vraiment eu un coup de coeur pour la viande a partager de la semaine qui etait de la caille ! 


Je pense vraiment que le montreal plaza est une experience a essayer. Par contre, les prix sont vraiment vraiment très élevés, je dirais meme trop élevés !"}
{"text":"Tres belle déco. Musique très forte comme dans un bar, du hiphop, du disco, c'est bien mais la clientèle a la 50taine..  donc ca ne fit pas vraument. La bouffe est tres bonne, très fraiche, le vin très bon. L'addition pas necessairement si chère."}
{"text":"Un réel plaisir!  J'y retournerai sans faute.  Sans défaut, la perfection.  Décor 5 , service 5  et qualité au delà de l'imagination.  Le chef, a même pris le temps de nous saluer et nous remercier en quittant.  Cette expérience culinaire restera graver dans mes souvenirs pour longtemps!

Merci!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday dinner here at the recommendation of a fellow yelp elite (thanks Konstantina!) and the place did not disappoint.  We booked the private room (the \"bureau\").  If you book this room, fyi it seats 8 comfortably and 10 if you don't mind being a little squished. We took the tasting menu, they have three price points, $60, 80 or 100 per person.  We chose the $80 option and were very satisfied with the value.  They are very good about taking dietary requests into account.  We were one of \"those\" groups, with a vegetarian, a preggo, and someone with several food intolerances, but they accommodated us all without difficulty.  

Decor is fun and funky, music was on point, service was fantastic, food was amazing.  It was my birthday, so there was a lot of very good wine involved, so no pictures and the details of the meal are honestly a little hazy.  We got to try about 7-8 different plates including dessert, and they were all fabulous.  

It's a little pricy for a regular visit, but an amazing spot for special occasion dinner.  The location is a little odd, on a strip of St Hubert street surrounded by prom dress shops, but absolutely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! But you need to make your reservation in advance. The brussel sprouts were outstanding, and so were the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Montreal Plaza is legit.

Mind blown.  I almost want to go and take a star off of all other reviews I ever written and then add one more to this to show just how superb it is.  You have just given my favorite restaurant some fierce competition.

Flavor combinations that will make your taste buds sing and dance.  Perfectly executed dishes all around; the gnocchi was amazing, spot on and the beans were cooked just perfectly bringing out the most bright and delicious fresh flavor married with the butter and the almonds, my god.  Each dish was elegantly presented and executed perfectly.  The wine list of course hit a high mark along with cocktails and the service, though constricted slightly by our inability to speak French the service was superb.

Added bonus to the experience was when Alex the manager came by, introduced himself, asked about our experience and thanked us for coming.  His sentiment was genuine and his kindness was notable. 

Montreal Plaza is a true representation of passion and love for cuisine, beverage and quality.  The efforts here are intended and truly out shine many that strive to be the same caliber.  Their operation is calculated while feeling refined with a sense of ease and a casual, welcoming vibe.  I also have to mention that the ambiance, fostered by a simple, but classy aesthetic and fine tuned lighting is PERFECT.  I was in love from the moment I walked in the door. I am looking forward to my next Montreal Plaza experience as well as sharing it with others who travel to Montreal."}
{"text":"My second night out in Montreal, and this spot was recommended to me from a friend that visits Montreal often from New York. So, I knew it had to be good.

I booked online, and since I was traveling by myself was happy to sit at the bar. Both bartenders were exceptional. Knew the food menu inside/out, made incredible drinks, and were super friendly. 

Each dish I ordered was fresh, seasonal, and on-point. Not one miss here at Montreal Plaza. But, it's certainly not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here. Had it not been for one bland dish, I would gladly have given Mtl plaza 4 stars. I love how the restaurant was spacious and classy yet casual. It was almost a full night but you never would have noticed from the excellent service you got.

Food-wise, we ordered the sea urchin cream with artic char, whelks au gratin, radish cannelloni with pb sauce, hamachi tartare and chicken liver mousse. We loved everything except the cannelloni. Instead of pasta, we got rolls of thinly sliced radish drenched in peanut butter sauce. I thought the dish was very average,  and highly contrasted with the other plates which were extremely well-seasoned and tasty. The whelks really stood out. They were buried under a mountain of crispy panko and garlic herb butter- just what I needed before a week of holiday feasting ;)

The menu seems to change often- lots of Yelpers were raving about the brussel sprouts in their reviews but they were already off the menu when I went a few days ago. All the more reason to come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in plaza st hubert so when you look at the directions it is indeed the right place. For an excellent restaurant the location is unusual.  I went here with a group of 10 for a birthday and we were in a private room. The room had really interesting decor that matched the rest of the restaurant. It has a great atmosphere.   The service staff is friendly and courteous - they checked with us about dietary restrictions since we had the tasting menu - they accommodated everyone.  The food was excellent - everyone raved all night about their food - both for taste and presentation.  We had the 80$ tasting menu (there is a 100$ option) and ordered wine as well. This restaurant has apparently been there for two years - if our experience is indicative they will be there many more..."}
{"text":"Great dining room. Eclectic and interesting decor, the space exudes charm and is warm and welcoming. The staff was courteous and attentive. Menu was extremely creative and varied. We were 4 to dine and shared 8 plates as well as a dessert. The razor clams and yakitory stood out to me as clear favorites. Everything was delicious and well prepared. Excellent experience overall and would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner here. We had a group of eight, went a la carte, and ordered a bunch of stuff to share:

- Zucchini flowers (2x)
- Saucisson + melon
- Sea urchin (2x)
- Razor clam
- Beef tartar
- Yakitori (3x)
- Lobster + bone marrow
- Fish tartar (2x)
- Meat tartar (venison)

Plus desserts:

- Blue meringue
- Fruits puff pastry for two
- Frozen cake

I can't say there was a single thing we didn't like (we ate every last bite of every dish), but our absolute favorites were the fish tartar, sea urchin (you basically drink it out of a glass), and yakitori (basically lettuce wraps with huge chunks of game meat inside). I personally also loved the razor clam, and the blue meringue (basically blue cheese + meringue) was so weird and so good. 

This was our first meal in Montreal, but really felt like we got an authentic experience here -- this is different kind of food than you'd typically find back home in New York, and all so good. This will definitely be on my list of places I'd like to come back to next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Love love love the atmosphere. So cute. The place is a little farther away from the downtown area, over 2 miles. It is located on a cute street full of shops. My boyfriend and I shared the tuna sandwich which was amazing and unique, vegetables and charcuterie ( veggies were all fresh and unique, not over cooked with oil), oysters,  whelk and butter with fried bread (delicious!!! The butter and garlic was so good I wanted to lick up all of it), tomato and herbs (I feel like their was tuna in the middle but it didn't say on the menu, this was so fresh and a definite must of you love tomatoes), and for dessert we got a raspberry tart with chocolate mouse (the dessert was tasty but small, we saw a lot tastier desserts floating around). I also ordered a rose cocktail drink that was light and tasty. Perfect if you don't want a heavy cocktail. The staff was very sweet. While I was waiting outside for my boyfriend, one of the employees came outside to put some thing away and he didn't even help us and he said he hopes I have a good night. I thought that was so nice to be friendly when he didn't need to be. He then took a picture of my boyfriend and I Infront of the restaurant that looked perfect. Our first picture together all trip! He seemed so genuine and nice and made us feel special. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Every thing was great. Gotta try the chop liver. I was told that they change their manu from time to time, for sure will come back for different dishes. We all enjoyed."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this place with my girlfriends upon our friends recommendation. Apparently, it was the new \"it\" place to go enjoy a nice dinner in montreal nowadays.

Our experience was very disappointing for the following reasons. Before I list what went wrong, let me just say that the place is GORGEOUS, SPACIOUS (except for the restrooms) and surprisingly, somewhat \"kids-friendly\" for \"fine dining\".

What went wrong:

1) SERVICE - friendly staff, BUT lack of attention to detail: our waiter was not very present, when he was present, it felt rushed. The other staff member that presented our dishes pointed fingers too closely to our food, almost touching it. Overall, service could have been better. Missing the finesse that a place like that calls for.

2) CULINARY EXPERIENCE - We ordered the tasting menu and a mousse de volaille + foie gras to share. The mousse was delicious!!! Super smooth and delicious. Note - this was extra and was not part of the tasting menu. The tasting menu was disappointing. We thought that it was over seasoned - a tad too salty - and personally, there was too many herbs thrown in each dish for me - lacking the balance and finesse I was expecting from a place with this tenure [ex Toqué chef].  DESSERT - with the tasting menu, we were offered 3 desserts - 3 different variation of sorbet/ice cream. Although it was good (not great), we felt like there was a lack of effort, since it would have been nice to get at least one pastry or something different. 

3) THE DETAILS (or lack thereof) - There was a dead mosquito in our water glass. (not cool!) AND there was some weird yellow residue in our wine glass .... 

4) THE RESTROOMS - There was a LONG line in the restrooms... because there are only 2 single toilets for the whole restaurant (huge restaurant)! And the restrooms are somewhat mismatched with the rest of the decor - because it was very \"simple\", a bit dirty and missing the \"wow\" factor to be consistent with the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate our 40th anniversary with Chef Charles-Antoine Crête and his creative, energetic geniuses. From the first drink to the last dessert of the dinner for two every single dish dazzled us. As New Yorkers we have a plethora of fine dining yet we have never experienced such inventive and delicious meal. The chef and his team are fun and fabulous. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I got the chance to try this new place on my last trip to Montreal.  Simple words don't do the menu justice, the food is THAT good.  Great variety, playful flavors, and presentation.   The cuisine is based on smaller plates that are easy to share.  I went with my fiancee, and we enjoyed a whelk dish, prepared like a substitute to escargot, which was incredibly tasty.  Also had fried brussell sprouts that were simply amazing, braised pork, and tuna tartare which was the freshest I've had.  The service is equally as wonderful as the menu.  From the host to the bartender and the servers, everyone was incredibly warm and welcoming.  Eager to answer questions about the menu and offer suggestions.  And I must compliment whoever designed the restaurant itself.  The moment you walk in the vibe is bright and cheerful, which also adds to the experience.  Perfect atmosphere, whether you are looking to have a few drinks with a friend, a dinner date, or for a big dinner celebration.  Altogether, a very memorable experience and I hope we will be back again in the near future!"}

Restaurant très à-la-mode-Crète-Zebulon, validé par Laprise. Prix élevés, malgré un environnement glauque. Niveau sonore: seules voix entendues, votre propre voix intérieure et celle du voisin de gauche par ailleurs très fan de l'endroit. Service totalement à la hauteur.

{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading about its opening on Eater and chef Charles Antoine's new project.  I was able to make reservations online at 9pm and it was still packed when we arrived.

The set up had a few communal tables and  a dessert table on display which had that country feel as well as some booths and tables for 2 and 4 if you wanted a more intimate setting.  

Friday was definitely packed with a mix of older groups and younger couples.  It's definitely a loud atmosphere and in the beginning of our meal, it was interesting they were playing electronica music that was a bit too loud to hold a conversation but eventually the music died down towards around 10pm.

My friend and I started out with glasses of wine however, there were definitely bottles to be purchased. We ordered three courses and as we waited for our dishes we were served with bread and butter.

The plates were definitely about art and presentation which makes it more fun. The most memorable dish was the broccoli on cob.  The dish was huge but eating it was fulfilling even though it's considered a \"light dish.\"

They still need to iron out a few kinks since we waited a long time for the last two dishes. They both came out at the same time so it felt rather rushed.  If the dishes were spaced out evenly in between, I felt it would have been a flawless execution.  We'll see what they will have in store in their 6 month and one year mark.  I am looking forward to more innovative surprises at Montreal Plaza"}
{"text":"Wonderful country decor in a part of town that I had never been, St. Hubert.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating for my large party. Ordered the tasting menu and everything was great."}
{"text":"They have a changing menu with several side orders to share. I would suggest to choose the 80$ sharing one.
The first time I cam it was a bit loud, I chose 2 plates that I didn't enjoy.
The second time I came with a large group of people, for a special occasion, they accommodated us. We asked them to lower the sound of the speakers and ordered the sharing menu, I was surprised; it was great! Food was savory and generous, we were all full. The restaurant's decoration is nice and the chef is creative!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite spots in Montreal! After a third visit, I can say that the food, the wine, the service, the vibe, and the venue, are all consistently amazing every time! 

Firstly, the venue is just gorgeous! A mix of modern, classy elegance, and touches of rustic pub. The long marble bar as you enter the restaurant sets the tone till you catch glimpses of toys and corky decor pieces; the pub style chairs and rustic long windows add country charm to the space. 

The food is just delicious! The menu includes daily specials of seasonal and fresh produce as well as their set menu of everything from salads to pasta and meats. We shared a multiple of plates including oysters, fried zucchini blossoms, salad, razor clams, and a duck and tuna main with greens, vegetables including beets and peppers; everything was beautifully executed, nicely presented and so flavourful. 

The service from start to finish was perfect; our waiter was friendly and engaging, and helpful with helping us choose our dishes and wine. 

The feel of the place with its varied clientele and  90s music in the background, gives off a laidback feel to a chic space where you can share a great meal over an amazing selection of wine and still feel like you're at home. 

I honesty can't say enough about this place; this restaurant has set the bar high for any other restaurant in Montreal providing a menu and venue that is fantastic and accessible to all; kudos to the infamous chef and his staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Beautiful ambiance, relaxed and cosy. Can't wait to come back. 

The food was astoundingly good form the entrées to deserts and the staff was very friendly and professional. 

A truly unique chef and restaurant. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am assuming that if you are going to dine at this St Hubert spot by some of Montreal's most reputable food wizards, Toqué! folks Charles-Antoine Crête, Cheryl Johnson et Sébastien Blanchette, you are in the mood to spend 15$ to 22$ for each small sharing plate during a meal where you should probably order 3 per person to be full. With drinks and dessert you're looking at $100+. I just want to put that right at the top, because if you are thinking, hey let's grab a lovely chill meal at these picnic tables on St Hubert! Then you might have the wrong price point in mind and be shocked. 

That being said, the food, service and vibe are world class. We sat outside and it was lovely, but I do think I'd prefer to be inside next time, it's such a fun, joyful, classy but high-spirited atmosphere in there, it feels amazing. Plus fewer pigeons.

We just went for a couple drinks and bites, on a whim since we were able to get a table outside without a reservation. We shared the stuffed zucchini blossoms (which were like crazy crazy good) and the okonomiyaki and the zucchini with blueberries. 

The okonomiyaki was made with fresh corn and chanterelles, which were lovely, but the portion was so small and thin I found it disappointing compared with other versions I've had of this usually-heart-warming dish. The zucchini with blueberries were super interesting and playful, tiny sweet zucchini, tart fat berries all hot and in an oil with rock salt - tasty but in a kind of weird way, which I love. I like being surprised by food, especially vegetarian dishes. 

The cocktails were delicate and perfect, I would love to go back and try every single one. 

And the service was exceptional. Attentive, friendly, welcoming, personable, and yet managing to give the feeling of a special occasion, up-market experience. Some of the best service I've ever had in Montreal. 

All in all, we had a magical moment here. But we spent about $50 each and went home still sober and still hungry, so personally I will just keep this place in mind for vurry vurry special events."}
{"text":"Un mot; ordinaire! Serveur absent. Snob et sans service. Vraiment la dernière fois que je mets les pieds là."}
{"text":"Wow.  So very tasty. The tasting menu was incredible. The bone marrow octopus appetizer was one of the greatest thing I've ever eaten. Razor clams were also incredible. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ça faisait TRÈS longtemps que nous attendions un restaurant de qualité dans ce secteur de Rosemont. Enfin, il est arrivé! Et pas n'importe lequel, le bébé de Charles-Antoine Crête, vedette, produit du Toqué! 

Nous l'avons essayé au jour 3. Voici nos constats :
- Surpris, ce n'est pas présentation gastronomique, mais bistro/taverne
- Créatif, beaucoup d'intrigue, il faut y retourner 
- Le service est EXCEPTIONNEL
- Plateau de la mer, une fortune pour la quantité, mais super au goût
- Carpaccio, les tranches (très minces) débordent de l'assiette et recouvrent une montagne de légumes marinés, mayonnaise et de gros morceaux de parmigiano, à essayer
- Bourgots, recouvert de légumes finement hachés avec son jus, fantastique
- Seule déception : cerf et calmar, c'est en réalité une salade et on s'y perd, on fini par chercher le cerf et les tranches de calmar.

C'est honnêtement super sympathique! Une réussite complète."}
{"text":"Montreal Plaza is totally the future. The space has been beautifully renovated by Montreal Top Restaurant designer Zebulon Perron. The feel is very French Bistro with its black paneled windows, high ceilings and white walls and frosted glass lighting fixtures which run the length of the restaurant. The room is a mix of furniture from banquettes, wooden tables and chairs, even picnic tables for larger groups and private rooms. Montreal Plaza is very popular with the in crowd, yet the restaurant is not pretentious or snobby. Service is impeccable, respectful and very accommodating. The food is exceptional and creative; they serve classic French bistro fare with fresh, local market cuisine at its best. The wine list contains lots of private imports and is carefully selected with dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Ça faisait longtemps qu'on voulait l'essayer, et ça nous a pas déplu du tout! Le restaurant est super beau, mais la bouffe, wow! Nous avons vraiment bien mangé! Nous avons pris le menu dégustation de 4 services, trois salés et un sucrés. Le premier service venait avec trois plats dont des moules cuites servies sur glace avec une sauce... à tomber par terre! C'était IN-CRO-YABLE. Le deuxième service était composé d'une huître géante gratinée avec bacon et des bourgots gratinés. J'ai, encore une fois, adoré! Le repas principal venait dans une assiette surélevée et c'était de la caille. Eh bien, je ne croyais pas dire ça un jour, mais c'est de loin l'un des meilleurs plats qu'on m'a servi au restaurant. Je ne suis pas une adepte de caille, je trouve qu'il n'y a jamais assez de viande dessus, mais là.. WOW! D'abord, on nous sert la caille au complet, avec coeur et rognon. Ensuite, la sauce est juste formidable! Bref, un gros gros coup de coeur ! 

Le seul hic que j'ai trouvé, et c'est super personnel, le prix est vraiment élevé. C'est 80$ par personne. Bien que je ne doute aucunement de la qualité des produits, j'ai l'impression qu'on peut manger aussi bien pour moins cher ailleurs! Aussi, je doute que nous aurions autant adoré notre expérience si nous n'avions pas pris le menu dégustation... Donc c'est à vous de voir ;)! 

Je suis tout de même ravie de mon expérience et je le recommande fortement :) !"}
{"text":"One of the most unique restaurants I've ever been to - there is a spinning doll house hanging from the ceiling, and an in-house stop animation studio, and a swinging pendulum. We sat in the street and a crazy employee kept running outside to yell into his phone - he turned out to be the head chef. Delicious multi-course meals that left me satiated and wanting to return soon for more. The atmosphere was so surreal it reminded me of the book Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer."}
{"text":"Montreal Plaza is a relative newcomer being open less than 1 year at this point. Located within the Plaza St. Hubert, a beautiful partially covered stretch of streets home to 400 various businesses. We stopped in on a Monday night, since many worthwhile restaurants in Montreal are closed. It proved to be an excellent choice.

It was a beautiful night so we chose to sit outside on the many picnic tables - seating could be a bit communal on a packed night, but we had one all to ourselves. We selected a rose wine and the waiter brought out the bottle to show us and allowed us to try it, which was cool. Our server went over the entire menu, which was vast. We had some choices in mind, and were ready to order then he mentioned they have tasting menus at different tiers - we went with the $80/person with the thought we would be served featured items. 


Our only request were oysters and we received some delicious ones along with two tartares one with scallops the other venison to compare and contrast. Both good, my wife unexpectedly preferred the venison. Next up was the tomato + herbs, which was a sliced tomato reconstructed with greens and dressing which simply tasted like glorious summer. The shrimp sandwich came with this. The fried shrimps were perfectly fried, but I thought this dish was a bit of a miss with the shrimps being on the smaller side and not a fan of the thin fried \"bread\".

The next and final course was the poultry for two that was an incredible platter of perfectly cooked, amazingly delicious chicken with whelks and various roasted vegetables. A slightly sweet sauce with peas and strawberries were poured over as it was served. A strawberry dessert finished off the night.

I am glad we did the tasting menu because it was items we would not have selected otherwise. I was hoping it would have been smaller samples of more dishes. My only criticism is that it would have been less expensive to order each of these items individually and it also made for a long dinner. The waiter was cool and gave us the bottle price for our wine when we hit 5 glasses - so it worked out.

I would recommend this place - especially with a group because there are so many dishes meant to be shared. The service and food here is top notch. For us it was an fantastic introduction to the way they do things in Montreal and I must say, Montreal Plaza does it right!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a big deal. I wish there was something negative or constructive to say but really I can't think of anything. The food is amazing, menu always offers super fresh and delicious seafood, veggies, and other delicious stuff to try. The prices are decent considering the great quality of what is served. I went a few times and one of my favorited was with a group for my birthday. They offered a tasting menu which allowed us to try a bit of everything - highly recommended ! The staff is always friendly and very playful, everything there is an absolute homerun. You must try this place !"}
{"text":"Une néo-brasserie un peu trop prétentieuse à notre goût. Ils misent beaucoup plus sur le concept et le visuel que sur le contenu et la quantité. 
Le plat de viande pour 2 (longe de porc car plus de magret de canard) à 52$ ne vaut clairement pas son prix.
1ère (et dernière) visite bien décevante."}
{"text":"My two friends took me here for my birthday. We each had the tasting menu which was $80/pp and consisted of eight shared plates plus two desserts. Please note that you do not get to pick what dishes you get served but the popular items on the menu do seem to be included. I left the restaurant feeling full and very satisfied. We each had one drink. I had the tequila Caesar. It was smokey and rimmed with steak spice. One friend had a cider and another had the Simon cocktail which was made of bourbon and pear juice with a cute little pear on top. The cocktails were very good. My only complaint was that there was a little too much ice in the cocktails . 

We started with the cold tomato soup. For starters I don't like cold soup. For me soup has to be warm and there cant be fruit in it!  The soup had chunks of tuna, fruits (blueberries, raspberries) and vegetables (tomato, broccoli, zucchini). It was very pretentious. My friends and I were worried that we made a mistake coming here but after the soup it got a lot better. We had the beef tartare + razor clam, sea urchin + tuna, venison tartare, and the tempura zucchini flowers. The tartares were very good. The tuna tartare had spicy mayo and rice crispies in it with blueberries on the side. The tempura came with a creamy white and green sauce. It was delicious!!! Inside the zucchini flower there was duck!! Then we had the beef done two different ways. One dish consisted of beef cubes cooked medium rare with mushrooms and potatoes and the second was braised beef in a dark sauce with strawberries. We then proceeded to have the whelk gratin with miso butter which resembled escargots in cheese and garlic with bread. The waiter told us to really squeeze out all the lime onto the gratin and so we did but then I found that the lime was a bit overpowering and probably would have been better without it or with very little of it. 

For dessert we had a deconstructed cake. We were told it was sponge cake but it was more of an angel cake. It was fluffy and sweet. It included three scoops of raspberry sorbet and one scoop of cantaloupe sorbet. My friends loved, loved, loved the cantaloupe sorbet!! Besides the sorbet there was also strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. The second dessert was rhubarb sorbet with shortbread cookies, slices of rhubarb and strawberries. It was our least favorite dessert. It was very bitter. The rhubarb sorbet would have been better served as a palate cleanser rather than as a dessert.
 
Because it was my birthday,  the staff came out with a huge squash and put two sparklers on top. They came out and sang and wished me happy birthday which was  very nice.

Overall the restaurant felt very homey. The decor is very old school... dolls, and antique looking furniture. A lot of their dishes had tuna , fruits and fennel in it. 

Each dish was beautifully presented. 

I would have given Montreal Plaza five stars had it not been for the cold tomato soup."}
{"text":"This is a true gourmet experience in every way possible. The atmosphere was very chill and relaxed. The service staff were extremely professional and pleasant. The food was amazing. My wife and I had the five course set. The food was delicious and the portions are very large. This was really an aging experience and we will be back. A true treasure of Montreal."}
{"text":"Run don't walk to eat here. Unbelievable food. I had the fall vegetables which was delicious, the polenta with sausixision (with mozzerella balls inside) was so delicious words can't do it justice, and for dessert the crispy  fruits (Cranberry jam at bottom, white chocolate mouse, merange, fruit chips,and sorbet ) just melted in sheer pleasure in my mouth. I may come tomorrow it's so good!"}
{"text":"To enter a restaurant is to enter the mind of the chef, to experience what he or she wished you to experience - and I'm not just talking about the food. The influence of the chef is seen in all aspects of their restaurants - it is the subtle elements of decor, music and atmosphere that make David McMillan and Fred Morin's cool ode to rustic Quebec in Joe Beef work. Same goes for Chuck Hughes and Danny Smiles and the hip coolness of Garde Manger and Bremner or the friendly neighbourhood British pub feel for Derek Dammmann's Maison Publique. There are many examples across Montreal but the key is that the restaurants feel as though they are uniquely from the chefs that run them. We are spoiled in Montreal to have so many wonderful and unique chefs. The challenge is simply to experience all of them!

For the occasion of our anniversary, I decided to bring my girlfriend to Plaza St-Hubert of all places to visit a restaurant that seemed to have the right level of finesse with that wonderful unique element that I love so much about Montreal.... in this case, from the mind of Charles-Antoine Crete, Montreal Plaza.

Started up by Crete and his partner Cheryl Johnson, Montreal Plaza is Crete's first big project since he left Toque where he was Normand Laprise's right-hand man. The restaurant, designed by Zébulon Perron, is quite the space. Equal combination fancy bistro and family chalet. You are wowed by the white-painted bean-board walls and ceiling, the frosted-glass lighting across the ceiling, the marble bars and the open kitchen but then you are amused by the old grandfather clock, the teddy bear, the upside down doll house and by-plane used on the ceiling fans, the greenhouse and the \"workshop\" space. The bathroom area has one of those light-up nature frames with nature sounds on the ceiling! The space is bemusing but wonderful all the same time. The music the whole night was 90s rap and hip-hop so my girlfriend and I spent the night singing along to Nelly, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg and R Kelly. I can only imagine how weird that contrast could be some but for a couple of 20-somethings, it was a awesome element to our evening.

We must start with the drinks as the beer list had the Anna from Hill Farmstead brewery in Vermont. For those who known about beer, you understand how exciting that was.... and how great of a Honey Ale it was. I'd had been wanting to visit the brewery and try one of their beers for a while now. This was a very pleasant surprise to start our evening. For the rest of you, I encourage you to check them out if ever you have a chance.

Foodwise, we decided to start with something neither of us had tried before: sea urchin. In this case, grilled sea urchin served with lardon, green onions and fried shallots within its shell. Beautiful presentation and lovely taste. The urchin was firm at first but then melted in the mouth - rich and creamy sweetness. The addition of the lardon and the shallots added a hint of smokiness as well. A awesome first try at Uni.

Our second starter was salmon tartar + crispy - a lovely slightly creamy salmon topped with lettuce and puffed rice as the crunch to the dish. The fish texturally was beautiful and tender. The binder of the tartar provided some richness and a touch of bite to the dish. The use of the rice for some texture was creative and added some crunch.

We were feeling adventurous with our mains. Our first was blood sausage and apple - served with a jus de viande, lettuce, onion rings and some fresh cranberries. The sausage was wonderful - rich and savoury. The sweetness of the apple and the tartness of the cranberries paired very nicely. The onion rings were a weird add to the plate but the combination of their sweetness and their crunch made them a surprisingly perfect addition.

Our second main was equally as unique in its combinations - sliced deer heart and calamari served with red cabbage, red onion, hay and popcorn. The play between the gamey deer and the fishy tender calamari was pretty interesting although I wished they had been a bit more deer in the plate. The popcorn was another fun play for texture and some sweetness.

Once we got to dessert, my girlfriend wasn't that hungry so she only ordered one of their Cannelés. Nice hint of vanilla and rum with a fluffy interior and nice crust on the outside. An excellent pastry. I, on the other hand, went with the glacé aux pommes cake - layers of frozen apple and cake sliced very thinly and served as almost a blooming flower. Beautiful to look at and very tasty as well.

Montreal Plaza was a perfect spot for our anniversary dinner and a lovely look into the minds of Chef Crete and his team. Great food, great atmosphere and wonderful service in a unique space. You don't associate Plaza St-Hubert with fine dining but this becomes a worthwhile member of Montreal's best.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with interesting menu.
We went there a group of 10 we had the tasting menu and were at \" Le Bureau \" 
Dishes were tasteful and beautiful presented, service was very good too .!!!
Definitely on my top 5 !!!"}
{"text":"Tbh, I was expecting more from a restaurant that holds the 11th spot on Canada's top 100 (2017). Don't get me wrong. This place gets a four stars in my book but not a strong four stars. The food was good and well executed. We shared four dishes. The famous whelks with miso butter (a take on the escargots in butter). It was my favourite dish. Then we got the razor clam Chinatown style. It was ok. We were expecting something warm (hot) and not a cold dish. It was unexpected. That was my least favourite dish. We also got the cavatelli with foie gras sauce and duck. Very rich and filling. And last but not least, we ordered the meat for two which was the skirts steak that was cooked to a perfect temperature! We were full!!! 

As for the service. It was good but but I guess it's the kind of service that one would expect to get when the prices are so steep. I personally have had a better time at other restaurants but hubby really like it here."}
{"text":"Service de classe meme si on passe juste pour un café , je me suis senti bien acceuilli et je compte y retourner pour un repas complet , cela avait l'air bon :)"}
