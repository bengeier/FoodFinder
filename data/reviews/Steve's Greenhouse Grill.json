{"text":"I came here during Phoenix Comic Con, I was planning on going here around 4pm but the place had a 35 minute wait so me and my friends decided to just go to their bar. We waited a few minutes for a spot to open and we sat around and waited for the bartender to come to us. She never did and when she did I asked her for a beer and she did not even look up at me, she went and did her business and attended everyone else but me, so I just left I thought it was BS. I decided to give this place a second chance so I went there at around 11pm and this time we sat at one of the tables, we waited 15 minutes for someone to come help us and when we did we ordered two drinks, they took a long time with those drinks and the place was not even busy. After that they completely forgot about us, we were contemplating walking out on the check but instead we waved the server down for our check. I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"We stopped in last Friday to have a quick bite to eat and take advantage of happy hour specials.  In a city full of great food, we couldn't have regretted our choice more.  It's partially our fault, as we were in \"we're on vacation and we can eat whatever we want mode\" and ordered fried calamari, fried cheese sticks, and fried chicken fingers.  No, the menu doesn't state fried so redundantly.  Taking the blame for our unhealthy choices, I still have to say this is the worst food I've ever had in the Phoenix area. We were raking our brains trying to come up with any other place that was even close to this bad, and couldn't come up with anything to compare it to.  My boyfriend's comment, \"how can you screw up fries?\"  The only plus was that our waitress was quick, and nice.  She offered to replace my beer (ordered the special, terrible!) with something I would like, and was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Dirt in my salad , flat beer but they are making it by being expensive, indifferent and slow..."}
{"text":"Thanks for the volleyball special and easily accommodating our large groups.  Food was good, service was good and everyone had a solid meal for a good price."}
{"text":"We ate here with a living social deal. Without that we may not have ever known about this place . We enjoyed the atmosphere on the patio. The food was ok, nothing outstanding. The three stars is pretty right on for the food. Our issue with this place was the our waitress, who was overly fake friendly and borderline rude. My husband asked for mayo for his burger which he still had half left, she brought the mayo, along with our dessert (there was not a choice of desserts with the living social deal). She walked by and set them on the table without saying anything. The dessert had ice cream with it, which obviously wasn't going to make it until we were done eating. Also, even though we ordered extra stuff above and beyond the living social deal, she felt the need to remind us we \"HAVE\" to tip on the total cost of the bill including what we got with the living social deal. Which left us totally speechless and that remark caused her tip to be cut in half. We like to use groupon and living social deals to try places we may not otherwise have known about. This is the first time we have ever made to feel bad for taking advantage of a deal from either of those. 

I would have given 3 stars because the food was ok and we enjoyed the atmosphere, but the  staff/service bumps it down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast after flying in, we'd been up since 2am and were starving. My parents both had huevos rancheros, both said it was ok but not great, but the chili that came with it was good. I had biscuits and gravy with a side of toast and it was decent but nothing special. Husband ordered a steak sandwich and liked it.  Service was good except they forgot my coffee and I had to ask for it again when the food came.

Overall OK but next time I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Business takes me downtown a few times a month. I had never been here before but thought I would try it for lunch today. Had a burger which was pretty pedestrian. Fries were cold. I would have said something to the waitress but never saw her again. Service was pretty bad, the hostess who seats you seemed pissed that customers where there. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Servers unaware of specials, inconsistent attention. Waiter came to our table brought orders, left us hanging. Went in to bar and got attitude from the bar tender. She literally chucked my boyfriend's ID back at him across the bar. My annoyance with getting ignored by the server and a manager who came out to talk to our table about pricing problems, when all I wanted to do was order a drink, was palpable -- but seriously who wouldn't be annoyed. Btw, even after manager said they would take care of pricing problem, final bill didn't reflect it. This place is the pits."}
{"text":"I have really mixed reviews with this bar / restaurant. It's very casual and has a great outdoor patio in the front facing the semi-private street. I liked the atmosphere a lot. It's more sports related. There's multiple seating on the large patio as well as inside the bar. The bottled beer specials are unbeatable for a downtown bar. Beer, wine, and mixed drinks are 1/2 off. The bottles averaged $2 on happy hour while other bars average $4-$5 for bottles.. Happy hour outside on the patio is 3-6. It's continued to 7pm if you go inside the restaurant. Pricing on bottles is definitely, A+. They have a happy hour food menu with $4 and $5 pricing and a nice selection. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. My experience was completely soured when I ordered the Mexican pizza on the happy hour menu. Mexican pizzas are supposed to be pizzas hence the name pizza. This was a very cheap, flat cheese crisp with limited cheese and jalapenos.It was a cheese crisp at best. It was by far the worse aka Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I immediately complained to the server. I actually told her it was horrific, not a pizza, and the worse example of a Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I told her I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. She completely agreed!!! She also said it looked horrible and wasn't worth eating!!! YET, there was no offer to comp it off my bill or bring the manager over. I told her to tell the cook it was awful. She just kept agreeing. I didn't get compensated for it, no apology, just nothing. I left the entire thing sitting on the table. If you're looking for cheap bottled beer, a pretty cool atmosphere, and easy parking, this is your place. I couldn't rate it a 1 star because of the other perks. Not comping me and agreeing how horrible the food was is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food was about what I would expect for average bar fare, it'll do in a pinch,  late at night.   The problem is with the service.   Our waitress was rude,  unhelpful,  and very sarcastic.....when asked to fix one of her errors,  the response was \"well,  there isn't anything I can do about it now,  so sorry\".   

We had a medium sized party,  and there was an automatic %18 gratuity added,  which I refused to pay!   Normally I tip well,  but no way this time.   It is safe to say I will never be eating at this establishment again!"}
{"text":"I was a vendor at Phoenix Comic Con, running on a tight schedule in the morning. I happened to be with a few \"Pirates for Hire\" on this fun and nerdy day. Hoping for a relatively quick sit down, the first thing that we noticed was Steve's Greenhouse Grill. 

We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated, puzzled... the place was still pretty much empty!  A massive line did form behind us however. Finally when we were sat, we continued to sit there looking cool for another 25 minutes before even being served. Let me tell you how uncomfortable it is to have a table full of hungry, irritated, picky, rushed, short fused pirates. Eagerly barking out food orders to this poor waitress, we noticed a horrible confusion happening with the humongous line that had formed. Yelling, crying, threatening, panic...It was the perfect storm, and on this special day they were absolutely bombarded by an upset horde of fictional heroes, monsters and villains."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on my trip. Breakfest was very good. Biscuit and gravy were very good, like homemade.  Very good eggs.  Also had the meatloaf which was very good as well.  Nice atmosphere.   Waiter worked his but off and did a good job."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! The waitress sounded like she had no clue what she was talking about. Menu is NOT at all accurate. Had another waitress yell at me to move out of her way so she could deliver food to another table,  one of the items we ordered was inaccurate and when we asked about it she said there was \"nothing she could do about it now\". Some of the meals were missing items that should have been included as stated in the menu. It took forever to bring one of the drinks to our party.  Saw one of the waitresses sit down at the table next to ours to take those patrons order. Just an ask around horrible experience.  Will NEVER go there again,  food was not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Food was decent.. Nothing special, nothing horrible. I had an Arnold Palmer (half lemonade / half tea) and the crab cake burger.. 

Again, wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst.. I wanted to give 3.5 stars, but since I couldn't I gave 3.. 

The service was adequate for the time (lunch hour rush)"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Coffee was awful. Service was pitiful. We waited 15 minutes for our coffee before breakfast. Waitress disappeared for that whole time. The food came and -- oops-- she forgot about the coffee, water and OJ. Breakfast over, and she was nowhere to be found again. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I've tried coming here multiple times and it never gets better. Service is sub par, and the food is usually cold. This time we are here for comic con and it's busy but it ain't that busy. So far it's been over 30 minutes for chicken fingers. Chicken fingers. Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"The friendliest group of servers. Food is good. Come here most weekends with friends and they treat us right."}
{"text":"Nice little place right next to the Hyatt downtown Phoenix. Got breakfast here multiple times during my stay. Terrific and nice waitresses, and the breakfast is excellent. Coffee is also really surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Seeing that they only have 2.5 stars does NOT surprise me! My friend and I decided to try this grill since it was across the street from the Hyatt. There was no wait to be seated, and when we got there, there were a few people at the bar, and a table of around 8 seated.  The place was otherwise empty.  We got there at about 4:25 and were seated by an older woman (fake blonde hair, around her 60's from the look at it)  that was our server said was the hostess.  About 15 min later, my friend inquired (at the bar) if we were supposed to order at the bar, at which she was told no, we should have a server.  Another 10 min went by at which time I approached the older lady and asked her \"do we need to find somewhere else to eat or will someone be serving us within the next couple min?\"  She got snappy and said that she would have someone right with us.  Raquel--the server--came by momentarily and took our order.  A couple min later, the older lady came by and asked with an attitude, \"Did your server come over?\" which we replied yes to....as she walked away--with a VERY rude tone, \"then there is no problem!\"

The server came by with our drinks and we asked what the older's lady name and if she was the manager.  She informed us that her name was Linda and that she is not the manager but a hostess.  We asked for a manager.  Linda came over in just a few moments and said, \"you asked for a manager?\" When we responded yes, she said she was the manager.  I asked her for a different manager and she said she's the only one on duty.  I told her, \"ok, thank you.  I'll call on Monday and speak to a different manager.\" at which point her response was \"If there's a problem, we can ask you to leave now.\"  I told her that her attitude was the problem and I will take it up with someone else at another time.  Her next statement was, \"Do you want to eat or not?!\"  I advised her we already placed our order.  As she walked away she made another comment, at which point I said \"There's that attitude again!\"

The food looked good but had no flavor.  Raquel was wonderful and was on top of it.  We left her a good cash tip since her service was good....it's just too bad she has to work with people like that!"}
{"text":"Came in New Years Eve with my family. Great, fast, friendly service. Good beers on tap too! We all ordered burgers. They were meaty and cooked to order. Server was really cool to our kids and they even gave them hats and blowers. We will certainly visit again. A great way to end our evening downtown."}
{"text":"Bummer.  Fantastic drinks and prices.  Went in for lunch and after an hour they were not so apologetic   We left without getting out food.  Drinks only ok.  Kitchen and staff not so good on busy days. With the location next to the convention center one would think they would be staffed.  If not staffed at least attentive."}
{"text":"I really like Steve's. I love their wonton chips and salsa. I usually order the soup and salad combo. Everything is tasty. They have great weekly specials and their wing special seems to be a big hit. The only downside is sometimes you get great service and other times not so much."}
{"text":"If I could rate this with a negative number, I would.  This was among the worst dining experiences I have had, and my review will present a factual description of why I feel that way..  We were a party of 8, having dinner before a concert.  Two of the meals were inedible, but only one was comped.  A third meal had to be returned, and the replacement didn't come for another ten minutes.  Then, it was barely edible, and my friend ate only a few bites of it .  I ordered the caesar salad with steak, dressing on the side.  The server brought me a caesar salad with dressing mixed in, and without the steak.  Five minutes later, he brought the steak in a bowl, looking very unappetizing.  It was o.k., and I ate it. We will never return to this restaurant, and I will describe our experience to any friends who may ask about the place."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not bad not great. I had the vegetable fajitas. Beans were soupy. Veggies were drowning in oil. Service was terrible. Slow and  inattentive. Waitress brougt out the wrong meal for my partner. Before we could get a word out she was gone. We didn't see the server again until we were done with our meal. She agreed it was her mistake and took 10% of our bill. The dish served was $13. The dish ordered was $10. She took off $2.33. So in the end we paid more to have a dish we didn't want. I noticed a problem with the table next to us with the bill. Seems to be a real problem with this server."}
{"text":"2nd time here...Erica the bar tender had a problem with us taking 30 seconds too long to decide what beer we wanted. After that she didn't ask us if we were ok or check to even see if we wanted another round. Then when we were closing out, she shorted us on our change and said it was tax included. Funny cause I didn't think there was a 20% tax on beer. Place was cool but service made it shit."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and decided to give this place a try.  I'm not a fan... If I was binge drinking then I could have tolerated the horrible service and mediocre food.  I hate fast food but would probably just hit Burger King around the corner next time.  I was hoping it would be a great find."}
{"text":"Really nice jumping point for a good night in Phoenix. Crab Cake Sandwich was great!"}
{"text":"Steve's - where whole foods rain? 

The front cover of Steve's menu speaks towards the owners views, policies and procedures regarding the use of chemicals on/in their foods. Simply put, there are no chemical preservatives used on any food items they sell. Now to some this may be of no concern, but to others this mentality is priceless. I had a chicken salad and draft beer....I know I know, salad and beer are not exactly a normal combo...but then again I'm not exactly your normal dude either. Never the less, it was fantastically chemical free. I sat at the bar, my usual m.o., and the service was friggin stellar; hats off the barkeep. 

All and all I had a great experience. I give 4-stars for customer service and lack of chemicals.

Go to Steve's."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Not only was the bartender disrespectful but the whole staff was horrible. The rude staff and below average food isn't worth your time or money."}
{"text":"I don't understand the nasty reviews - a couple of you could stand to not use so much foul language!!

This was my first time to Phoenix, we stayed at the Hyatt - Steve's is right across the street.  Our first morning we went for breakfast.  Our waitress was so adorable!!  She was friendly and related well to all of us.   My BF loves corned beef hash but NOT from a can.  Our waitress confirmed it was real fresh corned beef hash - it was the best we've ever had out!   I had the belgian waffle with strawberries -that was ok.  My son had the french toast - that was really good!

Later that night our dinner plans got canceled so we went back.  BF got the buffalo burger - it was a little dry, but buffalo is.  It had a great taste and they were very accommodating to everything he wanted on it.  I had the meatloaf sliders - the best meatloaf I've ever had - better than mine and that's saying a lot.   The waitress said that was new on the menu.   My son had the chicken wings - they give you 12 chicken wings for $8.  In CA you'd get 4.   And, they had several flavors of chicken wings to choose from.  The wings were great!!

Oh, and my BF got tater tots with his burger - SOOOOOOO good.  Perfectly crispy yet soft and yummy inside.

They had 4 TV's inside and 2 outside.  We had a great view of two games!!

We already plan on going back to Phoenix and going back to Steve's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must-stop place in downtown Phoenix. They have $2 tacos every day & they're delicious!  Happy hour prices can't be beat. Lots of indoor & outdoor seating with plenty of TVs for watching sports. The food, prices & staff are fantastic!  It's the kind of place that appreciates your business and works hard to let you know that. If you want to have a good meal or just hangout & have a few drinks, this is the perfect place to go!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 5 while on busines.  We were seated right away and drink orders were taken.  This is the only positive I can say about our visit.  The service was horribly slow in taking our orders and even slower in getting our food.  The lettuce on the sandwiches was unwashed and was caked with dirt.  I would not recommend this place while in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Came here after a Suns game on Friday night and it was pretty mellow compared to any other bar in DT Phoenix on a weekend night.  The food was alright.  My ostrich burger was good, but nothing to rave about.  Our waiter for some reason seemed awkward every time he showed up at our table, but maybe that was just me.  He wasn't rude or anything.  Just awkward.  There were tv's everywhere and seem like it'd be awesome for sports games.  We had a musician on the street singing to everyone.  I am sure he's not a regular but he made that night pretty good with his music."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant several times during my visit to Phoenix. Good Happy Hour, I really liked the meatloaf sliders.Staff was friendly especially Shannon."}
{"text":"We had a light dinner here before going to the ballet. Crab cakes were very tasty and how can you go wrong with a Caesar salad?  I've eaten there before but always sat outside which is pleasant. Inside this time and have to say it felt a bit dingy but seemed clean. Wait staff was great, attentive but not hovering. A delightful young man with a pleasant bit of conversation which gives  a more personal feel to dinning out. I'm sure we will eat there again"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak and potato, turns out they are out of potatoes. Potatoes, people!
The $20 steak came and it was layered in fat. Tough to cut through with a steak knife, almost too much work. Talked to the manager, Tony. He basically told me tough luck. Not exactly a customer orientated business, in my opinion. I would not eat here again if it was free.
The bright side is, Blue Moon for $3 and a guy out on the curb playing guitar, made it okay. Just really disappointed in customer care and attention to quality."}
{"text":"Location, Location, Location.  That is all.  Only been there once, but yuk, what, and hello..? (food, menu, and service) will prob give it another try."}
{"text":"This place looked okay on yelp, it was only a block from our hotel so we walked there to pick up breakfast on Sunday. We walked in and had to sit ourselves and were handed two menus without a word from a sullen teenage server and were then ignored for almost 20 minutes so we walked out. It looked grubby and the menus were sticky. Altogether this place deserves ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"It was a warm morning here, but not as warm and friendly as our server Gordon was. I had breakfast, hash and eggs. The food was excellent, the coffee never empty and the price was very reasonable. Eat here, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"After seeing them on Groupon, My wife and I decided to try the breakfast. The menus on their website are outdated- there is no breakfast buffet. There is a message that says 'new website coming soon'. Still though, the menu should be taken down... Suffice to say I was little upset by the lack of buffet. So we ordered a few things off the normal breakfast menu. My wife ordered some cheesy, bacon omelet which came with a side of potatoes and 2 pieces of toast. I ordered the french toast with 2 eggs on the side. Everything was very good. Service was fine as well. Prices are pretty good- though $2.75 for coffee seemed a bit much. I would come back for the french toast alone."}
{"text":"steve's is one of the best values and great food downtown. They have been there over 35 years. The best happy hour prices downtown on  drinks and food.

Their salads are unique and wonderful, the burgers are fabulous and if you like fries dont miss these.  All there desserts are homemade. Even the steaks are unbelievable quality."}
{"text":"I was on town for a convention with a friend and this restaurant was the closest to our hotel. We both ordered the special of fish and chips with a side of clam chowder. It took forever for our food to come out. I didn't like the chowder, fish was ok and my fries were soggy with oil. The waiter we had was fantastic. He had us laughing anytime he came around. Gave the 3 star rating an extra star just because of that. I would come back for the friendly staff but just stick to drinks."}
{"text":"The best crab cakes and grilled chicken Ceasar salad! Definately a place to visit in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We started out Saturday morning May 30th with a breakfast at Steve's. We wanted to entertain ourselves by watching the amazing Comicon crowd and we were not disappointed. Our waitress, Kathy greeted us with a smile and sat us in the huge outdoor patio. She immediately told us about the free Wi-Fi and the specials. She served our drinks within minutes of ordering which impressed all of us because the restaurant was full. I had a Grey Goose Bloody Mary that was fresh, mildly spiced, and mixed perfectly. The breakfast menu is huge which is refreshing for Phoenix. I ordered the California Omlette, and is was huge, fluffy, full of vegie's topped with cheese and guac. I could only eat half but Kathy quickly put the rest in a to go container. This was the best omelette I've had in downtown Phoenix. Two Bloody mary's later we left and we're thanked by 3 different people on our way out the door. Needless to say, this will be where we go to dinner tonight and a \"go to\" from now on."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Steve's whenever we're in downtown Phx for games and events...probably have been here ten times. Happy Hour stuff including the free appetizer set up by the bar is a good deal and nice touch! Daily specials are great and atmosphere is a little funky and we actually feel like we're in an urban setting. Bartenders and staff are kinda laid back, it's nice to be in a place where you don't have to be a 21 year old model to work or hang out :)"}
{"text":"Arrived with a group of seven for breakfast. Two waitresses independently 'cared' for our table making it impossible to know whether a request was being followed up or not - because requests took a long time to prompt any action. The restaurant was hardly crowded, yet we still waited nearly 40 minutes for our food to arrive - which ended up being cold, undercooked or plain just not what was ordered. The food was low quality (e.g. raspberries drowning in sauce/syrup straight from a jar) and often near tasteless. 

Unfortunately gratuity is included for a group our size, because the experience definitely didn't warrant it."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from the Wyndham and Hyatt hotels and the west entrance of the convention center. Decent breakfast (good breakfast burrito!), average lunch / dinner. This place is good if you are at the hotel and need a quick meal, but don't make plans to go here for a sit down dinner, you're better off going somewhere else. It is better than the place next door, called Matador. We had breakfast here twice and lunch once, out of convenience because of our conference at the convention center."}
{"text":"2 stars, all for friendly staff. The food was below par. I had the top sirloin with grill shrimp. The shrimp tasted like it was from Walmart and the cut I got for steak was unworthy of finishing. Way to tough and I ordered medium, I literally bent my fork trying to hS the steal while I cut with my knife. I got this place because I used the app UrbanDaddy which the mood was not the problem, great suggestion, just didn't enjoy the meal I had here. 

Not a lot to say. It was dark, small bar, but it is a restaurant not a bar. I wouldn't go back. Give it a try if you want, your experience might be different."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this was my favorite place to eat when I lived near Downtown Phx. It has been a few months since our last visit and today we decided to go back so that we could take my cousin and her boyfriend to our fave spot.  My husband and I were excited taste their yummy wings.  However, that excitement quickly became a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! 

Let me start off by saying that the waitress and food from today really sucked!  First, we ordered drinks and they took forever to come back even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  Then, we ordered wings, the chicken tenderloins, and a burger w/ fries. These didn't take that long but when they came out I thought that something was off. The wings were served in a silver bowl where the wings are tossed, which I have NEVER EVER seen done in my visits to this place. No presentation, everything was just blah.... I went ahead and tried them expecting great taste as always but INSTEAD they tasted old and not cooked correctly. They had a very chewy consistency. We normally chow these down but based on how horrible they were my husband did NOT even eat!!  I left most of the wings as well!! And moving on to the tenderloins... I don't know what is going on at Steve's but whatever it is, it's not good!!! The tenderloins looked like they were popped out of a frozen bag and thrown into the fryer. They were chewy and felt hard on the outside! Nothing fresh about them, PLUS THEY TASTED LIKE FISH completely gross!!! Someone is using oil to fry fish and then using it to fry other foods which is totally disgusting!!!!!  The fries that came with the burger tasted just like FISH as well! All of it just totally killed my appetite and we did not even say anything to the waitress because we wanted to get out of there and not make a scene.

I will NOT GO BACK AT ALL!!  I was so disappointed by my experience at Steve's today. I don't know who the person is that is in charge is right now but all I can say is that they're doing a horrible job and killing this place!  In my past visits, the owner: an anglo, short chubby lady with short blonde hair was there and the restaurant was doing well but now it just seems to have GONE TO THE DUMPS!! I wasted my money today but that is ok, at least now I know not to go back and to tell others not to waste their money at this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place while staying overnight at the Hyatt.  Thought it looked like a place where students would party at night, but also loved the patio setting.  We decided to have dinner there...and I am so glad we did!  The food was fabulous and presented as if it were on the verge of being gourmet type food.  Totally unexpected and delicious!  And the bonus was that our meals each only cost $8.95, which was the special menu of that time period, I guess.  While we were enjoying our meals, a musician set up on the sidewalk in front of where we were sitting and began playing some mellow, folksie type music, which was perfect.  Our waiter was a bit quirky and disheveled looking, but friendly enough and more than willing to do whatever it took to please us.   We are not hard to please, though, as long at the service and food is worthwhile...which it was.  We will definitely go back to Steve's whenever the opportunity presents itself.  :)"}
{"text":"What is it with Phoenix and getting orders wrong!!!
This was the 2nd restaurant in 2 days that got my order wrong.  I am not typically one to complain, but when the waiter takes the order and writes it down, then I would think the cook would get it right, right?  Anyway, the place was average.  I had a root-beer float and it was actually better than the food.  If, I would have known, I would have just had the float.
The waiter was trying too hard to be funny and play off the mistake, but didn't work.  I left dissatisfied.
I think this place stays in business just because it is close to the convention center and in the district with a lot of tourism traffic.  Maybe the bar, although I never had a drink there."}
{"text":"Ugh... Rip off. 

Calamari was supposed to be served with 2 sauces. It wasn't. When I asked about it (20 min later when I got the servers attention) I was informed that what I missed was a generic tartar sauce and did I want it now...
Then I asked for their \"best\" \"favorite\" \"most asked for item\" on the menu. I was steered to the taco salad. 
MEH - guacamole was fine and that's saying a lot. 

Had an Amazon Local and they tried to rip me off. Manager was called over and he \"fixed\" the bill after another 20 minutes and blamed the server.  Walked away and left me hanging again. No apologies no ownership. Nothing. 
Customer service = 0
Food = 0
Rip-off artists = 5"}
{"text":"RUDE OWNER, BORING FOOD, TOO SPENDY FOR 'BAR-FOOD'

I work and live downtown, yet have never been to this restaurant. Today I checked the Groupon Now! deal site and saw Steve's offering an $8 for $12 Now! Deal. I decided to try something new, and as I only ever get 'to-go' lunch, confirmed this was allowed to use the deal. 

Called in my order ahead, waited the suggested amount of time before heading over, then waited at restaurant for order. Once my order was ready, I was presented with bill for $14.26 ($13 entree + tax). I presented the Groupon worth $12. Server said, \"I'll have to see if I can use this.\" Went to the back area and returned with a female employee. They discussed something I couldn't make out, then server came back to me with bill of $4.26. Before handing him my card, I asked why it was $4.26, instead of $2.26 ($14.26 bill - $12 Groupon = $2.26 balance). Before he could speak, the female employee behind the bar spoke up, rudely and loudly, saying [paraphrased], \"I always add a tip to to-go's, to give these guys a chance to make money. I assume you would tip them anyway.\" I asked her why this wasn't part of the terms, that she is not allowed to force gratuity on a customer when not explicitly stated in the terms. She said, again raising her voice to me unnecessarily, \"I am the owner and have already told Groupon to change the terms to not allow to-go orders. I don't even have to accept it.\" I reminded her that as the customer this is not my issue, but hers with Groupon, and that I am not obligated to pay tip or required to dine-in to redeem this deal, as the deal's terms did not state either. Again, she was extremely rude and loud, saying that the point of the deal was to bring customers in to sit and dine, not to get a to-go. 

Deciding it was pointless to attempt to converse such an ignorant individual, I informed her that she lost that opportunity because I would never be back. She continued to speak over me and ignored my attempt at discussing the issue as an adult. 

Not sure why she couldn't explain this to me calmly, as a rational 'business owner', but instead allowed the the server to present me with a incorrect bill. Why not personally explain the mistake on the Groupon terms (that they do not allow to-go's on Groupons or that she would request a gratuity included in my charge), and earn a customer, instead of alienating one? . Instead, she successfully removed any chance that I will patron this establishment again. 

With all the other delicious, super-friendly, and locally-owned/runned lunch options in the downtown area, I feel patrons should be aware of this business's practices. Not sure about you, but I would rather NOT be inaccurately billed, berated and fussed at by a restaurant employee during my lunch. Your choice!

Oh... and after all that, how did the pasta taste? Eh -- nothing special. Like boiled noodles with canned cream sauce, and two strips of over-cooked chicken. Went to Chipotle instead :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Dinner salad was dumped out of a bag with absolutely nothing added to the white chunks of lettuce from the core.  White chicken chili did not reveal any signs of chicken.  Spiceness added to make up for the lack of flavor.  You virtually walk through the kitchen to reach the small, outdated restrooms that are in need of a cleaning.  Server was pleasant though.  There are many choices downtown Phoenix.  Skip this one and keep walking down the street."}
{"text":"Wings were delicious.. Waitress was helpful. Just made a quick stop before a concert with my lady. I will definantley try to go back next time i'm in the area..!!"}
{"text":"This place is marginal at best...the food is nothing special and the service is absolutely horrible. We ate here last year and were unimpressed but figured we would give them the benefit of the doubt and another try...big mistake!!! We stood outside waiting to be seated for forever and  were finally greeted ( and I used the term lightly)by some sour faced hostess that seemed to hate her job... maybe even her life.  Another long wait and our server showed up... the food did come out quickly... but how long does soup and salad take.  But after that he pretty much disappeared.... We sat there for the better part of 30 minutes ...totally finished eating, just hanging out for our check. We were seated outside and saw several groups of people just walk away because they were tired of standing there waiting to be seated. I would understand if the place was busy but it is far from it...its too bad because we do a lot of work at symphony hall and would frequent this place because its convenient...but I think I've had my final bad experience"}
{"text":"We came here to eat after watching Phoenix Symphony.  We liked that they advertised variety.  However, service was terrible from the beginning--there was no hostess and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  We ordered street tacos, a cowboy cheeseburger (cooked medium), white chicken chili and a quesadilla.  It took about 30-45 minutes to receive our food.  The burger was burnt to a crisp, tacos were cold, quesadilla very greasy, and chili had hardly any chicken.  There were not many people in the restaurant, but the server did not give us the attention and care expected.  We wanted to support a local business, but we will not return."}
{"text":"Never again. My last minute birthday dinner sucked after horrid service that didn't remember/forgot: to bring any water (but they managed to type two free waters in our bill), my dish came with a side item, to bring my boyfriend ketchup and took over 7 min to get a bill then 7 min to have him take it away. My boyfriend's drink also came in a airplane glass (same size you get for those of you that fly) and it costed $5.50 for well-gin and sprite, really? Plus, while waiting for our dishes, he brought us two of the wrong ones and we had to tell him it wasn't ours. Never had a \"sorry\" come out of his mouth about anything. Even two of the other bussers asked if we needed anything and we just said \"no, just waiting on our bill.\" I have never wanted to walk out of a restaurant until now. 

*This is really sad considering my first experience here was quite nice."}
{"text":"I ate here twice while I was at a convention. It's convenient. The servers were nice, the selection was great and my food came out quickly...and they give you lots of it. I needed a to go box for breakfast. 
The Cajun sausage and tortilla soup were my favorite things."}
{"text":"I've visited Steve's for the live music they have occasionally. The food is good but not always top-notch. Wait staff is not always on the ball and we've had to visit the bar for drink refills. Last time I visited I was disappointed to see that the menu had changed and the desserts I LOVE are now gone. I'll still go back for the music though."}
{"text":"I felt like the food was fresh service was fast. And very good price and you get a lot for your money. Just visiting in Phoenix for a business trip and it was perfect walking distance from the Sheraton Hotel."}
{"text":"Been there twice!  Both times the food was good.  Nothing to write home about but decently good.  The reason for the 2 stars...the service!  Wow!  Talk about horrible service.  The first time we went we sat for about 20 mins without our server even approaching our table.  We finally had to flag him down and ask him if we can put our order in.  The rest of the visit was more of the same.  Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own.  2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted.  Had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table.  My cousin had time to walk to CVS and back before the server came to our table and take our order.  I don't think I will go back.  Service just really sucked.  No one was rude or anything but being constantly ignored was not an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great (unfortunately I don't remember his name) but the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered the wedge salad and am still amazed that it left the kitchen in the condition in which I received it. Saddest salad ever. Our group (10 of us) were all disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt right across the street recently on business and happily walked over for lunch and dinner here.  I highly recommend the Crab Cake Salad; crab cakes were really good.  Service is good, and had a couple of servers who really know how long everything takes... really great when you have very little time.  I like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places which gets a lot of foot traffic from the Phoenix convention center which is less than a block away. They cater to all crowds and the staff is always kind. 
I'm not posting just for this though. It's all about their WINGS! They have the best, let me repeat, The Best chicken WINGS I've eaten anywhere in the Phoenix valley. You can get them fried or grilled, but fried is the way to go in my opinion. The Chipotle Honey hot sauce is amazing, but they offer quite a few other flavors such as BBQ, Parmesean, and Garlic. What makes them the best is their size. There are not your ordinary buffalo wild WINGS bite size. These are huge, juicy WINGS made to get dirty.. 
Their drink specials compliment their WINGs well and I suggest to GO on Thursday, as that is .50 cent wing day!!!
Cheers"}
{"text":"Wow...... told our server MO ahead of time that we had BOGOs.... after arguing with me about their validity, I validated my BOGO... downhill after that.... if you don't want ppl to use  these things, don't publish them!!!.... The food here is amazing, and I will still go back, but then I found out she is a MANAGER!... Rude, short, and brought out 2 of the 4 dinners 10 min later because we had separate checks!! She said we HAD to have separate checks because of the BOGO!!!!!!... she did get very friendly...... when I asked for the check!!!! We still tipped 15% on the original bill... would have been 25%, but come on...... she is a Mgr!!!!!....feel really bad for the employees if this is how she treats guests!!"}
{"text":"This place could probably be winning or losing depending on the nite. For me, not a big win.  First they were out of the beer I ordered.. only finding out after 15 minutes. Secondly it was $5 burger night and a turkey burger was included but you could not order any toppings a regular burger had unless they charged you per topping.. odd when turkey was \"included in the deal\" .  Then.... I bit into it.. it was okay.. and then.. as I pulled the burger away from my mouth after the 3rd bite something held on.. a hair lingered in between the burger and my teeth. Not mine.  They made me a new one and the manager never came around or apologized and they still charged me.  Last time I had a hair in my food they made me a new plate and comped my meal and management even apologized
..mishap forgiven; customer service cherished,  and I still go with love in my heart for the place and the delicious food. Not this place! I understand that randomness and mishaps happen, but to not treat a customer with respect afterward does not deserve my appraise.  Props to the new waitress who had to deal with it, however your management should go back to hospitality school.  What a shame. It could be an awesome place, great seating indoors and out, and even some live music.. much potential. I hope it gets better. Good luck."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The staff was terrible.  It's hard to eat good food when your stomach is turning from rude and dysfunctional waitresses."}
{"text":"Meatloaf breakfast was terrible (worse than frozen dinner) and service equaled the food."}
{"text":"Hey Tony was an add. Refused to give me his name and was clearly drinking on the job."}
{"text":"The only reason I would ever come back was for the wings, and they were mediocre at that. It took 25 minutes for our waitress to come to us, and that was after we went inside and asked for someone to come out. No drink refills, didn't ask how our food was, and never came back to take our card to pay for the bill. We had to go back inside and ask the bartender to take care of it. I would not recommend this place at all and won't go back."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!
Food was horrible and service was mediocre.
Walk down the street and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I just wanted a beer and a quick meal...20 minutes after sitting down an annoyed waiter came by and took my order...20 minutes after that I still had nothing...no water...no beer...no food. The hostess approached me with a water, but I was on my way out.  I'd give it zero stars but there was a lady playing some nice music on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. 
The bar is super tiny. They had a complementary snacks buffet advertised out front. We went in and didn't see anything. When we asked the bartender told us they burnt the food so there wouldn't be any. OK. 
The decor is all neon lights and straight out of the 80's which was actually kind of endearing. 
The servers were very odd, loud and kind of annoying.
I'm not sure why but this place just didn't speak to me... 

They do have $1.75 Miller Lights on draft for happy hour."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast at the recommendation of the hotel I was stay. When I arrived it took a few minutes to have me seated even though the restaurant was empty ( should have been a sign of what was to come ). When I sat down I told the waiter that I was waiting on another person and they would only want coffee and was ready to order . He brought the coffee but left me waiting for about 10 minutes until I asked another server to take my order . I explained to her what the situation was and she had the audacity to tell me to relax . The manager who came over could care less how her employees treat the customers so we walked out . Poor customer service , would not recommend"}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall bar! Good drink prices, and huge menu. Never had anything I didn't like. Daily specials like $5 burgers and taco Tuesdays! Good spot to go before a game or to watch a game."}
{"text":"It was late and there weren't too many restaurants still open on a Sunday night in downtown Phoenix after the Suns game. Our group walked past this place and decided to try it. I wasn't too hungry and opted for the chicken fingers and fries. It was a little pricey at 11.99 and would've expected a little bit bigger portion. The place had a little bit of a \"dirty\" vibe to it, as there were tables around us where the plates hadn't been cleared and there were large crumbs visible on the floor."}
{"text":"I ran across one of my friend's reviews of this place on Facebook. I experienced poor service here as well during a political event nearby & so I feel compelled to share his experience as well.


***TL;DR Version: If you're near the con today, be wary about eating at Steve's Greenhouse Grill. Tony, one of the managers, is completely oblivious to good customer service. One of the servers even said this. I'm not a scene-causing person and he pissed me off enough to do it.***

Anyone who knows me, knows that it takes a lot to make me angry. I try to be very understanding with people in the service industry. I'm not a big \"let me speak to the manager\" type of person, unless it's absolutely necessary. Last night, after PCC, I hung out with my friends at Steve's Greenhouse Grill (across the street from Networks). Service was painfully slow, but I chalked that up to being busy with the con crowd. At the end of the night, my bill was $7 more than it should've been. Turns out they gave us an old menu, with old drink prices. We asked to speak to the manager, which made the servers oddly uncomfortable. When I brought this up to Tony, the manager, he decided to fight me on it. \"It was an honest mistake that we left that menu on your table, but that's what the prices are. It's still cheaper than everywhere else around here.\" After telling him that wasn't the point, he took my receipt to \"correct\" it. He docked $3. After asking him what that was about, he says \"I gave you a discount. So, we're good? Are you gonna come back?\" Which was a weird thing to ask. I objected and told him that he should honor the prices on the menu given to us. He took my receipt and \"corrected\" it again. He took the discount off and put the original overcharged price back on. I was pissed. He then said to me \"Well, I tried to help you, and you didn't like it, so now you have to pay the whole bill.\" At this point, it was beyond about being overcharged. I may have thrown a few, or a lot of profanities at this guy. One of the servers tried to diffuse the situation by offering me $7 of her own tips, which I refused. The other servers even whispered to me \"just go,\" encouraging me to skip out on the bill. They obviously disliked this manager. I told them that I wanted to take care of the bill with the owner, when she came in the next day. What ended up happening, was an off-duty manager was sympathetic to my situation, so he went and told Tony to take the $7 off. After paying the bill, Tony borderline sarcastically says \"I apologize. Have a nice night,\" to which I sarcastically responded \"You too!\" In typical Comic Book Guy delivery: Worst. Manager. Ever."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. I was planning on writing a review when I got home but I couldn't wait,I had to do it now.  This place is disgusting. Terrible service and we've been waiting to get our food for an hour. Hell,I've been waiting to get a glass of hot water and have had to ask 3x! I'm with a party of 6 and I wish I could walk out!!! The only redeemable quality is the live music on the sidewalk but that doesn't even count because they're an independent contractor. 

Management!!! Do yourself a favor and get your shit together. There are other restaurants in the area with amazing service and delicious food. No reason for a paying customer to have to put up with this.


Update:

After taking two hours to get our food,we decided to eat our crab Cakes (at least try because they were gross and fishy)our server never came back to ask how our meal was or give us a check. So I decided to talk to the woman in charge. She did take my receipt,comped the bill and apologized saying they were just busy. No excuse but Fine. Now all 3 of us who ordered the crab cakes have the WORST explosive diarrhea! Thanks so much. Yeah are meal was free but we're still paying. This place is probably the WORST restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office and I have gone now a few times. The service is fast and the food is decent. They also offer a few unique items (like a buffalo burger) and the chicken dishes have been great!
Price is good but don't expect anything fancy there. It is a very basic kinda a bar feel, kinda a restaurant feel.
Overall I liked it and will go back!"}
{"text":"Don't bother ... rattlesnake of a bartender.. ( Erica)... tried on least 4 occasions... go elsewhere... not friendly poor service... ( no service) stiffed her... well did leave a 8 pennies... pathetic... and tip well!! Done don't go there"}
{"text":"If terrible service and bombastic, arrogant management is your pleasure, then Steve's is the place. 
My friends are in music, so after Symphony performances,  we had a couple times stopped at this place for the patio seating and some tasty burgers or grill fare. Last visit was our LAST. The waiter was slow, ungracious ( no please or thank you even), incompetent ( waited for food to chill before bringing out flatware), and when asked about an error on the check, downright rude.
Waiter is evidently part of the \"family business\" judging by the resemblance to the even ruder guy in charge, who came out to verify the error. ((He had a special posted on the promo chalkboard he was refusing to recognize.) He acted as if we had insulted them by asking for a corrected bill...and after a few words to point out the mistake, to emphasize how little our money meant to him, instead of re-ringing us, he took a big, grubby roll of small bills out of his pocket and counted out the credit onto a nearby table, right down to the dime. His rudeness and hostility was incredible! He made sure we knew how inconsequential our small party was to him.
NEVER GOING BACK. The food was ok...like a hundred other places. We use Switch or a nearby grill for after-music dinners now!"}
{"text":"Not great food. Very slow service. No utensils when our food came after 25 minutes.  The people next to us arrived after us, got their food and left before we got our food. Pancakes were marginal. Only fruit was cantaloupe and watermelon. This place doesn't get breakfast."}
{"text":"went here tonight for happy hour before the DBacks game.  Took about 10 minutes for the waitress to visit us.  i should mention the place was nearly empty.  Waters took another 10 minutes.  when we ordered, the waitress asked us if we were here for happy hour and we said yes; my friend ordered wings and i ordered a salad, both from the HH menu.  Food came about 20 minutes later and was very good.  waitress checked in on us once then we had to flag her down to get our check quite a while later.  we asked her to split my beer and salad & friend's beer and wings on our cards.  although the wings are listed on the HH menu, and waitress knew we were there ordering for HH, wings were billed at full price.  Flagged down to ask about this and she said \"the wings are not on happy hour.\"  ????  um, yes they are, and again she repeats that they are not, regardless that it's written in black & white on the menu.  she gives us no explanation, just that they're not on happy hour.  then she got irritated we didn't understand this.  she said she meant to tell us this but kept forgetting.  apparently the wings, although again, on the HH menu, are NOT on HH on game nights.  this is mentioned no where, written no where, and was not told to us when we ordered.  fail fail fail.  the waitress was unapologetic, abrupt with us, unwaivering, and didn't give a crap that this was on her to mention from the get-go, not once we get the bill and have to ask about it.  between her shitty attitude, crappy customer service, and the 'customer should know what's on the HH menu and what's not, regardless of what's actually written on the HH menu' policy, there is no need for me to patronize this place again.   too bad, because the guitarest was awesome.
i know it's not a huge deal, but the waitress handled this completely wrong, knew it, and did nothing to remedy and learn from it.  i was a waitress for a long time; takes A LOT for me to leave a crappy tip.  this gal got a $2 tip for her efforts.  maybe that'll get her attention."}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant for breakfast, because it was close to my overpriced hotel. The food and service was mediocre.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros ($9), in which the beans were cold and the  fried potatoes were not cooked completely. A cup of average coffee cost me $2.75.

I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Went here for the DTPHX wine walk and it was the most disappointing of the few stops we made. A pitiful small poor plus we had to pay tax on top of the $3 wine walk sample price, they were the only place that did that and everyone involved in the walk was only carrying cash so that seemed weird. The food was serve yourself and was a bread and spaghetti sauce. Considering the free advertising that a public event like that provides you would think they would put in more effort. It is how you are representing your restaurant. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance!  Our server was great and our food came out fast.  I ordered the Greek omelette and was delicious and right on point.  We were in town for a volleyball tournament and even though they were busy we were sat down within 5 minutes.  There was a bear table that had a bad experience but for what I witness their waitress Moe was great.  She handle it very professional and the other guests were unreasonable and rude! I would definitely recommend this place and if I had more time I would come for lunch!"}
{"text":"Place was pretty empty on a sunday before a d-backs game. Service was good, waitress came back frequently to check on us. The caesar salad was huge and good value, had lots of cheese, fresh lettuce, with wonton strips on top instead of croutons, which were very good.   The kids had quesadillas, which were average and yummy shoestring fries. My wiofe had grilled vegetable bruschetta, which was just sauteed veggies in a bowl, with garlic bread on the side. While tasty, not your Postino bruschetta, needed more pesto on the veggies.  Overall, good place to go before a game, or lunch during the week."}
{"text":"The manager who helped get our food was impatient and ride. After we showed our frustration with her, she tried being nice but it was definitely not genuine. The food wasn't that great, I would recommend trying elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there, ordered eggs over easy, came to the table after a long wait, very well done, took another 15 mins for redo (one other couple in entire restaurant). No offer of coffee refills.  Had to ask for bill.  Waiter took his time to bring bill, came back after another 15 mins to cash out.  

ROTTEN service...food just ok...NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Had meatloaf, avoid it the tomato sauce is vinaigrette based.  Portions are small and dried out.  Friend had chicken fried steak extremely large plate size steak.  Tasty

I really enjoyed the white bean chili.  Soft taste not to big with the smokey flavor.  

Service was horrible.  Our waitress disappeared?  Manager seemed repugnant even when we walked our ticket to her to pay.  Had to wait until the end of the meal for water refills and had to get the bus boy to help us.  

Low cost food, but there are so many better choices downtown. Skip this place.  You will not miss it."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place four stars... But I think I needed to sit in the outdoor seating for a better experience. 

Regardless I really find the servers and staff to be so friendly here. The atmosphere seems outdated but a good place to grab a quick bite. My experience would have probably been better if I sat outside because it seems they have live music there every night. 

 The menu is so large with numerous options. I think anyone could find something to eat there.  The salad was fresh and a larger size. I recommend this location for a good meal- it's not fancy, and not anything amazing, but we had a good dinner and would visit again."}
{"text":"Great place near the convention center for breakfast lunch or dinner. I had salmon dinner which was good and then breakfast this morning which was very good as well. Wait staff has been very friendly and attentive both times. Would recommend this place to visitors to avoid high cost of hotel food."}
{"text":"Burger was over cooked and both my friend's and my burgers were nasty soggy. Frys had no flavor. Server forgot my order of chips & salsa but tried to keep it on my bill. She also forgot my friend's guacamole and also tried to charge him for it. Gave us attitude when we questioned it. Place is dirty and lame."}
{"text":"Agonizingly slow service. Tepid, mediocre food. Salsa from a jar."}
{"text":"Pretty consistent spot for lunch. Love the daily special price and variety. The tots are great!"}
{"text":"Actually just now leaving the restaurant because me and three friends went in, sat down, and waited over 20 minutes to be greeted. The hostess saw us waiting and pretty sure the server who was only two tables away from us must have noticed us too. Everyone else who got sat after us at least had a server say hello to them. The restaurant wasn't even busy. Whenever we got up and left no one said a word to us. 
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here one night right before 11pm after a concert. We walked up to the door and saw the hours posted on the door saying they close at 11, so we turned around and started walking away when a waiter opens the door and tells us \"We're open!\" so we go inside.  I believe they're open until 2am on Saturday night.

We are vegan and this restaurant is not geared towards the vegan crowd; however, they do have a garden burger on their menu.  They were so kind to make vegetable fajitas for my husband.  There drinks were superb with the Cadillac margarita being one of the best my husband has had!

Tony was our server and he was amazing! We sure enjoyed talking with him.  He loves working there and was so enthusiastic about his job (his 2nd job for many years) and his family. 

The atmosphere here is 2 stars but you need to overlook that.  The patio is way nicer than the inside. 

Give this place a try and support a locally owned business in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience ! Waited 30 minutes for food, only to be told they had 1 chef and the 2 items we had ordered were out. Reordered  different things, after another 30 minutes still no food. Paid for our drinks and left hungry. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"The wings were great, but service ruined it for all of us. The staff was very rude, their door said they closed at 1am and we got wings at 11pm and they made us eat outside on the sidewalk because the guy wanted to go home. Never going back."}
{"text":"I think my experience was similar to other reviewers' experiences.  Great food, lousy service.  At first, we had two waiters who both thought they had our table, but we were ignored for a while.  Thanks for bringing the side of BBQ sauce after I finished my burger!

But I really enjoyed the food, and would go back for that."}
{"text":"Steve's is a cool concept, but not executed very well.  They offer a pretty good selection of vegetarian items, and the location is decent.  I love their  dedication to freshness.

The problem, for me, was the not-so-clean restaurant.  It was DIRTY.  The container the glasses were in, the table, the seats, the floors, everything.  I would like to blame this on a busy morning, but we were there first thing.  We were the first people to sit at the table for the day.  GROSS.

The food was ok, but I had a really hard time getting over the dirtiness.

Clean up, Steve's!"}
{"text":"I AM A FAN !!! am a believer (:  I LOVEEE THIS PLACE! 
-service was nothing less then outstanding and I am super picky when it comes to Good service! The help was delightful laughing along with us and making sure our every need or want was taken care of ... On top of everything else the food is delicious - anything and everything  try it all! I have so many dishes there I can't begin to start but Trust me you will be one happy camper when you leave!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Ask for medium well burger. It was rare. Sweet tea from a fountain. Servers were very nice. Fire the cook!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow.  Our soups arrived cool to the touch.  Asked for hot soup, it took 20 minutes.  Ordered two salads.  One arrived without bread.  Asked for bread.  Never saw the waitress again   Asked another worker if we could have the check from our MIA waitress.  He said yes.  10 minutes later no check. 

Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"The service was lousy. Our waitress didn't bring out our drinks for 20 minutes and we had to flag her down just to get those drinks. We were essentially ignored the entire night as she  never checked up on us, or refilled our drinks and the restaurant was not busy so there was no excuse for her lousy service. We had to flag her down again just to get our bill. The restaurant wasn't busy which was strange because this was right before an event. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It had no flavor. If you are seeking simple bar food, I would recommend Jacksons on Third and Cooperstown over this place. I would even recommend the Matador restaurant next door. We won't be coming back and I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"What a mistake I made eating breakfast here!

The older woman acting as hostess was a frenzied, over-bearing ball of stress, even though the restaurant wasn't all that busy. I saw her irk numerous customers with her behavior. She kept a long line of customers standing out front, waiting to be seated, for about 15 minutes, even though there were several empty tables on the patio and inside. She shouted orders to the various wait staff and rushed around, very unprofessionally and unnecessarily.

I asked for a side of milk with my tea when I ordered my breakfast. The tea was served sans milk, so when I could finally get my waitress's attention (about 10 minutes into my meal), I requested the milk again. She said she'd go grab it. By the end of my meal, I still didn't have it, so I asked for the tea to be removed from my bill. No one apologized to me for the SNAFU. My waitress even acted irritated with me about it.

The food was actually decent (I had the huevos rancheros), so it was extra disappointing that the restaurant had so many other issues."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special. Bar food at its most average. The service is inconsistent, but prompt. The beer selection is pretty decent. Overall, you could do worse, but it's cheapish and convenient if you happen to be around the convention center."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times now. First experience was on-point, which led the the second visit. Unfortunately, service fell way way short.

Five different people came to our table and we were iust there for breakfast. This was immediately after we heard that we would have to wait 15 minutes for a server.  The place was slow by the way. Then, delicious food arrived, but no one checked in at all with us. Coffee cup was empty and toast that came with meal never showed up. We actually got the bill and then the toast showed up afterwards. 

The thing is, I really want this place to succeed. The food is good and the location is great.  Management...wake up!!!"}
{"text":"This fod is pretty good - I recommend the crab cake sandwich or the cajun sausage sandwich.  If you're not concerned about calories, they do a really good job with their fries.  The service is unpredictable - sometimes it's better on the patio."}
{"text":"OUTMOTHERFACKINGSTANDING!!!!!!!!!
Loved this experience!!!!!  Started off with the fried wontons with salsa and guac.  Was incredible, I say again, INCREDIBLE!  I asked our waitress if the salsa was made in house, IT WAS MOTHER TRUCKERS and the guac too.  The salsa tasted extremely fresh and the guac was chunky and tasty as eff.  I wanted to hug the guy who made it.  But sadly he wasnt there.

On to the burgers.  The girfriend unit and myself both got bacon cheeseburgers.  The burgers were perfectly cooked to medium and medium well.  The seasoning made the burg.  Facking amazing and crispy ass tots to boot.

Any time i find myself in downtown Phoenix i will be thinking of eating here.  LOVED IT!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Literally terrible. Enough said.
*Can't get a refill of water
*Ordered a sausage burrito and got a salami burrito 
*Didn't get jam for my toast
*Couldn't get a mimosa refill 
*The list goes on, etc..."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here for lunch, dinner & Happy-Hour... I've had soups, shrimp-n-chips, pasta dishes, steak... (practically the whole menu) & I've always been pleased w/ my food. I'm partial to their fries as well. Great Margaritas (try the Coyote & the Pomegranate) The shakes & floats are pretty yummy as well.

One of the main reasons I like come is *because* of the staff... They've always been friendly & funny & quite entertaining. I'm a patron that likes to interact w/ who-ever is serving me. 

Seating is plentiful inside & out. The bar seating itself is a little small-ish. Friendly diner-feel inside. 

Steve's comes highly recommended from me ;)"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Forgot our drinks and they served our mimosa's in plastic cups. They accommodated my vegan friend but I'm not a fan of them saying the rice was vegan then saying it wasn't and just removing it from the dish before asking us"}
{"text":"Onions rings tasty - service bad
I should have listened to all the rest of the reviews. But we were hungry, at the convention center and not wanting to walk to far.
We also wanted to eat outside.

Our server was terrible. He offered not options when we asked what was on tap and if they had any wheat beers. He said they didn't have any and didn't offer up the drink menu. Sigh.

We started with the \"spicy\" onion rings. Basically onions rings sprinkled with season sauce. Tasty none the less, although not spicy!
I did a chicken sandwich - they did not cut the tendon out, so chomping into that sucked. The coleslaw was ok.
Hubby wanted the Cajun sausage sandwich and said - the Cajun sausage. Also said no veggies. The waiter assumed he wanted the main pasta dish...  which was awful. Tasteless Alfredo sauce.
Our companion for the meal got the crab cake sandwich, he didn't want the wheat bun and his only other options was sour dough bread.
The crab was not tasty.

The front patio is a great location to hang out, but just don't go with great expectations. And grab a drink menu on the way in!"}
{"text":"Wow, I've had some bad experiences at restaurants, but never anything like this. It looked it it was going to be a bad lunch when I ordered an arnold palmer and it came out and tasted like tea and water, none of the sweetness of the lemonade, luckily I was able to swap it out for a coke. We asked about the beer specials and our waiter couldn't remember, but stood there for a while trying to, but then gave up.The drunken chicken sandwich was slathered in buffalo sauce instead of the chipotle remoulade which I ordered. The chipotle mac and cheese which was described as penne, came out as spaghetti. When we asked about silverware we were directed to the jars full of knives and forks but no spoons. Storing silverware on the table is disgusting, who knows what was done to it before we sat down. We sat for a while waiting for our check before finally having to ask someone to send our waiter back with it."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good (despite being overpriced for the portion size) but the service was absolutely atrocious... We were seated then it was about 10 minutes before we even got water (which the host had to get us). Then it took another 20 minutes to have our order taken (drinks & food at the same time due to how long it took). It was another 10 minutes before our partial & incorrect drinks were brought out then another 5 to correct it. We were told 4 times that our food was coming right up which turned out to be almost an hour. At first they brought out only 3 of our 6 plates (none of which were for the 3 hungry & cranky kids). It took almost 10 more minutes to bring out the next 2 plates followed by another 5 minute wait for the 5 y/o's plate (who was darn near in tears because she was so hungry). You'd think after taking that long the orders would at least be correct, right? Nope, 2 of them were wrong... On top of all this, they completely forgot about our appetizers we ordered until we were pretty much done with the food. It seems like this place is severely understaffed but the host blamed it on the waiter & the waiter on the kitchen. All in all, unless that place hires more or better staff, we will never be returning (which is sad being as the food was pretty darn good). So if you have children or are hungry, stay away!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just hungry but the pattymelt was REALLY GOOD!   They offer tater tots on the menu which I thought was different.   They have grill potatoes that are fantastic.  Good hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Food is pricey and didn't look very good. Too bad nothing around was open. As the food came out, I'm glad all I ordered was a beer. Looked like a dirty diner with the employees just sitting around watching tv bc there were no guests. Won't be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"Good food and great drinks. Am visiting Phoenix for 5 days and I will definitely return! Great place to get drinks and talk with friends."}
{"text":"I was eyeing the street taco platter and my waiter recommended it... he also let me know I could order tacos individually, which I opted for instead... Too bad he forgot to mention that it's just a tortilla and meat... and NOT the street tacos... so the tacos get a 1 Star... (bland but not tasteless) but I may have changed my order had I known they came naked.

Fortunately I also ordered chips and salsa, so at least I was able to drop some of that on there.

Decent Bloody Mary and I liked the wonton chips... Though \"dusted w/Cajun seasoning\" should be used very loosely. The salsa had a nice kick to it. 

For being an essentially empty establishment when I arrived, service was in the slower side, but more frequent check-ins once he got us started... and was friendly.

The place was average. 2.5 stars if I could, but I'll go 3."}
{"text":"Colorful place - literally. The decor and lights make for a casual atmosphere that puts you at ease when you enter. My friend and I came here late in the evening, near closing time when it wasn't busy anymore.  There were just a few guys inside relaxing and having their meals and drinks. We ordered burgers - with fried onion straws for me, ostrich burgers for my friend, and we both agreed that the burgers were good. The fries were cut thin, almost shoestring style, and unfortunately were too dry. For the friendly service, relaxing atmosphere, and our not-too-spectacular food experience, I'd give the place 3 stars."}
{"text":"I realize this restaurant was busy during mid-SB week, as I'm a very patient person.  Compounding things is I became very ill on my vacation and needed a comforting meal.  What followed was the most bizarre dining experience that I've had in many years.

First I was ignored for a good 20 minutes after being seated. A manager saw me being kinda ignored and got the drink.  Later had to specially ask for water (I had requested it but it was forgotten).

Then to the entree.  I needed fairly healthy and plain (not fried).  So even though I'm a burgers and wings kinda guy, I opted for the grilled tilapia entree with red potato.  My server talked me out of the potato and said that the sliced version was tasty but not greasy.  She insisted I wasn't entitled to a dinner roll or a choice of soup or side salad as the menu stated.

A tilapia sandwich arrived, clearly with the plain fish and fixins on an open bun. The sliced potatoes were fried like french fries, draped in grease. I questioned this to my server and she insisted that this was indeed the entree.  When the manager was roving around, she asked me if there was an issue and I explained.  She shook her head, apologized (server is newer) and offered to get me the entree with salad.  Super nice lady, I can tell she was juggling lots.

Then the server came over (while redo was in the works) and said she was sorry and how come I didn't let her know there was an issue.  Yes, I did, at ordering the entree (wasn't this to include soup or salad etc) and upon arrival (hey this looks like a sandwich, not an entree). Incredible.

So the meal arrives and the fish, instead of tender and soft like the sandwich version, is close to a chew toy in terms of being overcooked.  I mean, really.

The final perplexing aspect is when I ordered a turkey wrap to go.  I specifically asked that the wrap not be heavy in dressing. The server told me that dressing came on the side; I reiterated how I was ill and needed no/little oil in the wrap. Of course, the wrap I received was lathered on dressing.  Lathered, saturated.

To recap, slow indifferent service unless a manager notices.  Servers who don't know their own menu and take no initiative to verify what the customer will receive. And oh by the way, when I returned to my hotel afterwards, I lost my lunch in its entirety.

Maybe this place would be great if just ordering burgers and fries during a non-busy time of year and from a knowledgeable server.  But this was my experience."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. Service was very poor. Food was average. I ordered a chicken club and had to flag a server to get mayo. The server forgot our water."}
{"text":"Here for breakfast. I had a breakfast wrap kind of thing and it was pretty good. The coffee was pretty good as well, but the service was really slow. I mean to the point that I began to despair of ever getting any more water or coffee to drink. The place itself is pretty dark and rather claustrophobic inside. It also has a sort of smoky kind of smell about it. All it all, it was better than McDonalds, but I have not made a huge effort to return. If I was starving, and there was no other place around, then yeah, I would come back for breakfast, but hey, there are a lot of better options around in close walking distance."}
{"text":"Got the cowboy burger, it was pretty good. But the bun was on able to keep up with the burger. I like to be able to eat my sandwich mop it up. The parts were amazing love those crispy, fluffy tater tots!"}
{"text":"Wow, if I could give zero stars I would. Following the symphony yesterday five of us chose Steve's over one across the street and an hour and half later we were furious we had made the change. We waited 10 minutes for water; another 5-10 to place an order and another 35 for our food. It was not very full at that time. Every patron in the place was ready to walk out. We chatted with several people around us. Not only did we wait over 45 minutes for burgers, they came out cold - cold enough they were practically inedible. The crab sandwich was equally as bad. We discovered our waitress was the manager and when we called her attention to the food, she did offer to re-cook the three burgers, but we had no desire to sit for another half hour waiting for that to happen. The service and the food were terrible. We discussed not paying or walking out even before the food came out, but we chose to be polite. Don't waste any money or time on this restaurant. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Super Great Local spot next to the Phoenix convention center with FAB happy hour prices on drinks $5 HUGE burgers and 50cent wings with your choice of sauces. Each day of the week has a different special so keep your eyes open if your nearby. The staff was fun and charismatic. They also offer a great home cooked breakfast starting at 6:30AM that doesnt break the bank. I couldn't of wished for a better place to set up camp while I was in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way to the airport from the Sheraton downtown.  I was giving a ride to some out-of-town guests and we just needed a quick bite.

Liked the atmosphere.  Didn't like that they allow smoking on the pation (\"only in the corners\", but the smoke smell prevailed over the entire patio).  Good friendly service.  The ostrich burger was interesting.  I had it done MR (chef's rec), and it seemed a little pink but moist.   My guests also had the ostrich burger (but overdone) and a regular burger (which looked scrumptious)."}
{"text":"Okay I get it, down low place, good bar, bare bones.  BUT, I was drawn to Steve's by the street live music, cool down home atmosphere and the genuine friendliness of the staff.  Taco Tuesday 2 for $2 and drink specials- plus a fixings bar.  Pretty cool"}
{"text":"Boo. Been here 3 times and 1 time out of 3, i received adequate service. Slow and you are left hanging. Dont go here if u have somewhere to be anytime soon. The positives: outdoor patio and live music on some evenings. Prices are reasonable and the menu is vast. The negatives: the silverware is kept in a jar on the table. Thats not very sanitary, especially in AZ with blowing dust and bugs. Getting to the restroom is just odd. U sort of walk in a hallway that runs thru the kitchen/backroom. And the service is slooooow! I decided to give them a lil rest after the 3rd time in didnt go so well service-wise."}
{"text":"Staff was super accommodating. Beer durning happy hour was CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. I would back in a New York second. The calamari was excellent.  The burgers looked awesome. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Bartender was mean. Wouldn't let us sit at the bar even though there were four chairs open. She said the empty seats were for people outside smoking. We ended up leaving and I noticed no one outside was smoking. This was during Phoenix Comicon- guess she didn't like cosplayers. We were offered table by the misters, however when in costume not a good idea to get wet. Oh well."}
{"text":"It might be comic fest weekend, but there's no excuse for the awful service we received. It wasn't THAT busy, from what we could see most of the tables were empty. It took over fifteen minutes just to have a waitress approach our table. Then we waited another twenty minutes and we still hadn't even been given water or coffee. I don't mind waiting for food because it's probably busier than they're used to, but there is NO REASON we should have to wait 35+ minutes just to get a cup of coffee. We ended up just leaving. So thanks for wasting our time, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the hostess not only checked on us after we were sat but cleared our plates and got our check for us when our waitress was nowhere to be found. 

We sat, the restaurant wasn't busy. Took 5 minutes for our waitress to show up and then waited for 10 minutes for our waters. The bacon cheeseburgers were dry and the fries were cold. The atmosphere was nothing special and the music was so loud I could hardly hold a conversation with the person across me. If you're in a hurry then avoid this place."}
{"text":"Burger Night in downtiwn Phoenix finds me at Steve's. Bartender Mike Lowery suggested the super cheese burger with jalapeño. EXCELLENT with the grilled potatoes.

Sitting at the bar watching the D-Backs vs Rangers. Life is good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, the hostess seemed to be out there not quite awake, the food was good but the service was the worse I've ever had. We waited close to an hour for our food because we were told the big group was ahead of us yet we put our order in before they were seated......we had to ask for silverware, then napkins and then ketchup.....our waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for these things.....we weren't the only ones waiting forever the table next to us that we were talking with were waiting forever also.......will never go back would never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews bought a Groupon anyways, I'm willing to give a place a try to form my own opinion. It wasn't over-the-top awesome but it wasn't awful either. Our drinks and food arrived in a timely manner, though the waiter did seem to be a bit of a space cadet. We had 2 cheeseburgers and the ostrich burger, everyone ate up with no complaint. Won't go out of my way to eat here but wouldn't avoid it either."}
{"text":"I would not recommend Steve's Greenhouse Grill. The service is terrible. We were seated 10 minutes before my husband got up to ask if they forgot about us 20 minutes before we got our drinks. They are not even busy."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!! After we got our food, we never saw another worker again. I couldn't even get a soda because I could not find anybody. Once we did, the girls who did work there were sitting in a booth eating dinner and when I had to get my fiance to get up and ask for our check they looked at him like how dare you bother us.  Will never go again. Food had no flavor what so ever."}
{"text":"So on Saturday evening during Comic Con we venture down here to grab some food. Been a long weekend already, quite hungry. Most of us already know this is not the best place downtown to eat, but its late. Venture in at 10:34, very not busy at all. So we get drinks, a few just get water and a couple cups of coffee. Now 11:10 ish, we have been talking to another server who is not our server about events around the convention, wondering if he has seen our server, people want a refill on drinks, questions about where the food is. 11:17 or so the server we had been speaking to gets the manager for us and begins telling us how busy they are. Actually, the entire inside is a ghost town, they are still seating what few people are walking up on the patio. As my friend Ryan is dicussing what is going on with the manager, the onion rings arrive almost an hour after we were seated. Like four people reach for one at the same time, not even hot, as we get up to leave, the balls displayed by this manager asking if we were gonna pay for the drinks was just astounding."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place. The waitress is not polite, the hamburger was really soggy the bun fell apart I couldn't even eat it. I used a knife and a fork to eat my hamburger. Also I asked for crispy fries it was not well done at all."}
{"text":"I like this place. They accommodated our bicycle club with reserved seating on a Saturday and even allowed our Acoustic band (The OddBalls) to get up on stage and play a few songs. The beer is cold the food is good. I took advantage of the daily special; Miller High Life pint and $5 burger. I chose The Chili Burger. Nice options available; poblano, jalapeños, verde or red chili. Side options were good too: fries, tater tots, cottage cheese or cole slaw. I chose poblano and tater tots"}
{"text":"Just slightly off the beaten path but right next to the Hyatt Regency is this great little dive called Steve's. They had a cool acoustic guitar player out front so we thought we'd give it a try on Saturday afternoon. 

We were sat promptly and got drinks pretty quick too. 3 of us had cheeseburgers of various kinds and the burgers were all so big nobody could finish them! But boy were they delish! Seasoned nicely and just perfectly done. The fries were shoestring kind and they were crispy and well seasoned with a blend of tastes as well; not just salt which made them super yum.  One of us got the crab cake appetizer as a meal and it was just the right kid size serving for kids who like \"crabby patties\". The crab cakes were pretty good though. What was amazingly good are their onion rings. These had just a kick of spicyness to them with a kicky ranch dip. They were remarkably good and I will return to Steve's if not for anything else than the onion rings.

The service was hit and miss. Our server tended to forget about us once the appetizers were served and drinks went empty for longer than I prefer. But the food was good enough that I will come back again next time I'm downtown. 

FINALLY someplace that is half-way decent, fairly priced, and IS NOT the HRC."}
{"text":"All I can say is O-M-G!  This is my first visit here and I don't think I'll be back )at least during lunch time).  I was completely appalled by what took place in this establishment today.  My co-worker and I had placed a pick up order and while we waited to be served we watched the staff and manager treat these customers horribly! 
A silent spoken man walked up to the bar area to \"Kathy\" asking if she could get his server so they could check out.  She (Kathy) snapped and yelled at the gentleman saying \"I am not your server... There are four other people ahead of you... \"Can't you see I'm busy\".  My co-worker and I were blown away.  The man and his female companion (friend, girlfriend, wife...whatever) then asked for the manager or owner.  Another short hairs blond woman appeared and states she was the manager.  This lady, the so called manager then started to yell at this couple.  I was blown away.  There are so many choices for eateries in the downtown area to choose from that one would think you'd try to keep your customers.  
I will say the food was good, but the service from the bartender \"Kathy\" and this \"manager\" was unbelievable.  A BIG SMH!!!"}
{"text":"Late night desparation, dining disappointment. My friends and I decided to hit a downtown dining spot after a concert. Steve's was the only restaurant still open. They get 1 star for being open on a Saturday night. The blue cheese dressing tasted homemade and was full of yummy chunks.  Other than that, the service was poor and the food was blah. Whatever you do, don't order the rib tip basket. Ribs are chewy and greasy and COLD.  

Won't ever go here again. Pass it up."}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams of mediocrity. The food, the service, the décor. Even the TV disappointed (a bit).  If you like wilted lettuce and the slight chance of food poisoning, enjoy.  Fine, the beer selection was okay."}
{"text":"I've read most of the reviews and am surprised at some of them.  We have been staying at the Hyatt Regency for the week, and on the second day here discovered Steve's Greenhouse Grill.  Thought we'd go in and try it out and are so glad we did...

We have eaten there most every day now while here.  

The SERVICE we received was great!!  Very prompt and constantly right on top of things.  My thanks especially to Kathy and to Mo for the attention they paid to us while we enjoyed the place.

The food comes in AMPLE servings.... (used to be a day I could finish it all)... :)   We tried a variety of items and were not disappointed with any of them.  The food quality I would put on the lines of \"cafe\" cooking/food.    

Loved the onion straws... and they know how to cook one heck of a good Ribeye steak!!!!

I would personally suggest that if you want a place to eat with good food, good service (was for us), good portions at good prices, stop in and see Kathy or Mo.  Tell them I sent you."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Steve's. The food is great, the portions are generous, and the service is top notch. Our server kathy was prompt and paid just enough attention to us to let us know she was looking out for us but not smother us. You know the kind of servers I'm talking about. Their $4 root beer floats are awesome. Be sure to stop in and grab one if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"We were in town for  a conference and stumbled across this place our first night in town and we Loved IT! The burgers and grill potatoes were excellent. The next night we went to Hard Rock and were very disappointed because we had Steve's the night before and it was so much better. We could not stop thinking about how good it was, so we went back another day for their Wing Special. Again we were very pleased. Everything tasted so good and the service was really good.  Prices are very reasonable. We might even go back there again tomorrow for lunch. There were 7 in our group and every one of us Loved our food!"}
{"text":"The location downtown was ideal for us and they have outdoor dining and offer 50% off parking.

Plus, they had a sign welcoming the gymnastics girls to the convention center so that scored points to my daughter, a gymnast.

She had a kids meal with cheese quesadilla, fruit and decaf coffee which they brewed fresh for her. ($5.50)

I had a breakfast burro with egg, cheese, green chili and potato.  I'm not sure there were potatoes in it?  Served with salsa and guacamole and a side of fruit for $8.  The burrito was bland.  Got iced tea served in a nice huge cup for $2.75,"}
{"text":"This place has bad reviews on Around Me so I was expecting a bad experience and bad food.  I mean. It's a bar. But the food was very good and I was seated immediately and very prompt courteous service.  No complaints.  I recommend it. Didn't try the coffee.  I'm going to Starbucks next."}
{"text":"This is place is horrible, avoid at all costs. The French fries were mushy, the fried fish was also soggy. The bus boy brought us our tab without us even asking for it ?? I was really disappointed and upset that I ate here"}
{"text":"We came at 7 pm on Saturday of Comic-Con. We were told out would be 10 minutes for a rabble of two. 25 minutes later, they claimed they'd called us and we'd never responded. We were standing 10 feet from the host stand. When we were finally seated--only after making a stink--it took almost 20 minutes and two requests to even hear from a server, who still has said almost nothing to us. We ordered a salad, which was the most threadbare sad looking salad I've ever seen. It was half stringy, preshredded lettuce, and half heart of a  iceberg left uncut. I dread how the entree is going to come out."}
{"text":"The good - very cute place & great live music.

The bad - Brought here from a Restaurant.com coupon, and naturally had a three course meal for very cheap (thankfully because we are never coming back)

The food is very mediocre, I ordered the southern fried chicken and it was average, about as good as you would find anywhere else. The BLT my girlfriend had was again, average, nothing spectacular. The fried ice cream for dessert was nearly impossible to eat because of how hard it was. 

However what really tipped the scale on poor ratings was the HORRIBLE service. The server knew nothing about the drinks, was unresponsive or un-knowledgeable on any of the questions and was EXTREMELY rude, short and snappy. The server was also VERY slow - slow on refills, slow to bring the check, everything! (I ended up leaving cash when I wanted to pay with card because I was sick of waiting!!)

 I am a VERY good tipper, and was extremely upset I had to pay the 18% gratuity; if that were not included she would of gotten no more than 10% for her horrible service!

BAD BAD BAD SERVICE!!

Won't be back.

Beware - generic food, horrible service."}
{"text":"No wonder this was the only places with open seating after the suns game. When we got there we asked for a sampler platter to start. We were told \"im too busy for that, anything but that.\" We then were told he thought he was out of wontons but he would check (he never did). We were given a total of 1 min to look at the menu before being asked to order (not if we had enough time to look). I got the chicken cordon blue. After each of us said our order the waiter responded \"ok give me your menu\". Food came quick but there was a reason for this. I got a grilled cheese with what tasted like a microwaved chicken patty on it. My friend got the fettachini which i was told had less flavor then a microwave dinner. My other friend didnt have complaints on the burger hence the star i gave them."}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews but when your doors say a time you are open, typical good business practice is to be open on the states hours.  Then when employees came outside I asked about when they open, to which they replied \"later\". Ok, thanks, won't come back."}
{"text":"Nice location with good outside seating area. They have live music sitting outside in front of the resturant with great singers!
Service was so great! Absolutely friendly and taking care. Good selection of local beers to very good price level.

Unfortunately the burger was not meeting my exectations; std. pattie with sticky bun... This can be done better. At the end I was so satisfied with the good service staff, so that I can provide four stars :)"}
{"text":"Horrible soggy mess. Ordered a Reuben. Took one bite an thr meat is so tough it came all out at once. Bland. Never again."}
{"text":"The food is good, price is reasonable but the menu is confusing. It is not clear which sides come with what kind of food. Make sure you check that before ordering extra sides."}
{"text":"Steve's was located right between my hotel and the convention center where I was working. It hit the spot for a quick morning breakfast. We were there the first week of April and probably ate at Steve's at least once a day. The weather was wonderful so we took advantage of the outdoor seating. Service was a bit slow, but I appreciated the pace as I wasn't in a huge hurry. The food was always delicious."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Service was pure torture. The waitress had me feeling bad for ordering everything I ordered like it was a burden to her! Veggies were delicious steak was not bad for it not being a steakhouse! I won't be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Steve's Grill for years for lunch.  They have a great location and their food is really tasty.  I like their staff. They're friendly and fast.  The parking can be an issue if you're driving.  But I'm within walking distance of my office, so it's not a problem.  I'm able to grab a bite to eat and get back to work in plenty of time.  I've brought many friends and co-workers here and they've never been disapointed.  I'll continue coming here as long as the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite after a longggg day at work after stopping at 2 other places downtown.  Enjoyed a classic cheeseburger complimented by tater tots!   Thank God I got ignored at the other 2 places!  They have been here 42 years and I can see why.  

Food is great and the service is excellent!  Tony checked on me to make sure I was taken care of when I was seated.  Super guy, shared with a little history of Steve's with me.  

Experience went to the great level when Karla came to take my order.  She recommended mopthe cheeseburger with tater tots and it was a home run!  She swung by to check on me often and made sure my drink stayed topped off. Karla made it a great experience!

They serve breakfast,  Tony recommends the Meat Loaf and eggs,  I'm planning on coming back tomorrow morning to try it. 

Bonus plan, Julia Grayling played the guitar and sang this evening   She has a lovely voice and wrote some great songs."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Open at 6:30am (every day of the week). I had the Mexican Omelette- very good (very hot-spicy). My wife had biscuits and gravy, and she said the biscuits were tender and fluffy, the gravy had bits of sausage, and the half order was just the right amount."}
{"text":"I used to think this place was pretty good to get a quick burger from a few years ago during PCC times. The food wasn't bad, but the best thing of note was their tater tots. I would consider the place a three star average despite moments of slowdown due to handling the crowds of people. Fast forward to now and the place has gone downhill steadily. Service got slower. People got angrier. Average food became bad food because everything else was negative. The only positive I can give about this place is that you get a chair to sit in to relax a little after walking all day. 

I can't say anything negative about the manager as I never had to deal with him and most times, the servers were good to me. I seem to be one of the luckier ones in this regard though. Unfortunately, it's not worth it to come here. Either eat in the convention halls, the food trucks, or walk a block or two for a better experience."}
{"text":"Good food. Awful service. The waiter was nowhere to be found when we needed our check, even though we slotted 2 hrs to get through our meal, kept our order super simple, & told our server upfront when we needed to leave. We had to ask 2 other staff and finally chase him down on foot as he walked away while we continually said \"excuse me.\" I won't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a movie one night and it was a fun little find. We just wanted to grab a beer and have an appetizer. We got their chicken fingers, which were very good and hit the spot. The best part though was finding that they have hop knot! Maybe the only place downtown that does now;) We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The manager here is beyond horrible. She fought with us about a drink order that we have everywhere. To make a dirty martini taste like a olive jar and claim this was perfect is ludicrous. I can not believe she yelled loud enough for customers to hear. The wait staff is fabulous and can't complain their manager is sooooo unprofessional. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"WARNING? I normally never leave reviews but I want to share my experience and warn people to go somewhere else. This was my first time here and it was HORRIBLE!! It took someone 15 minutes to come to our table. Our server was Leandra and she was absolutely the worst server I have ever had! For some reason she had an extremely hard time understanding how we wanted our check separated (we just wanted it split between the two of us). Finally when we got our checks, she ended up charging my card twice!! When I called to speak to a manager about it, she explained the charge was voided but the server failed to let me know before I left the restaurant. Moral of the story, go some where else people!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the rest of the food but the chicken quesadilla and cheese sticks were awesome.  Plus they have $ 2.75 bud and ultra bottles"}
{"text":"Was seated and waited 15 minutes before a waiter came to my table. Poor customer services can't understand how they stay in business."}
{"text":"I've been to Steves a couple times for a late afternoon meal and drinks. It's a nice short walk from the lightrail towards the Hyatt. Every time has been a pretty good experience. The food is good, and the prices aren't that bad.

The thing I want to point out is the drinks; they're fantastic! I'm the guy who doesn't care much for beer and goes for the mixed drinks (go ahead, laugh). Steves has some of the biggest margaritas I've seen. The price isn't too bad and when waiting for your food, it's nice to have that giant drink and enjoy downtown Phoenix with some friends.

The outdoor seating is nice and sheltered by the buildings, so the sun doesn't cook you while your food is being cooked inside. Honestly, I've never sat inside, I love the outdoor seating so much! Bring on the 110 degree heat!"}
{"text":"Review based on service and drinks only because we didn't eat, but we will next time because the food looked great. Anyhoo, this family owned business is beside the Hyatt and an absolute gem in the downtown area. Drinks are cheaper than anywhere we found nearby and it was just a cool spot to check out and spend some time. Wonton chips and salsa were free and delicious. See you guys again in the spring!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waiter goes in back to cook the food. You will not get drink refills and service is really slow. $2 tacos are awful."}
{"text":"Amazing hamburgers, wings and caesar salads!!! Great service to boot! ;)"}
{"text":"Nice little place right across from my hotel. I really enjoyed my Garden Burger. I think the food was great. There was live music being playing which was also very good. I got the Cherry Lemonade Cocktail which was very good it tasted just like frozen lemonade. The service was great."}
{"text":"We stopped in here in the afternoon before heading over to the TalkingStick area to see a concert. What a waste! Service was extremely slow, we asked several times for information on happy hour and finally had to look it up on our phones. People were being served before us, UGH! Sad part was that it wasn't busy, we were one of 3 tables on the patio. The interior had nothing to offer as far as decor.  Drinks took forever! We were trying to avoid a chain establishment and crowds of people and we found it here but the lack of everything will keep us from returning."}
{"text":"Tried to come here for a quick breakfast and to escape the rain (I thought this was Arizona?). It wasn't quick and as it turns out, I would have rather walked in the rain to find a better breakfast option. Spend your time and dollars elsewhere when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Rapid friendly service. Typical Nth American fare. Nothing too spectacular or original. Worked for our family of six. Was convenient for the theatre and got us in and out in plenty of time."}
{"text":"I have to say I am a bit shocked by the reviews.  Our server Lilly was great.  Food came out fairly quickly and was very good.  Will eat breakfast there again this morning.  Only complaint was the beer on tap wasn't very cold, which is a big deal when it's 112 degrees outside.  Would recommend and super convenient to Hyatt."}
{"text":"The beer was ok but the service really turned us off.  The menu says they don't offer the appetizer sampler platter during peak hours.  Apparently, that even means when the place is not busy.  Asked for a beer list and the server told us local brews.  We asked \"what local brews\", she says \"I don't know\".  We then asked if she had a list.  She says \"I don't know, lemme check.\"  10 minutes later, we get a list.  My better half got a margarita which she said was undrinkable.  I took it down mainly so that we could leave.  My group also got an order of potato skins which were edible.  Can't say that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't stop to use the bathroom then eat there. The bartender is the most rude person if the order was not place I would not have stayed after I heard that remark. Ruined my day diem town. So no I won't return. Not a happy camper."}
{"text":"Love the drink specials! But we sat at the bar and our bartender, Erica, was horrible- felt like I was at the MVD office, that bad."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the bar next to the one other guy at the bar... Employees came and went, even hovered at the end of the small bar but never approached us, even though we were clearly looking at them for a drink.. We left after 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to go for a late dinner downtown. Food was simple, but tasty. Our server was AWESOME. We asked him places to recommend for drinks after, and he gave us about 15! He was energetic and really friendly. I'd come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Just like the other reviews say, service is hit or miss. Unfortunately we have only been on the miss days. My wife and I have been here twice, and will not go back. The service is absolutely terrible. From the servers to the hostess, very unprofessional and sometimes outright rude. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. There are too many great places downtown to wast time and money on their poor service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"The wings at this place were great. Just flew in this afternoon and needed a place that wasn't crazy expensive to grab a snack. The waiters were friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"Best. Crab. Cakes!
Restaurant has a very local vibe. Seating area was crowded w/ local folks and out-of-towners. BUT! Without a doubt the crab cakes are delicious. They're not gourmet type more like the cake your grandma would make after picking the meat from crabs she just caught from crabbing. Food isn't pretentious and neither is the crowd. Go for a meal -albeit a lil slow with service - and nice time out."}
{"text":"The service was horrific got ignored by three servers and it was a mess. Sat for 30 minutes before we finally went inside to try the bar and that still took 15 minutes. We even asked for help and were told to wait and then were told she wasn't our server."}
{"text":"I would not eat here! First, smoking is allowed in the outside eating area, the wait is 2+ hours with excuses for everything, flies in most everything, silverware in open cups, worst of all... when I went to nicely state that it had been over 2 hours since we ordered with no food, we got attitude with the staff cussing at us and not comping us food. Never have I ever been somewhere this horrible! Highly not recommended!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! I come here on Thursday's for the wing special.  Took about 10 minutes before someone came over to ask what we wanted to drink.  Then an additional 10 just place our order.  2 people came in while we were waiting to order and they were helped within 5 minutes.  The wings were super dry but service today was the worst ever!   I doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Is it the best sandwich on Phoenix? No. Is it the best value? Quite possibly. 

Cathy is the manager who I have seen in there almost every single time. After a couple visits with slow service (as mentioned in other reviews), We ended up with Cathy as our server. She took our orders quick and was on top of refills and the check. She made sure to give us her name and encourage us to request her in the future. 

We learned are lesson with several of the other servers, but Cathy makes is feel like we're the most important regulars she has. 

Awesome food specials on Wednesday and Thursday ($5 burgers and side and then $.50 hot wings). Great happy hour pricing as well. 

Again, not the fanciest place and it's not 5 star food. But if you want good food for a great value with awesome service, swing by Steve's and ask for Cathy. Tell her Taylor sent you."}
{"text":"-Buffulo burger - eh...nothing special to look at here
-shoestring fries

-men's bathroom stall lock does not work. i walked in on someone accidentally. MENTAL SCAR
-waiter asked if i was going to the rodeo. and people at the bar were legitimately excited about nascar. is this what arizona's like?
-he was kind of annoying too
-never got a refill of water. service was gone when needed. SUPER slow arrival of food, though to be fair Arizona in general seems slow

-felt a bit pricey for what it was
-walking distance from hyatt/convention center

Overall, the food was pretty freaking meh. But it was food. The service was even more MEH. But oh well, fellow traveling businessmen, just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decent place in downtown Phoenix to grab an outdoor lunch when it's not too hot. Big outdoor seating under their awning. Good selection of sandwiches and salads, but food was average. Salads were $8.50-9.00 each but came in reasonably large portions.

Bottom line: Will hit the spot but don't expect to be wowed. Nice option for outdoor lunch and/or drinks."}
{"text":":: DON'T GO HERE ::

It simply isn't worth it, and I am not just talking about the food.

The food is \"meh\" at best - nothing special at all.  

We tried it for breakfast and we had the ham and cheese omelet and the kids french toast.  

Wasn't horrible, but wasn't great either.

Why the 1 star?

Because they don't validate parking.

Which means when your total breakfast tab is less than 20 bucks, you are going to pay 12 bucks for parking unless you are lucky enough to get a spot with a meter right in front of the restaurant.

Oh, and there are no signs that tell you they don't valiate parking - you just get to learn it the hard way.

Or read this - and simply skip this place.

Trust me, you aren't missing anything - there are plenty of other great places within a 5 block radius to go to breakfast."}
{"text":"Um.  

Happy hour specials on the board.  Fine enough.  I was attending a conference across the street so it went without saying we'd try this joint.  I first ask if I can charge my phone somewhere.  Lazy asshole douchecanoe bartender lazily waves in the direction and says \"Power strip over there.\"  Over where?  I figure it out but guess what.  NO POWER SOURCE.  I know this is first world problems but seriously WHAT THE FUCK PHOENIX NOTHING FUCKING WORKS IN THIS CITY.

So I order the $4 margarita.  It was ok, nothing special. They also seem to have some kind of happy hour food special, like free apps by the non-functioning power strips. 

They have two TVs in the joint.  Mind you, this place is like 3 feet from Chase Field and US Airways Arena where the Dbacks and Suns play, respectively.  You'd think they would invest in a package to get out of market games.  Nope.  Now, if you want like local softball teams from Joe's beer league, knock yourself out, but I asked about MLB and they were like \"no.\"  Not even an explanation.  Well fuck you too.

Between the attitude from the bartender (he was such an asshole), the owners (I presume they were the owners) know-it-all righteousness, the bitchy waitresses, well fuck this place in the ass.  I give them an extra star because the margarita wasn't bad.  Oh and the bathrooms were clean and they at least had toilet paper.  Trust me, in Phoenix you can't leave things to chance."}
{"text":"Bad food, service and very bad attitude from the manager.who chewed me out when we complained.  They could not find a desert menu, sat at table for 30 minutes before we got food menus, convention n sports people beware.  This is the ultimate riip off tourist trap."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, and great happy hour drink specials- the best around that I've found so far! Food is mediocre and what you would expect for bar food. I ordered Italian cheese stix and Cajun onion rings that were supposed to come with ranch and remoulade and Cajun spices. The cheese stix were mozzarella sticks (I guess I was expecting cheesy breadsticks or something) and there were 4 in the order (fine for us- we just wanted something small) and the onion rings were unseasoned and only came with ranch (we were really looking forward to the Cajun theme). They have good food specials, too, and seemed really excited for us to have come in, which was nice!"}
{"text":"Great location, best food I had in like for ever. After the auto show, we went in there got a kids meal, veggie burger, crab cake and a quesadilla. Loads of fresh veggies on the Quesadilla. Crab cake was amazingly good. The kids pasta had the best sauce on it and it was made just perfect. The rolls and the burger bun were so good.

Yes the waitress was borderline rude but did her Job very quickly and efficiently. She was working on a thanksgiving day won't blame her if she was in foul mood in an understaffed place. Glad to find a great place in downtown Phx. Three entries and a kids meal came out to 37 + tax so very reasonable as well for the location."}
{"text":"Stopped in because the sign said \"drink specials! $3 margaritas\" didn't get service, had to ask someone for a server, it was completely dead so it should not have taken that long. When we got the four margaritas and one sandwich that was ordered it had already been twenty minutes. Besides the wait for the order the margarita tasted like luke warm salt water... we aren't people to send people to send drinks back but these were too terrible to try and finish. Once we said something they rushed out and erased the margaritas off the menu, the waiter was the most awkward experience, and I would never recommend this place to someone as I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is not bad at all..... when you do finally receive it! It was quite tasty, except no longer hot and barely warm. It had been sitting. But so had we. The servers were nice, when you could catch one. It was pretty crazy howwwww slowwwwwww the service was! And the patio was pretty much empty! So, if you have time to kill, check it out! But brace yourself for the service."}
{"text":"Starting with parking, there is lots of shade but mostly metered. The bar is very colorful and full of life. The food is fantastic, I must for local eats and sports games. Something for everyone to watch across they're 7 tvs. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My experience here was just average. Our server was fun, but the food was nothing to write home about. We were also always chasing the server for utensils and water refills. It was a very busy night, but it was a Saturday in a convention city.  Should be used to the crowd."}
{"text":"Steve's Grillhouse was A-OK!

After a long, hot trip from California I finally made it into Phoenix. While cruising the downtown area, Steve's was one of the first places I saw- so i decided to check it out. 

I ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich while my Girlfriend ordered the Cajun Pasta with Chicken. The wait staff was nice and the food came out quick. I enjoyed my blackened chicken, however the chicken wasn't really 'blackened'- it was just kinda grilled lol. I didn't mind though- the honey mustard tasted good. The Cajun pasta, however, was a little too spicy for my flavor. I know it's 'Cajun' style, but it left such a hot aftertaste in my mouth that it felt a bit much. 

I can see Steve's being a cool little spot to grab a burger from every now and then if i was from the PHX area. Right around the corner from the stadium and arena- got nice outdoor seating that's kept cool by overhead sprinklers- I give it a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was such poor service and the food was below par. It took over an hour for the food to come out and the staff were very unprofessional. The manger for the evening replied with whatever when I asked what was taking our food so long."}
{"text":"First time here with friends during Phoenix Comic Con. The waitress called me a sir, (I'm a female) my boyfriend got his wings cold, it took 15 minutes to get our waters, and I paid $8 for the smallest ceasear salad with no sides or anything. They restaurant wasn't busy as well, I can see why there are so many bad reviews here. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Steve's decor is ridiculous and I love it. It reminds me of Saved by the Bell in an awfully wonderful way. 
They have a very interesting menu, it seems pretty standard diner fare but it is obvious that they provide fresh, healthy options whenever possible. 

My friend and I went for lunch yesterday and we both had burgers. I had a bacon cheeseburger subbed with bleu cheese, my friend had an ostrich burger. I liked hers, l you could tell it is a leaner meat, but it was a little too birdy for me; I will stick to my moo burger.  I ordered my burger medium and it was done exactly so. Both were served on wheat buns. I also had the \"Famous\" tortilla soup which was very good with wonton chips on top, and also tried my dining partner's white chili which was made with chicken.

The service was very friendly and efficient even during the downtown lunch rush. The bathrooms are cute but tiny, and you enter through the kitchen. This isn't a place I will crave, but definitely somewhere I'd stop by again for a nice outdoor lunch (except they allow smoking on the patio..ick. is that even legal? Definitely not 25 feet from the door...)"}
{"text":"Awful service, concept, and food. This restaurant is not appropriate for any occasion. Go to The Kettle Black or Majerle's instead."}
{"text":"First Kathy was our server and extremely efficient. She put up with my coworker who kept changing her mind. LoL Even I got annoyed but she kept her cool.

Thursday was 50 cent wings. So I got six honey hot. It was nice and saucy and delicious! The skin is nice and crunchy and big pieces. My coworkers got the hot, they didn't come with sauce like I'm used to and all of them were served with blue cheese. Want ranch? You have to ask for it.

I got the Fish & Chips with house salad. Sorry about the picture, by the time I remember to take one I had already dug in! LoL Okay, the whole meal was huge and I pushed food on my coworkers and still had to waste some of it. The house salad is a big serving. A huge helping of shoe string fries that I piled on a plate and handed over to my coworkers, the few I had were tasty. The fish are bigger than my hand and I was given 2 pieces. It was good with the tarter sauce that wasn't JUST tarter sauce, it had some kind of orange tint to it. Hot sauce? But it was delicious and I could only eat one.

The fruity tea I got was delicious, freshly brewed - ask for extra ice.

My coworker got the soup of the day, cream of potato bacon. It had huge chunks and my coworker said it was delicious. Two coworkers got the BLT half sandwhich and it came with heaping pile of bacon that looked extra crispy and something I would get next time.

We all said next time we're downtown, we'll be stopping here."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. The server finally came over after we asked 2 people for our server. After that she took our order on a newspaper that she grabbed off a stand because she didnt have her pad. She took out orders and the wrong food came out. Food was bland with little flavor. I do not recomment this place."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow and the food wasn't very good. I ordered the fish and chips expecting a typical fish and chips experience. When I learned that it was actually tilapia, I was curious at first when when I tasted the overcooked, too-thick batter over the crumbly fish I was immediately turned off.

They do make some good flavored lemonades, but really I was just horribly disappointed."}
{"text":"We experienced three cool firsts a couple nights ago at Steve's Grill in the heart of downtown Phoenix.

The first first was the ostrich burger.  Amazingly good!  What did it taste like?  You already know what I am going to say.  It tastes like chicken!  It really does!  Prepared very well (served as ground meat) -  juicy with tomato slices and plenty of diced onion.   

The coleslaw that came with the ostrich burger was okay, but lacked pizzaz.

The second first was Citronage orange liquor.  Normally, I have a splash of Cointreau in my martini, but Steve's didn't have Cointreau.   At first I thought I would just use Triple Sec as my splash.  

But our waitress kept saying, you gotta try the Citronage.  So we finally gave in.  Really distinctive and pleasant flavor.  It's definitely orange but also has a smoky flavor, reminiscent of a good añejo tequila.    

The third first was our waitress, Teigh.  She was fun, and as refereshingly frank,  a server as I have ever had.   After I told her how much I liked the Citronage, she meant it all in good humor when she said \"You bitches were just ganging up on me about insisting on the Triple Sec.  I was trying to tell you about the Citronage!\"

It was nice to get a hot meal after 11:00 at night too.

Oh, and love the huge 44 oz glasses of ice water that you automatically get with your meal."}
{"text":"Nice little grill. Got a late dinner, crab cakes. Had heaters on patio and music playing. Nice atmosphere. Was told by locals that it is a great breakfast place. Maybe tomorrow am!"}
{"text":"After 15 minutes, someone finally greeted us and took our order. After 15 more minutes, we still didn't have our drinks and didn't see our server anywhere. We left. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Thank you, so much, for ruining my Phoenix Comicon this year. NEVER AGAIN will I EVER go to this place again.

Walk in and the place is packed - much to be expected during Phoenix Comicon. Menu selection wasn't the best, but I ordered anyway because I was hungry and my boyfriend picked the place. Took a while to get our food - understandable due to Phoenix Comicon. When we get our food, DISGUSTING. 

I have never, in my 23 years of life, had to salt  burger I've ordered from a restaurant. I ordered a medium burger, got something that was thrown on the grill for 10 seconds on each side. I ate it thinking it was just me being picky but it really was undercooked and gross. The Jalapeños were the only thing keeping me eating the damn burger, and throwing salt and their salsa on it. Fries were just a hard pile of grease.

While we were trying our best to eat this stuff, I notice the wait staff hanging in their corner all at the exact same time, not tending to any tables. I let the eating food in the corner slide because I figured they had been busting their asses all day busy with convention goers, but they just stood their chattering for about 10 minutes when they could be wiping tables or clearing tables or whatever. They were just plain lazy, all except for the guy with the camo avengers shirt and the dish bucket.

Our table was so full and cluttered with useless crap that didn't need to be there. There was barely enough space for our food on the table.

They didn't ask us whether we wanted a booth or table. The regular tables were uncomfortable, YET I was in a seat that faced an empty booth that looked much more comfortable. Would've been nice to know my options.

Huge group of kids show up and they're screaming their heads off all hyper and stuff. Which I understand, BUT do you seriously have to yell, \"WHO WANTS BURGERS? WHO WANTS SPAGHETTI?, Just ask the kids individually and treat them like a normal person. This isn't a damn school field trip and it was very annoying for everyone else in the restaurant, not just me.

After we tried to digest the meal we just had, I wanted to be far away from that place as possible. Get to our hotel room and, just my luck, FOOD POSIONING. So, thank you, so much, for ruining my Phoenix Comicon experience AND my Friday night. Whatever tip my boyfriend gave the waitress was NOT well deserved at all, and I don't say that often (or ever)."}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders and cheap drinks. Seemed like a dive-oasis in an over classed and overpriced desert. Wifi is free and good for simple internet but bandwidth limits didn't let me watch my Dallas Stars game. Would come back!"}
{"text":"The reviews weren't that great but the food was good and they accomidated my kids and I.  It was such a lovely night in PHX.  They even had a nice man playing guitar outside of the patio and my kids really enjoyed him.  I eneded up order the turkey Panini it did't look a panini at all just a turkey sub with some toasted bread, I would have like it if it were grilled better.  But my kids enjoyed thier food and the night so it was win for all!"}
{"text":"Go there for the convenience only.   Food is poor, service is barely better."}
{"text":"You service sucks. I literally watched your manager and employees discuss their schedules and who was closing.. While I waited for a drink that nobody served at your bar that nobody was behind. I hope Steve and Mike figure out who's working today #SUCK"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible service. Only good things were the TV's and the musician out front. Don't stop, keep walking."}
{"text":"I have no clue why the other reviews are so bad. I went here on a double date on a Friday night and everything went well. Amazing food, good service, and we were even able to watch a couple games on the TVs they had. The chipotle Mac and cheddar was outstanding. You can't really go wrong with the food here."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite and a drink just before my flight back home.  Seemed like an ordinary American sports-bar type of restaurant.  It was nice out so we sat out on the patio area. 

I ordered the Famous Tortilla Soup and a Salad  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/steves-greenhouse-grill-phoenix?select=9SyetYbV84cEYwlIejZgSQ#CwViykSXMSxRuhxAy9G0jQ).  I don't know why the tortilla is called \"famous.\"  It was just an ordinary tortilla soup (kind of watery and lacking in chicken flavor)-- nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad.  The salad was pretty plain: chopped iceberg lettuce.  I also ordered a margarita-- this tasted like it had a little too much margarita mix in it but it did the trick :P"}
{"text":"This place is not very good. I wish I would have checked Yelp before eating here. I ordered the white chicken chili, it was awful. Not only was it cold, but it tasted like watered down refined beans with a couple of chunks of processed slimy chicken chunks. It was 99% beans and was otherwise flavorless. My husband had the chicken BLT and the chicken was dry and small and the flavor was bland. The service was friendly but a little harried. Our server seemed a little scatterbrained and the other server I saw looked like he hadn't slept in weeks."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon & went to check out Steve's Greenhouse Grill. I got there at the start of the busy lunch hour. I was seated and Frank promptly took my drink order. He brought the soda right back to the table then let me review the menu. 

There are many selections from sandwiches, salads, pastas and lunch plates. I had the salmon which I ordered blackened. It came with soup, fries & vegetables. Everything was well-prepared and very tasty.

I was impressed with the service. Frank as well as other servers refilled my drink twice. There was a slight delay after my meal before asking if I wanted the check or dessert, but overall I was impressed at how attentive the staff was with a full patio for lunch.

I will return to try other menu items. The prices were reasonable and the quality was good."}
{"text":"As a group of 3, we were steered into Steves via reviews from another site.  The 3 in my part had very diverse orders, being tilapia, a buget and a quesadiilla, all having one thing in common. ...they we all absolutely terrible.  Overcooked and undersized burger, drenched in butter and bland tilapia and boring quesadiilla.   The service was terrible and unintelligent.   Do not eat here.  The only redeeming quality for this establishment was location."}
{"text":"This was a great place to have a reasonably priced meal. We enjoyed good food and great friendly service. The patio was great too. I loved the turkey wrap and very crispy tater tots!"}
{"text":"Very basic stuff but they have survived in an ever changing downtown.  Good specials, especially Wednesday night $5 burgers but essentially high grade bar food."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday for breakfast and although the food was good and hot, they obviously weren't prepared for a crowd.  I initially sat at the bar since there was no one outside to seat me, and the bartender didn't even acknowledge the fact I was there, busy cleaning or something.  He wasn't fixing drinks.  So I got up and stopped one of the servers and asked her if someone could seat me, give me a menu or something, and she went to find a hostess.  She came back and said they ignored her so she proceeded  to seat me in her section, which I was thankful for, since I was able to finally order.  They claimed to be serving brunch all day but didn't have a brunch menu, and when I tried to order a blt they wouldn't even let me order one without the egg, as if it would be too much trouble.  Their 2.5 stars are well-earned!"}
{"text":"Terrible service had to call waiter for our order . Got the calamari came incomplete with 1 sauce not 2 like it said in the menu. Then the waiter  (20 minutes later) Ignored me when just one foot away from me when i complained about it Did not take our order so we called him again as if we had to chase after him to give out our order. Still Gave the meal incomplete. Then had to chase after him to pay our meal. Food was good but service was really freaking bad"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. I have come here twice and enjoy sitting on the patio and listening to live music."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the Alfredo was the service. The salad was good. Worst server ever"}
{"text":"Go for the food, not the service.
My friend and I were looking for a pretty cheap place to eat downtown in between some meetings. We had a few hours to kill and didn't want to grab anything quick (like jimmy johns or chick fil e) just something affordable. We found this spot and decided to check it out.

When we first got there the hostess asked if we wanted to sit in or outside. Not really sure ourselves we talked for maybe just ten seconds and then she made the decision for us. No one else was waiting in line ..   Luckily it turned out ok to sit outside, but I was not a fan of her abruptness. 

From there it took about 15 minutes for our server to get to us. Luckily another one who was working outside and grabbed us some drinks. I was surprised that we got our food in a timely fashion and that it was still hot.

I ordered a turkey burger and my friend had a regular burger. I fell in love with the food. It was just the kind of bar food I was expecting too. Big and greasy. So my cravings where definitely satisfied as where my friend's.

The disappointment with service continued though. Our server offered us condiments to dress our burgers when she dropped them off, but we never saw her until we were basically done our meal. So of course we grabbed some ketchup from an abandoned table. She first took my plate since my friend was still working but then didn't show up again until 12 minutes later with the check. Never asking us if we wanted drink refills or anything else to eat. Then another 8 minutes to grab the bill and another 6 to check us out. 

Mind you it was well staffed and not very busy, yet we were there for 1.5 hours instead of a comfortable 40 minute meal."}
{"text":"Nice covered patio, very small bar inside. Decent beer selection.

We came here for a pre ballet drink on Sun. The service at their tiny bar was good, cant speak for the food as we didnt eat. Seemed like a relaxing little spot in the middle of the city."}
{"text":"i would sooner die before eating here again. im not one to write a bad review but im hoping this saves people their time and money. we sat outside with a party of 11, and were delivered water pretty quickly and were told our server would be there shortly. it was not shortly. about 15 minutes later our server arrived and took our drink and food order. despite saying brunch served all day neither breakfast or lunch is served all day; so we had to get breakfast food. our drinks which took an upwards of another 15 mins arrived. coffee luke warm at best and despite ordering a strawberry lemonade we were told there were no strawberries. our food arrived a few minutes later. well most of the food. 2 people in our party waited over 15 mins after the first set of food came out to get theirs. at this point we had already gone inside and spoken with mutiple different people at least 4 times. finally we all started eating. its pretty hard to mess up breakfast food but this place figured it out! the omelet was seriously horrible and the potatoes were disgusting. but dont worry we got a strawberry sauce deivered to the table that no one ordered. it was probably the strawberries they didnt have for the lemonade. we never got a refill had to go inside 2 more times to get the check and to get it corrected. it was a horrible horrible horrible experience. please save your time and money and dont eat here."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.

My guy has wanted to try Steve's the last few times we've been to Phoenix and stayed at the Hyatt across the street but we've never managed to work it in. Tonight we did after a Diamondbacks game. I'm very glad we did. 

We just ordered burgers but they were the best we've had in a long time. I'm one of those weirdos that likes my burger medium or medium rare and even places that let me pick how I want it cooked always bring it to me well done. I never send it back but just eat my dry overcooked tasteless burger. I didn't have to do that here though. The meat was perfect. I ordered the cowboy burger minus the BBQ sauce. ($8.50) The patty was good sized and came topped with a thick slice of tomato, a good portion of Romain lettuce and a thick slice of red onion lots of bacon, cheese and onion straws. I chose the grilled potatoes as my side. They turned out to be sliced red potatoes grilled with some green chili's. Yummy. My BF chose the French fries. They were good also. Shoestring style. Crispy with almost a battered texture. We chose to sit on the patio where a they had a guitarist playing. Entertaining with out being overbearing. My bf even tipped him when we left (something he rarely does). 

All in all a really good experience. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. The only thing that kept it from being prefect was the Cole slaw was bland and although the waitress was efficient she just didn't have much of a personality. But now I'm just splitting hairs. It was a great casual dinner"}
{"text":"A-OK describes Steve's Greenhouse Grill perfectly in my opinion. It's somewhat like a Cracker Barrel minus the company backing and plus sports... a rather kitsch design scheme with loud colors, loud TVs, and loud alcohol advertisements hung all around, a large and  eclectic menu with something that will surely please all types of eaters, your very typical bar menu of slightly overpriced drinks, and somewhat over the top servers singing praise over every single menu item (\"You can't go wrong!\" \"They're all my favorite!\"). I had some chicken fried steak with fries and Kristen G. had \"The Special\", which was fish and chips with a bowl of New England clam chowder. Everything was A-OK. Some things were a little salty, some things were just right, some too bland... I'm telling you, if you took a Cracker Barrel, cut the budget by three quarters, and told the manager to attempt to please every kind of patron that would be walking around this area of Phoenix, you would get Steve's Greenhouse Grill."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered the patty melt and fries for lunch. Food arrived in less than 10 minutes, so I have no idea why fries weren't piping hot and instead, barely warm. Patty melt cheese wasn't melted. Pretty bland sandwich. Served with 1000 island dressing (no, it wasn't a reuban ).  Generous wine pour though. Sat on patio around 12:30. Crowd was light."}
{"text":"Customer service sucked at the bar.   Employees didn't seem happy at all.  Heard them bitching and complaining by the computer.  Over this place. I'll go back to Marjorie's where the staff seemed happy to see everyone and excited they were getting business"}
{"text":"This bar is in a good location if you're in the downtown stadium district but ... I ordered two car bombs and rather than bring them to me, the server came back and informed me how much they would be. Okay, so go get them. Then he comes back with a can of Guinness and one shot. He sets down two glasses and looks at me and says \"oh, did you want a shot too?\" Then he brings me my check and the car bombs are not on it. I had to remind him to go back and add them to my tab because I was leaving... immediately."}
{"text":"Have been here several times in the past year or two. Food is standard bar fare and service for us has been good. This particular visit I had the Chile Burger with poblano chilies. Was just OK, bland. Wifey had the Caesar Salad and says is was good. Location is convenient, otherwise I'd never come here."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst menu I have ever seen. Horrible elevator music, distasteful attempt at decoration and my bread was as hard as a Rock. Cesar salad was drenched I'm dressing and my lettuce was soggy."}
{"text":"I went here twice over a few days while I was staying at the Hyatt next door. The first night had slow service but the burgers were good. So were the margaritas. A few nights later, the service was appalling. And I mean as bad as I have ever seen anywhere. We got seated right away but waited for 10 minutes before getting our drink order in. Then it was another 15 minutes for our thrown together margaritas with no salt or lime to arrive. And another half hour for two burgers to arrive. There were people walking up on the street waiting to get seated but after 10 minutes of nobody greeting them, they eventually walked away. Others got seated, waited and waited while nobody came to greet them and walked out without any wait staff knowing they were there. Others could not wait any longer to get seated so just walked in, found a table, sat down and were ignored. No idea where the manager was. I was in no rush and watching the horrific service play out in front of me was entertaining enough to stay. Right after our food arrived I ordered another drink which by the time we finished eating and it had not arrived yet, I told the kid waiting on us to forget it. No margarita is worth another 20 minutes of waiting. He looked surprised I was upset. He may have looked more surprised at the comical tip I left him. No excuse for such terrible service at such a premium location right downtown. No idea how this place stays open if this is normal for them. I can't say service is like this all the time but be warned if you go here. Give yourself plenty of time and prepare to be patient."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service is just awful. Sat at the table for 40 minutes, server finally brought my drink after the food arrived. I order 4 street tacos, they were cold, but still mostly tasty. I work 20 seconds from here, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon and tried it out tonight.  It was completely dead so I didn't have any issues with service like many other people noted.  Our waiter was awesome and very attentive.  Burgers were juicy and flavorful but perhaps a bit too much seasoning... still very good though.  Their red skin potatoes were super awesome and a nice alternative to fries.  Really good ranch too!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, waiter was so nice and attentive and funny! The food was so good, I had a Patty Melt that was so tasty and not greasy at all!  MY husband had the Crab Cake sandwich and he really enjoyed it!   Dessert was AWESOME!!!  It was a Turtle Brownie the biggest one we had ever seen!  It was a very nice way to end a perfect day of ballet and dinner!"}
{"text":"So, the breakfast was huge. That's possibly the good thing to say about it. Service was not particularly helpful, food took a long time to come, and quality was hit and miss.

Not going back, nope."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, ended up leaving and going somewhere else. We won't be back. Can't comment on the food quality as we didn't get the chance to order anything."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a show on our way to the Hyatt Regency. They close at 11 pm and we ordered at 10:15 pm. We were not welcomed but, again, it was the end of the night and the busser was cleaning the tables and finishing up. The girl who waited on us was friendly and helped us choose food off the menu. (The menu is not particularly cohesive in its choices. No real theme.) We decided on the California Burger and added mushrooms. We are not \"fries\" people so we ordered the red potatoes. The food came out fairly quickly but we had to scrounge for silverware and a napkin to no avail until she returned to a different table and we called out. The raspberry lemonade and food was really good. I considered going back in the morning for some bacon, eggs and more potatoes, but maybe next time. (We checked out of the Hyatt early cause the fire alarm went off on the 21st floor and stopped all the elevators. We decided to just get out of Dodge.) We didn't go inside so not sure how clean the bathrooms are but the outdoor patio was clean enough and the food was good. I'd go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Decided to try Steve's before a D-back's game as other places were packed (AZ Rattlers we playing a championship game that night as well). We were seated quickly, got water and our drink order. My wife ordered the Turkey Melt w/fries and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger w/onion rings for $2 extra. The food was quite good and satisfying. 
Our waitress was quite a character, but very friendly in her own unique way. It's not a bad place to go before a game, I'd go back."}
{"text":"They forgot what I ordered, my omelette was dry, and the waiter never came back to refill my drink our give me my check still waiting for my waiter nowhere in sight service is extremely slow and sucks"}
{"text":"We visited this location during the Urban Wine Walk and then continued on but I totally want to go back and check it out again. It had a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"OK, so only 1 reviewer before me, and they had and liked the Ostrich burger, so I tried it too. I must say, I didn't think it tasted anything like chicken, I thought it was very lean and A LOT like Buffalo. It was good, very good for me. Horrible for the ostrich - I'm certain. 

My wife had a turkey deal. Some kind of sandwich. She liked it very well, as well. 

My only \"beef\" was my waitress brought me a bottle of ketchup with no ketchup and a big poop for me is having my diet coke run dry. And it ran dry folks! I almost went through the roof, but instead, I just waited and asked for a refill. Bam! 

Real good food, glad I went. Used my Yelp Mobile App for my iPhone to find the join. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back, but the service staff never gets better.  This time was with my wife, when we'd treated ourselves to a night at the Hyatt across the street.  After dropping plenty there on drinks and appetizers, we moved to Steve's.  Thinking we'd have more fun and save a couple bucks on drinks.

The bar waitress was terrible.  I'm fine with the lip ring and tattoo and whatnot...if you're profesional and personable.  She was terribly put-out that we existed, and ordering each round was a painful exercise in prying her away from either the TV or her friends in the wait staff.

This has been the fourth time I've tried this place in a couple years.  Sometimes, you can just tell the owner has checked out."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a half a star or zero I would. It was awful. We walked down to the grill after visiting the Museum. There were 9 of us and the place looked like it would be able to fit us. Looked empty inside. We were hungry so asked the guy standing outside if he room. He said \"hold on let me check. This might be your lucky day\" while looking at his empty dining room. Then starts telling other people who are waiting on a table that they were running out of food. When they questioned him on what he does have his response \"what do you mean. We have a full menu\" but you just said you were out of food. \"No. I said we were out of fish\" then the host continues to argue with the other guests. We decide to leave and he gets upset with us saying that if we stay he would give all of our drinks free."}
{"text":"I AM A FAN.... of this funky little downtown dining spot. I don't really understand the theme, or maybe there isn't one at all... it's just cool! Nice patio for outside dining, which is what my wife and I opted for last week on a perfect spring evening. Our server was quick to take our orders (it was a pretty slow night, but hey, it was a Monday), and was very attentive to us our entire visit. The food was decent enough. I had the Chile Burger and my Wife had the Ostrich burger (which I actually thought was overpriced.... $12.95 for a 6oz patty... hmmmm). The fries and the potatoes that came on the side were really good though! 

From what my friends have told me, this is one of the best happy hour spots (price wise) in downtown Phoenix! We were there after happy hour and the drink prices were still pretty cheap! I'm definitely planning on dining/drinking here again!

Lastly, I gotta give a shout out to Vinny! The dude is probably one of the nicest, most genuine people out there! Anyone would be lucky to have him as your server at Steve's!!"}
{"text":"We stopped into this restaurant after work because we were looking for dinner, and most of the other restaurants in the area were packed due to an Imagine Dragons concert happening nearby. It was a little suspicious since all other restaurants were crammed and there was barely anyone here, but I was getting hangry so we decided to stop in. 

There was live music and we ate outside, which wasn't terrible. The menu was a bit confusing - you could get a burger or pizza which is expected for a grill, but they also had a few surprising items like chicken biryani that sprinkled the menu. I was craving pizza so that's what I ordered while my coworkers ordered burgers. 

We also got the appetizer sampler, which was pretty good but it's hard to mess up fried food. When my pizza came, after one look I was no longer hungry. I ate about two slices and was done - it tasted maybe like a lunchables pizza that was microwaved. My coworker that ordered a cheeseburger didn't finish, and commented that it was one of few times he didn't finish a burger. 

Pretty meh. Only come here if you're starving."}
{"text":"Horrible food & service!   Don't waste your time or money on this place!  I ate here last Saturday with some friends and it was one of the worst dining experience I have ever had.  We arrived and were asked for our order after about 5 minutes. Not bad but it got much worse from the on.   After another 15 minutes drinks were finally delivered. The problem was we ordered vodka tonics and received vodka and cranberry juice.  We stated that was not out order and they took them back to get the correct drinks.  15 minutes later still no drinks.  We are at a total of about 35 minutes now waiting on drinks.  My friend finally walked to the bar to see about the drinks.  The bar tender was extremely rude saying oh you mean the vodka cranberry drinks I made.  She explained that wasn't what we ordered and he decided to make the correct drinks.  Now that we finally got drinks another 20 minutes passed and we still don't have food. Mind you the table behind us placed there order after we did and they have received there food and are finished by this time.   We have been there almost a hour by now.  I complained to the waiter letting him know we needed to be at a concert said he could just bring us our check for the drinks.  Totally shocked I said you are really charging is for drinks that we waited 35 minutes for and had to get ourselves.  He said he would send a manager over.  Manager was useless, just didn't want us to leave on our food order.  Surprisingly food arrives soon after the manager walked over - we order flatbread that was cold and tasteless.  It was awful!   We asked for the bill and we were being charged for everything.  No attempt at making up for their horrible service at all.   The manager finally took 1 drink off the bill - very big of him!   I guess when your restaurant is this bad you are used to people complaining.  I would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Convenient location to where we were, but the service was VERY slow and inattentive. Food was \"meh\" overall and had to return a very wilted salad; the outdoor seating area was not very clean."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars, I honestly would. We were seated right away, however no one came to our table for at least 10 minutes, which is insane because there weren't many people to begin with. Three different waiters told us someone would be with us \"shortly.\" They received a large to go order and decided to work on that instead of ours. We were there for over an hour when we finally found out they hadn't even STARTED our meal. They knew we were leaving and didn't even bother to apologize or anything. Not to mention, they actually messed up the to go order as well. Save yourselves some time and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today at Steve's with 2 friends. We were greeted and seated very quickly inside. Our waitress who I believe was one of the managers, came over and took our drink orders. I had the strawberry lemonade which was phenomenal!  I had the tuna melt, my friend had the California burger, and my another friend had the chicken and chips. The food was delicious amongst all of us. I also used a Groupon and had absolutely no issues with it. The food the service and everything was excellent. We will definitely be back again to try the specials."}
{"text":"Steve's is hit or miss with the service. Just know that going in. Vinny is great. The others... Meh. The kitchen takes for-ev-er. (Squints from The Sandlot style right there) I've gone times where we were the only table in the whole joint and it still takes for-ev-er.... And then the burgers were over cooked. Blegh. Whatever.  

I do like the burgers from here. When they are cooked med rare like I likes 'em. Cowboy burger... drool. Actually all the food I've had here has been pretty tasty. The beer selection is pretty good and the vibe is kickin. They usually have live jams on the patio on the weekends."}
{"text":"This woman that owns this business is having friends write good reviews for her, she is mean and nasty to her customers and the food is so-so from my experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner because it was very close to our hotel and we were able to be seated immediately. They have outdoor seating, which we chose since it was a nice evening. The seating its self was lacking. The staff was nice but not on top of their game. They did not come around often enough and made some errors.

I was feeling like something simple so I ordered the Breakfast Burro. It comes stuffed with scrambled eggs, green chiles, potatoes and cheddar cheese. I chose to add sausage. It was good sized, enough to fill me up. The flavor was a touch bland, but I was able to overcome that with some hot sauce.

This is not a bad place. If you are looking for affordable bar food, then it probably will be ok."}
{"text":"Too bad there is jot an option for negative stars, or rather a falling star.  Steve's earned it today.  Lots of us having lunch together.  The results was the same....... Lunch sucked.  White chicken and bean chicken sorely lacked chicken.  Chicken was fresh from the deep freezer, lacking taste and texture. The bison burger was again a freezer bound burger, but took enough time to cook it , that it seemed as though they slit the animals throat themselves.  The fish tacos lacked zest.  But the beer was wet.   The Long wait did not make this meal taste any better in anticipation, but reinforced that we were glad we got this place out of the way..... Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Took a while for a server to show up.  Food arrived and no ketchup for the fries.  Had to wait forever for the server to come back.  Sandwich didn't have all the ingredients described on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try new restaurants via whatever comes up thru Groupon. We've tried some ok and some forgettable places. But OMG Steve's Grillhouse was a total surprise. We LOVED it. Will go back again with no groupon/coupons-yes they were that good.
I got the blacked pork chops. They came with House potatoes, mixed veggies and a roll. 2 pork chops. My husband got the green chili burger. I had never had blacked pork chops- They were the reason for the 5 starts. Total FLAVOR!! I'm so tired of flavorless food or food that I have to cover up with condiments.
The wait staff were very nice and they refilled drinks before they were empty ( I think that's a plus in the AZ heat)
Oh yeah- sports were on the tvs if your in to that...my husband was."}
{"text":"First and last time here. The bartender is extremely rude and when we asked to speak to a manager we were dismissed. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I have made the mistake of eating here 4 times.  Each time had garbage food and garbage service.  I left hungry each time."}
{"text":"Received a Groupon from a friend, so decided to check this place out before it expired. We stood at the hostess stand for 5+ minutes, before finally grabbing one of the very busy waitresses who ended up seating us. She was very nice, but you could tell she was in over her head and they were under staffed. She did the best she could, but it shouldn't take over 30 minutes for your food to arrive, especially during lunch. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about. 

With all of the conventions and nearby hotels, they have the potential to do great things, but from my experience, I don't know that I would ever return."}
{"text":"This was my second visit there.  The first was really bad but thought maybe an off day.. food was ok but the service wasnt very good.  Well I was maybe right.. First visit maybe was an off day because the second visit was even worse.  Rude staff, not busy, couldnt get waited on, the staff were bickering it seemed.  FINALLY got our food--only 3 of us-- and then couldn't get refills or a check.  Done.  Cant even imagine what a third visit would be like."}
{"text":"My buddy and I heard that this was the place to watch English football on the weekends, so we drove twenty minutes out of the way to check it out. 

The sign says that they open at 6:30, but there wasn't a soul there when we arrived at 8:00. 

Stick to your posted hours you twats."}
{"text":"This place was good.  It was a nice location from the Hyatt when we went to Phoenix Comicon this year.  We probably ate here at least twice.  The staff was great, but at times I could tell they wished the comicon crowd wasnt in town..."}
{"text":"Finished watching a ballet performance and thought this place looked like a good spot to have dinner.  Well I was wrong. I got the sampler platter, everything was over cooked and had no taste. I would have to say that Applebee's sampler platter is way better then what I ate. The waiter made me feel rushed and when I asked him a question he just said look at the menu. (Okay but isn't it your job to know the menu.) The bathrooms had a weird smell and were dirty. On my way home I started getting a stomach ache.  Please done waste your hard earned money and eat here."}
{"text":"Fish n chip special was good. Nice range of happy hour discount drinking. Kathy was an excellent server but disappeared after round two. Or was it three?"}
{"text":"Went there twice since it was close to the Convention Center and there was an advertisement for 10% off for convention attendees to the event I attended.

Food was good.  Price was reasonable.

BUT

Service was really slow.  Waited 20 minutes for the bill the 2nd time I ate there.

Refused to honor the convention discount of 10%.  1st time, the waiter forgot to include the discount.  I didn't bother to check until after I left.  2nd time, the waitress said the discount applied only to volunteers at the event.

I mentioned this at the information department of the convention I was attending.  Hope they do something about this.  Either way, without any evidence of attempts to improve their service or honesty, will go elsewhere for breakfast even if it costs me more."}
{"text":"Ok so this place has 300 reviews and 2.5 stars.... my first experience was the day of Sept 2017 Urban Ale Trail and my friend got me a Lemon Jello Shot. I asked the bartender to trade the yellow JellO shot for a red one and bartender said no. Like a quick NO. I was in shock. Like why!? 
Ok there you go. Short, older woman bartender is rude and SHE is the reason you deserve 1 star!"}
{"text":"There are two days a week where Steve's is the best place to have lunch downtown: Tuesdays and Thursdays. $2 Street Tacos on Tuesdays (get the beef ones, they're great!) and 50-cent Wings on Thursdays. The quality of the food is actually pretty good!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a few beers and a snack.  Had a few orders of the street tacos and they were decent especially for the $2 price tag.  Saw one of the waiters give the bartender the middle finger after the bartender convinced a few college girls to sit at the bar instead of being seated at a table - very classy.  Also, had the pleasure of sitting next to an individual who was in need of a bath.  After trying to be nice to this individual since he was starring at us for a few minutes, we said, \"hello\" and we were met with a \"grrrrr\" for a response.  I think the restaurant should have questioned if that was the type of client they are in search for.    

Again, decent food, good prices on beers but management needs to question their decisions"}
{"text":"You can't beat the $5 burger special. Any burger on the menu, plus tots, is only $5. And they're tasty and big."}
{"text":"This hidden place was a very nice surprise. I ate the fish and chips. The fish was crispy and flakey and fresh. The clam chowder was good! And in from New England too lol. 
Cathy at the bar was a great and friendly person. 
Overall I like this place. I'll be back for sure ."}
{"text":"Okay I'm going for 5 stars because this is one of the most reasonably price places I've been to in downtown Phoenix and the food is quite good. Good not great but to be able to get 6 beers and dinner for 2 under $60 with tip it's a keeper. Oh, did I mention live entertainment and this awesome patio where the sun never shines. Most importantly outstanding service even though our waitress was under the weather loosing her voice she was awesome. Nice find and a keeper!"}
{"text":"We had a very poor experience at Steve's. The serving staff and bartender seemed annoyed to have customers and the manager was downright rude. It was a struggle just to order food. Sad because the food was actually pretty good.  We stayed because we had already purchased a Groupon, but we definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Sunday for lunch with a party of 3. It was literally right in front of the Hyatt regency doors where we were staying and so I was like okay cool. I'm a huge carnivore so the fact that I saw the word \"green\" in greenhouse grill, I wasn't so thrilled to try it out coz I knew it would probably be really healthy and quite possibly not have meat options.

We sat down just in time before it got busy. Looking at the menu, prices were $13+ for much more filling foods like the pasta and chicken menu. They come either with soup or salad. I ordered the white chicken chili for my soup and Tuscan chicken breasts. Now, I hate soup but it came with it so I had to pick the wiser choice that came with meat. I am happy to say that I was surprised it was actually really good. Seriously good. My Tuscan chicken breasts that is covered in Parmesan and pesto was good but I felt that the pesto was a little bit strong. The meat wasn't too dry or too juicy. Roasted seasoned potatoes were good and my fruit cup was delicious, absolutely.

The service? Uhh not a huge fan. Sometimes they take forever to come back and check on your table. At one point, our waitress did not come back for a while that I had to go inside the restaurant since we were seated outside, and go ask for a glass of water in the bar and I brought it to my table. Also, just double check your silverware that it's clean. I don't think the waitress realized that she got some of the white chicken chili soup on my glass of water on the rim.

Overall, as a carnivore, this place is a good choice if you're trying to eat a meat healthy option or if you stay at the Hyatt and you have to be close to your hotel for your flight."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid!!! Place looks dirty and unkept. Never got refills...or even asked if we wanted them! We waited forever for our food....long after those that arrived after us received their food! Never once did we see the waiter. Just as we were about to ask for our check to just pay for out one round of drinks and leave he came out with our food....and it was cold! I asked for malt vinegar for my fish....big mistake!! It was expired and sour smelling....even had brown foam on top! Conveniently the part of the label with the expiration date on it was missing. I refused to touch anything else. Twice the waiter walked by...never asked how food was or acknowledged us. When he finally came to see if we were done he asked if I needed a box....told him vinegar was expired...he smelled it...made a face and agreed. I told him to take my food off of the bill....I didn't eat ok. No apology...and nothing...walked away! Came back with our check...said nothing and walked away! Unbelievable! My daughters food and my husbands food was cold and tasted to them like it had been sitting around a long time..I don't doubt it. My daughter tried bathroom...dirty...small and couldn't turn the water on to wash her hands! We will not be back and I sure hope....if you're reading this....you don't try it either. Anything would be better than this dump! Ew!"}
{"text":"Convenient place to get breakfast and lunch.

Ate @ Steve's twice in one day.

Kitchen and servers were great with healthier breakfast substitutions - egg white omelet was delish.

Lunch was so-so, salad was a generous portion. Lunch plates seemed to be big volume - but I would have preferred a smaller portion with fresher & better quality veggies.

My morning waitress and afternoon waiter were both friendly and attentive. Steve's is convenient and flexible for people of all tastes."}
{"text":"The salad was great but there grilled chesse was terrible. The waiter was hardly around to get a refill"}
{"text":"Really good meatloaf soft and flavorful. Topped with chunky tomato sauce. We had the chocolate money. Omg was it good. Crispy egg rolls filled with Ghirardelli chocolate and a ripe banana fried crispy then rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Served with three scoops of vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce. The crackle of crispy egg roll yummy"}
{"text":"We happened to stop in here after checking in at the Hyatt on New Years Eve. They had a great musician playing out on the sidewalk so we took a seat on the patio. Bonus for the hubby that they had a couple of \"smoking tables\". Had a few beers and enjoyed the sidewalk show before heading out for the evening. Nice place to get a quick drink if you are staying at the Hyatt and don't want to pay the hotel prices. Intended to stop in when we got back at the end of the evening but unfortunately they were already closed. I will definitely look them up next time I'm downtown in the area."}
{"text":"Food was decent at best and the service was beyond subpar. I had to pretty much ask for my server to come back after waiting close to ten minutes so I can order and I was maybe one of five or six people there. After he took my order he never came back to check on me and I once again had to ask someone else for my check."}
{"text":"A solid three stars from me. I come to Phoenix every year for a conference, and have been coming here for 6 years now. It is always consistent. While I have always had breakfast, service and food are good. Nothing that really jumps out and says \"I would drive a thousand miles through a gasoline fire to eat here, you have to try this!\", but it beats the highway robbery prices at the hotel. Someday, I will try lunch or dinner and report back."}
{"text":"Love this place it is fantastic. The owner Kathy runs this place very well and if you go on a Fri or Sat night and Blaine Long is playing then you are in for a treat."}
{"text":"This diner was absolutely atrocious. The service was extremely rude and when I attempted to get the waitresses attention she lashed out at me and refused to serve my fiancé and I. I will no longer be going to Steve's greenhouse Grill for breakfast which was a tradition for my fiancé and to go on Sundays because this woman was so rude and treated us this way. The food was cold on multiple occasions. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Rad decor and certainly catches your attention if you're walking on the street. 

At-least that's why we decided to stop by. Our server Lelaine was nice and attentive. I don't blame her for the remainder of my experience. The food along w/ the drinks were just awful. 

The bartender making the alcoholic beverages needs to take a step back and taste his/her own drinks. They were unbearable. With the exception of the mango margarita, the drinks we ordered were better off in the trash. 

The food wasn't any better. One minor inconvenience- had we not read through our entire bill, we would have been charged an extra $10 for a drink we didn't order. 

I think it's always best the server checks the receipt to ensure the bill is correct. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say -  I'm sure there are much better places in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"I been going to this place off and on for years so I like it... however loud annoying soccer fans singing group songs at 9am is super whack. So much so that we left after driving 30 just to eat there..."}
{"text":"Loved it - very fair prices - open for breakfast too- had a salmon sandwich for dinner -$9 and tasty - tired of fancy restaurants and the prices? check it out -they offer inside and outside seating- 1/2 block from convention center and across the street from the Hyatt"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch at 1100 and they seemed a bit unprepared but my server Joshua came through like a champ.  He did a great job of taking care of me and was very friendly.  The Four Peaks Kilt Lifter was quite good as was the Monterey Grilled Chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been here on and off when I'm in town for conventions.  The food is good quality, but the service is kinda wishy/washy.  This morning it took almost 8 minutes for me to be greeted/seated even though the restaurant was about a quarter full.  Another 8-10 minutes for them to take my order.  Satisfying meal, though my BLT was a little scant on the bacon.  Pretty affordable, but if you're in a hurry, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Steve's yesterday and took the boy out for dinner. 

At first I was very impressed. I love living in a city and the patio has that awesome downtown, surrounded by big buildings, busy feel. They had televisions so we could watch the basketball game, and misters so we could stay cool. (Great misting system by the way, not the annoying kind that just soaks everything.) 

I made sure to check up on Yelp to see how my fellow Yelpers felt about this place before stopping by. They only gave the place 3 stars, but all the reviews were pretty positive, so we gave it a whirle. 

Three stars is very accurate. Why?....
the good....
-cute fun ambiance
-nice big menu that can satisfy anyone
-very nice friendly staff
-great looking happy hour
-and there is a Groupon Now for more than 50% off - winning!
the bad....
-lousy service, not horrid, but slow and waitress couldn't be found sometimes
-a tinny bit on the expensive side - happy hour is the time to go!
-food was good, not great but good (specifically, cottage cheese was watered down and the mac'n'cheese had way too much chipotle spice in it)

Over all we had a good time, the people watching is great! There was a convention about to start for some wacko hippy spiritual liberal boarder hopping group. Ha-Lare-E-Os! 

I def recommend them, but try to get the Groupon or check out happy hour, and don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, nothing blew me away here.
Service: OK, correct food came out, but we sat for awhile before anyone came over and drink refills were nonexistent.
Food:ok, They were burgers.  Took awhile. 
Atmosphere:ok.  I guess.  It was a nice night, so we sat on the patio.  Which is sort of cave like.... I like the guy on the sidewalk playing his guitar...
See what I mean? I'm not fully on A-ok... not quite a Meh.... just ok."}

{"text":"First time in Arizona arrived on Friday, March 2nd asked for fettuccine and asked for sundried tomatoes.   Didn't think it would be that difficult to add some sundried tomatoes to some noddles. Well yes no sundried tomatoes.  Than as me and friends are finishing up dinner a waiter accidentally dropped glasses of water on my back. He apologized which I understand accidents happen. But what shocked me was 1) the manager didn't even bother to come out to apologize and if manager wasn't there than the next person in charge should have also come out to apologize. But to my surprise he/she didn't. What a coward. 2) not even some type of discount was given.  Not that I needed it but being offered what would have been a nice gesture after they gave me a shower.  So for that they get 1/2 a star."}

{"text":"Went here last night after my wife's Phoenix Symphony concert with about 12 of her friends.

Food came out very quickly. Ordered a Midori sour and calamari. Calamari was above average and $8.   

Staff was not overly friendly, but also we didn't feel like we were bothing the server either.

Fun/lively atomosphere

Kitchen closed down way too early (10 pm).

Bottom line, it was good, but not a must-visit place"}
{"text":"I went to Steve's as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.

It has a nice atmosphere, and I love the patio.

We were only there for about 30 minutes, but in that time, I was pleased with the level of service we received, and with the chips and salsa.

The chips are kinda different, almost like fried wontons in their texture. They were delicious. And the salsa had a nice flavor, and decent heat.

I was hoping to have breakfast after the crawl, but I was too exhausted (old) and had to head home long before that happened.

I will definitely go back to Steve's, and especially to try their breakfast menu.

(only 3 stars because I didn't get enough time or food experience yet)"}
{"text":"Love the wings love the drink specials hate the service. It is almost impossible to get service in there you have to ask to be served. I come here often and deal with it 99% of the time but today I had had it I came in set for 10 minutes no one said anything then finally someone came and asked had I been help I told them know they told me they would be back 10 minutes later. Someone else walks in sitstwo seats down from me and gets served right away. I brought it to that servers attention and she said she didn't know which was understandable but as a customer coming on lunch it is frustrating the restaurant wasn't even busy it had two semi large parties and a few sprinkled here and there but that's all I've been there on busier days at busier times. Please step your service up so I can continue to be a customer"}

Between us, we had crab cakes(who knew in Phoenix?), burgers, soup, salad, chicken strips, and the most amazing sampler platter I've  ever seen! Every dish was excellent."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger (or a veggie burger) and a beer downtown.  They have the best spicy onion rings, and a great veggie burger.  Of course they have like ten other burgers on the menu, as well as lots of chicken dishes, sandwiches, pasta and salads.

This restaurant has been open since the '70's, and as a result, you'll see many generations of people while you're there.  Great Grandma?  Grandma?  Mom? Dad? Little Susie?  Yep.  They're all there."}
{"text":"Nice Happy Hour spot in downtown Phoenix. Their Sunday brunch is good as well. Kind of a small establishment,. Nice friendly staff."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived in Downtown Phoenix for 4 years and I had never been to this place! I found Steve's after stumbling around Downtown looking for happy hour food after getting back after work. Man, was I impressed. I was excited to discover they have $6 gourmet burgers on Wednesday's. I ordered my bacon Burger medium and they cooked it perfectly. Not only was the food great, but the service was exceptional. They got me in and out of there in 15 minutes with a decent sized croud. What a great alternative to many of these other places that make you wait like an hour to get your food and don't even refill your beverege. Kudos to my waiter, Gordon, for doing a stellar job. I will be back again in a few Wednesday's. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Chill bar atmosphere. Very large menu with lots to choose from. It was our servers first day and she did a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"So. This was just a bad experience from the start. I stood st the podium for a solid 5-8 minutes no one greeted me so I just took a seat. Woman comes over brings me a menu and ask what I want to drink. She comes back with the drink and I ask her what the soup of the day is? She has no clue. So I ask her how much the \"fish and chips\" special is? Again crickets. I was then like okay can I just order a burger then? She then proceeds to tell me she is not a waitress but a hostess and that my waitress will be put in \"a few\". Ooookay. I wait another 5 minutes waitress comes to take order fine. In the mean time I watch not 1 but TWO other people get up and leave because no one is serving them. 20 minutes after waiting for my meal, the waitress sends over a bus boy to ask me what I had ordered  I dumbfoundedly repeat my order and away he goes. 10 more minutes goes by and I ask the hostess when my food will be out? Her reply \"I don't know I'm not the waitress\" and then goes back to her podium. Another 5 minutes go by and the bus boy brings me my food no other stops or refills were made to my table until I GOT UP and went to the counter for my check. Absolutely ridiculous and horrible service. The only reason they got 2 stars was because there food was actually good. I would avoid here if you want fast/friendly/ or knowledge employees"}

{"text":"Came here in October 2008.
Happening place at night with kids singing their songs out near the patio.  Pretty good singer.  Convenient to staying around the convention area.
Staff is friendly.  Ate here for breakfast, 2 eggs for $5.00, toast for $2.00.  Pretty good.  I wanted pineapple and he went hunting for it for me because they usually give cantaloupe.  They have breakfast buffet sometimes also but I havent had that.  The spread looks pretty good though from waffles to sausage to bacon to eggs to potatoes, juices, etc.
Also had dinner here and it was pretty good.  Their speciality house potatoes are YUMMY."}
{"text":"Nope! This place has low stars for a reason. We never got to order because we were asked to leave, so I cannot comment on their food. But the services sucked! Don't waste your time! There are plenty of other places in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"Just left there with NO food as they paid no attention to me telling them I have a severe allergy to tomatoes that will place me in hospital (stop breathing). They served me  my hamburger with guacamole with chopped tomatoes in it. The waiter said that they normally don't have tomato in it ( did not make me feel safe at all). He graciously said he wasn't going to charge me...nice right, wonder if they would of paid for the helicopter ride to the hospital. They did charge the person I was with for her meal-- you would think the manager (who decided to bill her) would of not charged our table since they ruined our meal out. Besides, the food is basic and pre made. Safe your money and go elsewhere -- this place has no customer service, unkept atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the reviewers here. This place is just not good. 

We went there before a Suns game because every other place was packed. Steve's was empty and now I know why. I ordered their signature Green House Pasta, which was one of the blandest things I'd ever eaten. Our server was so scatterebrained and running all over the restaurant that he forgot part of my order and I still can't figure out why. He didn't appear to have any other tables.....???? He kept saying \"be right with you guys\" every time he left. Uhm, are you trying to tell us that You'll be back? or that you'll see us when you see us? I'm so confused... did you forget that you already helped us?

This restaurant solely survives on business from Hyatt and Wyndham guests that stumble outside and see the first place they can eat. I told our server that I thought my food was awful, and I ate it anyway because I didn't have time to wait for another item nor did I want to risk my food. 

One thing I noticed is the menu says \"we use fresh fish as often as possible.\" What the fuck? So what if you can't get fresh fish? you're going to serve me something less than that? How about \"we only use the freshest fish.\" Or truly, do you sometimes serve unfresh fish?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with time to kill before heading to the airport. An incredibly beautiful October afternoon with temps going up, sitting outside in the shade was delightful, including the many birds and people-watching from this excellent location.

I was seated promptly, it was $6 burger day, so why not? My sweet and seemingly feisty waitress helped me figure out which one (the Cowboy Burger, and it was great), with a $3 on tap Blue Moon beer. Served on a camping type plate, this was just casual enough, and inexpensive enough but delicious enough to last a long time. 

This is perfect for watching sports and hanging around downtown. Think World Series!

I read previous reviews about the staff. I experienced some confusion when delivering my beer, but when I asked the hostess, I found her delightful and helpful. The confused busser was equally kind. My waitress? Great personality and attentive service! 

It's a casual place and I'd recommend it with enthusiasm."}
{"text":"I am not too fond of the dinner experience here, but it is a great place to grab lunch. Lots of choices and generous portions. Steve's is inexpensive for an eatery in the heart of downtown.

Note the cute quotations on the walls."}

Boyfriend had chipotle Mac and cheddar thought that was really good. Soup of day was loaded baked potatoe which was AMAZING!! from CA so next time I'm in town will def go there."}
{"text":"Awful place !!! We went after a baseball game and it's was packed. 30 minutes waiting for a table. The host was dumb. She had not idea what she was doing. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was cold and horrible. My partner got spaghetti primavera and he got spaghetti pesto instead. Never again"}
{"text":"Steve's Greenhouse Grill was a decent lunch spot in downtown. The menu had something for everybody: salads, soups, hot and cold sandwiches, wraps, and burgers. It was a sunny day so my group chose to sit in the patio. The patio was a popular choice and it quickly filled up during peak lunch hour. 

I ordered the grilled salmon sandwich with fruit. (Alternatively, sandwiches and burgers came with choice of tater tots, fries, house potatoes, cottage cheese or cole slaw.) The salmon was cooked just right, although tasted very plain. Good thing the sandwich came with a side of chipotle remoulade for dipping. The sauce spiced up my sandwich. It was a satisfying meal overall and the portion size was perfect for me.

As for service, I thought the hostess who seated my group was trying to force us to sit inside. (No one was sitting inside the restaurant at the time.) She didn't even ask if we wanted to sit in the patio and I insisted that we did, had even pointed out an open table initially, but she had walked away so fast with the menus that she missed our motion. However, our actual waitress was very pleasant and welcoming. We enjoyed her bright and cheery personality.

Price: $10."}
{"text":"Smoking \"in the corners\" outside...what a joke.  Nobody wants to smell your shit.  They need to fix that, asap.

That said, the drinks weren't bad, but the street tacos were awful.  The carne asada must have been marinated in water, because the only flavor I got was that of a griddle that hasn't been cleaned in a long time."}
{"text":"Let me start with the reason I'm giving this place three stars and not two. $3 Blue Moon on tap. That is a beautiful thing. If you're just coming here for drinks you'll be happy assuming you ever get them. We've been here twice now while Phoenix Comicon was going on. It's crowded and noisy but you have to expect that. It's also a little expensive but everything is in downtown Phoenix. It also can take a while to get service and your food. Again, I'd be okay with that if the food seemed like it was not just slapped on a plate in the most haphazard way possible. I ordered a chicken taco salad last night. When I eventually got it, it tasted good but it did not contain a single piece of chicken! I didn't bother to tell the waiter because even though I'm on vacation I don't feel like waiting an hour. The previous time I got the drunken chicken sandwich which looked like it was assembled by an actual drunk.  I mean, fine, if you're going to serve mediocre food that's one thing but don't charge as much as everyone else in the area. I wouldn't recommend getting anything more than an appetizer here, but next time I'm in Phoenix and it's over 100 degrees I'd still probably go in for the Blue Moon."}
{"text":"Our party of eight came in to an empty place to celebrate my birthday.  We sat outside to enjoy the live music which consisted of a guy playing a guitar.  We ordered food and drinks and were enjoying ourselves until the resident street people came around ...along with the owners.  As the woman owner walked in she appeared to try and become confrontational with us but then went inside.  Just after that, our party was told we wouldn't be served anymore and were cut off.  After we explained that none of us were driving they graciously let us stay for a brownie with a candle in it. We were then told we had to leave after I went in to talk to the waitress and the male owner tried to stop and listen to what I was saying to her which made me stop talking until he walked away.  That's when we were cut off.  It was a clear and vulgar display of power. It seemed as though the owners bought a bar so that they and their friends could drink.  I can see now why it was empty.  Good luck with that."}

Food was good, prices fair, good atmosphere. service was very good the first day and marginal the second.

I will definatly eat here agin."}
{"text":"So we came there two days for comicon. They had some awesome deals on drinks and food so me and my mom decided to enjoy some food. Both days we had just horrible servers. The first one acted like he didn't really wanna even be there. And the second one was just never there. The food and the drinks ended up being delicious. We got the margarita deal for comicon and perfect size and perfectly made. Buffalo burger was spot on perfect. And today we got appetizers the white pizza and shrimp wontons. Like I said everything tastes good. But service was bad. The second guy apologized because their co2 broke for their pop machine and were like it's all good. But why did it involve him specifically and not anyone else. Why couldn't you hand us off to someone else to finish up while you fixed the problem. All the other tables looked like they had better servers for some reason. But like I said I would come back for the food and not the service."}
{"text":"Awful service and food just so so. Orders mixed up, think items omitted.  I had the eggs and meatloaf.  Potatoes tasted bad and no toast given.  Spent a lot of time looking for our waitress.  Been in several times before and always satisfied.  Very, very disappointed this time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, rude staff. I felt slightly racially profiled. Never coming back. I've been to this location several times and each time I've gone it's been the same thing. It's almost like they treat certain guests a bit more attentively."}

Thursdays bring about $0.50 wing night, and the sweet honey chipotle is so good! A must stop for good food and friendly people!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Came in at 10:45am was given breakfast menus and was then ignored for 20 minutes. Had to get up to find a server who then informed us we aren't serving breakfast anymore because its 11:05. WTF? We sat here waiting for someone to take our order for 20 min. At that point we left. I would give negative stars if i could. It wasn't busy at all. I guess they don't like making money or serving food. Which is an odd policy for a restaurant."}

{"text":"Cool place to eat and have a beer or two. Maybe even catch a game. My friend and I came on a less busier afternoon. We had a pretty funny, cool entertaining waiter. Food was good with our mandarin salad and veggie patty burger. The waiter was nice enough to have our meals split and everything for us. Only 4 stars because we really didn't have anyone check up on us at all and it took forever for him to bring the bill, run our cards etc...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! For us it's a nice change of pace, big city dinning. Great food, cold beer and friendly staff. Sit on the patio to get that cooling breeze and listen to the latest musician. Oh, and $5 burgers on Wednesday!!!"}
{"text":"Meeh it is just ok.  But I have only ever been here for thier buffet breakfast between 1am and 3am after Pub Crawling downtown.  They manage to work with large crowds well and the food is typical of a hot breakfast buffet.  

I can't speak for their regular menu items, but I do hear they offer a Happy Hour appetizer buffet that I may have to check out sometime."}
{"text":"After a 5 hour flight from Buffalo to Phoenix (excluding layover time), I anticipated eating at Steve's Greenhouse Grill. Judging by my research on what appeared to be a fresh, lively joint, I was more than ready to check it out once I got settled in my hotel. I was seated promptly and brought an iced water soon after. So far so good. Things quickly began to go downhill after I ordered a beer on tap which was brought to me lukewarm...in a plastic cup. The menu was extensive and offered several unique, funky dishes. I decided on the meatloaf dinner but had to change my order since I was informed by my server they were all out. Despite the large offering of menu items, I went for chicken fingers and fries. My server was kind enough to substitute fries for tater tots upon my request. The dish's description claimed it came with your choice of dipping sauce, so when I asked my server for a side of chipotle bbq sauce, he looked at me like I had just asked him for his first-born child. I retracted and asked if it would be all to have that as a side and he said, \"well, we normally just serve it with ranch...\" He obliged, however, to serve the fingers with the sauce. As he walked away with the menu I directed his attention back to my table and reminded him that a salad came with the meal. He double-checked the menu and confirmed that I was correct.

When the main dish came out, I immediately knew the chicken fingers came frozen from a box. I was expecting homemade chicken fingers, but despite this small setback, I do think frozen chicken fingers are acceptable if they are, well, good. They were small and soggy and obviously were not cooked long enough.  This explained why my food came out so quickly. I was never asked by my server if I needed a refill on my water or my beer. Instead, he cleared my plate and immediately brought my check over, thanked me, and wished me a goodnight. This was completely unacceptable and above all, ruined my entire dining experience at Steve's. My server was not outright rude to me or had a bad attitude, he was just extremely neglectful, had zero personality, and was not very personable. He was too wrapped up in doing his job which shouldn't be a criticism by any means because that's what he should be doing. He was, however, too calculated and did not make me feel welcomed whatsoever, which in my opinion should be every server's main priority. Overall, I was severely disappointed with the food and server at Steve's. Drinks and food were delivered at a fast, efficient pace, though but the bad ultimately outweighed the good."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying, I only created an account on Yelp to give this terrible restaurant a review. 
This was my 2nd visit to this restaurant; I was hoping my first experience was maybe that we just caught them on a bad day. 
To start out, the hostess told us there were no seats inside, that the inside tables were only for large parties so we had to sit outside (it was 108 and smelled like nasty beer and mildew). We decided to sit anyway mainly because all the other restaurants near by were packed. Then literally right after she seated us we watched her seat 2 other separate parties of 2 INSIDE! 
The tables were dirty, my arms stuck to ours. The glass O' silverware and the salt and pepper shakers were filthy! Like a layer of grey dirt on them. Then it took 20 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were sitting there, I asked the people at the table next to us who the server was and when I asked the girl she states she's not our server and walks back INSIDE! Finally a girl comes to take our drink orders. I wanted to order everything right away because I was afraid nobody would come back (this happened my 1st time visiting as well) and the girl tells me she's not our server either! Seriously?? So we get our drinks, The beer was warm, had a weird odor and had a soured taste. It was bad. I'm guessing their kegs aren't being stored at the correct temperature. So our waitress finally comes out, she was very nice but she disappeared a lot and we had to wait a long time to get beer refills. I found out later that our waitress had been going to stand in the walk in cooler in between checking on the tables (she actually told us this). We got our food after what felt like forever and it was nothing special, not enough seasoning and my tater tots also had onion rings and French fries in it which I'm guessing is because they don't clean their deep fryer.
Overall, this place is bad :( I will never go back and I will make sure to let everyone I know not to eat there either."}
{"text":"The first thing I would say about this place is don't judge a book by its cover. It looks like a dive bar, but the breakfast was surprisingly good. My wife's poached eggs were done perfectly and our fruit was freshly cut. The toast options were minimal, but that seems to be the standard the further south you get. Unless you want a biscuit. But we didn't. 

My Greek omelet was slightly smaller than I had hoped, and it tasted like it might have been made with liquid egg, but it was really good. The cheese was fresh and it wasn't greasy. My English muffin was toasted well done just like I like it."}
{"text":"We had great service and drank cheap. $3.00 Mai tais all day and happy hour beers made this a great afternoon. Our server Frank was funny and very attentive. Love this place and will return!"}
{"text":"Awkward. Is the best way to explain this place. We went there at about 230pm on a Saturday. It was not busy.   The bartender said hello then walked right by us to talk to the wait staff. He kept talking to them while attempting to take our order.  The wait staff hung out by the bar and bashed their customers the whole time.  

I'm amazed this place is in business...didn't try the food and we didn't dare...

Also, kinda weird that you have to walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick breakfast because it was right next door to the Hyatt! We were promptly greeted by a waitress and seated outside, which was great on a sunny morning. The prices are FANTASTIC and the portions are big. Service was fast and the food(I ordered a BELT with a side of fruit) was great. I definitely recommend Steve's for a quick and cheap meal, especially if you are staying next door at the Hyatt."}
{"text":"The Chili Mac Sundae was tasty! Best skins I've had! Good price for great food. Wings will be next to try, heard Honey Hot Wings are the best."}
{"text":"Steve's, one of Downtown's oldest diners, hosted the after-hours breakfast during Saturday's Downtown Pub Crawl and bravo to the management and staff for recognizing the tremendous opportunity the event presented. 

That night Steve's was transformed from a quaint lunch spot into an open-air discotheque. Amazing.

The patio was packed with Crawlers enjoying their breakfast and dancing to crowd-pleasers like Cupid's \"Shuffle\" and LMFAO's \"Shots,\" with a beer in one hand and yummy bacon in the other. There were moments when I actually forgot where I was and I was sober as a judge!

The $5.95 breakfast was perfect and the staff was super friendly considering the mass of drunken humanity it was dealing with until 3 a.m.

Great job, Steve's!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes blew!  When we asked if they were good, got a strange look and less than reassuring reply for waitress.  I suppose if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all.  Hellish water!!!  Margarita was tasty.  Big zero, not going back."}
{"text":"The meat on the burger was paper thin! I was shocked when she brought it out! The bacon on the burger was also VERY thin. Did not taste good. 
I figured \"well you can't ruin French fries at least\" - wrong. Burnt- looked like they scooped up the left over pieces of fries at the bottom of the bag and threw them into the fryer.

Update: the hostess is turning people away saying \"sorry we are closed for 20 minutes because there's too many customers and not enough servers.\" There's tons of tables open. Customers are asking \"well can we just sit and wait.\" Her response: \"no. I'll get in trouble by my manager.\"
This is bizarre and very awkward - can't wait to get the HELL out of here."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is the location. The service, menu, and food are just mediocre (on a good day). They have a lot of potential, especially by being at such a great location. Steve's Greenhouse would be a great candidate for one of those restaurant makeover shows."}
{"text":"Good food decent prices. My boyfriend had the NY Steak Sandwich with no complaints. I had the Tuscan Chicken Breast. Very juicy and seasoned. The seasoned veggies served with it are good as well. Good service. We went on a Groupon but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This looked really good on YELP. NOT!!  Service is abysmal. 4 tables and 2 servers and I waited almost 12mins before someone came to take my order. Another 15 mins before food arrived. The Denver omelette was okay not great. Server never came back to check on me, I wanted some jam for my toast. After about 15-20 mins I got up and got it myself from the bar!! Someone else finally took my dishes away, didn't ask if I needed anything else. Now I'm sitting here with the check, another 15-20 mins and no one has taken my money yet. Oh and they want cash only. Big city on a St Patrick's Day weekend."}
{"text":"We were seeing a show at Comerica on a Sunday and discovered that many restaurants in the area don't open on this day!  We bought a group on and hoped that we would be one of the people who had a 4/5 star experience and not a 1.
Waitress was very nice and food was prepared adequately.  They were helpful when we asked a couple of questions.  
Honestly, I think what people mind is the décor-we realize that it's a sports bar, but the patio was not ideal to sit in, the inside felt as if it could use a major facelift and they had their paper products (cups, napkins, etc) in full view of all the customers.
Someone was right there to seat us immediately.  it was an okay experience"}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos! Best ever!! Yummy! Yummy!! Great food, great price, great service!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place cuz it was every close to the conference center.  I dropped in twice - once for lunch and another time for dinner.  The street tacos are fabulous and I highly recommend them.  The sirloin steak was ok, a bit tough but cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  The tatertots were deep fried and golden and the local IPA was ice cold.  Together = heaven"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, reasonable prices, and the service is outstanding! What a wonderful experience, outside or inside dining, and live music! Really, check this place out. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a Gold Canyon convention. This became our go to place. The 1st day our lunch service was horrible..very rude waitress. Erica. My food was so so. Chicken sandwich dry, no flavor.We noticed they had some specials that night so we came back. We had bartender helping us. He was great. 50¢ wings! Fantastic..the honey hot are the best wings ever, tarot tots...yum! And the watermelon margaritas and the long island iced tea are the best ive had. This place is definitely the BEST choice around the convention center. A little rough around the edges but for some reason we kept going back and I'd continue to do so during my next convention."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good time here.  We came here after a preseason game for drinks and sat out on the patio.  The service was great.  Its in a pretty cool part of town that you can sit, relax and enjoy the \"downtown vibe\"  From there you can walk to several other places.  We didn't eat but everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. Seems like a place where a lot of fans come before the game as the arena is a short walk away. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place was across the street from my hotel and I was tired so I decided to give it a try. The fish tacos were good and there was a lot of food for $9.50. I went early so the service was good at the bar. The one thing that disturbed me was that they were having a business conversation in the middle of the restaurant. Talking abut who paid what bill and such things. Extremely unprofessional, go to the office for such discussions."}
{"text":"Pretty much what everyone else has experienced here on service.
Had to ask for:
1. Utensils
2. Remind waitress to bring water that we asked for
3. Ask if my meal came with soup or salad rather than just what waitress offered which were just the starch options
After delivering food never came back to check on us other than just give use the check.  When I decided to take the check up to expedite things I couldn't find waitress.  Tried to give it to another waitress running out the back area only to be totally brushed off. WTF?!
BUT, two stars for the decent food.  The meatloaf wasn't bad, the green salad was fresh and hearty, and the burger and fries weren't bad either.  
For some weird reason service in Phoenix as a whole has been terrible.  Maybe it'll get better as our week here continues.
I'm guess there are other choices to eat at than Steve's given the fact that they've had many poor reviews about service and haven't done anything to rectify the problems."}
{"text":"This place is average.  The food does come out quick, but that's about it.  Not bad, but nothing you'll recommend to others."}
{"text":"I went because a) it was across the street & I didn't want to walk too far in the 90 degree heat; b) the menu sounded interesting and maybe a little offbeat; & c) the concierge at the Hyatt Regency said it was really good (no accounting for taste). 

I waited at the the sign that said 'Please wait to be seated' & I waited & waited &... Finally I walked into the main restaurant & asked to be seated. The hostess said \"Oh,I didn't see you\". I guess 10' was too far for her vision in the  less than 1/2 filled place or maybe she was too busy socializing. 

I started with a nice, not great, brew - Devil's ale or something - at the rec of my waiter. I then ordered Chico's meatloaf, the chef 'signature' dish. It is tasteless meat lying on a bed of tasteless soggy fried potatoes & covered with nice but nothing special marinara sauce. It came with two spiceless spicy cajun onion rings and 'eh' enchilada soup of the day. Service was good & the price was right $20.00 with tip but the food & ambiance was lacking.
So if you want an OK nothing special inexpensive meal then it will fill the bill. Otherwise as noted in my tip: Don't go there."}
{"text":"My gf and gave this place three tries as we felt it was only fair. The food was 3 stars each time, no biggie as it is cheap and reasonably priced. The service, however has been regretfully terrible each time. EACH TIME we waited 8-10 minutes before we were even greeted by our servers. At one visit it was actually 17 minutes from entry before we were even brought our drinks. The servers never come to see how your food is or to refill drinks. Twice, I've had to ask them to prebus the table. Twice, it has taken the server 10 minutes to actually run our card and return the bill to us. It's disappointing, we live 2 blocks away and have been looking for a place like this to call our home away from home. Decent food, decent price, terrible service every time. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok.... So the only reason I even went to this place was because I didn't want to re-park my car after I found out \"Cartel\" was a breakfast joint.... In hindsight, I should have re parked my car. 

This place is so very amazingly and exceptionally average. As in like, my stomach was full but not because the food was so good I couldn't help but to eat every last bite, as much it was because I only had an hour for
lunch. Wife ordered a \"tortilla soup\" and some type of healthy rice and grilled veggie meal. The soup was barely edible (salty, over spiced and FULL of corn) and the rice was reheated from cold storage and the grilled veggies were soggy. My Reuben was edible. That's about where that stops but for full disclosure purposes, I'm a bit of a Reuben snob. (See former reviews of the Reuben at Windsor) My daughters burger was meh. Fries and tater toys were deep fried in the same grease that was not only old and badly needed to be changed but also used to fry the fish they were serving for the fish and chips. Gross!! Fishy tasting fries! 
 
Service was below average. Waitress not only had a huge case of the \"idontgivadamns\" but wasn't anywhere to be found except to drop off food and take Initial order.  Decor was dated. I could go on and on. I won't return and I highly recommend going anywhere else downtown besides this place. Hell, the hot dog guy on the corner of Jefferson and central is a 100% improvement from this joint."}
{"text":"Don't know why the low stars, this place is friendly, has good food, super drink specials and has the nicest staff. Found out that my server Mo was also the Manager. Nicest person on earth. Made sure my coffee cup was filled and we got a chance to chat during slow times. My breakfast  (Denver omlete) was excellent!! Exactly how I like it. Price was very reasonable. Can't go wrong eating or drinking at Steve's Greenhouse Grill"}
{"text":"Got a voucher for half off so we used it as a date night.  Hubby's chowder pretty salty, the mere suggestion of cole slaw and his fish & chips were so-so.  I had the California chicken sandwich, fries and blackberry lemonade.  Delicious.  Waitress a gem and the downtown vibe is sweet.  Worth the trip and might be someplace I would go aftet a function downtown."}
{"text":"Average at best... After a solid 10 min, our server finally came over. We ordered the sampler to start, to which he responded \"I don't think we will be able to do that since we're busy\" ummm... So you stop cooking once you get busy? P.s. they were not busy. The food was fine. Nothing to write home about, but not bad."}
{"text":"Convenient early morning breakfast before your convention, with seating outdoors too."}
{"text":"I've been to Steve's a handful of times, including for special events like their Mother's Day Brunch last year and the pub crawl breakfast.  

They are pretty busy during lunch and happy hour, though their happy hour never really struck me as appealing.

Over the years, I have tried many items at Steve's, including their Ostrich burger.  I've decided Steve's does breakfast best.  

Service can be great if you get the right server in the right mood.  Sometimes you get the best, most pleasant service.  Otherwise, you're SOL.  There seems to be no in between!  

Will I go to Steve's again?  Most certainly.  Will I make a special trip out just to eat here?  Nah."}
{"text":"Buffalo burger was really dry. Beer was good & they accommodate a group of 8 but it was so boring. I didn't enjoy a dry $12 burger but Frank, our waiter, was nice. Also cheese is an extra dollar, so is peppers, etc...  Took forever to get the bill."}
{"text":"Can't review the food. Hostess very slow to get to front door as it must of been too hot on patio. Another 10 minutes to get watered down lemonade n watery tea. Waited n waited for server. So we walked out. Too many teenage workers and no adult supervision on site"}
