{"text":"The bouncers just really ruined it for me. They are very rude and look for reasons to show they are tough. Very arrogant men."}
{"text":"It's cougar town there. Most in 40' and 50's. Always packed on weekends after 10pm. The Oxford parking lot gets filled. Got to get there before 10pm"}
{"text":"If your driving in the suburbs of Wexford and take a turn behind one of the many strip malls you will run into this little hidden gem called the Cabana Bar. I haven't been here in years and forgot how this place will instantly transport. This little oasis has Palm trees, sand, fire pits , dj's, cabana's and of course a nice selection of beachy frozen drinks. On the night I went they had $5.00 Long Island iced teas. I ordered the pina colada. The food menu is pretty basic wings, wraps and such. I love that this place has all age groups to your happy hour crowd to your turn up crowd. The dj also played a wide variety of music from Elton John to drake :) If your feein for  the beach and can't get to one this will work as a great substitute."}
{"text":"I love anything off the grill & the food was defin on point. Fell in love with the island scenery, me & the wife just relaxed by the fire pit & enjoyed the night. Will go back any change I get!"}
{"text":"Really cool place.. Good atmosphere.. But the tab situation is LOL.. Got charged for 2 drinks I didn't buy.. Tried to pay my tab with cash.. But they already ran my card.. And way expensive on a Friday night.. Cool happening place.. But be prepared to overpay for drinks.. Food was good.. I got Flatbread pizza.. BBQ chicken ranch.. Really well made and tasty."}
{"text":"In the first time of my life I was turned down for being from out of state. I'm 25 and from Minnesota and I was astonished the when the bouncer said \"we don't accept out of state IDs\". So myself and 4 friends simply left. They were even scanning IDs which confuses even more. Seems like laziness on their part honestly. Unreal. Townies only."}
{"text":"Bartender ignored us didnt ask what we wanted to drink! People besides us finally tracked her down found out they served no food! Zero stars"}
{"text":"My friends and I ventured to cabana bar this past weekend and had a great time! They have a dress code and cover charge but inside is filled with sand, music and fun. Although walking through an empty gym throws some people off its still beautiful. They had about 3 different bars and cocktail servers walking around so it was easy to always have a drink in hand! Only downfalls were the prices and space, it wasn't as big as I had thought or pictured but that's okay I suppose there was seats and standing room
And a small dance floor. The price of drinks was pretty steep. Wexford is a nice area and it is a popular bar so I sort of expected it.. But $5 for a dixie cup of cranberry and vodka was crazy! But still all in all a great place."}
{"text":"Stick to the beer, the drinks are weak . Ordered high end tequila and drink tasted like sugar water. 10 bucks wasted .Atmosphere cool and Beachy. There's a metal detector at the door, not sure if this means they have issues here with guns or what."}
{"text":"My husband's company held a party here. It was our first time at the bar, so we had some difficulty with finding the location. We did not expect the bar to be behind the Oxford Athletic Club. I enjoyed the taste of the burgers, chicken fingers, and salad. The bartender and servers were nice and walked around regularly to ask if people wanted any drinks. I did not have any alcoholic beverages, although they were included, so I cannot comment on them. The setup of cabanas with seats and fire pits looks nice, but I ended up getting sand in my shoes, so I recommend wearing sandals if you go there. After reading the other reviews, I was afraid that they would hassle me over my ID, but no one checked, probably because it was a company party with employees' little kids present."}
{"text":"The Cabana Bar is totally one of the weirdest restaurants I've eaten at; having to park and walk literally *through* the inside of an upscale athletic club in a rich, predominantly white suburb to find a hidden outdoor restaurant replete with real sand, tiki torches, fireplaces, and bamboo huts is far from normal - but this weirdness is a huge part of The Cabana Bar's charm. 

It's the closest you'll get to a beach-themed dining experience in landlocked Pittsburgh (if we're talking about oceans, not rivers). The atmosphere is true to life, with cozy cabanas with thatched rooves, real sand you can dig your toes into, and a sprawling space that doesn't make you feel too close to other diners. This is really nice when it's dark outside, and the staff turns the giant heat lamps on. Big lanterns and torches give everything a warm glow. It's a great casual place to take friends with a fun setting, and it truly feels out of place in WASP-y Wexford (sorry, had to!). 

Unfortunately this spacious, beachy atmosphere lends itself to a loose, casual service. I've eaten at the Cabana Bar three times now on various busy and unbusy days, and I'd say none of my three trips featured exceptional service. Things get missed and take a while. Servers can't always find you easily amongst the rocks, fireplaces, and chaise lounges. 

The food is quite good but nothing groundbreaking, and I do wish they had a larger and more varied menu. Portions a pretty big for the price. It's not all beachy food, either. You can get standard bar fare like pizzas, burgers, and wings. I haven't had alcohol here but the multiple bamboo bars are always packed. 

All in all, the Cabana Bar is a must-visit if you're in the North Hills. Bring friends. Wear flip-flops. Don't expect  best meal you've ever eaten. Come thirsty. You will have a great time!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while b/c I've heard positive things about it.  It's completely out of the way for me, but I have a friend from the North Hills so we met up for dinner and then headed to Cabana bar afterwards.  It's been an athletic club and there's lots of parking, but it gets filled up quickly.  

The place reminds me of Rock Jungle and the Boardwalk - I know I'm totally dating myself by saying that - but I say this in a good way.  It was a perfect night to go to a place like this - warm but not too sticky hot.  There are tables, swings, fire pits, bars, dance area, palm trees - and all outside.  There were so many people and I couldn't believe this many peeps were out in the burbs but it must be a popular spot for them NH folks.  

There were a mix of ages - 20's, 30's, and 40's - I would say the night we went, most people were in their 30's.  The drinks were overpriced, but what can you expect in the burbs b/c this place is probably the only place to really go out.  

All in all, I'm glad I went and if I wasn't feeling as tired as I was that night, I may have enjoyed it even more.  I'm not sure that I'll be back b/c it is quite a hike for me, but if you live in the area this is a great spot in the summer."}
{"text":"The specials were weak. Usually I don't like my drinks too strong, but these are weak. I would be back if others picked the place. Had a few appetizers. They were ok but small."}
{"text":"Pretty nice bar located behind Oxford Athletic Club in Wexford. My friend and I go there sometimes to grab a few beers because theres not may other 'young' bars in the area. 

The specials are so-so (its tough to compare when I'm used to a college town's specials) and its pretty much Cougar Central all the time. We sometimes see a few people we knew from high school, but like I said before, its usually filled with more middle-aged people.

It would be a lot better if they could get more of a younger crowd in, but it may be just my fault that I'm not going late enough when more people my age would be going out. I'll have to go at a later time and update if I notice an age change past a certain time.

But, the sandy spots they have are a pretty cool feature and they also have a few fire pits and some hanging hammock chairs that give you a feeling of being at the beach."}
{"text":"Cool bar located behind the Oxford Athletic Club.  It was raining on the night that I went but it was still really fun.  The only compliant I have is that our margaritas were REALLY salty.  Aside from that, its was fun and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Shout out to Taylor, the sweetest server who was dealing with a bunch of indecisive bachelorette party bitches. She was an awesome host!! Great vibe, definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Somehow I ended up here on a random Friday night. On the outside looking in you would never guess the awesomeness that is in the backyard. I was greatly surprised by how big this venue is. There are two bars, a dance floor,  multiple firepits,  life sized beer pong and sand. I absolutely sat by the fire with my feet in the sand devouring their five dollar long islands they have on special. The staff here are very attentive also. It's almost as if they have a radar to see if your cup is empty. My only complaints are the DJ really sucked. He had a special power that included clearing the dance floor. And although the place closed at 2am he stopped playing his terrible choice in music at 1am. I come from a family of DJs and hearing his mixing made me sad. I will return though for the beach scene and the great drink specials. They also serve food for the hungry."}
{"text":"How many places exist with this atmosphere in Pittsburgh? None. Sandy sitting areas around countess fires pits, live DJ, dancing, and the overall tropical decor will entertain your group into the wee hours of the night. The drink menu is small, but gets the job done. The place gets packed on a Friday night, but not over crowded. There's a lot of space and it's a great energy."}
{"text":"On a warm summer night I really felt like I was back in So Cal near the ocean.  They have plenty of tables, swings, fire pits, bars, dance area, palm trees and sandy play areas. There were so many people and I couldn't believe how scantily clad the ladies were dressed.   

The age range was mixed from 12 to older than dirt.  I would guess the night we went, most people were in their 20's.  The drinks were overpriced, the bar staff was conceded but what can you expect in one of the only cool places to go in the burbs."}
