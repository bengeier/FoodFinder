{"text":"Great place to eat! Great ramen and comfortable seating. nice music. good place.  nice ceiling fans."}
{"text":"Been here 3 or 4 times and it is always consistent.  Love their ramen especially the soup base- it's slightly thicker than other noodle shops I have been to.  My kids and I love the fried chicken rice.  My kids go there just to eat that!  The fried octopus balls wasn't quite what I had in mind...it was a bit ooey in the center...and maybe that's the way it should be ?  I just found the texture a hit unusual.     OverAll: great comfort food.  Lunch special - ramen and chicken rice is a good price for parents and kids to share!"}
{"text":"Worst ramen in town... I regret not walking 10 seconds longer to reach the nearby convenient store for some better ramen.   I ordered the black ramen + mille crepe combo. Mille crepe was good, so they probably didn't made it themselves. It was a tiny pitiful piece for $5.50.   Ramen had about 2 bites of noodle within, plus a single slice of meat. I would happily pay for the $10.50, but it tasted like feet."}
{"text":"New establishment in the heart of downtown  Here is my breakdown  Pork - got the original definitely one of the best  Soup - got their garlic with shoyu, intense garlic burnt garlic flavour (which I like) but the soup temperature is warm borderline cold. Texture wise is VERY thick reminds me of a sauce more than a soup must be the chicken stock they use  Noodle - got thin noodle tastes fresh and homemade but doesn't have the egg taste as it is overpowered by the soup  Service - very disorganized stood in line for 8 minutes with no greetings or acknowledgment, understandable since they are new establishment  Price - got meat lover for 13.00 average price for a bowl of ramen  Thoughts - if you are in the area worth checking it out, this ramen is different from the ones I've tasted so far. I won't be going back as the saucy soup ruined the ramen for me, chugged 1L of water after this meal. The meat is definitely a highlight"}
{"text":"I ordered the original chicken ramen and the broth tasted like I was drinking oil. I won't be coming here."}
{"text":"I've been to several Ramen places in Toronto (Momofuku, Santouka and now Touhenboku). Touhenboku is my current favorite.   We had the white/soy broth which was rich and delicious. Lean pork was not awe-inspiring, but quite tasty and I had no complaints. But the noodles (I chose the thick, which were only slightly thicker than the thin ones) were chewy and so unbelievably good, they were enough to make me want to go back again, soon. I'd probably have the light broth next time. I don't do well with too much fat in my food, even if it's very tasty fat.   Had the combo, which turned out to be too much food for lunch, so it came home with me. The Chashu don (pork, told them to hold the mayonnaise) was absolutely delicious and great warmed up for dinner later.   My friend had their green tea which was flavored with peach, and she really liked it.  We went around 2pm on a weekday. Great service, very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be going back.  ---  ETA: Another reviewer mentioned an unpleasant smell in the place. It's the musty basement, and that smell only comes up when the door to the basement is opened. I noticed it at the end of our meal. Anyway, it's nowhere near the kitchen and dissipated quickly. Just wanted to note that this has nothing to do with the food, imo (and perhaps management may be able to deal with it in the near future)."}
{"text":"These are the best ramen noodles in Toronto! They use a machine (which costs a whopping $40k) to make the noodles from scratch and they are delicious!  There is a choice of white, red (spicy), black (garlic), and light ramen. The best one is black - it is super tasty! It is also really thick - not less than 5 mins after finishing eating, a film had formed over the remaining broth.  There is also a choice of lean/normal pork or chicken chashu. I opted for the chicken which turned out to be a patty made from several separate pieces of tasteless chicken - highly would not recommend. There is also the option of thin or thick noodles - the thin noodles were the hit of the evening (and apparently the thick noodles are similar to udon).   The portions are pretty small so we had to subsidize the ramen with yakitori don. It was tasty and the meat was tender but it could have used more teriyaki sauce.  The service was terrible - they forgot our order and mixed up our order twice, but I'm hoping it was due to the busyness and still being a relatively new restaurant - hopefully they will soon work out these kinks."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of a friend who had been here several times. We both ordered the ramen noodles with sea salt. I had ordered the one with chicken while she ordered pork.  Although I was happy to have the sea salt option and the soup base wasn't too salty, I was very disappointed that the chicken was cold as I was expecting it to taste hot (this soup is supposed to be hot after all!). Furthermore, the chicken wasn't even real chicken, but almost like a reconstructed deli/spami version of it.For $10.50, it came with this questionable one small piece of meat, which I think is a total rip off.   Note: The pork ramen I believe appears like real pork.  The soup itself wasn't as hot as I would have expected.   Food Value-D Food Quality-D Ambience-B Service-B  Summary- Save your time and money and go elsewhere for better quality and value."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto, bar none!  The (vastly different from other ramen) chicken stock is intensely flavoured (and I usually don't like chicken except grilled), leaner and tastier than pork broth and more widely accessible to those who dislike or don't eat pork. The toppings fresh and the \"chashu\" tasty. The fried chicken Karaage is nice and crunchy as well with Japanese mayo (yes it's different) and lemon.  The noodles are made in house in a very expensive machine (and apparently most places in Toronto just buy them, don't make) and the best part - not overcooked, but with a nice firm and silky texture with flavour that I have yet to find in Toronto (for ramen noodles). The half boiled egg is cooked perfectly and the flavour of the broth is consistent every time. A must try and really has become an addiction for me. I usually go for the spicy or the black garlic ramen (the latter might not be not for all, especially if you have a date after) and then add more chili oil to it with copious amounts of shichimi!   After being blown away the first time I had it, I researched and apparently the founder is well known in Japan and attended the \"Cordon Bleu\" of ramen schools in Japan. 5 star, and this is after I've had it probably greater than 20x in the last 3 months. I attribute at least 3lbs of weight gain to this place."}
{"text":"First time here and wanted to get ramen but saw the Don Buri for 6$ and ordered without hesitation. Got the pork belly Don Buri and found it flavourful but a little too salty. Also 6$ means a small portion so take caution! It's about the size of a typical bowl of rice at other restaurants with the meat topping.   I just wish there was a little more sauce on the Don Buri but it still delivered. It was pretty empty during Lunch Rush Hour on Monday but heard it gets really busy on Fridays so plan ahead. Even though it was empty, the service wasn't super up to par as they had servers in training on floor and had a language barrier that could not answer our questions, just a heads up if you're in a rush.  Overall, a good experience but definitely have to come back and try their ramen which they're known for!"}
{"text":"We Went here for quick late night dinner after a business meeting. The food was excellent but the service was beyond anything we've ever experienced for a restaurant of this price range especially since we came in just before closing time. The staff were very helpful, incredibly friendly and very polite with strong Japanese roots. We did not feel rushed at all and they conversed with us and were genuinely very pleasant and happy people!  We got to meet and talk with the owner, who even introduced us to the chefs.  We met the entire staff working that night! The owner is a stand up guy who loves his business and line of work and it's clearly evident.  He even gave us dessert on the house which we must say is the best cheese cake we all have ever tried! It was full of flavour but it was light. It didn't have the heavy feeling of traditional cheese cake,  it was fluffy and just so delicious! We also got some sort of layered crepe cake which was also very unique but incredibly delicious as well!  Needless to say, we all have nothing but good things to say about this place and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Gross.  I saw the reviews for this place and decided to try it, because the location was close and I love ramen. But my experience was less than average - I can't believe this restaurant has an 80%. It seems like the Queen West strip for food has gone wayyy downhill recently.  Anyways, I walked in and the first thing I noticed was this odd smell that has been in a lot of restaurants on Queen - almost like a sewage problem. I tried to ignore it, and I just wanted something quick as it was late. I was greeted by the staff - everyone was so overly friendly. I definitely give them that, they were super attentive and kind. I ordered the \"Original\", and it looked fine until I saw the broth. It  was definitely not the right thickness, it seemed to come from a package or some kind of chemical/MSG sort of concoction. This ramen did not even come close to the Ramen I had at Kenzo (Yonge and Steeles). Touhenboku's ramen noodles seemed generic, the broth was so disgusting, frothy and had little soap bubbles around the edges - it was inedible. The broth was basically unnatural. The ingredients were basic. I tried a few bites and then found a long, black hair next to the seaweed or whatever it was and got a to-go container and left, to throw it out in the garbage outside the store. *felt bad for the environment, but I will make up for it.*  I was really really disappointed, because I had high hopes - but the smell, the chemical broth and the hair (cherry on the cake) just did it for me. I had to get out of there.  Once again, Queen West has proven to me that I will not be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Touhenboku is a great new addition to the neighborhood. Since my first initial visit, I've caught myself visiting for take out, perhaps a bit too often!   The menu is easy to navigate, and the quality of the broth, noodles and meat were all fantastic. My first ramen order included their \"creamy\" & spicy option - however, it was a bit too rich for my taste.   I've since tailored my choice to the \"light broth\" with sea salt (thin noodle) offering and it is exactly what I would expect for go-to hot ramen on a cold day. Portions are generous and always piping hot.   The service has always been very perky and cheery (on arrival and departure). The location is bright, clean and cozy. I arrived to eat in at 5:30pm and the place was quiet. By 6:15pm, there was a line up out the door.   In addition to the ramen, I've tried the following:   - Gyoza - good, hot... not sure I'd order again (not a stand out item) - Karaage - good, sauce drizzle was tasty, added something heavier to round out the meal - Korokke - really yummy! Creamy potato croquette type appetizers that were crunchy, unique and must try - Mille Crepes - light dessert, sweet and very creamy  Overall, I plan on visiting this location again and again - not only for take out, but for sit in meals as well."}
{"text":"Out of all of the ramen places in Toronto, this is probably the worst one that I've tried so far.  The noodles and sides in the bowl were pretty good, but it was the broth that was the real issue here.  I went here for lunch with one of my friends and we both ended up feeling a bit sick afterwards. Thankfully, the feeling went away after we walked it off on Queen St W. The broth was just so oily and greasy that a layer of film would form if I leave the bowl untouched for a minute. Never had this problem with other ramen places. Probably won't be back any time soon..."}
{"text":"Really comforting Ramen. And i didn't have to stand in a line (as in NYC or SF)! Chicken broth is rich and creamy. Good experience!!"}
{"text":"3.5* Decent ramen spot. Love the decor and the wait staff is attentive to your needs.  About 30 seats + 6 bar spots.  Great value when you're extra hungry.  $13 will get you double meat (4 pieces) + 0.50 for an extra bowl of noodles.  Waitress suggested a warm peach tea (premium! $1.50) which was nice in this -18degrees weather. The peach fragrance was delightful.   I asked for half lean pork and half chicken cha siu. Both were perfectly seasoned and not dry. They offer 4 types of soup base; I chose black but wasn't a fan of it. It was supposed to be garlicky, but not enough for me. it had more of a charcoal flavour than garlic. So I was a bit disappointed there. Can't beat Kinton's spicy garlic ramen...mmmm Noodles were nice, though I would've preferred more al dente.   Our kind waitress offered toragashi (sp?) pepper spice, which was not fragrant, and sriracha for my friend's chicken karaage. the karaage wasn't crispy enough... maybe the oil wasn't hot enough? Or their potato starch ain't cutting it. chicken itself was juicy and offered with mayo dipping sauce.   Their flavours are decent, but the broth didn't satisfy my ramen cravings. I'd try it again, but it's not on my A-list."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen. Very authentic and tasty. Very nice service. Not too crowded. Good atmosphere. We had a late supper there. Will be perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Although the place and food look good, if you are a ramen lover like me and wants to go to a ramen place for a decent ramen, I would recommend Santotei or Kenzo. Touhenboku's ramens are just ok, don't really make me crave for them and go back there."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant many times in 2016 since my boyfriend really loved the food. It's a solid ramen shop that doesn't use MSG and has one vegetarian option. They have since increased the prices on their menu but is still reasonably priced. I will not be going as often, but still a strong restaurant for Japanese food in the area."}
{"text":"Wandered in on a whim and was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem.  I dined at their uptown location.  I think  it is better than most of the better Ramen places. Loved the fact you can chose thin or thick noodles.  The broth was delish! Had the white broth with plain ol sea salt. Super glad to have spotted this place so I don't have to go all the way downtown and stand in line ups! AND they have Millie crepes!  Can't wait to try them the next time I am back."}
{"text":"We came at 10 pm and still the place was packed.  We ordered original with miso soup, another with spicy soup and fried chicken snack.   Overall, the food is good..not sure why they charge 1.50 for miso to add to the soup, and then 1.00 for meat.  I did not bother arguing the bill as the food came promptly , with courteous service.  But you should ask about how they charge you ....  The service is the best party of the meal! Followed by the eggs in the soup.."}
{"text":"For a small ramen joint, they make above average food. I had the reg white ramen bowl and my boyfriend had the garlic ramen. Everything was great, good portion sizes, good service. The restaurant is surrounded by the amazing Yonge st shopping boutiques that make it that much more appealing. I would definitely come back. Paying for parking doesn't bother me, it comes with living / coming to Toronto."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch and tried the classic Touhenboku Ramen broth with the Karaage on rice. Quite delicious and filling. Ramen comes with all the right fixings, and the Karaage was a perfect accompaniment. Very reasonably priced draft Sapporo rounded the meal perfectly."}
{"text":"This place probably has to be the last if you are ranking Toronto's ramen places.   Rice was hard which can be a good thing for keeping fit - as you are basically spending 2 minutes chewing for every bite of rice. The chashu on the rice was dry and salty, had one bite and that was it for me.  The soup was simply think and oily, referencing another yelper's comment, it tastes horrible. Salty, oily and nothing else. The packaged ramen I bought from Japan tastes better than that. Oh and the portion was small, it's not just regular \"Japanese cuisine\" small, it's \"oh sorry I ordered main not appetizer\" small."}
{"text":"This is my very first review and and the lucky winner goes to...well Touhenboku obviously.   First, I love customization. They let you pick the soup base, noodles, meat and veggies, and then other additionally charged extras. I had the garlicky broth with rice noodles and pork shoulder and it was good but tasted a little burnt. Was that the intention im not sure, but im willing to give it another shot.   My gf had a light chicken broth with pork belly ramen and it was delicious.   We also ordered a karaage appetizer and the whole meal came under $30. Which in this area is very reasonable. I think a positive review is warranted."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the ramen was actually better than some of the ramen I had in Japan! Delicious soups, very hearty, decently priced, good service. Wish I discovered it sooner! I also highly recommend the Korokke, they were surprisingly delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is clean. The staff were friendly and attentive. I ordered the chicken chili ramen and it changed my life. This was delicious."}
{"text":"With so many different ramen places around, the new places really have their work cut out for them.  I stopped by for lunch today and was promptly greeted and sat down.  The décor is nice, places isn't that big so the tables are close together.    I ordered the lunch set, ramen with Donburi.  I choose the clear light chicken soup with thick noodles with lean pork and kara-age (fried chicken on rice) donburi.     I've never been a big fan of the thick pork bone based soups so I rather enjoyed the thin broth.  It was not too salty that I find other ramen places tend to be.  The lean pork is a nice option that I much prefer to pork belly, the ramen was chewy and had nice bite .  Overall very good.  The only thing I can criticize is the portion for $10.50 is not that much.  But with the kara-age don, it's not too bad.    I would come back and try the spicy broth next time.  Good addition to the Queen West area.  Restaurants need a bit of time to work out the kinks so maybe that's why the early reviews were a bit mixed.  So 3.5 stars for now rounded up to 4.  Will go back again and see if it's as consistent as they wish they claim to be on the website."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in GTA.   Been to this place 3 times in 2 months.  I have visited a number of Ramen shops in Tokyo, and this came pretty close to the best there.  Pros: - Rich Ramen Soup - Good price - Decent Portions - Addictive Millie Crepes - Authentic Japanese service  Cons: -  Whole restaurant seats about 50 people max.  But turn over is quick usually."}
{"text":"Good ramen, definitely better than Kinton, IMO. You choose your broth, seasoning, ramen and meat. I had the black garlic broth with soy sauce, thin ramen and pork shoulder. The broth was rich but not greasy. I wouldn't have known it wasn't pork broth if I didn't look at the menu. There was a smoky aroma from the pork.   They have a lunch set which is a bowl of ramen and a don for $14 (savings of $1). My other half had the kaarage don with his set. It was rather ordinary, definitely come here for their noodles and not the rice bowl.   Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Many ramen places opened up in Toronto gives me a lot more options, yet make me more picky on ramen as well. Went there on a very cold day, ordered the very basic Shio Ramen, which I always do at a new ramem place.   Soup was a little too oily, and flavour is too light.   Noodle was ok, but Sansotei is still on my priority list. Meat was just fair.  Nothing surprisingly good.  We ordered the deep ftied Potato croquette and that is indeed pretty good.  My friend ordered the rice and its ok.  Just a little reminder, their rice is a side dish size, so if you are looking for sonething filling, ramen is the choice.    Overall, I am not very into the ramen here as the soup base to me is a very important element for ramen.  Its a place you can have an initial visit, but not somewhere I will come back particularly for the food.   Service here was good though!"}
{"text":"I love it. It's very close from my office, so I go often for lunch. From 12 to 1 y completely full. Prices are very reasonable, normally I pay $14 for a ramen with Miso and pork belly. Really love the fact that the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"First off, I did not try their ramen, although that's what they are known for - because I already had soup noodles that day and didn't want to repeat.  I ordered the kara-age don, my friend ordered the yakitori-don with Korokke. I tried the Korokke and it reminded me of croquettes, but without the meat. My kara-age don was delicious, perfectly fried without being too oily.   Since the dons are small - understandable given its pricing, I also ordered dessert. I asked the server and they recommended mille-crepes. This is so delicious! It reminded me a bit of mille-feuille, but with crepe texture, it was served chilled with cream between the crepe layers and some honey drizzled over it. It is so awesome.  I will be back, if only for the delicious mille-crepe."}
{"text":"3.5*  Was here for lunch on a Friday, the wait was around 5-10min which is quite normal if you go around noon time to any dt restaurants. You can choose a number of soup bases, type of noodles and meat. I got the light version with thin noodles and chicken which was around $10  The servers were very friendly and often came by to apologize for the wait for the food. I believe the owner of the restaurant came out as well to give us 10% coupons for the wait for next dine in. The food was flavourful, however it was lacking meat as there was only 1 piece of chicken there.  Not a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"I took the family to introduce them to ramen and we had a wonderful time. I have to admit I am not a ramen connoisseur but I have enjoyed my bowl every time I have gone.   I have tried a few combinations and I definitely overdid it the first time (garlic and miso is too much in one bowl IMO) but on their own they are great. I want to try a lighter one next time and branch out a bit.   Bottom line is I found the service excellent (they even came over and gave the kids some key chains and stickers which was unexpected) and they kept my water topped up (truly the sign of a good restaurant - only the best restaurants do this without asking) and were quick with food and drinks."}
{"text":"An alright Ramen place, definitely the pork based Ramen is far superior to the chicken based Ramen. Unfortunately , they are very stingy on the portion and especially the meat slices , instead of having 3 slices of meat there is only 1 miserly slice of selected meat in the bowl. The Chicken broth is tasty overall with the sea salt base flavour, definitely they need to add more of the standard condiments such as green onions, scallions, bean sprouts to the Ramen bowl to give the chicken broth a more tasty and powerful flavour. The Men : noodles is very bland on its own but becomes juicer and flavourful once immersed in the broth for awhile.  If you crave Takoyaki , it's not the best tasting one but worth a try ,the sauce is to Western tasting and leaves your mouth with a sweet and soar tasting mucus similar to a lot of American cuisine.  Overall , another decent place to satisfy ones Ramens craving ."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place. The waitress wasn't very knowledgable about the beer selection and the soup made me feel so sick after I had it."}
{"text":"Having many experiences of visiting lots of ramen restaurants in Japan, I would say they serve great ramen dishes. I usually order black with rich pork and thin noodle and you can't be wrong. Sometimes you have to wait for a long time to be seated (obviously it's a busy place) but it's worth waiting."}
{"text":"SERVICE Horrible service.  They could not even tell me or find out if they would be open on a holiday a few days away.  They said they would call me back shortly with the answer, but never did.  I asked for tea, so they brought me hot water with lemon then advised me there would be a charge for tea.  Really?  I ordered tea because I intended to pay for it.  I am curious about their logic and not sure if I should be offended if they assumed I wasn't in a position to pay.  I ordered an appetizer and specifically mentioned it was to hold me over until my delayed guest arrived.  They brought the appetizer at the end of my meal ---- long after I figured they forgot and didn't really want it anymore.   To be fair, I do believe there is a language barrier.  The staff seem genuinely polite and well meaning, but are extremely inexperienced.  I would not bring anyone here if you are trying to make a good impression since confusion at each of my dining experiences there created a disruption to guests and became the focal point.  UPDATE:  I'm happy the owner reached out to me and appreciated suggestions and feedback.  So I look forward to (hopefully) an improved dining experience next time and increased the star rating from 2 to 3.  AMBIANCE Loft feel gives it a hip vibe. They do not ventilate their kitchen properly, so I went home smelling like fryer oil.  Ugh.  And, I had just dry cleaned that fall wool coat.  FOOD Gyozas are greasy and average tasting. Korokke are potato croquettes (deep fried mashed potato logs) that are lacklustre. Karaage (crispy chicken nuggets) is tasty, but rich and rather filling.  White and Black Garlic Ramen are both above average.  I like that you can customize nearly every aspect of the ramen.  Do not expect a large of meat in the ramen; it is only a really thin slice, but pork belly and chicken are both excellent.  Eggs are soft boiled (slightly runny center).  Donburi bowls (rice bowls with choice of topping) are hit or miss --- especially since they drown some with too much Japanese mayo (thicker than Hellman's).  Medium grain rice (think sushi rice without the tang).    The ramen-donburi bowl combo is enough to fill up most people without the need for other courses.  I usually feel like I need something in addition to the ramen to feel satisfied.  Crepe dessert is fun, but not for everyone.  Layered with whipped cream, atop thin piece of fluffy white cake.  Topped with a citrus (maybe yuzu) marmalade.  HANDICAP ACCESSIBILITY Must step up then jog right to get inside the building, which likely poses problems for wheelchairs, walkers or those with balance issues. Half of the seating is bench seating and the other half is chairs, so a wheelchair could pull up to table.  I do not recall there being arms on chairs. Washrooms are down steep stairs in the basement.  OVERALL I like the food enough to return... but only if I have lots of extra time to allow for service hiccups and delays."}
{"text":"While I've been to Touhenboku before and never had an issue, last night was HORRENDOUS. First, no one greeted me and my friend when we entered and stood in the doorway waiting to be acknowledged. After finally seating ourselves, requested water and ordered our meals - it took about 40 minutes for our ramen to arrive. Patrons arriving after us were getting their food before ours. I understand this sometimes happens so I tried to pay it no mind. I ordered the vegetarian ramen and emphasized no egg when ordering. I was surprised when it was brought out with, you guessed it, egg right on top. I told the server I ordered it without egg so I am unable to eat this and asked for another to be made. She said \"Do you want me to bring you a small bowl to take the egg out?\" No. I do not. I want my order to be correct. Instead of taking the bowl back to rectify the error, my food remained on the table for another 10-15 minutes while the server stared at me and gossiped with her coworker. It wasn't until the manager was serving another table, turned to us and asked what was wrong, that things would finally get fixed. I explained how I ordered the ramen without egg, was served my order with egg, I told the server and was unsure if I was getting another or not since she had left the table and never returned. He said he would fix it right away. Thankfully my new ordered arrived in 5 minutes -- which begs me to ask why it took 40 minutes to begin with  We had also ordered dessert as part of their dinner special of ramen + dessert for a set price after 5pm. In fashion with the evening, when we got our bill that the special wasn't reflected and had to get that corrected after having to explain it to the same server who seemingly did not care about my incorrect order. It very well could have been they were having a bad night but my patience wore thin. I will not come here again.  If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Our first visit here, one Thursday evening. The place was packed (always a good sign).  They managed to get us a table after a short wait. The menu was clear and the staff were friendly and helpful. We tried the white and red ramen as I like spice.  We also ordered the gyoza dumplings.  Everything  arrived in good time and was exactly what we expected. We'll be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. You have your choice of variation of soup base and mix. Noodle thick or thin. I selected red (spicy) salt base and thick noodle. The soup was creamy with the right amount of spice, the noodle were chewy and right on. The tea egg was a nice extra. However, I wish it would also include an extra slice of meat.  Also tried the layer crepe cake. Layered in fresh cream and sweetness of fruit compote.  Its priced right too."}
{"text":"Went to this place today on a friday night. Newly opened but line-up was not crazy. The place is quite small so I can imagine it being hard to get a table for a large party.    The food was okay. The soup was way too thick for my preference, soup was not hot enough.   They only a few types of ramen to choose from, I just spicy but it was not spicy at all.  I don't live in dt toronto so I probably would not go back to this place for their food however they had great service there. Waiter kept checking up on us and asking how everything was and they also asked us how there food was when we were leaving again."}
{"text":"The service and food are consistently excellent. I've gone about 10 times and haven't had any issues.  This place specializes in chicken broth based ramen which is either rare or otherwise non existent in Toronto (I'm not a ramen expert,so not 100% sure). Generally you're going to be served Pork based broth ramen, so this place stands out in Toronto. The broth is rich and creamy, very flavourful and delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the ramen dishes. For my tastes, their chicken karaage is perfect. It has a very clean taste as though the frying oil and equipment is ultra clean, and is just insanely delicious fried chicken.  Some folks I go here with order their soup unseasoned, or half seasoned with sea salt to reduce their sodium intake which is a tip you may want, although I personally go for the full shot of sea salt!   If you even remotely enjoy ramen or the style of side dishes they serve, I'd say this is a must-try place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to give it a try after reading on Toronto Life that they make their own ramen fresh everyday.  We got here at around 1pm on a weekday and were seated in about 5 minutes. I ordered the original touhenboku ramen with lean pork and thick noodles in a shoyu soup base.  The size was just right. I was full after finishing the bowl. The consistency of the soup was thicker than normal, which I wasn't such a big fan of. The noodles were ok, but my egg was a bit overcooked (I like my egg yolk oozing out) and the pork was lukewarm/cold when i ate it (even though it was the first thing i ate).   All in all, I think there are better ramen places around so I don't think I'll be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This place has really deteriorated.  The Black Ramen had so much garlic that is was inedible.  I judge Japanese restaurants by their miso shiro and gyoza. If they can't do these two basic things well, it is unlikely anything will be very good.  The gyoza at Touhenboku on Queen  West was tasteless and swimming in oil. I pointed this out to the waitress who did nothing about it  When the restaurant first opened, it was much better.  I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Broth was plain and salty. The meat was rough and overcooked. The portion was small. There are much better ramen places nearby to spend your money on"}
{"text":"If I look  past the hype and base my review on the food alone I think a 3 star rating is fair for this place.  They do use chicken broth rather than the regular tonkatsu pork broth but I much prefer the later.  I had the lunch combo and for a girl its probably a decent portion but can't see my guy friends getting full off a bowl here.  Prices per bowl are slightly cheaper than others but again portion size is a bit smaller."}
{"text":"Different people have different preference for the richness of ramen broths, but I have to say that the one at Touhenboku is a bit oily for my taste even when I get the light version. The karaage don on the other hand was tasty. But...the real highlight for me was definitely the cream puff. From the description it sounded like a heart attack but it was actually so light and fluffy and amazing!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see this location is as good as the one downtown, plus more.    The decor was interesting with a lot of industrial bricks and beams.  It is much like their location downtown in that the Ramen menu is familiar.  The biggest difference was in the appetizers   I had the baked oysters (Oyster Isobeyaki) which came on a bed of salt.  Normally I prefer my oysters raw, but this was a nice substitute.  A squeeze of lemon also smartens them up nicely.   I also ordered the Kakuni which is the braised pork belly with a seasoned egg but unfortunately forgot to take a photo of it.  The pork as very tender and fatty which to me was very reminiscent of mei-tsai co-rou which is a Chinese dish.  It was my favorite of the three appetizers.  The third appetizer I ordered was the Ebimayo. These are prawns with spicy chipotle sauce.  This appetizer was excellent. My friend preferred this one and could have easily just ordered multiples.  Afterwards we each had a bowl of Ramen.  I has the white, which is not my normal soup and he had the red.  Both were excellent, but I still prefer the red.  we didn't have dessert but I could see it was similar to the one on Queen, yummy!.  I wish it was closer to Eglington station, it's a nice neighborhood to walk around in but when you're that full it's a little uncomfortable to waddle down Yonge street. I didn't notice any music, like the first reviewer complained about but it was rather busy when I was there.   I will probably stay at the one downtown, it's easier for me to get to, but I would love to see some of these exciting appetizers brought to Queen."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and very tasty food. Not sure what else you want in a restaurant. The prices are very reasonable. I love the karaage rice bowl the most. SUPER tasty!"}
{"text":"It was wonderful here! The bowl of ramen I ordered was really filling, creamy, and rich. I ordered a spicy ramen and it was a bit more mild then expected, but everything else didn't disappoint. I also ordered the dumplings and squid balls which was a nice touch too what we already had. Service was nice, quick, and friendly. It's a very clean place compared to other places I've been too and decor is nice."}
{"text":"Just ordered from this restaurant on Foodora. I ordered the original Ramen with miso and chicken and Goyza dumpling appetizer.    The dumplings were amazing. Very tasty and perfectly cooked. Soft but not mushy and slightly crispy.  The ramen was awful. It was the worst ramen I have had in Toronto. The broth was very bland, even with the miso added. The noodles were just a giant glob. Even when they were added to the broth, they would not break up, they just stayed as a glob. The chicken was the worst part. The chicken was random bits of white meat, dark meat and cartilage, bonded together with some kind of meat glue and some salt and pepper added. I literally gagged when I tried it. Considering my appetizer, ramen and driver tip was almost $34.00, I am really upset with the terrible quality. I will never try Touhenboku again. DO NOT EAT HERE. If you want good ramen, go to Kenzo Ramen instead.  UPDATE: It has been 18 hours since I ate this ramen, most of which I have spent on the toilette. This food made me really sick. Vomiting and diarrhea.  UPDATE 2: It's been 25 hours since I ate this crappy ramen and I still have diarrhea. Considering my first impression of the food from this restaurant, I'm not surprised. Their obvious low food standards is apparently echoed by their low sanitary standards.  UPDATE 3: 42 hours, still sick."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy for lunch and this place was solid. Their lunch special was a great value, no lines and the service staff were friendly. I was stuffed and definitely will be making another trip back here during the winter!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in town for great price.   Just get here after the lunch rush  Love the meat lover special and you can choose between 3 meats and 4 soup combinations"}
{"text":"Came here when it first opened and wasn't impressed. HOWEVER, I came back after a couple of years later and I'll admit, Touhenboku has won me back.  Food (4/5): So now you order your food in steps. 1) soup base (white, spicy, black, light), 2) seasoning (miso, soy sauce, salt), 3) noodle type 4) protein. I got the white soy sauce with thick noodle and pork belly. YUMMMMM. The broth had the perfect amount of fat such that the consistency was right between runny and thick and the saltiness was well balanced (unlike Kinton... heh). It went really well with their circular shaped pork belly which i really enjoyed because it was cut so thin that it was easy to rip with your chopsticks and have small bites with every noodle mouthful :) The only downside to this meal were the noodles, which I don't believe is fresh, but meh, it was a lovely bowl of ramen regardless. I also had the takoyaki here and I've got to agree with other yelpers that it's a bit gooey-er than other places, but I still enjoyed the octo-balls haha.  Cost (4/5): I paid $13.50 for the bowl and split a couple dollars with my group of friends for the takoyaki. I left feeling really satisfied, so I'd say that at this price point, money well spent.  Service (3.5/5): Standard service, nothing special and nothing to really complain about. We came on a Friday night, during prime dinner time, and we were able to get a table for 4 right away. The bowl of ramen came out fairly quick, we barely noticed the time go by, and they serviced us when needed.  Ambience (4/5): It's a cute place, probably seats around 25? The exposed brick, wood walls/seats and chandeliers gives it an eclectic vibe. I like that it's a well lit space (not dim) and for a packed restaurant it wasn't loud at all.   Really enjoyed my second time back to touhenboku and would recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this past week, restaurant was full but me and my fellow diner were seated promptly. Service was prompt and very friendly! We got our food less than 10 minutes after ordering.   Got the Miso base with thick noodles and chicken -- it was excellent! Hearty and flavourful and portions are generous (9.5/10)  We also got the Kanji chicken which was also good (7.5/10) and splurged for the Godzilla's egg -- sounded far too interesting to pass up! :) (7.5/10)  I plan on returning often as I live in the area!"}
{"text":"As I was walking on Queen Street, saw this place under renovation. The next time I walked by, they posted the sign that it opening on Wednesday. So on Friday, met up with a friend to try this place. I got here around 6:30pm and the place was filled with a few tables waiting, the line wasn't outside yet. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. The place was small so not much room in between tables. As we were waiting, they gave us a menu to look at and the waitress wrote down our orders so once we sat down, we put our orders in.  The food came pretty quick, I got the Garlicky Touhenboku Ramen - Touhenboku Ramen with special blend garlic oil. Served with Chashu (roast pork), seaweed, tasty boiled egg, kikurage mushrooms and green onion. I got the thick noodles and the sea salt soup base. Even though I got the thick noodles, it was like the normal ramen from other places. The texture was not as chewy as I like but not soggy in the soup. I like the garlic soup, very flavourful, the best part of the bowl. The pork was not bad, some fat on there but only 2 pieces. Probably because there was so many ppl waiting in line, they were very quick in clearing the table, so we didn't end up getting desserts as we felt like we were being rushed out."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago. Decided to try the Spicy Touhenboku Ramen. Not bad, but it was too oily for me. Service was decent. Compared to the other choices in Toronto, this joint is mediocre in my books."}
{"text":"I am a chicken Ramen lover and this is hands down my favourite place for Ramen in Toronto. Every time I crave ramen it's Touhenboku's that I want. My go-to is: Thick noodles, Sea salt, chicken broth/ meat, and Spicy red. The service is friendly; the flavour is simple, and I almost want to say delicate, compared to other ramen I have tried around Toronto. As a regular customer, I truly appreciate the consistent flavours I get every time.  Although they have a fairly small menu it's great to see a vegetarian ramen option available as well.  The only downsides I've ever experienced are having to wait in line during busy hours, once or twice, at the Queen location (Nothing new for good food!). Also, the spicy option is not spicy at all in my opinion. If that's a big deal for you then this ramen might not be to your liking.  My only suggestions: bring your ENTIRE appetite and try the \"Yakitori Don\" too if you can!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with some friends, and it really hit the spot!  I love that there's no line up and that the seating is spacious (unlike most of the ramen hotspots in Toronto).  The Good: We were in the middle of ordering when a little something caught me eye...a STUDENT SPECIAL! Could it be? With a little gasp (#nochill), I asked the server, and she was kind enough to tell us that we qualified for it as long as we showed her our student cards. The deal was a bowl of ramen and a glass of pop (a glass! a glass! it was adorable - everything tastes better from a class), for $10.95. Totally worth it? I think so.  The ramen was pretty affordable, and I love how you can customize it with the kind of meat cut, noodle thickness, and broth that you'd like (chicken or pork, with pork costing a few cents extra.) It also arrived in good time.  The Bad: I ordered the ramen with spicy chilli oil and pork broth, but was disappointed at how not very spicy it was. Was the ramen still delicious? Absolutely, but after the first few bites, it begins to taste a little lackluster. I couldn't help but compare it to Sansotei's Spicy Tan Tan, which I think is much more flavourful, and which has more depth than Touhenboku's does. However, my dear friend Lisa ordered the ramen with garlic, and that was bursting with flavour!  The Ugly: Although this wasn't a deal-breaker, I asked if I could substitute my pork belly with corn (because I don't eat pork belly, and I knew it would go to waste if I didn't eat it.)  The server said no, I couldn't and that it would be an extra charge. This didn't make much sense to me, because from a cost perspective, corn is a lot cheaper than pork belly, and technically I wasn't asking for something more expensive? I don't think it would have been too troublesome to make that simple swap, but it was, and I ended up just giving the pork belly in my ramen to a friend who enjoyed it more than I did. Just a heads up that they're not very flexible with substitutions here (but I do it at other ramen places like Sansotei all the time, no problem!)  Bottom line: Go here for a reliable ramen fix that's affordable, and with great service. Although it's not the best in the city, it's still pretty great. I'll definitely be Touhen..BACKu!"}
{"text":"I was walking home from work in the cold, and just when I thought to myself \"Man a bowl of hot noodles would be so good right now\"... BAM! Touhenboku appeared!   There was a small line when I went in but I didn't have to wait too long (table for one, duhhh). Service was quite good and fast in general, the food, on the other hand, was just so so.   I got the garlic meatlover with thick noodles. The broth was super garlicky, which I didn't mind. The noodle had a nice chewy texture, but not as good as sansotei's noodle. The soft and melt-in-your-mouth pork chashu was probably the highlight of my meal. My biggest complaint is that the soup is wayyyyy too salty! I had to down a whole bottle of water afterwards. Also the portion was quite small. I mean it was enough for me, but I'm notorious for eating like a sparrow so that's not saying much.   It has a super convenient location (for me anyway) so I'm pretty sure I'll visit again in one of the many cold winter nights to come!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place before it opened, and I was really excited to try this place. Maybe I hyped myself up and had a unrealistically high expectation. My friends and I went the first week they opened on a weekday around 5pm, the place was practically empty when we first got there. We wanted a table for 3, but all their tables were in pairs so they asked us to wait. 40 minutes later, and numerous couples sat down, they still couldn't figure out how to put two tables together. That alone put a damper on the experience, showing incompetency on their wait staff.  After we sat down, after 50 min wait, we were starving. I wanted to get double meat with chicken and pork but they didn't have chicken that day (so the first week of opening they don't have half of their menu basically).  I ordered the spicy ramen with double pork. The pork was mediocre, the egg was over boiled, the broth was way too oily, too salty and too thick, and I didn't taste the spicy at all. the only thing I was impressed with is the noodles, which were chewy and just right.  Their service during dinner was below average at most. We all ordered the same thing and they forgot the egg in my friend's bowl.  I was extremely disappointed. Will not come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I (group of 5) went to this place last night. The place is small, roughly seats 20 people, with 4 of those seats at the bar -- not that good for big groups especially during peak hours. There was no line of people waiting to be seated when we came in. Luckily, the wait wasn't long since a group of 3 was leaving and we were seated within 10 minutes. Our order came within 15 minutes. I had the spicy pork and miso broth with thin noodles and pork shoulder. It was pretty good. There was an extra charge for pork broth and extra for miso but it was worth it. It had a rich taste that stuck to the noodles. The spicy component wasn't too spicy, just a zing and doesn't linger. The noodles were just right, not too soft, not firm. I like to order thin noodles to trap flavor in between. Sadly, it only came with one piece of meat. Had I known that, I would've ordered an extra piece. Over all a good experience and good food! I would go again."}
{"text":"Excellent. Bon d'abord, j'ai agacé le gérant en laissant apparaître l'appli Yelp sur mon iPhone quand nous nous sommes assis. Celui est particulièrement navré par la pondération exagérée des commentaires émis par des clients insatisfaits par le temps d'attente ou que sais-je encore. Désolé l'ami, je ne voulais pas agacer ni énerver.   Le repas ? Exquis, des soupes faites maison, un choix de nouilles, de saveurs sur un menu très facile à lire. Je dois dire que j'ai été agréablement surpris par l'excellente qualité de la préparation. Nous y retournerons à coup sûr et les téléphones resteront dans la poche. Promis !"}
{"text":"I came here on the past Friday.  Our waiter was very friendly and the food came pretty quickly. Though I was here by 5:45, so before the dinner rush.  I ordered was \"Black\" (extra garlic), soy sauce, pork belly and thick noodles.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  I don't usually get soy sauce, so my soup base tasted a little strong of salt and maybe the garlic made it taste a little burnt.  My friend had the \"White\" with sea salt and that reminded me of creamy chicken noodle soup.  I heard that Touhenboku was chicken broth based.  It is still pretty creamy, so if you're looking for a clear base, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for you.  I enjoyed it overall and the seating was comfortable. I also liked that I got a full egg with my ramen.  I also shared a dessert with my friend Mille Crêpes.  I liked this, it's different but smooth."}
{"text":"Last time I went the food was exceptional, however my second visit it was horrendous. The ramen looked like it was instant noodles, literally. The toppings, egg, and meat were soaked in the soup, therefore presentation was a definite 0. The portion of the noodles and toppings were very small, definitely not worth the price of 10.50. The rice bowls were better than the ramen overall. Won't be coming back. Don't think it's worth the price. It's too bad, I really liked this place initially. Will have to settle somewhere else. The waiter/waitress were very nice, however."}
{"text":"First time going there due to recommendations of a friend and I most say, I absolutely loved it. I normally don't like ramen, as the taste and the thick noodles never sat well with me. However, this place has amazed me so much that I can't wait to go back again. The restaurant itself is not so big and it could be easily missed. So be ready to look carefully when walk by it. The restaurant has a friendly atmosphere and waitress are very professional and courtious. The food was prepared and served very quick(less than 10 minutes) that I didnt even feel the time. Since it was my first time there, I went with original flavor , which is \"White ramen\". I have also picked Chicken for meat choice and miso soup for soup flavor. There's also choice for noodle style(thin, thick) which is great as well. The serving size is reasonably big and it will take a while to finish. The price is also reasonable and definitely worth for what you're getting.    I will recommend this place and will definitely go back again... I can say with confidence, that this place has now become one of my all time favorite restaurants.   (Note- I took the ttc, as its really close to Osgood station. It's litaraly 2 minutes walk. There's not much options for parking if you drive, so you might have to park your car somewhere else and walk.)"}
{"text":"Great gem in the Yonge and eglinton area! Tried this place with a friend. I wanted to have ramen and it was a toss up between Kinton (which was around the corner and can never go wrong) or this new place. We decided on trying a new place and I'm so glad we did!   The spicy (red) thin ramen noodle with pork belly was spot on!! The unique chicken broth (instead of the more popular and usual pork based broth) was super tasty, slightly smokey, lighter tasting and not overly salty. The pork belly char siu was thinly sliced , similar to the hot pot type, instead of a thick slab that you may get from other ramen restaurants. But it was still good. Haha, I usually forget if I like the thick or thin noodle, but definitely order the thin! It's got a great bounce and texture to every bite. Moreover they make their own noodles in house! I loved whatever combination they had in the spicy red noodle set!! So good!!! If you like spicy of for it!! It's not tooooo spicy and it has Just the Right level of spice and taste!!! your taste buds will thank you hehe :)   My friend ordered the black garlic noodle set. The broth was tasty, thick and rich in garlic flavour. MmmmMmmmMmmmmmm. When you order the extra meat option, there is more variety with pork belly and pork shoulder. I'd also recommend a thin noodle with this one. Given that my friend finished this in minutes and was debating drinking the soup after, I can confidently say this dish was super tasty!   We also ordered a fried chicken don. The fried chicken was not very crispy and could not compare to the amazing ramen. I would order a different one next time.   Overall, I was impressed by food quality at Touhenboku ! Ambiance was great and was not overly loud or crowded. I loved how there are bottles and bottles of liquor (sake in this case) decorating the walls. :) I would definitely go back here again when I'm in the area! Loved it! :))"}
{"text":"Their house made noodles in their red/white/light or garlic ramen broth are definitely worth a try if you're a ramen fan.  You can choose to have thin or thick noodles, and soy based or sea salt based broth.  I always go for the thin noodles in sea salt based as I don't want the ramen to get too rich.  Their karange don (fried chicken & rice) delicious even though it's super simple.  For dessert, try their Tomo Creampuff, a crispy choux puff with whipped cream & custard!   Awesome location too - just a few minute walk from Osgoode station,"}
{"text":"Hearty food and friendly staff!  Tried this place for lunch the other day and it was great! I had the lunch special of garlic shoyu (soy sauce) ramen with pork shoulder, as well as a bowl of karaage (fried chicken on rice).  The ramen was tasty and filling, and everything was well cooked. The soup was a little on the salty side, but nothing overwhelming.   The karaage was great! The orange mayonnaise they drizzle on it was delicious and the chicken was well cooked. Only minor flaw was that the breading was not as crispy as I'd usually like it, but the flavour was definitely there.  I will definitely be returning soon - for $15 for a 2-part lunch, it was more than worth it!"}
{"text":"Cute little midtown ramen joint; the ambiance is casual but chic and sound level-wise it was nice and quiet during a weekend lunch.  We got there around 11:40am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all.  We were there til about 1:30pm and at no point did any guests have to wait for a table.    The menu is pretty simple - they have some apps, desserts, and of course a few varieties of ramen.  You get to choose the broth, the seasoning, the noodles (thick or thin), and what kind of chashu (meat) you want.    We ordered the chicken karaage to share and for $5.50 it's a pretty good deal - I think there were about 6 pieces of big chicken in the dish.  The batter is nice and crunchy (without being too oily) and the chicken was so moist.    I got their original ramen; the broth was quite tasty - not too salty nor oily, but I would have preferred the broth to be piping hot; the yolk of the egg definitely was not \"runny\" enough; the chashu was nice and tender without being too fatty (though I wish it came with more than just 1 slice); and the noodles were cooked well - soft without being gummy.  For dessert I ordered their mille crêpe - the menu said it came with a fruit glaze but I couldn't really taste it; each crêpe layer was super thin; overall the cake wasn't too sweet and a great end to the meal.  Overall a solid ramen joint - but not something I'd go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * Open for lunch and dinner * Dessert avail * Lunch special  So it is that time again, it's getting cold in Toronto and I found myself craving bowl of hot ramen. Starting with Kinton back in the day, I can't even keep track of how many more ramen places have opened up afterwards. A lot of them opened over summer time where I don't crave ramen at all, so they all kind of went under my radar. But since Touhenboku just recently opened up, I decided to drop by and give it a try.  I dropped by on a weekday around 6:30PM to find the restaurant packed, there was even line up inside the restaurant. I was given a number and the wait was going to be around 15 minutes.  We were offered cup of hot tea while we waited for our seats, I didn't drink it but I thought it was a nice gesture.  After a short wait, we were seated by the bar right beside where all the ramen action was happening.  Interesting thing about Touhenboku is that they use chicken broth instead of traditional pork broth. But don't worry, you still get those fatty goodness of Chashu on top.  You can choose from White (Original), Red (Spicy), Black (Garlicky) and Light Ramen- as well as choice of lean pork, rich pork or chicken chashu.  The noodles are made from their own blend of flour and you can choose either thick or thin noodles.  Ordered: Original Touhenboku Ramen (White) with thin noodles and fatty pork for $10.50. This is a straight forward ramen in a rich creamy chicken broth flavored with sea salt or soya sauce (I went with salt based soup). First of all, I found the soup to be really oily. You would think that since it is chicken broth, it would be more clear and less fatty- but it was a lot oilier than the usual pork broth I was used to. There was no way I was drinking the soup so I was disappoined with that. Also, I was told their thick noodles are quite doughy so that's why I went with the thin noodles. However, I found the thin noodles to be very doughy as well. And as time passed by, ramen noodles were soaking up the chicken broth so fast that it became thicker, doughier and overall really slimy. Near the end I had to shove all the ramen in my mouth because I felt like if I let it sit anymore in my bowl, it would've turned into slimy udon.   Ordered: Spicy Touhenboku Ramen (Red) with thin noodles and lean pork for $10.50. This is original touhenboku ramen with a kick, incorporated with their special chili oil.  Ordered: Karaage Don for $4.50, we ordered this as a side and it was what it is. Nothing spectacular and nothing to write about. Both rice and karaage was cold and it was overall very dry.  Summary: There are 2 keys to an awesome bowl of Ramen, and that is good ramen noodles and deep, rich broth. Perhaps it is a personal preference but I like ramen noodles that are bouncier with more of a texture and a broth that's not too oily that I can sip on. My favorite ramen spot is still Sansotei, I miss their Tonkotsu Ramen!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Vegetarian Miso Ramen. The vibe is really cool and laid back. It is clean and has a nice lunch crowd. The servers were attentive and polite. I think that I will visit here when I come here. I looked at a few other ramen spots but this one seemed to be the right one for me!"}
{"text":"I saw tohenboku by accident walking by a few years ago and decided to stop in, and now its a regular thing for me. I love the soup broth its very creamy. The home made noodles i think are the real winners here, they taste amazing,  and having the option for thick or thin is terrific~  I often get the red spicy ramen with pork belly and extra noodles~ With a nice glass of Asahi, i really love this place."}
{"text":"I got a Cha-shu pork don. The menu didn't mention it what size they were. Even the sever did not.  The food came that I ordered, but it was SUPER small!! Unexpected!!! And then, the customer who was sitting beside me got one of ramens. He'd finished it within 5 minutes since it was served. I'm not sure how time he spent, but I guess between 5 minutes and 10 minutes. I'm sure they couldn't be we feel full with their dishes.. I was so disappointed..For me, the next time will never come.."}
{"text":"Just ordered on Foodora for the first time.  Overall food was great, but my ramen arrived with only 1 small piece of pork belly cut... I eat ramen at least once a week but never received only 1 piece like that from any of  the places I go to (kinton, sansotei etc). Kinda weird to be honest, not sure if it's a mistake or them just being cheap..."}
{"text":"Have been here for a week ago,  location is fine,  convenient nearby eglinton subway. And jus located on quiet section on yonge so that you can enjoy the silent.  Drink menu is manifold.  For the food, their size is always smaller, and what i hv tried was a black garlic ramen with chashu,  the garlic sauce is like jelly texture on the ramen surface,  not really look like a sauce.  The chashu has not meat favor or any juicy texture and it was hard to bite off, soup is simply with salty and not rich taste enough.  As i mentioned size just small,  i also tried the chashu donburi for side,  but its disappointed me again,  meat was very dried and hard,  didnt has taste and wad jus tasted the soy source favour but too salty.  I think this is not really good to put on rice.  By the way,  their presentation of foods are fine,  in shop interior is trendy, customer service is not bad, but the foods quality are always the core anyway. Hopefully there will get bettet soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic friendly sercice, and fantastic ramen!  We didn't have to wait long to get a seat, we went there around 8 pm.  The ramen was very fresh and extremely tastful! I can't remember the exact combo of what I got, but it was the chicken, and spicy base (not spicy at all, but good). I also got the takoyaki to go along with it, and those were very flavorful as well! Definitely recommend them (Hot heat wise in the middle, so be careful!)  I will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"Touhenboku deserves a star for their mascot standing out in the freezing cold, but honestly, I can make a tastier meal with my instant noodles at home.   I got the lunch combo (spicy broth ramen + karage don) for $14.00 - the portions were good for a girl, but probably not enough for a guy's appetite. My ramen came in a very thick soup that was extremely salty and NOT spicy at all. The \"ramen\" did not taste like \"ramen\", more like packaged noodles, similar to those used by Santouka. One piece of pork came with the ramen + one piece of seaweed. I had to keep chugging water for the rest of my day because of how salty the broth was.   The karage don was A-OK, the chicken was nice and tender, but was not crispy on the outside, so clearly not freshly fried. The rice was too soggy for Japanese rice, or maybe they overcooked it?   Service was extremely polite and friendly, but maybe a bit inattentive - we weren't given menus till I asked them for it.   Since it is their grand opening, they're giving out 10% off coupons when you get your bill. I'm not sure if I would return though, given the limited options in soup base, I'd stick to Kenzo, which has way more variety."}
{"text":"Staff is nice. The place is well designed ,  and the food is good. I didn't like the food so much,  but I can come here again. Worth the shot."}
{"text":"I love the \"black\" ramen and how it tastes like burnt garlic. I haven't had ramen like that anywhere else. The noodles are on the soft side, but taste fresh. The broth is super creamy and delicious. I got the soya sauce flavour and it didn't taste too salty, but like all ramen, I was a little thirsty afterwards. The amount of meat in the bowl was okay (maybe three pieces of pork belly) but would not be mistaken for a lot by any standards.  I like the decor of the place with the exposed brick and all-crystal chandeliers. Tables are close together but not communal and we still had enough elbow space that no one was encroaching on our table. Still not too big of a place though.  The restaurant was about half full on a weekday at 1pm. Service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Another example of a ramen house making sub par ramen. Cheap yes, taste yes, tastes like ramen should, absolutely not. The broth is certainly not a tonkotsu broth and tasted like repurposed chicken stock. The noodles were also not fresh and had a package taste to them. If you're going to use the word ramen in your name learn how to make ramen. And who puts giant onions in ramen??  The restaurant was clean and the service was decent   If you're looking for decent ramen this is definitely not the place"}
{"text":"I ordered a regular pork soup ramen with sea salt, thick noodles, and pork shoulder. The soup had a noticeable creamy texture with lots of flavour. It was different from other ramen places I've been to, so for me it took some time to appreciate it. The noodles had a good chew and there was enough to fill me up, which was nice. The ramen came with only one slice of pork shoulder, but it was thicker than other places so I guess it's alright. Overall I enjoyed my bowl of ramen. I wouldn't mind coming back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very delicious ramen place. Their original soup is absolutely amazing, this creamy chicken soup that I have no idea how they make but I don't care cause give me some more. I ordered thick noodles with pork belly and also some fried chicken. Good portion size, good price, very friendly service."}
{"text":"Setting the noodle making machine aside, Touhenboku's soup base is probably its most \"unique\" aspect when compared to its competitors. Rich and (perhaps a bit too) thick, the store touts a soup base packed with collagen that's less oily than the pork bone based soups of its competitors.   As great as it sounds, it is most likely the soup base that'll create a divergence of customer opinions. And yes, from this three star review, one can perhaps speculate (or not..) that this soup base was definitely not my cup of tea (..bowl of soup?).  Yesterday night, I had the Original Touhenboku ramen with thick noodles, regular pork, and in sea salt flavour. The noodles and pork were definitely solid. No complaints there. But after three spoons of the soup, I was taken back to a nightmare episode I had in Japan where I had tried this similar thick, rich, flavour packed soup that was so thick, rich, and flavourful, I swore off my beloved meat and all things oily for the next three months of my life. (no lie, srs)    This place is not bad. Really. It's worth giving this place a try, being one of the rare places in Toronto that actually serve this type of \"pai-tan\" soup. But for me at least, I probably won't be going there for awhile."}
{"text":"Solid place.  Spicy ramen and fried chicken were pretty good but the service was great!  Very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"The service and ramen here is excellent. I don't know why this restaurant doesn't have a higher review.  Parking is a struggle here if you do come here by car!  Other than that, the food and service is wonderful. The servers go that extra mile to make sure you have a great dining experience.  Interior is very small. Fits probably only 20 people and is a bit tight.   The Raman and chicken Katsu was one of the best I have ever had in toronto.  Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Ramen is fast food in Japan, cooked slowly.   From downtown Toronto to the far reaches of Scarborough takes just under forty minutes of local driving on a Sunday morning, in between that I had 1/2 hour to shove food in my face. Touhenboku opened their second location in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood. A bold effort riding off  of the momentum gained at their flagship location on Queen Street West. It is the only restaurant in the area that offers food served with reasonable expedience that isn't sh?warm?. Toronto is becoming sick of sh?warm?, ramen is our new drug. Sushi, sh?warm?, pork bone soup, burrito, and now ramen, this city is impressionable, but we seem be impressed by all the Dickensian things from other cultures.   Parking enforcement ignores the vehicles in this upper middle class neighbourhood on Sundays, because it pleases the baby strolling, electrolyte waist belt jogging white folks that has held claim to this area since business here began. Corruption here in Canada is slightly different than your average crony capitalist Country.  Chandeliers, wooden tiles, and brick walls, I suspect little renovation was needed for the second installment of what seems to be Toronto's first ramen chain. Horrible generic Japanese hotel lobby jazz music filled the humble ambiance. All of the tables were placed along the stretch of the walls, catering mostly to people who preferred to eat alone. An overly enthusiastic waitress sat me, clearly anxious about her new job at this restaurant that just opened, as it has yet to solidify their name in the restaurant competitive stretch of Yonge Street, near Eglinton Avenue. The menu is identical to the other location, and I ordered a regular ramen, salt based with chicken. I added a side of Touhenboku's rendition of fried chicken pieces on rice, covered in sweet mayonnaise.  I'm sad to say that the once almost gelatinous soup is now considerably thinner, the noodles less elastic in texture, and the chicken comes nowhere near to the pork. The soup base itself is chicken, as despite the descension in quality, was still rather good. The soft boil egg was slightly harder than desired, and that horrible jazz music persisted throughout the meal could make a stone cold Miles Davis cry.   The kitchen area was uncomfortably open concept, as I could see every shaving of vegetable hit the floor. A small bar area with wine glasses hanging from the ceiling fixture was the only sense of privacy between the patrons and the staff. A glass case by the stairway leading to the downstairs washroom housed large bottles of sake proudly on display. There was no art on the wall, but the art of sanitation in the form of certificates next to the framed accolades dated 2013 from some organization I never heard of. The whole place just didn't feel Japanese. I would much rather it be brushed steel and huge ventilation systems sucking up steam in a heavily crowded and busy hole in the wall instead. What is the point of maintaining a sophisticated atmosphere (which evidently didn't work out for the previous tenant) to serve such a simple dish? If I wanted sophistication, I could have easily gone to any of the one hundred other restaurants immediately beside/next to/adjacent to here and had myself a dish spelt with an apostrophe.   One redeeming factor was the wonderful and happy staff. If there is consistency to be found in this brand, it would be the employees who offer more respect than I could ever deserve. Japanese speaking people with Japanese mannerisms that spoil an American washed boy like me. Bless their pale skins and slightly misaligned teeth. I have always compared the Japanese among Asians as British among Westerners; people of impeccable attention to detail, superior etiquette and ingenuity, unwavering pride, and unfortunate dentistry."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, you can find free parking on the side streets . Food quality is very consistent so you can't really go wrong.  The ramen soup taste good and i'm a fan of the thick noodle. I tried the Chicken Karaage as well it comes with a mayo dip, it taste very juicy although I prefer my chicken crispier on the outside. I've yet to find a chicken Karaage that is a must order in Toronto.. maybe im too picky   The restaurant isn't very big so coming with a party of more then 4 might be a challenge during peak hours...this is nothing new for ramen shops However the service has been good, friendly staff.  I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Had their spicy broth with pork belly.  The noodles were perfectly al dente.  But the eggs are pre-made so I bit into cold yolk which wasn't enjoyable.  They also over-cooked the egg which didn't give me that yolk-y texture, which is why other ramen places (Santouka & Sansotei) are very popular.  And they only give you 1 piece of meat.  Overall not as good as other ramen places so I wouldn't recommend it to friends, but personally it's close by my office and their service is fast."}
{"text":"Love this place. The menu is so easy to follow with a step by step ordering. You can totally customize your ramen the ways you like. Fast service and good portion especially during lunch when you order the combo. A bowl of ramen and a bowl of meat over rice for such a good price."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning. Had ground pork special. Was soooo sick within a few hours. Stay away. I am traumatized, it's been 6 months and I still can't eat ramen."}
{"text":"ordered  1) thick noodle ramen with pork belly and spicy miso soup  2) fried chicken 3) gyoza   the ramen was excellent, thick pork bone broth (as good as Santouka) with appropriatly. chewy noodles. The pork belly is quite fatty but sooooo yummy   fried chicken was also nice and juicy. my husband thought it wasn't crispy enough but I would rather it be juicy rather than crispy and dry  the only disappointment was the gyoza. very overpriced and mundane"}
{"text":"I have been cooking Japanese ramen at home for the last month, or at least I thought I was until I came here. It turned out that I was just cooking Chinese noodles, as Touhenboku introduced my virgin palate to the taste of real Japanese ramen for the first time.  Angelina and I strolled down Queen Street in the rain like two tourists because she thought she saw the word 'ramen' while driving around trying to find parking. We asked a pedestrian, as if she was somehow able to recite the name of this place simply from memory. There's a mildly romanticized story on their website. I'm too lazy to recite it here.  The estate is only slightly larger than your average hole in the wall, but it has been renovated down to the teeth. The sparkling tile/marble wall set a unexplainable ambiance, contrasting the rest of the restaurant which was had a post modern decor which in comparison was very boring. The restaurant had about seven  to eight tables, five to six of them sits only two. In proper Japanese fashion; there are bar seats for single diners. In anything but proper Japanese fashion; there is a Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 1 pumping out quality jazz music. Angelina asked me what Bang & Olufsen was, and as I began to explain to her how it was far more superior to BOSE, she began to question my knowledge with luxury electronics. She was unable to search it up online because she didn't have her modern woman smartphone. I proceeded to explain the superior quality of sound using technical jargon, and the more I spoke the more skeptical she became. Eventually, I stopped explaining and just starting cursing profanities under my breath.   First came the korokke. I never had creamier potatoes in my life. I immediately regretted ordering this dish with Angelina. I should have just ordered it myself.  Then came my spicy ramen with soy sauce base. Black earwood fungus and seaweed garnished the bowl, with a soft boiled egg marinated in soy sauce complimented the noodle and broth. I tasted the broth first. The flavours insulted my ever effort to replicate at home a dish I never tried. This bowl of ramen was so delicious I almost wanted to just give up cooking altogether. The broth was thick, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  What happened? Ramen was a Chinese invention. How could the Japanese exceed my people with our own invention. Is this what real ramen tasted like in Japan? This is unbelievable! All conversation came to a halt, my interests narrowed to only the food in front of me. Then came the Kara-age Don. Basically it is diced fried chicken on rice. Not so basically, it was the most tender chicken I have ever had.  Then and there, I decided to take some time out in the near future and come back to try the entire menu. This was one of the best culinary experiences I've had in Canada. Maybe it's the cooking, maybe I just came here on a good night. Maybe because the waitress was cute. Maybe it's because Bang & Olufsen is unequivocally better than BOSE. I don't want to finish this sentence.  For a small charge, a second serving of noodles can be added to whatever is left of your broth. The broth is served with a choice of having sea salt (or as I like to call it: Salt), or soy sauce. The side orders are cheaper when it is ordered as side dishes.  The place opens until midnight on weekdays.  Thank goodness.  I will never again try to cook Japanese ramen on my own again."}
{"text":"The ramen was not really that good. The soup was really frothy and lacked a lot of flavour. It's like they boiled water then served it (exaggeration but kind of paint the picture)."}
{"text":"This place is in my top three ramen places in the city. I usually get the white original ramen with chicken, thick noodles, and soy sauce for $10.50. Extra noodles are only a dollar. It's very filling and addictive. They also have a membership card you have to earn by buying different things on the menu, which will grant you access to their secret menu. They often have a line up so go early!"}
{"text":"Came in before 2pm and got seated quickly.  I already knew what to order.  White original, chicken broth, sea salt, thin noodles and chashu chicken.  It took no more than 5 minutes to get the ramen plus an order of chashu pork donburi!  Alarm bells.  Broth was piping hot and rich.  Noodles were good but not as good as Kinton.  Chashu chicken was disappointing.  Dry!  So was the chashu pork with rice.  Was the meat already cooked earlier and just sat under a heat lamp?  Tip and taxes came up to just over $20.  I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I have eaten ramen here 6 times. I did not like the broth much at first. I love ramen though so I went back simply because there is no other ramen options in the area. The next couple of times I had reasonable expectations so I found it to be fine.  I will not be going back though. Reason? I have been terribly sick 2 out of the last 3 times I ate here. 2 days of diarrhea is not worth average ramen. Even for a ramen lover."}
{"text":"Fast service, fresh food tasted good. We tried spicy, soy sauce, shoulder pork with thin ramen and the chashu pork Don; both were flavourful. I really liked the amount of spice. We also enjoyed edaname, but asked for less salt. They were good too. The tea was Sloane tropical green, nice and light. We would eat here again.  They kept our water and tea filled and were quick when we wanted the bill."}
{"text":"Food here is overly salty. The service is quick, and the food was served in a reasonable amount of time, however for what the meal is (literally instant noodles...) it's expensive.   Also, I know it's a custom to greet and say goodbye in these kinds of restaurants - but hearing it every couple minutes gets on my nerves. Not an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Lunch. Taste:3/5 Service/Value:3.5/5 Repeat: no"}
{"text":"I remember the sushi craze from years ago. The more popular sushi became, the more sushi restaurants opened up, and inevitably the lower the overall quality standard of sushi in the city. It seems the recent popularity of ramen is headed towards that same fate. At least, one would think so after dining at Touhenboku Ramen.   First the atmosphere: It's pleasant with a modern decor not unlike many of the newer ramen restaurants. The staff are pleasant and attentive. No complaints so far. They offer not just ramen but Japanese rice dishes as well. The Ramen varieties are all pretty much there own style as oppose to stated regional variations like Sapporo or  Hokkaido. I went with \"Red\" their spicy edition. Options included soy or sea salt broth base, thin or thick noodle and a choice of meat. I decided upon sea salt, thin noodle and lean pork.    The ramen came and the first thing I notice was that it was not as hot temperature-wise as I am accustomed to getting. Digging in to the bowl I found the noodles, which upon taste I associated more with that of spaghetti than ramen, were a tad undercooked and rather bland overall. The meat seemed rather...Like it had been prepared many, many hours ago and had been kept on standby since. Not that flavourful. The mushrooms tasted rubbery at best. As for the broth it was on the thick side and immensely salty, too salty now that I think of it. I couldn't even finish the bowl. Spicy enough though.   Overall I found my experience at Touhenboku to be regrettable. At best the ramen here is just a few notches above what you can make at home with packaged noodles. $5 a bowl I'd give it 3 stars but at $10.50 2 stars at best. I wish I had ordered one of the rice dishes as the table next to me seemed to enjoying that much more than I and my ramen.  For ramen lovers, give this place a pass. You can do so much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time visit.  We had an exceptional welcome. While we were waiting for our table,  Zuimei gave us the green tea with peach.  It was a comfort tea and also a keychain for souvenir as a treat for the waiting time.  Thank you so much. Food is very very good.  Service is excellent.  For sure  will go again cuz still a lot of things to try."}
{"text":"2.5 really.  i liked the place, i liked the service, unfortunately the ramen broth didn't seem right.  my friend says they used chicken broth while to me it seemed like it was unnaturally thickened with cornstarch or something. I've noticed that the hakata style ramen that I do like tend to have tiny bits of marrow or fat floating around in the broth.  The noodles were alright, chashu was average, prices ok. Overall, I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, still had to wait for 15 mins at 2pm.  The menus are clean with lots of big pictures, which I always love!  They offer 4 choices of Ramen with your choice of meat, thin/thick noodles and soy/salt based broth.  My friends wanted to try out this place because they read somewhere they use a $40,000 Ramen making machine.  I couldn't see a difference in quality over other Ramen places though.  But their broth was delicious, the base was thick and flavourable.  It's a bit heavy on salt though which leaves you keep downing the glasses of water.   Overall, it's a nice place and the service was friendly and fast.  They even do separate bills without hesitation.   Note - If you sit near the doors during the winter, their double door layout sucks and still brings in lots of cold wind.  You'll end up wearing your jacket like we did."}
{"text":"I love ramen so it's hard to go wrong here. Dishes are good and simple but there's also a decent selection of items you can add. Huge bonus points for having both Sapporo and Asahi on tap. It was delicious but the waitresses ignored us for twenty minutes when we were done our food (and drinks) and just wanted to get our bill and move on. All in all great spot though!"}
{"text":"Great service but uninspired ramen for anyone that has any standard for the product. The egg was over cooked and the broth was thin. Lots of other quality ramen elsewhere if you can travel out of the area."}
{"text":"A solid bowl of ramen. Loved the thin noodles as it was able to latch on to the soup. Soup broth was flavourful but more on the lighter side compared to other ramen joints. Chicken karaage was very juicy, but the outer shell was soft and moist, it lost the crunch.   Overall a solid ramen meal for the price."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen places in the city!! Salt broth is my fave type of broth, perfectly cooked noodles as well. Chicken Karaage is also delicious!!"}
{"text":"This spot was more of a 3.5 stars, really. I'm just starting to get into ramen and was excited to try another location when I came across this restaurant. The space inside is quite small, but I like the atmosphere. The exposed brick and somewhat open kitchen give it a cozy feel, and the servers I interacted with were both friendly.  My friends and I started with the takoyaki (fried octopus balls) before moving onto our ramen bowls. The appetizer was nice and perfect to split between three people (2 balls each!). I ordered the vegetarian ramen with thick noodles (you can choose between thick and thin) and two extra toppings (corn and bamboo) for an additional $2. I was really happy with the cook of the noodles as well as the size. I can't imagine the thin noodles being better, but you never know. The vegetarian ramen comes with beansprouts, mushroom, seaweed, and a soft boiled egg. The toppings were all great but the one that stood out for me was the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg! The only letdown was the broth, which should really be the star of the show. I felt it was lacking in flavour. There are different broths available and I feel like the others would probably have fared better with me. I went with the classic miso broth but I would definitely like to come back and try the garlic or spicy broth next time!"}
{"text":"One of my great passions in life is ramen. I've made it one of my soft goals to try every ramen place I can, at least once. Touhenboku marks the first one I've encountered in Toronto, unfortunately it just kind of hits the middle of the mark for me. Props to the restaurant for having one of the cutest logos ever though, a ramen bowl on a tree stump? Yes please.  Like many other ramen places, they give you a range of things you can customized - noodles, soup, and type of meat. I went with Red (spicy), with Pork soup (extra $1), Soya sauce seasoning, thick noodles and pork belly for meat. This wasn't anywhere near the worst ramen I've had, but it's definitely far from a standout. The ramen wasn't very memorable. The broth, with a soy sauce and pork broth, it should be richer in texture and flavour, but I find it rather run of the mill. The noodles were well-cooked and the meat was pretty average. The Red broth wasn't really spicy, which is something I usually like in my ramen, just a touch of spice, but that might just be my personal palette, so I won't let that cloud my judgement too much.  Service was really average. It took us a little while to flag down a waiter to pay, which is something I always find strange. As I mentioned above, this ramen is just extremely average, and I'm sure there are better options in the city."}
{"text":"I'm a huge ramen eating fan and I like trying new places but this place is just: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  For my first visit, I ordered the takoyaki and pork white ramen with thick noodles, soya sauce soup base, and pork belly. The takoyaki was just alright as it was not spectacular nor it was terrible. The pork white ramen was the real problem. The pork belly that they gave you was thinly sliced and lacked favour. The soup base was very salty. I was drinking a lot of water and had to get a refills as well. The egg was disappointing compared to other ramen place as it was cooked right through. I also don't really get why they charge $0.50 more for the miso base soup.  The second time I visited I came here for lunch since I had an event that I needed to attend to nearby. I didn't think that a lunch combo (Karrage don and pork white ramen) would cost so much around $20 after tax and tip for a bowl of ramen and a rice bowl. I thought it was not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst food experiences I've ever had. Not just worst ramen, but worst food in general. I got the \"light\" broth, and it was basically a bowl of oil. It was so oily it was inedible. I ate the eggs and left everything else. The combo came with dessert, the Millie crepe. I asked for it to go because I wanted to leave asap. At home I open the container, and it's the tiniest portion ever, and it was gross too. There's WAAAY better ramen shops in Toronto."}
{"text":"Touhenboku Ramen is probably the only Ramen place I been to that I was totally unsatsifed with.  We got the white and the red Ramen and both the soup base was super thick and salty.  The ramen noodles were terrible (thin) like it was out of a package. You get to pick from thick or thin noodles, chicken, lean pork and pork belly & seas salt or soya sauce for your soup.  You get half an egg with each ramen as well like most places. Don't think I will be returning here for another bowl of Ramen.  On top of that theie service was great as they had more workers than tables there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Their rice bowls are very good and a good option for a light lunch, children and picky eaters. It would be better if they create some side options: salads or steam vegetables.   They have very friendly staff. The only disadvantage is the place is really tight. They've crowded the place with too much seating, not enough space."}
{"text":"Decided to give Touhenboku a try one weeknight. It's a relatively small restaurant (as with most ramen places) but we still managed to grab a table for two. My boyfriend got the black garlicy ramen and I had the karaage don. The ramen tasted okay - but we've definitely had better. The karaage don was decent but be warned that it comes in a very small bowl and on its own would definitely not be filling enough for either lunch or dinner. Overall for the prices they charge, we found their portions to be incredibly underwhelming and likely won't be revisiting any time soon."}
{"text":"Ordered black ramen with pork. The egg is a bit overcooked, and only one piece of pork chashu are definitely not satisfying. The portion is not that big to be honest and the price is a bit too high. It's not a bad ramen restaurant, but definitely being outclassed by Sansotei as well as all other counterparts in Vancouver. The only advantage is its location."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered a white ramen combo with a cha-shu don. Really enjoyed the cha-shu don, especially the japanese mayo that is swirled on top of it! In fact I actually think that I enjoyed the don more so than I like the ramen. That being said I think that Touhenboku does the best chicken broth ramen I've had so far. My personal ramen favourite overall is still Sansotei, but it is an unfair comparison between the two since Sansotei broth is pork based, which I have a strong bias towards. I actually usually strongly dislike chicken broth, but at first taste at Touhenboku I thought it was quite good!  It is important to note though that the ramen and don combo is indeed extremely filling. Although I usually have a big appetite I couldn't finish everything because I wasn't feeling very well that day. But overall I did enjoy the simplicity of the menu and the quality of the food. Service was also excellent, as with most Japanese run establishments. You can follow them on twitter and ask what the daily twitter special is! The day that I went the special was an extra topping for free which I didn't get cause that would truly have been too much. I wasn't too happy with the egg that came with it though. Not flavourful enough and not soft boiled like I like it. Overall though it was definitely a nice experience and I intend to come back for dessert and/or the ramen beer combo!  TIP: If you're not too crazy about ramen I would recommend just getting a don ($4) and then trying out their desserts! They have mille crepes and all that jazz."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Touhenboku, starting from the Queen St. location. They make their own ramen (at Queen St), so you can really taste the love and distinct character of the noodles. The broth is amazingly rich. i always get the RED spicy ramen, and love that they include a full soft-boiled egg, mushrooms (a nice touch!) and green onions.  On top of the food, the servers are always friendly. And their mascot is the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I had the black meatlover ramen and takoyaki and I was very satisfied with the quality of what I got, especially since the price is not that steep.  The service was very good, they helped us out with the best options when choosing the ramen."}
{"text":"Service is great but the Ramen is way too greasy. I literally see a thick layer of oil in the bowl couple of minutes after I put my chopstick down.  The Pork is too fat as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now just to give them a fair shake.  It's good, but not the best.  The soups are quite tasty, each with a unique flavour.  The first time we came, the broth was so thick, it was almost gelatinous.  Weird.  The second time was much better.  I like that you can choose the thickness of the noodle.  I've only had thin. Very good, friendly service.    Tip: if you don't like your food too salty, ask for less salt and it makes a huge difference!"}
{"text":"This place makes comforting, simple and tasty food.   I've been here twice and also had take out, which was packed with care. Their service is also polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch in the late afternoon and was seated right away. I'm not a fan of chicken broth so I ordered the pork broth black garlicky ramen (additional $1 for pork instead of chicken). Wasn't happy about the extra cost for pork broth but thought I'd give it a try anyways. Portion is small and the broth is too bland and just warm. only good thing about this place is service, but otherwise wouldn't come here again even to satisfy my ramen craving."}
{"text":"Awesome Ramen! We had the dinner combo that includes one appetizer, any ramen and a beer for $19.00. Red ramen broth is spicy, hot and creamy with just the right amount of pork and noodles. Potato croquettes were delicious and a beer to wash it down was the perfect little dinner. Although not so little. It was definitely filling. I'd go back again any time!"}
{"text":"I really loved the ramen here. I've tried Kinton twice and find their both lacking in flavour and depth and their decor too gimmicky for me. Strangely, everyone seems to love it there. As i sauntered down Queen Street this rainy March afternoon I was craving a warm bowl of comforting noodles and Touhenboku delivered.  I had the Pork Shoulder with Red Broth and Thin noodles and a large Asahi. I received a wonderful hot bowl of spicy, creamy broth that packed a punch without all the garlic and soy that many other places use to flavour their ramen. Noodles were perfectly tender and the egg was wonderful. Washed down with a beer, it was the perfect rainy day sojourn to warm the soul.  Service was also wonderful. It was quite slow when i went, but my server was funny and attentive without interrupting my antisocial pouring over of the latest Now Magazine."}
{"text":"Checked another one off the list in the new ramen spots sprouting up around Toronto.  I've tried just about all the ramen restos in the city, and Touhenboku fits in the middle of the pack.  I had the spicey ramen which had a good kick.  The broth was thick and tasty, but a too oily.  You are able to choose seasoning with sea-salt or soya and between thick or thin noodles (definitely go for the thin).  I will say their broth has a unique taste that does set them apart from other ramen shops.  Also had an order of the karage, which was done right.  The meal overall was good, but not great.  It was prepared with a \"hurried\" feel to it, as most ramen places make their money on constant turnover.  I'm really not sure how many of these restaurants will survive into 2014.  Maybe I'm not giving this place the stars it deserves, but it's hard to impress me with ramen.  Santouka, IMO, remains the ramen king in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's so unfortunate that we arrived at 11:20 and management turned away our entire group stating their establishment was closed and they had last call at 11:20  which was 40 mins prior to the hours presented. The open sign was still present in the window. It took 3 mins for us to get his attention to open the lock door. We asked for the manager he stated he was and wouldn't make the exception for the false advertisement. Please note this place doesn't close at the time advertised."}
{"text":"Great ramen place in mid-town Toronto. This area needed one.   My go-to is the red (spicy) ramen with pork belly & thick noodle, I'll have to try other types after seeing all the reviews here!   On the pricer side but overall a great place for some ramen fix!"}
{"text":"This place was easy to stop while walkimg down queen during my lunch. As i entered the place looked  like the averagr raman place; small, smell of ramen and asians everywhere :P. My girlfriend and i love ramen and i have never been here so i wanted to try it out.   I had a different experience than most other ramen places. You were able to choose what type of broth you wanted, the thickness of your noodles, what kind of meat you want, and if you want any extra toppings. I like the idea because you can play around with different options and try something new. I tried a spicy soy sauce broth with thin noodles with pork belly and an extra soft boiled egg. It was good...a little salty, but still delicious. It ended up being around $13 which is in my opinion a cheap yet satisfying lunch.  If you're working downtown or are just in the area and want to have some ramen, check this place out. You can be in and out in less than an hour. Service and quality I'd say is 4 stars. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quaint location with more than just Ramen. It's great they have new location that's a bit more convenient for those of us who don't live downtown. Ordered the white soup with sea salt and pork shoulder. Was a bit disappointed that there was only two piece of meat but they did give a whole egg. The noodles are definitely on the soft side. Not sure if I could ask them to make harder. The soup was quite creamy and have genuine pork bone taste and not like some artificial soup base some other places have.   I really like that they have other things in addition to the ramen like Izakaya style apps and dessert although I didn't have the appetite to try it this time. They have this layered crepe cake that looks delicious. The service was excellent and the decor was nice. Need to find street parking though. Had trouble logging onto wifi."}
{"text":"Having gone here for a handful of times, today I decided to be adventurous, and tried their new miso ramen with a One-Cup sake with karaage chicken. Have to say the sake complemented the ramen very well.   I had the \"red\"  flavor. Although not very spicy, it further accentuated the flavourful miso and sesame taste. The \"red\" tare, miso, and sesame oil all add additional layers of complexity to an already rich tastey broth bursting with umami. I'd have to say their miso ramen is their most delicious dish to date, with the strongest sesame taste I've ever had in any ramen in Toronto. If you like the taste of sesame, and rich flavorful ramen, then this is the dish to try."}
{"text":"Great service! We came for a super later dinner after attending an event -- around 10:30PM! Loved that they were open until midnight and the usual evening rush also passed so there were plenty of seats.   The waiter is incredibly polite and informative about the menu. Ordering was also easy and self explanatory -- soup base, seasoning, noodle thickness & protein.   I ordered the chicken broth with spicy seasoning. It could have been more spicy but the overall flavour was delicious! The noodles were fresh and you could tell they were made in house.   Great ramen place!"}
{"text":"I find that these ramen places get busy and the servers really rush you to finish. That's pretty much the only downside. The food was great, and the proportions were decent. I ordered the spicy ramen and asked for the chili sauce on the side ($13.45). My friend ordered a large Karaage Don which comes with a pop ($10.95). Servers were attentive, but once again, everything felt rushed and we felt like we had to always hurry. I would come again for their donburi dishes."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars to this place because I went there twice and I remember that I was relatively satisfied on my first visit. Too bad that I forgot that visit. And as my second visit was just Saturday.  I am going to talk about that one.  Well, you know what they say about \"If you don't have anything good to say then it's better not to say anything.\"  I am going to keep this short.  I am going to blame the lack of quality on how busy this place is.  I went to this place at the end of the lunch period at around 1:30.  I ordered the regular ramen and added extra noodles and soft boiled egg. The only good thing about this place is the option to get lean pork instead of the vessel clotting meat that the other joints shove down your throat.  I am sad to say that this place's noodle was either not actually done or just plain bad. It has that uncooked taste. And the 'soft' boiled egg is actually fully cooked.  I was quite disappointed by this experience.  As a result, I am taking away one more star."}
{"text":"Came across this one when I was jogging with my friends on Yonge st.. I've tried other \"famous\" ramen shops and was not impressed about going in for another ramen. To my surprise, the ramen i ordered which was orginal ramen with additional green onion turned out tk be a delight. It was light, yet flavourful with just the right portion. I haven't had the chance to try any appetizers, but I'll be sure to give them a try next time."}
{"text":"I have to admit... I actually don't love ramen in the traditional pork broth, or the pork that goes with it... which makes this joint's chicken broth base and chicken toppings so amazing for me! So far, this chicken ramen is only second to Momofuku's crispy version.   You have to try their fried chicken chunks too as a side. So good!"}
{"text":"Checking out the new ramen place: the wait was not too long, and service quite quick. The white chicken broth is absolutely delicious, and the thin noodles as well. But honestly, for all other ingredients, there are better places around."}
{"text":"Came here tonight. Decor was nice. I didn't leave as happy or as satisfied as I usually am when I leave Toukenboku. I am a regular of the Queen St location.   All but 3 of the tables were taken. One large group of 6-8 and the rest were tables of 2. Let's say there is approximately 10-12 tables in total. There were 3 servers, one of them was probably the busser.  Service was quiet slow - not as quick as the other location. The servers seemed really flustered but they were really friendly. Food came pretty slow but it was good (YUMMMM, karaage. Crepes were yummy as well). Our server kept forgetting to refill our water - we were so thirsty. We felt pretty ignored. They would walk by our table so many times but they never checked up on us.   Also, this is the first asian place I have ever been to that does not offer complimentary tea?! It's cold outside! $1.50 for a tiny cup of peach green tea?! No thanks.   I would probably stick to the Queen St location."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a regular. The Queen St West location is cute, clean and chic. The service is amazing. The servers are very attentive and friendly - 5 stars for customer service!  Ramen is always amazing. White and black bases are great. So is the red. Warning: the black does get a bit bitter towards the end.  Amazing desserts. Highly recommend the fried chicken (karaage - excuse the spelling) as an appetizer. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Well first and last time I step foot inside here, the management was very unhelpful and even took the situation to lightly. My friends and I were dining and one of them nearly chipped his tooth on a \"mushroom rock.\" servers description. When brought to the attention of the staff they seemed confused as nothing like that should be inside or around your food. The managers excuse was a slap in the face. \"Sometimes it happens they come with the mushrooms\" I've worked in the food industry its quality over quantity and this place is clearly the latter, he could've comped the meal to retain business. We got 10% off for nearly chipping a tooth. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I found the noodles to be very tasty, but the broth needs some work.  The first time, I tried the \"light\", but it tasted simply like chicken broth with no depth.  The second time I had the garlic, and the broth was very thick, a little too heavy and a little too salty.  If they could make the broth somewhere in between the 2 types, it would be perfect!  I had the lunch special with the rice and pork, that was very good!  They gave us tea without telling us what type it was and we were trying to guess what it was because it was so fragrant and sweet, and once the server told us it was a peach, we were able to recognize the lovely flavour.  And the servers are always so nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, great service, interesting decor. Their soup base is on the heavier side but rich in flavors. The idea of customizing your own ramen is nice (although thin and thick noodles are practically the same).   I'd recommend the pork belly ramen in original soup base (go for light if you don't enjoy a heavy base). We also had the takoyaki for appetizer, and a side order of chicken Donburi.   Overall this is a slightly above average ramen place. Would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Good value but quite average ramen.   Went here on Sunday night and it was quite crowded. We were seated right away and the service was very pleasant.   The menu is quite small and I believe the basic ramen starts at about $11 which is a bit cheaper than some of the other ramen restaurants nearby. I opted for the spicy touhenboku ramen (with the spicy sauce on the side) while my boyfriend ordered the black garlic ramen with extra pork belly.    We didn't wait long for the ramen to come out and aesthetically they looked great. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and there was plenty of toppings. The noodles were also not too soft and i liked that they had condiments on the side for quick customization. However, the broth was very bland... By no means is it bad tasting, but it definitely is much less flavorful in comparison to other restaurants. In my opinion, the heart of ramen is its broth, so I can't really give this place a better rating than 3.   Overall, good size and good looking ramen but bland."}
{"text":"Caught Disobedience at TIFF and wandered down Queen St for a bite to eat.  In the mood for Ramen so here we are.  Step 1 order the flavour (white, red, black, or light) Step 2 order the broth type (chicken or pork) Step 3 order the seasoning (soy, salt, or miso) Step 4 order thick or thin noodle  Step 5 meat choices Step 6 extras like more noodles, onion, etc.  It's a small busy place and we snagged the last table.  Ordered the black (garlic) base with pork broth, miso and thin noodles and of course gyoza.    Gyoza was a delicious light crispy pan fried wrapper enveloping a pork filling.  Yum!  The ramen was ok.  I found it a bit too salty but the flavours were good.  The pork belly wasn't quite melt in your tender but it was tasty as was the perfectly cooked runny (must be runny!) egg.    Service was friendly and quick.  Would come again if in the hood.  The entertainment was the couple sitting next to us. It was funny watching the girl try to eat her Ramen with one hand while holding her boyfriend's  hand with the other. Lol!"}
{"text":"We ordered the red flavored ramen with chicken broth, soya sauce, thin noodles, and pork belly. It was my first time eating at a Ramen shop and I have no complaint. We didn't wait too long for our food either. The staffs were also attentive and friendly.   Giving this a 4 star because someone ordered a second bowl, haha. I wouldn't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"Came here for a quite bite to eat on a Sunday afternoon.  I didnt want anything too big and they had Donburi (rice + meat) options for $6!  Perfect.  I got the fried chicken don (bowl of rice, freshly fried chicken with mayo on top and green onions; the rice had some tempura sauce on it so it wasn't plain tasting).  It was a decent amount of food for the price and the chicken was pretty good (bite-sized pieces, cut up and boneless)  My partner got a ramen bowl and said it was ok ($11.50). I'd come here again for the donburi.  Service was ok.  Four stars for food quality and value"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken broth pork belly ramen. The broth was really really thick and oily. The portion of the ramen is a bit small even to a lady. Its not bad if you are craving for ramen in the financial district during lunch time. But I wouldn't choose to go there to have food when I am off work."}
{"text":"Good service Bad ramen & broth - I ordered the 'Black' garlic broth with sea salt - OMG, it was so salty and I had to drink water all night. The ramen, made in-house, is nothing special, I ordered the thin ones. You are literally chewing on ramen.  As for the toppings, I had the fatty pork, and it comes with half and egg, bit of black fungus and that's it! We ordered extra ramen noodles for $0.50. The bowls everyone kept raving about is nothing special. And the portions are small.  As for dessert, I had the patachou, it was OK, pastry was dry and cream was good.  Having been to Sensotein & Santouka, Touhenboku is bad, and I will never return again.  I was there on a Friday night at 6 pm, no lineups outside and only half the seats were occupied. Not worth coming here IMO."}
{"text":"I love having myself some ramen, but the 2 times I've been here recently have both left me disappointed. Sure they have a great location and not a bad price, but Touhenboku made me wish I had spent time lining up at other more popular locations within a 10 minute walk from here.  For one thing it took 15 and 25 minutes for my order to get to me (and I had just ordered 1 dish) and I've actually been in and out of better ramen places in less than 25 minutes.   In terms of my satisfaction with the dishes, it was not for me. I see there are other yelpers who have enjoyed their food, so maybe this is just a personal preference, but I thought the taste lacked that flavour punch I look for in ramen. And the way they give the customer all the control is nice, but I would have preferred they have some basic ramen dishes ready to order in the menu with the option for me to customize.   They get the basics right, service is friendly and the place is clean, but after being left wanting more twice I don't see Touhenboku being my top choice for food in the area."}
{"text":"With so many ramen houses in Toronto, one really needs to be at least 4 stars to stand out. Unfortunately, they're one star short for me to go out my way to visit.   Their soup base with half the sea salt was fine. Full dosage of any one of the three (miso and soy sauce) would have been unbearably salty.   The soup base lack substance. The overbearing miso detracted from what a good soup base ought to be.   The noodles was just ok. Nothing amazing, but not that bad either (I've had worse, so it's well worth the 3 stars)."}
{"text":"A nice setting and good soup with a few different choices. I've been 3 times and tried something different each time. The service can vary a little. I do like the fact that they don't rush you out."}
{"text":"Before you start thinking..\"sigh, another one!?!?\"  Touhenboku has the distinction of being the newest kid on the block with the claim to fame being their super duper ramen making machine.  Is it enough to distinguish itself and steal some slurpy thunder from nearby Kinton and Santouka?  In short, YES!  Having a very small menu gives them the focus to do a few things well instead of trying to be all things to all people.    Soon to be famous are the  house made noodles. They are chewy and spongy in the right way.  Toppings though sparse are fresh and tasty.  The only disappointment about this place is that you have only one morsel of the juicy pork to enjoy - tastebuds ache for another slice (i ordered the 'rich' i.e. fattycut).  I slurped down a few spoonfuls of broth and found it to be rich and savoury.  The broth distinguishes itself for being made from chicken rather than pork and to my taste anyway, is better for it.  Lighter than the sometimes too fatty/heavy pork broth at other establishments, it comes to you piping hot and just salty enough.  As part of my set, i also had the karage rice bowl.  - a few nuggets of fried chicken, drizzled with a bit of Japanese mayo over a small bowl of rice was just enough of a capper to leave me very satisfied.      If you, like me are loathe to queue for an hour for a bowl of noodles, do drop in to Touhenboku now before the masses clue in.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is okay.  We only go there because it's the closest authentic ramen place to our work but Sansotei is better in terms of flavor and price.  I've tried the black garlic before and red spicy one."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday around noon time and it wasn't too busy. Service was warm and welcoming. I ordered a black ramen (garlic soup with salt base, regular pork and thick noodles), and a side order of karaage (fried chicken).   I liked the thick noodles. They were chewy. The soup broth was a little bit too think for my liking however it did taste rich and creamy and garlicky. The owner explained the thicknesses of the soup base was due to long hours simmering of chicken bones. The soup contained lots of collagen. (good for ladies!)  Next time I will try the clear soup broth, lighter version. I was glad that I didn't seem to taste MSG at all.   What I liked the most was the karaage. It was crispy yet very juicy inside and not greasy at all. I finished the pieces in lightning speed. Seriously I could eat one more order. Lol.   Those who are interested in Japanese dessert can visit the place after 3pm. I went there during lunch last time but they didn't have it ready. I will probably try the crepe next time as it looks very tasty.   I would give it 3.5 stars. Would visit again for other soup base."}
{"text":"Delicious!  And I like that the menu makes it so easy to decide. I chose the \"White\" which is the original ramen, with miso seasoning and chicken. Food was delivered very quickly."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  The extra .5 is because of the very zen ambiance; relaxing music, beautiful chandeliers, and wooden details that give you the impression that something nice is about to happen...  Fortunately the decoration matched the quality and flavour of the food.  I know that talking about the weather is small talk or used to \"fill\" awkward silences or situations, but today it is just necessary to complain  about him and his moodiness (we are having such a rainy and cold situation that they even canceled the Digital Dreams event.. WTF???). Where did the Spring went on vacations, and why is the Summer angry with us???  Ramen is the perfect lunch, dinner, or meal for one of this cloudy/feeling like doing nothing but cuddle kind of days. It recomforts you, it's fun to eat, it reminds you some of those Japanese cartoons you used to watch when kid, satisfies you, it's affordable, and it's elaboration requires so much dedication/time&effort, that you better buy&enjoy.  This place made the 2nd place in my about to write list of best ramen joints of Toronto. It was busy at 12:30, the attendants included several Japanese with their beautiful multicultural families. But when I really realized the food was good, was when a more than 70 years young senior Japanese fellow, ate his ramen and made a head approbating movement while eating.   The octopus appetizer had lots of dry fish flakes on the top, tasted like Spanish creamy croquetas, and were deliciously accompanied with green onion, mayo, and soy something sauce!!! I burnt my tongue, but it was worth.  Picking your ramen is didactic and the kids in the concurrence seemed to enjoy everything. Pick 1 of the flavours, pick 1 of the meat/vegetarian options, pick in between tick or thin noodles, and add extra items if you want.  I really liked this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten the black (garlic) ramen a couple of times and the flavour is consistently good. Unlike some other ramen places I've been to, the beer (I ordered a Sapporo) is actually cold here. You can even see them making the noodles on your way to the washroom."}
{"text":"I came here in April and forgot to write my review until now.  I had the combo which is a good deal.   I think I had rice with chicken., whatever it was on the menu that they called their specialty....it was ok so I wouldn't bother with the rice combo.    That day they had a limited # of vegetarian stock ramen.  I thought that was a plus.  I had the light broth (though I didn't order this...I really need to point which one I want).  It was good though and my sister had the spicy and ordered take out as well. She told me after trying 3 of the different stocks that the light was the best of the 3.     The noodles were a nice texture.  And if I'm in the neighbourhood again I'd come or try the eglinton location as that is where sis lives.     Pork is too lean though...doesn't give enough flavour without more fat on it.  Decent ramen...prices on par with everyone else I've been to."}
{"text":"As a ramen restaurant ,you guys should pay more attention on your dishes. The ramen I ate tonight is too NORMAL, the soup is under seasoning and too thick almost like sauce. The karaage don is basically just chicken popcorn with mayo and rice. Only the chicken balls are really good, bouncing texture and great mushroom sauce. Im a culinary student, my comment might be tough, but I really thing that as a new restaurant you guys should have a shining dish and do other dishes with heart, instead of showing 3 normal dishes that everyone can do and serve to customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the original with the chilli oil with chicken broth, thick noodles and pork belly for $11.50. The portion size is quite small and some of the noodles were stuck together. We also ordered the fried chicken ($6.50) however it came out soggy. We let our server know and the chefs refried it for us. Overall it's okay but not the greatest"}
{"text":"Stopped by one rainy afternoon as I was walking past. Lunch service was nearly over but my partner and I got our orders in. The ramen was delicious, nice broth, great bowl. Karage is a must try. To top it off they served the Millie Crepe cake that we adore ( look for Millie crepes in Kensington ). Service was excellent, very attentive and pleasant. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend and had their \"Meat lovers\" Garlicky Touhenboku Ramen.  Much like what others have said before me, I noticed the soup was a bit \"thicker\" ... viscous would be a more appropriate word for their soup base.  While I wasn't used to this compared to other fine ramen establishments we have in Toronto, it was something I enjoyed and got accustomed to rather quickly.  Another thing I noticed is that their cuts of pork are a bit fattier than I normally like, so it would have been a nice to have an option to opt out like other ramen spots in Toronto.  The servers were quite attentive and quick to have us seated and were quite friendly.  As far as I can tell, this ramen joint is indeed legit and run by Japanese owners.  The only thing that was off was that I thought the service was a bit slower, considering it wasn't rammed when I sat down.    While not my favourite (Santouka is!), it's a great addition to the Queen West neighbourhood and another viable (in slurpy goodness kind of way) option. This place definitely hit the spot, especially if you're having an appetizer as well as a more meat in your ramen.  Moar ramen for everyone!"}
{"text":"Ate a nice bowl of ramen there, the bill was about $15 after tip. Didn't take a receipt because I generally trust people to be decent. Checked my credit card statement a few days later and they charged me $21.90.  Fool me once, shame on me; but rest assured I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Was meaning to check out this ramen shop in my neighborhood because we usually go downtown for our noodle fix. Looking at the photos and reading some great reviews, I was very excited (and obviously had high expectations); however, Touhenboku disappointed me.   We ordered gyoza as an appetizer; I would skip these. When they came to the table, they looked delicious. After one bite, all I could taste was water; the meat filling was quite bland as well. They're frozen and just microwaved so the texture was rubbery. As my main, I ordered the ramen + donburi set. The garlic flavored ramen with 'thick' noodles was 'meh' for me; the menu raved about the strong garlic flavor and how it's a Touhenboku classic. I'm a huge fan of garlic and found my ramen to be underwhelming. For the donburi, I ordered the chicken karaage bowl. It was bland tasting fried chicken drenched with mayonnaise over plain rice. All in all, the one word that describes the food here - b l a n d.  We went for a late-ish Saturday lunch at around one o'clock. The restaurant was not too packed; there were maybe 2 or 3 other patrons so the staff:patron ratio was definitely in our favor. Anyway, the service was terrible. It was quite slow to begin with. Once finished our meals, we waited for our server to return because I wanted to order the mille feuille. I said 'excuse me' to one server; she saw me and just walked off. 'That's rude,' I thought, but I gave this person the benefit of the doubt. Another server passed by my table and again I said 'excuse me'. He saw me as our eyes met, but he too just walked off. Finally, another server came by after about an additional 10 minutes of waiting. In this time, we managed to stack all our plates and place them on the side of the table. The restaurant is quite small so it's not like we were hidden in a corner.  The food was 'meh' and the service was so bad that I don't think there's a reason for me to return."}
{"text":"You know when you get such awful Service it ruins the taste of the food? Well that's the case here. So I prefer to get takeout and call ahead because the ramen itself is amazing.   My rating is for the service it's so bad. Like so bad. I have gone 3 times to sit in. Hoping that maybe just maybe it would get better. But nope. They don't offer water. They don't check on you at all during your meal. They don't smile. They are grouchy and rude. And don't even look at you when talking. They rush you in and out and then get annoyed if You don't leave a good tip.   I will never eat inside there again. But I will call ahead for takeout because their ramen is fantastic  lol."}
{"text":"Alright ramen if that's your only choice. Expensive compared to the ramen places. Portions are less than expected even with extra meat. Pork belly was good, melted in mouth. The spicy ramen isn't spicy compared to other spicy ramen around Yonge and finch or in markham/Richmond hill areas."}
{"text":"On a cold Monday night after class I was looking around for some place to eat, instead of the Subway around the corner that I use to go, I Stumble upon Touhenboku, a ramen restaurant 2 stores down the road. I went in without much expectation since I've visited many ramen restaurants before. First Impression, the restaurant setup was fairly modern and clean, there are plenty of staffs and they were really pleasant to interact with and polite. Their menu was very simple 5 choices of ramen with added toppings and noodles with choices of sea salt/ soy sauce for your broth, and also an added bonus of a choice between the fat belly pork or the tender more tougher meat from the blade chops. I went with the original Touhenboku ramen for a taste, and also had a side order of korokke. Since there was nobody else around at the time,so I couldn't get a good estimate on their serving time during busy hours, but the food came fairly quickly so I was pleased. The ramen's broth is on the thick side, for some it may taste oily but for me it was cooked to perfection, since from my understanding that in order to get a thick rich broth, the chief has to put a lot materials and time into cooking the broth. The elasticity on the noodle was impressive, the only other time I've seen such a elastic noodle was at a Chinese noodle place where the chief pulled it by hand. The soft boiled egg was done very well. The overall presentation of the ramen was pretty standard, nothing too special that it detach itself from the ramen we see around in Toronto.  So to give specific rating here is the break down.  environment 4/5 service 4/5  ramen: 5/5 broth: 5/5 toppings: 5/5 overall presentation: 4/5  Obviously this place isn't for everyone, but if you are looking for simple ramen with great elastic noodle and good thick broth, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This was a while ago and will keep it short and sweet.  Noodles are were not over-cooked but just at the right point where it is el-dente.  A bit of spring to the noodles that doesn't get too soft while sitting in the broth.  The pork broth was warm and hearty.  A little thicker consistency than some of the other ramen places but for winter, it is a welcome feeling.  Makes you want to pick the bowl up and drink down every last drop.  The pork belly was done well and had that thick layer of fat that was oh so delicious.  With the explosion of ramen places around the city, this one is worth keeping an eye on."}
{"text":"Come here if you care more about the chewiness of the noodles in a bowl of ramen. This place is a good choice for those who are vegetarian or don't eat pork (they have chicken base broth). For the rest of us, this ramen joint is alright.   Their redeeming item here is their noodles. They can definitely improve on their soft-spoiled eggs, considering how easy it is to make.   Compared to the more popular joints, Kinton definitely has more tender, flavourful, and better meat-fat ratio pork belly than Touhenboku. The richness of the broth here is on par with Sansotei's."}
{"text":"Good service, ramen tasted alright, but man the broth was so thick(in a bad way)/oily that I felt nauseated throughout the night... I got the garlic broth with pork belly, maybe that's why. Still, not sure if it's coincidence or what, but my experience after the meal made me never want to go back."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating ramen and I can confidently say that this is a pretty good ramen place, nothing special though! My friend (who actually eats trendy foods unlike myself) said and I quote \"it was fine!\" So I take her word in confirmation. Although, one thing that I stood out was their lunch set ($15.50 for ramen and a small dessert) and dinner set ($20.25 for a beer, small side and ramen) which is pretty good value! The only problem is that deal is on a separate menu so we had to miss out on that one :("}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and it definitely has good lunch set menus (with your choice of one ramen and one donburi rice bowl). I came here around lunch time on a weekday, 1 pm, and was seated immediately. I think the ramen was just like any other ramen I've had before, but what makes this place unique is its decor and its service.   Also had the option of following their twitter and getting one free extra topping. I got the extra cha siu but would recommend getting an extra Nitamoga. It was the most delicious I've had by far, one bite and it melted into my mouth.   I liked this place, but wouldn't love it enough to return. I would rather try out another Ramen place"}
{"text":"I was hungry one ev'ning  The sky is getting dark  Stomach growling, grumbling I need something close, not far   Touhenboku was my choice  I've been here many times  Not as much as Devon W But enough to give a like   Black garlic is my true bae  Chicken all the way  Sea salt complements the best I won't change anything  Just need to give one dollar  extra noodles on the side  What a deal! What a steal!  It's so great, it's no lie   Broth is creamy to the max  The chicken melts in your mouth Noodles are chewy and firm  It is worth going down south   Dining area's spacious  Especially in the summer  To miss your chance eating here  That'd be a real bummer   Wish they had stronger AC  I'm sensitive to heat  But their ramen's really great  They just cannot be beat!   I love you, Touhenboku"}
{"text":"I've always preferred udon over ramen... Until I tried Touhenboku. I've tried every dish they offer noodles, rice, appetizers and desserts included. Needless to say, I'm a fan. My favorites are the light ramen (thin noodle, rich pork. sea salt), the karrage, and i'm torn for dessert. Both the mille crepe and the japanese cheesecake was nothing I'm used to, they're both very light desserts, super fluffy and very satisfying."}
{"text":"The worst ramen in toronto.  I got the garlic one and it was very weird tasting and the vegetables were super bitter.  The food was super oily including the rice and appetizer dishes.  Do not recommend this place at all.  I tried it with three other co-workers and we all hated it - I was also sick after eating here. Avoid and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What's with all these ramen shops all of a sudden?  We enjoyed a great bowl of Ramen  They offer a variety of choices  Choose the protein  Choose the broth  Choose the soya, miso or salt  Choose the noodles thick or thin  Slurp up!  The meat lovers is $13 but the chicken order is 4 slices of pressed chicken that is her bed.  It was tasty but many are expecting chicken breast  Usual octopus ball apps are very good  Dom burn bowls for those not wanting to enjoy the broth  Decent dessert selection but slices seem small in size  Lots of combo specials and I love that they have one size sake and dark japanese beer----huge plus for me  Great service as the girls struggle through their English so I assume they are here from Japan  I am used to  single coin 500 yen bowls in japan to feed the salary men but this broth and noodles are excellent.....  They have a club card where you can become a ramen master after 100 bowls"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch today. Ordered my miso pork belly ramen. Honestly, it was rather disappointing. I found the soup base a bit too thick n overly oily. I only finished half of the bowl. I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"The ramen is very oily. The taste is average. Not my favourite place. The interior decoration was very neat which makes the dinning experience a little better. The waitress was also very nice. It's a good place to try but the shop could really improve its ramen' quality."}

I really enjoy getting the Chasu Ramen which is one of their special ramen dishes. We also a ordered side of Takoyaki balls which was quite delicious. When you select a ramen dish, you get to select thin or thick noodles, the kind of both you want and the kind of meat cut you want. I ordered the garlicky broth with thin noodles and pork belly. The broth was quite nice and delicious and pork belly. Seasoning was great as it wasn't too salty as what happens with most ramen places.  In terms of price, it's not bad considering the amount of ramen noodles and meat you get. It is definitely one of the better ramen places I've been to in the city. Although, there isn't a whole lot of space inside, it's quite a nice small ramen place to visit on Queen Street West. The staff here are quite friendly and service was pretty good as our waitress kept coming back to refill our water and check on our food. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a good ramen to come. Great place for lunch or a late night meal. I'll come back to try some of their appetizers next time along with some desserts!"}
{"text":"The broth is what makes ramen amazing. If everything else is on point but your broth isn't...you're screwed. Unfortunately, that is pretty much the case with the ramen at Touhenboku. Although the light ramen that I ordered had a lighter broth, I found the broth to be overly salty and too watery. The chicken fell apart when I picked it up. There was also a lack of toppings (minus the eggs...the eggs were one of the few things that saved the ramen). The size of the ramen is also crucial. Ramen is meant to be very filling. The size of the ramen bowl at Touhenboku is about the size of a small bowl of pho. If you're looking for something light, perhaps the size of the ramen here at Touhenboku would be perfect for you. For me however, the size should've been bigger. What I did like about the light Touhenboku ramen that I ordered was that the noodles were perfectly cooked and that there were two eggs (instead of one like some ramen shops). We had the mille crêpe for dessert and it wasn't too bad. It tasted like it has been defrosted for a while but overall, dessert wasn't too bad.   I also liked the modern wooden decor and how nice and accommodating the staff were. Service was also very fast. I wasn't too pleased with the utensils though - my soup spoon was either used (and the staff neglected to notice that it was) or it wasn't washed properly. At least one of the servers was really nice about it and immediately gave me a new soup spoon.   If you take your ramen seriously, I would not recommend coming here. Overall, good and fast service and nice decor. However, since I love my ramen, I would probably not be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"The exposed brick walls paired with the crystal chandeliers gives Touhenboku a very cool vibe. The servers are very friendly and attentive, but most importantly, the ramen is delicious!   Their ramen menu is \"build-your-own\" style- I love that this allows you to create your own unique flavour profile! They have 4 broths to chose from (Traditional White, Spicy Red, Garlicky Black or Light), 3 proteins (Chicken, Pork Shoulder or Pork Belly) and 3 seasoning options (Sea Salt, Soy Sauce or Miso).   The first time I went, I tried the Garlicky Black Broth and while it had great garlic flavour, I found that it actually ended up making the broth a little bitter and left a very strong aftertaste (maybe the garlic broth is just an acquired taste?)  The Traditional White Broth is much better in my opinion and when I paired it with Chicken, Soy Sauce and Thick Noodles, it was simply divine!   The portion is incredibly generous and I always leave feeling extremely satisfied. If you've never tried ramen before, Touhenboku is a great place to start!"}
{"text":"My first experience in this ramen joint was good. Easy to spot location, clean, friendly staff. It wasn't busy when I went on a Sunday for lunch at around 1pm.  I enjoy chicken ramen broths because they tend to be less rich than tonkotsus. I like both broths in general actually. I ordered the lunch ramen special that includes a buri: black garlic ramen with thick noodles and karaage on rice. Noodles were not mushy, the pork was tender and juicy, and broth was balanced with the strong garlic and lightness of chicken broth. I love garlic so hands down for the garlicky taste. One star down for the egg. It was not as soft boiled as what I expected. The chicken was juicy and tender. A lot of kewpie mayo though but that can be easily scraped off. No biggie. I didn't finish my rice because I wanted to finish my ramen.  Definitely eating here again. I like their menu setup a lot for mix and matching."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place so finally dropped in. So the way it works here is that you create your ramen by mixing and matching from a number of options. I got the original flavour with pork broth, sea salt, thick noodles and pork belly. I found it to be just ok as it wasn't that flavourful and the broth was not as creamy as I thought it would be. I also got to taste the spicy flavour with chicken broth and soy sauce seasoning. It was much better than my order so looking to come back and try that next time.  They also offer donburi and various sides such as gyoza and takoyaki which I'll be sure to try next time.  Service was ok and food came fairly quickly after we ordered. It wasn't busy when we got here but definitely picked up as dinnertime approached.  Overall my food was ok I didnt love my ramen but I'm hopeful that other combinations will taste better. I will definitely be back to try everything else this place has to offer."}
{"text":"A slightly different set up from the other ramen joints. You pick your ramen, flavoring, noodle type and then sides.   I went with the white ramen. Soy flavoring. Thin noodles. Pork belly.   Noodles are made fresh and had that slight bounce. Go with the thin traditional thickness. Chicken-based broth is decent but not my first choice for flavor.   Overall above-average if you're into the noodles and chicken broth base but I wouldn't put it above Santouka which still is tops. Top 8 ramen joint in Toronto though."}
{"text":"It was first time to go there to have dinner with my friend.  The service was good, friendly and fast.  I ordered a ramen.There's Costumer was only us, but we waited only the ramen around 20min. Also the ramen taste was too terrible... It was looks nice but the taste too salty and bitter:( I ordered soy sauce flavor, my friend ordered salt, but the taste was both the same. I'll never gone to touhenboku. Advice You shouldn't go there, toronto has some better ramen restaurants."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a ramen place a little closer to home. We decided to try this place out. I like the ability to customize your order. However over all we'd were not happy with our meal. We both chose pork shoulder with our ramen and instead of getting braised shoulder like we are used to we got a slice which was difficult to eat. The eggs were hard boiled. It seems that they hard boil eggs ahead of time. The egg yolk should be runny and seep into the broth when broken open. The noodles tasted good. The broth tasted ok although it appeared to be thickened by what we think is cornstarch giving it a strange texture. We decided not to return there. The hunt continues!!!"}
{"text":"needless to say, i didn't finish the broth. the service was not present. I walked in and they told me from across the room to sit wherever. the restaurant itself doesnt seem very welcoming. Would most likely not come again, unless i was in the neighborhood and really craving ramen and had limited time.   Went on a Wednesday at around 5:15pm and it wasnt busy, so no wait time really."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, friendly and delicious. It's why I keep coming back. The ramen is great with lots of options, nice salty broths and al dents styled noodles minus all your lines. It's one of my regular spots and I crave it."}
{"text":"Really fast and friendly service! Menu is easy to read and prices are decent. This restaurant is pretty busy on a Wednesday night but if you come with a friend or two, the wait shouldn't be long. Food is decent but nothing outstanding (Red Spicy Ramen and the White Original)."}
{"text":"The soup base was a little too thick to my liking. It's not like the other pork bone / chicken soup base which you feel that they are just rich; this base is a little thick to the extent that it fills you up quickly. We had a brief chat with the chef and found him to be a very nice person :)"}
{"text":"Was here for a quick lunch.    I was surprised they charged extra for the pork broth (extra $1) than the chicken broth.  The garlic flavour paste tasted burnt, and there was one piece of meat which felt a bit cheap, considering it was about $14 per bowl, all in.   No line-up but would not go back."}
{"text":"Terrible Ramen. The pork was 80% animal fat and I didn't even finish half my food. I almost never leave food behind! The gyoza was soggy and so were the noodles in the soup.   There are two other Ramen places close by, one near Bathurst that's great and a new one at spadina that I have yet to visit. I would recommend going anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. The ramen was delicious. Tried the original ramen with pork broth, miso flavour and added a soft-boiled egg for extra umami. I asked for the pork belly and it was great but I think 1 piece is not enough - 2 pieces of pork belly would be ideal. Overall, Im happy I finally found a good ramen place close to where I live. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Such a delightful bowl of noodles. Met my expectations of a very good bowl of ramen. Pork was tender and noodles very delicate. I'll be back again for some more."}
{"text":"I tried this place today (Saturday) and it had a steady flow of customers. Its a small and quiet place to dine in and our server was really nice. I had the Red Miso Ramen (If I remember correctly) with thick noodles as my choice ..and tbh I wasn't as pleased with the taste sadly. It wasn't bad but I had better ramen somewhere else in Toronto. For appetizer we had karage (you can never go wrong with it) and for desert we had tiramisu and a millet crepe.. which was yummy and a must try. Would I go back? I guess so. But not anytime soon. And oh yeah, don't go there if your with someone who has a big appetite, they'll be disappointed and still hungry afterwards. Unless they want to order more.. but you know...just saying."}
{"text":"I know.. people always rave about new ramen places when they open....and for this place,.. the new ramen noodle making machine that was shipped from japan, costing over 40k..blah..blahs... anyways now to the real stuff..   Came here on a Friday night, wasn't that packed. Got seated with my friends. Some of us order the tonkotsu pork based ramen and I ordered the chicken based ramen.   The tonkotsu was quite disappointing becuz of the amount of oil when you put your spoon in and take it out. The spoon was so shiny with oil...ewww...   The soup base wasn't hot enough, maybe that's the reason why it felt like really oily. Didn't even make any attempt to drink the soup. Chicken ramen was slightly better but still not hot enough.   Ramen, we ordered thin noodle type, which taste like packaged Chinese noodle you can buy in cheap supermarkets... Epic fail!!!   also ordered the karaage chicken, 4 pieces for $4.95, get out... it wasn't that delicious...  My friend that goes to Japan twice annually was quite disappointed.   Go to santouka or sansotei... way better!"}
{"text":"The ramen today was little disappointing, the soup base was too salty and oily, too thick. There were very little ramen noodles and only 1-2 slice/s of meat in a bowl. I still felt very hungry after finishing my bowl of ramen.  The service was quite slow and we had to wait a while until we could make our orders or for our food to  arrive.  Might prefer to try other locations for next time."}
{"text":"Wow !  That was so good . I've never tried any Japanese Ramen , but THAT was Damn tasty !!  The staff was great and very helpful"}
{"text":"This place had really good ramen! I recommend picking pork shoulder for your choice of meat. Overall the ramen was delicious and a lot better than kinton ramen, I finished the whole bowl :)"}
{"text":"Good value for money here, at just under $15 for a basic ramen with broth and meat of choice, served with thick or thin noodles, boiled egg, mushrooms, and seaweed. Some choices cost extra though, including the vegetarian option which is a bit limited (no garlicky black broth option), pork broth, or extras like veggies. My chicken broth/black flavour/thin noodle/pork belly ramen was good to the last drop -- I actually drank all the broth from the bowl! Nevertheless, I felt like the broth could have been a little more flavourful. Still a solid and speedy choice with fast service and no wait (on a Monday night, anyway), and conveniently open til midnight!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I've walked by this place a dozens times so of course today on what is possibly the hottest day on earth, I decided I needed to have some hot ramen!  It's a cute place inside - exposed brick, crystal chandeliers and clean.  It is small so for big groups it might be a bit crowded  Their menu is simple for ramen - choose your broth/meat/noodles (thick/thin) etc.  so you can really customize it to your liking.  I got the light/soya sauce/chicken/thin noodles. It was just slightly too salty for me..but overall good.  The noodles had a nice chewy texture but I didn't like the chicken.  It tasted of nothing...and kinda looked like mystery meat lol  You can get extra toppings...but honestly paying $1 for extra scallions is a high.  They have a limited beer/sake drink list (maybe more expansive at dinner? I went for lunch) but that's fine with me.  Sapporo and a few sakes - too many choices sometimes muddy the experience   I haven't tried any other dishes here but look forward to trying a few others."}
{"text":"*2.5 Stars*  I really wanted to try this place, and came with my cousin (my usual ramen eating DC).  The flavours were nice, they ran out thick noodles, do I didn't get a chance to try that.  The soup had a weird consistency.  I ate it with my eyes closed, but my cuz couldn't stomach it.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here, but I wouldn't hesitate to stop in if I were in the neighbourhood, and there was no line.  To be honest, Kinton is still my fave."}
{"text":"Oh gosh... so yummy. I can't even put it into words.  Get the spicy bowl and an extra egg."}
{"text":"I had the miso pork ramen with thick noodles while my companion had the shio pork noodles. My broth had way too much miso in it. It was very salty and thick. The noodles were too dense and it wasnt very pleasant to chew. The meat was nothing special, maybe a little on the dry side. The egg however, was perfect. Wonderfully seasoned and gooey in the middle. The tea was very nice as well. My companion also had a very salty broth and the dense noodles. I doubt I'd come back for another bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"The Ramen was average, not the best ramen I have ever tried. But the octopus potato ball was really good! The service was okay, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food, EXTREMELY poor service. We had ordered two bowls of ramen, an app, and a dessert at 6:20pm along with the table next to us. The app and one ramen came out within reasonable time. The second one, however, didn't. I inquired about it at 6:45. The server said \"they're making it.\" We waited - but when another 15 minutes passed and the table next to us had finished eating and paid, I asked the same server if I could speak with the manager. Since she wouldn't come to our table even after acknowledging seeing me, I had to walk over to her. The server, Minami, blatantly ignored me standing there and whispered to her coworkers. No offers of any compensation whatsoever were made. Then she told me that they don't have a manager. So I asked to speak with the owner, and she said he's not there so I asked to speak with him on the phone. Another server phoned the owner and let me speak with him directly. I explained the situation. Btw, our second ramen still wasn't there at that time! The owner informed me that they DO have a manager right there working at that time, but he was in training.  Handling customer complaints is not part of his training? Seriously?! The second ramen arrived at 7:15 - nearly an hour after the order, and 30 minutes after my initial complaint. Dessert was still missing. Water was never refilled. No one came to check on us or collect empty dishes. We waited some more, stared at the servers (who were deliberately not looking in our direction), and absolutely NOTHING was done about our complaint. Dessert never came. We will never be returning, and we'll be discouraging our friends from going to that terrible place. I've dined in numerous ramen places, worked in one for a year, and this is BY FAR the worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Ramen isn't something that I keep going back to, I'm more of a sushi type of guy. I had the lunch set and I have to say that it was very good. I choose the light chicken stock and the soya sauce base, the soup was light, flavourful and delicious. Equally delicious was the small bowl of chicken don, lots of flavour and tastes great.  The rise of the ramen shop in Toronto isn't really all that surprising, unlike the sushi explosion most Ramen shops have really good quality product. I would gladly done at this establishment again."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place. I usually order it delivery through foodora or ubereats. Sometimes when I'm extra hungry I order extra noodles and it makes me extremely happy lol. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that this was my very first ramen experience. Hard to believe, I know. So take this review with a grain of (sea) salt because a ramen raven I am not.  The vibe: Busy little joint on the Queen West strip. We had to wait a bit to get our server to come by initially, but once she did it was very prompt and great service.   The food: For a first time ramen-er this place is amazing. I tried the spicy (red) ramen and absolutely loved it. Devoured almost the whole thing.   My go to meal: Spicy ramen.  Secret: There's a great lunch deal where you can get a beer + a ramen for a really good price!"}
{"text":"I always get the black garlic oil one with thick noodles and it's been consistently good. I think ramen is a great comfort food that everyone should try.  The portions are adequate though you can definitely get sides. They're all standard ramen shop fare and the best choice is gyoza, which is often part of a combo. Karaage and takoyaki are also good. Add the rice dishes if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"I never had ramen before besides me.noodles. this was my first time and I went to this on a date and it was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken soy broth with pork belly and it was spicy. I highly recommend it. The pork was delicious and so was the broth and everything it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The line started building up closer to noon. Service was alright.  I ordered the ramen with: * Chicken soup  * Thin noodles * Soy sauce seasoning * Pork belly  Omg, the ramen was wayyy too salty. I had to drink so much water - also didn't feel that good after eating because of the saltiness. I'll probably not return. On the positive note, the interior was clean and the ramen shop sign is very cute.. haha"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen and toppings, so-so value for the money. I have been to numerous ramen restaurants in Toronto, and my opinions expressed are relative to what goes on at other places.  The ramen and broth taste really good. The soup is richly flavored and contains just the right level of salt (unlike a couple of restaurants that go overboard). The meat is good too, but you only get one slice by default (for a pre-tax $10 bowl of ramen!); you can add 3 slices for $3. I felt that the quantity of noodles and meat were not sufficient for the price, and was expecting about 30% more as the norm.  The servers were fast and polite, and were a pleasure to interact with. The menu is easy to read and clear how to customize the ramen order. The environment of the restaurant has its good and bad points. The interior decor is rather neutral and doesn't give any particular mood. The noise level is average to low, unlike some other restaurants that are constantly busy and loud (I think that's by design when you sit next to the kitchen?). For reference the employees speak Japanese, if you want to compare with other Asian-cuisine restaurants run by Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, etc. An odd intrusion on the relative peacefulness at the restaurant was third-party take-out couriers arriving at the door several times per hour waiting for items to grab and deliver - something I rarely see at other places."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service. The portion sizes are good value. The pricing was reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"Awful.  The soup base was tasteless and the pork was very fatty in both dishes ordered.  It gets an extra star just for the somewhat attentative service because it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I went to the Queen location. I got there for 5:30 and it was starting to get packed. By 6, there was already a long line up.   The service is good and the food is yummy. It's my first time having ramen though, so nothing to compare it with. I got the black garlicky and towards the end, I found the taste to bw too strong, still good none the less.   I got an extra plate of noodles since I was so hungry. I thought I'd finish it, but no go.  My bowl, including the extra noodles was even $13.   I will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Good service.. Food was meh.  Broth was a bit cool, pork portions were tiny.  Not crazy about it considering the price.  I do like the fact you can customize your bowl, but needs to be executed a bit better... :("}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and have had two wildly different experiences.  The first time was during the summer a few years ago, when they were offering a special summer noodle dish. Sadly I can't remember what it was called, because to be honest, it it was one of the best Japanese cold noodle dishes I've ever had in my life (and a cold noodle dish is my default order at a ramen place so trusss) - the noodles alone were out of this world, the broth had intricately layered flavours, the toppings were impeccably cooked. It was honestly amazing I can still taste it now.  However I tried going again more recently and ordered a standard ramen dish, to see how they did, and i was hugely disappointed. I appreciated the customizability but the noodles honestly tasted like regular spaghetti noodles - really bizarre to find in a ramen. I remember being disappointed by how non-garlicky the black garlic flavor was."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other people for a weekday lunch.  Was busy between noon to 1pm and many empty tables after 1pm.  I got the $14 lunch set that came with a regular bowl of ramen and also a smaller donburi rice bowl.  I chose the black garlicky ramen with pork belly and Chicken Karaage Don.  Was dissappointed by the one piece thin pork belly but everything else in the ramen was done well.  The Chicken Karaage don was good and had plenty of chicken piece in it.  The portion size of the ramen was smaller than I would like.  If you are hungry I'd go with the lunch set as the Chicken Karaage Don changed this review from a 3 star to a 4 star review.  They also gave us a discount card which gives us a free ramen after the 10th bowl and also on the way out we saw a sign for some happy hour Ramen specials."}
{"text":"I was driving along Queen Street and Touhenboku Ramen's storefront caught my eye. I actually followed them on Twitter two days ago, and when I realized I found the restaurant, I decided to try it out with my girlfriend. The restaurant is small, but cozy and spacious. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. All the staff appeared to be Japanese, which makes it more authentic. Their Ramen was delicious! I ordered the Black Ramen, and my girlfriend got the Red Ramen. They were both very rich with flavour and unique in taste. Quite different than other ramen we've had in town. The bowls looked small, but after eating it all, we were quite full. Definitely a great experience. Would come back again for sure. Twitter followers get an additional free topping, so make sure to take advantage of that!"}
{"text":"I went late on a weeknight so it wasn't really busy. The servers were all standing around looking for something to do.  I had the meatlover with the thick noodles and light chicken broth with soy. I should mention I don't eat ramen often so I'm not sure if that layer of oil over the broth is normal or not. It didn't affect the texture of the food in my mouth and the broth was hit enough that it wasn't coating the food.   I'll probably go back again if I'm in the area but there's so much to eat in that area. I do like that's its open late. Makes it convenient to grab some food after a movie or right before a party."}
{"text":"Nice service by the staff, although their food taste okay. We tried the spicy ramen and the fried chicken bites, nothing special compares to other generic ramen spots in town."}
{"text":"The chicken soup base is good, the char siu got better than before. Overall it was good, but my girlfriend and I both had an upset stomach 3-4 hours later. Unsure if we would go back but it was definitely better (taste wise) than before."}
{"text":"The bowl size of the ramen is deceiving. Unlike the taste, it was still filling. I had the ramen black. Imo they were heavy on the garlic oil. I couldn't finish the broth and drank two glasses of water with the amount of sodium. I asked the waiter which tasted best together and the dish was a failure. Also the restaurant although small like all other ramen locations, was quite empty and the order took too long. The wait staff were very friendly, and maybe I'd consider returning for dishes not ramen related, but overall I had better.   No, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Hot and tasty! Simple menu, executed superbly. Consistently. Fresh. Loved the pork belly option.  Nice cold Sapporo.  My second visit in a week."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken-based broth with miso, chicken and thick noodles. The ramen was creamy, hot and delicious. Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Lunch delish. Had the garlic ramen noodles. They are currently celebrating pride week by offering 5% off your tab if you win at a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The waitresses are very attentive. Not 5-stars due to a bit of a compact space."}
{"text":"Touhenboku is a good option in the portion of Queen West that's usually not that good for dining.  Great for grabbing a bit before the symphony of opera.  Like most of the modern ramen places in the West this is a disaster for the indecisive: choose chicken or pork broth, choose a meat, choose some noodles, choose some other thing with the broth, choose any extra...wow.  The chicken broth is decent, but not the most traditional.  I find it a bit oily.  On the more traditional pork broth, I give it a solid 3 stars.  It's not as good as Kinton ramen, but it's not bad.  Just not quite as rich in flavour, and a bit more oily.    Staff are generally quite nice.  Beer is standard Japanese, $9 for a large Asahi.    OVERALL., good, but not as good as the best ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered a black (garlicky) and white (original) ramen, both with thick noodles and original broth.  Plentiful and very delicious. Typically I find ramen dishes to lack a good amount given the heftier price tags but for $10.50 a bowl, it was well worth it!  Sadly I wasn't able to try their famous Mille crêpes as they didn't serve on the day I was there but will make sure to next time around.  Quick service!"}
{"text":"The ramen here was good. I had the vegetarian option and it's very similar to the veggie option you find at all ramen places. But something about this place puts it below ramen places like Aji Sen and Kinton. Still pretty good though."}
{"text":"This place is good. There was no wait time for a table and the ramen was tasty. My friend and I often debate which is better between here and Kinton. I prefer Kinton but he prefers Touhenboku."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times. The first time was the best. I'm not sure why, but I was very impressed with their ramen. I had the original ramen with white broth and sea salt and I could tell that they make their own noodles because they tasted different and I liked that. I thought this ramen was delicious and I saw that the staff was legit Japanese. (For some reason I always feel better about a Japanese restaurant with Japanese staff.)  The second time I went they didn't have the sea salt option so I went for the shoyu broth. It wasn't as great but I thought it was ok and I had it with pork. I got sick that same night and I couldn't go to work the next day...  I also had chicken noodle soup for a week because my stomach couldn't take anything else. Whatever! I went back months later because I will always remember that their noodles taste so good. This time I even tried the cream puff; I really liked it! I forgave them for getting me sick.... and I will go again."}
{"text":"Tried the ramen on opening day.  Don't have take out available yet & the ramen is average.  I got the spicy pork ramen and I find the soup too thick and not spicy at all.  You can choose from thin or thick noodle, chicken or pork and soya soup base or salt soup base.  I'll give it a try again in a few months time!"}
{"text":"Very happy I walked in today at the lunch hour for takeout. Quick service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Service and food is great here, the pricing for the ramen noodles isn't overpriced either (I am thinking of momofoku when it comes to pricing) for about $10.50 before tax. I think generally speaking in the area, that is about the price when it comes to the ramen noodles.  The steps is similar to what you would expect in another ramen restaurant: choose your ramen dish, then your choice of broth (pork or chicken), choice of seasoning (sea salt, soya sauce, or miso seasoning), choice of noodles (thick or thin), and then the choice of meat (pork belly, shoulder, or chicken)  I had the black garlicky ramen which is their original ramen with their special garlic sauce blend. My friend had the red spicy ramen which was the thicky and creamy broth with some chili oil in it. Both were fantastic and great - except I find that perhaps adding the soy sauce for mine was too salty in the end... should've went with the sea salt seasoning (I'm assuming they only sprinkle a bit).  Overall, the soup was good, noodles were good, meat was meh as you would expect at other ramen places... not anything extraordinary. I would come here again for lunch and perhaps try their different ramens.  For lunch special they have a choice of ramen dish AND choice of a rice bowl for $14. This comes up to only about $7ish if you wanted to share that lunch special split the ramen and rice into two instead."}
{"text":"Service is always good but the ramen is not the best in town plus they recently increased their already high prices."}
{"text":"Remember the ramen explosion of a few years ago? Touhenboku is one of the survivors of that battle and it's not difficult to see why. Though their food isn't mindblowing in any regard, it's pretty consistent and that's easier said than done in the restaurant industry.   We arrived around dinnertime on a Friday night and all the tables were taken, so we were seated at the bar. I opted for the Red Spicy Ramen (\"authentic Ramen in a thick and creamy broth, with our special chili oil\") and asked for it with chicken broth, soya sauce, thin noodles, and pork belly. (Why do I have to make so many decisions to order a bowl of soup?)  Anyway, after practically begging our waitress for a glass of water and a fork (the latter of which I had to actually get up and ask for), the soup was handed to me by the chef himself. It's a good, satisfying soup that's adorned with tasty components (including a whole hard-boiled egg). This time around, however, I wasn't too impressed with the broth, which seemed overly salty and not spicy enough, and the noodles seemed a little undercooked.  Still, it's an easy and relatively cheap meal, so I'll undoubtedly keep returning."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: 5 Value: 5 Presentation: 5 Overall: 4.7 rounded up to 5  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. I'm trying out the garlic soy sauce ramen with extra meat and extra thick noodles. Let's dive right into the review.   The bowl was big and it was packed down. The extra noodles came in a separate bowl so I could dip it in after I was running out of noodles. I have got to say the noodles are top notch. Very reminiscent of the wonderful noodles I had in Japan. What I did not enjoy as much was the pork belly. It was very chewy and stiff unlike pork belly at other places where I can feel it melting in my mouth. That is my main complaint about this dish, everything else was perfect.  It is a small place, but service there is really good. I didn't believe how fast we received our order after ordering.  In terms of price, ordering the equivalent at other restaurants would cost a dollar or two more so that is very good. I liked how when I ordered extra noodles, I could realize that there were significantly more. Some places I question if they really did give me my extra noodles. I was so stuffed after that meal. I think the regular size was more than enough for me but I haveeee to get their extra noodles.  In conclusion, this is a small cozy place. Yet again, I am still fascinated at the chewy and tender noodles. I would definitely recommend this place to others. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Touhenboku at the Yonge & Eglinton location on Feb 23 for dinner. We both order the winter special ramen. It was fast and quick. The service was standard service.   Both of us got sick from the ramen from Touhenboku few hours later. We had stomach issues the same night. I spent the night with a plastic bag beside my bed. I am very certain it was the ramen since I didn't consume anything after the dinner.   Definitely will not return!"}
{"text":"I ordered their white broth noodles with pork belly and it was not bad. However, I'm only giving it a 3 star because the service was really slow, the broth was a tad too oily and salty. I'm not sure if I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Don't go here on a Friday at 7:30 for takeout. Quoted 10min and it took 30min. It's yummy food, just saying."}
{"text":"Amazingly tasty food, great atmosphere. Great for a drop in on a cold day. Support local!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place for ramen. I've only had Kinton before and I wasn't impressed with the slow wait, the kind of soup I ordered and the prices but I'm glad I found good ramen!   We first ordered chicken kaarage and the 5 pieces were big, meaty chunks of chicken thighs, large enough to share. It came with a mayonnaise sauce was very tasty - it was hard trying not to double dip!   The kaarage was so good I ordered the chicken kaarage don bowl and my boyfriend ordered the white ramen, soya based with thick noodles. Its definitely worth getting the extra noodles for 50 cents. We shared both our meals and felt so stuffed.   I noticed that the donburi bowls came with sushi rice so that was really filling. It was odd that the kaarage don was cheaper than the kaarage appetizer even though you get the same amount of chicken. Huh?   A good ramen experience for sure. I think I'll try Kinton again since I know what kind of soup Base I like now."}
{"text":"I can only say two positive things about this place. Service was fast and friendly and the ramen came with a whole boiled egg instead of half which I get in many other ramen restaurants. Tried the garlic flavour soup with pork belly meat and thick noodles and I think it was $10.50  I though the soup was really thick for ramen type soup and really didn't like the overall taste either. I just rushed eating my bowl of ramen and could wait to leave. I can honestly say I would rather have some spicy instant noodles than eat ramen here again."}
{"text":"Great place for a spicy miso ramen fix!  Haven't tried anything else on the menu ... But then again, why bother with such great spicy miso!  Servings are slightly big enough to drown in and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"The service was polite and quick,  the ramen exceeded my expectations (had thick noodles,  black broth, sea salt, and chicken) and was very filling. My friend had a rice bowl and enjoyed it as well. Will eat there again!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a couple of times and decided to try this place out since it was close to an event I was attending.   At first glance, it was a typical ramen place; we were greeted and seated right away. It was during lunch so it slowly started to get busy.   There are about four opinions to choose from for ramen with the choice of thin/thick noodles, soup base, seasoning and which meat you would like. I chose the Black Garlicky Ramen with thin noodles, chicken broth and pork belly (10.50$). It was okay but the flavours were just average. Nothing stood out but it tasted a bit too salty for my liking. There was barely a \"garlic\" taste as well.   This is average for ramen as there are so many ramen shops around town. I would rather travel elsewhere to satisfy my ramen craving."}
{"text":"BIFF and I went to Touhenboku Ramen on Queen West, which opened up late last year. Neither of us have been there before. I usual go to Momofuku in the Shangri-la and BIFF goes to Santouka on Dundas.  So I went with the Red Pai-tan Ramen with a soya based broth at Touhenboku. It's supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't. The broth here is definitely better than at Momofuku. But the \"guts\" of the soup at Momofuku, such as the pork belly & shoulder, and fish cake, are far superior in taste and quality (the reason it costs $16).  We also had the karaage and gyoza. They taste like how they're supposed to. I wouldn't rush to go here but if you do decide to, you'll be satisfied.   Pictures on: http://www.callherpennylane.com/2014/03/touhenboku.html"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area. (went for lunch approx 2pm).  Place was still pretty full for that late in the lunch service (no line though, thankfully).  Service was friendly, but they messed up the order a couple of times (the ramen bowls we ordered).  No biggie as we weren't in a rush.  Also didn't take long to correct.  Decor was good.  Our table was shaky though.  Hate that!  Food: -Takoyaki - Awesome.  I love this stuff.  Temperature was a bit less than what I'm normally used to, but it was still hot enough. -Gyoza - Some of the best I've had at any ramen place, plus they were a decent size.  Again, not quite as hot as I would have liked, but didn't make much of a difference. -My date had the Red (spicy I think) with chicken.  She liked it a lot -I had the Black (garlic) miso with pork belly.  Super good.  Kinda creamy.  They give you a choice of thick or thin noodles.  We ordered thick and still found them a bit thin.  Still very good.  $$ - Ramen in this city is generally on the pricier side for what you're getting, and this is about average in that regard.  After Tax & Tip we were looking at just shy of $45.    Were we full? Yes.  Was it tasty?  Yes.  Go often?  Not at that price, but I'll definitely be back eventually.  PS - (For those looking for a \"It's so much better than *competitor name* and worse than *second competitor*\", I don't really go in for that.  So take this review as you will.)"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin because I had never went to a ramen restaurant. I got the beef broth, regular, soya sauce, thick noodle with pork belly and an octopus appetizer. The food was better than I expected for instant noodles. The soup was well balanced and not really salty considering I had the soya sauce option. The noodles where soft and well cooked and the pork belly was seasoned well. The octopus appetizer was really salty and seemed like like it needed a sauce. Overall it was a enjoyable dinner and I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I expected to put Touhenboku somewhere in the top tier of ramen restaurants in Toronto after looking at the reviews. At the end, it was a very good place, but it's still one notch below the Kinton/Santouka/Sansotei/Isshin empire.  This place was extremely quiet on a Wednesday lunch hour. In a way it benefited me as I was in a bit of a rush that day, but I did have second thoughts on whether I should stay or leave. Seeing as how I got complete attention from the waitress and even the chefs, I decided to stay.  I ordered the Touhenboku original with thick ramen and pork belly. The bowl came quite fast, as I received my food in around 5-7 minutes. My first reaction was that the broth was quite light, despite the fact I ordered the original, creamier version. I only realized later that they use chicken broth for their soup base, so I'll give them a pass for that. The pork belly was decent though paled compared to Kinton, however the egg and seaweed add-ons were excellent! The ramen was not of the yellow kind; it was a lot more white compared to the other ramen restaurants I've been to. It tasted good, but not what I'm normally accustomed to.  Service was excellent, but probably because I was the only customer for most of the time there. Will I return? I would wanna try the miso soup base and perhaps the black garlic version, but to say this is the best ramen in Toronto would be a bit of a stretch."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I had an acceptable experience in the Toukenboku branch on Yonge Street, so I decided to try this branch on Queen since my current office is nearby. Admittedly, I didn't look at Yelp beforehand when selecting this place, as I solely relied on many of my friends who have been here and had positive reviews.  It was quite busy when I arrived at around noon on a Thursday, but I was seated promptly and taken care of. The menu is a little different from the Yonge branch, as this place is more of a \"DIY\" style of ordering ramen...unless they recently changed it to that kind of ordering format.  I ordered a black garlicky ramen with thick noodles, which costed $10.50; slightly more than average, but $10 is about the benchmark now for non-Chinese style ramen. The food took a while to come, but I was able to see the chefs make the noodles as I was sitting by the kitchen area.  I was honestly not too impressed with the ramen, as it looked too bland for my liking. Thankfully the ramen was chewy; just the way I like it. The chashu was also quite good, and honestly it was the chashu that saved this meal. The broth had the black garlicky feel, but it wasn't as rich as the other ramen places. I do understand that they use chicken broth, which may have played into the richness factor. It does feel healthier though, so if you're health conscious then this place is good for you.  Service was excellent the entire way, and it was easy to wave someone to take an order or to ask for the bill. If you're someone who prefers a healthier stock broth, then do try this place. However, if you're someone who cares more about taste and richness, you may find this place falling short of your expectations."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute disaster from the food to the service. First, the ramen noodles were basic and bland. Passable but not amazing. The broth was the biggest problem, it was so salty I was chugging water like mad. It was also greasy which made me feel like I had to vomit after I drank it. The lack of meat was also ridiculous. They have an option on the menu to pick the meat you want in your ramen and I wonder why they even bothered? They put less than a dime sized amount of meat in my ramen!  The service was absolutely terrible. The waiters might as well have been robots for how rude they were. They would just slap the food/water on the table, ignoring us talking TO THEM, and run away to the back. Because of how disgusting and salty the ramen was I needed water refills frequently and no one was helping me since the waiters didn't have the basic social skills to answer questions or notice me waving my hand. Eventually I just got up and grabbed the pitcher myself since my entire table was thirsty. It was a complete joke.  If I wanted subpar noodles and to serve myself I could have made instant noodles at home! Do not go to this place, it's a waste of money. You're better off buying instant ramen for 99 cents."}
{"text":"The ramen broth is way too oily (in a vegetable oil type of way) and not the consistency at all I'm used to expecting from Japanese restaurants. Otherwise the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"Block head makes a great bowl of noodles.   This was I believe my third visit to this restaurant. I say I believe as it has been more than a couple of years since the visit prior visit and my memory is getting hazy. But what I was instantly reminded of was the delicious taste and texture of the freshly made noodles. That is a big reason to keep coming back.   My wife had the original \"white\" broth which is very very creamy and has a nice taste. The chicken is not my favourite in the soup but was ok. I had the Light broth which is also a well rounded and full of taste with some softness around the edges.  The pork belly was very good and as mentioned the noodles are my favourite.   Service was fast and helpful. The place is clean and welcoming.  And since this was our first restaurant outing with our infant, their speed was very appreciated. I think we were about 20 minutes from arrival to exit!  Thank you."}
{"text":"I like this place! Have been a few times and always very consistent. Good ramen and appetizers (I've tried their gyoza and karaage chicken). Service is good and prices are reasonable. I've been 3 times and never had to wait for a table. Recommended for a local noodle joint!"}
{"text":"It is simple to order - one thing - soup - but so many options and add-ins that you need to take notes so you know what you had last time that was so good you had to come back!  My favourite: Ramen - black (garlicky) - pork belly - with a bowl of chicken on the side."}
{"text":"I met the owner of the restaurant and he was really nice, and although he was serving us he suddenly left and so we were served by other servers for the remainder of the meal. The restaurant was busy and the server switch caused us to have slow service at the end of our meal. The ramen was good, although I found the white soup to be too oily. If I were to come back I would get the clear soup instead. The texture in the ramen was very good with the crunchy mushrooms and green onions. I really enjoyed that aspect of the ramen.   We also tried the deep fried karaoke and that had a cream filling that was also quite fatty. My favourite part of the meal was surprisingly the dessert! Their recommended layered crepe cake with fruit glaze is just so delicious and not too sweet."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the thick noodles and the vegetarian option with the miso broth! So yummy and filling!"}
{"text":"Eeeeeh.  Where to start..   I like Ramen.  I'm not some connoisseur or anything,  but I can in the very least tell the difference between Ramen and soy sauce flavored water.   I ordered the black garlic Ramen,  which I assumed would be a 'tonkotsu'  broth..  Um,  yeah...  It's not.  I  guess their namesake is useful for misleading customers lol.    Noodle were rubbery frozen noodles that honestly were slightly better than instant Ramen noodles.    The broth was...  Not broth.  I'm all for salt,  I love me a sodium fueled heart attack bowl of Ramen...  But this had no other taste but salt.  Just soy sauce,  and water.   Very disappointing.  Maybe there was a packet of powder Miso soup in there,  but I wouldn't even give it that much credit.    I will say that the service was lovely,  waitress was attentive and quick even during the lunch 'rush'  (perhaps the fact that there was only 3 tables at lunch hour at Yonge and Eglinton in the only Ramen place nearby should've clued me in sooner,  oops)..  But yeah, good service didn't make my Ramen taste any better."}
{"text":"Decent ramen shop on Yonge. I came here twice and both times the ramen was really good. Five different kinds of soup base to choose from, then add either miso, or sea salt, then choose thick or thin noodles. The meat is cooked deliciously and overall each time the meal was very hearty and perfect for a cold day.  I had the chicken karage both times. The first time was amazing, but the second time seemed to miss expectations. It comes with a mayo too which is absolutely necessary. The seating is comfortable but the restaurant itself isn't that big so I'd come in small groups only."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times while shopping on Queen St. W. I would say that their ramen is quite good but nothing to rave about. Definitely not one of my favourite ramen places in Toronto.   I usually get their chicken broth because it isn't too salty.  My biggest complaint would be that the portion sizes are quite small for how much it costs."}
{"text":"My rating is based solely on the ramen (because it's a ramen restaurant)  Ordered karaage and black garlicky ramen (chose sea-salt seasoning, pork shoulder, thick noodles) with extra soft-boiled egg.  Karaage: not the usual karaage that you get in Japanese restaurants. It's coated with a different batter, but juicy nonetheless. For 5+ dollars, the pieces were huge!  Ramen: Soup was lukewarm which I didn't like. Not very flavorful either. Noodles were nicely done. Soft-boiled eggs was too cooked (read: hard-boiled).  Servers were friendly and the place is clean and cozy."}
{"text":"If I remember correctly, the first touhenboku store that opened was in Markham. At the time the store opened, there was lots of promo on social media. Though I never went due to distance. Now that the store has opened for a while, and that there are now multiple locations, the time had came for lazy people like me who refuse to line up to try!  Nobody in the store on a weekday evening.big thumb up! I got the most basic ramen with thick noodles. There's nothing special about the ramen noodle. The broth is not too salty, but I still felt a bit thirsty after the meal. MSG? Maybe it's because I've never being a ramen fan?   If I do come next time, I'd be sure to try the appetizer dishes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love Asian food and tried many while in Toronto but this place was definitely one of the very best! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during traveling to Toronto. The restaurant is clean and neat.  The staff is friendly. Ramen looks very authentic. I took RED. Actually all materials are very fresh but the soup is very weak. Maybe every materials are perfect but there amount of soup paste and water is not right. Kara-age is very jucy and fresh. It's perfect. But ramen is really less worthy. Hope it will be better as get have fresh stuff."}
{"text":"Th soup is a fair size and for an extra $3 you can get a ton of extra meat. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with extra meat and let's just say it failed in comparison to other chicken ramens. They give you the option of sea salt to soy sauce broth base and I went with the soy sauce thinking it would be more flavoured. Well the flavour sucked! It wasn't even like slightly well flavoured it was just awful. Way to salty! The chicken had a weird texture and again crap flavour the noodles weren't even good... Nothing good at all Bout this place besides that maybe they give you the option for extra meat which some place do not.  The \"spicy ramen\" wasn't spicy and was not worth the money at all.  Will not be returning.ever. Worst ramen."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a number of times and it's usually fairly busy. Like other ramen places they have a lunch set where you can save a few bucks and get a side dish which is worth getting to make sure you feel full.  I've had the spicy and the black garlic and I think I prefer the spicy because the broth has more going on with the extra spice. Unlike other ramen places the chicken stock is the base option while it's extra for pork or miso. I'm a big fan of miso ramen so it's disappointing when you have to pay extra for it.  Pretty decent place for a lunch but because of the extra cost for different stocks and the chicken stock isn't as flavourful as other stocks I've had it's not my go to ramen place."}
{"text":"Touhenboku is still bad. Light broth has no taste and is greasy and does NOT even taste like ramen broth. The noodles are pretty ordinary for a ramen shop that produces its own. Service is nice and pretty caring. But that broth... just.strange It is not the worst, the worst is momofuku but pretty bad"}
{"text":"Everything here is pricey (especially after coming back from Japan), but the karaage is always juicy and tasty without being too oily. And who doesn't like japanese mayo? The ramen is good, I always choose the black (garlic) soup base and drink it all like they do in Japan, even though I know it's definitely not good for me.   I do find that the service here is a bit slow, which makes it hard to have a lunch during business lunch hours. There aren't all that many seats in the restaurant, but I've never had trouble getting a seat.   No parking - pay on Yonge St or park further away on a residential road. They do take credit cards."}
{"text":"Twice I've been here and both times l've left disappointed. Broth was just thick and it tasted horrible. You can even see a layer forming if you leave it for a couple mins or so. It's a waste of $14, really."}
{"text":"Great service, love the plastic boxes provided to put your personal items in(such as purse or bag) so you don't have to put them on the floor. Vegetarian Ramen was tasty(not too salty) but same price as the meat ones $13. The only annoyance for me would be that i asked for house tea and received a mug with a tea bag in it. Upon inquiring it was explained that they don't provide house tea and perhaps English was an issue to the confusion when I asked if it was house tea when I ordered as they only serve 1 kind of tea(green tea) . The server also explained that others have complained about them not serving house tea but they don't plan on changing this dt them scoping out the area ramem restaurants and this a being standard practice. Fair enough. However I find it a little aesthetically lacking to have a tea bag hanging out of my cup. Also  two seperate orders of tea could have shared a pot."}
{"text":"pfffff... not to be harsh, but this place wont' last long.  ramen is becoming more popular around the city and this place puts ramen to shame!  my instant noodles taste better then this.  but i do give credit for the decor of the place and the service.  the meat also is nice and tender but you only get two pieces of this goodness.    the soup base is thick and constarch-like.  not my type of preference.    two thumbs down. will not return."}
{"text":"Yeah, not too impressed with this place. I'll say this...service is pretty good but the food should be avoided as a whole.  Right off the bat, broth WAY too oily. At the end I couldn't even finish the soup and when I was about to pay there was a film of oil glossed over the bowl. Not cool...  Egg was over cooked, no oozing yolk..pretty much a hard boiled egg.   The only redeeming quality to that bowl were the noodles which were cooked fine.  I then proceeded to get the Chasu Don that came with the ramen (lunch deal) and that was too...salty. Took 3 bites of it and couldn't eat anymore.  All in all, stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"Relatively small place with maybe seats for 25 people. Their ordering process is pretty straight forward with lots of customization (thin vs thick noodles, soy sauce or sea salt, shoulder or belly).   Ramen here is pretty good. Karaage is pretty juicy despite the big pieces. The cha sui rice bowl is my favorite tho."}
{"text":"We stumbled in here one day for lunch and found it to be pretty decent. We wanted ramen but didn't want to deal with the Kinton line or momofuku's hipster service. With minimal expectations from a restaurant on this part of Queen, we were pleasantly surprised by our noodles. I wouldn't make a special trip or date just to have their ramen but if I was kicking around this part of town, this would be perfectly sufficient for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Given that their slogan is a smiley tree trunk, I wanted to insert some witty banter into this post  but I was left stumped.  Once you've branched out to a number of ramen places, you run out of ideas.  Touhenboku turns over a new leaf by having the gall to focus on mizutaki (chicken broth) and knot the traditional tonkotsu (pork broth) as the base to its hearty soups. The flavours are quite rich which might help justify the fact that boles are a bit smaller than other ramen joints.  In the case of the spicy ramen, it's bark was worse than it's bite although the chili did add a nice flavour.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the gyoza, despite having a filling a little less poppy than others, were some of the better I've had since they were pan-fried to near perfection. In the end, Touhenboku has blossomed into good competition with other ramen houses in the area in regards to both service and more importantly, a decent bowl of soup.  Domo arigato Zuimei Okuyama...wood you please take a bough?"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Wednesday night, around 6:45 ish? Had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table for two. They handed out cups of tea to the people waiting in line, that was nice :)  I had the meatlover's/chashu ramen, black (garlic) flavour on a sea salt base.  Broth: 7/10 The broth was uh... strangely thick. Also, there could've been a bit more - I felt like the noodles/meat were taking a lot more space in the bowl than I was used to. It was very tasty, but I'm not sure how I feel about the consistency/thickness.  Meat: 7/10 Meat not as fatty as Santouka/Kinton, and slices were not as thick. However, it was still tasty and had a good amount of fat in it. I like it much more than the meat at Sansotei.  Noodles: 8/10 Noodles were nice and chewy, the broth was thick so there's a good amount of flavour sticking to them as you slurp it up. Apparently they're made from some high-protein flour with a $40,000 ramen machine (Google it).  One interesting distinction I'd point out from the other ramen shops I've been to is that the broth for all their dishes is derived from chicken (rather than pork), and you can choose chicken for your meat to substitute the pork as well. If you don't eat pork for whatever reason and chicken is OK, this is the ramen shop for you. Kinton offers the chicken ramen as one of their dishes, but they run out of that one quite often.  Last thing worth mentioning: stir the contents of your bowl a bit before digging in. For some reason, the temperature distribution throughout the bowl is super uneven. For me, it was steaming hot deep inside the bowl and barely warm enough for the stuff at the top.  I paid $17 with tip included, don't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered noodles with red soup, noodles are fine but the soup doesn't have much flavour. We also ordered appetizers, and they ere delicious! Especially the dumplings! won't come next for noodles, there are many options for having good noodles."}
{"text":"Updating my review here to 5 stars after trying another 6 ramen restaurants around the downtown. Creamiest broth I've had so far. Love the spicy miso and keep coming back.   10 check in update: I've been here about 30 times now... but whatever this is a milestone so let's update the review. It's been 4 months and this place just keeps getting better. I've tried every ramen and side dish (other than the donburi... that's next!) and it's amazing. Even the veggie and I never go veggie. They're really passionate about their ramen and their restaurant and it's paying off. They're asking input on every Everything from the menu to the music (which are all bangers now) and it's showing :)"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place several times and never tried it. Spontaneous decision lead me in here.  It was very good, clean and excellent service.  I tried the original Ramen and it was very good. Next time I come back, I will try the garlicky one. I didn't try it this time because of fear of stinky breath before I go out tonight."}
{"text":"So a few years ago, my sister took me here and I absolutely loved it! My friend told me she was craving ramen, so I decided to take her here for her first time ever. It was definitely nice visiting it again.   To start off, the restaurant is kind of small, but luckily there were no lines or anything. The servers were super nice and friendly! So I ordered the white (original) ramen with pork belly and my friend ordered the black garlicky ramen with pork belly and we shared the takoyaki and karaage.   The white (original) ramen with pork belly was amazing! Although the broth and noodles were amazing, the egg is out of this world! I know it's just an egg, but trust me, the egg tasted absolutely amazing! Anyways enough about the egg, I got chose the pork broth, thin noodles, and sea salt (I would recommend). The broth and pork belly had a lot of flavour and the thin noodles complimented it very nicely. The only downside I will say is that they are quite stingy with their meat. They only gave us one piece of pork belly each and that definitely wasn't enough.   Also, the takoyaki was alright, some pieces had too much of that tempura scraps, but they were fine. The karaage was great! I love the little sauce it comes with!   Overall, I would love to give this place a 5/5 stars as it is one of my favourite ramen spots, but they are just too stingy with the meat and until that changes, it'll be a 4/5 for me. If you're ever in the area, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Good combo, don and ramen. The ramen soup was really thick and filling. Something that left a taste after you finish eating. Wasnt able to finish my soup even though they gave a little only. Decent experience. But not the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"I got the pork belly with thick noodles, which I really liked and often ramen restaurants don't give you an option of thinner or thicker noodles. The pork belly was very buttery-feeling and smooth but slightly disappointing because there was only one slice"}
{"text":"for the record, i prefer pork-based broths.  my rating is a bit skewed."}
{"text":"Love their rice bowls but I get sick to my stomach every time I've tried their ramen....there are much much better places within walking distance in this neighborhood.   Dude from my building said the same thing happens to his girlfriend, that was the nail in the coffin for me."}
{"text":"Personally, my expectation for Japanese Ramen is very high. I have only tried the Black Sea Salt Meat Lover Ramen. The soup is the essence of any Japanese ramen, if the soup is good then the ramen cannot be bad. I had the black Sea salt ramen and i thought that it was tasty and full of flavor. You can taste that the soup base was cooked for a while and the flavor is rich. The pork belly I had wasn't too oily and had a good balance of fat and meat. All in all, could be perfected but I would definitely give it a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Having visited the Touhenboku up at Yonge and Eglinton area before, I have come to expect the ramen here to be rather light tasting. So this time when I had the pork and soy broth ramen, I chose to have it dressed with black garlic oil, and that was a great decision because it gave the ramen a much needed boost in flavour.  In general, I find that most ramen places are stingy with pork slice portions, and Touhenboku is no exception. I always have to fork out more money for extra pork to get a more satisfying experience. Even though I am familiar with having to pay extra, I find Touhenboku to be a bit pricey for what it is, and the broth itself is kinda underwhelming compared to other ramen places.  Overall, I guess Touhenboku is \"OK\" if you feel like having ramen and have no other options nearby, and not overly hungry."}
{"text":"Ooo definitely love this place! Was the first one there in the morning and in 20 mins it was filled up with a line waiting outside. Maybe that could be 1 disadvantage (size).   The Ramen...was delicious!!! Had the Res Ramen with extra pork belly. The broth was light with a hint of spicyness. Nothing was overpowering. The meats were tender. It was just plain delicious. I would recommend...to try them all (meaning to come back again and try somethinf new coz that is what i'll be doing)  On a side note, their karage chicken was also delicious!"}
{"text":"This was some excellent ramen! The broth is unique- it is creamy and unique like a good tonkotsu broth. Needless to say, I finished every last bit. A couple things: the egg was overcooked and some may be disappointed at the limited amount of choices as compared to other ramen houses.   I ordered chicken broth with think noodles and chicken meat. Very good!"}
{"text":"A perfect place to end up on a cold night. Small, cozy and delicious. I got the veggie ramen with thin noodles and added egg and corn. My friends got the thicker noodles, and I think that's the better decision. Ramen was delicious, though. A healthy portion that's sure to satisfy at a very reasonable cost. Recommend you stop in here!"}
{"text":"I am sitting, waiting for my order as I write this. It has been 40 minutes waiting for a ramen soup and rice dish. Friends of the chef have got their food within 5 minutes. By the time I got to this part of the write up, our food arrived. The rice dish was very plain, and the ginger chicken was very salty. My wife enjoyed the Ramen noodle dish and would get it again. Overall we had a subpar experience. The service was less than poor but they make up for it with the Ramen. So if you have an hour to kill, or if you know the chef, it's worth a shot. Personally I'm very unhappy with my experience"}
{"text":"Came here a few times and food is good! Got the garlic ramen with thick noodles first and I found it a bit too salty for my taste. I got the light noodles the second time and I liked this one much more! Love the meat they put on the noodles too!  The karage (chicken) don was also super good! Crispy and flavorful!   The service was nice, friendly servers!  The price however was quite pricey considering the portions aren't that big. The portions seem to be smaller than other ramen shops in the area.  This would be a good place to grab a quick bite but taste wise I still think that Jyuban is the best!"}
{"text":"Touhenboku Ramen is a ramen restaurant on Queen Street West. My friend wanted to try it out because she loves ramen. I passed by this restaurant many times but never paid attention to it. I was up to give it a shot.  We arrived on a Sunday evening and it wasn't as busy as I expected. There were a few patrons but overall, my friend and I had our space to chat without having to worry about the noise and crowd.  At Touhenboku, you customize your ramen. You get to choose the type of noodles you want, the seasoning, and more. Extra toppings cost extra. All ramen comes with nori, scallions, mushrooms, and an egg. If there is a topping that already comes with your ramen that you do not want, you can substitute it for another topping for free (excluding Chasu meat). It's perfect for people who like to customize their food to their preferences. I usually choose a spicy dish but I decided to change it up this time. I ordered the Garlicky Touhenboku Ramen and was satisfied with my choice.  Touhenboku Ramen is a good spot to hit up if you love ramen."}
{"text":"Got rejected from momofuku because of the line and stumbled across this joint. This place is on the ever quaint Queen Street West and stood out with its colours and logo.   I went with one other person and there was no wait. Larger parties had to wait a little longer but they had no problem accommodating them.   I ordered the pork+original+miso+sea salt+shoulder+extra belly while my friend ordered the meat lovers. It is cheaper to get it by $0.50 the way I did but the broths are a little different so its up to you! We also got a couple bottles of Sapporo that just compliments ramen so well.   The ramen came out relatively quickly and were very delicious. My broth was very rich in flavour and I really enjoyed the pieces of meat that came with mine. The meat lovers broth was a very good tinge of spicy without overwhelming the broth underneath. We were both very satisfied and happy that we stumbled across this place.   The service staff is very friendly and they are very quick for water refills. The facility is also very nice and clean. I really enjoyed my time here and will probably be back again to try the summertime cold ramen and the don bowls!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been to their Queen St location when they first opened and it was quite a disappointment. We decided to go to this location for dinner because we're in the area last night.  My fiancé ordered Light, Miso, Pork Shoulder with Thick noodles and the noodles were nice and chewy but he wasn't a fan of the miso base. As for myself, I got the Red, Soy Sauce, Chicken with Thick noodles. I was very happy that the noodles were chewy and not overcooked this time. The ramen broth was thick, but not gelatinous like the first bowl I had at their Queen location.   Overall, as long I'm eating the Red with perfectly cooked thick noodles then I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We were wandering in the area late one Saturday night looking for a bite to eat when we spotted this little gem. It was still busy, but we were greeted right away by the gentleman bussing the table. We were seated and given menus as soon as a table was ready. While we were deciding on our order, I watched our server interact and make conversation with all of the patrons (it's a fairly small establishment, so this was quite easy to do). It wasn't the usual \"how's your food?\" He actually made a point of discussing the merits of the food. When he came to our table to ask is if we had any questions, \"no seriously\", he said, \"ask me anything - relationship, financial or life advice.\" It was a great interaction.   On to the food. We both ordered the white ramen with pork. It arrived quickly and was delicious!  The gyoza, I was assured, was made on site and was very tasty.   If you're looking to impress a date, this would be the perfect place to go.   If they are still here the next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Coming from NY and the best ramen house there, this place was came to a close second. Got the vegetarian ramen with two soft boiled eggs and a side of hot sauce. The broth was a miso base and was tasty! Service could be a bit more attentive but overall good spot on a cold Toronto day!"}
{"text":"Ramen- on point. Chicken broth is silky smooth. Wakkame is flavourful, and I like the way they soft-boil their eggs. Staff is helpful and quick, if a little bit encumbered by their English language skills. Good value for dollar at $15 all-in for a very tasty, very filling bowl 'o ramen."}
{"text":"Having a casual dinner with friends. We have fried chicken, squid ball to share. I ordered a spicy ramen.   Today is not a busy day, so food comes up pretty quick. The ramen looks a bit small. However, it is enough if you are looking for something light weight, or leave room for appetizers. The appetizers are very delicious, you can tell they only make it after you ordered.   The place is spacious, however, it might not be a good place for chilling. Just like other ramen restaurants, they collect your bowl once you finish.  I give a 4/5 as atmosphere makes you feel like it is fast food restaurant. Paying ~18 dollar for fast food experience. It is kind of hard to judge."}
{"text":"Ordered some ramen for delivery from this place.. Overall the food was very mediocre and the service was great however towards the end of my meal, I chewed on something that almost broke my tooth... After investigating, and showing everyone around me, we came to the conclusion that it was very obviously a piece of gravel/stone...   The ramen was definitely not worth a visit to the dentist."}
{"text":"The white broth was so flavourful. It was buttery/oily when you first taste it, but it's so delicious that the feeling goes away and you're just left with wanting more. This is coming from someone who doesn't like anything salty/oily, but I found myself slurping up almost every last spoonful of that broth. The ramen bowls are $11, which is much cheaper than some of the other ramen places in town. The bowls are a bit smaller, but I left feeling more than satisfied. In fact, it was plentiful that I didn't order the desserts here, which appear to be quite popular! Every other table was someone enjoying their dessert after the ramen.   On a side note, we also ordered the Korokke app, potato and cream balls rolled in panko and deep fried. I did not enjoy this and would not recommend it. The texture of the filling was such a miss for me, tasted like over-mixed gummy mashed potato."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went on a ramen hunt which lasted for weeks, and we had all ramen available in Toronto. And this place has the best chicken ramen. The broth and the chicken are very flavorful yet light, unlike other ramen places which make me feel bloated afterward. Definitely come here if you love chicken ramen. Also, try their shrimp appetizer, it's also amazing."}
{"text":"You can tell I enjoyed my spicy shio ramen broth, because I drank most of it (and no, they don't have a prize for finishing the whole bowl like the Kinton Bowler). The noodles were thin and springy. You can actually choose whether you want thin or thick noodles. I thought there was a bit too much yuzu in my cocktail (it's their special, forget what it's called but at the top of their drink menu). They were quite nice and topped my drink off with more soda when I got to just the yuzu jelly at the bottom half. The owner of the store personally came by to see how our meals were going, and let us sample some of their specialty shochu's from Japan, he has them infused with various things (coffee, spices), to use them in their cocktails. The store is clean, large open windows at the front of the store, and modern decor. I stayed for quite a long time chatting away with my girlfriends, and no one rushed us out."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I've only been here for takeout and I like everything I've tried so far. I usually get the Chasu don with extra pork ($4.50+3.00 extra) and it is filling and satisfying. Also tried their karage and croquettes... fried chicken is nothing to write home about, it tastes the same at all ramen joints and croquettes were just okay. They have a great dessert menu which includes mille crepes and cream puffs! The best. Management/staff is super friendly, courteous and genuine."}
{"text":"Take the extra 10 minutes North of Yonge to make the trek to Kinton, or south to where there's a million other ramen places. Not only they are over priced, noodles game out soggy... toppings are bland. nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"It is nice to see that the newest location of Touhenboku Ramen trying to expand their menu during dinner time to includes Izakaya style item.   However, most of those we ordered were a miss or just so so.  We shared:  Eggplant with Minced Pork ($6.95) - Meh Chinese dish?  Ebimayo ($9.50) Shallow Fried Prawns with Spicy Chipotle Sauce - The batter just super thick  Karaage-Negimabushi ($7.50) Deep Fried Crispy Chicken Marinated in a spicy Scallion Sauce - The Best dish compared to others that we ordered  Godzilla's Egg ($6.50) Deep Fried Ground Beef Ball with Soft Boiled Egg - Meh, but the idea is interesting  For Ramen we tried the Red Miso Soup based ($10.50+$1.50) which was delicious and the noodle has a good bite.  For dessert we shared the Millie Crepe ($5.50) which was good but the Dense Chocolate Cake ($5.50) tasted so dry and hard.  It is good that Touhenboku trying to offer other option aside from Ramen but for the time being I would say it is not working.... I would stay with their ramen. And maybe the patrons knows, as no other tables order anything else but noodle!  Service though was excellent!"}
{"text":"Lunch Special: Sapporo with Any Ramen for $12....  Really?! This maybe one of the best lunch special I had for awhile....  Drinking my iced cold beer and slurping my bowl of ramen did put me in a good mood... and I ended up ordering a Millie Crepes ($5.50) as dessert too.   Staff in the restaurant is really friendly and helpful. Helped me with picking the soup based and the thickness of the noodle. I really enjoyed my ramen.  I will be back to try out other items but I will for sure save room for the Millie Crepes!"}
{"text":"Took my dad and Mum to here. We all love the Spicy ramen and fried chicken here!!!!!! Not pricy and big portion"}
{"text":"Came here after shopping on Queen Street. I have to admit that I really like this Ramen shop. Have been to almost all of the better Ramen shops in Toronto and this is up there with the best of them. Biggest plus for me is the extra Ramen noodles for 50 cents, yes 50 cents.   I like the fact that all of the servers are Japanese as well - it adds to the character of the place"}
{"text":"Their new salad (cold) noodles are very delicious. Very rich in flavors and especially suitable for summer time. The crepe desert is tasty too, for sure a surprise coming from a ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"The ramen here is fresh and tasty. A quieter joint than Kinton Ramen at Yonge and Empress. The soup is almost on par."}
{"text":"I like this place and frequent it at lunch time. It gets really busy but it's because the ramen is so easy to crave for. I order the black garlic ramen most of the time for take out. Their take out is efficient and the soup and noodles come in different containers which makes it fresh even walking back to work. The broth is savoury and garlicky. The noodles always tastes fresh. I really the think the soft boiled egg marinated in soy sauce is always a treat."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner break from the Princess of Wales Theatre. Service was crazy fast, I had the pork stock with soya sauce with thin noodles and pork shoulder. Also ordered a side of gyoza, which took a bit longer, 10 minutes, but were crisp and yummy. The ramen was good, not fantastic, but the stock was tasty, maybe a bit oily. I would like to go back and try another ramen to see how that one far. Overall I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I consider myself an experienced ramen eater. The BEST ramen I have ever had was at Kintaro in Vancouver (you can read my review).  Touhenboku was pretty nicely decorated - a good start BUT it we not enough to make the ramen taste better.  I ordered the Red ramen (spicy) with thin noodles and pork shoulder.   To me the broth is critical for ramen. The broth here was okay but nothing where I would say Wow. I kind of found it somewhat thick.   Second, the noodle is key. The noodle was good but somewhat heavy tasting. Maybe it's the flour used but it was average at best.  Now, the pork. Sorry folks, but it was dried and overlooked. You also only get one piece so maybe I was lucky.   In all while the venue and service was good, it wasn't enough to make up for the average ramen.  Moving on."}
{"text":"I have a cold. One of those nasty, drippy, painful face colds. And everyone knows that only a few things can put a dent in a cold like that: hot soup, garlic, and noodles. I wish I could say that after my bowl of Ramen at Touhenboku I felt better, but alas, I did not.   I ordered the Black (garlic) Ramen with thick noodles. The noodles get a star on their own - they have a good consistency, are chewy and really were the star of the dish. But for me, the ramen experience is a whole bowl deal, and this deal didn't cut it. First of all, there were far too many noodles. A noodle - broth - toppings balance is required. The broth is chicken based and is very thick. While I had originally written the word \"rich\" there, I changed it. A rich broth, to me, is a good thing - and doesn't always denote heaviness. This was a thick, heavy broth that had a strange chicken aftertaste that I found unpleasant. A stronger garlic flavour would have been welcome. I mean, I have had the garlic ramen at Kinton. So.... I have high expectations.  Two tiny pieces of overcooked pork were on top of the soup. I had asked for the lean, I was very unimpressed.   Will I give this place a second chance? After the slow service and uncertain food, you may think not, however I usually give a second chance. I'll let you know what happens next time.  ....Oh, and I don't trust a ramen joint that has Chiffon cake on their menu."}
{"text":"Very good ramen!! One of the best I've ever tried for sure! Price is fair, because I almost couldn't finish my bowl. Place is small tough. Better to arrive earlier. But the quality of the food is spectacular."}
{"text":"We got a bowl of ramen and the takoyaki here. The takoyaki was pretty decent. They don't skimp on the size of bonito flakes. The ramen was good too although I can't say either was anything special. Both were of good size. There are better ramen spots in the city but this is a decent one to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love Touhenboku! Friendly staff, small casual environment and most importantly delicious ramen!! I highly recommend tasting the vegetarian miso ramen, not too be missed!  Great prices means great value. This is our go to spot on Saturdays after swimming or playing squash at the Sheraton hotel, and it's right across from Nathan Phillips Square. Very convenient to go skating at the square and then warm up with some ramen! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Tried many of the downtown ramen places. Got the chicken broth with spice and pork belly. The broth was great, nicely seasoned and tasty. The pork belly was forgettable, but all around a good bowl of ramen. Will be back and will likely order the same."}
{"text":"My new job is close to Touhenboku on Yonge. I was as excited about being close to my favorite ramen place as I was to get my dream job. Eat here every couple of weeks! And each time, I'm blown away by the deliciousness and consistency! They have introduced rewards cards as well. And you can get multiple points for the same bill, i.e. if your order 2 ramens, you get marked twice  unlike a lot of places which give you one mark/reward point per bill!"}
{"text":"I walked by this place at around 6:30pm and it was so crowded which was expected since it had just opened not too long ago.  I didn't realize that I would end up eating here three hours later! It was so refreshing to come in, have a table right away and be greeted by the whole staff with our main waitress smiling.  Compared to other ramen places, this ramen restaurant offers about four types of stock that you can alter its components.   The White (original) has a creamier chicken broth texture. The Red can be adjusted in terms of spice levels by adding chili to your taste level. The Black has a garlic blend sauce in the broth and lastly the Light is like the name suggests, a clear and light chicken broth (not creamy in texture).  All ramen can then have thick or thin noodles, pork belly, pork lean or chicken as a meat choice and lastly sea salt or soya sauce as a soup base. The waitress suggested the sea salt over the soya as a recommendation to our table.  What I love most about this place is that you can see the machine making the ramen noodles on the way to the washroom. It's quite a sight to see!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?  Their different kinds of ramen!!! We ordered the garlic ramen and spicy ramen. If you order the pork soup base then it's $1 more so watch out!! You get to choose whether you want sea salt or soy sauce added, which type of meat whether pork or chicken, and what kind of meat from the pig (ex pork belly or pork shoulder etc). Then you can choose the thickness of the noodle. Seem pretty personable to your desire with every choice you get to choose along the way! Personally I liked the garlic ramen more so than the spicy ramen because I like garlic taste more then spicy taste. The spicy ramen didn't taste any more flavorful than the fact that it's spicy. I wish the soup base was fattier personally because it makes the whole ramen experience more enjoyable with a tastier soup base. The egg could have been done better. I thought it was over cooked for the type of egg it should be that comes with the ramen.   LAST TIP?   They don't have the orange spicy pepper powder that you may get at any other ramen place so when you ask for it, they may give you something totally different; their spicy sauce instead."}
{"text":"I adore this place. I've been going here for the past year and it's always been excellent. Super friendly staff who make sure to say hello and goodbye, excellent ramen and really nice atmosphere. They're the only place in the city that i could find with a veggie broth option. They also have a loyalty card you can complete for a bowl of free ramen!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I saw on twitter that another ramen shop is opening up soon and even more thrilled when I got to attend the Media Preview of Touhenboku Ramen (@touhenbokuRamen) last night. They are officially open today!   Located at 261 Queen W, in my opinion this is probably one of the best location you can choose for a ramen shop. Who wouldn't want to have a comforting hot bowl of ramen after shopping in the area and with only 36 seating, I won't be surprise to see lineups all the time.  Can you believe that they have 450 Arita porcelain bowls custom made in Japan which cost a whopping $50 a piece and as per the owner it is to keep the ramen hot longer. So it is not surprising that they even imported their chopstick from Japan as well.  Unlike most other ramen shops, Touhenboku used chicken broth instead of the traditional pork and their noodles will be freshly made in house daily. Chef Machida also mixed his own flour blend including a special high protein flour for optimal elasticity noodles.   There's 4 types of ramen on their menu : White (original/creamy), Black (garlic), Red (chili) and Light (clear) with the choice of Shio (sea salt) and Sho-yu (soya). Each topped with wood ear mushrooms, half a boiled egg, green onions & nori. Then there's the choice of thin and thick noodles and choice of lean pork, rich pork & chicken chashu.  As per their website:  \"Ramen is more than noodles and soup; it is Japanese soul food. The rich creamy broth is made entirely of chicken and this long, slow process draws out the collagen to create a mizutaki broth that is considerably lighter than the regular tonkotsu (pork bone) with much less fat.\"  I totally agree with the first half but i find their chicken broth heavier and fattier then the pork broth that I am use to, not that it wasn't tasty.  Here they have the white type of ramen which is softer and not as chewy al-dente as the yellow one. And after trying both the thin and thick noodle, we both agrees that the thin one is better. I somehow thought the thick one would be slightly harder/chewier but it was actually doughier. Their recipe is somehow perfect for the thin version.  White $10.50 ~ Original Touhenboku Ramen ~ Ben choose rich pork & sho-yu (soya) for this but I am not sure what the difference between the shio and shoyu since the broth flavor was so intense.  ~ The soup/broth is really thick and on the oily side but extremely flavorful.   Black $10.50 ~ Garlicky Touhenboku Ramen ~ Compare to the Original, the soup here was even thicker/denser which was a bit too heavy on the palette but the bitter aromatic garlic flavor from the Ma-Yu (special blend garlic oil) does add an extra dimension.  Tomo Creampuff $5.50 ~ This is a crisp choux pastry instead of the usual soft airy version  Chiffon Cake $5.50 ~ A super light & spongey texture, this is probably one of the best example of Japanese desserts. Not overly sweet, super delicate and light which you can have after a meal without stuffing yourself (no extra dessert stomach needed here). ~ This was perfect palette cleanser after the heavy broth.  Verdict : ~ Smaller portion compare to other ramen shop but it does fill you up with the thick broth  (guys may need 2 bowls) ~ Definitely love the fact hat they are doing something different to the other ramen shop that's already out there. ~ Great authentic Japanese dessert  ~ Would love to come back to try the spicy ramen and Donburi Rice Bowls. ~ Great Lunch combo options of Ramen+Donburi Rice Bowls for $14 ~ And on a side note, I didn't get to meet their mascot Tomo ;("}
{"text":"Loved the rich and luscious ramen soup  Pros: - Rich Ramen Soup - Cheap price - Good Portions  Cons: - Their donburi (rice dish)  Will come back for more!!"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service. Great quality food. Had a Sapporo on tap and glass was frosted...which was not expected at a place like this. Very reasonable prices and we were full! Great spot."}
{"text":"I had the Pork Garlicky Sea salt broth with thick noodle with pork shoulder. It was flavorful and the broth is creamy because they mix pork fat into the both.  This is this style of ramen, incase if your off put by it. They egg was slices out on top were  bit on the done side for me. They didn't have \"bright orange slightly underdone yokes that I associate with ramen that add richest to the broth. Instead they were solid pale yellow and grainy like when fully cook a egg which is not bad depending what you prefer. The gyoza skin was crispy on one side however the pork filling on the inside was cold in temp, but not raw.  The chickern karage was pretty standard I would say you get at a ramen place. They are definitely a lot better the most places but I'm a toughy =)."}
{"text":"It is a soooo sooo place.not too Amazing in Toronto area you know.too much choice for Asian food.this one is salty."}
{"text":"I've heard a number of horror stories here concerning food poisoning, and after coming here, two of the friends I went with came down with some pretty severe stomachaches. I personally, was fine - and we suspect that the broth choice may have had something to do with it. In our party of five, only two people got stomach pains, both of whom had ordered the 'white' broth.  Black broth is flavorful, perhaps a bit too garlicky. Get the extra noodles - for 50 cents more, you get a much more filling meal. For $12, you can get a bowl of ramen and a Sapporo, which a'int half bad."}
{"text":"I come here every Saturday after playing squash with some buddies. Red spicy with chicken, thin noodles, and an order of gyoza. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A little surprised to see the lackluster reviews here.  Ramen is one of my favorite foods, and I think perhaps Touhenboku's ramen just resonated with me.  I ordered Tonkotsu ramen, which is ??, meaning \"pig bone\".  Basically, pig bone is boiled to make Tonkotsu thick; just on the verge of gelatinous.  That was the ramen I had here.  Thick.  Heavy.  Oily.  Fatty and greasy chatsu.  Wonderful accoutrements.  I was in heaven.  This may have been even better than the ramen place near my home in NYC, Hinomaru.  I just spent a month is Japan and had countless ramen.  I have put on the pounds to prove it.  With the exception of only two Japanese ramen places, this was better than all the other ramen I had in Japan (my Japanese friends are insulted... sorry!)  I never did make it to Santouka before I left for Japan, and that makes me sad.  One day, I'll try it.  However, reading the reviews for Touhenboku, I can see that the other reviewers like a very different ramen than I do.  They don't seem to care for thick, dirty, oily Tonkotsu.  I do, so take my 5 stars with a grain of salt, depending on what kind of ramen you enjoy."}
{"text":"Umame!  The ramen here is some of the most flavourful in Toronto.  The soup broth is always amazing and perfect for a lunch when downtown.  It was also noted that their lunch specials with your options of donburi on rice are a great deal for downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. It was cold so we were excited to be having something warm. It was busy-- the lunch rush but we were seated pretty quickly, given water, menus, etc. If I could, I would give this place zero stars because we didn't actually get to eat anything.  After our waitress gave us water, she never came back. She hurriedly sat other diners, gave them water and proceeded to take every other group's orders (people who were seated well after us). She kept walking away quickly after taking orders and for about ten minutes never came to our side of the restaurant. We could see people who just sat down placing their orders and a couple eventually got seated right next to us. Finally, after another 5 or so minutes she came to our side and then took the couples order next to us, who hadn't been there for more than a few minutes! We just got up and left. If it was multiple waitresses working, I would understand confusion but she knew we hadn't ordered or at least forgot.  It's a shame. We got to see everyone else's food and it looked really good. I doubt I'll be coming back because of this bad first impression. We got to go back into the cold and got a cheeseburger as our lunch hour was now over...One of my worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"When I think of great ramen places, not many come to mind, its a bit of a niche restaurant for me personally. I have to be in the mood, in the area of a place to try, and not craving anything else.  such is the case when I was on vacation and I was, in the area and thought, now is the time to try it. located pretty much in transit heaven this location is pretty awesome, from a food standpoint and from a pride standpoint(they have annual floats in the pride parade, which is pretty much the only reason I knew about this place) walked in and was instantly sat down with a menu and I was on my way to ramen heaven, the menu is a bit confusing in how to go about doing up a ramen dish, my complaint is that it doesn't flow very well, I had to ask for help and still wasn't very confident in ordering. my waiter was top notch in helping me out through this process. my waiter was pretty adamant on telling me I was ordering too much food (two ramen bowls and a app) but I told him not to worry, as this was my first meal of the day at 3pm. my app was the Takoyaki(octopus), it was decent, I wasn't very impressed with the flakes sprinkled on the balls? when it hit my mouth, my whole mouth went dry, but very good. my mains were a spicy red meat lovers pork ramen, and a black garlic flavored pork ramen, both with udon noodles(personal favorite, see photos) it was fresh and it was delicious.  I was very happy with my experience at this fine establishment, the food was super fresh and fairly quick from time of ordering till the food hit the table. I would 100% come back in the future, just a heads up on that menu, cause it made me feel pretty dumb.  transit options are 501/502 streetcar, and Osgoode subway station. parking is not really a nice direct option, a couple of lots are within walking distance, or side street parking.  if you are in the area, definitely try it out."}
