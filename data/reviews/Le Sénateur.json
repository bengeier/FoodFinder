{"text":"I used to believe that it was impossible to find a bad meal in old Montreal.   Not any more.    The food here is over-priced and bland at best.     On the plus side, all the other restaurants in the area were crowded, while this one was empty.    That should have been a sign for us.    

If you're looking for low key and good domestic bottled beer then this place fits the bill.   Otherwise keep walking."}
{"text":"Took over an hour to receive our drinks and the waiter forgot half of them and never came back. Soup was still half frozen, steak was overcooked. They give condiments in disposable containers. Far from a classy place at that price. Stay away from that place."}
{"text":"Came here with dad on a vacation tour. Started with the complimentary bread and butter. We both got duck, which was filling and good. Vegetables were a bit bland, and rice was alright. Portion sizes were generous. They also proceeded to serve red and white wine to people on the tour. I had the white wine which was good. Sipped on the red which was also good. Waiters were friendly and attentive. Tiramisu dessert was alright. Most people on the tour did not speak English, but waiters were accommodating. 
Overall, I'd say this restaurant was above average but nothing standing out besides the service to bring back repeat customers. Also the tables felt a bit cramped, filled a bit too full for the small space, for people to walk by. Everything felt a little cramped and dark without enough lighting, even the bathrooms."}
{"text":"They were very attentive and relatively quick, even with a full dinning room.  The  portions were nice sized and flavorful."}
{"text":"We came here on a tour,  ambiance nice,  but it should be rated as italian not French.   The pasta was better than the duck. 

Do not go unless you have a good friend who can laugh along with u on all the items."}
{"text":"The food was average. I order the chicken, and it was moist, but there was no flavor. I was disappointed because the ambiance was very fancy, so I expected for from the food. As for the service, the waiters were pretty nice."}
{"text":"Loveeee their lamb leg. The meat was so well done. It came of easily like I was ripping paper. Extremely happy that my tourist recommend me this. I would recommend this to others as well. My friends was so fancy about the salmon since it was to burnt. Others include their soup and bread on the side. I also order snails, which was already in sauce topped with mushroom~decent. Lastly it's their Tiramisu cake for desserts, pretty good."}
{"text":"We had the prize fixe dinner for 22.5. It was nothing special but worth the money. You get 5-6 choices of an entree, salad, bread, coffee, with a desert. I had the salmon and my friend had the steak and fries. The salmon came with rice and some steamed vegetables. The steak was asked to me medium it was closer to well done. They have a limited selection of beers. The service was good. You should dine outside. The inside is nothing special. If you are looking for a romantic or great dining experience you should go some place else."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! My family and I are on a group tour. We paid and ordered our food in advance. All the medium-rare steaks that we ordered came out very very well done. Our waiter never bothered to check up on us even though we tried to get his attention about the food temperature. 

Anyways, he dropped our check for our drinks (which we payed separately) and for some reason, our check that we still needed to tip/pay an additional \"$6.11\" on $44.79. This was added on in writing by the way. We asked for an explanation for this because we already included a very nice tip with our meal. Overall, it escalated and he continued to yell at us. We just paid the $44.79 and left. Needless to say they were trying to scam us."}
{"text":"there is one other review of le senateur, but I ate at another restaurant with the same name but address is 24 rue saint-paul, vieux-montreal


I was with a family of 10 and finding a table at the cute little restaurants is impossible.  Also, I wanted a broad, fairly priced menu.  This restaurant fit the bill on all accounts.   The best lobster bisque and filet mignon.  They had a prix fix menu for $26 which was excellent.  Included options of the filet mignon, pasta, etc.  

If ever in montreal again, would definitely seek this place out."}
{"text":"5/11/2015 254 rue Saint-Paul est, my girlfriend & I were haggled by a young lady at the door tantalizing us with the menu that has large colored pictures of what looked like an impressive quality. We were looking for a place to eat and thought why nor give them a try; DISAPPOINTED! I ordered the jarred d'agneau (lamb shank) and my girlfriend ordered the Homard et Filet Mignon (lobster and filet mignon). The lamb shank was dry and the gravy too salty. The lobster was not fresh and the stuffing didn't do a good job covering the stale taste. The filet mignon was ok at best. The waiter, who refused to write our order down, forgot to get the ice tea and had to remind him. He also forgot to get my second glass of wine after he asked if I wanted another one and I said yes!. It's no wonder they need a girl outside the door haggling people inside. This place needs new owners who appreciate food, service, and value."}
{"text":"One thing you will learn about Montreal (especially the downtown area) is that if there is a particular place you want to dine, and they take reservations; do it, otherwise be prepared to be informed that your wait time will be at least an hour. 
There wasn't a wait at all to dine at Le Senateur, but it was pretty packed and it was late, and we were hungry, plus they had a decent looking pre-fix menu that included soup or salad, entree and dessert with coffee; that seemed like a solid deal.

The service here was excellent, our waiter was incredibly charming and even gave us the carafe of house wine for half price due to a minor mix up.
I think the issue I keep coming back to is that the food quality just didn't seem to be there.

I'll start with the rolls that arrived at the table: cold, and obviously store bought which would have been fine if they would have at least been toasted for a few minutes. I didn't even finish mine and waited for the actual food to arrive.
I ordered from the prefix menu and got the salad to start, mussels in wine sauce as my entree, it came with frittes (fries). The salad was extremely average and definitely a store bought dressing to go along with it. The wine sauce that accompanied my mussels had great flavor and I happily dipped my fries into it. The fries by the way were stellar as I always seem to find with any fry I have encountered in Montreal. However, I feel like the mussels themselves were not washed properly, or as well as I like to when I personally make them at home, they were however still edible and I enjoyed them.
My father said his steak was just ok, and mom said the same thing about her salmon and rice with vegetables. 

Our prefix meal ended with coffee and dessert, we passed on the coffee but we each got something different for dessert. I got the chocolate profiteroles, mom got tiramisu, and dad got a fruit salad. The fruit salad by the way was out of a can, yup; and boy did we make jokes about that! I mean come on, how is a patron going to take you seriously if you feed them food out of a can? Everything else was just ok. It seems like there was nothing really outstanding to be had here unfortunately. 

The prefix meals are a great idea and I think if some more attention to minor details were put in place, Le Senateur would be great, and please; nix the fruit out of a can."}
{"text":"I, too, was fooled by the \"tantalizing\" hostess waving the menu outside the restaurant. My wife ordered the \"so called\" fresh grilled salmon. Only to realize that it did not come fresh from the atlantic, but from a frozen dark freezer! It was hard and tough!!! Even the  \"savory\" white butter sauce did not save it! DO NOT ORDER PLEASE! And upon complaining, the server who looked like general swatzcoff from the gulf war gave me a shoulder shrug and said, \"i'll tell the chef\" WTF! Ohh not to mention, the fresh cream puff dessert was probably from the freezer of costco topped with fake hazelnut chocolate sauce! NUFF SAID!"}
