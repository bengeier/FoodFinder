{"text":"A typical hole-in-a-wall generic chinese/thai food joint.   It was close to one of my customer's sites and I was in a hurry and in no mood to drive anywhere else so I decided to check this place. ... ordered shrimp in lobster sauce lunch special.  + good size portion + loaded with fresh vegetables + very friendly service + ... all for little more than $6 (no drink) + simple but very clean interior"}
{"text":"I have visited her from time to time over the years.  I recommend staying the chinese items on the menus.  I have tried the Thai recently because I really wanted some Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai was not what I expected as they use a much larger noodle then what is normally expected.  Gone are the little hawaiian items they used to offer.  The staff is friendly and the chow while basic will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Their chow mein and fried rice are sooooo delicious! Wish I could get them in half portions because the portion size is HUGE (!!!) and sometimes I only want just a little to satisfy my craving, not enough to live on for 3 days.  I also highly recommend the walnut shrimp.  The staff has always been excellent and super friendly.  I didn't give it 5 stars because every time I go here I always think \"DANG that was expensive\" but I guess for the portion size it's about right. Like I said, if they offered a half portion of fried rice and chow mein for half the price, I'd be a happy camper."}
{"text":"Hey Chinese cook guy,  please don't hot wok my Kalbi, and Hawaiian style teriyaki beef, and chicken.     I understand you can whip up a good orange chicken, and beef broccoli, but don't venture into Hawaiian style  bbq if you can't pull it off...it's like eating candy, if I wanted my Kalbi to be that sweet, I would breakout a bag of sugar.     You're chinese lunch specials are a great value, but please stop asking me to buy another Hawaiian BBQ plate.    If you notice, I haven't bought another BBQ plate since then.     Just tell me about your other lunch specials, and I would be totally cool with you."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom to order take out because she really likes this place. I already have a place to eat Chinese, but she was driving. The place was clean. They have pictures of food up, but I couldn't tell what any of them were.   The service was good. I had a Sprite from the fountain, or what I thought was a Sprite. When I took a sip it was not Sprite. I told the guy at the counter and he said ok and made no effort to check the machine. Then I tried the Lemonade. That was water. When I went to pour it out, there were floaties of I don't know what in my cup. I sat down thinking they would get to the machine, but they didn't.   They have lunch specials that go till 4p.  Unfortunately, we had gone in the evening, so I'm not sure of the portions they serve, but their prices are reasonable and about the same as other restaraunts.   I had Udon soup which was good. At the same time unappetizing because I kept thinking about the machine. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but first impression is key."}
{"text":"it is one of those Americanized Chinese food take-out place, so you know what to expect, I saw a lot of good review, so i gave a try, unfortunately,the food is not what real Chinese will like, probably it is because there are not many Chinese people living in henderson."}
{"text":"We were looking for something quick for dinner and realized there just aren't many Chinese food restaurants in the area.  We'd already tried our closest one and wanted to try something different.  Then we remember Wok In Express on Gibson.    Went on a week night and the restaurant was empty.  Nothing special looking, but there are a lot of dine-in tables, which is surprising for your typical chinese food joint.   I placed my order while my husband was still mulling over what to get.  He orders a teriyaki bowl and the man shakes his head no.  For a second we were wondering what this meant.  \"No\", as in \"we can't order that\"?  Finally he says, \"I can't let you order japanese food at a chinese restaurant.  I have to have it on the menu but it's just not as good.\"  This was puzzling.  I mean, why have something on the menu that you don't want to serve?  Still, my husband appreciated his honesty and opted for beef and broccoli instead.  The man threw in 2 veggie egg rolls and I got a free fountain soda for checking in.    The food was ready quickly and the portions were large.  We both enjoyed our meals and especially loved the chicken fried rice!  The prices were OK.  I liked that they marked the takeout boxes to let us know which was which.  We'll definitely return when we're in the mood for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  They have great combination meals.  The fresh and crisp taste of the snap peas assures you that they just made your food when you ordered it.  I am one of those people who goes in to pick up my food and doesn't like to wait for delivery.  They are fast and efficient, even if you walk in and order!"}
