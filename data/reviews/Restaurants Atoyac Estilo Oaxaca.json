{"text":"Great service. I highly recommend this place.
Homemade Tortillas!!! The atmosphere is perfect for me and my girl too."}
{"text":"Street tacos!!! My favorite thing of all time and they are amazing here!!! The corn quesadilla is unique and delicious. The fish tacos, pastor tacos and asada tacos were nothing short of amazing. Also, it's cheap, $2.25 for fish and $1.50 for asada and pastor. The service was very friendly. This place will be in my taco shop repertoire for sure ."}
{"text":"If you want good food and don't want to spend a lot of money this is your place.  Everything that I have tried has been delicious!  Individual items are smaller so you can try a few things and not feel guilty.  The horchata and churros are amazing too so make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in Phoenix.  Fish, pastor, steak, awfully good."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican in Phoenix. The al pastor burro is awesome. If you really wanna go crazy, ask for an all pastor quesaburro."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Pablo is back. The food is even more delicious than before. I didn't think it was possible. This is the best taco place in town. Fish tacos are amazing, crispy quesadillas are delicious and the horchata is the perfect drink."}
{"text":"Great first experience with a quick lunch today. I grabbed a Asada and Fish taco, a side of beans, and a horchata. Lunch was served fast less than 5 minutes and the sides of grilled onion and fried pepper along with the two salsas were spot on. 

The horchata included smal pieces if cantaloupe and pecans. nice version.

I'm not sure what I would change. I guess this is a case where I can just enjoy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong for tacos and burros from this place.  Reasonable prices, well-seasoned food.  Don't be fooled by the location/outward appearance.  Try the spicy burro."}
{"text":"If you're just driving past, you would never know how amazing this place is. Don't judge a book by its cover, this place is absolutely fantastic. Love the fish burrito, carne asada everything, and of course, the onions and lime. Yuuuuum. This place is a favorite lunch spot for my whole family."}
{"text":"Really good fish tacos and carne asada. Drink selection limited and sketchy location."}
{"text":"I only frequent two Mexican restaurants in PHX and this is one of them. I dont understand how out of all the reviews no one has ever mentioned the tlayudas......this is what this place excels at. Its a Oaxacan staple that no one outside of Mexico has ever heard about. Go eat your tlayuda, dont thank me. Its that good."}
{"text":"Been here several times and it's always a delight. The street tacos and burros are delicious and they do a good job of getting the food out pretty quick."}
{"text":"The best! Our favorite Mexican Food in Phoenix. I love the torta milanesa....it's outstanding. The Horchata is out of this world. You always walk out of there under $10 bucks. It's a hole in the wall but the best one in the valley!"}
{"text":"This is bar none my favorite taco shop ever I loved the previous establishment and this new addition is also fantastic!
I love the fish taco and Pastor the most but really you can't go wrong! $1.25 tacos is a great value for the contrast in flavor you receive. $2.00 for the fish is well worth this lovely taco and it delivers with fresh cabbage and the creamy sauce that always makes or breaks a fish taco for me.
The place is a hole in the wall but that just makes the charm of this taco shop that much better IMO."}
{"text":"Food was good specially when they serve onion and chili on the side for your tacos. Also had a tamal it was good."}
{"text":"Dont know why I never reviewed this place.
It was one of our go to Mexican food spots for probably my last 3 yrs before moving away from Phoenix. Their was a group of us 5 but at times it was 4. And every one of us enjoyed eating at Restaurant Atoyac Estillo Oxaca.
My self and one of my friends would always order malalitas(not sure if I'm spelling it correctly) essentially they are sopes. We would always request that they not deep fry them. I would get vegan and my friend chicken. They were made fresh to order. They were fine nothing extrodinary. On mines the had black beans and onion. I would also oder a side of nopale. Which was one whole cactus leaf. Here again I would request it be cooked on the grill; other wise they would deep fry it.

Their salsas are good with some variety
The lady or man depending on  the day all knew us as we became regulars. They make tamales also. One of our group would regularly order 1 or 2 dozen chicken tamales.
He really liked their tamales.
One thing I always wished was that they would have made this corn tortillas fresh. 
But all and all this was a good place with quality food, that all of us liked
I'm sorry I never took photos of us all eating here. It would have been nice to remember
And now 2 of that group have passed on."}
{"text":"I'm moving in!!! Shrimp tacos, fish burrito, al pastor (pork) burrito, carne asada, black beans and hor-chata. Hip hip hooray! No failures in this meal. Oh and they are really nice.  I will be a regular if they don't let me move in."}
{"text":"Great selection of taco offerings and other Mexican food. When I can't have my mom's home cooking, a meal from Tacos Atoyac is a welcome sight. They also have awesome horchata. Take it from the son of parents that used to own a Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place almost looks scarey, but they have the best tacos EVER!!! Great authentic food for great prices!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was delicious. I ordered 2 asada tacos which were the tacos of the day. Can't be tacos for $1.50. They were very tiny. Could have easily had 5 to 7. I'll come back, will probably try something other than tacos."}
{"text":"It's good to have this restaurant back. The menu is pretty much the same as before. The tacos are still inexpensive and very good, and the fried onions and jalapeno served on the side are a really nice touch; and they have the best horchata I've had in Phoenix. The counter area may seem cluttered with cases of soda, but the rest of the restaurant is orderly and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Had passed by by this place a couple of times and I would mention to my boyfriend we should try that place. So today we went in and... 
I ordered your so-called crujientes/crispy tacos. It was a sorry shell. Taco Bell has better shells. Shit I make better crujientes/tacos dorados. You guys use the lettuce, tomato as a filler and sprinkle shit for what you call carne asada. AND you cut it up finely. When I asked what kind of cheese you add to them they replied with \"NACHO CHEESE\"!!! That's a NO NO!!! Taco Bell adds nacho cheese to their food. 
The agua de mango was delicious thats why they get one star."}
{"text":"Definitely fits the title of a dive restaurant. However, all I can say is be prepared for deliciousness. This place has the tastiest tacos that are so full of flavor. Simple concept of your standard street taco, but absolutely amazing. Big flavors that punch you in the face and have you coming back for more. The owners are always so friendly and your food is always guaranteed made fresh. Definitely stop by if you're in the area and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Don't let the looks of this place turn you away, great food, even better staff. Well worth the money, the food was outstanding. Wife had fish and shrimp tacos, kid had carne asada tacos, and I had a meat trio torta....... we all loved it. Super cool little dive , hole in the wall. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Before the fateful day in late March when Tacos Atoyac shut down, I lamented mostly the loss of their excellent fish tacos. Some of their other tacos weren't the best I've had, but they had the best fish tacos anywhere. So when I heard they had opened back up, of course I was excited.

My return visit came with some trepidation, of course. I heard Dan was no longer involved, and Dan was part of the experience.  The food should be the same, right? Same menu, same prices.

I got a smattering of what I consider the best offerings the previous incarnation offered: two fish tacos, a quesadilla with lengua, and the churro.

The quality of the tacos did not decline at all. I could've sworn they used to have more fish in them, however. Was I just imagining things? I don't know, it's hard to quantitatively compare something to a mere fading memory. But the fish tacos are still undoubtedly good.

The quesadillas, however, provided considerably more insight. Atoyac v1 quesadillas were packed with meat and cheese - so much that if you get the lengua quesadillas, you have a substantial pool of (delicious) grease sitting at the bottom of the tray. These things were so overflowing that it was sometimes hard to pick them up without the meat falling out.  Now? Barely any cheese OR meat. The meat was actually scattered around the quesadilla, with areas completely devoid of meat! And the cheese was spread extremely thin compared to the old quesadillas.

It's clear that what happened here is what is known as size inflation (as opposed to price inflation).  They raise the price by lowering the portions. And that just makes for worse food - give me the same food at a higher price, if you must.

Apart from the disappointing cheapening of the product, this place also lacks any charm at all without Dan's presence. And that goes a long way, too."}
{"text":"One of THEE best street tacos in Phoenix! Carne Asada, tripa, shrimp, lengua, and fish tacos are ALL mouth watering! Horchata is delicious, they give you the option of melon and walnuts. Very cheap and affordable."}
{"text":"I dropped in today for a quesadilla, some chicken tacos, a burrito, and an horchata drink.

This is a great little place. The prices are average, and the cuisine is above average. The area is a bit sketchy, but the restaurant has ample seating, and it is clean.

I'd recommend it for anyone seeking authentic southern Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wow... Honestly this is the best taco place I've tried here in AZ. I had ordered two of every taco and they were all delicious! It was also my first time trying Cabeza taco... And it's definitely one of my new favorite! The al pastor was sweet and had like a honey glazed on it which I liked a lot!  I would recommend and definitely come back!"}
{"text":"These are the BEST street tacos that I have been able to find. This is the first place that I have found in somewhat north Phoenix that has that authentic taste. Very good.!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good carne asada tacos at a great price.  I like their horchata as well, which comes with melon and pecans."}
{"text":"Amazing. I was really sad when the original restaurant broke up but this is exactly the same. Try everything, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"11/11/16
I came here for the fish tacos off of an article I read on line which had this listed as the best taco spot in AZ. I ordered 2 fish tacos, 1 shrimp taco and an order of churros. 

Churros - 2 stars 
Jack in the box still has the best churros ?

Fish tacos - 2 1/2 stars 

Shrimp tacos - 4 stars"}
{"text":"Excellent! Pretty simplistic tacos but they are bomb for the price. The place looks kinda sketchy and when I was there even the front door was broken. I had a asada taco and al pastor which were both excellent. I also tried the fish taco-not as good as fuzzys but it hit everything that I was craving. The flavours are pretty on point. With everything. My boyfriend go a burro too and he loved that. Unfortunately the horchata was out when we were there but I will definitely come back here again!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place, and finally decided to give the new place a try. Ordered fish and chorizo tacos to go. 
First negative: was reluctantly greeted by a teenager girl. Didn't even acknowledge me until a guy she was talking to pointed to me, she then finally greeted me. Definitely miss the warm greeting of the tall bald guy! 
The fish tacos were decent, the fish was more oily then I prefer. The chorizo tacos were horrible, to be honest. It was salty and had an unappetizing flavor. I hope it was an off night.. I'll try again in a year (if still around)."}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed with this place. Given the overwhelming positive reviews I was really looking forward to trying this place.
Let me begin with the fact that it was unbelievably hot inside, they had small mini AC which didn't really worked. When I finished eating I looked like I just came out of a sauna.

Now let's talk about the reason why I traveled 35 minutes to try this place, THE FOOD. The tacos are CHEAP, they are of the small street variety and most of them are ~$1.50. I had the shrimp, carne asada, cabeza and pastor tacos which all of them were pretty flavorful. The pastor was pretty dry for my taste and also looked old (I went on a Tuesday). Something that really bothered me (besides the fact that there was no real AC) was the fact that all the tacos and quesadilla had barely any meat on them, the shrimp taco had literally two small shrimps or just as my Mexican friend who I was with said \"Son bien poquiteros\" which means they REALLY skimp on the amount of meat they put inside the tacos.

I will not rush to come back but I'll try them again in the future, hopefully this time doesn't feel like a sauna inside."}
{"text":"I jumped up and down when I found out Atoyac reopened! I ordered carne asada, fish, and AL pastor tacos with a molote and a churro. The al pastor here used to be amazing and it's still good. The carne asada and fish tacos were okay just not memorable. I felt like they were a little stingy with the salsa. Skip the molote if you ever come here. Definitely order a churro if you know what's good for you. I'd come here more often if I lived closer it beats Filibertos but I won't go out of my way to eat here. It's just not the same!"}
{"text":"Get the burritos, do NOT get rice or beans. I highly recommend this place for take out. Kind of a dive, shares parking w/smoke shop and I can imagine it being one stop shopping for stoners, but seriously, get the burritos."}
{"text":"No coman menudo ni tlayuda  esta muy mal preparado si eres de oaxaca sabras como es la comida oaxaqueña  los molotes son pura masa sin sabor y pesimamente fritos este restaurant no tiene ni idea de como preparar comida oaxaqueña demasiado caro para un restaurant de media estrella"}
{"text":"Every week, rain or shine we come in for the fish tacos and shrimp burrito. Amazing! Their molé is also excellent. Great food, nice staff, cheap eats."}
{"text":"Love their chicken burros and quesadillas. They're definitely under-the-radar (not the world's best location), but certainly a tasty, quick place for take-out."}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  Best tacos I have had in a very long time.  Real ly nice service too. It's nice to order and get friendly responsed. They have diet coke cans"}
{"text":"The molotes are totally amazing. We also had fish tacos, which were battered, fried perfection. Served crispy and hot. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of enjoying both past and present Atoyac installations. One thing remains constant, the amazing street tacos. Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca could be described as a \"hole in the wall\" establishment, but don't allow this to deter you. Atoyac is neither flashy or extravagant, but simple Oaxacan style grub done right (without destroying your wallet).

All of their taco options are delightful, especially their tacos de pescado, al pastor, and carne asade. Love the additional grilled onions, peppers, and salsa that accompany most items. Their tlayuda is not a bad option either if you plan to share.

Bottomline, Tacos Atoyac has remained one of my favorite taco joints in the valley over the years."}
{"text":"It really doesn't get better, the fish tacos are to die for. Make sure you get the onions and jalapeños on the side. Owner is in the back cooking, always a friends place, locations is getting better."}
{"text":"Jenny and I hit up RAEO because we recently moved to the area so we just MUST try the local food joints. I typically prefer to cheat east, not west, of our place but when you're talking about good mexican food in a little hole in the wall next to a tobacco shop in a we buy gold shopping center, you're going to have to give up on location (doubt they are planning to expand into Kierland or anything). I do wish they were open later but, as I pointed out about the location, I can't fault them for their hours.

Anyways, the food is good and the service is legit. We haven't decided yet if it will be our new \"bring out of town visitors here for the good mexican food that is near our place\" mostly because of the ambience. It's great for me, fine for Jenny when she's really in the mood for good mexican, but you know how visitors get. Maybe we'll take our most casual friends -- definitely not a place to meet the parents for the first time. 

Recommend the hot dogs and you can't go wrong with any of the tacos. Fish tacos here are better than most places but their carne asada is great for those of you who like to play it safe with a classic order."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying my family is from Oaxaca and I am first generation American.

The previous owner of this place obviously held this restaurant to a higher standard when he was part of the ownership. His food was delicious. enough said. meat was always juicy and tasty. the most important trait, however, was that it was AUTHENTIC and spot on to food from Oaxaca. 

I really hope the new ownership either greatly improves the quality of its food, or takes the \"estilo Oaxaca\" off of its name. This is Not food from Oaxaca. 

Dan, wherever you are, please teach these guys how to properly make tacos al pastor and a tasty Tlayuda!"}
{"text":"Real street tacos - $1.90 each.  Very tasty and filling.  Glass bottle drinks are a nice touch!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's delicious, and it's delicious. Also, it's delicious. I can't really elaborate beyond these points, but if you're a Phoenix native, you must go here for tacos. Simply must.

Also, try the memelitas! :D"}
{"text":"Jeff and I were excited to give this place a try after hearing it had re-opened. We loved their beef tacos and menudo prior to the temporry closing. We had just finished hiking at Piestwea and were both very hungry. Jeff and I both loved the lengua tacos. They were juicy and with plenty of meat. The cabeza tacos had good flavor but were a little dry and bit too greasy. I didn't like the pastor tacos and neither did Jeff. They were unusually sweet for my liking and I didn't care for the texture of the meat. Finally, I ordered a large menudo and loved everything about this delicious red stew, except for the fact that it was a bit too greasy this time. I've had plenty of menudo and I know there are ways to take some of the fat out so it's not so heavy. The tortillas served on the side were very good. The service was good and speedy but they weren't busy either. We def don't think it's as good as before, but, considering how hard it is to find good authentic Mexican food in Az, I give the new Atoyac a slightly above average rating."}
{"text":"Best Nacho's in Phoenix. This is the go to Mexican place in town. The tacos are pretty small, but they are cheap which makes up for it. Very friendly staff, great cooks, all around amazing food."}
{"text":"Whoah, SUCH A GOOD FIND. Right up there with the best Mexican I've had in Arizona. Everything I've ever had.... And I've had everything has been amazing. The staff is always super nice too. The pastor is the absolute best! Their taco salad is even ridiculous, everything is so fresh. Check out this whole in the wall spot ASAP!"}
{"text":"For awhile I was a regular customer. Ordering the Shrimp Tacos and Pork street tacos. For some reason the Spanish word eludes me. The sauce of the shrimp tacos was the best. I loved that they offered grilled onions and peppers. With the guacamole hot sauce it was very delicious.

I finally went back recently, they had a couple new lady employees who were nice. The food was made quickly and I took it to-go.

When I got home, the shrimp tacos just didn't look appetizing, the sauce was thin and very little cabbage.

I also ordered the two different tamales they offered. The chicken was more masa than meat. The beef was better. A good thing I like masa becuase it wasn't good but it was just above \"egh\". I don't know what happend, maybe it was just an off day, but it wasn't the same it used to be."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Sketchy part of town however, don't let that distract you. The fish tacos are the best. The kids plate is gray also - chicken, beans and rice. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I often feed into the hype and end up extremely disappointed. Not this time! Some of the best food I've had in awhile, not just Mexican food, food period!

I had the fish and carne tacos, my husband had the mexican hotdog. Everything tastes fresh and flavorful! Cute little place to sit and just be you, in other words no need to dress up. Perfect for an after school snack or the last stop on your way home to pick up dinner! Love this place! I'm a first timer, turned lifer."}
{"text":"This is the best fish taco ever for me!
We tried San Diego famous fish taco and other fish taco but it's the best fish taco ever. They also serve great Horchata! You should try that too!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really miss Dan! The food is pretty much the same. I had the fish taco's and they were not as good as before. The tortilla was a lttle firmer, the fish was a bit smaller, the Chipotle mayo not as flavorful, neither were the salsa's for that matter. 

The service was slower and not as friendly. The cashier asked me \"if that was it\" after each item also she is difficult to understand. Not as big of a fan as I once was."}
{"text":"No hay ninguna cosa en todo México que se llama \"perro caliente.\"  Especialmente en el estado de Oaxaca.  En que exactamente están pensando ustedes?  My previous review still stands.  Thank God Dan is gone.    All the other reviewers . . . don't gush about things of which you have no personal knowledge or experience.  Like when I go into pizza joints en Michoacán o Guerrero and the Mexican nationals tell me that this is the \"best pizza in the world\" and it is \"just like NY or Chicago.\"  Uh, no it isn't, and you don't have room to judge or gush.  And if you don't understand what I wrote above, you REALLY don't have room to judge . . . either me, or the menu, or the taste/quality of the food.  Best of luck to the new owners/management (?) but to anyone who hasn't been here . . . don't believe the Yelp hype, because that is all it is . . . hype from people who think they know better but really don't.  If you really want good tacos (that will actually fill you up at a decent price) go to one of the many Los Favoritos locations across the valley."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I go here at least twice a week. The owner is really nice and always comes out to say hi. I also appreciate when the kind girl remembers you and what you ordered last. It's a place to get a great lunch, dinner or even have tacos for breakfast! Have you done that? I have done that here, its the best here. 

FYI: DONT use the restroom. It looks like the building is crying. I think it might be from a leaking pipe. It isn't a sign of the quality of food."}
{"text":"Best Tripa tacos in town!! Super clean meat ,green avocado salsa it's delicious!! The establishment it's very clean."}
{"text":"This review is base on the food only.  The carne asada plate with chorizo was outstanding.  Great black beans on the side.  So fresh and ready in 8 minutes when I was there at 3pm.  I recommend take out.  This review is only for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great street tacos! The chicken tacos are fabulous. Even better are the fish Tacos. The service was fast and the price wasn't too bad. Definitely a place to go for good tacos.
 
Taco Tuesdays offer $1 Chicken or Pastor Tacos."}
{"text":"Buried Treasure

Urban lore often directs one to look among the rubble of dubious boroughs for the finest of flavor.  People have likely driven by Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca for years, without stopping, overlooking this diamond in the rough.  I had.  Having won the Phoenix New Times Best \"Rising From the Ashes\" Award; there is more than meets the eye to this otherwise humble establishment.

Just beyond the rush hour traffic lay explosions of flavor in fish, al pastor, chorizo, and mole tacos.  Heading back to the counter for seconds; the shrimp, carne asada, and chicken tacos reverberate the same savory blasts.  Excavate through the ice that once chilled some of the finest horchata in the valley and resurrect the remains of cantaloupe and pecan.

Regardless of opinions on the curb appeal, the inside is always clean, inviting, and pleasant; indoor and patio seating.  The striking young lady at the counter is friendly and accommodating; offering onions, peppers, and sauces.  Accept them, then find a place to sit with safety straps; it's about to get exciting."}
{"text":"Terrible name, great tacos.... You would never stop here if it weren't for the great reviews.  It went through some new ownership but the food is the same which is GREAT!  I have to order 4 tacos pastor each time because they are pretty much like crack cocaine for me.  I have tried a few other items here and although they are good I always go back to the pastor tacos.  This is a tiny place next door to the 7-11 and you will probably drive by this place because it is so small and there is not much parking so be careful when you go here.  Do yourself a favor and stop here for some tacos, they are small but are phenominal!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the restaurant formerly known as Tacos Atoyac for a few years (a couple months after it opened) and have seen it go from strength to strength.

Needless to say I was a little apprehensive about returning knowing Dan is gone. As some people have mentioned he did a great job of making you feel welcomed.

Fortunately, the food is still fantastic. I had my usual; a fish taco, a carne asada memelita and an all pastor burro. It was perfect.

Yes it's a bummer that Dan is gone but don't be afraid to go back. It's as good as ever!"}
{"text":"My cousin took my son here who loved it so much he kept begging us to take him back and boy are we glad we did. 

The general area is a little shady and the building has seen way better days but the food is so good. We usually order the tacos which run about $2.00 each and are small. I can eat 3, my son can eat 6. My husband had the Mexican hot dog and swears that its the best one he has ever had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow what a difference. Cashier was super fucking rude. Food was very good but not excellent. Cashier cheerily told me Dan was no longer involved, guess that was the biker looking white guy. So after ordering, mid-sentence, cashier orders me to go sit down and wait for my order. Super rude, and why? She thinks I'm hitting on her because I'm polite and chatty. Hate to break it to you, but the sexy Latinas are the ones that don't look like mole people who got creative with their eyebrows. I drove all the way from Surprise for worse food than before and major attitude from a mole lady. Won't happen again."}
{"text":"I miss Dan. I didn't go all that often, but when I did Dan always knew my order. It's nice feeling like a regular, he made me feel at home.

That being said, the fish tacos are still the best and I will continue to go."}
{"text":"A solid spot for Mexican that's a cut above many other restaurants. When you walk in, you see an open, modest kitchen and a plain seating area. You're not here for the scenery, you're here to shove some tacos in your face!

Here's what I tried: 

Horchata: Not often I see little cubes of cantaloupe and pecans in this beverage. Very sweet and enjoyable, but I'm accustomed to a bit more of a kick in mine...like nutmeg or something. I was also disappointed that while the menu said \"aguas\", this is the only one they have. No melon, pineapple, tamarind, or hibiscus tea. Bummer. At least it was only $1.80

Fish tacos: batter was pretty bland, and the smidgen chipotle mayo didn't help much. My dining companion actually added salt to this! Definitely needed to get bailed out by the grilled onions to taste complete.

Burro al pastor: A tad bit on the sweet side for me, but the grilled serranos sure did make this good. It was a solid, heavy burrito that was more filling than it looked. 

Overall, this is a very inexpensive place with tons of options. I'll be back to try something new like the carne asada and chorizo burrito, or maybe see what their quesadillas are all about. I like my Mexican to have a little more of a kick, but the sides and salsa can remedy that. I'd definitely go here over the --bertos in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for cheap street tacos that happen to be awesome! Don't judge the book by its cover or you will miss out!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are delicious!!! We tried the spicy taco with carne asada for the first time...so yummy!!!
Make sure to get a side of onions and jalepenos!! However our total tab was $36.
10 tacos, 2 sodas, side of rice and beans."}
{"text":"This review is for the NEW reincarnation of Tacos Atoyac. Having known from some sources that it opened yesterday, I had to do some investigation on my favorite taco joint's abrupt closure and what this next stage is all about.

Arrived shortly after 11:00 a.m., there was a already a queue. Looks like a lot of you are lurking though the Yelp Talk threads.  Word comes around fast especially with cheap, good food.  First. I looked at the menu. What? That's the same as TA Version 1.0. plus/minus a few items. Conspicuously absent upfront was my main man Dan, yes the BIG dude that usually addresses moi as the Duke.  I'm reserving my praise for the guy for my next review of the old TA version 1.0 later. I looked at the guys at the back, they were the same guys who were cooking there before. The lady cashier, she too used to work here before. Beware, she's a little light on English so be patient (I saw a wanted sign on the door that should address this issue).

Having eaten a heavy breakfast an hour earlier, I just ordered 2 carne asada, 1 pastor and a quesadilla de epazote + a Mexican coke.  I figured this should be a good litmus test of what this place is compared to the original. I was then given a number, that's a first.

10 minutes later, my food came. Well it looked like how it was before - came with 2 kinds of salsa (chipotle + the guacamole based) + the sautéed onions with a slice of lemon & pickled jalapeño. This gets better and better. I ate all that food in a flash and it brought me back to my last trip to the original TA. My only complaint is the corn tortillas that the tacos were made of had some noticeable crunch which tells me it's a day old. But that can be remedied easily.

All in all, I say if you like the tacos before then come since they are done by the same folks. Same good and cheap tacos. The only thing missing is the imposing presence of Dan The Man (all 6'6\" and 200 lbs. of him).

I don't really know what exactly happened (personal or legal matter related to the original joint's closure) but I hope this NEW place survives. I also wish Dan (wherever you are) all the best.

Today's scene was like one in Despicable Me when Gru was gone and the minions took over the operation :)"}
{"text":"Use to love this place but my previous 3 or so visits have been disappointing, they've changed the menu and added a couple of new items which is fine by me, but during my last visit I ordered a asada pizza and when I got home there was a different type of meat on there. I called the establishment in which the cashier assured me it was in fact asada but you don't come to the same place for years and suddenly don't know how your order is suppose to taste. I tossed it in the trash along with the rest of my food because like I said this wasn't the first time my order had been messed up. 

It'll be a while before I head back over here"}
{"text":"Came from Northern California to see my new granddaughter and dad brought us here to have the best pastor taco I have ever had! Will definitely make this a must do when back in town! *****"}

The tacos and quesadillas were filled with well seasoned meat (pork, steak, beef, shrimp) and very fresh/tasty tortillas.  The employees are courteous and friendly and the prices are reasonable too! I definitely recommend if you want great Mexican food while in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have had in a long time.  I had the carne asada they were moist and flavorful. BF had the al pastor tacos he said they were the best tacos he had ever had. The meat was marinated and very juicy. The friends with us loved the rice and beans which I didn't have. They also said the horchata was the best the have had.  Very small quaint taco stand with good inexpensive food."}
{"text":"This place was so good I just had to bring my room mate to show her what really good Mexican tacos and Horchata tasted like.

This time around I got to try their Spicy Chicken Tamale and of course some tacos and a side of Horchata to accompany it. Also decided to dine in.

The Tamale was good, moist masa but not too thick or dry. The chicken actually had a bit of heat, but so flavorful. The tacos were amazing just how I remembered them.

Full 5 stars for the owner(?) who asked if I wrote the review that had a missing taco and said they would give me one on the house. Which I didn't feel was necessary, but was so nice. I ended up tipping them for it anyways.

The food here is amazing and miss my local eateries in San Jose, California so much because the flavor of the food is so similar. 

Great tacos, cheap prices and I give props to establishments who do take the time to read reviews here. 

Thank you Atoyac, I'll definitely be back for more Taco Tuesdays!

P.S. My room mate had never had Mexican food- besides Taco Bell and Chipotle (which you can hardly call Mexican/inspired) but she thoroughly enjoyed this new cuisine and left satisfied!"}
{"text":"Tortas to die for. Best tacos i have had and so cheap! Best hole in the wall. Really good aqua frescas."}
{"text":"Blink and you'll miss this spot, tucked next to a gas station just before the northeast corner of 19th Avenue and Glendale, which has become our go-to for good tacos in the Valley.  The exterior might look a bit intimidating, and the interior doesn't leave much to be said for atmosphere, but all you need are their extremely well-priced tacos to feel like this place could be your second home.  Carne asada is some of the best in the valley, fish tacos are phenomenal, and pastor and lengua were not disappointing.  The tortillas are the perfect weight and texture with just enough corn flavor.  We also tried the molote, a masa fritter with potato and chorizo, which was a crispy nugget of Mexican comfort food reminiscent of mashed potatoes if mashed potatoes got a stylish makeover that involved spice, black beans, and queso fresco wrapped in fried, corn-y goodness.  Service might be lacking, but for less than $15 to feed a hungry couple, you really can't complain."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to disagree with you all but I feel the \"new\" restaurant is better, more consistent, and friendlier since the changes. The churros are AMAZING!!! Fresh, soft, delicious! The serving sizes are certainly more consistent, previously I either got no meat, or way too much in my tacos. I pretty much always enjoyed my meal there but now I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"UM yeah... My friend at work kept talking about this place she called \"Scary Taco\" and she just raved about the fish tacos and pork burritos. Well, today we went and \"Scary Taco\" is actually called Tacos Atoyac, (or now this new name) and I see why she went on and on about it. The food is SO GOOD! The prices are SO CHEAP. The ambiance is SO AWESOME for a \"Scary Taco\" and I'm in love. I had the pork taco, shrimp taco and fish taco and they were amazing. They give you sides of grilled onions, a jalepeño and two kinds of salsas. You have to try this place. Don't be alarmed by the sketchy location or homely interior. You see all sorts of people coming in - blue collar, white collar, no collar. It's great. I'll be going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"The first place we checked out as soon as we arrived in Phoenix! We saw them featured on taco wars so we had to try their tacos. The fish taco was very disappointing (I had way better fish tacos elsewhere) but I enjoyed their beef tacos! It was as close to authentic street tacos in mexico as it could get. They also serve sautéed onions and hot pepper on the side which added more flavors to their tacos."}
{"text":"The menu is the same as Tacos Atoyac. There might be a few differences but my favorites are still available. I'm a fan of the carne asada tacos and possibly the best molote I've ever had. There is something off about the food now but I can't put my finger on it. Lower quality possibly? If you liked it before, you'll like it now though. Same flavors.

My review is for the service. Now that Dan is gone, no one greets you with a smile or friendly small talk. In fact, there's a language barrier. Not a big deal as long as my order is right and I know enough Spanish to get by but I miss getting acknowledged and thanked as I walk out the door. I'd say the customer service is down right bad now and I wouldn't doubt that the new (old?) owner doesn't really care. Bummer. 

Plus side, the a/c seems to work now!"}
{"text":"This place is really good I had there carne Asada tacos and the meat was perfect really full of flavor definitely coming back to this place they have this amazing green sauce they put on the side all together it's a really good"}
{"text":"I tried visiting the previous incarnation of Restaurants Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca (RAEO) on my last visit to AZ in the Spring of '14, but -to my disappointment- they had closed suddenly due to an apparent kerfuffle between the owners? But, like the venerable Phoenix rising from the ashes, RAEO was reborn to similar critical acclaims by the Yelp community. Being a bit of a Taco aficionado, I had to see what was doing and if all the hype was worthwhile. Here's the scoop:

Tacos:

Al Pastor- Probably the most uninspiring of the three meats I sampled; dry, bland and no sweetness that I usually associate from Al Pastor. 2* 

Tripas- Best of the bunch, as the Tripas were crunchy, tasty and not gamey at all. 4*

Carne Asada w/ Mole- Pretty surprised to see a Mole Taco on the menu, but -then again- they do have \"Oaxaca\" in their name. The Carne Asada had a nice beefy flavor, but was barely spiced up and the Mole was also just OK; it lacked the layers of flavor and complexity that a good Mole should have. 3* 

Churros- Very tasty Churros that were hot, fresh and they put some kind of glaze that really kicked them up to the next level. 4.25*

Horchata- Again their Oaxacan roots show through as their Horchata comes served up with Pecans and Cantaloupe to give it an almost dessert-like quality. That's not to mention that it might be the best Horchata I've ever had! Smooth, Cinnamony, creamy and the texture/flavor of the toppings really put this thing out of this world. 5*

Service & Ambiance- The lady taking our order at the front was nice enough, but seemed clueless about the menu and was constantly having to check with the back anytime we asked a question. Maybe she was new--who knows? I'm not from PHX, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out RAEO is in a bit of a Ghetto-fab neighborhood. All you have to do is look at their neighbors; Smoke shop? Check. Dollar Store? Check. Check Cashing? Check. Divey-looking bar? Check. It's confirmed. Ghe-to-the-tto... 2.5*

Value- Their prices are on the lower end for street tacos($1.25/ea), but they might be the smallest I've encountered. I know they're not supposed to be huge, but usually three will fill me up, and after eating three of theirs I was still hungry. Next time I'm getting five... 3*

This might be a situation where the hype surrounding RAEO might've gotten my expectations too high, because I was not impressed with the tacos and found them to only be mid-range. With that being said, I would still come back for the Tacos if only to get at some more of that white drank! Mild recommendation on the tacos, but highly recommended to get your sweet tooth fix. ¡¡¡Órale!!!"}
{"text":"Easily some of the best tacos in the phoenix area!

I've been here before they briefly closed, and since it opened up again and have noticed no change in quality. The Fish tacos are top-notch. There is a good amount of fish,  and a light batter - not too heavy, and never overcooked or tasting like oil, which I've experienced elsewhere.  The Carne Asada, Pollo, and Al Pastor are all great as well. I've tried the quesodilla with meat here as well, and its amazing! The horchata is pretty much the best I've had, and I always get horchata anywhere its available! 

Some tips - Say yes to the onions and peppers, say yes to the pecans and cantaloupe in the horchata, and make sure to drink the horchata from the top - not with a straw - to make sure you get some of this with the horchata. 

The exterior looks questionable, but don't let that turn you away, the meal more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I went back here not realizing I'd been here before... but I think it went by a different name? Tacos Atoyac? My review is somewhere on the old page. Well It wasn't until I was on 19th that I realized I was heading back to the same place. Since I was starving and its right around the corner from my dentists office, I decided to give the place a second try. Nope, same old problems. 

Got the:

*Carne asada tacos (1.50) - tiny portions, meat tastes funny to me like its been mixed in with other meats, which I suspect anyway since they probably use the same grill to cook everything. Still, I haven't had that issue at most Mexican restaurants I go to.  And the meat is also dry with some rubbery pieces. 

*Fish tacos (1.50)- tiny portion and the batter is just utterly bland. Rubios has better fish tacos. I don't care for the sauce they put on it either. 

*Spicy chicken tamale (2.25)- good portion size but comes with very little meat and kind of dry. 

*Horchata- its ok, almost has a milky, buttery taste to it. Not enough cinnamon IMO. 

I know 1.50 sounds cheap, but for the size and flavor, I don't think its worth it. Location is as hole in the wall as you can get in a very shady part of Phoenix. Even at 10am I still felt uncomfortable getting out of my car. And the construction around there is atrocious, although that is not their fault. They are building tracks for the lightrail to come through here. Service is friendly though. 

I really wanted to like this place but I don't think there will be a 3rd chance, especially with Taqueria Los Yaquis so close to here (too bad for weird hours though)."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places in the greater Phoenix area. The food is cheap but very good. The staff has always been friendly whenever I have visited and have never batted an eye whenever I have asked for more salsa (I always do). 

The spicy burro is very good and you can actually taste the flavor of the meat which was a nice surprise as it seems most places tend to hide low grade meat with overly flavored sauces. As mentioned in other posts, the tacos are small but that isnt such a bad thing. It gives you the chance to try a lot of different kinds. 

Even if you dont live in the area, this little place is worth the drive. The only issues are that its not very easy to find and parking can be in short supply if its busy."}
{"text":"When I heard that Tacos Atoyac had closed, I was super disappointed since I had only been once and because it was so good. So when I heard they had reopened, you can imagine my excitement! I went back a couple days ago and it is very much the same as it was before. I had 2 fish tacos and a molote (which I have never tried or heard of). The molote was SO good! it is fried masa with potato and a little bit of chorizo inside with black beans on top.... super tasty stuff. The fish tacos were good, but I feel like they weren't as good as when I had gone before. This could be a fluke, but the fish just wasn't as light and crispy as it had been. Regardless, it still tasted good and the fish still tasted fresh. I will be back! Hooray!"}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome. You can tell this restaurant is a labor of love. First off, you aren't going to find a fancy atmosphere here and honestly it's better that way, I wouldn't have it any other way. Secondly, the food is just insane, from the carne asada to the fish tacos to the lengua. It is all on point. All I need is a few tacos and a Jarritos and I am set! So glad to have a gem like this in Phoenix and it's worth a bit of a drive if you don't live super close. Honestly, I live for places like this. A++"}
{"text":"A divey little taco restaurant, in a not-so-great neighborhood... what could be better?

I love this taco place so much that every time I have a guest visiting me in Phoenix, this is one of the must-go stops. Their street tacos are true street tacos. Great price, great meat, great taste. 

My best advice - try one of every meat, you won't be disappointed! 
My personal favorite is el pastor and fish, but you have to find out for yourself because they are all so great. 

One tip - if you don't like onion, make sure to ask for no onion, as all of the tacos come with lots of onions."}
{"text":"Dan or no Dan this place is still amazing!! I actually found the service to be on point! They are actually giving more lemons with your meal than before (there's no one controlling the amount of lemons they give out anymore). Food is still awesome! Now they have churros. I actually wish they were open now because I'm jonesing for some lengua tacos uhmmm... Anyways make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time deciding what to get every single time we go! (Luckily everything is $1-$2 so getting five tacos is no big deal!) All of the tacos are generally on corn tortillas, dressed with fresh cilantro and onions. 

The fish tacos are my favorite, but the chicken, and al pastor are great too. They serve their tacos with a side of grilled onions, peppers, and fresh limes. 

The cashier/waitress is the same girl every single time and she is always super nice and helpful when you have questions."}
{"text":"You like fish tacos?  Go here.  That's all you need to know.  Sure, the building ain't pretty, and the surrounding area is sketchy and hard to get to because of light rail construction.

But eat some of the fish tacos (I recommend eating them there, takeout isn't as good) and you won't go anywhere else for a fish taco."}
{"text":"Have heard nothing but good stuff about this place so we decided to give it a try.  Really good carne asada at a great prucw of $1.50.  Refried beans were divine - smoky flavor you find much anymore.  The atmosphere is not the best; no cocktails.   However it is just around the corner, local and fresh."}
{"text":"Not so great.  The place is pretty, the server is very sweet (with limited English) and the margaritas were good.  But the food was bland.  Arepas were dry and nit as flavirful as we've enjoyed elsewhere.  Maybe our shared appetizer and two different entrées were a misorder or maybe it was a bad day?  At these prices, I exoect better tasting food."}
