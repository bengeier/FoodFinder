{"text":"For the price and the location (right next to bay station), the lunch options are pretty good. They have different daily specials depending on the day (I don't know if it is random or not). If you spend over $6, you get a free drink (water, tea, etc).  So if you want a free drink, don't get the daily special (because it doesn't come with a free drink).   I haven't tried their breakfast items so I don't know if they are any good."}
{"text":"Sooo good I love the everyday special its so chipper and they give you a lot I can't even finish it"}
{"text":"A coworker just discovered this cafe tucked away at the corner of Bay and Bloor and shared with me that their daily special of Japanese Curry Chicken with Rice was $4.99 + tax INCLUDING a bottle of water.   Excited about a new place to get lunch for a good price, I went over 10 minutes later to get the same thing.   Super excited for my curry, I paid with my credit card (bonus! No need to carry huge wallet in future) and left. Opened my bag - no water bottle and no curry!?!?  Thinking this was a mistake I walked back 2 city blocks (so at this point 8 city block round trip for a lunch...) to get the water bottle and curry on top of my chicken and rice... Only to find out they didn't have curry anymore!!!   How can you sell a Japanese Curry Chicken with Rice without Japanese Curry??? And why didn't they notify me that they ran out of curry and just give me chicken without a single word?? Plus I was off by 36 cents to get a water bottle... Yet my coworker got one without discrepancies?   I'm super disappointed.   I was even excited to grab breakfast there on the way to work after this lunch too... It's possible it's bad luck but enough to deter me from going back and spreading my experience with all my coworkers and friends who work in the area.  For those who are wondering, the chicken and plain rice itself was pretty decent though - but it kinda bland without the curry..."}
