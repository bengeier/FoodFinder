{"text":"Always well made but I am not a Chinese gourmet 
Best beef and broccoli around here and I love the general Tso 's chicken.  Friendly nice people 
Always ready in 20 minutes and prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Will do anything to make a quick buck and screw over someone. Over charged $10, but didn't notice till we got home, and didn't include the full order."}
{"text":"Well priced Always fast and good food. Never waiting longer than 15 mins.very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Their food is a tad pricey, but not when compared to other Japanese food. The General Tso's chicken is amazing and the won-ton soup (or however you spell is) is amazing too."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Fried Wontons. They are a good snack anytime. 

I eat a large Wonton soup at least twice a week. It is a good quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced and fast with orders. But the past two times I found something that resembled hair or something similar in my food. Haven't gone since..."}
{"text":"When I write my novel, it will likely be titled \"The Heartbreak of Chinese Food in Pittsburgh.\" It is a mystery to me that the Burgh gets so many kinds of food so right, and most of the Chinese food is just \"meh.\" But that's where we are.

We ordered sesame chicken and General Tso's chicken. My first clue that something was off? The only difference between the appearance of the two dishes was the sesame seeds. Would you be surprised to hear they tasted the same? Would you be surprised to hear they both tasted like sweet and sour chicken? I was.

On the way in, we asked a guy leaving with his takeout order what he liked. \"It's all good!\" he said with genuine enthusiasm - I believe that because I am a little worried that every dish is pretty much the same thing, so if you like one, you'll like them all. Meanwhile, I will keep looking for really good sesame chicken. Is that too much to ask?"}
