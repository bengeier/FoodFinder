{"text":"My partner insists this is some of the freshest sushi in Calgary, and since I also approve of their vegetarian fare, we've been eating here a fair amount in the last 6 months. Our patronage actually extends back several years, and I have never had a bad meal here, although a few times have been less than 5 star. Delivery through Skip the Dishes is also solid.   This is a more traditional style sushi restaurant than some in the city, but with a casual atmosphere, so it is good for large and mixed groups. I love the origami in the windows, as well as the small pieces around every set of chopsticks - very cute! A nice touch that makes them stand out a bit.   Decent sized menu with a good selection of spicy rolls, although they no longer have the vegetarian spicy roll I used to love. There are other good veggie options, though, such as the vegetable tempura roll (it's a bit unusual to see more than yam tempura in veggie rolls). The sashimi gets rave reviews from all of my dining companions. They also have a small selection of curries, noodles and other meals for non-sushi fans.   I would give them 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4 because my partner says the fish is just that good (I am sure he would say 5)."}
{"text":"The interior is simple and very dirty. The toilet was crazy dirty. The food wasn't that bad but it was just eatable (nothing more). The bill was 30% higher than at other my favourite sushi place. The conclusion for me is - stay away of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  They've got sumo wrestling on TV, and a little patio in the summer.  The takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls) are really good."}
{"text":"Rice texture could be better. But over all it's a great restaurant, love the ambience."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have found in Calgary. It's prepared consistently with a good range of sushi, sashimi and noodle dishes. My favourite piece by far is the tuna tataki sushi. I dream of the tuna tataki and the suggestion of it is enough to get me in my car. The spicy tuna and dynamite rolls are also excellent."}
{"text":"first, they've always got Sumo on which is fun.  Second, the sushi is consistently good, not the best in my opinion, but consistently good."}
{"text":"I have eaten all that Calgary has to offer in the way of Sushi and Kawa is consistently the best. Everything from the love boat to the tempura is fresh and delicious and they have loads of vegetarian options. Kawa is staffed by a small army of super-friendly ladies in bizzare uniforms who keep the warm sake coming. In the summer there is a small patio but in winter stay inside for the sumo matches on the big screen."}
{"text":"I' ve been going to Sushi Kawa as long as it's been open. It's not the most pleasing decor wise, but as far as the sushi goes you can't go wrong.  The rolls are good, as is the sushi itself. If I could say one thing about Kawa it is that the quality is consistent. And the service is consistent as well.  The only thing that bugged me a bit (I'm over it now) is a couple of years ago they made some of their rolls much bigger - as in more rice. We actually asked why and they said that they had gotten complaints that the rolls were too small so they changed them. I can only guess it was some people who had been at Tawa down the street (big awful rolls) and for some reason liked that. Who knows. But they (Kawa) have gone back to small rolls for most of their dishes again.  Consistent, clean, good service, nice people. Kawa isn't the best decorated as I noted, but for a local spot with consistent sushi, it does just fine."}
{"text":"When I want to infuse myself with a little bit of my time in Tokyo mixed with modern touches and tasty Japanese edibles, this is where I go. Reservations are a must if you're set on it -- it's often full, especially on weekend evenings. Some of the wait staff have been there for many years and they're adorable in their black and white slightly Lolita-ish getups, their greetings and goodbyes reminding me of Tokyo eateries. This restaurant is the best of urban-Japanese decor fusion with exposed brick and a modern feel mixed with traditional Japanese touches. It's not especially cozy due to the open layout but it's visually appealing and great with friends or a first date. You can even get your sumo love on with the bigscreen tv in the corner but I'm sure you'll be too busy devouring the plethora of what you order. The menu is absolutely amazing and best for first-time sushi tasters and the experienced alike -- it's full of photos and selections you can't find elsewhere in Calgary  (pictures are very common in Tokyo menus, aiding the international crowd). This is one of the few places that serves ume sushi (plum) and their spicy salmon sushi maki roll is to die for. The spicy teriyaki agedashi tofu is fabulous as is the beautiful dragon roll covered in avocado and filled with eel. Try some plum wine or liquer for something tangy on your palette! This place is awesome on summer evenings as the windows all open onto the wonderfully busy 4th Street. It will have you saying Itadakimasu (bon appetit)!"}
{"text":"Find the serving staff in cute little faux tuxedos and sumo wrestlers on the corner big screen. But the food is an even better find, delicious sushi and some of the best tempura that is offered in Calgary. Sushi Kawa is a convenient location for a night out or takeout. I really suggest the teriyaki tempura don; I get it almost every time plus a selection of rolls and other deliciousness. The only problem I have with Sushi Kawa can be said about almost any take out place and that is the excessive use of Styrofoam used in their packaging."}
{"text":"Great spot, good sushi and decent service. Could be better - not a big stand out place but not terrible."}
{"text":"the food is fresh which i enjoyed. the things i was disappointed with-- they charged for tea, they didnt have a lot of things on the sushi menu that i am used to like yamaimo, hirame or natto. when i asked for my sushi a specific way they wanted to charge me more. overall i think this place is decent but not up to par with japanese restaurants i have visited elsewhere. but since my sushi was fresh and it is in a good location i will probably return."}
{"text":"Went here for catch up lunch with a friend a few days ago. Food was mediocre, we shared an assorted sashimi, a bazooka roll, a spider roll and a melt crunch roll. First of all, presentation was nice especially on the sashimi, and the service was very good. However, I wasn't impressed with the sushi and rolls. Seemed to lacked flavour and fish/seafood didn't taste very fresh... a big no for me at a sushi restaurant. The melt crunch roll was my favourite out of what we got. This restaurant does have brown rice available which is good if you're being healthy and they also have a large selection of spicy rolls."}
{"text":"A place of comfort for me. I love the big pot of tea and the lunch bento box special! I  always feel welcome and at ease, it is a regular hang-out. I hope they stay the same. :-)."}
{"text":"Sushi Kawa is an alright place to eat japanese food. Being of Japanese heritage myself, I was happy to find a japanese restaurant tha was actually staffed with japanese people. No offense to others, but when I typically go to a japanese restaurant  I get served by a chinese person, a korean, or filipino. I want authentic flavors when I go out for japanese food. Also Sushi Kawa is one of the only restaurants in town that serves okonomiyaki. (japanese pizza). It is a dish that consists of flour, egg, cabbage, meat , etc then cooked on a grill then sprinkled with fish flakes and is eaten with Tonkatsu sauce and a japanese mayanaise.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeUHy0A1GF0 The one thing that turned me off about this restaurant, is that they aren't really friendly. It's not that they are rude, it just seems that they are indifferent. Which seems out of character for a japanese restaurant. They do not give you any extra tonkatsu sauce for your okonomiyaki, which costs $18.00 by the way. When I asked the waitress for more sauce, she said they would have to charge me extra for it. I was put off by this, that's like charging extra for ketchup for fries that you order at Earl`s. They should never charge EXTRA for sauce for a meal you are eating. That to me, is an insult. I may have to start eating at Hana Sushi down the street. It`s another Japanese run sushi bar the Fujimoto`s"}
{"text":"The ladies and I always go to Hana sushi for lunch, but this time it was suggested to try somewhere new!  I wasn't thrilled over this place. The service was super slow, the rolls were very heavy on the rice and just mediocre.  It defiantly was not a bad experience and the food was standard but I wouldn't come back, there is better out there."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place. I have been coming here for over 12 years and have seen the owners change. The apprentice that was following him for nearly 10 years took over and has made it even better. I love them!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner and it was an especially special evening. The staff went above and beyond to ensure service was prompt and informative. They even treated us to extra goodies that no one even ordered free of charge. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for quite awhile... the quality of the food have gone down quite a bit.... disappointed~~~"}
{"text":"I like it.   I visit often, cheap sushi, decent service, not the best sushi by any means but good enough, ideal location.   I'm not too hard to please when it comes to sushi.. probably because I don't get too crazy (usually spicy salmon rolls).. i love the typhoon roll.. though last time it wasn't up to par. O well, I'll go again.   I'm slightly let down by the lack of desserts tho! Not a big deal since the purple perk is near by."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Calgary. I first went there in 2001 and to this day it's still a fantastic place to have sushi. The waitresses are so friendly and quick and their uniforms are super cute! The prices are maybe a little higher than some sushi restaurants in Calgary but it's totally worth it, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good.  The service was friend ly and fast.  We went on a Friday which is usually best to go for sushi not near an ocean and the fish was very fresh.     Had some sashimi and rolls.  The sashimi was very good.  Also had an assorted sushi combo.   One thing to watch for is the sushi that is seared.  Be careful not to automatically order that on the sheet by accident.    My favourite was their negitoro roll. Also loved the Toro sushi.   Plum wine was nice.  My friend had not tried it yet and she liked it as an aperitif. I went with the large Asahi Beer. Very good!   The warm edamame beans were nice too.  You get some cold ones to start for free but we liked the warm ones.   My friend who goes here a lot says it's very consistent here."}
{"text":"The first experience I had with Sushi Kawa's was GREAT! The food is delicious and the plate presentation is immaculate. However the floor staff is what destroys the balance.  After a few visits I began to notice a switch in energy amongst the staff and towards it's customers. The core of the problem was intercommunication or lack of any...  I ordered 3 things off the menu during a dinner Last Summer and when they brought it to my table I noticed they served  the wrong Sushi Roll. I explained this to the waitress after she placed it on the table she smiled and said; \"Don't worry- you can have its complimentary- food go to waste if not eaten.\"   When people say complimentary the first thought that jumps into your mind is free, gift or no charge.   So after eating my meal and the waitress correcting my order with the right Sushi, I received my bill only to find an added charge of the WRONG Sushi! \"what, perhaps a mistake?!- what is going on?\"  When I pointed out the error they said I had to pay because I ate the food. SO BECAUSE YOU MESSED UP MY ORDER I HAVE TO PAY EXTRA?!?!   I was mad and red in the face arguing the matter with the manager who reacted with no empathy and seemed like a cheap, insincere man. I vowed never to return and buckled by paying the bill -NO TIP.  Somehow a while later I was dubbed into returning for a business lunch. The food was great, the waitress was no longer with Wa's and it seemed to go flawlessly  until my Boss ordered Vegetable Tempura and got Shrimp Tempura. I told him about the stick situation that put me in similar predicament proceeded with caution and laid down an iron fist.  Determined to NOT EAT the shrimp he returned the order back to the kitchen and waited an extra 20 minutes for the Veg Tempura. After lunch was completed our boss requested the check... only to find a charge for a shrimp Tempura NO ONE ordered. Again the same manager appeared from his coffin to suck more money out of us.... even though we did not eat the shrimp his theory was: \"the food was placed on your table and went to waste, who's going to pay for it?\" Definitely not the restaurant!   Payback is sweet- because their was 5 lawyers in our group the manager ended up breaking under pressure and taking the shrimp off the receipt and giving us 5% discount for a group and apology... it felt good to see the manager who I refer to as a Vampire (because he hides in the dark and never comes out unless summoned) Come to think of it their is no garlic on the menu - just saying!"}
{"text":"Yikes!   This review is long overdue. ;(    The boys and I were here on a very busy evening in May 2012 when there were about ten hungry customers lined up at the door.  The staff were extremely efficient and seated us after 10 minutes(impressive, considering the fact that we didn't make any reservations).        We took a little longer than expected to decide what to order(we found the menu too busy-looking and confusing), but here's what we had:  Apps:   Sake Braised Garlic Asari(clams):Yum!  Succulent clams with just the right amount of garlic.    Oyster Motoyaki:  a very fresh baked oyster with way too much mayo in it.   I used the rest of the (oyster flavored) mayo for my salad.          Mains:  Assorted Sashimi:  very fresh!  I even liked the hamachi, which I usually give to my hubby.  They give you generous mounds of wasabi and gari.  Sashimi and Tempura Dinner:  Miso soup, salad and ice cream was also included.   The tempura was excellent; we've been to other restaurants where the tempura was still swimming in grease when arrived on the table.  Teriyaki Beef Noodle:  my little guy is such a big fan of noodle soups--and hot(temperature-wise) soups, too!  Even after 12 minutes, his soup was still warm!   By the 15 minute mark, his bowl was empty...  Overall,  everything was very reasonably priced and we had a very pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at an affordable price.  Probably the best option on 4th street"}
{"text":"Being a big sushi fan, I decided to try this place instead of my usual sushi restaurants (sigh).   We went there on a Tuesday evening and there were only two other tables who were already dining. After looking at the menu, I realized this place is as expensive as fancy sushi restaurants !!!!!   It took them a good 15 minutes to notice us and take our order. We ordered an array of rolls, nigiri and appetizers in addition to sashimi. The miso soup arrived fast and it was tasty. However, that was the highlight of our dining experience !!!.  everything afterward went downward very fast. After waiting for 25 minutes we had to wave at the staff so somebody can finally notice us. then another 10 minutes, half of the order arrived, which made it very awkward for some of us that had nothing to eat !!!!!   Another 20 minutes to finally have the rest of the food !!!!! The rolls had too much rice and the fish was not the freshest. For 4$/piece of Toro, I was expecting at least super fresh fish which was totally not the case here. Also we spent at least 45 minutes waiting for our food, I cannot imagine what is this place going to be like on a busy night.   Right after the dinner, I was feeling funny and when I got back home I spent a lot of time in the washroom :( !!!!   Overall, highly not recommended, you can find much better restaurants in the neighborhood. The sushi quality is poor and the service is the worst you can imagine."}
{"text":"What to say .... Not my favourite....I will always be wary when I am the only table in a restaurant... I feel like a good restaurant should always have patrons.  All other restaurants on the block had people in them... This however was a ghost town. A ghost town of confusion. There was as posted before a language barrier with the servers. The menu was also slightly confusing and looked like it could use an update... The whole restaurant in fact. The sushi came out and I was not wowed by it.  It wasn't the best I've had it also wasn't the worst I've had.... But I won't be rushing back anytime soon"}
{"text":"While Sushi Kawa wasn't terrible, there was nothing memorable or essential about the experience.  Their gyoza didn't have that one golden crispy side, and was just an average dumpling!  The tuna sashimi was a generous chunk and quality was much better than the to.ro I also ordered, which was too thin and fibrous.   The deep fried spicy salmon roll was a little strange. There was too much rice to salmon and next to no mayo  or spiciness.  The salmon almost seemed to have come out of a can, which I know it didn't but it wasn't the texture you're expecting.  Dragon roll missed the mark too. Avocado wasn't ripe enough and the unagi was sparse and not nearly enough of the glaze I'm used to enjoying with it.  We ordered the special california roll as well as the calamari roll. The Special California roll was fine, lots of crab. The calamari roll's squid was overcooked so it was chewy.  The wasabi and ginger was very generous, and a good thing since you'll probably need it.  I did enjoy their rice, which was pleasantly sweet and held together well.  If you just need a sushi fix and you're in the area, all this was only $60, which isn't too bad, but there is better sushi out there!!"}
{"text":"Likes: -trendy location -attentive service -cheap as hell -mom & pop, independent business feel  Dislikes: - sushi was mediocre, sashimi slices were small - server had trouble answering questions due to lack of English - their menus are awfully ugly & confusing to the first-timers - only have one debit machine & had to wait a while to pay   I'd go back if I was invited since the sushi was alright and it's so cheap, but it's not a place I'd think of to go back to. I wouldn't choose this restaurant for sushi beginners. The language barrier and menu shenanigans would make for a really frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Coming from Vancouver I have to say that its very difficult to find decent sushi in this town. And by that I mean FRESH. I have visited a few places in search of Yam Rolls and any other veggie rolls - being vegan it's tough here as well.   What did I find? Decent yam tempura rolls. Good beer selection, great veggie options and the ability to modify mayo etc...  I've been a few times now ~ it's not my fave, but it's a safe bet for the area."}
{"text":"My partner and I ordered take-out from Just Eat. Free delivery over $15.  We ordered Typhoon roll, Dragon roll, Rainbow roll, and Miso soup. The Miso soup was $2.25 and it came in a little cup - not even fully filled - rip off for sure!  The Dragon roll was our favourite. The others - meh, nothing special,  had better sushi elsewhere. But considering that the rolls cost between $7-$13, and we had a coupon for additional 20% off on Just Eat, it was very affordable so we were okay with it. :) But we'll likely try sushi somewhere else or choose other options on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Update after a yearlong absence:  - Prices increased significantly; - Portions shrunk dramatically; - A couple of beloved menu positions are missing; - Service quality dropped down noticeably.  So, four star before, two stars now - that's three stars in total. Must be just about right.  Sorry, Sushi Kawa - you were our good memory about Calgary, we shouldn't have return and retry..."}
