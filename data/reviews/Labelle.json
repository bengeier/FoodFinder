{"text":"Known as one of the best places to get a poutine in the province, I have just discovered that they have a great variety of sandwiches as well. So far, I have tried their new philly cheese steak, that comes with a really tasty garlic mayo sauce on the side. Probably one of the best I have ever tasted! They also have a huge variety of wraps. The chicken club was a hit with me.   The girls that work behind the counter are very friendly, and I've noticed that they know a lot of customers by name - a good thing."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine! We came here two years ago while staying at a cabin and made a special trip to Lachute on our way back from Saint Hippolyte to taste it again. So good! Squeaky curd as it should be and tasty gravy. A little on the messy side since it's served in a styrofoam container loaded to overflowing in a paper bag.  Try the Guedille hot dog too. No wiener, but a mix of onion, mushroom, and cheese.  Staff are friendly and helpful."}

{"text":"Grâce à la suggestion d'un ami, j'ai découvert la \" patate \" Labelle lors d'un séjour dans un chalet tout près de Lachute. Nous avons fait un petit détour pour goûter à la fameuse guédille, spécialité de l'endroit. J'ai été agréablement surprise!  En entrant, nous remarquons que le restaurant est plein à craquer et que tout le monde semble être familier avec la place. Les filles qui s'occupent des commandes sont hyper gentilles et souriantes, même à l'heure du \" rush \". Notre commande en main, nous prenons place à une table à l'intérieur puisqu'il pleut. Autrement, nous aurions profité de la jolie terrasse arrière.  À l'attaque! La poutine est carrément délicieuse. Les frites sont parfaites, il n'y a pas trop de sauce, mais PLEIN de fromage, miam! Pour ce qui est de la guédille, c'était ma toute première expérience et c'en a été toute une! Oignons et champignons sautés, bacon, fromage, chou, mayonnaise et piments forts, le tout dans un pain hot-dog garni de graines de sésame, quel délice! Bon ok, pas très bon pour ceux et celles qui surveillent leur ligne, mais il faut bien se gâter en vacances! Je comprends maintenant pourquoi chaque client commandait le #7 - Combo poutine et guédille (9,95 $ si ma mémoire est bonne). Si vous êtes plus du type classique, optez pour un hot-dog ou un burger, également très bons à ce qu'on m'a dit. Le restaurant Labelle offre aussi une variété de sandwichs et d'autres plats.  J'ai déjà hâte de retourner au chalet pour faire un petit détour par la patate Labelle! En plus, elle est ouverte 24 h sur 24!"}
{"text":"Most people come for the advertised tasty artery clogging food: The best all-dressed hot dogs in Quebec, amazing fries and poutine. They put a pickle slice in your dogs instead of relish.  Then most people return for their healthy foods: Cajun wraps are amazing!  The staff is quick and they have outdoor seating for the summer."}
{"text":"Came in for a burger and poutine. Traditional place that offers an expanded menu. Sadly they don't have a printed copy so you're stuck twisting and turning trying to read from chalkboards on 3 different walls hoping people aren't waiting to order as they would block the view. The food itself was good, but the communication needed work.   I asked for my burger to be all dressed and noticed that they were putting mayonnaise and asked them to skip that topping. They repeated that I wanted all dressed, and I said yes, but no mayo. I presumed I wouldn't have to mention that the first round because I have never seen a \"Friterie\" put mayo in the \"all dressed\" category. \"all dressed\" at a friterie usually means certain ingredients, not some of absolutely everything.   As I myself had said all dressed I didn't mind that a topping I wasn't fond of would be on my burger, however my problem became that they kept pushing to remake the burger (meanwhile we're starving and waiting to eat), I kept asking them NOT to remake the burger, just to finish the toppings and give it to me, and it nearly became an argument for them to make me wait to remake the burger all because of a little mayo. I told them over 3 times NOT to remake the burger and to just give it to me. It became such a hassle that I actually lost my appetite and sat there not eating while my friend finished their meal. The staff member came up after to emphasize that their boss pushes the \"customer is always right\" and should always leave 100% satisfied, which is great, but if I am repeating myself and at the point of arguing just to get handed my food then you're not listening to what the customer wants. Left with a box of food that ended up being thrown out, I would have eaten it if they had just handed it to me with fu***** mayo in it, but why put me through so much of a hassle over a topping I wasn't mad about?"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a little road trip for late lunch. We had the famous overflowing poutine in a bowl, in a bag. It was pretty awesome. The squeaky, mouthwatering cheese curds just kept coming. I find that a lot of the time, the cheese will only be sprinkled on top so once you've eaten those up, that's it. Not this time! She actually made it in layers. Like several of them. This is what all poutines should be like. The two ladies behind the counter were sharp and very quick, serving a dozen customers in no time. A great little casse-croûte in Lachute."}
