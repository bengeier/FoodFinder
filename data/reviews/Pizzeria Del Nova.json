{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight and it was not good. Pizza was so greasy it was soggy and overloaded with cheese. Dessert was stale. Tasted like week old grocery store cake."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I were famished and we're looking for a kid friendly place to eat. We came across this pizzeria and we're pleasantly surprised when the waiter came out to help us with the stroller. The service was thoughtful and attentive - though they didn't have any crayons or colouring sheets, the waiter still gave my toddler a piece of paper and his highlighter to keep her happy while our food came in. 

Overall, it was a bit pricy. But given the thoughful service and the delicious pizzas, it was worth it. We have since made it our go-to neighbourhood pizzeria."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant at around 7:50pm and sat at the tables outside. I went in immediately to inform them that we were sitting out front. At 8:20pm, a gentleman came out and asked to take our order, when we informed him that the table was dirty and littered with the used plates and glasses of the previous customers. He then cleared the table of the dirty plates and glasses, wiped down the table and took our order of two 14\" pizzas. We also asked him for glasses of water and a corkscrew and ice bucket since we had brought our own wine. Another 15 minutes pass with no water, no ice bucket and no corkscrew. I go back inside to ask for a corkscrew and am told that it's coming. Another 15 minutes later and the waiter comes with the wine glasses, but nothing else. He disappears for a moment and comes back to hand me a corkscrew for me to open the bottle myself. After another 5 minutes he comes back with the water and the ice bucket. It is now close to 9:00pm, we have been sitting for more than an hour and have just received our first glass of water. Every time the waiter comes, we are assured that the order will be arriving in only a few moments. Another 30 minutes pass and the waiter comes out with some bits of bread on a small plate, again assuring us that the food is coming. Another 15 minutes and we are done. We go into the restaurant, explain that we have been waiting for 2 hours with no food and instead of an apology, we are told that the pizzas are not yet even in the oven. We just walked off, bought frozen pizzas at the grocery store and ate them at home.

One of the worst restaurant experiences in 30+ years of Montreal dining.

While the waiter was apologetic every single time he came to our table, the level of service was poor and the manager didn't offer us an apology when we explained the situation.

My recommendation is to avoid this establishment."}
{"text":"The pizza was bombbbb and the chef and waitress were very welcoming. It had a cozy atmosphere and its affordable for college students who are just trying to grab something to eat in Westmount."}
{"text":"DELICIOUSSSS FOOD!!! Really very good and much-needed in this area. Pasta and pizza are perfect, big portions, great quality, seriously one of the best pasta I've had in a long time in Montreal. 

Everyone should try it. Going back to eat now bye."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and I am Currently going on 2 hours waiting for my food.... not impressed, no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Really good gluten free pizza, the crust is quite nice.  The owner is also very friendly and hospitable. Free WiFi is a plus too. Would definitely go back if in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a brand-new pizzeria on Sherbrooke street in Westmount village.  Since it just opened up, I think it's important to temper expectations as most places need time to iron out the kinks. Hence my 3 star will probably increase next time...
We ate outside on the terrace and had very friendly and attentive service from our waitress.  I ordered the pizza special (12 inch pizza of choice, salad del nova and a drink) which was 20$ and my wife ordered a chef salad ($14).  The American pizza was very good and we would both eat it again. Turns out both of our salads (see my pictures) were the same - mixed greens. As mixed green salads go, it was ok - but when you consider it was 14$ that's excessive for what you get. 
We didn't eat dessert and so I can't comment on that. 
They do deliver and our waitress indicated that delivery prices were cheaper than eating in."}
{"text":"This place is a good Italian comfort food take-out option in the Westmount area. I tried it about 4 months ago. We tried the duo pasta-pizza for $16 each. Really decent size of food - 1 full small pizza + that rose sauce is to die for! The pizzas are also good but they just needed some more broiling on top. Since then though, I think they put their prices up so not sure it would still be worth that price..."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out as it was new in my neighbourhood and I love pizza. They had a 20$ special which included a salad, a pizza (any kind), and a drink. So my cousin got the special and I just got a pizza. I ordered a plain mushroom pizza and when the waitress brought them out, I had gotten the wrong one. The one I got was with lobster and shrimp and so I told her it was the wrong pizza so she brought it back in and 2 minutes later she comes out with the \"right\" pizza but there was still shrimp and lobster on it. So all they did was they tried covering up the same pizza with mushrooms so I told her I didn't like shrimp and she apologized and said she'd give me a discount. She then offered my cousin another free refill, which was nice of her. Anyways when it came to the bills, she gave my cousin and I one bill which only included my cousins order. So she gave me my pizza for free.

*as for the pizza, it isn't worth 16$-20$. I don't mind paying that price for pizza but this REALLY isn't worth it. If I wanted a plain \"thick crust* pizza id get it else where for way cheaper*"}
{"text":"Yes, there could be a little wait but the food is vey good, made from scratch and hence the wait 
Pizza dough is the best I've had in years 
Place is clean, owner is friendly 
Really good place for lunch"}
{"text":"Owner was incredibly friendly, and pizza was cooked right infront of us. Everything clearly home made and delicious.

Saw some reviews of bad service, I'm pretty sure it's just because they were new to the business, but have figured everything out since then.

The experience felt very Italian with the owner coming by and engaging in conversation with us. Very nice experience."}
