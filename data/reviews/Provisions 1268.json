{"text":"Food was good but I guess I had too high expectations due to all the 5 stars reviews. Probably because the menu is constantly changing, it really depends whether you are lucky or not to go on a day with a good menu. The day I went, I found the dishes good, but nothing WOW. The portions are very small, I was feeling just alright after 8 courses, but my husband was still hungry after. Service was very good though. Will I go back? Probably not in the short term since Montreal has so many other good restaurants to try."}
{"text":"The food was great. Everything was prepared extremely well, the attention to detail was unique. However, for 150$ for two just for the food just didn't seem appropriate. We received  3 dishes to share to start, all delicious but very small. One had been an asparagus dish split between 2 people it gave us 2 pieces of asparagus each. The other dishes were equally small. We then received each a pasta dish, again so delicious but it had 4 pieces of pasta and two cubes of lobster with a little truffle shaving. Then we had a fish dish to share, again half of an appetizer and to finish the savory part we each received another dish with a small amount of protein and a few veg. Again it was all fantastic but the size didnt seem to fit the price. We received one small dessert to share to finish our meal and it was great. It came down to a 7 course meal that cost $150 for one person that was just split between 2."}
{"text":"Unbelievable dinner last night at Provisions. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared and curated. For anyone who loves food,  all food,  this place is a must.   Wine menu is awesome as well. We had a funky pinot noir from France which was unique and out of the ordinary. Perfect for us!  All in all a wonderful experience. Will recommend to anyone I know visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is seriously incredible.  Easily one of the better meals my wife and I have had.  Keep in mind that I say this not only as a snooty New Yorker, but also as a foodie that has been to some of the best restaurants in the world.  With that said, I typically do not like the 15-20 course tasting options so prevalent at higher end places (eg EMP).  After like the 7th or 8th tasting I get bored and restless.  I much prefer shorter tasting menus and this place fits the bill.  The tasting menu consists of two appetizers, two main dishes, and a dessert.  Every day the menu changes depending on what fresh ingredients they have.  Everything that we had was incredible, very fresh and very well prepared.  Everything tasted delicious as well.  I would go through everything we ate in detail but since the menu changes it doesn't matter.  Trust these guys though they know what they are doing.  We sat at the cooking station, which was fantastic as you got to watch them prepare all the food.  Service was warm and welcoming, we were very well attended to the whole time we were there, but at the same time they were not overbearing.  Finally, this place is an incredible value.  60 canadian dollars per person, or about 45 american dollars. In New York this would have been 100-150 american dollars PER PERSON.  No joke, the quality of the food is that high.  This place is so amazing that we already have plans to come back, and we don't even live in Montreal! It's that good."}
{"text":"This is a small, comfortable restaurant where you can have a very tasty two-person meal.   The staff are very attentive and chill. The ambiance is not upscale. The game was playing and there was a batman poster in the room.   Basically this is way expensive and the food is buttery and good. Haven't considered going back or recommended it to anyone  The room is arranged 100% for 2-person tables. Long bar, a few 2person tables, perhaps one 4 top in the front.  Plates are very small and made for 2  You are 'left wanting more' which is titilating but sometimes almost weird, Since dishes are made to share they are plated for one, and you have to do careful dissection to ensure more than like 4 bites per person!"}
{"text":"\"Petit\" restaurant par la taille (une vingtaine de couverts) mais \"grand\" par son inventivité, la saveur de ses plats et son accueil. Chaque service est une découverte. Bravo."}
{"text":"My partner and I came to Montreal for a 4 day weekend. We both had not visited this beautiful Canadian city since the 80's. On Saturday September 18th we walked all over Montreal. In the early evening we started to look for a restaurant for dinner. I found a blog that listed the \"10 Best Restaurants\" in the Outremont section of Montreal.  We read the reviews and headed to Van Horne street. We could not get into our first choice as we did not have reservations. We continued to walk and found a few restaurants but their menus did not intrigue us. Then we arrived in front of Provisions 1268 and in the window was a sign that said that they do not have a menu. Intrigued we walked in. At the time they were half full. The hostess greeted us and showed us a list of ingredients on a chalkboard. She explained that these were the ingredients that the chef would be using for the evening but she would not tell us what he was making. She did inform us that if we did not like a particular ingredient the chef would not use it in what he would prepare. She then informed us that they were fully booked for the evening but they had a bar in the kitchen and we could eat there. At first I wasn't so sure so we followed her and saw that, yes we would be right in the kitchen, but it was still open to the entire restaurant. We decided to stay and I am so glad we did. To say this was one of the best dining experiences we ever had is an understatement. Akim and his staff served up at least 10 plates of gastronomical excellence. From streak tartare to the hazelnut ice cream with strawberries and creme friache our taste did the happy dance. WOW! the flavors on all the plates served were amazing. You could taste each fresh ingredient and each did not overwhelm the others. I felt as if I was on the set of a cooking show on the Food Network. I know that Montreal is a real foodie town and has many amazing restaurants but if you are a native or visiting you must make your way to Provisons 1268. You will not be disappointed. Tell them Louie & Stew from New Jersey sent you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here.  It was beyond words. The staff, the cocktails, the music was perfect. The food. Masterpiece. Probably the best restaurant in Canada."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp to specifically rate this delightful find. One of the most delicious meals of my life. For anyone local or traveling to Montreal with a passion for true farm to table dining and an excitement for unexpected and unforgettable flavors, Provisions cannot be missed."}
{"text":"I can give a million star to this restaurant ,  It's just beyond AMAZING the food, the service, the atmosphere .It's a very small restaurant but you can feel how it cozy and comfortable  Paul is  very knowledgeable  when it comes to wine , he made our experience even more special .  we had 7 courses and every course is better than the one before ending up with the best deserts I've ever had in my life , the pastry chef is a real genius . I will recommend this place to all the ppl I know ,and definitely I'm going back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Everything we ate was fresh, beautiful and delicious. Easily one of the best meals I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I came here with 3 of my friends for dinner on a Wednesday night for the tasting menu. There are two options: $65 for 5 course or $75 for 7 course. Since we were all visiting Montreal for our first time and were on vacation we went with the $75.  We were all extremely satisfied with the service, food, ambience, and everything that the restaurant offered. First, we were sat right in front of the chef. So we were able to have a conversation with him and see what he was doing. The foods were all amazing! Honestly this was the best meal from our Montreal trip (all 4 of us agreed).   The owner and the chefs are very friendly. The owner kept coming around to have some talks. At the end, we were asking them for some restaurant/bakery recommendations and they suggested couple to us.   Overall this place exceeded our expectations (and we came with a highhhh expectation already)"}
{"text":"Great date night dinner experience. It was our first time here and my husband & I ordered the 7 servings set menu and we were both blown away. Every dish was fresh, interesting, complex and delicious. The first dish (leeks w cheese melted over) was amazing. I also loved the pork ravioli with carrots mushrooms and cheese. Amazing. The desserts were also very unique. The first was a beet sauce with red corn ice cream. It was ok, but for me beets +  weren't the best fit.  However dessert #2 made up for it: pana cotta w sesame seed ice cream. Amazing. Overall we had a great time here and enjoyed our meal immensely! Can't wait to return soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Montreal and several of my restaurant industry friends highly recommended Provisions.  From first contact at reservations until the final course, it was an outstanding experience.  The food is locally sourced, of the highest quality, and perfectly presented.  Flavors accented the best in each ingredient and were well balanced.  The staff is very knowledgable, and they have put together a very impressive wine list which pairs well with the cuisine.  I could go on about the menu, but it changes on a daily basis.  Pro Tip:  Get the full tasting menu.  After the second course, you'll be served a warm, Parker House type roll, baked in house, and topped with creamy butter and chive.  You'll be tempted to devour it at once, but save some to sop up the gorgeous sauces that accompany the pasta and meat courses.  You can feel the passion from everyone on the staff.  This is a culinary gem, and worthy of its reputation.  Provisions is a very small, intimate space, and reservations are almost a must.  Sit at the Chef's counter to watch the magic happen in the kitchen.  Voila!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner here! Such a wonderful staff, space, food and drink experience! No menu but they will ask about allergies or sensitivities in advance and were happy to do no meat for me and meat for my husband. I think there were 5 courses, some to share and some individual. Used the DINR app to find a reservation. We will come back for sure, as often as possible."}
{"text":"Very happy with this choice!  Chef Pablo was a gracious, friendly host and we thoroughly enjoyed all the five courses (plus \"surprises\")!  The menu changes nightly based on what's available!  We also chose the wine pairing (which isn't listed but available)!  Creative combinations and very enjoyable.  Make the trip, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved this market fresh dining experience. An intimate 25 seat bistro in Outremont where a small dedicated team cooks you a multi-course meal from the ingredients listed on a mini blackboard on the wall. Changes weekly, or even daily.  You can envision the staff walking through Jean Talon market every few days to get inspired and stock up on fresh goods. Each dish was an event. We knew that we were in for a treat when we tasted the freshly cooked brioche rolls at the start of the meal. We pretty much devoured every course. They looked great and tasted even better. For a few dishes we were in a state of gastronomic bliss, truly Bill Murray clones from \"What about Bob?\". I don't want to deconstruct and describe every course - just go and experience the spontaneous and creative cooking for yourself!   Bonus points for the futuristic toilet, cool staff, after dinner whiskey and nostalgic tunes soundtracking the moment.   Extra kudos to my dining partner for taking me to such a wonderful spot; my kind of place."}
{"text":"Super bonne bouffe avec des aliments frais du marché, service ultra sympa et attentif, ambiance cool. Petit alors réservez! 60$ par personne et ça le vaut. Paiement cartes de crédit et interac. Allez-y!"}
{"text":"The second stop on our annual Montreal food tour, Provisions produced mixed results. While there is clear talent here, the daily menu change might be too ambitious. Well cooked and incredibly fresh dishes often needed more thought and editing in order to become complete. I'm also glad we didn't pay for the complimentary biscuits, as they were cold in the center and - I'm sorry to say - reminded me of canned pilsbury biscuits.  Our cocktails had only a trace of liquor and also needed some fine tuning, and the house beer tasted like Budweiser, however another local beer suggested was excellent. And while the atmosphere was nice, some more attention to the music would be welcome - there's only so much Michael Jackson I can stand while eating.  On a more positive note, the staff was knowledgeable, friendly, professional and - as I said - clearly with talent. Additionally, the dessert was excellent, and I'm saying this as someone who normally doesn't like dessert and wishes it was not on a tasting menu in place of a good cheese course.  Simply changing to a menu that changes weekly or monthly rather than daily might be enough to fix these issues and allow Provisions to compete with other gourmet restaurants in the food Mecca that Montreal has become. I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Provisions 1268 is a true Montreal culinary experience bringing local produce and fresh Quebec ingredients to a whole new level.  Chef Pablo personally served my fiancé and I at the chef's table and it was an unforgettable experience.    The Prefix menu included six courses; the first course was a fresh ricotta mushroom infused cheese vegetable with local asparagus; the second course included a lobster dish served with shaved celery, compressed cucumber & mango, cilantro and a grapefruit puree; Third course included a fresh cavatelli pasta with asparagus in a white toasted parmesan sauce; The fourth course included a seared albacore tuna with foie gras: The fifth dish was a veal belly with sweetbreads in a maple glaze sauce; and finally the sixth course for dessert included a brown butter ice cream with strawberry jam and a house strawberry shortcake.  Service was A+ and extremely attentive. Overall Provisions 1268 is a must visit for anyone who loves good food. This place is going places. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This morning I made a reservation for two people through the DINR app. It was for 6:00 pm which is a bit early for dinner but my partner and I still managed to make it (albeit 30 minutes late). I called around 3:30 pm to let them know that we are pescatarians (since they do not have halal or kosher). This place does not have a menu, they have a $65 - 5 course meal, and a $75- 7 course meal. So if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, you should tell them in advance so they can plan accordingly.  When we walked in, we were surprised at how small and empty the restaurant was. It has only one long table at the front that seats no more than 6 people and two bar height tables for two. The rest of the seats are at the bar. When we arrived, we were greeted by no less than 2 people and seated immediately by the kitchen. I'm really glad we sat there because it was almost as if we had a private Netflix show, like Chef's table, with a view of all the meals that were being prepared.  We decided to take the $65 meal since the 7 course comes with an additional appetizer and dessert. They start you off with two tinyyyy pieces of bread. They are soaked in olive oil and topped with scallions. Petite but delicious.  Next we had the first course- which was salmon from Maryland, with some cucumber, and avocado sauce. It was probably the plainest of all the courses but very light and not fishy at all, I would describe it as refreshing.  The second course was a beet salad, it had a white beet sauce splattered onto a plate with red and yellow beets scattered throughout. It also had pickled onions, grapefruit and my favorite part- toasted almonds. This dish was delicious and fresh and composed in a breath-taking manner. It was dramatic and subtle in flavor at the same time.  The third course was the first warm meal, a few really fresh shrimps and some roasted red peppers with a delicious cream sauce. It was less memorable than the beet salad but also so perfectly balanced in terms of salty/sweet/fresh/savory.  The fourth course was an incredible sous vide cod with a delicate sear. It was served with a leak, lentils and a delicious green sauce. This was my favorite course of the evening and I believe we were the only guests served it (the other guests had some sort of ravioli).  The final course was a delicious chocolate/ banana/ hazelnut dessert. Torn hazelnut cake, sprinkles of hazelnut and chocolate crumble, caramelized bananas, chocolate hazelnut ice cream.  All of the food was absolutely delicious, although it is very small. You shouldn't expect to feel completely full but you will feel satisfied. Also the service is incredible here- our water glasses were never more than half way full and we were constantly checked on. Our server would explain each course and every ingredient, including where the ingredients are sourced from. The room was a bit chilly the entire evening and the bathroom is tiny (but with an awesome Japanese style bidet toilet). However for a $150 price tag (after tax, before tip) I feel like I had an amazing time and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a real food experience instead of simply an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Plats excellents, service et ambiance parfaite, carte des vins superbes... mais le confort est laissé de côté avec des bar stool insuportable et les portions de la formule dégustation imposée laisse sur la faim.   Mais tout était délicieux,  ce qui me laisse vraiment déchirée."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great service. Three of us were seated at the bar in the kitchen. We watched the chefs prepare & cook our dinner. Each of us elected to have the 7 course dinner option. Food was prepared with passion and expertise."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here on Saturday night. Everything was great from start to finish. We chose the 7 course option as recommended by our server as this was our first time at Provisions. Each course was beautifully presented and equally delicious. Our favorites were the crab toast, skate and rutabaga and the pistachio cream dessert. Service was excellent and we left full and happy. Definitely got our moneys worth and will pass along the recommendation to anyone visiting MTL!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Do you really need to know more?  I read the info about how they change their menu weekly based on what they see in the market. And I quickly made a reservation for one of my first nights in town. $60 for a five course menu of this quality and creativity is a steal. P  Very small and a fun vibe, so be sure to set up a spot before hand. Most of the seats are at a bar, which can be fun for couples but needs to be strategic for 3-6 size groups.  But if you go with a foodie DC I would suggest sitting near the far end of the bar so you can watch all the great things being Created.  We were mesmerized at times watching the staff prepare the tasty treats.   Since the menu always changes I won't spend time telling you about dishes. All I want to say is the flavors were \"clean\" and vibrant. Each dish worked with great ingredients that were amazing by themselves and were well balanced so the sum was greater than the whole.    I already want to go back! Staff was fun, interesting, and all the while professional.  Everyone helps out at provisions and it very much makes it a great experience."}
{"text":"Quand vous entrez chez Provisions 1268, vous jetez un coup d'il à l'ardoise qui liste les ingrédients du jour. Si vous avez une allergie, vous le signalez, puis ensuite vous attendez qu'on vous serve 5 plats surprise, dans une ambiance décontractée, probablement au bar (il n'y a que 2 ou 3 tables). Vous suivez ce qui se passe juste à cote en cuisine et la bouffe est excellente! Le seul bémol que je vois est le confort: les 5 plats sont à partager, alors vous passerez probablement votre repas un peu tordu pour piquer dans l'assiette centrale. Mais il en faudrait beaucoup plus pour me couper l'envie d'y retourner! Je ne vais pas vous gâcher la surprise en vous dévoilant tous les plats mais je ne peux pas vous empêcher d'en détailler un. Alors si vous aimez les surprises, prenez votre téléphone et réservez vite, tout est délicieux. Si vous y allez bientôt, demandez à goûter les orecchiette faites maison, servies avec des pleurotes érigés, du bacon d'agneau maison et une purée d'aubergine... Les 5 services vous coûteront $60 et vous vous serez régalés!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Had the 7 course tasting and every one was a keeper. Clearly the team takes a lot of pride on what they serve.  Small space but wonderful meal if you enjoy food."}
{"text":"My husband and I attended last night and I cannot begin to say how much I loved the food. This restaurant was one of my must do things for my Montreal vacation and I'm so glad we went. I loved being able to walk in and not stress about what to order and just be surprised with amazing and fresh food. My absolute favorite dish of the night was one of the appetizers that was a seafood ragu. My only critique is that the portions are a bit small and the staff seemed rushed. However, I would still highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"A real treat. Not cheap but a rare 7 course delight. Every plate was delicious. The service was friendly. The drinks were tasty. For a special treat you can't do better. Go. Enjoy. Spend some money, leave satisfied with no regrets."}
{"text":"Having the 7 service tasting menu. It's so tasteful I have to write the review like now!!!! Even the bread as entrée was delicious. The place looks like a bistro bar with limited seating (30?) where you wouldn't expect to have Michelin quality food. Portions are small but so damn tasteful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"honestly the best meal of my life. we made last minute reservations and they were so welcoming, kind, and efficient. INCREDIBLE service and food -- we felt so perfectly cared for. we loved not having to choose the menu, and they even chose wine for us (which was PERFECT!). we will come back every time we go to Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, warm atmosphere, even the music is good. My friend and I had a seven course tasting menu (I am kosher, she is not, was not a problem) - the chef's creativity is endless (the other diners had something different yet). We asked them to pick the wines to go with the seven courses - the result was very far from cheap (about $300 for the two of us), but worth it (and I don't say that lightly)."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this local butcher shop/lunch spot this afternoon. There menu is pretty straight forward, sandwiches like brisket, cubano and classic burger are a few of there lunch items. I heard great things about the brisket but I opted to trying the cubano, classic Cuban sandwich with pork, ham, Swiss, pickles, mustard and a lovely purple cabbage to balance that savoured salty treat.   The sandwich was delicious, they get there brewed fresh for a local spot nearby, the pickles add a vinegary bite the sandwich needs, and the pork is succulent woh the right amount of fat! I'm glad I took the time to pop in for a quick bite, I'm definitely going to come here and try a few things on there menu, and tbh there selections of meat look also extremely tantalizing. Definitely worth a try if your in the outremount area!"}
{"text":"It's been over a year that i have been here but the sour note it left me with is still lingering. I brought my husband there for his birthday after reading all the great reviews.we were seated at the bar and were introduced to our waitress of the night.thats when everything went downhill.the waitress was tina an,the front of house/co-owner.having dined at high end and casual restaurants in montreal over the years i have never witnessed such a pretentious service.it began with snickering while correcting my wine choice pronunciation.she then presented the menu and said we needed to choose from the ingredient list on the blackboard hung on the wall.we told her we were unable to read clearly from our seats and asked if she could go over the list with us.she bluntly refused and told us to walk over to the board and read it ourselves.we should've left right there but we decided to go ahead and order the 75$ 7 course tasting menu with chef's choice of ingredients and hope that the food would make up for the bad start.when making the reservations i had specified for 1 meat-free option (with seafood ok).our unfriendly waitress said it would not be a problem.We were served similar plates,my husband would be served a meat protein with a side of vegetables and my plate would have only the side of vegetables.After receiving 4 plates like this i inquired with the waitress of this issue and instead of addressing our concerns she sent over the busboy who then had the chef make the changes.the waitress never once made a wine pairing suggestion,described our plates,asked us if we enjoyed the food or even made eye contact.she continued to ignore us and payed special attention to other customers instead.she made us feel like we were a nuisance to her and not worth her time.we even wondered if it was because we were asian (like her) and she favored caucasian customers instead.at the end of the night the sweet busboy asked us if we enjoyed our experience,we mentionner sadly if it wasn't for the bad service from our waitress it would have been a good night.he then sent over chef pablo who was apologetic and served us complimentary shots.if only it wasn't too late.300$ bill for a pretentious and horrible service.so please if you decide to go to provisions,ask not to be served by tina an or she may ruin your night."}
{"text":"This is hands down, THE best meal that I've had in 2016 so far. I called ahead and snagged 2 seats at the bar for the 60$ 5 course menu. They called to verify any allergies and to make sure about any other dietary restrictions that we may have.  The menu here is constantly changing as it's based on what they find at the market that looks awesome. My dinner mate had some beef that made her tear up, it was THAT delicious and I had the yummiest fish with just the perfect amount of sauce, they truly nailed it. The vegetables were all done perfectly and we could see 90% of the prep done right in front of us which is always fun.  The wine list is large, but solid and they have quite a few by the glass. Definitely sit at the bar so that you can watch the action and meet cool new people. There aren't many tables as the place is tiny (it's the old Van Horne), so if you aren't a bar person, be sure to make your reservation WELL ahead of time if you really want a table. They've also got a hella fancy Japanese toilet, so don't wait until you're on the brink of being unable to wait, because people seem to take their time in there playing with all of the settings (12 minutes, lady...seriously.)  I felt like that lady in the IKEA commercial that is speed walking out of the store yelling \"Start the car!! START THE CAR!!\" because for 60$ for that incredible meal, I feel like it was a serious bargain.  The time that the staff spends to explain each dish and ingredient to you was a highlight and the presentation knocked it out of the park. Is your date a food snob? Bring them here. If not, invite me and I'll join you :)"}
{"text":"At first, I wasn't sure if it'll be enough food to fill my big appetite (even though it's a 5 services) since the plates are shared. Turns out it was more than enough. Each dish was flavourful, unique and wonderfully presented. The only concern about this restaurant is, since it's a surprise menu (no menu), it's a bit risky for picky eaters. For example, if you or your date don't eat raw then I wouldn't suggest you this restaurant because there's a high chance that one or even two of the dishes contain raw meat/fish."}
{"text":"Creative menu and concept not executed as well as I'd hoped. Staff seemed overworked and exhausted when I was hoping for passion, creativity, and energy to match the food. Drinks took a bit of time. I hope they gain more staff and support to get this right. Enjoyed the meal but wasn't as memorable as we had hoped."}
