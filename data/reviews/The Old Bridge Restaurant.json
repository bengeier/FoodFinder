{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was delicious. Pear and gorgonzola pizza, chicken cordon blue, and truffle and cheese ravioli(we couldn't decide what we wanted so we got a lot!)"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding!  There are a fair amount of \"good\" restaurants around, but very few that you leave feeling like you had something really special -- but this is one of them.  I had the Chicken Piccata and my boyfriend had the Pork Chops with goat cheese, spinach and dried cranberries.  Both meals were exceptional.  The portions were a good size.  The service was great.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked absolutely delicious.  They were serving a lot of the wood-fired pizzas, mussels and huge salads.  Although the restaurant is new, the chef is clearly experienced at creating a fine dining experience for all."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened this week.  We stumbled upon it while looking for a place to have lunch.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  It looks like it has been recently remodeled.  It is a nice space with wood floors and metal chairs.  Their is a nice mural on one of the main walls.  The menu has a nice selection-appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, and entrees.  The desserts weren't listed but we found out are made in house.   Our server was very nice.  She went over some of the items available, but was a bit much with suggestive selling.  I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu Pizza and my husband ordered the Chicken Mazzacado sandwich.  They have a bright red pizza oven in the main area of the restaurant.  The pizzas are cooked fresh.  I would have preferred my pizza crust to be cooked just a little bit more.  The crust was nice.  It had a nice amount of ham and chicken on it.  It needed a little more Alfredo sauce.  I'm not one who likes things dripping with sauce so for me to say it needed more sauce tells you that it was lacking.  I felt the Pizza was one note.  I don't think the chicken had been seasoned at all.  So unless you got a bite with ham in it then it tasted bland.  I tasted the Mazzacado sandwich.  It has tomato, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, and grilled chicken.  My husband enjoyed it but we both agreed it needed more lettuce and a little less mozzarella.  The bread it was served on was nice but needed something a little more substantial to hold all of the ingredients.  I would definitely go back and try other menu items.  When restaurants are new they need time to tweak things."}
{"text":"This placed popped up on yelp as a new restaurant and we fingered we would check it out since we were visiting from out of town. We had stuffed peppers for an appetizer which was pretty good but the real star of the appetizers were the stuffed mushrooms. Yummy. We also had the house salad with the house dressing which was tasty with a sweet finish...thinking honey. The 4 of us each ordered a different pizza and I will list them in order of what we liked the most to the least...not that the least was bad. The Divine was our favorite, followed by the Italian, the cordon blue and last but not least the margherita pizza. Our service was good and would assume it will improve as they get a system in place. Would recommend this place if you are looking for fresh ingredients and well made pizzas."}
