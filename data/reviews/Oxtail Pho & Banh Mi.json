{"text":"So, we have eaten here 5 times since it opened. Every time it has been great. Even working through the normal new restaurant kinks (like training servers) had no impact to us as customers. Today I opted for the lemongrass pork chop with a side egg and side spring roll, which was very good and so filling. My husband had the red curry with beef (also delicious) and we shared a chicken satay banh mi. The banh mi was inhaled before we even thought about pictures... service was great and usual, oh and all that did not cost a small fortune."}
{"text":"This place is great!

I welcome any well-priced Asian restaurant into the neighborhood with open arms!

The food is good, the place is clean, and the service is quick. I'm totally on board with the prices as well.

This place is a perfect low-key and easy place for us to eat. I'm already looking forward to our next visit.

I recommend!"}

Found ourselves in a tight spot when we arrived at Golden Turtle and it was closed. This place is just a quick street car away and will do the job at satisfying your pho craving! A few notes if you are considering:

- try the oxtail pho. It's seriously good and still comes with all of that beefy broth you are likely looking for to comfort you
- their house special pho is only available in a large size and does not come with tendon or tripe. Not sure why they strayed away from tradition and have to say, I took points away for this
- May have just been my experience, but the cups they served water in smelt sour, as if they had been washed with an older cloth. A little nast but I made do without water for that evening

THE BOTTOM LINE: 100% will satisfy your pho craving and is a bit lesser known so you are getting the advantage of no wait."}
{"text":"Came to try the namesake oxtail pho, which was a bit underwhelming.  Seems like the broth is a hit-or-miss, depending on the day, and last weekend was a miss - although the oxtail was soft enough (not fall-off-the-bone, but definitely not chewy) but the broth was bland and could've used a heck of a lot more spices.  On the plus side, the seating is more comfortable and clean than most pho places I've been to!"}
{"text":"This place left me a bit conflicted. The service was good and I liked the feel of the restaurant (not traditional Vietnamese restaurant). Had to try the oxtail pho for which the restaurant is known for.  The broth was delicious. Overall though, I didn't feel I was getting bang for my buck which is why I like Pho so much. Great food at great value. At Oxtail I felt that the food was high quality, but the servings were smaller and the prices were a bit higher.  It's probably the healthier, more responsible pho choice, but that's not why we love pho, is it...?"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I love oxtail and I so wanted to love it!

first it was a super hot day and The air conditioning is just not working.

then I found out in order to get the oxtail soup it had to be a large size which I know I can it finish . I actually have to request for less noodle which is kinda silly but I didn't want to waste food.

I also got the spring rolls and my husband got the large special pho.

spring roll was excellent I have to say, crispy , very meaty tasting. It had glass noodle in there which I liked.

then the pho came. the soup was good. perfect tasting. The meat was so so. the oxtail  pieces were small and full of bones. I understand oxtail cost a lot but still I was disappointed. My husband also thought the meat in his bowl was overcooked.

may not come back again"}
{"text":"Great pho place! I had the house combination pho. Serving size was large. The broth was light yet savory. Fresh ingredients this a scrumptious dish. Love the spicy garlic side sauce. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here as i was curious about the Oxtail Pho. It was ok, though the soup's a bit oily. The oxtail was good portion & cooked right. Will likely come back to try the regular pho"}
{"text":"I ordered the oxtail pho. I found the soup base just mediocre. In fact, the soup base is not even as good as Ginger. The oxtail itself, however, was delicious and I enjoyed it very much. 

Overall, I find the place too expensive for the quality you get. The decor is nice and everything but they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the city. Amazing food, great vibe and prices that seem like too good to be true. Definite repeat."}
{"text":"After running some errands my sister suggested we stop by here for dinner as she really likes their Oxtail Pho. 
While we were waiting for our food, she decided to give me a brief history about this place. Like another yelper mentioned, it used to be a dingy Vietnamese Karaoke Bar. 

I ordered the house special pho and my sister ordered the ox tail pho. Our order came out fairly quick and everything tasted great. The bean sprouts and greens were fresh as well. The taste was great and portions are decent but I feel its a bit pricey. There are countless Pho restaurants in Toronto and GTA that tastes just as great or even better.

This restaurant is out of the way for me and if I was in the area and craving pho or banh mi, I'll definitely stop by but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here."}
{"text":"So I showed up due to the oxtail pho I read about somewhere out of curiosity 
1. Oxtail pho ran out at 7pm 
2. Service was very slow. 
3. The broth was SALTY SALTY, both mine, my friends were salty
4. We complained twice and they did nothing!! 
5. At the end there is ONLY 3 tips options 15%, 20% and 25% forcing you to choose these 3!!! 

I said I don't want to do that and put 0%"}
{"text":"I was her last week. The waitresses were very rude, pure customer service. Waitresses was talking in Vietnamese in a very rude way."}
{"text":"Really good and traditional food. I've? tried the Banh Mi but they have a lot to more on their menu. The service is also very good.

I will definitely come back to try some more."}
{"text":"Expensive. Not worth the price. Don't even try their Banh Mi. It was hideous. 6$ for a powdery bun and a thin thin thin slice of Cha Lua. Service was very slow. First and also last time!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for some pretty decent Vietnamese food.  We ordered a small pho with rare beef, a lemongrass pork belly banh mi, pork spring rolls and pints of Stella. 

The broth for the pho was nicely aromatic and not salty like another reviewer suggested. There was a good depth of flavour. However, my noodles were clumped together. Seems like a bit of an amateur move. Some of the slices of beef were more like chunks, so minus a point there. 

The pork belly banh mi was delicious. The pork belly in the sandwich was more like thin slices of marinated pork though and not like the pork belly at Banh Mi Boys, so don't expect little slabs. The baguette seemed like it was toasted. Mmm... and geez Louise only $5.

Spring rolls ok-meh. Pints were not pints, but those little Stella glasses.

The real winner here is the relaxed environment. Oxtail Pho and Banh Mi is definitely not the typical loud Viet joint. No screaming babies as per usual like at my favourite pho joint in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Oxtail pho is so amazing. I dine in, take out or Order in! Haven't had pho anywhere else since eating here. Very accommodating if you have any alterations as long as it is possible."}
{"text":"I decided to try their popular Oxtail Pho which is a one-size Large bowl for $13. Wait time was +15min which is unusually long. It has daikon, meatballs, 5x oxtails, and side order of herbs + bean sprouts as toppings.

   The menu is fairly simple in terms of  description, and is very lacking in photos. Back-side of menu has pics of elements of pho but it is for illustration only."}
{"text":"Love this neighbourhood gem! Bright and yellow, great place for a hot pho in the winter or a vermicelli bowl in the summer. Good spice. Love the Satay Pho and the meat spring rolls. Chicken wings are also good for sharing. The owner Linda is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Flavourful broth, fresh ingredients, quality meat. 

First time here, ordered a Pho Nam which is well done brisket and deep fried spring rolls. 

The soup was very good, one of the best I've had. Very flavourful and it didn't seem to have much MSG. The meat was good quality. Spring rolls were one of my favourite, extra crispy on the outside. My only complaint is the lack of noodles. 

The price is reasonable, $7 for small pho, $9 for large, $5 for 2 spring rolls."}
{"text":"Tried this resto courtesy of the Bent-Lee brothers (Chef Susur Lee's sons) and I am nothing short of a satisfied customer. The place itself is super cute and clean (big fan of the yellow) - minimalistic appeal with simple but modern decor and they carried it down all the way to the washrooms. We were greeted upon arrival and got to sit anywhere we liked. The menu is straight forward with prices and ingredients all laid out. We got the lemongrass chicken vermicelli, lemongrass pork belly vermicelli, crispy pork springrolls and vietnamese iced coffee. I definitely recommend the lemongrass chicken; they're larger pieces and juicy AND the crispy pork springrolls (best I've had thus far). The vermicelli was fresh and you can taste the freshness of the veggies as well. The portions are good and I didn't feel disgustingly full after eating Viet food which I typically would at other places. Didn't get to try what they're most famous for, oxtail pho, but it's just another reason to come back."}
{"text":"In a city chock-full of Vietnamese restaurants, this was a great find. Slight in appearance & unassuming, we weren't sure if we ordered at the counter or there was waiter service (it was the latter). But Oxtail certainly delivers on the food! Great spring rolls, wonderful chicken with basil, tasty pad thai, all fresh and served by a very friendly, polite staff. We had a lovely experience and will certainly return."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Pretty stoked to have these guys in the neighbourhood. As others have said, the great thing about this place is the vibe/atmosphere: chilled out, lots of natural light, pleasant, bright, thoughtful decor. Add to that friendly service, good wifi, decent music, bowls of delicious pho for $7 and $4 bottles of Canadian. I also LOVE that this is one of the few pho places that lets you get grilled chicken thigh in your soup--that smoky grill flavour gets all up in the broth and it's SO. GOOD. So what's not to like? Well, a couple of things: My biggest gripe is that I wish you could get their \"special\" soups in the smaller size: I love Bun Bo Hue and would be interested to try the Oxtail house special, but $13 is more than I want to pay for a bowl of pho, especially one that I will never be able to finish (I have enough trouble finishing the small size). Other than that, my complaints are pretty minor: pints of Stella for $6.50 are not actually pints but smaller, and often come with a ton of froth. Avoid takeout here--the portions are much smaller than you get when eating in. I could do with a little more greenery (onions, herbs etc) with the pho, but I guess you could always ask for more. My husband thinks the banh mi are a little on the sweet/sugary side. Overall, though, I am glad they're here--a great, non-hipster addition to the Dundas strip, and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Vietnamese food with reasonable prices. Still waiting to try their pho but I had a great experience with their fresh rolls and viet iced coffee. Unlike other cafes in the area who claim they serve viet ice coffee, you can imagine the one here are pretty legit. Staff is super friendly and helpful. When I had a hard time determining what kind of fresh roll to get, the staff offered me 2 different types in one order so it was a nice thoughtful gesture. Will return!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming - the first time was just after they had opened and I thought the oxtail pho was quite good but expensive for what it was. Today I took an oxtail pho to go and was very disappointed. The quality was drastically different- almost no meat on the scrawny pieces of oxtail- mostly bone. The broth wasn't very flavourful this time either. In my opinion a good pho broth shouldn't even need any hoisin or lime or sriracha. Sadly this one was so bland I needed to use extra sauces to make it have a taste. And the meatballs in the oxtail soup were inedible- they were so hard and rubbery I spat out my one bite. Definitely not worth the $13 + tax when you can get bigger and tastier pho just about anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"Really weird but this place used to be a ghetto karaoke spot. I came here for pho cuz I heard it was new and it was highly recommended by friends. When I sat inside I felt that the place was really familiar and realized I had been here in its past life. LOL!

I ordered the oxtail pho and an ice coffee and I was blown away. Their oxtail meat is super tender! I'm pretty sure they sousvide the oxtail, which is why it's red in color but perfectly tender. I also added an egg to my pho which is such a big plus. Broth was really good as well. Their coffee is amazing. I also ordered one Togo I loved it so much.

I ended up coming here 5 days in a row on my vacation. It sounds ridiculous I know. Now since I did come 5 days in a row, I noticed that the consistency changed pretty often.

First day was great, 2nd day broth tasted kind of old. 3rd day broth tasted too new. 4th day was good, 5th day was good. For that I knocked it down to 4 stars... 

I will definitely always come back though and highly recommend it to others.

Banh mi here is also good."}
