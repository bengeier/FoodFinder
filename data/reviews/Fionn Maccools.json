{"text":"I checked out the new location at Trinity Commons in Brampton.   Not only was the food great, the service was better than I have received anywhere in a long time.  Our server was a lovely girl named Jamie and she deserves special recognition.   She checked on our table often, refilled drinks, brought the food out quickly and had a great attitude the entire time.    We were really impressed with her service and I let the manager know on my way out that this girl is gold - she was a real superstar."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for drinks and apps early in the evening. I got the Strawberry Fruli to drink which was priced very reasonably compared to other restaurants I've got this from. To share we got the Blarney Chips which were very delicious although I don't think they give enough salsa and sour cream with it.   We sat on the patio which was quite empty when we first got there around 6:30pm. At first I was very pleased with our server until towards the end. Since there weren't many people on the patio, our server did not come by our table for a while even after we finished eating and drinking. When she finally came we asked for our bill and she brought out our bill and said she will be right back with the debit machine. I think we waited about 10 mins and no one came by so we can pay. We finally got tired of waiting so we went inside with the receipt. Our waitress saw us at the bar and asked if we wanted to pay. I think she actually forgot that we were still waiting for her to bring us the machine.   Overall the food was good and they had a live DJ inside but I was not pleased at all with the service. Maybe next time my experience will be better."}
{"text":"Great experience! Super friendly staff!  For appetizer I ordered the fry cauliflower and my mom got the chowder soup. This was my first time having fried cauliflower and I loved it on my goodness I could not stop eating it my mom also loved her soup and she said it was extremely filling  For my main course I got the card sandwich and my mom got the power bowl both were really great to be House made tartar sauce on the codfish was super delicious and the parable was the sauce that they used on the power bowl was a good compliment"}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere were all pretty good at this location. My only disappointment was the dessert (all options) was rather underwhelming compared to the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Considering I went here twice within 3 weeks I would say that I really enjoy this place, especially this location since it's near my house. The service has been amazing both times but I will talk about my most recent visit.  I met my friend here for lunch on a Monday and on Mondays they have their pie special which is any pie (Shepherd's, Chicken, etc.) with a side for only $10.99. My friend got the Guinness Steak and Mushroom Pie and I got the Salmon Leek Pie. I would have gotten the same thing as him but all the calorie counts freak me out. I've had the steak and mushroom pie before and it was delicious. The salmon leek pie I had this time was very tasty as well. The flavours just worked very well together and was salted just right for my palate.  I would so come here again if I'm looking for pub food!"}
