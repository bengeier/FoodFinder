{"text":"Food is ok but service was awful. 3 plates in 1 hour. Classic be cheap by waiting out your guests. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Don't hesitate to try this place out. The service is good and friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty. It's located right behind Tim Horton's and kind of hidden away so not many have found this hidden gem yet"}
{"text":"$13.95 for AYCE lunch, $4 extra if you want to add sashimi. Sushi was only okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Decor was lacking as was the very very slow service. What usually takes us 30 mins to eat took us atleast 1.5hrs."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I quite like it. The interior isn't gorgeous but it's also not a dump, so it really doesn't bother me that much.   I eat the all you can eat sushi at lunch and I put away a lot of sushi for $13.99 so I think it's worth it. The fish is pretty fresh and the rice is well cooked.   The staff here is very small, from what I've seen it's one hostess/server, one sushi chef and one hot food chef in the back. I've never been there during rush hour so I'm not sure how fast the food comes out but when I went, they stagger the dishes that we order so I never really feel like I'm waiting forever for a dish to come out since I'm already eating another dish.   Today we ordered (approximately):  Miso soup (Standard quality) Deep fried tofu (My god, I'm in love with this appetizer. Seriously, the deep fry is perfect and I love the contrast with the soft tofu) Deep fried scallops (With the deep fry and the shape and the fact that they serve it with ketchup, I thought they were chicken nuggets at first) California roll Rainbow roll Dynamite roll Red Dragon roll Crispy mango roll (This is actually so yummy and a refreshing change from the other savoury sushi rolls) Salmon sushi  Crab sushi (Made with imitation crab meat, but that's pretty normal) Crispy Spicy roll (Yeah, the menu didn't specify but my mom felt adventurous, turns out it's with cream cheese)  Urbanspoon's reviews of this place are very split, people either like it or they don't. Some of them have complained about the service, but I've never experienced that, it's weird. Then again, my mom started chatting with the sushi cook and the server and it turns out they're from the same province. The two are really quite friendly and they told us that the majority of their customers are regulars.  Either way, the food is 8.5/10 and for the price we paid for all you can eat sushi, I'm frequenting this place a lot more in the future.  PS. They also have a 2 for 1 AYCE special on Mondays and Tuesdays so 3 people can eat for approximately $10 each, not including a drink."}
