{"text":"Went to Pasqual's tonight.   Chips and salsa were great. Main course was very good.  The service was TERRIBLE....    Ordered a tap beer, took 10 minutes to arrive!! Our waitress was missing most of the night!! She had 3 tables in our area and each table complained about her poor service!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Pasqual's house margarita with orange juice-- strong, with good flavor!  Their chips are phenomenal. So fresh and well-seasoned! Salsa tastes fresh too, though the \"hot\" isn't particularly hot. Also, I don't get why they offer you mild, hot, or extra hot... Isn't it really just mild, medium, or hot then? Details...  I'll be honest, I usually get the same things here, but they don't disappoint. Their black bean soup and white chicken chili are fabulous. Served with blue corn bread and cheese-filled corn quesadillas, respectively. They are very flavorful and always served piping hot.  I've had tamales here, which were also good. Friends have reported that their massive burritos and veggie enchiladas were delicious.    Servers are always attentive and friendly, and willing to split checks. They can even split a chip basket up as many ways as you want!"}
{"text":"I went here after work with some co-workers.  We arrived at about 6:00pm on a Tuesday and there were six of us.  We were told there would be a half hour wait for a table so we found some space to sit at the bar.  All of the employees were very courteous and drink service was fast.      Food is another story though.  While at the bar, I ordered nachos which took them about 25 minutes to bring out to us, not exactly fast service, especially for an appetizer that should take no more than 10-15 minutes to make, even if the restaurant is busy.  The nachos themselves were decent, but nothing special.  Another co-worker ordered chips and salsa (which they charge for, by the way).  The chips were definitely from a bag, so I was a little disappointed as I like when restaurants serve them freshly fried, especially if they are going to charge.  My overall take on the chips and the salsa; again, it wasn't bad, but not that great either.  The waitress did offer us a free refill on the chips (another A+ for service!).  I also ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce which was good, but not great.  As far as drinks go, I've never had a margarita before, and margaritas were half off so I decided to give it a try.  It was alright but nothing fantastic, however that might just be because I'm not a huge fan of mixed drinks.  My co-workers seemed to really enjoy the drinks that they got.    In summary, I would give this place 5 stars for the service and atmosphere, but only 2-3 for the food.  Honestly, it's a nice place to get a drink with friends, but the food, although palatable, is nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this place, great tequila list. I had the Santa's Helper seasonal margarita, I was worried it might be too sweet but it was perfect.  The black bean soup with blue corn bread was delicious as well. Perfect break from shopping."}
{"text":"Soup  and chili were adequate for upper Midwest pretensions to Mexican food. Those who ordered the tacos plates seemed to enjoy them.  The sliders (from the bar menu), on the other hand, were obviously a tribute to another Madison institution -  the UW hockey team.  Hard, dry, and tasteless. First reaction of one who ordered them - this tastes like a hockey puck.  If I were a betting man, I'd wager the line cooks pressed down on the ground beef while grilling, a sure way to squeeze out the flavor.  Amateur hour. Not a food that would encourage me to linger and have another drink.  If you want sliders, go back to White Castle."}
{"text":"I never liked pasquals at all. No locations- nothing!  Never had good food or drinks there. Never. But all of our favorite places were packed for fish fry and my guy convinced me to try out the new one on east wash and pasqual's had plenty of room for us at the bar.  I didn't order main food because I know it is awful but I did order off the street menu. The veggie taco was really good! I ordered a margarita and it was horribly sweet. The bartender that originally waited on us was awful. Just not present no pulse.  But then this other pony tail old dude helped me out. Listened to my sweetness issues and made me a fab drink! He saved my experience and I had a really good time! I even ordered another taco! Thank you pony tail dude you are awesome! I'll be back for happy hour and veggie taco when u work!"}
{"text":"If you want Mexican food that is more authentic then go to Taco Bell. If you want small portion sizes with enough salt to kill 1000 slugs and pay $2.50 for a soft drink that they will never refill then come to this place!  Ordered a double combination fajita and there was probably 10 pieces of meat on it along with about 2 tablespoons of beans and 1/4 cup of rice... and I'm not exaggerating either. The plate was probably a 10in platter plate and 1/4 of the plate was grated cheese piled on... nice filler there. Needless to say it was no where near enough food to feed 2 people and you get to pay $20 for the privilege.   We went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was half full yet our waitress was incredible inattentive. Drinks were never refilled after asking for them (and why would you ever have to ask!?) and they ended up charging us for kids drinks even though the menu said they were included. There was a larger party on the deck and I saw them TWICE come inside and have to ask for things because the same waitress wasn't even attending to them.  Overall this was a really bad experience and I will never give them another try. Don't waste your time with this place and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Rock solid dinner for families in the Regent neighborhood. I like their margaritas a lot!"}
{"text":"Worst service Ever!!! Always! This place really is a joke, I have no idea how it stays in business. We use to come here all the time but the service is just so terrible not sure why we came again. Servers are rude and the young manager is awful!!! It takes 5 minutes for someone to even come to your table.. Plus if you come in the evening they will practically kick you out because they don't want you sitting around and drinking here. If you sit here too long at night they will shut the parking lot lights off on you! Then you can walk out to your car in the pitch dark!! Great customer service. If you live in Verona everyone knows what awful service this place has, it is too bad because the good is good."}
{"text":"Dined early on a Saturday evening. Service was fine, ambience fine, ran into friends--perfect neighborhood night out. Too bad the kitchen didn't deliver even acceptable fare. Appetizers: Why can't chips be warm, cheese dip warmer? Mains: the enchilada was okay but carnitas had too much cinnamon, green chili sauce was unremarkable. And why can't cook follow server's note on diner's choice of beans? Why can't fish tacos have more than an overcooked finger of fish? Why all that cabbage slaw I'm still trying to digest?   Wanted to disprove other reviews but nope, have to join the chorus."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience today.  Food took an hour to arrive.  There were quite a few people who arrived after us, ate, and left, all before we got our food.  Compensation was a glass of beer and some chips (which should be free anyway), but to be fair, we didn't ask for any entrees to be removed from the bill or anything like that.  The waitress was somewhat apologetic, but she didn't actually offer the free items; a woman who must have been the manager saw how long we were waiting and offered us the refills/chips.  The food was quite good as always, but I'm afraid that after receiving poor service on almost every occasion, I'm not headed back here."}
{"text":"This is the first Mexican restaurant I went to that did not serve complementary chips and salsa. The higher priced portions of enchiladas and shrimp tacos (I think it was) only serve two where everywhere else I go its three.  Factoring that all in its too high priced for me, especially since it is nothing special at all.  Our waitress was very nice though."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but if you don't like your margarita supersweet this is not the place for you. And they're not very strong either! Going next-door to watch the sugar taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Sloooooowwwwwest service eeevvvvverrrrr.....  Update: Two tables that came in after us got their food. Waited 40 minutes for our food then had to hunt down someone to tell them we were leaving. Never going back.   We typically go to the Draft House across the street but  thought we would try something different. I would recommend passing on Pasquals and going to the Draft House if you're in the area. We've always had a good experience there."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow, the chips are bland and the margaritas were just ok. They messed up our order and still tried to charge us for the duplicate chimichanga. I had high hopes, but I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is good - a step above Chipotle but not better than an average sit-down Mexican restaurant. Took 20+ minutes to get food after ordering. The room was really overheated and uncomfortable, with full sun through the windows and no shades (and maybe broken AC?) Made for an overall uncomfortable meal, especially with the longish wait. Good Tex-Mex food but not worth the discomfort."}
{"text":"Service was really slow today. It took 25 minutes to get chips and dip that came in a plastic container. It's Mothers Day and they were totally unprepared for the crowd. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good tex mex. great margaritas."}
{"text":"Average to below average southwestern food at above average prices. Uninspired tacos, nachos and salsa. Rice and beans were decent.  We visited for Sunday lunch/brunch. Slow service, even though the restaurant was less than half full. The brunch menu featured a $7 Bloody Mary. It was tasteless and terrible. The waiter asked how the drinks were and we told him the drink was bad. He apologized and said he would let the bar manager know. The drink was almost full when he took it. The bar manager did not offer to make it again and we were charged $7 for a couple of sips. Even though the margaritas were decent, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. While I prefer Mexican food to Tex-Mex, I am always willing to try something new. Pasquals becomes expensive after you add in the price of chips plus salsa to try to give the food some flavor. Everything I tried lacked flavor and the servers were incompetent. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always like Pasqual's. I've tried almost everything on the menu and he only thing I haven't liked is the tamale. I have a feeling that's mostly because I don't like tamales. One complaint I have is that they got rid of the espresso-type coffees they used to have.   The food almost always comes out quickly and is the perfect temperature. Everything is nicely flavored, and the portions are large and filling. They do have some lighter options, such as the black bean soup. My personal favorite is the tostada with chicken; it's the perfect cold-winter-day meal.  Service is usually friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere is fairly nice. The decorations are a bit odd and it's not the most comfortable place. Also, sometimes the music is a little loud and doesn't always fit the Southwestern environment Pasqual's tries to exude. Other than those small complaints, though, I highly recommend making a lunch stop at Pasqual's."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all. And, this was my second time giving this location a chance.   When we first arrived, my fiancé and I waited about 5 minutes to be seated or even acknowledged. From there, the wait for our server was another 5-10 minutes. We ordered our drinks and again, waited another 15 minutes for them to even be served to us (the bar was not very busy) and to have our order taken.  I ordered chicken tacos and my first bite was, eh, okay. The server came and asked how we were and I politely responded \"fine!\". After the next couple bites I really didn't like the tacos at all. When I expressed the fact that I was I unsatisfied with my tacos she didn't seem to be too concerned and asked my Fiancé if we wanted to eat them. He told her he didn't really like them either so she took them away.   After we received the bill, we were charged full price for my meal. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to be polite in the beginning but, I was a little shocked when she charged us full price for a meal  we both didn't like, without even offering us something different. By that time though, we were already tired of waiting for service.  I've never been to any other locations for dining but, I don't think we will be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Always a disappointment!   The food always makes me feel like I can make it at home which defeats the entire purpose of going out for dinner. The main reason I have gone back is because my friends enjoys the margaritas and I am always willing to give a place with tacos another go. Everytime has been a let down.   Honestly its my least favorite place in Madison."}
{"text":"My dude and I go here about once a week. Can't get enough. Margaritas are great, food is super tasty, service is fast. The only complaint I have is it's super cold. Bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes for drinks at the bar, 35 minutes for food that had very obviously been sitting waiting under the heat lamps. It was hard enough for our waiter to bring us the drinks we ordered, so I didn't bother with telling him that our steak fajita burritos were more beans than steak. Which may have been good since the steak was chewy. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what exactly has happened, but something has changed at Pasquals. Unfortunately not for the better...   I have waited a long time before addding this update - I wanted to make sure I was being fair to them.    The service has really gone down hill!   I cannot believe how long we have had to wait to order and then receive our food.  Again, to be be fair to them, we keep coming back.  However we are going to take a seriously long break from Pasquals.  The last time it took 45 minutes to receive our food once we ordered it.  We have young children.  One of the appeals of Pasquals has always been how family friendly they are.  45 Minutes is too long for young kids to sit waiting for food.  People around us were equally frustrated.  One couple asked to cancel their meals/order because it was taking so long and they had a movie to catch.  Another couple had to corner the server when she was at the wait station just to pay their bill.    Finally...  get some shades for those windows!!  It is ridiculous that people have to sit there and be blinded."}
{"text":"Service and food were both excellent tonight.  A good number of vegetarian options; I recommend the black bean soup (which comes with an excellent blue corn muffin) with one or two of the tacos on the Street Food menu.  Stick to the more traditional tex-mex meals and you'll be fine (I don't dig olives in my tacos). $4 chips and salsa are a drag, and they're not good enough to justify the cost, but overall a better value than nearby Tex Tubbs.  It's a huge space so there's tons of room - would be great place to entertain a group, or just to ensure a shorter wait for a table."}
{"text":"The best black bean burrito to be found in Madison.  Spicy, but not a bio-hazard. Silky,  nicely textured filling- just the right amount of cheese, I'd say.  An excellent rice and bean accompaniment.  So affordable, I hope they can sell enough of them to pay for their remodeling. Very tasteful decor!  (I was covetous of the lighting fixtures.) Update...I have sadly turned away from Pasqual's east carryout because I have on several occasions now gotten their answering machine during the supper hour. I have even left my number to have them call me back, but they did not. I concluded that pickup is just not their thing. When I do manage to get through, they seem a little surprised by my order.  I do still recommend dining in!"}
{"text":"The bar service is extremely hit or miss. I have been at the bar and the gentlemen not acknowledge me within ten minutes of chilling in front of him. However the management and other servers have outdown themselves other times so concistency would be the only issue. I love their margs. and have been going to them since their original location on monroe st."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to Pasqual's was for my birthday, and it turned out to be a great choice. We hadn't made a reservation for our group of eight anywhere as we were waiting to see how the weather would turn out, and Pasqual's was able to accommodate us quickly and easily (granted, it was 7:00 on a Sunday with icky weather). Our service was quick and helpful, frequently checking in our drink status. We all started with the chips and salsa/guacamole, because the seasoning blend on the chips at Pasqual's is the stuff my dreams are made out of. Most of us had their seasonal margarita at the time, a cranberry-orange variety that was dangerously delicious. As always, the portions were enormous and most of us ended up taking a lot home. I've been to the various Pasqual's locations many times over the years (and frankly, in 2013 it might have been my most often default location) and can't come up with a complaint."}
{"text":"Love Pasqual's. We eat here regularly. The margaritas are top notch. They always have fun seasonal margaritas.  Chips, salsa and guacamole are great while waiting. Try the chili cheese dip too, it is outstanding. Fajitas are very good. Always enough for lunch the next day. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Great salsa. Lousy bland Guac. Bad Margies.... Who serves a margarita in a cocktail glass??? Tastes like bad lemonade. Soda is flat.   Slow service. Had to ask other employees (other than our absent waiter) for a refill of chips and water. Waited 45 minutes for my tacos. Cold meat. Steak tacos fair. Shrimp tacos bad."}
{"text":"Great that Pasquals took over the old Fyfes Bistro!  The bar area is great.  When we got sat in what is slmist a varn like area adjacent to E. Wash Ave, things went down hill.  The noise level was out of control.   People where yelling, louder than a Badger game while eating on a Fridsy night.  The wait staff are good - no complaints.   I will not be back unless I sit in a quieter area.  Great food snd staff, very poor surroundings."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Pasqual's food for years, and when they finally returned to the east side of Madison I was thrilled. Their quality of food is consistent and and the flavor profiles are a solid 8/10 for tex-mex (It's not too rough on the pocketbook either) The newer menu items were a little disappointing in my experience (\"street tacos\" are too small, boo-hoo) so I recommend ordering off the core menu (\"Pasqual's\" tacos, enchiladas, burritos, nachos). The taste of their shredded chicken and beef has not changed in 30 years, and it was as delicious as I remember it at the Atwood avenue location.  They serve,by far, the best margaritas in Madison.    You may wait for a table during prime hours,because it can get pretty busy on the weekends, but you can say that about any restaurant.I would recommend Pasqual's Cantina to anyone looking for a good casual dining experience."}
{"text":"The terrible service began when we walked in the door. The hostess was so disinterested in her job that I wasn't even certain the restaurant was open yet. However, it was 5pm. It took forever for our waiter  to come to the table for our drink and appetizer order. The food and drinks arrived quickly, but we also received the appetizer for the table behind us. I had to flag down the waiter to order our entrees, and he got the order wrong. I think one waiter was working the entire dining room.   The food was awful. How you can screw up tacos, refried beans and Spanish rice is beyond me, but they did. The spices for the beef (very tough) were terrible, and the same criticism rings true for the beans and rice.   I'd been here before shortly after they opened at this location. They've lost it since then.   $40 for awful food and terrible service. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Music way too loud.   Ran out of water. Waiter never showed back up until we were done. Little late to ask how things are. Also, it always bothers me when the waiter isn't the one bringing out the food. They lose the connection with the customer.  Mexican restaurant with no chips? What's up with that?  Food quality mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was so bad all i really want to say is nah I'm good. If you want to know what kind of deals they have, your answer is nah I'm good. If you think to yourself \"i want good Mexican food today\" and want to try this place... nah you're good taco bell is a better place to get Mexican food. All in all.... nah I'm good."}
{"text":"Decent food, half price margaritas on Mondays and Tuesdays - the original margarita is so good!   They have a nice outdoor area.  Their homemade chips and salsa are also so delicious."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it.  The good parts. They were very busy and while seated at the bar we did not wait long for our food. Very tasty Lemon Basil Marg. Hilldale is a handy location.   Not great parts. The wait staff acted like they couldn't be bothered. My Tamale came and had to have been wrapped in baby corn. When I commented that it was very small my waiter informed me I could order more if one wasn't enough. I tipped like I had just stopped in for a cocktail.  A first for me."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service. Great margaritas, half price on Mon and Tues. Otherwise-pricey at $8 each."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now for either dinner or just drinks with friends. It is a nice spot (close to home) to sit out on the patio for drinks and chips. However, the service is typically slow."}
{"text":"The experience here was very mixed. The food (guacamole burrito and fish tacos) was great. But service was spotty. The waiter seemed inexperienced but he tried hard. No ice in our water glasses on a hot day. He informed us that they don't have a blender to make frozen margaritas with.  He mixed up the hot salsa with the mild. The in-house sangria had plenty of alcohol in it but it seemed that they made it in a hurry rather than letting the fruit infuse into the wine slowly, meaning that there wasn't a lot of fruit flavoring in the drink.  No signs showing where the restrooms were (up a steep flight of stairs). Very loud in the restaurant because there's no carpeting (brick floors). The view of empty lots is terrible. Some window decorations might solve that.  Pasqual's just opened recently.  I think with time they'll fix their problems. We'll certainly try them again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on here. Let it be known we will be back as the location, margs & guac are tough to beat, but service & hit or miss food is mind boggling. Heaven forbid you stay later than 9 pm...they will put up chairs right around you - even with the restaurant 1/2 full!! Something has changed with the rice - it is extremely spicy. It used to always have a kick, but not sweat-rolling-from-your-forehead hot. Carnitas are dry more than not.   It is turning in to just a margs, chips & guac stop for us which is fine, but they're missing a huge market by providing inconsistent food, laissez-faire service & complete shut down of the joint at 9 pm."}
{"text":"Food was OK.....Service was WOW!!!!!  NOT in a good way!  Our waiter clearly had a rough night the evening before or something.  Totally disheveled, not really with it, had a little trouble communicating, a little smelly, got our order totally wrong and took a long time to be served what we didn't order.  We were actually a little embarrassed for the young man.  I could go on but lets just say it was not very impressive."}
{"text":"First time at the Washington Ave location....bottom line...for the cost,  you can do better elsewhere.  Just don't like having to pay for chips and salsa....and theirs are not that outstanding to warrant the charge. Other \"extras\" also make the dining experience less enjoyable.  Outdoor patio overlooking parking lot is large, indoor bar area is very NICE with some table for eating in that space.  Main dining area is NOISEY....I would NOT go here if you wish to have a nice dinner conversation.  They need some window coverings/ acoustic tiles/ etc to absorb some noise.  Overall won't  make it a destination for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Good food, good margatitas. Their chips and guacamole are the best. Try the cucumber margarita, you want be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and I love the fajita's at this place! They do a wonderful job making fajitas. The ambiance and service are good. I had my bday once and came with my bf and later with my mom. Always ordered fajitas, always loved it   If you want to order cocktails, get their seasonal ones soits made out of fresh fruits."}
{"text":"Well. This was a PR disaster from the start. We call ahead for a group of 9. I'm a UW med school grad who used to come here and was excited to sit outside with some great margaritas like the days of old. We arrive and were told we could no longer call ahead for a table. Strange we weren't told this on the phone. Regardless, we were happy to sit inside and have some drinks before moving outside. We order food and 4 tables on the patio open up. Excellent, we are told we could probably sit out there next. Then, we are told since we already ordered the food inside we cannot move outside. Our waitress was very sweet and really the only reason we stayed. I would understand if it was busy, but since it's 2pm, I'm just disappointed by the excuses and unwillingness to accommodate your customers..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent a good time debating where to go for dinner last Saturday. We hadn't planned to go out, but neither of us wanted to cook. We ran down a list of restaurants we hadn't tried and settled on Pasqual's because it was nearby. Also, since it was Saturday, we could easily go to other places if the wait was too long.  It turns out, they had immediate seating. I think the inside is fun and colorful. It is a little cavernous, but they have a lot of natural light shining in and low booth walls mean few dark spots. However, this night included a table full of twelve screaming middle schoolers, turning the interior into an echo chamber. So we sat outside.  As previous reviewers mentioned, all of the staff didn't look much older than those kids at the table inside, but they were very sharp and helpful. I thought they did well.  I tried just the single tamale, and my girlfriend had the soup with bluecorn bread. This sounded like a light meal, but with the beans and rice and salsa & chips on that came with it made for a pretty big dinner. I thought the food was great and will come back again."}
{"text":"Tried the new Pasqual's last week and was very disappointed. We started with the chips and guacamole ($6.95). I enjoy Pasqual's salsa, but the guacamole was very citrus-y. The chips were way oversalted. Nevertheless, we would have appreciated an offer of more chips which were served on a plate rather than in a basket. My companion ordered a steak burrito which was adequate. It was helped by a side order of new mexican chile (upcharge). I had the shrimp tacos which were sub-standard. The meager shrimp were overpowered by a cabbage slaw which was very bitter and overly citrus flavored. The tortillas were dry and lacking flavor. The sides of beans were not warm enough and somewhat crusted on the plate. The rice was lacking flavor, other than heavily salted.  We each had a glass of Sangria, which was okay, but overpriced at $6.95 per glass. The total bill was $45. This was massively overpriced considering the poor quality of the food.  We are disappointed because we love the Fyfe's space and it is decorated quite nicely with a good amount of space between tables (in the bar). It's hard to imagine many people returning after trying the food."}
{"text":"Dirty! Floors were filthy, abandoned plates left on the bar and terrible service. The highlight was a tasty margarita."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, I LOVE Pasqual's! The semi-casual atmosphere perfectly matches the food in my opinion. Everytime I go there, I order the Fajita platter with Steak for my meat choice. It is literally all I get, besides Nacho's or an occasional burrito. Just thinking about it is making me want to go there! I like that it isn't  a greasy, very fast foodish mexican restauraunt but instead healthier. yum!  The reason I have to give only 3 stars I because of the service. I usually expect to be sitting for about 5 minutes before the server comes over, another 5 to bring back water, 10 to return to take the order... But then the food comes quick, in 8-10 minutes. Then I'll be done sitting there forever waiting for the check, because I have places to go, and then they will finally come back making what could have been a 25 minute lunch break one hour- which annoys me personally. I think they need to hire more servers during the busy lunch hour (12-2).   But other than that love it"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at this place, but after tonight, I will think twice about going back.  My Mom and I sat at the bar and the bartender that was serving our section ignored us for what seemed like 15 minutes, until we finally caught her attention.  I ordered my drink and she rolled her eyes at me and was completely put off.  I proceeded to order chips and salsa and she seemed even more annoyed.  There were two bartenders working, I want to make it clear that it was the blonde and not the brunette.  I'd mention her name, but she didn't offer it and I didn't feel like waiting another 15 minutes to grab her attention to ask.  To me, customer service is one of the key ingredients to a successful business, and if your bartenders are apathetic and don't have the time of day to acknowledge their customers, it might be time to assess the staff that you hire to represent your business.  #notcomingback"}
{"text":"I ordered two tacos  How can you mess that up in a Mexican restaurant?  They did.  It was really bad.  Service wasn't great and it was way overpriced.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good dining experience at Pasqual's.  It's a big, industrial type building but don't let appearances deceive.  The food is great, the drinks are great, and the prices are reasonable.  Being able to eat outside on their porch in the summer makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Sat and waited for an outside table at the bar and experienced a woman bartender with a huge chip!  The waiteress made up for the bad bartender however the food was mediocre at best!  They charge for chips and salsa and the salsa is serves in a dixie cup sized plastic cup. I had the fish tacos which were soggy like they had been warmed up in a microwave with no flavor what so ever, The guacamole was like wall paper paste and the black beans and rice were served cold and lumpy.  Im truly upset they have let this place slide, I use to dream about their cowboy burrito...They need to get back to basics!"}
{"text":"Pasquals is pretty good at all locations- except THIS one. The service here is so bad. The first time I came, I came at about 2pm and stood for a good 5 minutes at the awkwardly located host stand. The bartender, and the two servers who were in the other rooms clearly saw me and did not come to seat me since the host was m.i.a.. Finally the host came, I was sat, service was meh, food was still good.   The second time I came back, hoping to experience better. Same dismal service. There was 1 host and 1 server working with 7 tables. Not even a bartender was on yet. (it was 4pm). This man was running around crazy and of course his service was so horrible because he had way too much on his plate.   Both times I went I never saw a manager. This location has got to get it together. They might as well make it a counter service place with how horrible the servers are, possibly due to the fact that is doesn't seem to be properly managed by anyone.   I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I used to love this place. We have a handful of restaurants that we try to visit at least every few months and Pasqual's used to be on the top of our list. Last November we came here and experienced some of the worst CS I have ever been given. My girlfriend's food was lacking(to say the least). When the non-existent server came to check on us and saw my girlfriend's food barely touched, the server just asked if she was finished and took the plate. The server never asked how the food was or if there was something wrong. Decided to come back a few weeks ago and give it another chance. The dining area was for the most part full but there was no wait. We were seated and promptly ordered drinks and nachos for appetizer. We got our drinks quickly but little did we know we had a 45 minute wait ahead of us for our nachos. After about 30 minutes we finally got our waitresses attention and she said it would be out soon. 10 minutes after that we stopped the manager and she assured us the nachos were coming. Keep in mind it's now taken 40 minutes to receive chips with cheese melted on top. 45 minutes in we received the nachos and about 20 minutes later we got our entrees. The food was brought out by a random employee. In my restaurant experience, late food or food to a table who has issues was always brought out by a manager or the original server at a minimum. We could hear the other tables around us complaining as well.The manager stated the kitchen staff was new but if she knew that, wouldn't you stop seating? We were never told before hand that the wait was long or that the food would take longer than usual. Our waitress swept the floor directly next to us while we ate but never stopped to ask how the food was or apologize for the delay. First non-tip of my life and I wasn't proud of it. Our restaurant list got shorter that evening."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Every Time. This time we waited over an hour for food. As always the excuse was \"sorry we are understaffed\". Won't be back."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not sure why people are so against this location for Pasquals.  Yes, the space has a more industrial look from the outside but I find the inside to be perfectly comfortable and inviting.  The service at the restaurant has always been exceptional as the servers are outgoing and friendly.   Now, in terms of the actual food I am going to go as far as to say that the kitchen staff at this location of Pasquals create a higher quality product.  I typically go for Brunch which is a great value, so let me make my point clear through a comparison of the Huevo's Rancheros of both locations.  When I order the Huevos at this location it comes out just as I'd imagine.  The tortilla is perfectly soft, the eggs cooked just how I ask for them, a delicious side of potatoes and the eggs smothered in amazing green chile sauce.  The difference with the Monroe location is simply that the line doesn't execute the dish as well, the tortilla is not as soft as it should be, the food is slightly colder than ideal and overall, the dish is simply not as satisfying. Let me just make my point that I think some people here are just a bit too attached to a supposed \"intimacy\" of Pasquals on Monroe.  Though this one does not have the same mom and pop feel it still serves up delicious food for a good price."}
{"text":"The nachos with carnialtas was exquisite. The streak burrito was quite tasty. The kitchen was a tad slow, so give yourself time. Get a margarita and relax, as those were also pretty good."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I loved the Pasqual's on Monroe Street. My fiance raved and raved about how awesome it was and when we finally went, I agreed. It was an uncomplicated but delicious and memorable meal. The atmosphere was cozy but not quaint and the servers were friendly, quick and attentive.  I don't even know how to express the epic disappointment I experienced at Pasqual's Hilldale location. I'll start with this: I'm not sure if I should throw it up now or suffer the consequences later.  Atmosphere: Holy dark and bright at the same time? You walk in and it's dark and cold. You sit down and depending on your orientation, you may be staring into a poorly lit section of the lame \"industrial\" decor or you may have the damn sun glaring into your eyes annihilating your retinas. There are no shades to combat the sun. The music is LOUD. Way too loud. I got tired of asking my dinner mates \"What? I can't hear you!\" a hundred times.  Service: We walked in and received a vacant stare from a 15-17 year old girl who was doodling on a napkin. No greeting. We asked her if our party had arrived. She called another male server over who couldn't seem to find our reservation. We then said that we needed a table for 8 and a highchair. They took a few minutes to push our tables together and lay out the menus and told us we could sit down. Once we got situated, another extremely young looking server came over with a tray of water. Before she even placed the water she said, \"Uh, just so you guys know, we don't split checks at all for like, parties 8 and over so I just want you to know to know that now instead of being surprised. Like, we don't split checks AT ALL.\" Her tone was really snotty and with no intro of \"Hi, my name is X welcome to X, I'll be your server today!\" it really set a bad tone for dinner. She placed the water and left.   We waited about 10 minute for our companions to arrive. No one came over to take our order for drinks or appetizers during that time. Once our companions did arrive it took another 7 for anyone to come over and take our order.    We ordered our drinks, two orders of chips & salsa, one order of guacomole and were told immediately that, \"Just so you know, you only get ONE refill per order of chips and NO refilled on the guacomole, ok?\" Yeah, got it.   The drinks arrived and soon after, the chips/salsa/guacomole. We all were really disappointed to see the chip baskets not filled to capacity and the guac/salsa served in paper solo cups. Considering that you get larger sizes of chips/salsa for FREE at the majority of other Mexican restaurants, it was pretty \"Eh.\" for the price.   A different woman came to take our food order. We were in the middle of assessing who had cash and who would use their card to pay for dinner, etc and she interrupted and said \"We can split the check 3 ways if you guys want, just tell me who is with who.\" She was extremely pleasant and helpful. The food arrived quickly ...  Food : Chips: Not warm. Each chip was a wildly different experience. Some chips greasy, some coated in salt, some bland and flavorless, some covered in some vaguely generic Mexican seasoning blend, some with all of the above. Point being: Uneven distribution of whatever they are putting on the chips. How do you mess up a chip? Salsa: Hot & Mild were boring. Guacomole: Pretty good but served in a solo sauce cup. Baffling. Meal: Veggie mix enchiladas with mole sauce, black beans and rice on the side. Rice: lumpy, ok seasonings. Black beans: no refried, really tasty and oddly the best tasting thing from that entire experience. The veggie mix enchiladas wrapped in soft yellow corn tortillas with mole sauce: Gross. Just gross. The corn tortillas tasted bland. Did I even taste them? I don't know! The veggies were half cooked and by half I mean some tasted squishy and some were crunchy. Nasty texture. THE MOLE SAUCE. WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE MOLE SAUCE? It's nasty. I love a good house poblano mole sauce, mostly even when it's nothing special its good. Not this. This mole tastes pompous, some kind poorly thought out fusion nightmare. Basically it just tastes like pure unsweetened cocoa sauce. Spattered all over on the enchiladas. For an extra 50 cents!  I'm a plate cleaner/leftover taker and I didnt even come close to finishing nor took any home.  My companions shared my sentiments. A taco salad with cold ground beef. More disgust with the mole. Lumpy rice! What's with the solo cups?  Topping it off, getting home my stomach felt awful and so did my fiance's. I will never go back and I will never recommend this place to anyone. Horrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Tuesday night.  Had a tasty burrito and half-priced original and traditional margaritas.  Sat at the bar and watched the Brewers game.  I would do it again."}
{"text":"Reading negative reviews, figured I'd add my good thoughts here. I've found the service and food at this Pasquals to be delightful! The full order of enchiladas never fails to satiate, and my margarita was excellent. I have seen the place closed at odd times of day, but I assume that's growing pains?"}
{"text":"This was a bit of a disappointment. Think diner or very casual. The carne asada was tough, stringy. The cheese lacked character. The chips average. The rice over done and too much chili powder. Tortillas were average. I prefer fresh made. The salsas were very good, however. My friend had the mild and I had the spicy. She was disappointed in that she ordered Fajitas and got a burrito. I had tacos. She was comparing with experiences in Miami. I was comparing with experiences in San Jose."}
{"text":"I would not call this authentic Mexican, by any measure. That said, it's a cute atmosphere for a mall restaurant and the tacos were edible, especially the shrimp taco. The service, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Our server offered us chips and salsa and failed to mention that they cost $3. The salsa is terrible. Tastes like it's from a can. The chips are ok. People in my group all said their food was ok. I got one fish taco and one shrimp taco and they were fine. It's a very weird menu that lacks a lot of things that most Mexican restaurants have. Our server came back twice while we were still eating, not to find out how everything was, but to basically urge us to hurry up and finish! She literally said, \"Are you going to want anything else? Are you almost done?\" I mean, who trains these people? Also, someone else delivered my food and didn't even know the difference between fish and shrimp. Clearly, our server was about to go off shift and all she cared about was getting rid of us. If you have to eat here, it's only ok. Otherwise, I am sure there are better, more welcoming Mexican restaurants around Madison. Or else, I hope there are!"}
{"text":"Pasqual's Cantina on East Wash is a complete mess. Despite the great food we've always had at other Pasqual's locations, the service at this new location is horrible. The bar is understaffed or poorly serviced so, despite finding an open space at the bar immediately, I watched the bartender walk past me for ten minutes telling me he'd be right with me. After finally getting a drink, we waited about 20 minutes beyond the estimated time (about an hour total) to get a table in the dining room, and we were only seated after we checked back in with the hostess. Once seated, we sat at the table for 10-15 minutes as a multitude of servers passed by us without out a word. Finally, our server Jasmine appeared and was apologetic about the wait, though I can't imagine how she could justify it. She returned a few minutes later with our order of chips and then disappeared again. We didn't see Jasmine for about 25 minutes, during which time our drinks were emptied, our food was delivered and mostly eaten and we stared at other servers as they passed by, knowing something was wrong but refusing to get involved. Well, to be completely honest, we did see Jasmine standing behind the host stand for several minutes chatting, but she never made it into close proximity to our table. Finally, Jasmine did return and, upon request, delivered a water to quench my thirst before leaving us for another fifteen minutes. Somewhere around the ten minute mark, after spotting the obviously frustrated look on Amy's face, a manager came over, cleared a plate and said she would ask our server to return to the table. When, mercifully, Jasmine delivered our bill I dropped cash into the folder and walked out. I probably should have stayed to talk to a manager, but the manager who came to our table didn't show any real concern and I was so annoyed at that point that I was done. While I love the potential of a Pasqual's within walking distance, this is not what I had in mind."}
{"text":"Maddeningly awful service at times - but GREAT margaritas and pretty yummy food.  Overall a fun place to go - but don't be surprised if your meal comes before you even get your drinks."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for margaritas and food. Soup, cornbread, enchiladas, and burrito were tasty and hit the spot. Nice melding of some different flavors that you don't get in an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant. Needed to pay extra for sour cream (what? This is Wisconsin, after all) and if you have one loud table, the noise echos throughout the restaurant, but we will be back."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for lunch. I had a gift card and had asked them to see how much was on the gift card. They said they would check and never did. We then ordered our lunch. I had the chicken wrap, and my friend had a burrito that was supposed to be in a blue tortilla. The chicken wrap was TERRIBLE. All it was stuffed with was lettuce. I told the bartender, who was also our waiter, and he actually agreed with me, and said yes there was lots of lettuce in them, but this is how they are supposed to be made. WHAT?????? He never did any apologizing or tried to make things right. My friend got her lunch, but  never was served her blue tortilla. I have been to this place 2 times in my life and both times was not good. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I am sitting at a dirty table that I had to ask to be cleaned.  We have never been here before and my table mate who doesn't like spicy queso asked to sample their chili cheese dip before ordering it, and the manager said that all the portions are in premeasured containers so there is no way to sample.  I can get samples at a *grocery store*.  If they are actually cooking their own food, how can there be no samples?  They seem much more conserned about portion control than their customers' enjoyment.  I will not be buying dessert (if my food and drinks ever arrive at my table) and I won't be returning on principle.  I wonder if they count the leaves of lettuce in my salad?  Also, we were not given utensils until we asked for them."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pasqual's since I moved to Madison in 2003. My wife and I decided on the theme of our wedding at Pasqual's in Hilldale. We have many good memories there.  ...but I'm pretty sure we're not coming back. We stopped by for brunch a few weeks ago and had was is arguably the most bland brunch food I have ever had. It was just plain and flavorless. It was almost like an entire ingredient was forgotten. But I was so invested in Pasqual's that I chalked it up to a freak occurrence. Perhaps a new cook or some new breakfast dishes. We went back to try dinner again at the Hilldale location.  I decided to try the chicken fajitas because I'd had a good fajita dish at another local restaurant. Their dish was sizzling, flavorful, and plentiful for the $11 I paid for it. I saw Pasqual's was more expensive, but I thought, \"Ah, it's Pasqual's, it's gonna be great!\" It was not. Then chicken was boring. Looked, felt, and tasted like it had been microwaved out of a frozen bag. The two lukewarm tortillas I got were similarly unimpressive. After I constructed my first fajita I had two strips of chicken for the second. I paid $13 for this?"}
{"text":"My kids and I had a great time. Our server was so friendly! She included my kids in fun conversation and treated them like adults, not kids.  Overall the food was good. My son loved the breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday and really terrible experience. We ordered margaritas and several tacos. First of all, their margaritas taste like $5 tequila mixed with walmart sweet and sour mix. When the tacos came out, they were cold and bland. The cheese on it was exactly what you would buy from the grocery store and it was literally thrown on there straight from the fridge. We told the waiter as a courtesy, not that I wanted any discount.  The manager came out, and she was the rudest, least classy person I've met in a management role. She said she took it out from the kitchen herself so it couldn't have been cold, then scolded us saying they don't melt the cheese, after which said \"we good, can I take this away?\" We didn't even know what to say at this point. After she left with our terrible food that we barely ate, the waiter told us they gave us a \"discount\" which was 10%.  I honestly would have preferred if the manager didn't come out and certainly would have preferred to get no discount rather than a stupid 10% for food we didn't eat at all. Honestly, worst Mexican food I've eaten, you will get better stuff at taco bell and certainly better service so avoid if possible, I know I will in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night and we are glad we did. The tequila selection is amazing, and they have other good cocktails too. Husband got a margarita and I got the bumble tea (earl grey infused vodka with lemon - yes please)  Drinks were great and the food was really good. Husband got the special (carnitas trios) and I got the Pasquals taco (crispy with shredded beef) and we both got a mix of pinto and black beans for a side.  Our waitress was wonderful, and we would definitely go back next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"This is a Great family place to visit for some good Tex-Mex. Their chips and salsa are excellent. They make a mean margarita and offer all kinds of different flavors including a special of the month. I love their quesadilla. My husband loves their burrito bowls, shrimp tacos and regular burritos. We always enjoy our visit and they have very nice service as well. In the summer time there's an outdoor deck overlooking water that's very nice too."}
{"text":"mediocre at best.  1. we were seated with my ten year old nephew next to a painting of a naked woman.  2. the waitress didn't bring all the drinks we asked for till the second time around (\"and water\" was a tough one)  3. when our food finally came out we still hadn't got any silverware so we got to stare at it for a bit.  4. when we finally got to dig in the cheese was already re-solidifying. kind of like a tv dinner..."}
{"text":"We used to love Pasqual's, I especially loved the quesadillas.Over time it seems like the portions get smaller and smaller (and less chicken in the chicken quesadilla) and the prices get higher and higher. Now its extra for sour cream (really???) and more than 1 tiny cup of salsa is extra. We were so shocked by our last bill we decided we could no longer afford it, esp. after nickel and diming you to death for things that really should be included. The food is pretty good but WAY overpriced. I esp. used to enjoy the lunch special, something like $6 for food and a drink. That was great but unfortunately long gone. The last time the waiter accidentally charged my credit card ten times the actual bill. When brought to his attention he had an attitude, acting annoyed at me! The manager finally straightened it out. This long time customer is no longer a customer."}
{"text":"Bummer that they charge for chips and salsa (and while it's in the menu but don't mention the charge when they ask if you want some as you're being seated).  Food was delicious. I had steak fajitas and man do they cram a lot on there considering the size of the plate it's served on. Very flavorful but tough to get at beans/rice when the meat and veggies are stacked on top. My boyfriend got a breakfast bowl and echoed that the flavor tasted good.   The bad? Service sucked. We asked for a minute more to look at the menu and it was 10. Water wasn't refilled until after we were done eating, despite glasses being empty when we were served.   At the end my boyfriend looked up at me and said \"I'm still hungry.\" Not something you should hear after a $40 meal (and I definitely felt the same way)."}
{"text":"Our visit was on a Saturday afternoon. We choose to sit outside even thought is was a bit cooler outside. We were seated quickly, table was adjusted for the two of us and our waiter (Chris) was out quite fast. He was knowledgeable with everything from beverages to entries and didn't let us down. Food arrived fairly quick. It was hot, plentiful, and good tasting. The waiter even left us his iphone to help us find an answer to a trivia question we were discussing. All in all we were treated well and enjoyed the dining."}
{"text":"I love Mexican, and I've had Pasqual's chips before (thank you Hy-Vee), so I was excited to actually check this place out.    First 'pro' was the interior. I loved the large wood beams going across the ceiling and the minimal decor.  We started with chips and guac.  GREAT guacamole. And of course, the chips were crisp and seasoned well. I ordered a single enchilada with a side of sour cream. The food came out in a reasonable time, but I did not have my sour cream.  I asked again for the side of sour cream, and the waitress came back with sour cream and guacamole.  I did not order or need more guac, so I set it aside. The food was good and I enjoyed all of it.  After eating, my friend and I waited. And waited. And waited. Nobody stopped by to check on us, clear the plates, and see if we wanted the check. It was after lunch rush hour, and was not very busy in the restaurant.  We waited probably around 10-15 minutes before anyone stopped by the table.  When we got the check, there was a side order of guac on the check.  I put money in the checkbook, but kept it close, so I could point out the small discrepancy. Again though, we had to wait.  Another 5-10 minutes before the waitress came to take the checkbook. She was fine with removing the guac from the bill, as I had not ordered or used it. The change came back quick.   Overall, the food was great, but the service was poor.  I'd like to go back and hopefully have a better service experience and try some of the tequila based drinks!"}
{"text":"I mostly go to the Monroe Street location due to living closer to it, however I enjoy the Hildale one much more. The food here is much more Tex Mex rather than authentic Mexican. The staff has always been friendly and I can always get seated within 5 minutes. My go to meal is the spicy fries and the half order of nachos. I suggest the half order of nachos if you are getting them as an appetizer or sharing them with another person due to the amount you receive."}
{"text":"We met a large group here. Based on the mediocre reviews I wasn't expecting much and played it safe by ordering a beer. Can't comment on their cocktails, but did have some chips with guac, and then ordered fajitas, another hopefully safe choice. Typically with fajitas you get your sizzling meat, peppers and onions served on a hot skillet, with the cool stuff like cheese and lettuce separate, right? Not here. Everything came out crowded on one very small plate and at the same temperature. Yuck.   On the positive side, they deserve credit for reviving the Fyfe's location which sat unused for a good long time. It's a cool old building with some nice features like tall ceilings and big windows overlooking East Wash. The bar area is pretty inviting, but the dining area less so. Our server was very good and cheerfully brought a large number of separate checks.  This place is near home and I'd like to see it do well, but based on this experience I wouldn't return for a meal. Maybe will try the bar sometime?"}
{"text":"The website says it is open until 9pm on Sunday nights. It is now 6:15 pm, just drove by and it is closed. Pretty sad, especially since the reviews are not that great. If I can't trust the website, should in trust the positive reviews?"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible and the food is just mediocre. I ordered a margarita and It was a little too sweet for me so I asked my waiter if I could get something else. My waiter made it seem like it wasn't going to be an issue so I ordered something else. Then..I got my bill and I was charged for two drinks so .... I was a little thrown off ? I simply thought it was a minor mistake. Things escalated very quickly, the waiters mood went from ' HAPPY' to treating me like I was a damn idiot. I was so confused? Then the manager came over to my table and she made me feel even more uncomfortable.  Over a little margarita? it was the most unbelievable experience I've possibly ever had at a restaurant.   All in all- if you're in the Hill Dale area, go to the Great Dane. You'll have a better time and better food."}
{"text":"I love their chips and salsa (I buy their chips at the store all the time now) and the fajita burrito. But the absolute best part is the lemon-basil margarita. So amazing. We go there regularly for the food and have had excellent food and service each time. We've been to the Monroe and the Verona locations as well and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Boring menu. I've come here quite a few times and have been disappointed each time. First of all, what Mexican restaurant thinks it's OK to charge for chips and salsa? Second of all, who puts 7 chips around a bowl full of salad and calls that a taco salad? Small portions, not much to choose from, slow service. But, the guacamole and lime margaritas are both really good. I'll give them that. I could continue with my review but you get the idea. Hopefully."}
{"text":"Torn between three and four stars for Pasqual's. Service was polite and prompt but not overly caring  The food is good quality but a little overpriced.  A big problem with this location is that they don't have enough parking and I wouldn't park on the street to eat here."}
{"text":"We took out of town friends there for lunch, thinking it would be a nice treat, since the other locations were good.   So not. Our waitress clearly didn't give a damn, and proceeded to prove it. More than 45 minutes after ordering basic items, we finally got our food. (and please note, she NEVER checked with us about anything during this whole time period.)  The food itself would probably have been decent had it not obviously sat under heat lights for a long period. Everyone's dish had a dried out crust on it. Being extremely hungry after the wait, we ate it anyway. It was obvious that had it been served earlier it would have been decent. Not great, but decent.  They really need to work on their service, if they want repeat business. As it stands now, we will never go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the fastest Mexican good in town, about as fast as Taco Bell, Pasqual's is the place for you. And if you think it depends on what you order and opt for chicken fajitas like I did (how can fajitas NOT be made to order, right?) your wait will be counted in seconds.  It took about 90 seconds to get guac and chips, and another 90 seconds (yes, 3 chips in) for the fajitas to arrive.  Yes, straight from Pasqual's microwave to your table, and for nearly $20 you get a $3 value of microwaved chicken slivers--so order now! The tortilla chips are actually pretty great, but as for the other stuff (and I never thought I'd ever say this), just stick to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"To start, our service was phenomenal. We are from out of town and he took us through the whole menu, gave recommendations on what to do around town, and always had our drinks filled.  The enchilada was very good with shredded chicken and Christmas style sauces. The Spanish rice was decent, not terrible. The smashed pinto beans however were insanely good.  I did not like the seasoning on the chips and didn't like that you only got one refill on chips even though we had 7 people in our party. Also didn't like that the salsa wasn't refillable at all-cost per bowl after the initial serving."}
{"text":"I have been to two other Pasqual's locations, the one in Verona and the one on East Wash, and this one is by far my new favorite.  My husband and I were meeting a group of friends here on a Saturday evening and arrived really early. We decided to get a larger table for everyone in the bar area and have a few drinks while we waited for everyone else to arrive. The hostesses were very helpful in finding us a good table.  We had Lisa as our server and I say this with 100% sincerity, she is probably the most interesting and fun person (let alone server) that I have ever met. Our group had so much fun with her, we ended up staying there for over 3 hours. I don't want to give anything away (there is seriously an element of surprise here) but the next time you come here try to get Lisa as your server. Not only was she fun, she also was VERY helpful with the drink and dinner menu. We all got to try so many new drinks, it was wonderful.  Aside from the amazing service, the food was delicious and the drinks were perfect! At some places you get a mixed drink and you can tell it was made with just a pre-made mix. That is NOT the case here. Their never-ending list of tequilas and many different varieties of margaritas will please even the snootiest cocktail connoisseur. Overall it was such a fun night, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, historic building. Nice atmosphere and friendly, attentive service. The few times we've ordered food I guess I'd consider it average quality. It is a nice place to stop in for a drink, particularly during Happy Hour. Decent selection of beers and they make a nice brandy Old-fashioned from scratch, not a mix."}
{"text":"Not that impressed.Typical Saturday night in Madison and knowing that this place would be busy. We called ahead to get on the list (because we couldn't get a reservation) on the way there. We were told 30-45 minutes. We show up, grab a drink at the bar and we receive a message roughly 5 minutes later that our table is ready. Awesome, lets suck down our drinks ASAP. It was apparent that the bartender was bush league. We ordered Pacifico on tap, however the beer came out extremely flat with no fizz. We told the bartender this and to show us that it was fine, he took the beer and poured it into another glass to prove to us that there was carbonation...seriously? You can't just take our word for it? We ordered spotted cow instead. Is is typical to be charged $2 for a mini glass of beer with a Bloody Mary? Just sayin. A 7 minutes later when our table is ready...oops..4 chairs for 5 people...looks like we need an extra chair and someone needs to sit in front of the cold Windows...lame. The food is decent. Considering the sides are basically three of the same items, there isn't really any variety with sides. Typical mid-west Tex Mex, and relatively same items as other location. One thing to mention, ask what actually comes with your food. My came covered in lettuce (which I hate) even though it was never mentioned on the menu. I asked for a side of the hottest salsa they had, the waitress said if you like real hot sauce, there is nothing that we have but she would bring me something. Never came. We asked for a second batch of chips, they came..roughly 12 minutes after our food. Water? One serving for us, with no fill ups. It's fun to try to eat a full meal at a place, pick through every black bean to try to not consume the lettuce that you never wanted, all at the same time rationing your own glass of water. Like I said, typical Tex-Mex from the mid west with horrible service all the way around. This place has been open long enough now that the kinks should be worked out but it's not."}
{"text":"We really like their burritos and typically get them to take out......because the restaurant is VERY noisy! And the rather odd parents that let their little ones carry on like animals!  Tonight I chose to go into the restaurant and order; what a mistake. The couple next to me left without food. The noise is nothing short of numbing. After 50 minutes no burritos, no update. You would think that they would put out chips. I think this is the last time........"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Way over priced small drinks. One that was undrinkable. Bad bland food. Orders the carnitas burrito and all I could taste was the beans in the burrito. I think the crunchy part was the carnitas. The rest of the people I dinned with had similar experiences. Skip this one"}
{"text":"Our meal was hilariously HORRIBLE. Our food took FOREVER to come out and it was cold. The bartender (we sat at the bar) offered to reheat the shrimp tacos...which sounded like a worse option than how bad the cold fish tacos tasted. We'd ordered the Garden, Shrimp, and Fish Tacos and all except the Garden tacos had 2 tacos on the plate. We asked why and were told \"Actually, that one comes with just 1 taco.\" And my friend who ordered it said, \"It didn't say that on the menu.\" And the bartender replied, \"Actually, it DID,\" and he took out the menu to SHOW us that the menu actually says \"Garden Taco\" (singular) versus \"Shrimp Tacos\" and \"Fish Tacos\" (plural). It was so absurd I laughed. And THEN he said, \"Hey, we charge you less for one.\" Are they trying to trick customers into getting only 1 tiny taco instead of 2? Then THREE servers/bartenders came over to ask why my husband wasn't eating the gross shrimp tacos. One asked if we had questions about the food. It was so strange and the food was gross and the service was terrible. Never going again, and telling my friends not to as well! Also, be careful exiting the restaurant, because there is no lighting and there's a step right below the door - we almost fell and broke our necks. And the bathroom is right next to the kitchen door - when I left the bathroom, I almost got decapitated by an overzealous server exiting the kitchen carrying a bunch of food."}
{"text":"We ate outside and had lunch.  Their burrito is ginormous....super yummy.  Plenty for leftovers!"}
{"text":"They probably should get 2.5 stars, mostly for George the bartender. Happy hour Margaritas were good. Half order of nachos with carnitas, what's with the seasoned salt on the chips? They were almost inedible due to the salt but the carnitas on the nachos was very good. Huevos rancheros, meh. Nothing stood out. Beef enchiladas, average. Pinto mash was equivalent to canned refried beans, bland. The rice, how long has that been around? Dark, tasteless, and almost as bad as Chang Jiang's.  New restaurants always need a bit of time to settle but my expectations were  higher since Pasquals has been around for years. The food should be refined by now. I could understand service glitches in a new location but had higher hopes for the food. Overall I'd recommend less salt, rice that's not cooked days ahead, and more authentic seasoning (cilantro, cumin, lime, epazote.) The only fresh item on 3 plates was sliced jalapeños on the nachos. I'll give them another try when they settle a bit. Nice decor but it gets noisy. A few too many little kids in the bar area."}
{"text":"A restaurant with an overall 2.5 star review is not my usual go to. I trust the basic judgement of my fellow helpers and as a rule I stick to 3+ stars. That being said people are grumpy, and yelping while \"hangry\" is a no-no in my book. This location is BEAUTIFUL. The bar is large and elegant! The building is historic and the way they updated it fits their uses but feels cozy and luxurious.  Our server was wonderful, she was very busy but attentive. Her timing was perfecta do she touched base with us thoughout our meal. We used our city tin coupon without a hitch.  Our bill was 27 dollars for two entrees, one margarita, chips and salsa after the coupon which is very reasonable.  They have a tequila menu that is 6 pages long!  Come on guys you can be a little more generous with your stars!  I'm looking forward to checking out their patio in the summer and taking advantage of their happy hour specials"}
{"text":"Love Pasqual's! We go here at least once a week. The margs are great but pricey and the food is always amazing. One of my favorite things is that we never wait for a seat, even when other restaurants tell us it's going to be an hour, we get seated right away at Pasqual's. The wait staff is great too - I am so sick of getting terrible service in Madison at other places, but the staff at Pasqual's is always prompt and attentive. The food is good, typical Tex-Mex, but it is always consistent and that's super important to me. I get cravings for this place whenever I'm in the Midvale vicinity! :)  My only complaint - I wish you were serving dinner until 10 p.m..... we went just after 9 one time and only the bar was open. I just wish we still had you as an option on those nights I have to stay at work late."}
{"text":"Decent Mexico-inspired dishes (I assume, as an Irish-American). Didn't seem authentic, more fusion, but I could be off-base there. I had the shrimp tacos, which were tasty if a bit too drippy from the slaw and with only one tortilla to combat it. They were happy to sub out rice/beans for chips/salsa and the bartender was solicitous. Sports on the TV but no one's perfect  Good place to stop for tacos."}
{"text":"Use caution when ordering the chips as an appetizer. The seasoning they use has a horrendous amount of salt, so much it was burning my lips.The homemade salsa had a lovely flavor, just left unable to eat d/t the awful chips.   The black bean soup was had great flavor and texture but again was so salty I couldn't eat but a few bites. The blue corn bread was a delight!"}
{"text":"No bueno. The burrito was not good. There was an abundance of cheese...nothing but green peppers, meat, cheese and lettuce in the fajita burrito. Literally. I could have easily made better. The chips and salsa wasn't good either. Some chips were drenched with salt... and others had nothing. Service was also slow and not attentive, which was surprising since our waitress was training someone. You would think they would go above and beyond since someone was watching them..."}
{"text":"The food is generally pretty good, sometimes it could do with a little more/better seasoning. My friends and I stop in occasionally for lunch and drinks. The burritos can sometimes get a little too soggy, but the tacos are absolutely delicious.   There have been times when we've stopped in for margaritas and our glasses were explosions of tequila with hints of lime -- definitely NOT complaining, those are the best nights that keep us ordering more.   Give me a basket of Pasqual chips (salsa/guac optional) and a glass of margarita and it's a darn good day!"}
{"text":"Pasqual's is one of my fave places but last night I had to endure a waiter in training who forgot my celebratory Margarita, brought my food almost simultaneous to my appetizer (which I specifically requested he avoid doing), asked me how I liked my food before I'd had a single bite (then didn't come back to ask me for reals), forgot to ask me if I wanted desert, and never brought the bill. And to make things worse we had to listen to a SCREAMING child for over 45 minutes. Not my best experience there but I do still generally enjoy the food and atmosphere most of the time and will definitely try again sometime once I've made a full recovery. ;)"}
{"text":"First yelp review ever. I've been to hundreds of Mexican restaurants - both good and bad. This may seem minor, but this is the first Mexican place that has ever charged for chips and salsa. Wth. Bartender was horrible. Was going to order food, but left after one drink. Should have known better after seeing other reviews..."}
{"text":"The place was very busy when our group arrived but they were able to seat us quickly. The service was quick at first but very quickly the waitress became very scarce. I ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt, I thought what I got was made with orange juice and very very bitter. The waitress didn't seem to understand that a margarita is made with lime juice even if they have other offerings they're calling margaritas without a descriptor like orange or strawberry. The carne asada tacos I ordered were very good when the waitress brought the correct order, I ordered with flour instead of corn tortillas. The sides black beans and Spanish rice were in edible. The rice overlooked to the point of being redried and the beans had no flavor whatsoever. To top it off it started raining outside while we were inside the restaurant, we still got wet from the leaks on their roof. I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Pasquals looks great after it reopened. The food there I don't think meets the awesome decor. You can go a block up and go to Cuco's and have better food.  The interior is great tho."}
{"text":"This is the best Tex-Mex place we've tried in town. Plates range around $6-9 per person. The tacos and tostadas will be piled high with fresh toppings like lettuce and pico de gallo and nestled next to extra-dirty rice and beans. The chile verde soup was really spicy with rib-sticking beans and the side of blue corn cornbread was more like a triangular muffin with a hint of sweet. If you order the taco dinner plate, try it with the blue corn tortilla shell.   I liked the variety of options such as the half-commuter - a burrito size small - and bar menu for people with smaller appetites. For example, the carne asada pequeños tacos (three small tacos), were succulently slow cooked,  piled high with fresh toppings and queso fresco - this was the best thing we ordered.   The location next to Hilldale is the perfect place to dine al fresco too, though the bar seats aren't bad when the restaurant and patio area get crowded on sunny evenings."}
{"text":"Tried to go here to have dinner. First the host seats us in the bar at a table with only 1 chair. Had to point out there is 2 of us and we need 2 more chair. After waiting 10 minutes, as the waitresses passed us several times no one stop to say hello, I'll be right you nothing. At that point we left.  Can't rate food but would have liked to try it. When we left the host don't don't even try to acknowledge us just gave us a funny look after my husband explained why we were leaving. Guess it's happened before."}
{"text":"Since the Hilldale area is not know for their breakfast in the immediate area, one Saturday morning recently, my Dad and I visited.  Now I had been here for lunch and dinner, and saw that it was pretty popular.  I enjoyed the outdoor seating, when you can get it, but unless you love the sound of small children screaming in an echo chamber (One lil' scamp kept throwing his hard, plastic toy on the concrete, as hard as he could one evening I was there.)  Anyway, I thought I would try it for breakfast, and I have to say, it was pretty good.  I had heuvos rancheros, which were nicely spiced, with black beans and potatoes on the side.  They also had a huge piece of blue corn bread that I ordered as extra with agave dipping sauce.  Not sweet like most Northern corn bread, but still 'cakey'.  Coffee wasn't the best tasting, but I've come to expect that from west side places.  Best of all, only adults were occupying the tables, and it was blissfully peaceful.  I'm just afraid they are going to discontinue b-fast at Pasquels, since there is so few patrons.  They also have a few bakery goods on sale, and a coffee nook with a tv."}
{"text":"Good service - the wait is well worth worth it! Enchiladas were great with the verde sauce and I love how they offer a half order of nachos instead of one size! Great for sharing still a good portion! Great outside seating to enjoy."}
{"text":"Let's start with what is right. The building is great. Old brick, cool decor. There's a large parking lot out back. Lots of outdoor seating behind the building in front of the parking lot. The bar is beautiful. Tons of seating in the bar room and the dining room. Great ambiance.   The tequila menu is impressive. There's five pages of tequilas. Lots of good sipping tequilas and they make some impressive margaritas. They were $8 each and very tasty.  What needs some work. It's not fine-dining, nor is it taqueria prices. I'm always skeptical when I have to pay for chips and salsa. They need to be really good. The chips were excellent. Crisp, not greasy, well seasoned.. The salsa was fine, but there was not enough for the chips. The entrees were all about $2 - $3 more than you would pay at most Mexican joints. Not a big deal, but enough to make you expect something special. I had the Pueblo Anasazi Burrito. It was fine, a little heavy on the cheese and beans. It came with a tiny ramekin of salsa -- only enough to put on a couple of bites of burrito. The rice was tasty, the pinto beans were toothy. My partner had the B.L.T.A. Quesadilla. He enjoyed it and was satisfied with the portion size.  Our server was prompt, not overly friendly, she got her job done.  There was nothing wrong with our experience, but it didn't wow me either. There are other Mexican joints in Madison I prefer."}
{"text":"Been here (and other locations) several times, and I'm not sure why I keep coming back.  Food is nominal, at best; service is marginal and drink prices are crazy. I used to love their chips, but it seems like now they are SO SALTY. Maybe it's my taste buds that have changed.  Do yourself a favor and support your locally owned, less commercialized restaurant."}
{"text":"The price I paid for my tacos was bit higher than expected but the guacamole and chips at the bar was cheaper than expected. So, I found it a bit of a wash on cost. I did like the managerial staff, she kept an eye on us at the bar when she noticed we had been passed by the bartender (very busy night).  We also had a great waitstaff. I will return and try them another day with perhaps a shareable dinner."}
{"text":"Pasqual's is not a bad place to go, but it just doesn't live up to the expectations of an upscale Mexican restaurant. The margaritas get high praise, but the selection of beer was too low. Food is good, but the menu selections are redundant/not enough variety. I do like the chipotle rice, it's a nice twist on the typical \"Spanish rice\". For the higher-than-average pricing, the food doesn't deliver (especially when you have to pay for chips and salsa!).   Atmosphere on the deck is nice, but it can tend to be noisy inside--difficult to carry on a conversation--so I would not recommend sitting indoors.   Staff was hit or miss. Front of the house experience was a little awkward but table service was fine.   Long story short, it's worth a try if you haven't been there and you want to see what else the SW Madison 'burbs have to offer."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the shredded chicken tacos for as long as I can remember, when I was within walking distance of the original Monroe street location, not 2500+ miles away in Phoenix, AZ where I still have yet to meet a shredded chicken taco that I like more! I also really love their salsa and guacamole with house chips. Maybe I'm partial, but I've been a fan for 30 years and counting! Every time I visit Wisconsin it's a must-stop for me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 6:20pm. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long for a table because I was starved!  I was surprised that chips and salsa were not served-you had to buy them (That's my favorite part about going out for Mexican.) Him and I ended up sharing a half order of nachos and the dinner plate of tacos. For as busy as it was, the food was decent, but not phenomenal. Our waitress seemed a bit aloof the entire time as well, which was not helpful in making the experience a great one. Overall, it's a good place to stop when you are shopping at Hilldale Mall and need a meal. I recommend that if you have the time and energy to go somewhere else for dinner, do that."}
{"text":"Margaritas:  Good, decent price during happy hour.  Food:  There is no hot salsa available.  Mexicanish food without heat is a blasphemy.  This aggression will not stand.  Skip the food, have a drink, go to a real taqueria."}
{"text":"Is zero stars an option? So I live close by here and I have tried this restaurant a few times and never had the best experience but after today I have given up all hope. I went to have lunch there with my friend and when we walked in the hostess was just looking around and so we waited in the doorway for a second and then I said \"hi there\", again she was doing nothing but looking around.. So I finally said \"hi, 2 please\" and she did not even respond, she just picked up menus and so we followed her to our table. Then we sat at our table for I'm not even joking atleast 10 mins. We saw 6 girl servers walking around the almost empty restaurant and none of them ever acknowledged us. I would have gone to ask the hostess if we had a server but she so clearly hated her job that I knew she would be no help. Finally the pack of 6 servers were standing together and I hear one of them go \"who has that table\" and all the girls just look at each other. One of them finally comes up to our table and says sorry she was caught up outside and she will be our server. We give her our drink order and ask to order our food now as well. (Obviously we were ready to order since we had just been starring at our menus for 15 minutes). The server did not seem happy about this. So we order an appetizer and our entrées and the girl walked away. After about 5 minutes a different server comes and drops off our drinks. And later a different server brings our appetizer while our server is following behind her with our entrées. While it was nice that our food came out quick, we would have obviously wanted a little time to enjoy the appetizer so our entrées wouldn't have to sit there and get cold. Our server never came back the entire time that we ate, both of our drinks were empty. The food there is spicy, so obviously you want a drink while you're eating. The server finally came back at the end when we were almost done with all of our food and asked if we were ready for the checks, never even offering to give us refills. Overall it was just a horrible experience. The staff there either just hate their jobs or don't care at all about having a sense of urgency... also maybe the servers should just have an inside or outside section, not both considering they can't seem to remember where all their tables are. Never again will we try this place. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Nice design and atmosphere.  Very mediocre service.  Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there.  As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else.  It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it.  It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion."}
{"text":"I guess I just don't get it.  It's advertised as a Madison favorite.  I hear people talking about going there all the time.  But the food just didn't leave me with a great impression.  The chips and salsa are great.  I suppose that's one thing that's pretty tough to get wrong.  But my burrito came out rather bland, as did my daughter's quesadilla.  Unless there was a kitchen mixup, my \"hot\" salsa sure did taste like mild.    The service was good, the bar selection is solid, and the atmosphere is a neat one.  The food, however, just doesn't do anything for me."}
{"text":"Great chips, but, way too salty. I'm drunk right now and they are way too salty."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with my experience at Pasqual's. The food and service is always good. They have great patio seating that overlooks a pond. It can get a little noisy inside.   I would recommend the Nachos or Fajitas with whatever meat you prefer because it's all tasty. They also have a few excellent Happy Hour specials including 1/2 priced nachos and $5 Margarita Lunas."}
{"text":"Traditional? No, many of their items are unique. For instance, I haven't ever seen a fundido appetizer that incorporates the standard melted cheese with chorizo AND refried beans- delightful! However, if you are expecting the standard dish that is heavy on the broiled cheese, this isn't it. Definitely worth trying, though.  My favorite dish to get here is the tacos banderos, which are chicken tacos that come with arugula, balsamic, strawberries, and chevre crema. TOTALLY unique and delicious! I did hear from the server, though, that these are getting taken off of the menu. I beg you, don't! Yes, they aren't nachos or fajitas or your standard American Mexican fare. These are, as I said, uniquely Pasqual's and need to stay."}
{"text":"First time at the hilldale location. Despite the majority of reviews being subpar, the restaurant was almost packed last Saturday evening. We were seated outside right away- they have a great outdoor dining area. Our server Aleesha was friendly and helpful. Seasoned chips and medium salsa (tasted rather hot) for 3$ have always been tasty to us. I ordered the a la Carte fish and shrimp tacos and requested their blue corn tortillas. While they tasted good, the ratio is off..Not enough of the seafood and too much sauce. I probably would not order again. Now I remember their tacos at another location were rather soggy too. Partner loved his fajita burrito though and had enough for a second meal. I would go back considering the location, atmosphere and service but I'm not in a hurry either."}
{"text":"Re-opened in October 2012 at same locale. Friendly staff, good food, great margaritas. Glad to have them back in Verona!"}
{"text":"Pasqual's has good offerings, all moderately priced. The fare is TexMex with a respectful nod to Southwestern, all with an added twist. I discovered this restaurant on my return home from the Dane County Farmers Market. Located only minutes away from the capital, the site of the restaurant is awesome, as it resides on a historical landmark, which is just plain cool. The sturdy dark wood tables and all the open/airiness, high ceilings, and subtle nuances make for a very comfortable visit.  The service is so-so. It could definitely be better but it's not terrible. This is my second visit and with both visits, there was simply never a warm welcome. Because there never seems to be a host upon arrival, once one does surface for a seating, there is this perturbed demeanor until we reach our table. THE FOOD: The food is a hit or miss. Sometimes the food is really good and other times it is middle of the road. There seems to be more consistency and better execution with the \"street fair\" portion of the menu (tacos, sides, etc.) Execution is a letdown in all other areas of the menu. It isn't that the food is horrible but it is simply one-note....basic...very, very ordinary. There is definitely potential but it seemingly has not yet been fine-tuned or best yet, realized. With Tex-Mex, a very forward and robust flavor profile is typically the protocol, however, Pasqual's struggles to awaken any flavor in even the most basic items: guacamole. I ordered the guac spicy in hope of having some trace of flavor but not only was it bland and absent of flavor, it severely lacked salt, which is a major no-no with guac. Guac without flavoring or salt is nothing more than green papier-mache. I recommend sticking to the Apps (Get Started With Section) and Street Food portion of the menu (1st page) for the best experience. And of course, pair these 1st page offerings with one of their many good drinks and all should be good....not GREAT but good."}
{"text":"The food is great - Pasquals easily does the best southwest fare in the Verona area.  It got better with the recent addition of lunch portions and the welcome return of their weekend brunch menu.  Unfortunately, their parking lot is an absolute combat zone.  They'd benefit from some additional parking and an exit to Cross Country Rd."}
{"text":"LOVE Pasqual's. My go to place for Mexican-American food in Madison. A little emphasis on the American.   I got their quesadilla and my girlfriend got the enchiladas. Our food was great but the only negative comment I have is that you can tell the food has been \"Americanized.\" The cheese tasted like that shredded Mexican cheese you get from the grocery store. No complaints, because any cheese is great, but at a Mexican restaurant I would expect a queso cheese like chihuahua or something similar.   Ending on a positive note: They have awesome margaritas and any of their starters are incredible. #guacfordays"}
{"text":"What Mexican Restaurant charges you for chips and salsa? That's just ridiculous. The food was ok, but after 2 beers and 2 margaritas, the bill was quite high and I felt like I'd have gotten more for my money had I gone for prime rib over enchiladas. There are definitely better Mexican Restaurants to visit on the West Side of Madison."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new Pasquals location however, it did not live up to my expectations.   The renovation of the old Fyfe's building was nice but they did in the main dining area, it was extremely loud.  So loud I couldn't hear the people at my table and the restaurant wasn't even full.   I had a basil lemon margarita which was good and we started with their chips and salsa which is always good.  My dinner, the burrito bowl was excellent, however there were a few glitches with the meals that the people I was with had ordered.   Our server really rushed us through out the whole night which was rather irritating.   This Pasquals location ha potential but they've got some work to do to catch up with other locations."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants! I love their shredded chicken in burritos or the quesadillas. Strong margaritas. Also great for brunch! The huevos rancheros here are delectable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pasquals is seems to know what there doing. The food is always flavorful and service is consistently great. The only thing I don't like about Pasqual's is the charge for chips and salsa. Come on, who charges for chips and salsa? This won't keep me away."}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is the enchiladas filled with cheese or grilled veggies and covered in mole sauce. The classic margarita is also very good."}
{"text":"Bad place for service. Their food may be good , but they have NO service. Sat in the bar area for over 10 minutes with NO ONE approaching me and I finally left. I would not go again too!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience! Staff was very pleasant and nice! Our waitress was very sweet. The food was sub par. The enchiladas were very dry and overstuffed with meat. Worst margarita I've EVER had...it was brown. Bartender tried to \"fix\" it and failed miserably. Service was slow and we had to ask for utensils. Midvale location is much, much better."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to stop here for some time.  We always hear people talking about this place and thier amazing food.  So we stopped to find out for ourselves.   We were immediately greeted by friendly staff, this was a clean place and a very big resturant.  We were told the specials and about thier drink menu.  We tried thier high end margeritas.  Delicious!  I also tried thier house tequilla on tap which was just ok....  They said it was 37 degrees which it was clearly not.  It came out warm barely even chilled.  So then we ordered thier Nachos for an appitizer.  These were very good and had some amazing seasoning sprinkle on the hot fresh chips.  Not a big app, but just enough.  I orderd the Chimichaunga special and my wife had the breakfast tacos whoch were reccomended by the server.   They were both wonderful.  Served with fresh black beans, rice, salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, gaucamole and lettace.   Fresh flavors and well plated dishes.  We both wanted something sweet afterwards.  However, they do not serve any desserts.  We will be back to try some more Tequilas and some more of thier food menu."}
{"text":"Blah. I did not have high hopes going into the meal, and I still was disappointed with my food. But let's start with what's good. Everyone at my table thought the black beans were tasty, and my mom loved her blue corn bread and jerk chicken taco. We also thought the carnitas weren't too bad, but it was more like dried out pulled pork. My dad thought his fajitas were pretty good. My husband thought his fajita burrito was decent but it could have used some more texture. Now for the bad. The rice was god awful. I swear it's from and box, and it was sooooo dry. No one ate the rice at our table. Why would someone make that rice, and think, \"yes, this is what I want to serve in my restaurant.\" Secondly, my \"garden vegetable\" enchilada was a joke and just terrible. The vegetables were olives (garden???) and diced raw bell peppers. There was nothing else in the enchilada; the veggies weren't even seasoned or cooked. I think they are garnish vegetables. Also, the verde sauce on both the enchilada and my husband's burrito disappeared. And my husband paid $1.50 to have that sauce on his burrito, and you wouldn't even have known it was there. Everything, except the rice, majorly lacked seasoning. This is Tex Mex! It should be flavorful! $4 for chips and salsa?!?!? What the what?! The salsa wasn't even that good, and they didn't even have any hot salsa option. We all liked the chips and the guac though.  The decor was nice, but the bar area where we sat was really loud. Finally, when I pay $8.50 for a margarita, I want it in a margarita glass. Not a pint glass! We will not be back."}
{"text":"Let me preface the review with the fact that my girlfriend and I eat out the majority of our meals. We are the type of people who never complain about our food or service, despite how awful it may be.  In fact, I actually had to download Yelp to write this review because the experience was so awful that it couldn't be ignored.   Went to Pasqual's with a group on cinco de mayo. We waited for over an hour and a half for a table, another 30 minutes after we sat down before a waitress greeted us. We started off with a drink order which took another 45 minutes to receive. They ran out of corona and made many mistakes on easy drink orders. Tried to compensate with chips and salsa deliveries (which they charged us for). When the food finally came out, there was a \"computer glitch\" which printed only half the tables orders. The food was underwhelming and Luke warm. To add to the chaos, all of the checks were confused but the entire table just accepted that the dinner was an ultimate fail and we just wanted to get out and continue our night, 2 hours behind schedule. The entire table agreed that it was by far the worst dining experience we can remember.   On a positive note, our server was nice, apologetic and accommodating. Will not return."}
{"text":"Finally this new location opened. It was crowded with the East Side people who have been waiting for a new watering hole with the Avenue Bar still closed for the remodeling. The bar is a big oval one with lots of room and good drinks just like the other locations. Our food was very good and served in a timely manner. I think things have improved since some of these other review were done. The building was not changed too much since it was the Cobblestone Station and other names in the last few years. It is still very noisy in the bar and restaurant and I do agree that some soundproofing would improve the experience. Great to have TexMex on the east side again."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican-American food that's more creative than most. There is a good variety of choices from healthy to unhealthy. My salad with pulled pork was delicious. Service was efficient, and the waiter made helpful suggestions. Only knock is that they charge for refills of the small plate of chips. Their chips are better than average, but that's being a bit taken with oneself!"}
{"text":"Last night a group of us came here for dinner. None of us were impressed with the food. I ordered the surf and turf nacho appetizer for my meal. It tasted ok. It seemed like too many chips and not enough shrimp or steak. The 3 shrimp tasted good but the steak was really dry. I ordered guac on the side which helped. I didn't order a drink and my total came to $18. Out of the 5 of us who dined there no one said they really enjoyed the food. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Such consistently bad service; gotta blame the bad management and lack of training.  Seriously-- how many times do you have to ask for silverware and water"}
{"text":"Been going to pasquals for over 15 years and have watched the quality go down further every year.  The menu has shrunk considerably.  They have 5 ingredients that are rearranged to give the appearance of choice.  They have decided that they're making money of the margaritas and screw the food.  Last night had a chili verde which used to be hearty stew.  I was given literally a green salsa with chicken and beans added.  No broth just pepper Juice it was inedible."}
{"text":"I had a fajita and how plain it was... There are certainly better places in Madison for Mexican food (though only a few that I've even enjoyed)... maybe I'm just too picky?  They also charge for chips and salsa, which is quite the deal breaker for me when your food is just plain."}
{"text":"Tried at least 4+ times in last year. Today is the last. Food cold. All the times but one I have gotten luke warm food. Today I tried the BLTA Quesadilla off their new menu. Way too much garlic. 2 pieces of bacon. It just sucked - all but the crispy tortilla. I went in at 11, opening time, with a day nice enough to eat outside but I didn't. Dining room chairs all haphazard. Not tidy or \"ready for day - lunch crowd\". Laziness to me. I can't go back. Must find another easy access quick lunch place in Hilldale. Cafe Hollander is much better than this. I would be shocked this location stays open given the parking and competition. Wanted to complain, but only 2 employees on out front. No comment cards."}
{"text":"I have always liked Pasqual's and in general they earn a solid rating.  The food was good - the service was as well.  But my main complaint is price.  They just seem a little pricey in general.  And I just can't stand paying for chips and salsa.  I think you can have one or the other - pricey entrees with free chips and salsa, or reasonably priced entrees with an up charge for chips.  Pasquals seems to be trying to have their cake and eat it too."}
{"text":"If you like El Dorado grill, you'll love Pasqual's. By comparison, the prices are good, the space is pleasant, and service is decent. The guacamole tastes good and doesn't break the bank. But El Dorado trumps Pasqual's in the realm of cocktails, which are WAY too sweet at Pasqual's. It also trumps Pasqual's in the realm of taste: Pasqual's is beyond bland.  If you don't go expecting anything close to authentic Mexican food, you will have a terrific time. But if you plan on ordering tacos, save some time and money and head to Naty's or check out where the El Grito truck is."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Pasqual's Cantina. I was excited to try it again and get something different. Unfortunately I was not impressed with the service or the food. I went around 2:00pm a little after lunch time and there were about 4 other families there. We were seated fast and were given water and the other drinks we ordered. It started off great. We then ordered our food and I got a cheese quesadilla with the new Mexican rice and the refried beans (mashed pinto beans as they called it).   The quesadilla was good, but it's pretty hard to mess up. the rice tasted like it was from a microwaveable bag but with a lot of extra seasoning. The beans tasted like they were from a can and were left out, because they had a crusty edge around them. They topped off the beans with a soiled piece of lettuce. I was pretty disappointed because I've heard and read great reviews. I wondered if it would have tasted better after their normal daily dinner rush.   After sitting for awhile we starred out the window waiting for our server to stop talking with her coworkers. We were also mesmerized by the employee sweeping close to customers feet and under their tables while they were eating. This was pretty funny to me and I shook my head in amazement.   Overall the meal wasn't great and I could have saved 20 dollars going to another restaurant. Hopefully others have better service and food."}
{"text":"Table of eight. Seven got meals. Eighth person was never served. Very disappointed. Food was okay, for those of us who got ours. Management was very responsive. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's sad that this Pasqual's even shares the same name as the one on Monroe st, because if this were my only Pasqual's experience, I'd never go back.    I used to love the old Atwood location, and the Monroe one is good too.  This newest addition just sucks.  First off, It's big and dark, yet like an old factory.  Huh?  The food selection is slightly different than the Pasqual's on Monroe street too.  Just weird stuff.  And what is with the bakery/coffee shop?  The table setup is strange too.  Every table is awkward, and the place is cold.  Just do yourself a favor, and don't go here."}
{"text":"Gross food. Really too bad because it's right next to our otherwise somewhat remote office. Service is slow and often unfriendly. Bar is fine for drinks. I hope it improves or goes out of business because the building has a cool vibe and the location is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time while I was waiting to look at an apt nearby. The decor was pretty chill. I was into it. The bartenders didn't seem to want to be there. I've been in the service industry for 10+ years 3 of those were bartending and sometimes you gotta fake it till ya make it and they just weren't. Not the worst thing though. I didn't wait long to be helped. Margarita was ok. Taste like it might have been from a mix and I was hoping for a real lime juice margarita.   Got a carnitas burrito... amazing. Was super delicious as were the rice and beans on the side. I'll be going back. Hopefully the bar staff is in better spirits. At least smile at me while you're in front of me. Then you can go in the back and say all the bad things you wanted to while you were helping me out."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so negative. The margaritas are fantastic and expertly made. If you're looking to get trashed on cheap frozens, head somewhere else. This is a place for unique, creative and fun margaritas on the rocks. The food is very good as well. The chef puts a fun creative spin on lots of traditional dishes. The only negative was the atmosphere; the restaurant filled up quickly after we arrived and was quite loud inside. Otherwise it's definitely a good place to go!"}
{"text":"The service was super slow. The restaurant was not even half full so we assumed that we would be able to get in and out of there pretty quickly. Our waiter was not attentive at all. After we had to ask for our check we waited for a long time, so we had to ask him for it a second time. Then it took him forever to bring my credit card back to me so that we could leave. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had...but close. Poorly executed tex mex. Even the rice and bean sides were sub par at best. However, excellent service and great drinks. We will return for beverages but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Pasqual's is definitely one of the places to go for a margarita. They taste great and they make them strong! Their food is excellent as well. I especially recommend the shrimp tacos and the steak burritos."}
{"text":"Awful!! Margaritas taste like syrup, food was bland, not served as requested, orders were wrong, service was absolutely terrible and inattentive. Took over 45 minutes to get a drink, couldn't even get a second round even though we were there 2 hours. Definitely never going back, and either are the other patrons I was with. There is a better Mexican place across University that is 100 times better, so don't waste your time on Pasqual's. It's sad, because it used to be good, but the last 3 times I've been there it's been the same crappy service, food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, but horrible service. We had a bigger group, and the few of us that arrived first waited almost 15 mins to get our first drinks, when it was NOT busy yet. One of the girls we were with had a plate of raw beef and when the manager came out, she never apologized for it, didn't comp the food or offer any discount. She acted as if it was our fault that we didn't like the food. The bills were done wrong, and we were told at one point, to just add the amount for food to the bill, and that is the total."}
{"text":"Pasquals is decent Tex mex. I have my favorite things I come for and I'm not disappointed. The margaritas are great because they have a ton of different ones plus you can build your own, that's what I do. Half price house margaritas on Monday and Tuesday My favorite menu items are enchilada one cheese one pork carnitas Christmas sauce, chicken or steak fajitas, shrimp tacos, quesadillas and the barbacoa shredded beef is pretty good. If you come for happy hour the 4$ half order of nachos is a ton of food and cheap. Pretty good nachos too. Tex mex not Mexican. The service is always good to me but I also always sit at the bar. During the warmer months they have an outside patio viewing a little pond and soccer fields. Not a bad place to stop if you're in Verona"}
{"text":"Not coming back.  It wasn't anything special.  Sampled a few peoples' dishes to make sure it wasn't just mine.  It wasn't.  Underseasoned and dry.  Nachos that we extremely boring.  I had the breakfast bowl which looked like they'd just thrown a bunch of leftovers together.  Veges were limp and flavorless, chorizo has no spice, and it generally looked like a brown sloppy  mess.  No one complained until we left and then we all compared opinions and were unanimously underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This place is pricier than other Mexican restaurants, but DAYUM, is it worlds better. You know that awful, dense rock of food that's left in your stomach after most Mexican restaurants that prevents you from doing much of anything afterward except sitting in front of Netflix and hating yourself until morning? Yeah. You don't get that when you eat here.  The food is more akin to food truck tacos--always amped up with some fun little twist. And with WAY more veggies and better sauces than most of the other guys.  I always feel guilty when I eat heavy enchiladas and greasy fajitas. But I don't feel gross when I leave Pasqual's--and I think that says something.  The margaritas are standouts: try the lemony basil one or the cucumber (chipotle? cayenne?). Both are just LOVELY.  Service is good. Don't let the hostess trick you into sitting across from the bathroom (it doesn't smell bad or anything, but even in an empty restaurant, I don't want to sit anywhere near a bathroom).  Park in the Metcalfe's parking lot on the far edge closest to Midvale Blvd.  *Don't forget to try the little food truck menu tacos. And the street corn (it's different than most street corn, but creamy and good)."}
{"text":"The food was incredibly bland. I would not eat here again, even though the service was perfectly fine. I should have known not to trust a Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa.  I had a taco salad (which isn't exactly a savory dish, I realize) but everything from the shredded chicken to the salsa was just BLAH. My fiancee had the shrimp tacos and had the same complaint: bland.  I won't go back to this location - but will probably try the Pasqual's on Monroe. If I'm near Hilldale and want Mexican food, I will stick with Laredo's just down the road."}
{"text":"A disappointing mediocrity. Mexican for the masses. Cardboard food with pablum sauces.  Just awful"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Our server messed up our orders. Came with a group of friends, one friend ordered 3 tacos, but instead had 2 which were filled with so much lettuce that it was like eating a salad. Another friend ordered chicken fajitas but the server came out with the wrong fajitas for her. Then I ordered a combo fajitas with just shrimp and steak, NO CHICKEN with CORN tortillas, I got fajitas with steak and chicken and flour tortillas. Then I told them I didn't order that, they corrected the fajitas but still got the tortillas wrong. Service was so slow. Even when it wasn't busy at all! I felt bad for the family sitting beside us waiting 20 mins to order. Saw our waiter just standing by the bar chatting away. Barely came to check on us also. Also, the when I ordered fajitas I thought I would get the traditional fajitas on a sizzling plate. Not a $18 mediocre wannabe chipotle burrito bowl. They skimped on the meat, nothing but rice and beans under it. Also meat was dry. There was flavor, but just dry. Would rather pay $8 for a chipotle burrito bowl. First time experience..& it was horrible. Only thing I enjoyed there was the margaritas. But even then, those were over priced I feel like. $8-$9 for a small glass. If you are looking for other Tex mex or even better, an authentic Mexican restaurant, Madison has a lot of better options out there."}
{"text":"Last Friday night we stopped by Pasqual's for a drink on our way to The Avenue Club for fish.  We sat at the bar and ordered a half order of nachos along with a \"few\" ($5 special) margaritas.  The drinks were strong- AKA delicious- and the nachos tasted great...you know....like nachos.  :D    Just a word here on scoring.  I believe everyone should start with 5 stars.  If something happens from there I can see a deduction, but if it's what I expected then that's that!!  I don't start them out with 3 stars and then expect the wait-people to do cartwheels in the aisle."}
{"text":"Poor service!  Took 45 min to an hour for food with no explanation.  Food was cold .  Server disappeared after bring drinks.  Apparently one meal had to be remade but was never told.  Feel as though all Pasquals are on the way out.  Not as good anymore  manager was unprofessional, host was unprofessionally. Did not even offer a full refund.  Training needs to occur with this staff on CS skills. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Good enough but didn't blow us away.   Pros: A great building and space. Also a huge parking lot in back. I know it's not en vogue to proclaim the praises of black top but how nice was it to eat at a restaurant close to downtown and not have to battle the rest of the city for a parking spot. They also had a lovely outdoor eating space though we chose to eat inside.   Cons: Food was good but nothing to write home about. My enchiladas were a bit greasy looking with all the cheese. The sides are the standard Mexican rice & beans. I don't care for rice and was disappointed they really didn't have any other options. The waiter offered sour cream which I accepted.  Hubby had the jerk chicken burrito which we can probably rate a bit higher. Beware, it is spicy but the cucumber yogurt offsets it. He asked for no tomatoes in it and of course it came with them. He picked around them instead of sending it back.   It's disappointing chip & salsa aren't complimentary but for $4 it was worth it for us and they were good.   Service was also slow at lunch today despite not being busy. This might be their business model -- providing a leisurely experience and today we didn't mind because we weren't in a hurry to get anywhere. We would think twice on a weeknight when time is more limited.   Will we be back? Unsure. Perhaps if we're entertaining out of towers because the building is so impressive."}
{"text":"My opinion on the chips and salsa controversy: I don't care that they cost money.  The chips are tasty, and it's not enough to invalidate the experience.  Free chips would not change this review for me.  Also, this isn't \"authentic\" Mexican food.  I'm not saying that in the snotty, \"I lived in X country for two months in college and I know the food\" way.  I'm saying it in the \"have reasonable expectations that you're going to get Tex-Mex\" way.  Now that that's out there...  What I liked: the food was better than average.  I had the Pasqual's Burrito with carnitas.  The cocktail I had was pretty amazing, although it's now not on the menu and may have been a special.  It was a Southern bourbon concoction that was a lot stronger than the rest of this review will be.  The beans I had, both types, were tasty, and the carnitas were on the good side of average.  What I didn't like: our food took a LONG time to come out, and the restaurant wasn't crowded.  Our waiter was unfriendly and just on the border of rude.  I don't want to judge someone on one day, but based on a lot of the stuff I see in these reviews, my experience with this isn't isolated.  Food-wise, things were a little bland.  I don't like super-spicy food, but this was uninteresting even to me.  Two star service, 3.5 star food, and I'll round it up to 3 stars overall.  Could have been better, could have been worse.  Another trip back would help me understand this place a little bit better."}
{"text":"never pay cash here. the sever and manager will chase you down in the parking lot like you are a thief.  rudest experience ever. no apologies or anythimg."}
{"text":"Ate at the new Pasqual's Hilldale last night.    Atmosphere:  While I'm a fan of the Pasqual's on Monroe St the interior of this new Pasqual's is bizarre.  It feels like an industrial space with lots of different colored walls and a cement floor.  It might work for some other type of restaurant but not a Tex-Mex joint.  Its way too bright also.    The Food:  Enh.  Not bad but not great.  Texas Tubbs is better for tacos.  The food had an almost Taco Bell taste/quality to it.  I had two tacos and we also tried the huevos rancheros.  The huevos were just plain gross and the tacos were ok.  One good thing is that its cheap.  The Service:  A friendly hostess sat us but she could not have been over 15 years old.  The service was fine for a $15 meal of tacos.  Not great but you get what you pay for.    Overall:  Unfortunately I don't think I'll return.  The space is too sterile and it feels like a chain.  Honestly Qdoba has more character and the food might even be better too..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after a long Saturday at work. Immediately I was taken aback  by the loud table of nine hundred children, because the open seating arrangement allows for no sound absorption. Not exactly how I wanted to relax. It was a bit cool that day, but we decided to sit outside where it was quiet. We started off with an order of chips with mild salsa and bean dip(and yes...you have to pay for the chips and salsa--not complimentary). These were okay, but nothing special. Not sure I'd order them again...For the meal I chose the Chicken chili. It was very good, laced with just enough green chile and beans. It also came with blue corn bread which was nice. Quite filling for a low price! The boyfriend ordered a tamale, which he seemed pleased but not fanatic about. They also have good iced tea, which I'm a big fan of. We both got a decent meal and left under $20 later. We'd go here again."}
{"text":"Nope, the food isn't amazing. It's not bad--but I haven't had anything that thrills me.   We still find ourselves here maybe once a month when we want something quick(it's easy to tell from the menu that a lot of it is pre made and just assembled to order), some chips and salsa(yeah, it's kind of a bummer that they charge--but I'm seeing that at a lot of places now), and my guy wants a beer.   This is where we dash into for quickie lunch breaks, mid-errand dinners, and casual guacamole dates on the deck.   I recommend the chile verde, it's cheap(maybe $7), tasty--and filling. I think they've tweaked the blue cornbread a bit, tonight  it was more moist and had just a dash of sweetness that I didn't remember from previous meals."}
{"text":"It's so strange to be giving Pasqual's only 2 stars, in part, because I've typically had perfectly fine experiences at the other Pasqual's locations. However their new Cantina on East Wash (oh how I love being in the old Fyfe's space again) was a major let down on a number of levels. Our server was lovely and attentive which I very much appreciated. But the margaritas were overly syrupy, the salsa was totally blasé, my quesadilla has very little flavor, the pinto bean mash was dried out & virtually flavorless AND a little tiny side of sour cream is now $1.  Really, you guys? What happened to the bright flavored, perfectly garlicky salsa and the good food that, while it wasn't the best Mexican food this California girl has ever had, it was at least enjoyable, flavorful and consistent?!? I'm bummed and it's too bad because I live nearby, but just to be clear, I've given this location 3 tries and after last night's experience, and with all the wonderful options in our great city, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I used to find this place decent, not great or authentic certainly, but good enough. Then I had the most horrible fish taco that was just the grossest thing. Bad taste and disgusting texture. I can't bring myself to go back there because I'm scared of that \"fish\". The waiter was nice enough about it but how could that \"thing\" ever be served in the first place. He should've looked around, then whispered, \"don't do it, don't order the fish taco\"."}
{"text":"The description of A-OK fits Pasqual's very well.  The margaritas and chips and salsa (yes, they do charge) are by far the best part of the menu. I recommend the extra hot salsa, which isn't sold in grocery stores.Chips are fresh and have extra seasoning besides salt. The guacamole as good as well.  As for the menu, everything is a wee blank.  THe most flavorful item on the menu is the mole sauce.  The mole sauce doesn't really taste like mole, though, but it's richly flavored.  I prefer the enchiladas over the tacos, as the enchilada sauce adds more flavor to the proteins which are not as flavorful as the taqueria joints in town.  Plenty of options for vegans and vegetarians.  The restaurant features both indoor and outdoor seating, and a bar (bar offers the full menu).  Pasqual's is satisfying, but not the best option for flavorful Tex Mex."}
{"text":"Our meal was fine. I wouldn't recommend the chips and salsa, the chips were pretty stale. The service and atmosphere were okay. Nothing much to complain about but also nothing to be excited about."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled being from California, but this wasn't great (Tex) Mexican food. The service was fast and nice, but my chips were stale and the black bean burger was quite bland and underwhelming. I also loathe any sit-down restaurant that charges for chips and salsa...it's seriously absurd.   In summary--bland and way overpriced."}
{"text":"I'll second what Veeder V. said. What a waste of that space. The food and environment on Monroe are so much better. Blindly ignoring the decor (hard to do) and the food tasted like the cook hadn't slept in a few days since he had been fired from his last gig at Sizzlers."}
{"text":"I used to love Pasqual's down on Monroe street in Madison..... this ain't it.   Food is 1-2 stars drinks are about the same.  It's a shame as the old location had really built up a reputation.  Groups seem to like to meet up here, but I would recommend Grays if you need to get a group together in Verona."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and was pleasantly surprised. As a disclaimer, the food is the very definition of tex-mex, so do not expect anything else! Again, as many people have mentioned, chips and salsa/guac cost extra. We ordered a couple of baskets for the group and I was impressed with the guacamole (though pricey I would say). Entrees are from $8-14 I would say (they can get up there). I ordered the single steak fajitas order ($13) and a margarita (around $7.50?). The margarita was delicious and very well made. The portion size for fajitas was very good: definitely do not need a double and the components were tasty (again, I really enjoyed the guacamole)! The waiters for our table were excellent and easily split the bill for all of us, including the chips and guacamole without an automatic gratuity charged in. Even though I had a good experience, after tax and tip, paying almost $30 for the meal just wasn't justified. It's overall pricey for what it is, but I nevertheless had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Burrito bowl was awesome!  Margaritas were standard.  I recommend the carnitas.  The margaritas were a bit overpriced for what you get.  Good location.  The street food was good too!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant, I always get their staple dishes. We tend to go for brunch and I love getting the pinto bean mash with spuds and putting mild salsa on the pintos. I enjoy the casadillas and the tacos. They do have great blue corn pancakes and great coffee. For later, they do have an awesome selection of tequilla and some of the best margharittas in town."}
{"text":"I love their salads. I just had the fajita salad with the smoky ranch Oaxaca shrimp. The spice and seasoning was just right. I've also had the taco salad with the pork carnitas; muy delicioso!  I've always had really good food here, but I've only eaten here on Saturday or Sunday for lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house, so I was excited to walk there in the summer for margaritas. Well...Their margaritas are decent, but grossly overpriced. No big deal, we'll go on Mondays because margaritas are half priced. Too bad the service is atrocious!!!! I don't care how good the chips are, or how convenient it would be to walk next door for Monday night margs... Because it takes FOREVER to get anything you order.. Including water! It's even worse if you sit on the patio. We gave it 3 tries, no more. During our last visit, we sat on the patio and waited patiently for 15 minutes for our margaritas to arrive. After those 15 minutes, two women sat at the table next to us, ordered margaritas and got them WAY before we did. It was the same server, so maybe she got confused.. But it never dawned on her how long we had been waiting compared to the other patrons...No apologies or any sigh of hustle whatsoever. Boo!"}
{"text":"Yet another Pasquals restaurant. How nice. At least, it would be, if the food wasn't completely forgettable. Honestly, shocking. As the owner \"Benny\" gets closer to realizing his goals of market-saturation, his restaurants seem to get less and less pleasant to dine in. At my first, only, and last visit to this location, it was so loud I couldn't hear myself think, the bathrooms might as well.have not existed,and the food was just.... Dismal. Charging for chips is a crime, listen to your patrons Mr. Ben. Beans were cold, yet crusty, what gives??? Here's a tip to the proprietor- Don't open new restaurants until you fix the problems with the brand. Seems a bit.... Desperate. But, hey, at least it's not a Food Fight. I'm hoping Pasquals will emerge new and improved, but based on how they seem to be content with a mediocre menu execution, who knows when that will be....."}
{"text":"Took some holiday visitor's there last night for dinner and we were not impressed. If you are going to charge for chips/salsa, then those chips and salsa better be darn good...which they were not. We ordered the chips/\"homemade\" guacamole and chips. The chips were cold, salsa was marginal and the guacamole was a green tasteless paste. If you need to pay for chips/salsa at a mexican restaurant then the chips should be freshly made, hot and good, and free refills. When asking for more salsa (they gave us 1 little bowl for 6 people) the waiter said he had to charge us, but he'd throw it in for \"free\" but we couldn't tell the owner, or they'd get mad. Really? The margarita was watered down lemonade, and the white sangria was basically orange juice with a bit of wine. The food was marginal and service ok. We should have been offered waters for the table and small plates for our chips/salsa/guacamole since we were sharing for 6. There are other better places to go for mexican food in this town, and we won't be back. Guests were not impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my brother and wife. I had the Anasazi Chorizo burrito dinner. It was excellent as were the black beans and rice served as sides. The chips and salsa are excellent as well. I haven't had any of the Tequilas there but there's an entire menu for them if you're so inclined. I've been twice and would go again."}
{"text":"Way too salty, uninspired tex-mex  The salads are a saving grace"}
{"text":"We entered as a party of 5 and the hostess did not greet us nor ask anything else as she displayed a clueless stare.  As I got her attention I advised that we would need a table for 5 outside. It was a glorious afternoon in Madison.  We were seated on the patio and found a dirty wood slat table that they cleared while we waited. As we were invited to be seated, the entire party noted old  food smeared on the floor  beneath  the table from the previous party.   Servers were pleasant but not very attentive to much but bring out the food and quickly collecting their tips from the 3 other dirty tables they were clearing while we awaited service. BTW, our order arrived hot and pleasing. Tasted okay. I asked for some ketchup and then waited quite a while..... .then a while longer...... ...and then completed eating half the burger before the server returned and then scampered off to \"find\" some ketchup.  I'm a big fan of refills on the soda and  server wasn't to keen on my empty glass or others at the table that needed more iced tea.  We were visiting the UWM campus and will return next month, but won't be back to Pasqual's at Hilldale Mall."}
{"text":"I love it's location and free parking. This place is well-known for their happy hour (try some of their margaritas, their are great) and it's atmosphere is quite cute. I like that this a go place after work and the newly renovated Hilldale mall add to it's attraction. I always try to get different things but I am in love with their chips and salsa that they bring to you the minute you sit down. I also have to admit that I tend to have their chicken quesadillas with brown rice and salsa, it is a huge portion and I always can bring some home. I also very much like their take out option, a nice way of by-passing the line of people waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Great food and delicious margaritas, but drinks are expensive! Food was reasonably priced, but margaritas at $9 each and $35 for a pitcher. They're good, not that good though. Service was fantastic and I'll go back for sure, maybe just head somewhere else for drinks afterwards."}
{"text":"I went to Pasqual's on Cinco de Mayo, and any Mexican/Tex-Mex/margarita-serving establishment is going to be swamped and likely not on their best game on said day. So do take my experience with a grain (or rim) of salt.   On food and drink alone I was pleased. I got the half-order of chicken nachos and the Dark & Dusty margarita. Like their Hilldale location, the half order of nachos is more than enough for one person and I was able to share with my friend and still have a few bites leftover.   The Dark & Dusty is one of the best margaritas I've ever had. Comprising Grand Marnier, citrus, smoked brown sugar, and anejo tequila, it is one of the smoothest and well-rounded margaritas I've come across.   Service is where Pasqual's was lacking. As mentioned, I get it was a crazy day for them, but it should be something that could have been planned for. Observations:  - When we arrived, the hostess couldn't tell us if we we should put our name on the list or head to the bar - we were flexible but they just stared at us and then a server came over and was literally huffing and eye-rolling while we decided.  - We ended up at the bar and the bartender put my friend's drinks on my tab. Not the end of the world, and when we inquired he said he would split it out later. On the next round, her drinks were also added to my tab. At the end of the night I ended up with everything.  - In addition to my friend's drinks, I was charged for someone else's shot. I didn't notice until after I signed; the bartender I asked about the charge was very kind and said it was a mistake and I could just take it out of my tip. I wasn't going to do that and penalize them for $2, so I just let it go. When I've been mis-charged at other establishments they have always just re-run the card. Taking if out of the tip just made me feel like an awful person.  - Food took forever and I was initially served my neighbors' order (we got the same thing, as it turned out). For a plate of nachos it took 30-45 minutes.    So, long story long, I would come back. If service is equally wonky on a future, non-holiday visit I'd probably skip it thereafter."}
{"text":"Pasquals newest location is predictable. It's the Pasquals formula - if you like the Hilldale location, you will be happy with the E. Washington location. It's classic American TexMex, not Mexican not Texas BBQ.   It seems like they are still working out some service kinks. You have to see the hostess to sit in the bar...'but when you do, the bar tender is also your waiter?  The waiter/bartender wasn't familiar with the menu.   I had the huevos rancheros and they were protectively serviceable. Dining companion ordered a chicken quesadilla, it was stuffed with shredded chicken and looked good.   I'm not thrilled that much of the menu requires extra up-charging. The waiter will ask if you want chips and salsa... You'll get charged for that. You want sour cream... You'll get charged for that.   Pasquals is. Welcome establishment to the near E. Wash corridor. Nothing special but decent and welcomed."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed, fajitas burritos is really bad, I don't know how they did it but it was the worst burrito I ever tried. Service by itself is good."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but service is terrible. Managers aren't even helping staff when it is obvious they are inefficient.  We sat after finishing eating for about 20 minutes with all of our dirty plates and empty glasses trying to catch our server's eye so that we could get our check. The manager even stood at the bar watching the entire time. Horrible service. We have been coming here for years, not sure we will be back again"}
{"text":"Beautiful building, convenient parking, good service.  The food was good, but not wonderful. The queso cheese is cold, and that was an unpleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Was there from 7-8:30 on a Tuesday night at a table and the service was bad. I barely saw the waitress, which was surprising since I was with a larger group. When I gave her cash for the bill she said she'd bring my change. She returned everyone else's cards, but not my change and ran away before I could say anything. She disappeared for the rest of the time I was there so I guess she gave herself a 50% tip. You're welcome?"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food at really reasonable prices. In my opinion the food is pretty mediocre when it comes to Mexican in Madison, better than (but more expensive than) Francisco's on the square but worse than(and cheaper than) Abuelo's in Middleton. I had the white chicken chile with quesadilla gill cheese (gluten free!), it was ok but I probably could have made the same if not better at home. The location at Hilldale mall is nice but if you are looking for great Mexican food in Madison look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great breakfast bowl!! Quality fresh ingredients. Bloody Mary's are interesting. Coming back for supper! Good ambiance open and clean. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The most awesome part of Pasqual's is their salsa -- mild, medium, hot, love it all. I think at one point in history they even called themselves a \"salsaria.\" The salsa makes me want to salsa dance even though I know I can't dance and I'm not even sure what salsa dancing is. That is how good it is, which is precisely why I'm so disappointed in Pasqual's today. With a large plate of nachos, they serve about a tablespoon of salsa in a tiny little cup. This happened last time, too, so we ordered extra salsa, but we got the same tiny little tablespoon cup. The chicken, the beef, the nachos, the tacos here are 3-star stuff, but I truly believe it's the salsa that makes it so. Gimme more!"}
{"text":"Pasquals is New Mexican! As in the state. New Mexican food is distinct, known for it's chile sauces. I was excited to try it. Those sauces are good at Pasqual's.  This place kind of down plays their New Mexican sauces, only offering it on a few menu items. I guess they're not popular? Maybe Madisonians are afraid it will be too spicy? I don't know.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with green chile once. I didn't see the chile on there. I thought they got the order wrong. The waitress had to point it out on the burrito. Mercifully, she brought me more without having to ask.  They once left the curtain to the kitchen open and I got a peek at their bank of like 6 microwaves. I can't get that out of my head. I understand that you make stuff ahead of time and customers demand piping hot food, but damn, that is a lot of microwaving.  What I really recommend this place for is a pancake breakfast on weekends. Yeah, they're blue corn pancakes, but they're light, fluffy, and huge. They are as good as those at the nearby Pancake House. You can either wait for a table at the Pancake House or get your food right away at the totally dead Pasqual's. It's a hidden gem for breakfast.  Don't let them be skimpy on that chile sauce!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and the chicken fajita tacos I ordered were very good! The only downside to them was that the shell was so flimsy and the filling so substantial that they were nearly impossible to hold and eat. I also enjoyed the side of pinto bean mash - it had a slight kick to it. The rice was just okay."}
{"text":"My opinion of Pasqual's has always been it's not going to be the best Mexican/Tex Mex food I've ever had, but it's also not going to be the worst.  This was my first time at this location and I really enjoyed the bar area.  The decor and flow are comfortable.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  Our food was filling, nicely prepared and plentiful.  Nothing was overly flavorful and that's the one thing I've always wished they'd change. I do love their rice though; that has nice flavor.  I think they also have some decent happy hour specials during the week.  And their parking lot is gigantic, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, and they served me meat instead of a portabella taco that I had ordered.  I took a bite, and then realized immediately it was meat.  The bartender called the manager over, and the first thing he did was say (in front of me), \"She already ate it?!\", as if I was trying to scam them out of a taco.  I then showed him that I only took a bite, at which point he apologized and they put in another order.  Then, when my meal came out, the taco came on corn tortillas after I had ordered flour.  The bartender argued with me that they were flour, and again the manager was called over, and he confirmed they were corn, and took my plate and put in another order for flour.  The entire experience was just chaotic and unorganized."}
{"text":"My experience with the food at this location wasn't the best. The service was very friendly, prompt, and attentive but it's a shame the food itself was just mediocre. We came here on a Friday night around dinnertime and it was very empty. We ordered the guacamole appetizer, the tamales entree, the chicken fajita burrito, and a margarita. The margarita was pretty good and the burrito was acceptable but the tamales looked and tasted like they were simply microwaved. The guacamole was also average but very small."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!  I had the veggie enchiladas, and they were second to none!  Pasqual's also has a back patio that overlooks a small water area, which is a very nice place to sit.  They also have some great happy hour specials, like $2 Coronas.  My only complaint is that the menu is somewhat limited.  For example, they do not offer chile rellenos, which I happen to love.  Overall, though, I would highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great but that's all they've got going for them. The food was cold and the beans and rice seemed to be reheated or as if they'd been sitting under a heat lamp. My dish had great flavor but I wish it had been prepared more professionally. My mom had to have hers remade. It was nice that the manager addressed the issue but the dish was worse the second time around. I don't think I'd ever go back here. I'll just stick to trusty Eldorado."}
{"text":"Wow. Went there last night with a big group of girlfriends from work. Before the waitress took our drink order she made a long appealing sell speech about this new tequila they have that they make themselves and that it's really great and we should all try it. So I said \"sure I'll have that! Thanks.\" The drinks arrive and mine is a tiny margarita (all the others were in a tall glass double the size)...but I didn't think too much of that. It tasted okay...not nearly as good as my friend's who got a regular one. So then we eat our food (mediocre) and then we get our checks. Turns out my tiny little marg was $14.50!!!! The other ones with the \"regular\" tequila that were double the size were $7.50. I was sticker shocked...$14.50 is a price I'd pay for a fancy drink at the top of the John Hancock building...not at a suburban Mexican food chain. I asked the waitress if it was a mistake, she said no, and I said \"I really wish you would have mentioned that when you were selling us on this!\" In response I got: \"we assume that anyone who cares enough would have asked the price.\"...I and all my friends were shocked by the response. Needless to say, there is zero reason I would go back there.   P.s. I've also never been to a Mexican chain that charged for chips and salsa. Much less $4!   P.P.S. I'm not a cheapskate...it's the principle of it all!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews here.  The local restaurant chain has been a Madison institution for around 30 years and most of the key menu items' recipes (burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas) have changed very little.  Some newer items have been added including a great tequila selection.  This is freshly prepared Tex-Mex with a \"southwestern\" (New Mexico) flare, large portions, generally with alot of cheese.  Good flavor.  Excellent and very distinct fresh salsa.  Nobody is splitting atoms in the kitchen with the cuisine.  It is not authentic Mexican food but what I think is a better version of the Tex Mex in Austin or San Antonio.  Like all Tex Mex it is comfort food and everyone has their own favorite.  The service was a but cursory and the waitress seemed to be stretched thin, but all the food came out promptly.  The margarita was also a little syrupy.  The current 2.5 star rating is inappropriate."}
{"text":"Eh. I almost want to give this a 1 star. The only thing preventing the downgrade is the fact that it was warm out, and I wanted a cold margarita. And they delivered. And it was half price.   If I had to pay full price for that margarita and for my \"fajita wrap\" that was mainly lettuce and bland chedder cheese I'd have gone with the 1-star for sure. I went here with a group of women. If it wasn't a work event, I wouldn't have even gone. I heard miserable things about this place and I should have listened.   Save your money. Go to a local independent mexican restaurant. Skip this adventure for better, more flavorful and adventurous dishes. If I wanted crappy mexican/southwest food, I'd have gone to Chili's."}
{"text":"I love Pasquals. The green and red chile is the closest I can get to real New Mexican cuisine around here. I don't know of any other restaurants around here that offer blue corn tortillas for enchiladas. Pasquals does and I love them! I think the food might be a tad bit overpriced for the portion size  (also the chips &salsa are not complimentary) but this won't stop me from going. The margaritas are strong! This is a great place to eat or drink."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for drinks. We sat in the bar, because usually you get better service there. This was not the case. First of all, they were understaffed. The manager was making drinks and trying to direct the floor from behind the bar. At one point, the host guy asked her a question from the host stand. She corrects him on the spot, directing him to come around the bar to talk to her. This, I totally get...but there were 2 other tables besides myself who heard her sharply correct him. I didn't feel welcomed, and frankly was nervous she would yell at me. It took a hot minute to get something to drink, but (surprise surprise) she was very pleasant when speaking with me.   The house margaritas come from a tap, but they were strong and good (a little on the sweet side, but I enjoyed it). We shared the black bean Nachos and those were delicious. I would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks and snacks to check the newest Pasqual's out before heading to a movie. My miracle margarita was good, though the rim of the glass was devoid of any usual margarita like substances (salt or sugar). So it was a bit basic, and not very cold. We also got an appetizer which was three small tortilla chips, a smear of extremely salty and spicy bean dip, each topped by one small ice cold shrimp. At $4.95, it was lacking in quality and quantity and was nowhere near being something I would ever order again. The chips and salsa and guac were fine. Two bartenders were working, one somewhat surly ponytailed guy and one more pleasant younger guy. I wish we'd had the younger guy as our main bartender because the other guy's 'tude was just a bit off-putting. The interior is nice, but kind of bland, not a lot of variation in seating, just long rows of tables. The blown glass light fixtures are very attractive, though. This place gets a solid third place with me in near east side area Tex-Mex places; Eldorado and Tex Tubb's still win."}
{"text":"Really tasty Mexican food. Portion size has gone tiny. I ordered the tamale meal, and I have never seen this small of a tamale. It was delicious, but the only way I can describe it is if you order a burrito and get an enchilada. Also, I came here for my 50th birthday, and no offer of a desert or drink or nothing. Felt like I was begging for more food when I complained. The server was nice, but just made my experience...underwhelming."}
{"text":"It was a great day to hang out on the patio with a margarita and a plate of nachos! Overlooking the retention pond is a nice touch. I ordered the 1/2 order of chicken nachos (happy hour special for $4 from 4-6pm M-F) and a traditional lime margarita (1/2 off all day on Mondays and Tuesdays). The margarita comes in a pint glass and is very tasty! The nachos come with your choice of meat or beans. The nachos are layered with all the standard toppings. I suggest getting them with the delicious jalapeno slices and sour cream! You also get the choice of 4 kinds of salsa on the side. This 1/2 order of nachos is a meal for one. The restaurant has a nice sized bar and lots of seating inside. I saw a mix of large and small tables. The restroom was clean and tidy too."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fun atmosphere and delicious food. The margarita recipes were unique and tasty. I was disappointed the chips n' salsa were not included, like a typical Mexican Restaurant, but I'd be happy to go again soon. Since it was snowing the day I went, the patio was closed, so I look forward to sitting outside this summer. Lastly, plan on spending a little more than your average Mexican restaurant...hence my 4/5."}
{"text":"Ate food from Pasqual's at a work gathering, catered, it was pretty standard. Nothing screamed out come back to eat me, so I have yet to go to the restaurant. Perhaps when I'm back in Madison for business I'll get the chance to try them again and see if their food (when not catered) will have more wow factor."}
{"text":"The environment at the Hilldale location is very suburban BigCity -- but I think Hilldale is trying to be the typical suburban BigCity mall these days.  The food seemed to be the same to me. It was quite tasty, but basically the same as Monroe Street.  [[minus the kitchy flowers marking the tables after you order and plus actual servers.]]  If I had a choice, I'd go to the Monroe St location, but this one would definitely do."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed with the food. What still amazes me that lacks in this place is the ability to keep tables clean from stickiness and the lack of quick response of person to table to waiter.  Two tables sat after us and were served by their waiter/waitress prior to ours even greeting  us.  If it weren't for the food we would find it hard to come back to this place.    I would hope this type of service wouldn't follow to the new high end tequila place that is supposed to open in the madison area."}
{"text":"Pasqual's is close to work, so we pop over for lunch from time to time. I have mixed feelings about this place. It is definitely Tex-Mex and not authentic Mexican, so many of the flavors aren't quite what I'm looking for.   Despite this, the location is convenient, portions are large, the food isn't overly salty, and service has always been great (biggest plus). They have a lot of space inside, with a separate bar area, and an outdoor patio. Mid-workday sunshine is really nice.   I generally get a single order of their enchiladas (plenty for lunch, a full order makes for leftovers), which you can customize as follows:  Tortilla: *flour, yellow, corn, or blue corn;  Filling: shredded beef, *slow cooked chicken, pork carnitas, chorizo, garden veggies, black beans, pinto bean mash, or cheese;  Sauce: red chile, *green chile, or mole Side: Beans (your choice) and \"new\" Mexican rice.   I really like their green chile sauce, but I noted that the chicken was pretty bland the last time I had it. I definitely expect more seasoning in my Mexican food. I always pass on the beans and get all-rice for my side. Now, I love rice in a way that I'm not sure I can properly express, so understand that when I say that the rice is 'meh' that I *really* mean it. Whatver is \"new\" about it isn't doing it for me. The quesadillas are also good (albeit difficult to screw up), but definitely avoid the carnitas on this one - they were super greasy and it really didn't work out that well. The garden quesadilla is packed. I'll occasionally get the nachos (appetizer) as my meal (again, difficult to get wrong). And finally, the chile verde soup is decent. Their salsa is 'meh' and the in-house chips are only OK, which is sad.  Being part of the Hilldale Mall area, you'll find parking on the street out front, if you're lucky, otherwise there's a couple of parking ramps behind the buildings that make for a short enough walk. I've met here with co-workers, but also with friends, and everyone seems happy enough. I've never had, or witnessed, any complaints. Still, I have to say that for Mexican, in my opinion, Pasqual's is only passable. I'll return, but primarily out of convenience."}
{"text":"Yes, we knew it was Cinco de Mayo did you? We went to dinner last night on Cinco de Mayo at Pascual's Cantina. We arrived knowing it would be a busy night and the place would probably be crowded. They do not except reservations for parties of less than eight so we were very much prepared to have a  wait. We went into the bar and ordered a round of drinks. It took several minutes to get the round because the bartender had run out of clean glasses. The margaritas were yummy as advertised. We were finally seated at our table just about within the one hour we were told. By the time we were seated at our table the crowd had really thinned and there were several tables in the dining room open. We ordered starters: a order of tortilla chips and salsa and a full order of nachos. We ordered another round of drinks and were again told there would be a delay as there were still no clean glasses. The chips and salsa arrived without delay but the nachos took another 45 minutes to arrive. Our entrées were finally dropped at 8:50 PM at which point everyone had pretty much decided this was a \"one and done\" try at this restaurant. When we expressed our disappointment to the server who,of course is not responsible for these issues,she actually told us \"you should try us again on a night when we're not busy.\" We were a little chagrined at being chastised that we had selected the wrong night for them to provide good service and good food. If their aim is to not ever be busy I think they may succeed in this. However I question whether or not the person who invested all that money in the rehabilitation of that building also has an attention for them to never be truly busy. The service and attitude with it suggests that Pascual's will have as much success as Fife's did... Great bar service but uneven,unreliable food service and food quality. Whoever's cooking in the kitchen seems to subscribe to the \"if a little spice is good a lot must be terrific\"school of thought."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant gets a lot of hype in the Madison area. I've been there a few times and don't think there's anything special about it. The food is really 'meh' and the atmosphere/service doesn't add anything to it."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while killing time before seeing a flick at Sundance because the cuz was in the mood for fake Tex-Mex. Overall, quite good! If you're looking for Tex-Mex or legit Mexican, I hate to break it to you, but: you're in the north. Stop being so hopeful about every little dumpy joint you come across. It ain't happening.  The chips were alright, but nothing special and not worth $3.95. I wouldn't have even taken the time to talk about them if they were complimentary, but since it was $3.95 for mediocrity I'm gonna call them what they were: mediocre.  I had the fajita chicken wrap, which was so, so good. The spiced mayo was spread evening, making it all just right. I ate half and saved the rest for a later meal because I liked it so much.  Not a terrible place to stop at while shopping around Hilldale or waiting to check out what's playing at Sundance, but not a destination in and of itself."}
{"text":"This particular location is very hit or miss. I've only been here during Happy Hour so I've been somewhat satisfied with the discounted menu. I definitely plan on returning because the food is decent. My husband and I usually order the fajitas to share here.   If anyone knows of any other mexican restaurant in the area..send me a message. It's my favorite cuisine!"}
{"text":"Love Pasqual's and especially their margaritas. It's been a favorite for many years. Love their guacamole, chicken taco salad, and pork quesadillas among other things. The staff are virtually universally friendly, conscientious, and efficient. There have some newer staff who could use some experience, but they are still quite friendly and conscientious.   Definitely miss the Monroe Street location for pre-Badger game brunch and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Pasqual's is reasonably priced, well prepared tex-mex fare. The burritos are well seasoned and ingredients are distributed throughout (so you're not just getting the \"sour cream\" bite, then the \"bean bite\", etc).  Their tortilla chips are great, thin and crispy, though perhaps a little on the salty side. Their salsa -- however, is a little bit watery for my tastes.  Having been there a few times -- I can say there is some variation in their cooking staff depending on when you come in. On two occasions my food would be a '4', but on another it was a '2' in quality.   Weekend brunch seems to be when their best chefs are in house so if you are going to try to catch them at their best, that'd be the time to do it!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here an hour and a half before we had to be at an doctor's appointment. We figured that would be enough time to eat.   Whew, were we wrong.   I want to start this off on the positives of this place: nice waitress, tastey blue corn tortillas.   Anyway, to make a long, boring rant short, we waiting just about an hour for our lunch to arrive. I had two tacos and he had a burrito. Essentially, we had only 20ish minutes to eat, get the bill, and book it. The beans and rice looked old. The rice was definitely undercooked (I don't think you're supposed to almost break a tooth on rice). My husband, who has the lowest standards of food (he's a McRib fan) thought his burrito was \"gross\".   My drink was watery.   This place has friendly sevice that moves at a glacier speed and food that tastes old, undercooked, and boring.   Glad-ish I tried it, but will never come back."}
{"text":"If it weren't for this delicious marg I'd have nothing good to say about this place.  Bargain-Bin, Chain-store, Ugly American Mexican with no frills.   Fine place to get drunk and forget what real food is like.  The chips and salsa cost money and they come out cold.  Egregious."}
{"text":"Incredible food, service and ambiance. I had a blueberry lemon margarita, enchiladas, pinto beans and rice. My husband had Sangria, tamales, black beans and rice. Flavor was great and I would come here every week if I was local."}
{"text":"I am really happy Pasqual's is back in Verona!  They've got the same great food and margaritas with an upscaled interior and really attractive bar area."}
{"text":"I have such mixed love for Pasqual's. I still remember going to Pasqual's on Monroe street while being in middle school with my parents and sister. I remember really enjoying the food while there.   To begin, the chips and guacamole are still what I remember them to be. The chips had great flavor and I could have devoured 3-4 plates to myself. In addition, our server was really nice, and was very attentive while I was dining there. I also really like this location because it has a really nice patio place to enjoy the summer nights.   The only downfall about this Pasqual's is that I felt the food was subpar. It was not bad, but I kind of expected a little better. I hoped my burrito had a little bit more cheese or filling inside of it.   But to end on a positive note, there is a bounty of parking spots. They also have great drink options from margaritas, beers, and wine!"}
{"text":"We rented the party room and had spectacular service, a great taco bar, and the lime margaritas on the rocks are stellar. We will definitely look at Pasqual's for further parties."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over Hilldale. Great place for blue corn tortilla cheese enchiladas with green chili sauce. Ok, it's not Santa Fe or Houston, but it is pretty good for transplanted Texan living in beer and brat country. Great guacamole. Admirable service."}
{"text":"I don't know why I come back here but the next time someone suggests Pasqual's, I will most definitely remember how terrible it truly is. The food is inedible. My friend and I ordered guacamole & chips, grilled fish tacos and a cheese quesadilla. The guacamole had a tortilla chip buried in it that had been there long enough that when I tried to fish it out, it was soggy. The fish tacos were absolutely disgusting. Not only were they soggy and wet but they tasted terrible. Even the sides were bad. The black beans & rice that accompanied both dishes were crusty and cold.  To top it all off, when I mentioned to the waitress how terrible the food was, as evidenced by it all still sitting on the plates, she apologized and then brought us the check for the full amount.   Please remind me not to go back."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this location as the east location is okay. The server was very friendly and helpful, he did forget my order of guacamole and we were charged for it..  ( he did correct this) And that the menu says taquito for what is actually just a taco  .. I can't blame the poor guy that the food was so bad my 4 year old niece complained.. I'm not sure how to explain myself but I'll definitely not be visiting this location again. Please if anyone has any suggestions on any Mexican places in this area please feel feel to comment and share.. New to this side of town and love Mexican food or Tex-mex I should say.."}
{"text":"I was meeting some friends for an impromptu visit and Pasqual's Cantina was a good mid-way point.  I have not been to this location before and was happy to see the bar door in the back so I didn't have to walk to the front of the building  (SOOO COLD outside!!).    It was 11:30 am on the Saturday before NYE and it was very empty.  I chalked it up to being before the Orange Bowl and folks were resting before the big game.  My friends beat me there by five minutes and were already seated in a nice sunny spot.  We ordered guacamole, mild salsa, and chips.  I really like the seasoning on the chips and I enjoy their guacamole.  My friend likes to order Street Corn when she sees it on the menu (I have seen her do it at another Madison Mexican/Southwest type restaurant).  Her definition of Street Corn is grilled corn on the cob with seasonings and cheese.  What came out was off the cob and in a bowl.  Chips were served with it.  The description did list the chips but not the \"off the cob\".  The flavor was good but it should have been called a corn dip.  I ordered a single tamale dinner.  The tamale was flavorful and cooked very nice.  The rice and beans on the side were very good too.   I would gladly get this again.  My friends ordered a single enchiladas dinner and the Pasqual Burger.  I did not hear any complaints.  We did order drinks with lunch.  I have had really good Lemon Basil Margaritas at the Hilldale location.  The one I ordered here was kind of forgettable.  I think I would order just a standard margarita next time.  One of my friends ordered a holiday margarita and it was beautiful.  It was good, too.   Service was good for a super quiet day.  I hope to come back and try these location again."}
{"text":"They've recently updates their menu and its made a difference. They have breakfast tacos and other dishes all day. Great addition to give you the Mexican flare but with a twist few others offer for dinner. This place has a nice outdoor section and is very kid friendly. We go almost once a week and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a great place to come with a small child. The food is good and the service is good.  I love the guacamole and their margaritas are amazing. They are a little on the pricier side, but it's not bad when the food is better then most Mexican places I have been to.  Our waitress was very understanding when she saw we had our toddler with us, and made sure to get our food out to us as fast as she could. I tell a lot of my friends that want good Mexican food that this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The location is great and the restaurant is gorgeous but just got back from dinner and although I would be back for the chips and salsa and drinks, the rest of the meal was very difficult to enjoy.  This is opening week so I feel a bit bad for this review, but they have several other restaurants and I feel the food should be up to par with the understanding that service would be slower, the waiters might not know the menu as well, etc.   Our waiter was very nice and helpful but the food was freezing cold (it was clear that it had been sitting for awhile because the cheese was hardened onto the cold beans), and my dish, the fish tacos, tasted like an extremely poor quality cod on tortillas that were so mushy I had to eat them with a fork.  However, I couldn't finish them because the taste/food quality was so poor:(  Luckily I had done a decent job of filling up on chips and salsa, which were amazing."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place...I keep trying it and continue to be underwhelmed. The carnitas is simultaneous over and under seasoned. It's just all wrong. I have a thing about restaurants using pre-bagged, pre-shredded cheese. No thanks. Good drinks, great dips. Eat the nachos."}
{"text":"I know people love Pasqual's but I just can't get on the bandwagon.   The food for me just isn't anything special. However, I did like the chips and salsa options we have chosen.  It is in a really neat building. I love anything that's wood, brick or has a warehouse feel. There is also an outside patio which is desirable in summer months. We've had decent servers both times we've gone.  I know they have Happy Hour specials and I would probably try that out with drinks and appetizers. For dinner, I would probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Definitely a two star experience.  The building is beautiful. The drinks were great. But I can't get over how dull and unsatisfactory the entire food experience is. You'd think they would really try to justify this beautiful location with some great food. Honestly, I was not impressed. The first offense was the temperature of the food (lukewarm) and the second offense was the puddle of refried beans taking up half my plate. It was just nothing special, and certainly not worth the 35 minutes it took to arrive.   This place would have my respect if they AT LEAST had complementary chips and salsa. I think it's the least they could do if we are to wait such a long time for our meals. Bravo on the delicious margaritas though!  I'm sorry Pasqual's. You could be great, but I need to feel like I'm getting a bit more bang for my buck here."}
{"text":"Took Grandma and the family out for lunch here yesterday. Had not been here in a while, but remembered it being a fun place. The restaurant has fantastic decor, but that is about it. We had some tacos - shrimp and fajita, and grandma ordered enchiladas. The fajita taco was pretty good, shrimp tacos were bland, the jalapeño/shrimp wrapped in bacon app was fantastic, chips and salsa were good too.   Here is where it went wrong...SERVICE! We waited about 7 minutes before anybody came to our table to get us drinks. Our waiter seemed good at first, but would disappear for long periods of time. We ended up being at the restaurant for well over an hour because of this. However, all of this is tolerable. What caused this to be (initially a one star) review was the fact that grandmas food came out wrong - she received a bland dry crappy tamale. When we finally were able to alert our waiter (8-10 minutes later) he told us, rudely, that we were wrong and she had ordered that. The only thing that saved this from being one star was that the manager came out and apologized for her waiter being rude and took the tamale off the bill.  Worst service I have had in a long time. I will never eat here again.  Food gets 2.5 stars, service zero"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place for margaritas (on the rocks).  Pretty average Mexican food.  Not a bad place, but not exceptional either.  This is a great place to come for happy hour (half price margaritas), but there's better places to go at other times. However, they did give us free nachos when the kitchen had messed them up twice so that was pretty great of them!"}
{"text":"The policies of this establishment are very poor.  My colleagues and I agreed to meet here after work, within a 30-minute time frame.  There was no one in the restaurant and they still refused to seat us until \"everyone in a party was there.\"  We were not even sure how many were going to show...it was quite frustrating...   The chips (which you must pay for) are tasty, but I only give the margaritas 2 limes."}
{"text":"Holy crap they stole $34.84 from me.  Didn't want to pay with my card here but if you want to start a tab here you have to give them a card which is normal.  But I told the bartender not to run the card I want pay in cash.  He said no problem. At the end he ran my card anyway, when I said I wanted to pay in cash he said don't worry I'll cancel that payment on the computer.  When I said are you sure you can do that he said oh yah no problem.  I then gave him cash and went home. The next day I saw on my credit cards transactions at the bank and saw I was still charged $34.84.  I got a print out and took to Pasquals and showed the manager and she said don't worry it takes a few days.  After about a week it still wasn't returned to my card. Went back and showed the manager again.  She said that I had my days mixed up and it was returned.  After some more arguing with her, she called me a name I won't repeat and went up the stairs into there office.  And never came back out.  I was so tired of trying to get my money back I kissed said screw it and swallowed the loss.  Never will be back there again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times . . . something about the food is just off.  I can't quite tell if it's too cheesy or too salty/acrid, but for some reason tastes better eaten a couple days later as leftovers.  Service was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"The service here in all aspects was just incredibly slow. Granted, we came here as a fairly large group to celebrate a friend's birthday but quite honestly there were multiple times where we were just waiting to get the waiters' attention to attend to us.   First, it took some time for the waiters to take our drink orders. Keep in mind that most of the cocktails cost closer to $9 per drink for a small glass size (not exactly the best price per drink value).   We ordered plenty of appetizers of chips and fries for the table and finished it quickly, and then began the long wait before our order was taken for our entrees. Keep in mind, the rest of this place isn't even crowded!   When our food finally arrived, I was quite disappointed in the portion size of the Breakfast Bowl that I ordered. The quality of food wasn't awful, but I couldn't even finish it since it just wasn't any good.   As for the checks, it was another wait game, and before we know it, we were asked to leave since the store was closing in five minutes. Quite honestly, I probably wouldn't take the time out to come back here given the slow service and the poor quality of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is bush league.  Did I have  great time? Yes-but it was only because of the fun people we came with.  There are so many better Mexican restaurants in Madison/Middleton with better food and better Margaritas.  Best margaritas in Mad-town are: El Dorado Grille (and great everything else!!) and of all places PF Chang's (I know, crazy).  btw, the \"Mexican Embassy\" Abuelo's right next door to PF Chang's makes a terrible margarita. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this restaurant. I ordered the shrimp taco and it was ABSOLUTELY horrible!! The shrimp were soooo small, I couldn't even taste them. There was so much cabbage, I thought I was eating a cabbage taco instead of a shrimp taco."}
{"text":"This is a five-star review in praise of a single dish:  the enchiladas.  I first started getting Pasqual's enchiladas (always the blue corn tortillas;  always the green sauce; always with the black beans) decades ago.  I've fallen off the wagon many times, and then thought, after a period of years - - hey - - why not stop in for the enchiladas at Pasquals?   Well, it is time to fully give them the praise they so richly (and I do mean 'richly') deserve.  Are there better enchiladas anywhere?   I think not.   The toothy-ness of the blue corn shells, smothered just enough by the sauce and cheese are pure perfection.   That the enchiladas are lurking in the middle of the plate,  in a sea of bold black beans, flaky savory rice,  zesty sauce, and just the right amount of gooey smothering cheese - - this is sheer excellence.  I made a little mistake,  after decades of getting one cheese & one chorizo enchilada, to get one with grilled veggies this time.  I suppose the grilled veggies were good for me, but it kind of broke up the orgy of sensual smoldering smooth rapture - - just a tiny bit.  I also asked for that particular enchilada to be served with the mole' sauce.   I don't think they are up nights slaving over a large black kettle with chocolate shavings and arcane spices to produce the mole' - - but I still kind of like it.   The chorizo enchilada with the green sauce, was, however, so completely sublime that words cannot describe it,  but I will continue to attempt to employ words.   What's remarkable is that their chorizo is not the dark, biting, acidic stuff you might be familiar with - - it is instead a deft, flavorful, mild but still richly satisfying savory sausage, that goes with everything else on the plate like Tristan goes with Isolde.  OK, I'm going a bit over the top here, but, for me, the enchiladas at Pasquals are a totally iconic meal.   It is simply a whole that is massively more than the sum of its parts, and a complete masterpiece of the enchilada ouvre,  pardon my French."}
{"text":"The service was great, but unfortunately the food was terrible. I ordered a sampling of the \"street food.\" The mini tostadas were three tortilla chips (literally) with cold black bean puree and dried out shrimp. The margaritas were ok, but a little sweet and thick for my taste. It's also very loud, with hard floors and bare walls, nothing absorbs the sound. I hope they fine tune the issues and do well in this new location."}
{"text":"Love the patio. My fresh strawberry margarita was tasty and strong. My taco salad with shredded beef was super mushy. Couldn't eat very much of it. The beef was covered in some sort of gravy. I would get it without meat next time."}
{"text":"So if I was just coming in for a taco or burrito, I would rate this maybe a 4. You won't find authentic Mexican cuisine, but Pasqual's is SOOO much more! They have the largest and best tequila menu of any place I've been to in the US and what's more is that they understand what they are serving. My husband and I joined the tequila tour that offers many benefits and a wonderful variety each time we come in. I have to give a big thank you to Seth, who is the greatest bartender of all times. Now, onto the food...My favorite items are the chicken nachos and anything with the black beans. They use quality cheese and their chicken is moist and well seasoned. We've never ordered anything we didn't like and have been dozens of times."}
{"text":"I like Pasquals, some people complain its not traditional. But I don't think they get its Tex-Mex not Mexican. I like the enchiladas and I've had they're Street tacos which were really delicious, one with carnitas, chimichurri, and feta cheese was super good.   They have great margarita special and the margaritas themselves are really good but strong, which isn't a bad thing. I like the outdoor seating at this Hilldale location, it can get busy though. So if you wanna sit outside on a nice day be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Pasqual's has always been a family favorite for us. Growing up with a sister with egg and nut allergies, it made it difficult to go out to eat very often, but we found out that Pasqual's had some dishes that were safe for her, and it became our go-to spot. I've been to almost all of their locations over the years, but this one is my favorite of the ones that are open right now. (I really liked another one, but it's closed now.) The Hilldale location has a spacious interior and is more bright and open than some of the others I've visited.  Let's start with the chips and salsa (and guac). They used to give you a basket of chips and salsa for free, but gone are the days of that. However, their chips have the most incredible seasoning, let alone their fantastic salsa and guac, so we usually still end up ordering a round or two. (I believe refills are still free.)  I almost always order the Double Taco with black beans on the outside and chicken on the inside. The Double Taco is a hard shell taco, wrapped with a soft shell taco with a layer of either black beans, pinto beans, or guac in between. On the inside it comes with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, olives, sour cream, and green onions with your choice of a protein. Let me be the one to tell you, shredded chicken is the way to go! It's so juicy and flavorful! Mmmmm! You can order the Double Taco a la carte at lunch time, but at dinner time it comes with delicious sides of rices and beans!  I hear they also have tasty drinks, but since I mostly came here as a minor, I have yet to sample any of those. Someday soon though I hope!"}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday night because we had a taste for margaritas. To our delight a flyer on the table advertised half-price margaritas in conjunction with their 10-year anniversary.   No, the waitress said, that's only on weekdays. Perhaps the information shouldn't be out on the table when it doesn't apply, we said. It's our information, and we can leave it on the table if we want, the waitress said.   So we walked out because that kind of rudeness is simply not acceptable. Nor will we be patronizing this establishment again."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a new go to place on the East side of Madison! We came in and sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender (Craig) & given menus. We were also told about their happy hour specials. We ordered half price margaritas, which were served in a pint glass and tasted fantastic. I must warn you, these are potent! We also ordered a 1/2 order of Nachos ($4), which came out heaping a large plate that was more than enough for 2 of us. No processed cheese in sight:) After polishing those of, we went for it and ordered some tacos off the street food section of the menu. We got a few with jerk chicken, that brought the heat and others that were packed with carnitas. At approx $2 each, these were a great deal and came out on warm corn tortillas with toppings such as pickled onions, chimichurri, fresh cilantro, etc. (As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about when I can stop by for more tacos) Each time that we ordered, our food was out in approx 10 minutes, which was fast considering how busy the bar was. I found the bartenders to be engaging and attentive. It's great to see the old Fyfe's come back to life and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Menu is limited, drinks are pricey.  Had the fish taco's, VERY fishy taste and would not order again.  Was with a party of 6 and cannot say that anyone thought the food was outstanding.  Was not busy but they also had the music way too loud we had a hard time having a conversation,.Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"This is truly the most bland food I have ever tasted. The salsa is bland, my fajita wrap came out as your run of the mill chicken wrap with mayo, and the piscorita I had was lime juice. I can't think if the last time I was this disappointed with food."}
{"text":"Great prices and delicious food!  It's hard to find both sometimes but this place does.  There is plenty of parking as well, which makes it easier for groups of friends.  Service can be slow sometimes, but when you go out on the weekends, that can be expected."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a date night with my wife. We were sitting in the main dining area and right away noticed the the acoustics are bad. You have to talk loudly to hear each other. We got a couple margaritas and chips with salsa and guacamole, all delicious. Ordered our food and waited and waited and waited. Food finally arrived and was again delicious. So I gave 3 stars for great food but poor atmosphere and slooooooowwwwwww service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend keeps bugging me to right and updated review because we really do love Pasquals and come here or order carry out about once a week....  Delicious things that we always order: -Margs (I think their house margs are still 1/2 price on Mon/Tuesday but we usually come on a different night and there's always a monthly special that is less expensive) -Chips and Pico -Flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel (although we do miss their scotcheroos)  The only complaint is that they now have a steep up-charge (like $5) for steak, and it had been free in the past. Everything else is great. Service has improved too."}
{"text":"I love this Pasqual's location. The interior design is cute and fun and the bar is excellent. It has a nice atmosphere overall. They have lovely outdoor seating for good weather and its location is great in the newly remodeled Hildale mall. Of everything they offer on the menu I think their chicken quesadillas are outstanding. They do carry out (pick up at the bar, so you can by-pass the line of people who are waiting to be seated) if you want a faster option or bring it elsewhere."}
{"text":"YAY! Pasqual's is back in Verona, right where it used to be on Cross Country.  We were so disappointed when they closed that location a few years ago.  We stopped in on a Friday night, and the place has been completely renovated and was packed.   It is much more like the Hilldale location, with a beautiful bar.  We were only there for margaritas and nachos, but both were just as good as always.  Their margaritas are one of the best in town, no skimping on the booze.  (They are pricey, but you can get them 1/2 price on Monday and Tuesday.)  The nachos are great, we got the shredded chicken.  You can definitely make a meal from the large order.  Our server was attentive without being bothersome.  The menu is a bit different than the other locations.  There are burgers on this one and not all of the other offerings that the other locations have.  I am anxious to try some of the new items now that they are back in our neighborhood.  We have been eating at Pasqual's since there was only one location on Monroe St. and cannot think of a time we have been disappointed.  The only thing I wish they hadn't changed is they no longer have their menu on that colorful chalkboard.  Who's idea was that to get rid of it???"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised this has low ratings on here. I went here twice in the last month and had great experiences both times. It's not gourmet or anything but I thought they had tasty Mexican fusion foods. Good lunch spot and nice patio. For more authentic Mexican, see Taqueria Guadalajara."}
{"text":"Usually good to eat at - tried carry out and HUGELY disappointed. While it was ready timely the order was messed up and when you're looking forward to something and it's wrong the feeling is amplified.  Not too keen on going back for awhile given the money I feel I just wasted.. as trump would say - SAD"}
{"text":"3 stars. To be honest, I liked it before.  The new atmosphere is unorignal and nothing like the contemporary casualness of the old set up.  I miss the ordering set up, and the casualness of the restaurant.  The menu has changed, no more tamales. I was very sad.  The food portions are generous, and the salsa is still good.  Enchiladas were still good, I went for the verde with cheese.  They also seem to have more vegetarian options? which is a good thing.  But I am nostalgic of the old place.  The staff seems inexperienced, and the music they play isn't inviting.  I'm hoping they go back to their roots with some of the stuff.  It seems that they are more focused on drinks at this location, and I don't know how this will play out with the location.  I am partial to this old company, and hope for the best. But damn, I want my tamales back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the comfortable, colorful, appropriately southwestern atmosphere, but the food just didn't pack a good punch. I ordered the veggie enchiladas, and although they looked great on my plate alongside beans and rice, they just didn't taste like much at all. I ordered mine with a blue corn tortilla, which I was excited to see as on option, but it lacked the great corny flavor I was hoping for. The red chili sauce had no heat to it and the cheese seemed to be more grease than anything. I was very surprised that such a great looking dish could be so lacking in flavor. The service, however, was friendly and speedy. I liked that you could order small or large potions of most menu items. I'll probably visit Pasqual's again sometime in the future, but I think I'll call ahead to make sure the kitchen hasn't run out of salt..."}
{"text":"Update:  They ended up taking $10 off my bill and refunding it to my credit card.  I would go here for the skinny margarita but not the food...ever.  OMG...how hard is it??? First I order the queso and chips which what comes is a COLD molded scoop of something resembling spicy processed pimento cheese dip that I send back because it's disgusting.  Then the lady who was waiting on me offers to bring me some salsa for my chips...OK...so she tells me what they have so I said you can bring me the tomatillo.  I didn't know because no one ever told me that the TERRIBLE salsa she brought me was replacing the TERRIBLE queso.  The guacamole also was not good but sort of familiar so I ate it.  Then all of a sudden there is some other waiter, (with red hair and a terrible acne problem) who I don't know who he is, acting like he is waiting on me who brings me my bill and then can't stop talking and just take of the situation and take the $5 off the bill for the nasty food I didn't eat after I EXPLAIN THIS ENTIRE STORY TO HIM!!! He hems and haws because he says he didn't know and blah blah blah....& tells me \"this isn't a Tex Mex restaurant it's more Southwest Mex and for me to think \"Mesa desert\" & finally says: \"Do you want me to get the manager?\" OMG...really you can't take care of the situation and now I have to repeat myself to another person for the $5 that should have been removed from my bill in the first place due to your nasty food that I sent back!!! But ya know what fine...I don't have time for your incompetence for a WHOLE $5 so you can keep my $5 & the $4 tip I left on the $20 bill.  Welcome to you Yelp review for my trouble and getting ripped off and completely put out by your numbskull behavior and not just taking care of the situation by removing the $5 from my bill instead of arguing with me about! RIDICULOUS!!  & FYI: I've been to the Mesa desert in the Southwest in both Arizona and New Mexico where you know Hatch green chiles come from and I got the same kind of queso as you get in Texas considering they use Hatch green chiles in their HOT queso dip as well from Hatch, New Mexico.  Rolling my eyeballs..."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and the portion sizes are just right. Service is quick and servers are very pleasant. Uncomfortable seating and down market ambience."}
{"text":"Mole burrito and street tacos were delicious!! Service was good, not a long wait. Must try the margaritas they will make your clothes fall off lol"}
{"text":"Four adults and two kids. We ordered two chips and salsa's, two margaritas, and four sodas and one small fajita appetizer. $64. The waiter acted as if we were a nuisance. Nothing special and will not be coming back again."}
