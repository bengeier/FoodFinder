{"text":"We really like the barbecue turkey that they have added to the menu.     Great take out option, be sure to phone ahead.    I do miss the unlimited sides that are available if you dine in"}
{"text":"Casual and friendly place.  Food is high average for bar b que.  Portions are large.  Margaritas excellent.  Thin, crispy onion rings."}
{"text":"The closest thing to Texas barbecue I've had in 20 years. I love this place. Make sure to order the Mac & Cheese as well Excellent"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this BBQ. I'm a BBQ snob considering I was raised in Texas where the BBQ is real BBQ! Waldo's is definitely Texas BBQ style! Delicious! Not to mention the excellent customer service the restaurant offers. They have great specials during the week Monday - Thursday for kiddos. Kiddos get a free meal with a purchase of an adult meal. They have great specials on beer too. They offer draft to bottled beer as well as a full bar. The BBQ sauce .......IS THE BEST! the french  fries are to die for and the pork sand which is out of this world! I've never had anything that I disliked at  Waldo's or have ever had a poor experience with the wait staff. Excellent customer service and Excellent food!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places.We went tonight, to learn that things have definitely changed.The brisket was super fatty & undercooked.When I asked to have it cooked longer I was told \"that's the way it is\". The manager was not kind in any way, and instead decided to tell me I was wrong and should've ordered something other than brisket. The  waitress said that they no longer offer unlimited sides...and that a lot has changed in the past month.   It's sad to see a local restaurant go downhill like this.Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not much good to say, other than waiter was pleasant. Maybe we've been spoiled by Joes."}
{"text":"Waldo's BBQ sauce is definitely the best I've ever had. Smother it on pulled pork, brisket, mac and cheese, or even drink it straight!"}
{"text":"This food has gone downhill. I went there for my birthday dinner and we dropped $100 for dinner. The food tasted literally like they took a TV dinner and heated it up. I dont know what happened here but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We pass by here all the time and finally decided to stop in. In one word: Fantastic! It's a little mix of BBQ from all over the country but they do it phenomenally well. Everything from the sausage links to brisket to pulled pork to the cornbread and sweet tea is probably the best in Arizona. Definitely give the Louisiana Hot sauce a try. Mixed with a little of their original and it's perfect. Our waiter Scott couldn't have been better. Extremely attentive but not over- bearing, and super polite. We will absolutely be back! And they have true fall off the bone BEEF ribs!! Can't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Went here because Allison's was closed.  I got the beef ribs and my son got the brisket sandwich.  Ribs were all fat and looked like they were a couple days old.  The meat on the sandwich had an artificial smoke taste that was overpowering.  The macaroni and cheese was runny, too.  The only thing good was the fried okra.  Thoroughly disappointed.  Don't know how this place has four stars."}
{"text":"I have been craving a baked potato for the longest. Coming from Texas I  was excited to see what AZ had for BBQ. The baked potato was the size of my palm. I was dumbfounded wondering why it was so small. The chicken was soft but the sausage was another story. The ice tea was good though."}
{"text":"Quick to take order and serve.  They didn't have enough change so I didn't get any coins back.  Food was alright if you like food with no flavor.  Spent 8 bucks for an oily sandwich and dry and oily mac n cheese.  Order was to go and wasn't offered a fork for the mac n cheese.  I think I will spend my money elsewhere.  The parking lot smells like raw sewage."}
{"text":"Waldo's BBQ is amazing. Food was incredible and the waiter even hooked us up with an extra side. Wonderful restaurant and family friendly. Some of the best food I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"Southern BBQ made the way u would expect to find in GA, SC or KC. I had baby back ribs. The meat tender falling off the bone as advertised.  Smoked to perfection.  Sides southern style and drinks served in Mason jars. Great neighborhood place worth the drive if in Phoenix"}
{"text":"There were 17 of us and the host did a great job accommodating all of us to seat together. That made us wait a while but it was worth it.   Husband and I ordered sampler plater and peach cobbler for desert: BBQ was tasty and peach cobbler was delicious!"}
{"text":"Typical BBQ hut. Clean & friendly. DO NOT GET THE BEEF RIBS!! Absolutely horrible.  I have no idea why they would even serve them. Gristle, fatty, bland and you spend more time finding edible meat, than eating it. My friend had the pulled pork and loved it! The side portions are large and very tasty. Sorry, but won't be going back any time soon as there are plenty of BBQ choices in town."}
{"text":"Waldo's has excellent food and great, friendly service.  Place was packed with customers of all ages.  I had the sampler with more meat than I could possibly eat (ribs, beef, brisket and chicken); my friend had half rack of ribs and we had tons of leftovers.  Best two sides are mac and cheese and (surprisingly) the sautéed vegetables (excellent seasoning).  Lots of fun!  If you're around in December, drive 10 minutes to check out the Christmas lights at the Mormon Temple.  Tens of thousands of lights. Really!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and absolutely loved the food. Amazing service, personable, and fun atmosphere. Will be coming here a couple more times before heading back to Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Very good bbq. Had the pulled pork sandwich. Waited an hour for our food, they were pretty slammed that night. But they gave us half off on our bill for the wait. I just found a new favorite. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love great BBQ.  This place is good, a solid 4 stars. The meats were smoked well, tender, but not 5 stars. The service was outstanding. They don't skimp on the portions at all, ever free refills on sides if you could possibly eat that much.  Want BBQ in Mesa? Eat here! You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Not a very good place if you are in a wheelchair.  No ramp and a lip to get over.  Food is good and people are cool."}
{"text":"I only visit Mesa once a year, but I always make sure to eat at Waldo's. They serve my favorite BBQ, period. And don't miss the grilled vegetables - they're done perfectly."}
{"text":"If you've never had good, authentic BBQ, you might think this place is good.. For me? Completely underwhelming. Very bland, thoughtless food. Good enough service, decent pricing, but man...   Waldo's... SALT!! Don't be scared of it, your run/bark tasted like nothing!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Mesa Arizona , service is good, full bar, ice cold beer and please try the BBQ Beef ribs or sampler. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Full disclaimer: I am from Vancouver, and as such am not a barbecue authority. You want to talk sushi or seafood or salads, we can do that, but barbecue is a rare treat for me.  What I do know is good food and service, and Waldo's has good food and service. Right when you walk in, the smell gets you. It's like being embraced by a warm smoky hug. Next, thr friendly staff show you to your table, ask what you'd like to drink, and they never stop being nice throughout your entire visit. Anything you need, they will do their best to make it happen.  Husband and I each ordered a sample platter to try a little of everything. Did not disappoint, would order again. The meat was so flavourful. The texture was excellent - not too fatty, not too dry. That bbq sauce had a nice vinegar-y tang.  The sample platter comes with unlimited sides but we were way too full to order more.  If I lived here full time, I'd be in big trouble. Absolutely 100% recommemded."}
{"text":"Took 45 mins to get our food (and it wasn't even busy at all). The only thing the waitress had to say was that the cook probably just lost my order (like no big deal). The waitress suggested the wet ribs, but forgot and she brought me dry ones instead.  She also totally messed up my wife's order as well. Not sure if this is their usual way of treating customers, but it was our first time...and definitely our last.  I can deal with the mistakes, but not the bad service or poor attitude displayed by staff."}
{"text":"I have been  told to go here that the food is really good.  So today i decided to go with my family and give it a try. The food was really good the service was excellent the food came out fast and on time.  I had the sampler platter and it came with pork chicken brisket. I have to say it was the best i had in a long time . My husband got the pulled chicken bbq sandwich and he said it was really good. But the one thing i have say bad on is there bath rooms where not that clean and they need to keep up on that better.  But besides that I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the portion sizes. My husband got the Sampler and it was only slightly larger than a child's size portion and for $15.99 we expected a full meal not one sausage, 3 small cuts of brisket and a handful size portion of pulled beef. The only saving grace was their bbq sauce. The fried okra was also good. Our server wasn't the most pleasant of waitresses and made us feel like she was annoyed if we asked her for a side of ranch or if they had military discount (only on Thursdays). We were charged a 4 star price for a 2 star quality meal. Overglorified fast good joint catering to snow birds. Exteremly loud, could barely hear each other.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I like Waldos because I can walk to this location the food it that was fair is very casual the food is good we go there when we don't feel like cooking a meal for the evening"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre BBQ at best, servers and Catering manager talk badly about other staff to customers, and their business to business ethics are very low. Please support other local BBQ establishments that support your local community and take pride in what they do."}
{"text":"Service was fast and attentive.  The baby back ribs were done perfect. The potato wedges were ok but I recommend ordering an alternative side.  The portions were more than adequate.  You can't go wrong with Waldo's for quality and price."}
{"text":"As I was cycling around East mesa last week I came across Waldos BBQ and had to stop in and check it out.  Im glad I did.  It was exactly what I was looking for, for lunch that day.  I was having trouble locking up my bike outside as they dont offer a bicycle rack out front.  The hostess, Ashley, came out with a huge smile and told me if I wanted to bring my bike inside while I at it would be totally fine.  I would give this place 4 stars based on that encounter alone.  Ashley was great!!  Got me to my table and seated right away and she even brought me my beverage.  Cant say enough about a good hostess.  I was then greeted by a hostess, Pam, and she took my order.  I had to get the pulled pork along with the spiciest thing they had to offer.  The pulled pork was melt in your mouth amazing and the bbq sauce was one of the best i have ever tried in my life.  So flavorful, tangy, sweet but with a hefty spicy kick.  Its not for the timid.  Everything was delicious and the service and atmosphere was great.  Again, just what I was looking for.  I'd say waldos is a must try if you're in east Mesa or near any of their other locations in the valley.  For a food specific review of Waldos BBQ, visit my Blog site at azspicycycler.com.  Thanks for a great meal Waldos!!  Ill certainly be riding by your place again."}
{"text":"My parents raved about this place to me.. Couldn't say enough about the amazing food and service. Sadly, this was not the case 2nd time around. Consistency is key, but it seems like this something they lack. Waitress seemed rude and impatient and when she let us know that they were completely out of all beef products, she was unwilling to substitute other meat for us. Also, let me note that it was 6 pm when they ran out of beef... At a BBQ restaurant. When we were a little confused by the whole situation the waitress seemed to get more rude, like it was our problem. I will never eat here again and won't ever mention it to another person. Good luck with your current staff and business model, it seems to be working great for you (sarcasm)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, The beef and pork is tender and juicy,  we get it every time we have a family gathering, The service is fast and aways makes us feel at home, I  recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves barbecue."}
{"text":"Were from out of town and came across Waldos on yelp. So glad we found it as the service and food were amazing. When you walk in the door you know it's going to be some great food and we were not disappointed. Our server Scott went above and beyond to take care of us, great advice on menu items. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim, was in town by myself and hungry. It looked almost closed from the outside but was PACKED inside. I'm not a bbq expert by any means but was very impressed with the food. Had the sampler, liked the bbq pork best, loved the bbq sauce, service was great even though busy, and will be going back again before I leave town. Delicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give -*'s I would. Way too expensive for area. Food was just ok. French fries were sry & looked shrivled up.  Wings just ok. Beer prices are outrageous. Going  to restroom was like walking  into a sauna. Invest in air conditioner! Would not recommend  this place to anyone ! G"}
{"text":"This is the easiest review I have ever had to make.   Hands down best BBQ I have ever had.  I ordered the sampler with baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket.   The ribs melted off the bone, the pulled pork was my favorite,  the brisket was great but the pulled pork and ribs were so over the top the brisket was left in the shadows.    Sides I had the cowboy beans and Mac and Cheese,  beans were ok and the Mac and cheese was really good, but again the meat just overshadowed it all I just took a taste and brought it home  All the sauces come on the side,  all 4 were unique and tasty.   The original was at the top of my list but I suggest asking for all of them to taste.   I have had BBQ all over Austin, tried it in St. Louis and few places in CA.  I will put Waldo's up against any of them."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my book club.  First thing I noticed was the drink specials.  Bonus for $3 rum and coke night!  They didn't mind us all being on separate cheques, but they did automatically charge a gratuity.  After we ordered, we were given complimentary corn bread, which was a nice touch!   I ordered the Smoked Turkey Plate with the original sauce, and had fried corn on the cob and green chile mac and cheese for sides.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The mac and cheese was creamy and flavourful, and I usually find mac and cheese bland, so that is high praise from me.    Having moved here from St. Louis, which is a town that loves its BBQ, as well as having it in many other big BBQ towns, I have to say, this place is legit.  Thumbs up and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Yum! Great hole in the wall bbq joint"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to hit up a Waldo's for a while.  My husband and I came in for dinner and had their Tennessee special a few nights ago.   As I walked into the restaurant, the smell of BBQ was fabulous and mouth watering.  The service was good and the facility had a cool ambiance as a neat BBQ joint.     The pulled pork was amazing, but what ever they served with it (I think they called it country ribs) was awful.   Dry, stringy and tough.   While neither my husband or I ate more tan 4 bites of this meat that filled over 1/2 of our plate, when the waitress asked how our food was and took away those  1/2 full plates, she did not ask if there was a problem.   Most people with f1/2 ull plates would be asking for a box to take home the leftovers.    We were super disappointed in the quality of the food and the lack of the server's recognition to the signs that we were unhappy with what we were given."}
{"text":"The meat was what i would call partially deep fried, loaded in fat and thensauce was like thick syrup. Not good and very  expensive for the portions."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times in the past couple years. The decor is awesome and really gets you ready to have some BBQ with all the pigs and funny signage posted on the wall. The prices are a super bargain when it comes to BBQ.  The drinks come in mason jars which adds to the whole theme. The cornbread they bring out is warm and soft and is a nice snack.   Now onto the real part the BBQ. I ordered a sampler plate which included 4 meats.   Baby Back Ribs - full of flavor and meaty, just not as tender as I like them.  I believe the meat should pull apart from the rib with a little pull.  Hot link - from the first bite it had that snap I love and juices started to pour out.  Also, it had a great amount of spiciness to give it that kick.     Pulled pork - they gave a generous portion, but was average in taste.  I added some vinegar and hot sauce to liven it up.   Brisket - Upon first appearance it had a nice smoke ring around the meat that I love, but after that pure disappointment.  It had no flavor and appeared to be low quality beef.  I definetly had to add BBQ sauce to this to make it somewhat edible.       The sides here are great.  The horse radish mash potatoes were Awesome, beans, macaroni and corn were really good too. And they keep refilling your sides until you can't take it anymore.   Also, it's a great spot to bring kids.  My kids devoured their meals and had some of mine.  I highly recommend this place. I am just hoping it was a bad day for the brisket."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been a fan of waldos bbq since I moved here in 2003,at that time it was located on Thomas and hayden,I used to love it there. N e ways its 2011,and I was asked, if u could eat anything for Yur birthday,what would it be? Without thinking I replied waldos bbq country ribs w/ sauteed house veggies, spicy fries,mustard bbq sauce and a sweet tea. so we found this one on main in mesa,and as u can imagine,I have mixed feelings on my way,I am excited cuz I used to crave and eat this twice a week while I was in college in 03,at the same time its 8 years later and my expectations are thru the roof,becuz I so long to satisfy this longing for this fond memory of great simple bbq,not muddled by trend or times.so finally we get there and I see the pink pig and I smile deep down,we walk in and its the same saw dust on the ground just like i remember,we were seated and they brought out a huge mason jar filled to the threading w/ fresh sweet tea,just like I remember,then they follow w/ complimentary green Chile corn bread and butter,just like I remember,then we order thru our engaging,smiling and menu savvy staff,just like I remember,in the time it takes to eat Yur cornbread,the food arrives,and with all the denile almost gone I taste,and its magic,exactly the same,and I could not believe it,it was like reliving and fond dream. I was reaquanted w/ a love I thought I would never find again. It really was perfect and I want to commend the ownership of waldos and be the first to say thank u. For Yur hard work.it completely shows in where it matters most that u care,in service and most importantly food,thank u so much. Consistentcy is the single hardest thing to achieve as a restaurant,and u have achieved it. I will always remember my birthday I found my long lost love waldos bbq,I do have to drive a bit to get to it now,but ill b honest,ill walk to it if I have to. It is so worth it."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork, the meat was okay, but very fatty. Baked potato was bland and very over-cooked. The service was seriously lacking. Our server was not friendly and hardly came back to check on us. We had to flag down a different server to ask for something...which she never brought to our table. All and all a very forgettable experience and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine in mid-May of this year.  We had been searching for Big City BBQ (which is out of business), ended up in Mesa, and just picked this place pretty randomly because it wasn't much further from where we already were.  Not a bad choice at all!  The BBQ sauce is delish, the meats were well cooked, and the meatballs in the sampler were to DIE for.  This coming from someone who is not a big fan of meatballs or anything ground meat.  I will warn that the meat is pretty \"greasy\" -- but it's the fatty, tasty goodness of the meat that makes it greasy, not extra cooking fats or anything horrible like that.  Although I typically eat healthy and can get sick from greasy foods, I had no problem here, even after eating leftovers for several days.  I will be bringing out-of-town visitors here if they ever get a hankerin' for BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food!! The BBQ sauce was unbelievable, and service was great!! Brisket was nice and tender and the onion straws appetizer was out of this world!!"}
{"text":"The floor is higher than it should be as you enter the building and my husband and I both tripped on the way in. We were greeted promptly and escorted to a high top table. We made the mistake of asking if they had anything available that wasn't a high top and we were then seated at a child sized picnic table. Because I'm an old fat woman with bad knees this meant that I got to spend the rest of my visit sitting sideways at this low table. We waited long enough that I'd commented to my husband that we didn't seam to have a server and maybe we should go. Before he could respond the server showed up. Apparently being banished to the kid's table also means that you get to skip the spiel about the menu and which items are particularly good, but you also get left out of the complimentary cornbread. Our meals came in a reasonable amount of time and the meats were very good. The sides are just okay. Near the end of our meal my husband decided to ask about who gets the cornbread, and we did end up being served some. If it were just the food and service I'd plan on going back to Waldo's, but the seating changes everything for  me. Looking around the dining room I only saw 2 regular height tables. This won't matter to most people but anyone with similar mobility issues may want to think twice about dining here. In fairness I want to state that 3 times I was asked if everything was okay and each time I responded with \"it's fine.\" I'd made the mistake of turning down the first table and just wanted to finish my meal and move on. While I won't be returning, I'm pretty sure that my husband would give them a higher rating and will go back at some time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Have been eating here for 25 years. Great BBQ. Cool, non-fancy, unique environment. Definitely a favorite for BBQ. And it is not a corporate chain which is what I like even better."}
{"text":"Just walked in and not many people there. Sat down at bar and bartender was on her phone looking at face book. Waited a bit of time and she put her phone down but still stayed on it while it laid on the counter. Then she picked it back up and started browsing again. We finally walked out. She still didn't look up.  Edit- I did come here for a beer 3 weeks ago, the place was pretty empty but the bartender was very alert. She was different from the one that was in the bar last night though. So adding 1 star."}
{"text":"Brought my family to this place, we did have a large group (9 people). They do not inform you that they add a 18% gratuity to every order, large or not. We waited 30 minutes before even being waited on, and trying to get someone to acknowledge us was awful. They really weren't even that busy. (Many booths and tables open). When we got to order we got no refills on drinks, the food was mediocre the ribs were more fat then meat and the pulled pork was dry. So when we received the bill and saw the 18% gratuity add on we asked about it as service was not that good and were told to bad so sad. We asked that it be removed and we would choose the amount and were told no and that the gratuity was not even for the waitstaff (not sure where it goes, I guess to the owners which is wrong.) I will never again go to this place and will never recommend them to anyone. The staff is very argumentative and does not care about helping the customer. We went to the one in Mesa."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place, as the menu looked enticing. We got a to go order and we were very underwhelmed with the portion size, presentation and lack of flavors in the side dishes. My husband ordered the barbecuban, and while the flavor of the pork was pretty good, he expected double the meat for the $11 price tag of the small sandwich. His choice of potato salad side would have benefited greatly from some salt!  I ordered the BBQ Baker and was very unimpressed. It was a small, simple baked potato and a cup of meat. While, I thought the pulled pork was tasty by itself, the Baker, as an entree, was a disappointment! A little butter, or cheese, or even a few green onions-anything would have gone a long way towards making this an feel like a appetizing entree rather than a plain baked potato and small cup of meat. We also tried their green chili mac and cheese. Another swing and a miss. The pasta was overcooked to the point of being extremely mushy and the cheese sauce had no hint of cheese flavor!! The only bonus was that the green chili wasn't overpowering and was the only source of flavor. Still it was not enough to redeem the dish."}
{"text":"Yes the meat does fall off the bone but it has no flavor. I ordered half a slab and saw no rub on the ribs. I also ordered pulled pork sandwich. It had a decent smoky flavor. This place is okay for non-barbecue connoisseurs. I'm certainly not coming back."}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a try. I liked the sarcastic welcoming from the staff. They were funny and friendly. I ordered the full slab of pork ribs. Got my food pretty quickly and my first rib was good. Then I got to the 2nd and 3rd and it was pretty dry and bland tasting. I liked the baked potato and their fried okra was really crispy and good. I couldn't take the rest of it home. I wasn't offered anything off my bill, so I paid in full, and won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Horrible!!  Food tasted like leftovers!   I believe all they did was change the name on the door from the previous restaurant and are having food shipped in from somewhere else. Horrible horrible horrible. Not to mention the guy sitting across from us was wasted at 2:30 PM!! Save your money go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside but let me tell you the brisket melts in your mouth! The amount off food is crazy and the smells are insane! You should try this place it is awesome.  Also the bbq sauce has a bit of a kick to it but yummy! I purchased 2 jars to take home."}
{"text":"We have tried Waldo's 2 times before and the service has been mediocre at best. The ribs were ok but the chicken tasted like old lighter fluid. Neither of us ate the chicken. So my wife wanted to give them another try on a weekend afternoon. We went in and asked to be seated outside. Unfortunately they don't have that many tables outside and it was full. The bar area had absolutely NO ONE sitting at it so I asked the waitress if we could eat at the bar and she said it was fine handing us menus. We sat at the bar (It had no bartender) for about 10 minutes. Finally a guy came behind the bar and I thought \"great some service\". He never even acknowledged us and started making drinks. He left with a tray full without saying a word to us. Another 10 minutes goes by and still no service, no drinks, NOTHING. It was obvious the place had only 2 servers and one of them was the bartender. Again he came back to make more drinks for the patio area but this time he said he would be back in a minute. Which really turned into 5. We each ordered a beer and were ready to order food but he cut us off, gave us our beers and said he would be right back. Another 15 minutes goes by and no bartender. He finally comes behind the bar, sees that our glasses are empty and asks us if we want another drink. I said we came here to eat! CHECK PLEASE! When he brings the check i tell him we are never coming back because the place is NEVER staffed and the service is TERRIBLE. He said, \"If I comp your drinks will you give us another try?\"  I said \"STRIKE THREE. YOU'RE OUT\" There are much better places in Chandler or Gilbert to spend your money then this place. They obviously don't care about repeat customers."}
{"text":"When  in this part of AZ this is the BBQ place. I got the ribs and loved it. Meal comes with a skillet of BBQ sauce. The sweet potato fries, corn bread were all great, with a large jar of bottomless drink and its done."}
{"text":"It was good overall, but wish the portion was bigger. Like local atmosphere family friendly."}
{"text":"awesome baby back ribs. best i have ever had.  I have made some myself, eaten some in kansas city, atlanta ga. which are very good. This is the best i have had. service is great. prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Terrible.  I ordered a steak medium rare, 25 minutes later they bring a steak that is well done.  I ask for one cooked as I ordered it.  20 minutes later she brings me a steak that was rare and bleeding all over my plate.  To make matters worse, when she took the first steak back, she did not leave a plate for me to at least eat my baked potato while I waited for the second steak.  By the time the second steak was done my side items, which I could not eat because I had no plate to eat them on, were cold.  By this time my family was done eating and still waiting for my food to come.  We have gone there several times over the years, but we will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"By far the best barbecue joint in Phoenix. My family has been coming here for years ever since I was in a high chair. Every time me or one of my friends has a hankering for barbecue, we make the drive to mesa for waldos. I highly recommend this place, you wont be sorry! Don't forget to try the cornbread or the horsey potatoes! (mashed potatoes with horseradish )"}
{"text":"I just wanted to give a Big Thumbs Up to Waldo's BBQ. My niece catered it for her backyard wedding this weekend and it was very tasty. Delivery arrived on time so we didn't have to worry about the meal being late.  All we had to do was throw it on the counter and start filling plates. We also order takeout every so often and it is always good. My favorite is The Pig but we had chicken along with the pork and it was good too."}
{"text":"We love Waldo's! The food is great and so is the service. Great place to take the whole family."}
{"text":"Best bbq in The Valley!! Baby back ribs are fall off the bone tender.. ZERO fat! Original sauce was my favorite.. You must save room for cheese cake in a jar! Wow! Great prices! The staff was helpful hysterical and fast! Very very attentive!"}
{"text":"Food was sub par... And they automatically charged a 13% tip!!! For 4 people!! I will not be coming back..."}
{"text":"I've lived here since 1983 and loved Waldo's. I moved to Vegas for a while and moved back here in 2013. On Friday I drove past Waldo's and stopped in to order take out. I was so excited to taste their food again. I was so disappointed, they have really gone down hill. The sides were awful, beans undercooked, mac & cheese mushy and had no taste, potato salad and cole slaw were equally bad. They say you can never go home again and its true in Waldo's case. I will drive 25 minutes to San Tan Village for Dave's or even 40 minutes to Lucille's but won't drive 12 minutes to Waldos. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with some friends. I've been to Waldo's before but another location some years ago. This one has a tractor and a pink pig of a smoker out front. I'm picky with my BBQ, and I make some killer Q myself, and my friends said if I liked Andrew's BBQ (a few PHX valley locations) I would like Waldo's. It's definitely on par if not better for a few reasons.....  1. Opening course is warm green chile (jalapeno?) cornbread while you figure out what to order. Plain cornbread is so ho-hum and this flavor zing is appreciated! I love chile peppers of all kinds. 2. You can't help but smile at some of the decor which consists of quirky things on the wall and signs saying mildly amusing things. 3. Endless sides and fountain drinks! Mac n cheese, fries, large spiced potato wedges, beans... 4. Full bar.   Waldo's has fair pricing. However I would go for a full rack of ribs since a half is $16.00. I had the large pulled pork sandwich with a side of spiced potato wedges and it was scrumptious. The meat wasn't dry, it was perfect. The sauce is addictive! I like the sauce, and it's served on the side in a small iron skillet. The skillet is what I remember from another location. I think they have a few sauce varieties for the \"wet\" styles of meats. I haven't tried other things since my friend got the quesedilla and my other friend got the pork sandwich as well. Sure would like to try a sampler one of these times. When I try another thing I'll update this review.  Service is excellent and attentive - the place was near empty, but I hope it's just as good when packed. Good for families! I saw one family with 3 kids order the TOWERING MOUNTAIN of onion rings which were large and fresh! I was kinda jealous. Don't eat that decoration when you come in the door! (There's a sign anyway but temptation was HUGE upon first sight.)  All in all Waldo's is a generous experience.  BBQ is all about INDULGENCE, guilty or not, and also one shouldn't feel worried about NOT getting value for your money like at Lucille's (but don't get me wrong, Lucille's is super yum, just the wispy fries are a sad excuse), and Waldo's just the perfect ticket. Even the endless fountain drinks are served in large Mason jars! I'll definitely eat here again when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A family friend died and for his funeral he wanted to have a killer party that his grandkids would have good memories of. (yes they played Freebird at the funeral)   At the party they had bounces, tents and delicious BBQ.  Waldo's catered all the way from Mesa to Avondale.   The guy serving up the food was extremely concerned that we like the food and try as much as possible. He had nothing to worry about. The pork sammich I had was wonderful...the bun was plain and store bought but it really complimented the perfectly cooked pork and the sauce..yes the sauce...Anyone who has read a few of my previous reviews knows that I love my sauces and would eat nearly anything drizzled in the right sauce.   This BBQ Sauce was not spicy like I usually like but it was not overly sweet like I don't. It had just this perfectly lightly sweet tang to it that I can still taste in my mouth. I would eat Dave B.'s Hatrid of myspace if it were covered int he sauce.  The beans were also tasty with plenty of bacon and pork flavor, and the potato salad is the only besides my grandmother's that I have really really enjoyed...Delicious hommade taste to everything!  I think Ed would have been happy with the celebration."}
{"text":"Great food, their ribs were excellent and I will be back for more of their awesome BBQ. Sauces were good too, and everything was BBQ'ed nicely. The staff could be a bit more polite, courteous, and attentive , but don't let that stray you away for their food - it's some of the best BBQ in the valley hands down."}
{"text":"Just left Waldo's on Main in Mesa. I am not sure if it is under new management or not, but something has changed.  My Mom ordered the hamburger. She said it tasted different. The cowboy beans had a different flavor, also. The waitress was not attentive, and when I asked for Banana Pudding, her response was a very harsh \"No\".  Nothing added after it.  The server no longer takes the payment.  You pay at the bar.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Waldos is legit. Ribs are great, pulled pork is great!!! The peach cobbler is out of bounds!!! Great BBQ. Sauces are on point.. Sides are all good."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for 11 years and this is the best BBQ I have had so far. I am from Alabama where BBQ is everywhere and this rates as good as my favorites there!!! I got the sampler with Brisket, pulled pork, and the Texas Hot Link, yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This is an in between review. The service sucked, but the food was good. It's just too bad our server had to ruin our first experience! If we return again, I hope it will be better..."}
{"text":"Being that we come here so often, and it's been a few months, time to update my review... I think the main reason we keep coming back is the staff. Kelley C has proven to be friendly, attentive, and reliable. Makes us feel welcomed at each visit.. frankly, each time we come in or make reservations, we initially ask for her. We strive to introduce new people to our favorite BBQ place so it's important to us for them to have a good impression.   Food consistency has gotten better, though a small disappointment is happy hour dishes keep changing or lack ingredients. Come on guys, step it up a notch and take pride as you plate or present the plate. Overall though, we've found staple dishes that are go to favorites: Pulled pork, chicken sliders,  ribs were surprisingly delicious! Oh, the BBQ sauces! If you're adventurous there's a nice variety to try (I stick with regular, my wife gets the Louisiana). And let me not forget deserts!! Please do not order the peach cobbler!! It is soooo good that I don't ever want them to be out of it when I'm there!!   I think management has addressed previous issues/concerns and now the business is running smoothly.. though I would remind the powers that be that there needs to consistency please!! Coaster or napkin with each dripping glass of beer, certain beers get a garnish? To give or not to give a table the green chili corn bread (outstanding by the way!!)? It shouldn't matter on which server!!   I hate to see trivia go on Tuesday but a very wise decision was to extend happy hour to every day! We've really made it a point to stop by on the weekends to partake in HH just cause it's such a good deal!! Overall, we've embraced \"our\" place and hope it succeeds. If you have an issue, please address it. Kelley and Skyler will always take great care of you!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by a warm smiling pig. After navigating through the novelty pig signs and Route 66 decor and having a ton of saw dust in my flip flops we were seated at a picnic like table. Waitress came and took our drink orders and answered my questions about the menu. Ended up with the baby back ribs with mac and cheese and \"horsey spuds\" mashed potatoes whipped with Horseradish. Food came very quickly and let me tell you about these ribs. My god. I'm not a huge rib aficionado but i know good ribs when the bones literally fall out of the meat. BBQ sauce is served on the side in a cast iron skillet. It was perfect. Good portions of food and good prices. The horsey spuds had the perfect bite and the mac and cheese was homemade. brought some ribs home for later and more sauce. Sides are never ending.   This Main St drag is home to many retirement communities and snow birds this time of the year, so once you've mowed over the walker and parked next to the electric scooter the food is amazing. Steer clear of the gift shop next door. Lots of gas station-esq novelty items that have been marked up ten times to appease the Canadian crowd. If you can get past the surrounding neighborhood the food is so so worth it.   BF had pulled pork sand which and it was perfect too. I like that the drinks come in mason jars too. Checked in via Yelp and received a free drink"}
{"text":"I have had catering from Waldo's twice now.  First, a whole pig roast and next brisket and ribs.  Great, great food.  Tender and delicious and I got all complements from my guests.  We will use them again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this new place and the hubs and I sat at the bar. They've kept a lot of the decor from the previous tenant, Harvey American, we found that odd immediately. Bartender was friendly and recommended the 3 meat sampler. Took her advice and got the pulled pork, brisket and a kind of spicy sausage. For our sides we got the green chili mac and sweet potato fries. The pork was way over cooked and mushy, brisket was very fatty and tough and the sausage was ok and not spicy. The sweet potato fries were the best part of the meal, hot and crispy but the mac and cheese was so over cooked, it was like baby food. We're truly not complainers but what a waste of money and I highly doubt that we'll return."}
{"text":"We  love Waldo's! It's walking distance for us to that makes it an easy choice for dinner after an afternoon happy hour and day at the pool.  We get the St. Louis ribs to share along with a potato and sauteed veggies (which are awesome). The sides are endless so you can get as many orders as you like and additional sides are just $2. You really can't beat the value. And the BBQ is pretty darn good! We really like the sauces (regular & jerk) too.  We've been coming here for years now and we haven't been disappointed yet! Ask for Brooke or Dave they are awesome servers and will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Waldo's is okay! The decor inside and out is cool. I like the relaxed atmosphere- and there's often a wait so that means the food is good! The pulled pork sandwich was good- comparable to many other BBQ places around. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Real sweet tea! Great food, all u can eat sides. Had pulled pork sandwich & sampler plate. Very good and tasty. Good for the wallet too."}
{"text":"I decided to try Waldo's for the first time tonight! I am definitely a bbq snob! I have two smokers in the back yard and consider myself a smoke/bbq novice at best but I love bbq and continue to hone my craft! The food I ordered tonight was outstanding! I had a sample platter of smoked Turkey, Pulled Pork, and Brisket! Included with the meat came some outstanding sides! I had the Potato wedges, Cole Slaw and jalapeño corn bread! First of all the meat was juicy, smoked to perfection and definitely bbq competition quality!  The original bbq sauce was fantastic! A small dip is all that was really needed because the meat was good on its own! The sides topped it off! Cole slaw top notch! Potato wedges were so good I couldn't stop eating them! Dipped in ranch! The jalapeño corn bread was so good I could of ate a whole pan! I moved to Az 5 years ago and this by far is the best bbq in the east valley!"}
{"text":"Waldo's has a casual, small-town Southern country feel to it. Goofy signs and pictures are posted on the walls, providing mild entertainment during lulls in conversation. Our server was very friendly and very eager to attend to us, always with a smile.  Apart from the unique environment, the food was quite good as well. I had the pulled pork sandwich (delicious, though a bit dry) on a warm bun with spicy fries (dusted with Cajun seasoning - spicy indeed, but not to an overpowering extent). One member of my party raved about the corn chowder, and two others ordered the riblet special to their great satisfaction. The Horsey Spuds (mashed potatoes with horseradish) were a tasty, unique spin on a classic. The margaritas were the perfect blend of sweet-and-sour and alcohol, and the pink lemonade served in a massive Mason jar was also delicious.  I would definitely recommend Waldo's to anyone looking for a great barbecue meal in a fun environment."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and got take out.  The restaurant is really fun inside.  We ordered the sampler which was huge.  The food was amazing!  Prices are reasonable too.  Will for sure be back to t his BBQ place!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner with family. The food was very good and loved the unlimited  sides. I can only give two stars to Waldo's because the service was terrible. Our waiter forgot about us so many times that we wanted to walk out. The only thing keeping me here was the smell of BBQ. The food was good but the very bad service will keep me from going back. Sorry Waldo train your staff better."}
{"text":"Omg this place was amazing. You had to eat the ribs with a fork because they fell right off the bone. Chicken was the same way and the beach cobbler was to die for.  So glad we stopped here before restarting our diets again"}
{"text":"We had the best time.  The weather was beautiful so we sat at the picnic table on the patio which ended up to be perfect.  We could enjoy the live music but still chat with each other.  The food was delicious.  Only complaint was that we were told they were bringing out cornbread which never came.  Not that the meal needed it but many were looking forward to it.  Will go back soon.  Sauce was delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"The food is good. We were greeted right away but when I asked for the booth that was right next to the table she was seating us at the girl said we only have one left. OK what does that tell me?! We sat at the table & then the very next couple coming in was seated at the booth...loads of tables. Not good customer service in my book. Other BBQ places nearby that give better service. Nothing free."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places i ever had. Loved all the signs, wood chips on the floor, drinks in mason jars and the BBQ sauce was to die for. Wasn't greasy at all. There was a male customer that was giving our waitress a very very hard time, just being very difficult and her attitude hanged at the end but I would have to. We will go back, it was very yummy."}
{"text":"I like my meat plain.  No sauce or cheese.  Minimum spices.  That being said, I loved Waldo's.  The pork sandwich was served naked!  I was so happy!  The pork was piled high on a soft roll, tender and flavorful to boot.  Just what I was hoping for.  Sauces were served on the side, but they were not necessary to enhance the flavor of thus shredded pork.  I also got a baked sweet potato as my side.  It was perfect served with brown sugar and butter.  I know that my family also enjoyed their spicier foods, so I am sure we will be coming here frequently."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble in for lunch on all you can eat rib day. I didn't make it any farther than that on the menu but if the rest of the many is anything like the ribs you are in for a treat. I am especially picky when it comes to BBQ in Az, but Waldo's is definitely worth a visit.  Oh and the staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"Walked in to Waldo's today and was seated. Waitress brought out the wrapped silverware and placed it on the table,  and a roach comes flying out of one of the wrapped utensils.... Not a good 1st impression."}
{"text":"Excellent food with Large portions and friendly staff get this joint 5stars.    Everytime we come to Mesa this is a must stop.    For 22 Years  the food has been consistently amazing."}
{"text":"My parents told me about their visit on Easter Sunday.  We loved Waldo's when it was opened at a different location near the San Tan Village mall years ago. This Easter, they wanted Some Burros (closed) so they tried In N Out (closed) and ended up at Waldo's. Now, my parents aren't too picky about what they eat. However, they were going on and on about how the beans were hard and tasteless (Bush's would've been better), the nacho meat and cheese was dried and flavorless (like it was old and sitting there for a while), and it was overpriced for the quantity they received (let alone the quality). They dropped almost $50 for food for three people. They were upset and after this experience, unlikely to return. This is unfortunate since we had such fond memories of Waldo's in the past."}
{"text":"Dry brisket with no smoke ring, pulled pork tastes boiled. The tater option is just meat and potato with butter and sour cream. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Skyler was our server and he provided great  service. Good food at reasonable prices. Our first time here and it won't be our last."}
{"text":"Amazing roadtrip pit stop for my kiddos and family! We loved our food and Scott was amazing! He made sure to check on us regularly and made our visit extraordinary.  The whole building was full of smiles and such a wonderful mood. We are from out of town, but everytime we are around, we make a point to swing into Waldos for some pork! Thank you Scott for your help, patience, and genuine people skills!!! See yall again soon!"}
{"text":"Lunch on Sunday. Not over crowded. Greeted at the door as we entered. Friendly attitude with a smile. Seated immediately. Waiter was right there with drinks and menu. Got the sampler plate which had a taste of most of the meats. Wonderful smoked flavor. Sauce is killer. Bought a pint to go. Ate my fill and took home enough for another meal. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fried okra was fresh hot and delicious, pulled pork, beef, and chicken were all served cold, so was sauce & beans. won't return."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and our server was amazingly nice and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm usually hesitant to try new bbq places but this place did not disappoint. We will definitely come back when we are in Mesa again."}
{"text":"This food doesn't get any better. For real southern BBQ come to Waldo's and I promise you will not be disappointed! The restaurant is always clean and service is always amazing. You get delicious cornbread for each person when they seat you and it is YUMMY!We have been coming here for years and we will always be back!"}
{"text":"We went back today and took both DH and DS.  DH and I both used the coupon on the website for the country ribs and pulled pork, DS took the safe route and ordered a sampler again.    I decided to order a tossed as a side - and was I impressed.  We went somewhere earlier in the week and ordered wings and a side salad - and at $4,it had nothing more than some iceberg, croutons, and dressing.  This was a nice salad - thick diagonal slices of cukes, grape tomatoes, croutons and spring mix tossed with the iceberg.  And large.  Between the cornbread and the salad, I was about done in.  DH got the cowboy beans.  They were real pintos cooked with chili powder and maybe a little ground meat.  Tasty if you are not the canned pork and beans crowd - but they wouldn't appreciate homemade beans anyway :)  He also had the spiced fries - I haven't figured those out yet.  Not blackened, not chili - just a little itsy bitsy bit of spice on them.  Tasty but I just can't figure out what they had on them.  But they were neither overly-salted or overly-spiced.  Country ribs were plentiful and moist but they should be a fattier cut of pork (and they were). DH also ordered a hot link on the side - now that was a tasty morsel!  It was a sneaky link:  chew it, chew it, swallow it - now feel the burn.  Definitely worth getting again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!  I love the pulled pork sandwich and the pulled pork baked potato. They also have pretty good complimentary corn bread! You can order 1 or more pounds of pulled pork or beef to-go and it comes with container of sauce.  It's really nice for dinners at home."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars for service only, and the onion rings, but the BBQ was not good, the brisket was very dry as it cooled down, the meat was not smoked correctly, it tasted like they used liquid smoke, not a good flavor. The sauces were good, and the rub was good."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ restaurant located near our house.  Used to drive all the way to their Mesa location but now it's close by! We've had Skyler twice as a server and he is very helpful and attentive.  Quick service and great tasting food! The BBQ sauce in the skillet is amazing! Sweet and tasty.  The portion sizes are large.  We will be calling in a catering order for a birthday party next month.  Try their pulled pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful rack of baby back ribs - HUGE with Waldo's terrific original sauce - a sweet potato complete with butter & cinnamon and. Cornbread with honey.  Yum!  Our Server was Scott who rounded out our dinner with welcoming friendly and informative service!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Love this place!!!!! We got many different things and it was delicious. Good service too. Go here and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Been here twice this summer (so far).  Although the place looks a bit dumpy inside and out the food is actually decent. Their BBQ sauce is well above average, somewhat similar to Sweet Baby Ray's IMO, slightly spicier.  I get their pulled pork to-go which comes with a container of bbq sauce, and you can buy pints to go in Ball canning jars.   Service has always been nice. The inside of the place is covered with joke signs and cowboy art. It looks worn and dumpy but it appears basically clean.   Their clientele looks a bit worn too, which is why I always get carry-out. I don't drink so I have no idea what their drinks and beer prices are like.  If you are looking for well above average pulled pork BBQ I highly recommend giving Waldo's a try. I would recommend going here if for no other reason than to buy a jar of their BBQ sauce to go. It needs to be refrigerated at home.  If I could rate the place by different categories I would rate the food and service a 4.5 and the building/parking a 1 star."}
{"text":"Maybe I came in on an off day. I've heard such good things about this place, after all, so I decided to check it out.  The food itself wasn't bad. It was alright, but certainly nothing special that I could see. Not impressive. Staff...eh? Not rude, but not happy. The 2 I interacted with seemed...indifferent. You can hold it against me if you want, but I like a cheery, smiling waiter! Oh well, at least they were polite.  All in all, I doubt I'll return. It was just too bland of an experience for me. Maybe if I'm super hungry and there's nothing better available."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Been coming here for years. The ribs fall off the bone and melt in your mouth and topped with jerk sauce it doesn't get better."}
{"text":"Had a half slab of ribs, and it was really good and there was plenty of it.  The side items were good and larger than I expected.   The order was filled reasonably quickly.      The order staff seemed very confused.   It took three times and a credit card refund to get it right.   But they got there eventually.  My current favorite ribs place."}
{"text":"Holy crap. @-@  This place is the bomb of all BBQ places.  Kick butt. Ribs. Plus the signature BBQ sauce.  Food heaven is real. And it's here at this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. Doesn't look like much from outside, but a for sure going back"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst barbecue we ever had. The food was really bland and the building smelled like mildew. The service was good though."}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about the atmosphere here that much. The parking lot smells like sewage. It's crowded and loud inside especially on the busy nights. But I always go back there for the food. By far the best BBQ in the east valley. I love the refills on side dishes you get with the meal. Great price!"}
{"text":"My only issue is deciding what I like best. They have real honest sweet tea. The meats are smoked and you add the sauces. I love the hot spicy BBQ in moderation."}
{"text":"The St. Louis ribs are cooked to perfection and literally fall off the bone. The potato salad is top notch and service was great. This just became my new favorite bbq joint."}
{"text":"The pork burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had, especially with all of the BBQ sauce at my disposal. Service was awesome, too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stinks when they sit you in the back near the bathrooms. Sat near a couple that was getting up and coming to our table to view the memorabilia on the walls. It was very rude and we left early due to being uncomfortable."}
{"text":"First time here.  It's laid back, loud, and family oriented. So family oriented lil kiddies are screaming and shrieking so audibly you can hear it across the large dining room.  We ordered Super Sampler. It comes with 2 sides. They're priced well. The chicken was dry, however.  We also ordered cookie with ice cream. We requested the cookie well done. It came to us gooey. Not what we ordered.  Service was a lil slow. Our server only checked with us 2x, and we had to flag her a couple of times.  Overall, the food was good. We will be returning again but at a different time."}
{"text":"We enjoy looking for the hole in the wall places to eat. More often than not the food is awesome. We decided on this place because the family was craving bbq and it stood out from the others because of the name. We live in Waldo. So we said why not. We ate the hay stacks for appetizers. They were not bad. Greasy, but fresh. We all got different types of meals. We got the tenesse samplers. 1/3rd lb skillet (beef) which was really good. We also ordered a full rack st. Louis style ribs, and my boys got ham sandwich and ribblets. There is so much food...we ended up taking half of it home. We loved that they give you corn bread while you are waiting. For desert we each got the mason jar cheese cake. I totally recommend this place to eat. Once i move hear, i will be eating here more often."}
{"text":"Pros: pulled pork, barbeque sauce, wood chips, service (Dave was great), paper table covers, sauteed veggies, sweet potato fries  Cons (all were only minorly disappointing): watery lemonade, dry cornbread, no baked beans, sandwich buns, mac and cheese okay.   Overall, would recommend. Not quite as good as billed"}
{"text":"We live close but don't partake too often because its a bit pricey for us but when we do its always YUMMY. We've noticed that the portions are smaller this time around though."}
{"text":"If you are a minority, I would seriously consider being accompanied by someone who is white because you could literally get shot in here. The ambience of Waldo's makes the inside of Famous Dave's restaurant look like a wine bar in the Castro district of San Francisco.  They are not subtle with describing their politics and their disdain of vegetarians, Sadaam Hussein and any pansy who doesn't enjoy red meat. Nonetheless, the place has character and it's a nice change from the chain restaurants that so annoyingly persists in Phoenix. The nice thing about Waldo's is it's sincere, you know where they stand, you know this restaurant has been around forever and you know what kind of food you will receive.  With regard to the food, America doesn't realize there are two types of BBQ restaurants. You have the fine upscale(fine for BBQ restaurants anyway) famous BBQ places like Rendezvous in Memphis or Gates in Kansas City.  But what most people are unaware of is there are a lot of BBQ pits or holes in the walls that serve their own style of cheap greasy BBQ and Waldo's is one of these places. You are not going to get the finest cuts of meat here. The BBQ is also not cooked to perfection for hours in a pit.  The food is greasy, fatty and somewhat tasteless. The sides are intriguing but are hit or miss. I ordered fried okra which was crispy and tasty and when I got a refill, it was soggy and cold...go figure...this is Waldos  Bottomline, don't take this place seriously and you will enjoy it. This is a lunch type of place. The food is expensive and overpriced. I just ate at Famous Daves and not only is the quality better at Daves but it's actually cheaper than Waldos.   The ambience is typical of a BBQ hole. The place smells like smoke, the AC is turned down to save money so it's a little warm but still comfortable. There are flies buzzing all over the place. I had this fly keep attacking my cornbread so I let him have it.  The waitresses are always a little rude and tough. They have no time for small talk but they are attentive in their own way, think women wrestingling or WNBA player and that describes the charm of their waitresses: tough, unabasehd yet attentive and hard working at the same time.  Their drinks are a really turn-on. They have lots of different flavored teas that are served in old jelly jars (very common in the South). The drinks are a real plus.  Nonetheless, I am strangely drawn to Waldos and would come back here again although I know the BBQ isn't great. I think it's the overall charm that draws you to this place because you really feel like you are dining in this old barn in the South.  Still, if this place was located in Oklahoma, Georgia, Texas etc. it would go out of business because this is a cheap imitation of those places but is kept alive by the fact that Phoenix lacks good BBQ"}
{"text":"I only give 3 stars just because of the service and the place look cool. The food other wise it was the worst BBQ and $48 +$11 tip I ever spend. My food was cold( don't bother to serve it on the cast iron skillet if there is no intention to heat the meat). My boyfriend sent his back so they can warm it up. But I didn't complain. The BBQ ribs taste old. Just because the meat fell off the bone doesn't mean is was good. The Texas hot links??? You call that hot links when it taste like sausage. My so called hot links has that gray color in the middle all the way through it! The only thing that temperature hot wise is the generic jalapeño mac and cheese. The fried corn on the cob was super greasy. I have to dap it with napkin before I can eat! The bottom of the bowl filled with oil.  Now we know never to ever ever ever ever go back and waste our money there ever again.  Just like one of the signs in the restaurant said \"if we don't meet your expectations maybe you should lower your standard\" just keep my mouth shut. Pay the ticket and never go back!!! I wrote this after I already went to the bathroom and for not eating anything all day I was super hungry. Normally you will eat anything and it will taste amazing but this time, hell no!! I finished the water. Never mind. I'm taking away 2 stars cause I'm still hungry and I had to go potty"}
{"text":"What's there not to like about Waldo's barbecue the food is amazing they do not smother your food in their wonderful sauces everything is served on the side the bartenders are amazing the staff is amazing everybody is friendly and easy to approach I love taking my family to Waldo's to be able to eat and enjoy the atmosphere! Also the outside patio is absolutely beautiful cannot wait for it to get a little bit cooler out so I can enjoy it live music on Thursdays is amazing trivia on Tuesday I absolutely love this new place in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Today I was out to lunch with my friend who is a iraq disabled veteran and our experience was not the best. I have been here several times and loved it however this time was different. The staff was very rude, my friend suffers from a head injury and sometimes takes a bit to process things. He is also from the midwest and is overly nice. But when his order came out wrong he was kind enough to mention it no issue we were very poilet and the waitress admitted fault. However the staff was being loud and rude about the situation. He ordered a thigh i was sitting right next to him. They gave him a leg he asked to switch it out no biggie. The whole staff made joked and rude comments about the switch out. Even wrote on the itemized reciept \"breats and +leg!!!\" Also when he asked for a refill on a side which we were unaware they changed some things on the menu. The other waitress was making a fuss and was overly loud saying \"wow, what a tough conversation to have.\" \"Ouch what a stab to the heart! He must of took that real hard!\" I knew what was going on but did not want to get my friend fired up as we continued our lunch. We were very polite, I even let him leave a tip considering I didn't want him to get upset after taking a picture of the receipt.. I myself manage a upscale gourmet restraunt. I would never treat my customers this way, and if you're going to make fun of your customers please move to the back of the house. I shouldn't have to explain a disability to a staff to do their jobs to be treated like any other customer..."}
{"text":"We went here recently as I have read the great reviews. They were NOT kidding! We started out with a haystack of onion rings. (I saw a picture and needed to try them) These onion rings were HUGE! The picture did not do it justice- we ended up taking most of them home.)  I ordered a pulled pork sandwhich and hubby ordered a 3 meat sampler. All of it delicious! BBQ sauce on the side, which was nice. Huge mason jars for drinks, which was great for us, and probably for the servers as well. Highly recommend this place- food came out fast (probably due to it being BBQ and precooked? but isn't that what BBQ is?) Refills on sides, even though we didn't get any since we were stuffed by the onion rings and meals, but nice to know we could have gotten more. A plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ place!  Love their pulled pork skillet with 2 sides, along with their large-sized sweet tea in canning jars.  Funny & eclectic wall/ceiling placards & decor."}
{"text":"OOOMMMGGG!  So Yummylious!  We ordered the Super Sampler! For dessert Peach Cobbler.  Bottomless Coke and Arnold Palmer.  Skyler took care of us and a room full of others!"}
{"text":"For great bbq and wide selection of beer this place is great. Really nice patio and bar."}
{"text":"We've decided that when the girls are on Summer Break from school, we're going to come here once a week on a Mon-Weds, since kids eat free on those days.  When you find a restaurant that you all love, it's like hitting the jackpot!!!"}
{"text":"Our AZ friends took us here for dinner.  Had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries.  Excellent!  And it was Wine Wednesday so all wines were only $3 a glass.  I guess it's a running joke among locals that the little souvenir shop next door is never open.  Since the restaurant was packed, I'm sure they could expand next door and still have a full house."}
{"text":"Great bbq! I was just thinking about how I wish I could go get some good bbq and immediately went back to thinking of this place. Unfortunately I am 1,000 miles away and I can't remember a darned thing that I had (it's been over a year ago) but I know it was good. Here's to hoping I'm back in Mesa soon!"}
{"text":"Great baby backs, sides, bartender is good on the pour, brisket is delicious too! Great location ."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would.  Fantastic service.  Everyone who works there obviously has pride in the place.  It's like they all have a stake in the claim.  Great atmosphere.  Food DELISH.  I normally get 1/3 lb pulled pork with a bun and inhale that stuff.  It's a manly meal in a manly restaurant.  I ate here and the next thing you know, I have to shave twice a day, my wife got pregnant and people started paying me the money they owed me.  Coincidence?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"My wife and stopped in after drving by on our way back to east Mesa from A.J. We were pleasantly surprised. I had the three meat combo, my wife had the two. Hot and delicious and reasonably priced. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is a great place for BBQ! The potato wedges are a must try. We had the best witress Kylie, please ask for her. She gave us options that we didn't know about. Hard worker too! We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff   Decor is very relaxed and low key. Love the functionality of the white butcher paper on the tables   The jalapeño cornbread was very bland, pale and dry.  In comparison the house salad was super fresh with large chunks of cucumber and baby tomato   Generous servings.    The BBQ has a distinctive Smokey taste which was not overwhelming   The sauce appears to be tomato based with a hint of vinegar   Not to bad   The coleslaw was good. The creamy base did not swamp the slaw. A lot of slaws make me feel like I am eating a \"slaw soup\".  The cabbage has crunch in it.   The potato mash with horseradish scared me off until I tasted it. The horseradish is there but does not over power the mashed potato  Peach cobbler was a big disappointment.  Very sweet no peach  flavor.  It was listed as \"award winning\". Would not recommend it"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in the area and they threw this place out as a good place in town. I was able to try turkey, chicken, and pork, and they were all delicious. I got nachos with turkey and they were amazing, the only thing I would have changed was to have 5x as much pico de gallo.   The server was nice and I observed others going above and beyond, but ours disappeared when we were ready for the bill and some in the party were pretty antsy by the time it came."}
{"text":"This place is a unique adventure. The whole place has a very run down look, with lots of really cool old timey advertisements and jokes about the quality of the food and the restaurant. The food itself is no joke though! Everything I've had has been amazing, the fried corn especially. Everything gets served to you in miniature cast iron pans and tastes amazing. Any place that serves you your drink in a mason jar means serious business."}
{"text":"In the cutest little old fashioned looking strip mall, the vibe of this place is just perfectly old school, retro American. As a Canadian I love finding places that are really special and unique.   We sat at a cozy booth in the corner, we were served so quickly, servers were all on the ball.  My fiancé and I ordered the plate that had 4 different meats and 2 sides. It says it serves 1 but we shared it and were full!   We ordered the ribs, pulled pork, pulled beef and brisket. The green chilli Mac and cheese has a hint of spice which really added depth to it. We also had the beans - good, typical beans! Oh ya, and cornbread on the side - a must have. $20 for all that food!   It was all so delicious I would absolutely go back again.   The next few days we went to Bobby Q's to compare the rival. Although Bobby Q's was also very good, my fiancé and I said Waldo's won due to price, sauce flavour and overall ambiance."}
{"text":"I came to Arizona to sample the bbq and Waldo's is the first place I visited.  Smoky scent of mesquite wood filled the parking lot.  Tractor, smoker in the parking lot and neon signs gave this place a rustic ambiance .  Inside were many cool looking items.  Menu was huge so I tried the super sampler to get a good variety of meats.  Baby back ribs were tender and full of smoky flavor.  I enjoyed them a lot.  I added some bbq sauce and the sweet tangy sauce gave the ribs additional moisture and flavors.  Turkey was full of smoky flavor.  Brisket was tender and had mild smoky flavor.  Pulled pork was very tender and had mild smoky flavor.  I like Waldo's Bbq.  I'm a big fan of dry rubbed meats smoked in mesquite.  Reminds me of my fav bbq joints in San Diego."}
{"text":"These were the best ribs that I have ever had. My dad, wife, and I were looking for a good place to eat ribs tonight and we found Waldo's on Yelp.  We were going to eat at home but we were unable to do so because some of our family we're not feeling well. We were very fortunate to find Waldos restaurant and even more fortunate to have Scott as our waiter. Scott knew just how much we should order and he was a great help to us with side recommendations.  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Waldo's is our family's go to destination for consistently awesome barbeque.  Melt in your mouth ribs every time!"}
{"text":"Ordered Super Sampler for dinner which included pulled pork, 1/4 rack baby back ribs, sliced brisket and turkey with a side of boiled corn on the cob and a baked potato with bacon and cheddar cheese.   Brisket: just okay, meat was lean but no flavor.  Ribs: good flavor but overcooked. Meat fell off bones before I could eat it. Pulled pork: a little too much fat and watered down but overall nice flavor.  Turkey: dark meat which wasn't mentioned, good flavor and moisture  Fully loaded baked potato: great! No complaints here! Cornbread: average at best, nothing special. Green chiles were a nice surprise  Corn on the cob: absolutely terrible. Might be the worst corn I've had in my life. Bad taste - seemed like it was overcooked because it was too soggy.   In summary: not the worst, but won't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Friday night with our 2 small kids. We got there about 630 and were seated right away before the dinner rush. Our server was nice and made some great suggestions that would work for our little family.  We ended up getting the Super Sampler which is a tray of 3 meats of your choice, a big bowl of bbq sauce and 2 sides. All the sides here are ENDLESS! So if you get macaroni and mashed potatoes, you can have as many bowls as you want throughout your dinner! I though that was awesome and great for families!!  I also got a pina colada, they were on special for 3 dollars. I wasn't expecting it to be so tasty!  When we were leaving our waitress let us know that kids eat free monday-thursday!!   It's a really great place for families, because the atmosphere is loud and fun, so no need to keep hushing your kids. Also good for couples looking for a fun night out. There is also a great little gift shop next door, but they close at 6.   We will, no doubt, be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I have went to Waldos twice qwith my family.  The first time was a very good experience and the second time was not so pleasant.  The first time we had good food and good service.  The second time the food was good but the service from the waitress was not so great.  The second time we went the A/C was also broken and it felt hotter in the restraunt than it wa outside at 110f.  By the time we got done eating we were covered in sweat.  My advice is call and make sure the A/C is fixed before going and only go for the food.  If you are gonig for good service try somewhere else.  FOOD 5 Star for the money and value Service-  3 Star, it could be improved a lot.  Depends who your server is too."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new place tonight. We love a good local restaurant so we found Waldo's on yelp, the reviews were great so we thought we would give it a shot. We ordered haystacks (onion rings) that were the best we have ever had! They were light and crispy and served with ranch and bbq sauce. The house bbq sauce is great, super Smokey and not to tangy has the right amount of sugar!. We shared a sampler for dinner, we ordered the chicken, brisket as well as the pulled pork, we picked mashed potatoes with horseradish and potato salad for our sides. The pulled pork was super tender and had a great smoked flavor, unfortunately the chicken and brisket were super dry. The sides were \"ok\" nothing special. I'm not sure if I will return again."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ....fun staff.  Definitely try the fried corn on the cob.  I visit whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had a lot to eat including creamed corn (soooo good), and a pina colada (served in a mason jar). The food is presented fantastically, and the service is AMAZING! Such nice, attentive people. I went to the manager and commented on how fantastic my waiter was."}
{"text":"The food was good but the portions is over priced. They catered at my job going through FOODA. I got the platter which was like two bits of chicken and pulled pork and 3 slices for brisket with a half side of beans for $11.95. I won't be getting food from there again. The food trucks that come to the site have better portions for your money."}
{"text":"Love love love the BBQ sauce.  Some of the best BBQ you can get in AZ.  I was not a big fan of some of the sides (sorry no 5 star) but the meat was very very good with generous portion served hot.."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for yearsbecause it's far from where we love . We went to lunchthis week and the food was Great.  Big portions great service. We will be making the drive to go here more often"}
{"text":"Items Ordered:  Three Meat Combo with Rib Tips, Turkey, and Hot Links; Fried Catfish  Total Bill:  Under $35  Quick Tips:   - Add jalapeno mac & cheese to your order   We went for a late lunch on a Monday so it was almost empty inside.  We sat for a while deciding what we wanted and this seemed to terribly annoy our waitress.   When our food arrived the three meat combo was wrong.  It included pulled beef (what is that) instead of hot links.  The waitress admitted it was her error and quickly brought out the missing hot links.  The meats were lackluster.  Everything was chopped up and chopping up meats just dries it out, which it was, especially the turkey.  Turkey is never good dry and it was almost like jerky on the outside cause it had been smoked so much.   The catfish, sided with fried okra and jalapeno mac & cheese were spot on and very tastey!  The fish was crisp and really ended up being the star of the meal for us.  So if you are going for great BBQ, don't.  But if you want some really good fried foods, they have you covered."}
{"text":"Excellent service as well as fantastic BBQ!  We go there at least once a week when we are in Apache Junction and area!!!"}
{"text":"We were hesitant to stop here because of the poor reviews, but curiosity and a desire for BBQ took over. If I didn't include the lack of staff, only 2 waiters for the whole restaurant, it would be 4 stars. Unfortunately there was only 2 and they seemed to do the best they could, but it was a busy night before Thanksgiving. We did enjoy the food and will come back to try it again...  and hope the service is much faster.   Update: we came back a second time. The service was better but the service was just okay. My husband said the burger was just okay. My ham was good but it was lacking something as a sandwich.   Side note: why don't they bring options for BBQ sauce?? We had to ask if they had options, then they only brought a tiny cup of the other two sauces. Also....I wish they'd ask which sauce you want instead of choosing to give you only the standard sauce."}
{"text":"Was in Waldo's over the weekend with my girlfriend and her parents. The onion rings were amazing, the brisket was tender, the pulled pork was pulled and the turkey was chopped. BBQ sauce is flavorful and the sides were quite good. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ as always.  Also as always the corn bread was disappointing. It was under cooked and tasteless.   New to report. The mens room was dirty and in a state of disrepair.  The sink faucet is no longer attached to the sink but hangs on by the attachment to the water pipes."}
{"text":"Waldo's what did you do? This was my favorite BBQ. Not anymore, pulled pork not very good, greasy and had a weird taste. Same thing with the sauce. You get the award for the most soggy, gross French fries in Mesa. The mush on the cob was the last straw. The one star was for the service. Doubt if I will ever come back, Yuk."}
{"text":"i love the food its all delicious, i have no complaints about that. every time i come i'm welcomed with kindness by both young ladies that host upfront. there is one gentleman that always gives an attitude for some reason and its every time i go. over all the food is great!!"}
{"text":"This BBQ restaurant is delicious. I have been to this restaurant at least half a dozen times. Every time I have eaten here the food has been great. I have sampled nearly everything on the menu,the brisket is very tender with little amount of fat, pulled pork juicy, hot link has the perfect amount of spices, not overly spicy but definitely not bland either. Service has been fast and the servers are attentive. The draft beer selection is amazing. Lots of local brews along with most of your favorite domestics. They have live music Thursday through Saturday nights, so if you are looking for a place to kick back and enjoy some music and great food and drinks, you need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"By far the best bbq I've had in Phoenix so far.  Yes, I've been to Honey BBQ, Famous Daves, Stacy's (unfortunately not in the running.. sniff!), Dickie's BBQ Pit, etc.  So the pulled pork by itself is eh, and the bbq sauce is like eh, but then you put them together and its AWESOME!  It makes you scratch your head..  The bun is very tasty and goes with the pork well too.  The corn bread is on the dry side with bits of corn in it.  Not bad.  The BBQ nachos I would not recommend although you do get a heaping pile of tasty bits.  Also would not recommend the spicy fries, but I hear their mac and cheese and various other sides are better.  But I'm definitely going back to find that perfect endless side to go with my pulled pork sandwich.  Maybe get a rack on the side too!  ;)"}
{"text":"I'm from eastern North Carolina and I know good barbecue when I have it... And know bad barbecue too.  I was frankly AMAZED when we found this BBQ joint.  H U G E portions G R E A T food F U N atmosphere  Cannot wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"First time to this location and we really enjoyed it.  Kylie was our server and she was outstanding.  She answered all our questions and knew everything on the menu and took great care of us.  The ribs here are AMAZING, they melt in your mouth.  They come with their dry rub which is delicious and their jerk BBQ sauce was pretty amazing too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and the sauce is good, if a bit sweet for me. Good prices for the quality and amount of food you get and the service was good. Started off with the haystack, it's like onion rings just crunchier, they were really good with the barbecue sauce. I tried three different meats along with the green chili Mac n cheese and fried okra, all were excellent and I had plenty of food to take home."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for BBQ, and the prices are most reasonable. The premises are, well, funky. Part of the uniqueness is by design and the other part is just letting it all go. I have been living/visiting in Mesa for 50 years and did not know it was even here but had driven by 1,000 times.   I had ribs with 2 sides and I loved the choices. The food is really good and portions are most generous. I shall return."}
{"text":"Blah Bbq. House Cab was undrinkable. Corn bread so stale we could not eat. Patio and location were very nice. Too bad about the food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We've only been here once (a couple of months ago) but it was sooooo good and we are looking forward to our next trip!! I think I had the brisket burger. I don't remember the name but it was a burger with brisket and bbq sauce on it and it was amazing!!! Even the fries and coleslaw were fantastic and I don't even like coleslaw!. The service was top notch, too. They were slammed and clearly not used to such a big crowd on a Saturday afternoon. But they stepped up, served everyone fast and correctly, stayed helpful and friendly and joked with the customers. The staff was truly a pleasure!!"}
{"text":"had the bbq brisket sandwich (regular). very filling.  This is my father in laws go to place for BBQ. For starters they bring out a what tasted like green chili's or jalapeño corn bread and their iced tea (sweet or unsweetened) were served in a mason jar. (loved it) I ordered the regular size brisket with hefty sweet potato fries.  The BBQ sauce was served on the side, family style,  in a small iron skillet, so you can contol the amount of sauce you want. I initially drizzled mine as I wanted to taste the brisket and after my first bite...wowza, I doused it with BBQ. it was good.  The brisket was all meat, unlike some establishments,  they give you slices of fat! not this place...  The rest of the family ate the traditional pulled pork.  oh also, you can top any samiches with coleslaw.    only knock I have is the side of coleslaw is a small portion....other than that, I would round up your posse and eat you up some porky P-I-G"}
{"text":"We ordered two sandwiches - one large, one regular and we could not tell a difference in size when they arrived at our table.  If I wanted cooked with with BBQ sauce thrown on top, I would have ate at home.  Whatever happened to cooking the meat IN THE SAUCE??  The smoked flavor of the meat was so overwhelming, I could not taste the sauce."}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever had in my life! They are fall-off-the-bone and sooo tasty!! Skyler has been our server several times...love that kid! I tried the Sampler tonight, and I couldn't even finish it all."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ every time I have come in. When I am in town seeing family this is always a must stop place for me. Sauces are good. I like my BBQ spicy and this place has a spicy sauce which is good. Always plenty of food too!"}
{"text":"Get the super sampler and you can try three meats plus 1/4 rack of ribs. Their house made BBQ sauce for all their meats is perfectly balance.  A bit of a bite without being hot. We got beef brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken and of course, the ribs.  Pulled pork: juicy and flavorful- our favorite of all four meats.  Pulled chicken: I'm not usually a chicken fan--but this chicken is fresh and flavorful.  Nummy. Brisket: was cold.  Couldn't really enjoy it much. Ribs: Smoked, not covered in sugar or sauce.  If you want sauce, just use the bowl (yes bowl) of sauce they bring to your table. Cornbread: just like Momma used to make. Not too sweet with a browned bottom. Peach cobbler.  What can you say--is there such a thing as bad peach cobbler? Not too sweet, and soggy pie shell. Mmmmm. Con: None of our food arrived hot--all lukewarm--except the corn on the cob. I'm guessing it was sitting there as the corn was being boiled. Next time I'm not ordering the corn and hopefully everything comes to the table hot.   Ambience: smart-ass signage / old farmhouse.  Wood shavings on the floor.  If you're  looking for upscale, look elsewhere.  If your looking for Uber-casual, this fits the bill.  We will be back-- they open at 5am for breakfast. Two eggs, sausage and toast is $3.25.  Worth a shot."}
{"text":"What an amazing little gem in the east valley!!! I bring out of towners here every time! The food is amazing from the complimentary cornbread to the BBQ dishes, sides and peach cobbler (THE best)! They also have blacked catfish for the mindful and health conscious- and it's packed with flavor! The service is also second to none! Scott knows the menu well and the history of this amazing local owned establishment! It was a pleasure all around dining here and we will definitely continue to come here for the best BBQ in town!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first visit to the new Waldo's in Gilbert. The baked potato with pulled pork was delicious and my husband enjoyed a sampler of different BBQ meats. Nice to go during happy hour. Our server, Kelli, did a great job. We will go back again."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not a fan of BBQ. This is literally the first time I've gone to a BBQ joint, enjoyed it, and said I would go back. The meats were tender and not overly smoked. There was a light, smokey flavor that was perfectly complemented by their house BBQ. Between us, we tried every meat, salmon, and 2 different ribs. The portions were very generous for the fair pricing. The only dish that looked like it was lacking was the sampler -It was small. It would have been fine for me but my husband probably could have eaten 2. The sides were fine- nothing special but who cares when the meat is on point. Service was friendly and decent. Definitely will be going back here."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ with nice side choices reasonably priced. Our server Scott was polite and very friendly and helpful with the menu. I had the Super Sampler that had 3 types of BBQ meat, I chose pork ribs, pulled chicken, and brisket. For the side dishes I chose a bowl of pinto beans with potato wedges, the sides are all you can eat if you want. We ordered a warm Peach cobbler with a scoop of ice creem for the kids which we all shared. I definitely will be coming back soon. : )"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a BBQ fan but when I have the craving this is definitely the place that hits the spot! I enjoy their $8 regular sandwiches with an unlimited side. YES- UNLIMITED side! I normally like the mac and cheese or sweet potato fries but there is a lot to choose from. The decor is great with witty signs and the choice of a huge booth or longer tables. They work great with big groups and the service is always wonderful. Make sure to get a punch card!"}
{"text":"First, we love the restaurant in Mesa and the food is always delicious. We wanted to try their new location in Gilbert and was extremely disappointed. Our takeout order consisted of a pound of turkey, pound of brisket and some sides. When we arrived home I noticed the turkey was almost all dark meat and not what I was expecting. No mention of white/dark meat on the menu or when ordering. Since no one in the family likes dark meat it was a waste. The brisket was so dry that it was hard to chew and not tender at all. The sides were good but the meat was terrible disappointment and I cannot recommend eating either the turkey or brisket at this location. We live in Gilbert so really wanted this to be good :("}
{"text":"Ordered the super sampler plate which was good but the sliced brisket was marbled with fat and hard to chew. The other meats were very good. The service was friendly. Next time no brisket for me!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite BBQ place. My family would all meet up to eat here every few weeks and we thoroughly enjoyed doing so, but the last two times we've gotten the same server who is a total killjoy. She completely ruins the experience for us. She says she is management, which makes me wonder what the owners of Waldo's are thinking. The last time we dined at Waldo's she accused my boyfriend (who is vegan) of sharing meals and wouldn't give our table any of the unlimited sides.  He came to drink an Iced Tea and enjoy the conversation, because clearly he can't share a meal that is chock full of meat. Even the beans have meat. C'mon. After we explained the situation, she proceeded to spend the next 5 minutes arguing with us, until the 6 of us decided to get to go boxes so we didn't have to deal with her anymore. She then tried to come back and explain that it wasn't her fault, but the owners policy and there were servers there who never follow those orders and we should fill out a comment card so they should be dealt with. (What?) We came to eat, not try to get others in trouble for not following the rules.   Besides that, she has a really bad attitude and acts like she hates her job, which is too bad because most of the other servers here are awesome.  It's safe to say we won't ever be dining here again, which I guess makes room for more enjoyable BBQ restaurants. Sorry Waldo's, worst experience I've ever had at a dining establishment."}
{"text":"Food is great. Customer service lousy. Told Two separate people that took our order, to add BBQ sauce. Get all the at home You guessed it NO BBQ sauce. Called back to let them know. Got a Rude Woman on phone. Fast service 5 Stars..Food 5 Stars. Service people only hear what they want to hear 1 Star. And I'm being nice."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Waldo's Mesa location for several years now something has obviously changed in the last year - and it's not for the better.  The ribs have always been very good but the baby back ribs we had on Sunday were like eating shoe leather.  We had 2 full racks and they were both terrible - no flavor, they seriously looks like an old shoe.  We asked the waitress to replace one rack and she refused.  We then asked for an adjustment to the bill and she again said she would not accommodate us but she would comp us a $3 desert.  I suspect her manager has directed the wait staff to refuse food replacement or price adjustments.  Either way it's piss poor service and food.  After this episode we will never return and would recommend others visit Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert.  Their BBQ is far superior and the wait staff is competent."}
{"text":"We wanted to love it, but were underwhelmed. The brisket was dry and overcooked. Chicken wasn't terrible but we were given all dark meat. Fries were good though. We'll probably give them another chance to see if it was a fluke."}
{"text":"Good food, small portions, fries were a little too salty. Great customer service. Good pricing. Bring back unlimited corn on cob deep fried"}
{"text":"I don't know why but  I have some pretty good memories of Arizona BBQ throughout my life. My grandparents have lived in Mesa for the last 16 years and Joe's BBQ has always been a must go to...but recently my grandparents have been taking us to Waldo's because it is closer to their house.  I love the funky piggy themed decorations. I also really find Waldo's to be a perfect option because in contrast to Joes A.) They have never ending sides (including baked sweet potatoes) which I could eat for days on end anyways and B.) They serve their meat in tiny skillets (which is flipping adorable.) I love that they bring their sweet bbq sauce on the side because then it allows me to have the option of putting as little or as much as I want on top. Unfortunately for me their cornbread was awesome and one bite put me down the rabbit hole of eating an entire piece. Love Love"}
{"text":"Very rude waitress who told a 65 year old woman on a 112 degree day that she couldn't bring her bottle of water into the restaurant and insisted that she put it in her purse! Are you kidding me? So we ordered water to drink. Sorry chick-a -dee, but your rude attempt to get us to buy a drink and run up the tab for a bigger self-absorbed tip was a total failure. (I was dying for a soda.) We won't be back! I like to order the turkey but it is usually very dry and difficult to choke down, so I asked the waitress about it on this particular day and her NASTY-toned reply was, \"I have no idea!\"  Everytime she spoke to us there was distain in her voice.   Prices are up, portions are down, attitude is up, and say bye-bye to unlimited sides now. Food is just so-so. There are so many wonderful BBQ joints in town now, there is no real good reason to patronize a place where the employees attitudes leave a worse taste in your mouth than even the mediocre food does. We will be crossing this one off the Thursday night group eat-out list!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! Great place for dinner!  Definitely our favorite place for bar-b-que!"}
{"text":"Solid four stars... food is great, and portions are good. I tried their fried okra and their sweet potato chips as sides and they were both very tasty. My boyfriend's mac anc cheese was not so good though, was a little lukewarm and the cheese was not cheesy nor did it have any flavor. Service is good, although I do wish they could just bring out tons of their bbq sauce all at once instead of serving it to us in a tiny little pan over and over again. Overall I'm a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"We love eating at Waldos BBQ.  Amazing food and great service! the St Louis ribs are to die for, the hot links are great.  Try the grilled veggies, they are outstanding with great seasoning.  Never a bad meal!"}
{"text":"The place does not look like much, but if you came for great food, you are in the right place! Two big pieces of Catfish, Potatoe wedges, Corn of the cob, Corn bread.  Three of us ate darn good for less than forty buck!  If you are in the area, don't pass Waaldo's by.  You don't know what you are missing.  Outstanding food, Great service!  Thanks for doing it right."}
{"text":"Good \"hole in the wall\" place for BBQ. This is a popular place in Mesa and we finally decided to check it out. They had $2 domestics on Monday. The decor is full of funny signs and suggestive humor. We ordered a Sampler Plus (or maybe it was called the Super Sampler).   Regardless, it came with two sides. We ordered the horsey mashed potatoes and the spicy fries. The spicy fries were crunchy shoe string style fries with a bit of a kick. The mashed potatoes had a slight horseradish kick. It wasn't over powering if you're not a big horsey sauce fan.  The meat portions were good. My husband loved the turkey whereas I am more of a brisket kinda gal. We split the Sampler and it was enough food for two adults. Definitely would go again and recommend."}
{"text":"Giving a 5-star review and a thank you to Waldo's for the fantastic catered BBQ meal we had delivered this past Saturday for a special family event. Everything was so delicious: smoked chicken, beef, pork and ribs, hot and mild sauces, BBQ beans, mac & cheese. The crowd raved about the food all afternoon, and we sure wish we could have taken credit for it...but we made sure they knew about Waldo's! Our family has ordered from Waldo's in the past for a family reunion, so we already knew the product and reputation. And they were right on time, too! Thank you so much! We will always recommended you!"}
{"text":"Waldo's is by far the best BBQ in the greater Phoenix area. Everything about this place is great from the decor the staff and of course the food. They serve drinks in mason jars and cornbread with every meal. I have been here umpteen times and always excellent service and food. I always have sampler or if very hungry add half slab of ribs. The brisket is to die for. If you are in the neighborhood stop by 5pm is packed. Great value and even better food."}
{"text":"I love BBQ. And it doesn't matter the region it comes from, I love it all.  I was introduced to a Georgia style mustard based sauce from a friend, but I didn't see any on the table, or it could have been in another section of the restaurant.  This place is big. Not seeing the sauce was not a show stopper, I was curious if they had anything the same of similar.   I had the brisket nachos and they were very, good. A generous portion of brisket, two kinds of cheese, chopped green onions, a small smattering of Jalapeños, and some black beans. I have tried BBQ Nachos in other restaurants, none of them could touch these.  I think the best thing they with their nachos is to not soak everything in sauce. While that could that could be a negative for some or be a plus for customers, Waldos does it well.  From the minute I arrived, I was treated like a king.  I was seated immediately and my server was Ben.  Ben is one of the best waiters I have had in some time. He is always pleasant and really seems to enjoy his job. His mindset is perfect for this job - treat people how you want to be treated. I really can't say enough about his customer service skills or his knowledge of the menu.  Someone at the company needs to recognize Ben for his service as he surely deserves it.  The food was excellent - 2 stars Waiter was spectacular - 3 stars"}
{"text":"Their ribs are simply the best. No kidding. Their sides are generally inedible. Not once have I seen anyone finish their sides, except maybe the pinto beans, which are mostly flavorless. If they would just put some effort into their non meat items they would be world class. We have been there many times and will continue to go, but please change your recipes for sides."}
{"text":"So here is the thing, the food was pretty decent. But, the entire reasoning for the one star is staff and a poor policy. I sat at a table with friends which was a table of 6 and according to the policy a party of six or more has a forced gratuity of 18% of the entire bill. The table split the bills for our own separate parties of 3 and all of the bills were separately charged 18% for gratuity. So that being said, my bill was 51.04 and 18% was 9.18 extra. But, my friends bill was more than mine and they had the same 18% charge which is not according the policy. In technical terms, the 18% charge should have split amongst the checks for 6% per a check because of the 18% for the table party. We called the establishment only for them to tell us we were wrong and their policy was to apply 18% to each bill. The waitress made 54% across the table added up to be $20+ in a forced tip. Needless to say, the staff handle the situation poorly and I was in the right for the technicality of their policy. They refused to refund any of the 18% but only agreed to refund the small additional tip we gave that was found out to be undeserved. Shame on this establishment for not handling the situation correctly and making amends."}
{"text":"Fantastic! That's all you need to say. If you love BBQ this is the place for you. The service was great and the flavors and quantity of food you receive is awesome."}
{"text":"Great place. Got sat right away! Food was delicious! Huge portions. Staff very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered pulled pork, pulled chicken, poblano corn chowder and it really tasted bland - lots of fatty gristle in the meat and dry buns.  Soup was ok with a nice pepper flavor but thin creme base with no real contents in it.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great brisket, good ribs, great beans, mediocre pulled meat.  Sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Went in expecting great ribs and barbecue and got exactly what I wanted! Perfect for families, but it gets pretty loud."}
{"text":"We tried Waldo's BBQ for the first time today. My husband and I had the Barbecuban and it was the BEST Cuban sandwich we have ever had! We had great service by Gabe and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Here is my review: My family of 9  tried out Waldo's BBQ tonight for the first time. The hostess told us our wait would just be 10-15 minutes. After 20 minutes we were told it would just be another 10 minutes. When that 10 minutes was up we were told it would be another 10 minutes! When we were finally seated, the waitress thanked us for our patience. However, when she took our order she was very impatient tapping her foot nervously, which made me feel very rushed. (We are a big family and try our best to be prepared with our orders for the waiter so that the food ordering process is expedited) I asked the waitress what she would suggest as far as which ribs to order. She informed me that all of the meats are smoked which make them very tender and that they do not put sauce on the ribs because \"the ribs can stand on their own\" so they give customers the sauce options on the side. I ordered their baby back ribs and my husband ordered a platter that had beef brisket, sausage, pulled pork and some ribs. When I received my food, I could tell right away that my ribs were dry and not tender. The ribs had a few moments of tenderness but most of it was dry and tasteless. I usually never add salt to my food and tonight I added salt and had to use the BBQ sauce to give it some flavor. When the waitress came over to check on us it was very quick and she spoke so fast that when we tried to respond to tell her  all the things that what we needed she had already turned around  This was to her disadvantage because when she came back to deliver what we asked for we had to ask her for more stuff. If she would have slowed down and gave us a chance to tell her what our needs were all at once this would have allowed her not to make so many trips. The one good thing from our first time experience of eating at Waldo's was the live music. The band was really good and sounded just like original artist. I think it will be a very long time before we give Waldo's another chance."}
{"text":"UNLIMITED SPICY FRIES AT LUNCH TIME!!! Grabbed the brisket Ruben.... Great. good location, clean quick and friendly, everyone needs to come here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great atmosphere, big portions. They serve alcohol, even though I don't drink myself. The servers are usually nice and quick. We did have 1 server one time that was bitchy and talked bad about her busboy and complained about how busy she was. (A bit awkward). But that was only once. The servers are usually pleasant.  They need a bigger venue though. The place is too small to accommodate all the people that go there. Weekends and winter time evenings are always busy. But,worth it. You can get food to go too.  If you like all American bbq, veggies, potatoes, salad, beans, you need to go here.  Yummo. The cheapest bbq plate is 10.00. You get a good portion of meat and 2 sides of your choice and cornbread. Fills me up."}
{"text":"Staying at the resort right behind this place for the winter. Went with a group the other night for dinner. I had the Baby Back Ribs, wife had the Tennessee Sampler. The main problem is the service here. We ordered our meal and didn't get our sides until we just about through eating the main course. They brought 1 pan of BBQ sauce for a table of 8 and by time it made to us not much left. We requested another pan and that took a long time. The sides are supposed to be unlimited but good luck getting someone to request another one. We understand sometimes they can be short staffed or whatever, but the kicker and why I down rated this place is they automatically put a 18% gratuity on your bill if you are in a group over 6. I think they take advantage of people who come over from the parks in groups. I wouldn't mind paying it if the service was up to par, but I didn't get that choice. In addition, the checks were brought while we were still eating. The desert menu looked to have some good choices that my wife was thinking about trying, but we felt bum rushed to get out. Too bad, because many people were anxious to hear how it was and we don't have positive to say."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of my family. BBQ done right, and I am impossible to please when it comes to BBQ.  Pulled pork and chicken that is perfectly prepared, fresh corn bread, mason jars of drinks and ice tea, and the greatest BBQ sauce this side of the Mississippi. Oh and did I mention the sides OMG!  Mac and cheese is to die for.  The place is packed during snowbird season and summer so I am not the one who loves it.  Don't like a crowd?   Call ahead for take out and go get you something yummy.  The Riblet Basket is unforgettable, you got to try it. Uber consumer tips: More parking on the side, don't forget to save room for a brownie.  Yes they serve spirits and beers. Ask for an extra pulled pork order for to go! It makes a great sandwich son a Hogie Bun later!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to see them open a location in Gilbert. Even if they hadn't, we'd still be driving to their Mesa location. Anyway, the food is simply delicious. It's real BBQ. The portions are generous and the free refills on some side dishes is a nice touch. When the weather is nice, the outdoor seating is a must. The night we were there, they had live music. That was fun too. Our favorites are the ribs, with fried okra and grilled veggies (gotta eat healthy, right!?!?!)"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit.  I have upped the rating from 3 to 4 stars. The ribs are excellent!!  So far we have tried baked potato, potato wedges, fried okra, green chile mac and cheese and the boiled corn on the cob.  The mac n cheese really needs help. It is watery and not very cheesy.  The cornbread is just mediocre.  Still we enjoy the food and the service tonight was exceptional.  My hubby ordered sweet tea and after his first taste asked if the tea was indeed sweet. The waiter felt this was acceptable tea and made fresh!!! That is above and beyond these days.  He truly cared for our service!!  Jacob is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Memphis and a bbq snob. This was awesome bbq. The service was great along with great food. I recommend this place highly if bbq is what you want you'll find it here Colby was an awesome server."}
{"text":"I know this place has been here a while because I have been going here since I was a kid. There are other Waldo's locations in Arizona but this it the one to go to. It has been around the longest and you just can't get that smoky flavor at any other location.  I know my BBQ and this is hands down the best BBQ in the state!!! The super sampler is HUGE and probably enough for two people but when I am here, I just don't want to share. Their baby back ribs fall off the bone and have an unmatched flavor. With the super sampler you get a 1/4 slab of baby back and your choice of 3 meets. I always go with the brisket, pulled pork, and turkey.   The brisket was perfect with very little fat. The pulled pork was amazing! It was moist, tender, and fell apart in my mouth. The turkey was about the same, moist and falling apart in my mouth. Their meet makes it easy for me to except getting old because I know that even if I lost all my teeth I could still eat here. Luckily  I should still have about 50 years before I have to worry about that.   I almost forgot to mention the sides you get with that meal....they are unlimited!!!! The fried corn on the cobb and okra was just what I needed to complete the meal.   That is just a little about the food, because you honestly need to taste it to believe it.   My buddy and I went there at 1230 for lunch and the service was great. We were seated quickly and our food was out in just a couple of minutes. The jalapeno  corn bread (which is free) was gone in seconds after hitting our table. Our mason jars of tea and water were refilled faster then we could drink them.   This may not be the fanciest BBQ place in town or the \"hippest\" right now, but this is the BEST BBQ in Arizona. I lived in Texas, have family from Missouri, and visit Georgia and this is the best. If you were blindfolded and tasting BBQ from the top 5 places for BBQ in Arizona, the food at this location would win.  Everything was just amazing!!!!!!!! Thank you Waldo's!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waldo's is definitely my go-to BBQ place in Arizona. My girlfriend showed me this place and ever since then whenever we crave some good BBQ, Waldo's is always the first on the list. To start off, they have the best BBQ sauce that I have ever tasted. It's definitely not your every day BBQ sauce it has a really great smoky flavor that you don't normally find in BBQ sauce. Secondly, they have AMAZING fall off the bone ribs. We have tried both the baby back and spare ribs and both have been delicious. On top of the great ribs and the BBQ sauce, they also have delicious fries, onion rings, and my girlfriend absolutely loves their ranch! The restaurant has a really cool decor and the service has always been very quick and friendly. Waldo's has top notch BBQ and I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Had a PHENOMINAL time tonight.  Sampler platter with ribs, chicken and brisket was the BEST I have had in AZ.  In addition to great food and wonderful atmosphere, the good looking Carvin Jones and his band were playing GREAT music!  Carvin plays guitar with one hand!,,,,,Had the best time, reasonable prices, family friendly too!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place two stars just for the sake of the friendly servers but after a restaurant makes you terribly ill,  minimum ratings are required.   The cornbread tastes like instant mix you stir with water then bake - aka bland and dry.   My daughter had the macaroni and cheese which is actually jalapeño Mac & cheese but the kids' menu didn't specify that. Definitely too spicy for a child. I questioned the server who said \"That's the only kind we have.\"  I had grilled chicken which the server proudly quizzed me on \"Guess what two ingredients we use to marinate the chicken.\" When my answer was incorrect he proclaimed \"Orange juice and Italian dressing!\" In my opinion using pre-made Italian dressing is the lazy way to marinate anything and this choice was reflected in the flavor. Worse than that was the French fries which were paradoxically burning hot yet drenched and soggy - I'm guessing they were twice fried which is a big no no.   My husband had the mixed sampler plate which was a disappointing array of greasy, wet meats.   The dining experience was not the end however,  we suffered the consequences of the food all night long with awful gut cramps and frequent bathroom trips.   Sadly my husband's fond reminiscent memories of this place as a kid have been destroyed. We will never return."}
{"text":"The food was OKAY.  The worse part was our server, Kylie.  She didn't acknowledge us at all! Until the end, asking us how the band was doing.  Anyways 40$ for dry BBQ, no thanks.  I love the selection in your draft beers.  The end. :("}
{"text":"I found this place to be very average. The meats were completely flavorless unless dipped in bbq sauce and I wasn't that thrilled with the sauce. I would go back if invited by friends but won't return if I am just looking for someplace to eat. There are a lot better bbq places around than this."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now; both times picked up orders to go. I had no problems or issues with the first order, so returned for a second - as the food was good (Mac and cheese is great). The meat was typical BBQ and I had no complaints.  The second order I picked up, I ordered a large pulled pork sandwich (along with the rest of my large order) with the plan of splitting a small portion of the meat to a smaller bun since I cannot eat a full sandwich.. All was great, as I paid, I asked if another extra bun could be added to my order. The friendly young man who was checking me out said \"sure, no problem\" I was fully prepared to pay whatever the coat of this simple, extra bun. When across the counter, the bun police hollered, \"we don't sell single buns!\" - I was taken back and thought she was kidding, nope - she went on to educate me on how they \"only sell buns by the dozen!  Really? I was stunned, we are talking about a .40 cent item, and this egomaniac had to make sure she flexed her muscles and was not going to let that extra bun get passed her..!  Even the poor guy checking me out rolled his eyes and apologized..  That's it for me,\"Ms Bun Police\".. You saved Waldo's from the crime of selling a single bun... Now you can keep it all... Your buns, your meat, even those silly candies you throw around so freely (which cost more than the bun I was trying to PAY you for) This isn't really about the bun, I went to the store and got all the buns I needed... It's about the service- what harm would it have caused you to sell that one bun? You GIVE away corn bread to dine in customers.. You needed to feel big and bad, make sure this customer didn't get something by \"you\"..  You did your job today, saved a bun -and lost a customer!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were craving BBQ and found this nice little gem of a restaurant. On the way there, we could smell the bbq about 50 yards away... So, if you happen to miss the big signs just close your eyes and follow your nose.   When we walked in we were greeted with a welcome and seated right away. Our server Dave gave us a little run down about the menu and his recommendations. We ended up getting the super sampler and shared it. The pulled pork, beef, and ribs were amazing!!! Our third item, brisket, wasn't all too good. There was a lot of FAT on the cut and didn't enjoy is as much.   The original and spicy sauce were good as well. I wasn't a big fan of the Louisiana sauce but gave it a try. You probably would like it if your into spicy sauces. Servings were big and we were given an unlimited amount of (two) sides along with our meal. Price was good and left the place wanting more.   We will definitely come back and bring more people next time."}
{"text":"I got the meat sampler here and like Eric M. said it was a skillet of grease with lots of meat on top. The BBQ sauce is good and the meat was good but greasy. I don't like cornbread with the peppers in it, its sick and whoever thought it was a good idea needs to re-evaluate their life. I like normal cornbread, not cornbread with random crap in it. I prefer Joe's Real BBQ any day."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a good salad? Well if you have, the side salad at Waldo's you'll certainly be disappointed. The bleu cheese dressing was pure liquid, not a trace of creamy goodness.   However, that being said, the meat does not disappoint. I got the barbecuban which is a take on the classic cubano. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the delicious BBQ sauce complimented the Dijon and pickles nicely. The roll was firm but not hard and the cheese was nicely melted. All in all a delicious sandwich. They don't skimp on the sauce if you take your food to go, delivering 3 to-go containers of that delicious brown BBQ sauce.   They serve you a basket of jalapeño cornbread after ordering. I was initially excited but overall a little disappointed. The jalapeños in the corn bread aren't quite spicy enough to really compliment the bread overall, it was more just a weird pepper texture amidst an otherwise decent piece of cornbread.  Overall this really isn't a bad spot to eat, not the best barbecue in town but it lands solidly in the middle. I'd rank their sauce quite highly and it is the glue that holds this whole operation together."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places been going here since I was a child perfect atmosphere!!! The staff is  fast the food ....is literally perfect! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the bathroom it's not the best. But if BBQ is what your looking for then it's amazing ;)"}
{"text":"This Waldos BBQ location is great! Good food and excellent service. Kylie, our server, was awesome. Very attentive & friendly. Food came out fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here twice.  The beer sample smelled like chlorine so I guess they never rinsed the mason jar.  The Shriner beer was good; wished I had a large.  Mac-n-cheese runny but the green chili bits were a nice touch.  The deep fried chicken was AWESOME.  The sausage was sort of mangy with an odd aftertaste.  Cornbread good; get butter.  Skillet of sauce was too generous; was it half a bottle?  The Waldo sandwich was THE BOMB.  I ordered a pulled pork and pit ham Waldo and it was probably over a pound of meat.  Add some BBQ sauce and you have an excellent sandwich [although sauce not required].  I have never had a better sandwich.  With coleslaw I suppose it is even better.  Buy a Waldo to go.  Pulled pork.  Pit ham."}
{"text":"S'good ... Yup. Sauces were excellent even though the meat didn't need them. Stop reading and eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, not horrible but not fabulous.  Went on a Saturday evening 5:30 ish, place was full but we (party of 3) were seated in less than 5 min.  The waitress we had was great - sorry I didn't get her name :(  We ordered smoked turkey platter - very moist and great smoke flavor, a pulled chicken sandwich - nothing special here, and a combo plate of ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  I don't eat beef/pork but my son said the pulled pork was the best of the 3 meats but that Joe's BBQ was much better.  They have a basic BBQ sauce which I thought was VERY good, the Louisianna BBQ  one was super spicy, almost gave my son an asthma attack (he's kinda a wimp).  The cornbread was not good at all, they have unlimited sides we had mac n cheese, 1 of the 3 of us loved it, sweet potato fries - delish, and potato wedges - nothing good or bad it's just a potato.  Their Cherry Lemonade was very good, drinks come in a jar the size of a mayo jar. We split the tab so for 2 people the 3 meat platter and the turkey platter was $38 seems pricey to me.  I'd probably go back as it wasn't terrible, but I would rather go to Joe's.  However if you are ever in Tucson and you want some great BBQ try Brushfire!!!! They know cornbread!!!"}
{"text":"I guess I have to go against the grain and write a fair review giving it only 2 stars.  We had the Tennessee platter, consisting of pulled pork and country ribs. The pulled pork was ok, but the country ribs were more fat than meat. Not the most appetizing thing. Very heavy and greasy.  The meat comes dry with a bowl of bbq sauce to dip in.  They offer 'endless' sides, which is great value. The fried okra and the coleslaw were the best. The Mac & cheese was rather bland but did come with little pieces of bacon in it. We also had the cowboy beans which were probably the worst tasting out of the sides we ordered.  The service was good, friendly and casual atmosphere.  It definitely was not a 4 star according to many reviewers. We were disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Now I'm no BBQ connoisseur but I really like this place.  I've tried all the various meats (except the chicken)  and I love them all. They do an amazing job with the ribs which I find isn't always the case for BBQ places in AZ.  Pile on all you can eat sides and the reasonable price and this place is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Better than expected.  Food and service were wonderful."}
{"text":"Visited Waldo's for lunch, and the service, food and atmosphere are all awesome! I can't wait to go back to try more stuff from the menu. I had the brisket sandwich with unlimited mac n cheese as my side. I really like how you sauce the sandwich yourself - keeps the bread from getting too soggy."}
{"text":"Gross.  If you like your food sitting in pool of grease then you'll love this place.  It just was not good.  Potatoes were cold, the meats were just okay, but once I saw the puddle of grease, that was it for me.    Never again."}
{"text":"Very tender meats juice. love the prices. They also cater where I work and service is good and fast."}
{"text":"We ordered the Tennessee sampler, pulled pork quesadillas, hot links and beef brisket. for sides we had the fried okra, horsey spuds, Mac n cheese and the haystack. This food was so good, tons of leftovers. We will definitely be back.  Would highly recommend this restaurant. Very friendly staff, very helpful and knowledgeable on the food."}
{"text":"Won't be back. We ordered take-out, a \"large\" gobbler and a rib/chicken \"platter\" and fries, coleslaw, and corn on the cob as our sides. The gobbler was a floppy sandwich - regular-sized sandwich roll bread. Nothing large about it or the 3 small chunks of turkey thrown in. The turkey was tasteless and the bread was soggy even without sauce, ugh. The fries tasted okay but hadn't been drained before they were dumped in the box. I'm not sure how the platter got it's name - a couple of ribs and a piece of chicken. The chicken had some flavor, the ribs not so much. The coleslaw was drowned in mayo and - oddly - only tasted like mayo. There are a lot of great restaurants in Gilbert, but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I went to waldos a few weeks ago.  I am not a huge fan of bbq.  I had ribs and split it in half, as well as sweet potatoe fries and beans.  Everything was cooked perfectly, and the staff was super friendly.  I would much rather come here than most commercial bbq joints."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food only met up with friends to have a drink. Live band was playing 2-9-18. Sounded great."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but the last 2 times the ribs were tough and had lots of gristle in it. I told our waitress that the ribs were very tough and she basically said too bad. Our salads were also warm, did not seem fresh. I will never be going back and would not recommend them."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago, loved it, meant to come back, never made it, left town, and every time I got back to town I would remember this place and how good it was but it never seemed to be the direction I was going or else I would be near it but have already eaten or be short on time. I always regretted not having gotten back.   The other day my daughter and I had an activity not too far from here so I suggested we come here for dinner. We both loved it. The atmosphere was very family-friendly which we appreciated since we had a six year old with us. The service was mostly good with one small flaw. The food was absolutely delicious and the price was reasonable. Last time I had gotten some sort of a reasonably priced combination plate. I think it was about $8 then, and maybe $10 now. This time my daughter suggested something we have done before in restaurants, we got a big combination plate and split it. They didn't charge any extra for the splitting either which I liked. We got a kids meal hamburger for $4.99 for my grandson but they did charge a dollar extra to add American cheese.   The combination we chose included four meats. We got the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and pulled beef. The beef brisket wasn't the most tender I'd ever had although it wasn't unpleasant. Both pulled meats were wonderful, I just wish there had been a little more of them.  But the winner on the plate, the best of them all, was definitely the ribs. They had to have been some of the best, most tender ribs I have ever had. I probably ate more than I normally do because the meat was so easy to chew and went down so easy. It also included two sides. I got sweet potato fries. Unfortunately I completely forgot to take a photo of the food, just one of the iced sweet tea which which was free with my Yelp check-in.   I look forward to going back and I believe my daughter does too!"}
{"text":"BABY BACK RIBS!!!!!!!!!!!! OK phoenix, well reading all these reviews and I'm sad! this place hands down has the BEST baby back ribs in the valley period!! but most people in phx don't know what good food is anyways! these baby back are smoked to perfection and so god dam tender, and there rub is great and i get them \"wet\" sauced then grilled again, side are ok but im not going there for the sides, im there for those baby back ribs! trust me just go and get a slab or five now!"}
{"text":"Waldo's is an average BBQ place. Just a step down from Famous Dave's which is okay. Ham did not  have a lot of flavor and was fatty. The BBQ sauces taste pretty much the same.  The frys would be a lot better if they were cooked longer.  Waldo's isn't bad it's just not great either."}
{"text":"Been to this place many time but have never left a review!  I love the beef brisket here, fantastic. The smoked turkey is pretty dang good too. Nice change over pulled pork.  They serve jalapeno corn bread while you wait for your dinner!   The BBQ sauces are very flavorful, not just sugared up crap!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Waldo's since there was one located in South Scottsdale at Hayden and Thomas. Never went into the place that replaced them.   It was dead, sadly because the food was good. According to a previous review that must mean I like mediocre Bbq?   I can't say I'm a pro but it was definitely worth more than a few stars.   Our drink orders were taken upon being seated.  We all got our corn bread at the beginning of our meal, bits jalapeño and corn... yum.  I had the clucker sandwich with a side of horsey mashed spuds. Of course the bun was moist when it arrived (there was hot chicken on top) but I am glad the BBQ sauce came out on the side to help prevent it for disintegrating entirely. The sauce was good, though next time we may explore other sauce options just to try them out.  The bf got the pulled pork sandwich Memphis style. Again, really glad they didn't put the sauce or the slaw on the bun and create bread soup,sog,mush. So, thank you. He also had a side of spicy fries which he indicated were more Cajun season than spice.  Kiddo number one had the BBQ street tacos with Beef. Complained only that they had too much beef, to which I explained most people would complain about not enough and that I understand he isn't most people.  Kiddo number 2 went with a grilled cheese. No complaints... ate it all except the crust because that's how she rolls.   Our waitress came by to check on us a few times, no complaints about service it food.   We'll be back for a skookie soon!"}
{"text":"Yup, yup...still a fan. Service is still good, but they've definitely improved on my french fry complaint - my fries were hot and burned my mouth. WOO HOO! :)  Everything was as good as I remembered it. I docked a star because part of my brisket was really tough so I didn't eat that part...it has become a reward for my cute little dog Rex. :)  Still 2 thumbs up from me and hubby."}
{"text":"Food is good, the decor is unique, prices are reasonable, but the noise level pretty intolerable.  We could not carry on a conversation in there."}
{"text":"Very pleased! I took my parents here and the food was delicious all around. I got the sampler with pulled pork, beef, and chicken and mom got the ribs. So tender and perfect omg! Literally falls right off the bone. It comes with 2 types of bbq sauce but u almost don't need em bc all their meats are so flavorful by themselves.  drinks are affordable and some of their sides are even bottomless!! To top it off, the owner served us all night and was hella cool."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" restaurant. The portions are large enough to share. They have the best iced tea, with plenty of free refills. All of the BBQ is amazing without being too spicy and the corn bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about Waldo's so I had time today see for myself. I ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and slaw & from the 1st taste it was the best BBQ I've had, so good I ordered another sandwich  World-class BBQ"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. It's always the same go to for me, baby back ribs with boiled corn. Absolutely delicious. We always pick up to go, but this place is always packed. Great eats!"}
{"text":"The Brisket and pulled pork at this joint knocked my socks off!  Seriously, when you go there look for my socks!  While you're there try the peach cobbler with ice cream in a skillet, it changed my life.  The service is awesome and David was great.  The only thing Waldo's needs is a place to take a nap when you're done eating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Good, the BBQ sauce is average. Food was good. Had takeout, so not sure how the service was.  Will have again? Prob, only because its closer than other BBQ places"}
{"text":"This was always my go to BBQ restaurant when I lived in Mesa 15 years ago, and I'll say it's just as good today as it was back then, it was nice to visit... just wish there was one in my town.  The \"BEST\" hands down.  Busy night, great service great food!  But I will say that my brisket was a little dry, I'm sure they would have exchanged it if I asked... but I'm not too picky.  Thanks For the memories Waldo!  You gotta try the fried corn on the cob, no kidding!!!"}
{"text":"These are the best ribs we've found in the valley. Always moist and the sauce is delicious. The sides aren't anything special, just ok, but the ribs will get all your attention anyway. We order to-go often."}
{"text":"Our family has been looking for great BBQ for a while. We have tried a lot of the local fare and it's good, but the sauce was never quite right. This was the best sauce we have had in quite a while. The meat was also cooked to perfection. We had the Pig (Pulled pork sandwich) and each got one endless side. I got Mac and cheese and she got fries. She didn't like the fries, and I didn't like the Mac and cheese. We switched and each loved it. It's all about finding the side that works for you. The lemonade was great, especially the cherry lemonade. We got a side of ribs to go and we will definitely be back on a Wednesday for their all you can eat baby back ribs.  TL;DR: Great BBQ, okay sides once you find one you like. Awesome ribs."}
{"text":"Meat was fatty, tough and stringy. \"Haystack\" onions rings are Thick slices - not at all what we were expecting. Generous portions and friendly staff got them the 3-star. Otherwise - meh. Not planning to go back. Dickey's is way better."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq sauce! We tried the brisket, turkey, chicken and pork. It was all delicious! The potato wedges are very fresh and the Mac and cheese has a perfect kick to it. The sweet tea is also really good!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Waldos many many times over the last couple years... I really like the BBQ sauce, but that is about where it stops. Slash, the skookie is brilliant...  Last time I went, we showed up at about 8:25pm and got in to eat... at 8:30pm they stopped letting people it. So even though they say they close at 9:00pm, they really close at 8:30pm.  I like Waldos but i feel like there is always something missing when I go, not sure what it is but recently I have felt like they need something."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, this is where my mom wanted to go on Mother's Day. I can't remember having gone here since I was about 9, and then I just remembered pigs everywhere and sawdust on the floor.  I could tell as soon as we walked in that little had changed at Waldo's over the years! I'm not usually a huge bbq fan, I'm not big on sweet sauces, but I really enjoyed my meal. Our server was very (maybe overly) attentive and friendly, but there were only 2 other tables in the place at 4pm. (It kind of seemed like during our meal the whole staff would be watching us from the counter which reminded me a little of Fried Green Tomatoes... and we all know what was in that barbecue.. )  I had a combo plate with pulled pork and ribs and they were both very flavorful and tender. It came with two sides-I had the cowboy beans which were pretty underwhelming, but I liked my sweet potato fries. The cornbread brought to the table was cold, I'm not sure if that was intentional or not. I also liked how everything was served in little skillets, cute touch.   All in all, everything was very friendly and down home feeling. It is far from me in Phoenix so I don't think I'd make a trip just for that, but if I was hanging out in Mesa, it would definitely be on my mind."}
{"text":"These guys have good, quality BBQ. Unfortunately for them, I'm comparing them to Porkopolis and Joe's BBQ, which they come up short against. I got the super sampler with Mac n cheese and fries. Both sides were good. The meats, including ribs were just average BBQ. Nothing special. Good taste, but again, being compared to some other spots, I won't be going back. Worth trying if you haven't been to Joe's or Porkopolis, but if you have, stick with them."}
{"text":"Wow, this place smells Amazing! Great staff! Fresh salad and awesome ribs! The time we waited for our food was reasonable. The place was clean...did I say it smells Amazing?! Next door is also a neat little gift shop if you are into that. I actually asked the gals in my swimming class for a place and they mentioned big chains including Tony Romas--but they weren't sure if that was still around. I can hardly wait to go back and tell them the great experience we had here today! 1/2rack of ribs were to die for!"}
{"text":"My first time visit here (and my last) was disappointing.  We waited a Long time before our server came to our table and I was unimpressed with his skills, which is another story. The pulled pork was dry, tasteless (no surprise they have 6 sauces at the table to add flavor), the bun was on the stale side, and I had a hard time keeping the luke warm meat inside. Fries were hot and tasty, the best part of our meal.  Won't  return."}
{"text":"It was my turn to pick a place we'd never been and we were waaaay out east so my wife's aunt suggested Waldo's. I'm a dick about BBQ, please do not give me crap boiled meat & some pancake syrup with liquid smoke & hope I just shut up & eat.  I prefer mom & pop places and love places that have been in business forever, so I had high hopes.   go to waldo's.  just shut up, I know it's hot and for almost everyone in Phoenix, it's waaaay over there but, it's worth it. If the city hasn't burned down in this drought and you happen to be reading this in cooler weather ... really go now. There's a little gift shop next door and blah blah blah, who cares, let's talk about the meat.  I got the brisket sandwich, like a cheese pizza, if you can't do that, you can't do this. The brisket was tender, the smoke ring was beautiful and the meat is delicious. I never needed the sauce, but for giggles, I had some of the sauce. The regular sauce in the little lodge cast iron is fantastic, smoky, not too sweet and NOT that crap \"Texas\" BBQ sauce that bottles at sold at stores for idiots. Pauline suggested I try the jerk sauce and add a touch to the mac & cheese and Pauline is right. if you go & Pauline is your server, listen to Pauline. the wife got the pulled pork sandwich and that was moist & tender. kids each got the fried mac & cheese and loved it. I can't speak for any desserts, because we were too full to even try. The table next to us all had different desserts and no one was complaining or making a bunch of noise or even making ANY noise except the silverware hitting ice cream dishes and mason jars. I'm guessing by their silence they were happy.  (and they were cheerleaders so silence was NOT their strong point)  anyway, yeah. go.   AND ...eat there so it's nice and fresh.  By the time you get home it'll be cold so quit being such a mamby pamby and actually go risk sitting next to someone you don't know, I swear your phone will forgive you for putting it down for 10 seconds. By the time the task rabbit delivery driver finds your house, he'll have eaten half your fries and stolen other stuff from you also, so skip the stupid delivery service."}
{"text":"Wow !!!! Love this place & their awesome Bbq - Kylie is awesome - y'all should come check this amazing place out !!!!"}
{"text":"This was my sixth visit. The place is so fun, I try to bring friends and family to try their food and enjoy the whole experience. The ribs fall from the bone. I don;t think I ever used a knife in this place... Service was very good and my cousin went away delighted by the food and the service. Love it"}
{"text":"I've seen a guy write positive reviews with song lyrics, so I'm going to try a different route. This place was just bad.  To the tune of Taylor Swifts new single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".   I don't like your bad decour Don't like your dirty floor The amount you made me pay Of the food, no, I don't like you I don't like your dry turkey How you barely cooked fries You said the ribs were divine Werent though, no, I don't like them(oh!)  But the food got worse, so much worse, not worth a dime Honey, it was bland, so very bland try some rub sometime I've had some bad bbq, and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!  Ooh, look what you made me do Look at this bad review Look what you just made me do You inspired this bad review Ooh, look what you made me do The pulled pork was dry too Look what you just made me do Look what you just made me do  \"I'm sorry, the old Michael can't come to the phone right now.\" \"Why?\" \"Oh, 'cause he choked on burnt corn\" (ohh!)"}
{"text":"Both times I went there I ordered \"all you can eat\" catfish. I got my first serving after about 20 minutes. It cosisted of two slices of fish.  I figured they must have had a problem in the kitchen. When I ordered more fish,  I waited another 20 minutes and only got ONE piece of small fish.  I found this place a good place to eat if you want to spend an entire evening.  Skip it!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Waldo's express, so it was exciting to go to the original restaurant. The food was just as good, but a bit more pricey, which is understandable since its a sit down rather than a drive through. The decor is hilarious, you can spend your entire meal reading all of the signs on the walls. The service was pretty good too! The first booth they put us in was REALLY uncomfortable, but they were totally fine with switching us to a table. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here Friday night for takeout. Ordered the sampler platter with brisket, turkey and chicken.  When I opened up the container I could not tell which was chicken and which was turkey. It was ALL dark meat. When ordering chicken and turkey at other BBQ places it is always white meat. Was disappointed. The brisket was okay and the only good thing was the young lady who took our to go order. Very sweet and pleasant."}
{"text":"Had a night out with the family and we decided we were in the mood for barbecue. Now I'm a huge fan of barbecue and have had my fair share of spots around town. I'm usually not over critical of places I eat but this one was a let down. My only 2 pet peeves when it comes to barbecue spots were in full affect at this place.   1. The amount of food you get is pathetic. I got the large sized pig sandwich and when it came out it reminded me of a high school cafeteria meal. I got potato wedges as my side, there for 5 wedges... I finished in about 5 minutes feeling as if I had just finished an appetizer.   2. They were very protective of their barbecue sauce. As someone who loves barbecue, I love when it covers my food, especially when I order any sort of pulled pork. The way they do their sauce is they bring it out in a small skillet for the entire table. Now this would be fine for a group of 2 or 3, but with a party of 7 this was probably the most annoying part of the night. And asking for another side got you a cynical response of \"oh that's the barbecue for the table, I can get you another side for an extra charge.\"   It's a shame because this place has a nice theme and there was a live band when we came which was pretty cool. But maybe bring out some adult portions of food and stop hoarding the sauce, after all that's the whole point of a barbecue restaurant. Save yourself the money and disappointment and avoid this cheap excuse for a barbecue joint."}
{"text":"Waldo's, they've got the art of BBQ down! we were seated promptly and given some fresh baked jalapeno cornbread, very tasty! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, it was the best pulled pork i have ever had! very tender and juicy with lots of smoky flavor, not dry and chewy like at many other poser BBQ joints. the decor is full of old whimsical signs and i think there's even a flying pig on the ceiling. definitely worth checking out if your on the east side of the valley"}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try. The fire pit and outdoor area are gorgeous. Unfortunately, the food was awful. We both had the brisket sandwich. The beef was dry, unseasoned, flavorless.  Even the bun was hard.  Not hard because it had been heated on the grill, hard as in stale.  The barbecue sauce was yummy. Not matter how much sauce, we couldn't get past the dry meat and stale bun. For my side I ordered the horsey spuds. Again dry and I couldn't taste ANY horseradish. The corn on the cob was ok. The chain barbecue restaurants are better. We were so disappointed."}
{"text":"Best place that we always agree on to eat at!  The beans are the best and homemade, not from a can and all you can eat! Lots of all you can eat sides, great choices of bbq sauce and nice smoke on the meats. Ask for Skyler for a server! He is great and will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"Ok. I am from TX and grew up around BBQ. Some of the specialties are sausage and especially brisket. If you look at my pics the first round of brisket was so over cooked I could not separate it with a fork and knife by pulling it. Tough ,all one color and dry as a bone. The replacement brisket was moist but unfortunately had no flavor whatsoever. WARNING this meat was not smoked. It is oven prepared and that is obvious by bark of the meat."}
{"text":"1st time but not the last time we'll dine here... A+... My husband is a rib snob and he believes this BBQ joint ranks as one of the BEST for ribs... The beef brisket was up on the charts too... DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I don't think I could have been happier with my experience at Waldo's! Last weekend was my first visit since I was 11 (10 years ago) I appreciated it much more as an adult. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich & Mashed potatoes. The sandwich comes in two sizes, Small or Large. I ordered a small, which was actually pretty big! The sides are unlimited which I thought was a nice touch! I only needed one order, but other members in our party utilized the unlimited factor. The food was very very delightful, not one complaint from our party of four. The prices were surprisingly low for the quality of food provided! The atmosphere is very warm, and the staff reflected that. All in all, this will not be my last time at Waldo's!"}
{"text":"The first time it was OK at Waldo's the second time was today was there with my sons orderd the St. Louis ribs and that meet was foul, but found out at end, the bones were soft and slimy, the meat did not taste right!! Would never go there again, told the server and no results, i have ate ribs all my life and that meat was old and foul!!, was nauseous when i left and will notify health dept asap!!! Tried to call the talk to the manager but of course nobody answers the phone of course not they don't want to hear any complaints!! Don't waste your money or your time on the dump!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The food was good and our server, Kylie was superb. She was very friendly and checked on us regularly!"}
{"text":"Well, I have only been here once. My wife suggested it, she's come here with her grandfather for years, when she's out visiting him. The last time she came here was a little over a year ago. She said it was awesome.   It's ok.   She ordered her favorite, baby back ribs. I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich. Small,  not large. Small appetite tonight.   First off, the staff was super friendly. Our waitress knew the menu well, and was able to offer good suggestions, and info on the side dishes.   The sandwich looked great. I didn't know what to pick as a side, I asked the waitress how the potato salad was. She said \"it's mustard based.\" I asked if it was good though. She said it was \"ok.\" I asked it it was home made, she said no. So, store bought. Nice.   The sandwich looked great, and was ok. There was a big slab of fat in it. The potato wedges were good.   The ribs my wife got were pretty gross. Really fatty. I couldn't eat one, it was that gross. What wasn't fatty was mushy. She also had the Mac and cheese. Same thing, gross.   The barbecue sauce was really good. My wife was really disappointed that it wasn't good. She said her grandpa would be upset it wasn't as good as usual. Personally I'm hoping it was just a bad night, but I can say store bought sides are lame. I know it's unlimited sides, but I'd rather have one good side then a ton of gross sides.   I prolly won't be back, only because I live in California. If I lived here I'd give them another shot, they are super nice, and the sauce was good."}
{"text":"Moved into the area about a year ago and finally gave Waldo's a try. The atmosphere is relaxed and the service is phenomenal. Our group ordered every meat item on the menu between us. It was all good but nothing was great. The quality and variety of sauces was excellent. It's not the best BBQ I've ever had but the service and variety warrant another visit."}
{"text":"BEST BBQ in the STATE! Wow..came out this way to visit family in Mesa. Saw the parking lot jam packed. Had to be good! We ordered.the combo Waldos pork and brisket. Unbelievably amazing! Great, prompt service. Will continue coming back for sure!! The best pulled pork!! BBQ sauce choices are excellent. Hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I did a Google search for Waldo's BBQ on Williams Field Rd. I checked out the site and looked over the menu to see what sandwiches they offered. The sandwiches were listed at $7.95. Sides $2.00.  I went to the restaurant. As I got ready to place my to go order, I noticed the prices were very different. Sandwiches on the menu were $9.99. Sides $2.99. I showed the supervisor the website with the $7.95 prices. She said it's not their menu. I showed her, step by step, how I got to the menu I was looking at. Didn't matter. They DID NOT honor the lower prices even after I showed them what I was looking at. I WILL NOT be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I was craving bbq and this place is right down the street from where I live so I decided to come on a whim. I got the brisket sandwich with potato salad. They give you a piece of jalapeño cornbread too. It is Sunday so the bloody Mary's are $5 not bad and they were pretty tasty. The brisket was a lil over cooked for my taste but add a lil bbq and you're good, the bun for the sandwich wasn't toasted and I think that would've made the sandwich better. The cornbread is good with some butter and I added some of the jalapeño pepper sauce they have on the table cus I like it spicy. The potato salad tasted homemade so that's a win for me. The service is great!! I'll definitely be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not the place for me although the veggies and the sweet tea was on point! If you like your meat with no sauce and pulled chicken this place is for you. My family also likes the jar cheesecake and BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"This place has the best ribs ever! They staff and waiters are super cool and friendly. Gab is one of our favorite waiters. He is like family now, knows us by name and treats us like we're special. The atmosphere is real laid back and never too busy to get us a table quickly. They also have live music most days. The peach cobbler is the best"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Waldo's for a while now, and all I can say is what took us so long? Holy cow(or should I say pig) this place is great! We were greeted right away upon entering and seated. Our waiter who also happened to be the catering manager, was by right away to get our drink orders. About a minute later he was back with large mason jars full of diet coke. After reviewing the menu full of bbq amazingness, i decided on the bbq burger. It comes with your choice of side, I chose the potato wedges. Our food came quickly and looked and smelled amazing! Our waiter also brought out a small skillet of their homemade bbq sauce. My burger was cooked to perfection. It was topped with provolone cheese, onion rings and bbq sauce. The potato wedges were crispy and delicious. The decor is rugged, with the inside adorned with funny signs on the walls, and clouds with pigs in airplanes on the ceiling(when pigs fly). There are wood chips on the floor. The service is fast and friendly, and you bet I'll be back for a BBQ fix."}
{"text":"We got the beef ribs which were great. We also had the beef brisket which was not eatable. It was rubbery and fatty. I actually spit it out. I'll probably go again for the beef ribs as they are difficult to find and were tasty."}
{"text":"We  ordered the super sampler with pulled pork chicken an brisket. Some grilled veggies and Mac n cheese. Also orderd vodka tonic and wine. Club soda instead of tonic water and wine was not cold. Stick to beer at this place. All in all the food was pretty great but I have to say the service was terrible. The hostess just stood there for long periods of time staring out the door, the window, at customers. Not helping anyone. Just staring. Lol. Just don't expect very great service. But like I said. The food was good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and they are consistent.  We are usually seated within a couple minutes if there is a wait, but there usually isn't during lunch. The meats is juicy, never dry. I had the BBQ Pork quesadilla for luch, says it's an appetizer but it's a meal. Finished off with warm peach cobbler. Quick, simple food. Love it here."}
{"text":"This place has great food, great prices, great service, and GREAT ambiance! The decorations were spot on. The cornbread we got to eat was truly horrible.. but it was free so I'll ignore that. It was ice cold, dry, and flavorless. I ordered the brisket with mac and cheese and spicy fries. I really though the sides were delicious, and BONUS, they're unlimited!! The brisket had good flavor but was a bit dry but the bbq sauce totally fixed that! MY party also had the fried okra, veggies, riblets, and one of the combo meals with 3 different meats. They all said it was some of the best bbq they've had! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fun environment, friendly service, this is a great BBQ establishment.  The ribs and BBQ chicken were delicious.  The sides offered here are a bonus!!"}
{"text":"Waiting 20 minutes to be told we don't have a lot of the items you ordered. U couldn't tell me that when I got here! Huge waste of time.!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ joint.  Used to go to the one on Thomas and Scottsdale road years ago. Got the BBQ Cuban sandwich. Meat was fantastic, bread wasn't all that great though. The ribs here are my usual go to meal.  they have awesome beef ribs too! lastly, the half chicken is so tender you can almost drink it!  I love that they serve a hot skillet full of BBQ sauce on the side.  If you are in the area give it a try!"}
{"text":"We came here on Thursday night for dinner. The atmosphere was great, including the singer who was perfoming that evening. I had the smoked turkey dinner, which was delicious. My wife had the sampler, which consisted of brisket, hot link, and pulled pork. All of the meats were very flavorful and juicy. The portion sizes were great and so was the service. The server kept our drinks full and was very friendly. We definitely plan on coming here again."}
{"text":"be aware of false advertising. My girlfriend and I shared a baby back rack of ribs with all you can eat coleslaw and beans. I asked for an extra helping of the sides and was told no, as we were sharing the meal. There was no mention of this before we ordered or listed on the menu. The waitress was very rude. We share meals many times at other restaurants with no limitations on the menu. Never going back....."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. For the price of a large sandwich 10.00 you get one small piece of meat on a small roll, I would hate to see the regular. The meat was dry. I"}
{"text":"Good food great staff Kylie waited on us could not ask for better service BBQ off the hook good"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Very good food! We ordered take out and the serving sizes are huge for the price. Everyone must try the fried Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This place has gone completely downhill over the past couple of years.  We used to frequent this place 1-3 times a week. Then I don't know what happened but all of a sudden no Texas toast, ribs are always always out, charge for BBQ sauce, no more mini deserts, and no add on meats to complete dinners. So disappointing.  They've lost us as customers."}
{"text":"If you like barbecue, search no further. Great atmosphere. Great barbecue sauce!!! Ribs are fall of the bones delicious, literally. Brisket is smoked to perfection with a beautiful caramelizing crust.  Definitely enjoyed the Super Sampler. Great way to start if you can't decide what to pick. You get a little bit of everything!"}
{"text":"Visited the original Waldo's on Main St. in Mesa. Extremely casual BBQ decor, sawdust on the ground- booths and tables everywhere. There's a \"bar\" up front and they have full service options with beer and well drinks. The staff was friendly, greeting us as our party walked through the door. Our server was nice as well, checking in on us several times to make sure we were happy.  The food is just okay. I ordered the smoked chicken and it was a bit fatty with mixture white and dark meat It was a decent portion served with two homemade side dishes. There are plenty of sides to choose from- I went with the spicy fried and mac n' cheese. The fries were undercooked and were doused with some sort of seasoning that I guess was supposed to be spicy? The mac n' cheese was also ho-hum, elbow macaroni with very \"soupy\" cheese sauce- not much flavor. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to give it some taste. We were only served one type of BBQ sauce- it was a little sweet and served warm.   The prices are definitely reasonable- I paid $7.95 for 1/3 pound meat and the two sides, which are endless servings (only one order for me though). Sodas were served in giant mason jars- adding to the country vibe.   I'd try Waldo's again- give some other sides a shot and maybe give their ribs a try. The service helped the overall experience."}
{"text":"I love BBQ. I love BBQ sauce. I LOVE THE ORIGINAL WALDO'S BBBQ!!!  Here's why.  Their sampler, which I ordered, includes moist pulled smoked chicken, sliced moist beef brisket, and Pulled smoked Beef, topped with a warm skillet of BBQ sauce??? Forget about it.  I'm in heaven.  Accompanied by an ice cold local beer and the Naughty Palmer?? Stick a fork in me-I'm done!!  All you can eat sides like spicy fries and coleslaw, combined with my wife's sides of green chili Mac and cheese and horsey spuds?  You can't go wrong my friend!!  The best part is that they treat you like family. We reconnected with a server who remembered us back when my wife was pregnant with my youngest daughter-13 years ago!!  Life is all about building relationships and they built one with my family.   Good food + good family + good times!!"}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ place in the east valley so far. This southern girl is picky and have looked years for a decent place. We have been here twice now. Love the kids eat free on Wednesdays. I had the brisket lunch special. Was really tasty and I like the BBQ sauce. Staff is friendly and the shop next door reminds me of the old time Stuckey's and all the road trips I took with my parents."}
{"text":"Meh... Seems to be a local icon, but the food wasn't horrible, but not great either. I think the side dishes were  better than the BBQ. Service was excellent, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I do not know what the one reviewer considers \"overpriced\" but this place is not.  I have been eating here for years, and the food is pretty good. The pulled pork is my favorite, and the Catfish Po'Boy is also really good, I order it on a normal bun instead of the Baguette.  They also have unlimited side items.. I typically have a small pulled pork with baked potato, the cost is around 7-8 bucks with drink and cornbread, and I usually have two baked potatoes, which is a good deal in my book.  My best friend is a fan of the brisquet, yet I have not tried it.  The place is quite decked out with pig related stuff, but don't worry, its just decor, the staff is quite friendly and attentive. My vegetarian fiance will even eat there (side items are good!) and they have always accommodated her."}
{"text":"New location. We came on opening day. People are very friendly and nice! Restaurant decor is fun. My table and chair were a bit out of balance, but it's a barbecue place, I wasn't too bothered by it. I had the St. Louis ribs and they were good, but a tad over cooked. Side baked potato had a $2 up charge to get it loaded, but it was a huge potato and they don't skip on the cheese, bacon and sour cream...personally I would have seen more butter, but I could have asked for it if it was that important. I also had a salad with blu-cheese dressing and that dressing was amazing!  The worst of this other wise decent lunch was it took longer than expected to get our food. The only reason I'm holding back from 4 stars is the over cooked ribs. I will probably be back as it was over all a good experience!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not very good. Meat and BBQ sauce were lukewarm at best. Pulled pork had a grainy texture to it, and the corn bread had very little flavor. Our waitress was fantastic though so two stars for her. Oh the sweet tea is really good too. I can't believe this place has 4 stars"}
{"text":"So good! We had the green chili macaroni and cheese, baked potato (which was perfect), fried okra, pulled pork sandwich, ham platter and drinks. We were stuffed. But man I wanted dessert, so we got some mason jar cheesecake, based on our server Scott's recommendation!   Delicious, great service and to go dessert!  Yum and thank you, Scott!"}
{"text":"It the Real Deal BBQ. Not fancy, just real good BBQ served in a country casual place."}
{"text":"First let's discuss the order. I would've understood the order being messed up if they were busy, but I was the only one in the restaurant at the time I placed the order. I ordered a three meat platter plus which included ribs. Skyler came out with the order he quickly went through it and showed it to me. I got home and started to take out the meat and put it on a plate and suddenly realized that the turkey was missing. I called and spoke to Skyler to let him know that the turkey was missing. He tried to explain to me where the turkey was in the order and I informed him that all I had was ribs, brisket and pulled pork. He offered to fix the order if I wanted to drive back to the store and take care of it. I told him I'm not sure that I will come back to the store because of this mixup. He informed me he would let the master Cook know that they forgot the turkey on the order.  Now let's talk about the food, the sauce is something to be desired it was very vinegary with very little flavor. The brisket was OK the ribs were a little bit better (if you want better ribs go next door to Blue 32) but the pulled pork just was lifeless. Most of this was just very bland and taste and poor quality of food. However I would put the quality of food just a little bit above famous Dave's. I don't like famous Dave's very much. It is over priced process food.   I may return one more time to give them another shot but only if i don't want famous Dave's.   It is a shame that we can't get better barbecue closer to the Santan mall then famous Dave's and waldo's barbecue. At least I can get good ribs at Blue 32."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, fast friendly service.. Mac and cheese is some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"By far the BEST beef back ribs I've ever had!! I got a few orders of the beef ribs in addition to delicious sides to-go, first time here and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met my boyfriend here on my lunch break. I have seen this place every day since working in east Mesa and we finally went. It was great!! Super divey, large open space, nice staff and good BBQ. The chicken was smoked and was excellent. I got it on top of my salad. Portion size was huge, the BBQ sauce excellent and the complimentary cornbread while nothing to write home about, I di like the jalapeno bite in the cornbread...good.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich, Memphis style with coleslaw on it. The slaw came on the side instead of on it so her didn't eat it, I tried the slaw and it was good. His pulled pork sandwich I wish I could write about the flavors etc but he ate it all, and loved every bite. So I guess it's good :)  Cheap food, good food, cheap drinks, full bar and nice friendly service along with a quirky souvenir shop, (the shop is closed on Sundays). Really great and no complaints here!   I am sure we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere good food and service"}
{"text":"Waldo's is a place you have to try if you are in the Mesa/Gilbert area.  The setting has a kitchy somewhat campy theme inside and out.  It's kind of like a Route 66 diner but much better. The ceiling is painted with clouds and the restaurant is very open.  I think they might even have a back room also.    Your choices on BBQ are plentiful and the endless sides are a total bonus, even though buy the time you're done with your dinner, ordering more on the sides doesn't usually happen for me.     Last time I was there I got the pulled chicken.  What is mouth watering is the sauce they used.  They put it in a little skillet and you can use as little or as much as you like.  The tanginess of the sauce with a little bit is just what you want from a BBQ.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The service every time we come to Waldo's has been excellent.  You can't beat the value and service.  Every time I am here, I always say I wonder why this place hasn't been on Diners, Drive-In's & Dives."}
{"text":"The ribs are A-mazing, and the sauce is very good.  Skip the chicken - it's always dried out.  The fries are hand cut and delicious too though, and everyone there is very friendly."}
{"text":"What happened?  I have to change my rating from five stars. When they first opened the food was great. Two weeks in row, now, the take out order of the full rack of baby ribs have been....dry, dry, dry -- like chewing leather.  I had to drown the ribs in sauce to make it slightly decent to swallow. Maybe it's the takeout and I'm getting the less than desirable portions. Too bad I won't be returning there soon. I guess it's a good time to go vegan."}
{"text":"Thankfully I read the not recommended reviews before eating here. The food was amazing - fresh and flavorful.  Service was efficient and friendly. We will be back. Don't understand why the good reviews aren't in recommended reviews."}
{"text":"But I'm a picky eater so when I came to visit friends in Arizona I asked him what would be a good barbecue place I thought the food was dry service was slow I will never return."}
{"text":"Love it, love it! The food is sooo good!!! You just got to come over!! Happy hour is awesome!! The service, atmosphere and live music is totally enjoyable. You leave feeling totally satisfied. The humor in the house will keep you laughing."}
{"text":"Always drive past here finally decided to stop. It was very good. Enjoyed the super sampler the ribs are to die for just fell off the bone. Pretty friendly waiter."}
{"text":"Waldo's BBQ is a must visit restaurant.   I ordered Th Pig, large size.  Generous helpings of pulled pork and delete city's Waldo's BBQ sauce on the side.  My baked potato was perfectly cooked.   Good, friendly service.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am from hog country, Arkansas, where we fashion our hellos and sports calls on the sooooouuiiee noise of the hogs. Waldo's makes me feel like I'm back home, where the tea is sweet, the meat falls gently from the bone, and you put yourself in a food coma with family and friends nearby. You cannot come to waldo's alone - you must bring a friend, family, or even a foe (waldo's will make you best friends). The baby back ribs are divine and the fried okra makes your mouth water. The sweet tea is is served in a mason jar and is sweet nectar of the gods!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in Arizona!  The babyback ribs are a 9 on a scale of 1-10 and the smoked chicken is a 12 on a scale of 1-10.  This place has been consistently amazing for the 20 years I've been in the valley.  I had them cater an event for me last year and they were fabulous.  The servers were good kids who worked hard and everyone was super accommodating to anything I suggested."}
{"text":"Had Waldo cater a party at our house.  We ordered 1/4 chicken and beef brisket as the main course and beans, salad, baked potatoes for the sides. They delivered right on time and everything was the right temperature.  Food was excellent.  The brisket was very lean and the chicken was flavorful.  Love their barbecue sauce.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and absolutely loved the food. Amazing service, personable, and fun atmosphere. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  They will make a gluten free sauce for you.  Generous portions and great food and service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, thanks Gabe!  Had the sampler, 1/2 rack of ribs, and kids meal.  All the food was good."}
{"text":"Recommend their catering services.  They are easy to deal with and their prices are fair and reasonable.  They arrive on time and deliver the food hot and exactly as requested.  We have used them for 30 years for a variety of social events in our back yard; they never disappoint.   Always yummy BBQ.  Brisket is lean and tasty."}
{"text":"Great food.  We ordered the super sampler and an order of wings.  Had BBQ and Jerk sauce for dipping our meat.  I fell in love with the spice Jerk sauce and to my surprise they sell it.  Portions were big so we will enjoy this meal tomorrow.  Oh, they had a fabulous dessert menu but we were to full so we will do dessert on another day.  We highly recommend this place, we will return to it."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, but not amazing. I usually end up with the pork sandwich for lunch and the large is a decent portion with an okay amount of flavor. I end up dousing it in sauce (theirs is good). The sauce, by the way, comes out warm in a tiny cast iron pan (3\" diameter, with a handle). The cornbread comes with a meal, a nice touch, but I'm not personally a fan of the green chiles baked in. Service is okay but isn't memorable. One other food comment - the country ribs have too many bones that break apart making it hard to eat, so steer clear. The restaurant itself is sort of corny with crude and silly signs posted."}
{"text":"This is not barbecue. That's okay because Mesa doesn't really have barbecue. I feel sad for people who think Joes, Waldo's, Tom's etc is good barbecue. First off, the smoked brisket sub at Firehouse typically has more smoke flavor. 2nd they just don't cook their meats right. It reminds me of when I would partially bake my ribs. Maybe it's because they keep them in steam boxes all day or something. Just blah. Fried corn on the cob was tasty though..."}
{"text":"Wow great bbq sauce!!! One of the best bbqs I've ever had!!! Will definitely be coming back multiple times!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to cater from. The service Waldo's BBQ provided to the event I was hosting was absolutely brilliant! I don't live in Arizona, but the event was in Mesa. David and Vicki took the time to truly make my long distance event planning experience wonderful. The night of the event, they should up on time and ready to provide food to a very hungry group of doctors. Everyone loved the food and continued to grab seconds. I love Waldo's BBQ and would highly recommend them to everyone who wants great service and great food! Thank you so much for making the event a great success !"}
{"text":"Just to \"pile on\" here...I recently discovered Waldo's and was surprised at how close to my home they are!  Went there for dinner and loved the food!  Terrific selection of BBQ options, good comfortable atmosphere, and very reasonable prices - just what I was looking for.  Waldo's is my new favorite BBQ in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and I've eaten it all over the country. Food was served hot without much of a wait. Great experience. Try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Today was my third time going there in the last three months. The food is amazing the service is outstanding, and I don't quite understand some of the negativity that I read on here. The fried okra is amazing and the barbecue is very tasty. Can't wait to go there again and bring some of my friends"}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ's I have ever had!!! The cornbread has a nice little kick with green chilies. The meat is so tender that it falls off the bone! The sauce... to die for!!! They have a couple of different varieties my personal favorite is the jerk!! Sweet with a bit of spicy!! This is a must try BBQ!!!!"}
{"text":"So the smell of this place will make your mouth water. However the look and service of it is something to be desired. Some workers have been there for years and are friendly but it's slow service.   This is an amazing Arizona special kind of place and if you passing through or want to give it a try, definitely go for it! It will always deserve that first try and maybe like a few times a year but it is not a regular place to go for dinner. They serve drinks! A bomb Bloody Mary and cherry moonshine you must try! Also they have great cheesecakes in a mason jar! Get the cheesecake in a mason jar!"}
{"text":"We got takeout the other night. It was ready in 15 minutes. That's awesome in itself.   Got 2 samplers, one with the ¼ rack of ribs. The ribs literally fall off the bone. The sauce is great. Brisket was tender and fell apart too. Chicken and pork was delicious and moist. Sides were the \"horsey spuds\" mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, sweet potato chips and mac and cheese. The mac n cheese even had bacon in it and was definitely not Kraft! Everything was delicious. The only suggestion I'd make is put some sugar or salt on the sweet potato chips, and more horseradish in the potatoes.  I also was delighted that they thought of EVERYTHING; BBQ and corn were in tinfoil so they were still hot when we got home, plenty of BBQ sauce, silverware, napkins, and they even remembered to put in butter for the corn.   We usually do Lucille's but we got 3x as much food here for the same price. Score.  The restaurant inside looked really laid-back, 'country, and like a quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars, but I had to give it at least 1. The food came in small portions, and was severely bland. The meat was smoked, but still not tender and lacked luster in the seasoning department. The brisket was dry and all of my meat except the chicken was Luke warm. I ordered the chicken strips, and the sampler plate. The only thing I appreciated about this meal, was the chicken strips, and the horsey potatoes, they were the saving grace. The hostess was great, but later saw her on the phone texting and wrapping utensils right across from our table with the waitress we had. The waitress was absolutely horrible, never smiled, and had no personality. She should definitely not be working in food service. This is the first time and last time I will ever eat here. No wonder the receipt begs if you find a better BBQ place, please still eat here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Nothing is better than having amazing food and awesome service! Ordered in and had our food ready as soon as we arrived. They went over and showed us our order to make sure everything was correct. No one likes to get home and realize their order is wrong lol. They have a full bar and great beer (the Amber Bock is a must try). I had their sweet potato fries, Mac and cheese, and their Waldo sandwich with beef brisket and pulled chicken."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Waldo's BBQ.  Now that Waldo's has a location in Gilbert I am able to get my Waldo's fix way more often. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The brisket is tender and amazing. Never a shortage of BBQ sauce here.  Running low...server brings more.  Go ahead and drowned that BBQ if you are so inclined.  Portions are very generous. So much so that you won't be able to order deserts and will take a box home for a nice BBQ lunch the next day.  The atmosphere is fun and friendly just like the Mesa location. The patio is the highlight. Large with misters and additional bar seating on the patio. Bar offers excellent drinks including the moonshine mixed cocktails that will be sure to put a smile on you!  Thanks Waldo's Gilbert."}
{"text":"Yet another wonderful meal at Waldo's. This for sure is our go to for BBQ dinners. Their sauce is so good you almost want to eat it with a spoon. The unlimited sides are a blessing with three hungry boys and the wait staff are great. Scott was our server tonight and he really made my sons birthday meal feel special."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a mid week lunch. The place wasn't crowded but I waited 15 minutes for someone to take my order. Got my food quickly but it was very dry. Many better BBQ places around."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio. My wife's sat on the bench wall and it was very uncomfortable for her. We sat there for 5-10 minutes waiting for someone to even take our drink order. I finally had to get up and go get a waiter.  Getting the food out was just as slow. We had seen the great reviews about the brisket. So we ordered the brisket dinner, and the super sampler with pulled pork, hot link, brisket, and the dry ribs.  The ribs were the best part of the meal. The pulled pork came in second, then the hot link, and finally the brisket in dead last. Perhaps I'm a little picky of my brisket, but I expect bark and a wonderful smoke ring and smokey flavor. The ring was barely there. The brisket was so lean it had no flavor and was not very tender.  Sides we had okra, potato salad, fried corn on the cob, and Cole slaw. The corn tasted old, the Cole slaw and potato salad was no different than something I'd get in a grocery store deli. The okra was the only thing that shined. My southern bell wife devoured it.  Maybe I just like a different style of BBQ, but I would not come back to this establishment. If you like mediocre BBQ then you will be fine"}
{"text":"Ribs and chicken tonight.  If your in Mesa and looking for smoked bbq?  Try their Famous ribs.  Easy to find on Main St.  They offer combos to satisfy your taste buds.  All you can eat sides even!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to try the Waldo's BBQ near us in Gilbert. It's in a nice location and the service and the people are extremely nice. The meal was just bland though, I've had Waldo's at the Mesa location and it had more flavor. The appetizers are just ok, the meat was not up to par, the one bright spot was the fried catfish. I hope to come back when it's better."}
{"text":"Ok, so we have been searching high and low for a great BBQ place in the east valley... and we have found hog heaven!  Waldo's BBQ is a beautiful blend of amazing food, roadside authentic ambiance, and servers like Scott... who make the place a definite 5 Star, must try in the Valley!   We're leaving high on the hog, full to the brim and happier than a pig in slop!"}
{"text":"Had dinner over here for the first time and it was absolutely amazing! Gabe was our waiter and he did amazing. Always refilling our drinks and asking if we needed anything. I had the baked potato with pulled pork and it was divine. Super tasty! Can't wait to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"Everything in this place has changed.  We've given it several chances in the past couple of years and it just hasn't worked out.  The food isn't nearly as good as it had been, not by a long shot. Service has always been iffy imo. I used to consider this place a \"must try\", now a \"must avoid\"."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is always excellent. I always make sure to have some of their brisket being it is one of the best I have had. Their service and sides are as awesome as their meats. I will definitely be back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of flavor. Love the green chili cornbread. A little slow getting drinks but the food made up for that. Try the fried corn!!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! I got a brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries and my friend got Barbe-Cuban with potato wedges. All was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have ever tasted. Not a fancy place, but well kept up and well worth the day trip to east freaking Mesa.  Everything on the menu is fantastic - I have tried it all over the years :)  Place gets kinda busy around traditional lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Good food.  Fabulous waitress!  We went for a live band event.  Didn't know about this place. The atmosphere was fun and the decor had us laughing. I had the nachos (I know, I know, a BBQ place and I got nachos). I was intrigued with the description. They used real cheese not the cheese with a shelf life of 20 years (not that I don't like it sometimes).  BBQ pork nachos are the bomb!  I was pleasantly surprised. The BBQ sauce wasn't spicy but tasty and on the sweeter side which I love. Our waitress (Kelley) was fantastic!  We never saw the bottom of our drinks. She made sure our order was correct. She was extremely attentive and funny. All the wait staff we had contact with was personable and funny which was refreshing. Very positive experience. We will be returning. Thank you for a fun day out Waldo's BBQ!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here tonight with some friends. The street tacos were very good and the peach cobbler is delicious. Gabe was our server and he was AMAZING! We will defiantly be back. Thanks Gabe!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq joint to come to in AZ.  Been going to this place for years back when it was the only place around that far on Main St.  The food is always good and unlimited sides are super good!  I love the corn bread and horsey spuds!  Give this place a go if your looking for some bbq!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance, and I'm so glad I did!  The service has greatly improved, and is now almost as phenomenal as the food itself.  We've since made Waldo's a regular meeting place, which is really just an excuse to order their signature Hay Stack on a regular basis.  If you're looking for authentic, home-style barbecue, they're pretty much the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"Best ribs I have ever had.  Pulled pork and fried corn was excellent as well.  Very reasonably priced, and it has a fun atmosphere as well.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in over the weekend. I ordered the Barbecuban sandwich (pulled pork, pit ham, swiss, pickles, & dijon). The sandwich came with a side and I ordered a salad. My father ordered a meat platter. They gave us our iced teas in large mason jars which was really cute. They also had an alcohol menu. The server was very nice. She was attentive to us the who time and offered to give us to go cups for our teas. I felt the sandwich was a little small for the price but I will definitely return in the future.   Laid back environment Friendly Staff Great food"}
{"text":"I am giving the food 5 stars because it honestly is an excellent restaurant and the experience we had doesn't justify leaving a low star rating. Saturday the wife and I wanted to get an appetizer and possibly dessert after working in the yard most of the day. We were in sweats and sports jerseys..clean but not dressed up. Went in around 6 pm.. waitress we had not seen before walks up and looks down her nose at us from the start.. seemed irritated we ordered water and an appetizer. Food comes out and we ask for ranch. She grunts and walks off. Usually when we eat out it is for lunch and we are dressed up so I am possibly used to better treatment for that reason.. but I was starting to get angry. 5 minutes go by as she stands around behind the counter. Our waters sit empty. Another 5 minutes go by and I waved down a busboy to get a box.. decided to take it home and finish it there. She brings the check with same snotty attitude. Left no tip.. which I have done maybe 1 other time ever.. and told hostesses she shouldn't be working with the public. No name tag but somewhat masculine middle aged brunette. Have attemped to reach management with no success. She will affect their bottom line.. we can't be the only ones she has treated badly. Again..excellent food. Will return at lunch time. If management cares about this I have emailed them privately on Facebook."}
{"text":"This barbecue joint has been here forever and deserves to continue serving good basic 'cue. One of the few places that serve beef ribs, really good ones. Another specialty fried corn. The coleslaw is exceptional and they keep it coming. Baked potatoes are another nice item, and pork wings. The sauce is not so central as in many restaurants, but it's quite good. The decor is divey with wood shavings on the floor and white paper table coverings. My one negative was the onion stack, which was served only slightly above room temperature."}
{"text":"One of my favorite BbQ places. Staff is always pleasant and helpful. The pulled pork is awesome and I would always recommend the Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The brisket is SO smokey and has a really nice visible smoke ring in the meat. The sweet potato fries are to die for and my baked potato was even great as well! Scott is one hell of a nice guy and an even better waiter. Major props to Waldo's!"}
{"text":"Well me being me I wasn't much paying attention to anything other than my conversation with my friend. The waitress came over to take our order, I said I'd take the days special, it was a dollar up-charge for a breast piece so I had one of those a thigh and a certain 2 side items. There was two different lists I guess for side items, not realizing the side items I got were on the not free refill list. I'm from Minnesota and have the stupid Minnesota nice thing when I deal with well, most people. The food was brought out and there was a leg, I simply made mention of it, she then removed it with her bare hands... Hope you threw it away because I really doubt your hands were that clean, but that's just me. I'm actually deaf in one ear and half deaf from several explosions in Iraq but my friend said they were mocking me over the counter as far as the thigh. It took close to 7 minutes to get me the piece of chicken, and to be quite honest it didn't taste very good, like it was done intentionally. It was the special of the day, should have been quick and easy. It had been probably 5 months since the last time I was there, and it is going to have to be a bit chilly in hell before I go back.  I don't care about the wrong food, but to mock someone that you are waiting on who is being nice to you even though you only seem to be doing a half-assed job at YOUR JOB. And it was so busy at 2:30 in the afternoon, 6 people including us.  No one should be treated like this, this is no way to run a business. Thank you and good day."}
{"text":"I have come to Waldo's many times, and each time has been delicious and overall a great experience! The few most recent times though have disappointing... One of the times we were not acknowledged when we walked through the door. The hostess didn't look up or smile or say I will be right with you... We had to greet her and let her know we would like a booth. Which she seemed annoyed. She didn't even say 'right this way'. She just started walking away with the menus. The food that night wasn't right. My ribs were bloody. Not pink from being smoked, bloody. I thought maybe just bad timing or a busy night..we left dissatisfied.  We recently went back and I was looking forward to the yummy bbq that can be found here. Well, we walked in and again we stood their until the host finally said hello with no smile and didn't bother to ask how many in our party. I again asked for a booth and there was no acknowledgment of what I said. He took the menus out and walked away leaving us standing there wondering if he was looking for an open table or actually seating us. Our waitress came over for our drinks...she didn't ask how we were or any appetizers. She very hurriedly asked what we want to drink and it felt like there was somewhere else she would rather be than at our table. We never got our complementary cornbread that I was looking forward to. I had to ask about it later... And when we got it it was very thin and very stale. When we placed our order my fiancé got the sampler and I got ribs. I ordered mine to be crispy on the outside and also to come wet. Food arrived and my ribs were dry. There was no sauce on them. I asked if these were wet and the waitress said yes we put them on the grill. Ok...? Still no sauce....?  Both of our food was barely warm also. Whatever. Now we understand that when you smoke meat that it's supposed to be a bit pink inside. My fiancé cut open the link he ordered and it was completely pink. Not smoked pink, way undercooked pink! This made us pretty upset.. We let the waitress know and she went on to say the meat is smoked and is supposed to be pink. There was no apology or taking it back to be cooked a bit longer or comping us for that item. We were frustrated. We decided to try the brownie for dessert. It came out looking pretty scrumptious piled high with whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate. You couldn't even see the brownie. We were thinking that it was something finally right that we could fully enjoy. Wrong. Underneath the whipped cream and ice cream was the smallest piece of a brownie...not even slightly warm! We both looked closer and realized that it was a store bought brownie! It had icing on it...   I for one am so disappointed in the whole experience I've had here, twice! I know how amazing this place used to be. The customer service used to be welcoming and laid back...the food used to be perfect...perfect flavor perfect portions perfect everything. Sadly, this last go was our last time coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service - always our go too place when we need some BBQ. Potato wedges are fantastic and grilled veggies are uniquely delicious!! Our server Skylar is also amazing and attentive and made our experience very special."}
{"text":"I come to Waldo's once a year when I'm in town for spring training games. My buddy lives nearby, so it's a no-brainer to come here for great pork bbq. I love the horseradish mashed potatoes. Service takes a while sometimes, but by the end of the meal, with a full belly, that is all forgotten.  A plus is the gift shop next door."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times over the years with bad results (after the year when the parking lot was stinking of sewage all the time I really did not want to go any more) but a friend wanted to try it so I went. -earsplitting noise from all hard surfaces in a small room -everything is so tired out and dusty right down to the dried out as a bone hand wipes -his ribs were fairly good nothing great -I am mostly vegetarian and had a Caesar salad with faux chicken strips which was okay  -the sides were absolutely gross, barely warm veggies soaked in grease and dried out burned sweet potato fries -Servers although they were polite clearly wanted you out-worse than a fast food restaurant:,our server forgot a few small things we asked for although that was not the biggest deal ever. Do not go."}
{"text":"this is my 2nd favorite bbq joint! they give u enough food for leftovers. not your typical franchise bbq joint"}
{"text":"I want to rate this place 5 stars because when I first started eating here - six or so years ago, it truly was.   I still crave this place sometimes and go (less than before). The service, except one waitress whose name escapes me, woman with dark hair, is lousy.   My biggest peeve, though, is the inconsistency. I used to be able to know exactly what my tea would taste like, how the Bbq would be (taste and quality) and it's completely different every time, now.   Don't get me started on the cornbread. It was always a little hit or miss, but now, it's either perfect it tastes like it's days old. I still give this place props, but I don't know how you can make one of my favorite foods taste so horribly."}
{"text":"So I was starving and in the area, so I stopped in again on a tip from a friend that their ribs were \"delicious dude\".  I figured I would give it one more chance, and I'm glad I did.  Their baby back ribs are actually VERY good.  I was shocked.  Their ribs trump Joe's by a long shot.  The rest of their food is \"meh\" but the ribs are dank."}
{"text":"we are here from California visiting family, and my nephew chose Waldos knowing my husband love BBQ. We were not disappointed! This place was great!!! Great family restaurant, lots of positive energy, very friendly staff, our waitress was very busy but gave us extremely good service. We ordered ribs, chicken, hotlinks, pork sampler which was devoured by the men.  We also enjoyed pulled pork sandwich, BBQ sauce brought on a mini frying pan, potato stuffed with pulled pork, and kiddie plate chicken strips, all delish!! Excellant cherry lemonade, have to order!! all drinks served in mason jars. Lots of different signs, ecclectic wall hanging, Pigs, things to look at while enjoying a fun night out. Try Waldos, you wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for 12 years now.  Since the new ownership took over and changed the menu around a bit, I'm not such a fan.  However...  The pulled pork is STILL some of the best around.  I have had pulled pork in 49 states ( yes, you can even get it in Alaska ) and I rank Waldos in my top 5.  The free jalapeño cornbread is good too."}
{"text":"Once again Waldo's BBQ was awesome! The food was so yummy & the service was awesome! David took such good care of us! Love, love this place! You should make it a point to try it!"}
{"text":"First visit to Waldo's. We found it to be a very down to earth place to eat. Staff was friendly and food was tasty. The ice tea came in a mason jar and was kept filled without asking.   Our party started with onion rings as an appetizer. It was a huge portion, more than 4 people could eat.  They looked and smelled amazing. My husband described the onion rings as awesome.  The sweet potato with chicken on it was great. Never would have imagined how good that could be. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, very casual restaurant with good food Waldo's is the place to go."}
{"text":"If I had not been to the Mesa location, my expectations would not have been so high. To be fair the menu and quality are identical, the service not so much. We did get our free soft drink for checking in on Yelp. We arrived on a Sunday for lunch. We were seated immediately. Our waiter took our drink order. It took a while to get them. We placed our order and again we waited. When our food arrived it wasn't very warm. I asked the waiter if the beans were supposed to be cold. He said no, stuck his finger in them, and said he would bring some warm ones. I was hoping he didn't just rewarm the same ones. He did bring a different bowl nice and warm. The Waldo sandwich I ordered was good, but it too wasn't very warm. For the sake of the group and I just dealt with it. Another day may bring a different experience, but this was mine today."}
{"text":"First of all any place that gives check in freebees when you check in on Yelp is ok in my book. We each got a free soft drink when we checked in. We came here for lunch on a Saturday. The place was not too busy. The first thing I noticed even before we were through the door was the smoky barbeque smell. I'm sure many people have walked in salivating with anticipation. We were seated in a booth immediately. Our waiter was actually the catering manager. He spent a few minutes telling us about the place and gave us a little history about Waldo's.   After a few minutes I decided to order the brisket sandwich with a side order of beans. Bye the way, all the sides are unlimited so you can literally make a pig of yourself. Our food was out in a reasonable amount of time. Our order came with a nice piece of fresh baked corn bread, which was very good. It also came with a mini-skillet full of homemade barbeque sauce. This sauce is out of this world good. I was tempted to take the straw from my drink and drink the sauce. The brisket was tender and smoky. By itself it was pretty ordinary, but the sauce made my sandwich juicy and savory. The beans were good also. I spooned some barbeque sauce in those as well.  The restaurant itself is showing signs of age. The ceiling is cracked, and the outside could use a new coat of paint. I think it works well if they are trying for a roadhouse ambiance. I am not a big fan of wood chips or peanut shells on the floor. The walls are adorned with funny little signs and sayings. The ceiling is painted sky blue with white clouds painted on it. They have painted pigs in airplanes in such a way as the ceiling fans look like the propellers. I thought it was cute, \"when pigs fly\".  This is a place we'll come back to for sure. I just don't know what took us so long to stop in here before this. We got a take out menu and a catering menu which is something to consider for a party."}
{"text":"BEST BBQ EVERRRRRR!!!!!! It's without a doubt the best bbq I have ever had! The baby back ribs are the best but the pulled chicken is very smoky and tasty too! The barbecue sauce is tangy and smoky and has such a unique flavor! The onion rings are huge and crispy. And the RANCH is so freakin good. It's a great family place with huge portions in a relaxed atmosphere. The prices are reasonable especially since you get unlimited sides. It's a hidden mesa gem and my favorite bbq place ever!"}
{"text":"Friendly service - though a bit forgetful and slow. We thought the meat trio was excellent. Really tender juicy and a nice smoky flavor I love that they give you so many bbq sauce options, all were very good.  The sides were just ok, but the meat made up for it. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try after the place we had reservations for lost our reservation and said we would have to wait over an hour.  What a great thing that turned out to be!  We were worried about going so late...it was already 8:15 and they close at 9-and I've seen too many movies (think Waiting). When we walked in the female staff person seemed a bit irked but she sat us anyway.  We ordered the fried mac and cheese. It came out still frozen.  Scott, the waiter, promptly fixed them.  When they came back out they were super delicious! For my entree I ordered the sampler, in which I chose pulled pork, pulled beef, and turkey and my two sides were potato salad and fried corn on the cob (apparently that's a thing).  When my order came out, it wasn't exactly right - the turkey was replaced with brisket- but I tend to speak very softly so I assume he didnt hear me right. Regardless, what I got was way too much food anyway so I wasn't worried about it.. My husband ordered the brisket with a baked potato and sweet potato fries. As hard as we tried, we didn't come close to finishing all of the food.    Now, I know at this point you're wondering how this place gets 5 stars when I received frozen food and a wrong order... Well because the food is that damn good! The meat was great. The potato salad (on which I'm a stickler) was super good.  The fried corn and the sweet potato fries were out of this world!   What a great anniversary dinner! (Far better than the reservation only place we were supposed to eat). We are definitely going back, for sure!"}
{"text":"I love dinner at Waldo's. The barbecue is great - my favorite is the sliced brisket! Love the atmosphere - terrific patio with water/fire feature. The beer selection here is extensive and the staff are super friendly. Shout out to our server, Kylie. Tonight there is live music - Texas blues. Great evening to share with family!"}
{"text":"We came to Waldos during lunch when it wasn't too crowded.  For some reason it felt like they went out to the farm to get fresh food and start the whole butchering process.  We have a limited time we can go out for lunch, and it took almost 1 hour for the food to come.  While the quality of the food was great, I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Menu prices online are old and do not match current pricing.  Approx. 20% higher prices than what is online.  The Pig (pork) is very good and tender.  The Brisket...not so much.  The pound of brisket was mostly tough, fatty pieces, and flavorless.  No hint of seasoning whatsoever and very bland.  For their high prices I want great, tender flavorful meat.  Not to disguise with sauce.  Sauce is to compliment, not be the only taste.  They have lost my business.  I work hard for my money only to waste it on this place. Buh-bye!"}
{"text":"This was a Yelp find...and it lived up to the great reviews. Best BBQ I've had in a long time!! True family style meals that were fairly priced and VERY good. I had the pulled chicken salad and my buddy had the ribs. Both were OUTSTANDING.   Forget the chains....this mom and pop is the real deal!!"}
{"text":"The Tennessee Sampler is far more than a \"sampler\". I still had some leftover for tomorrow's lunch."}
{"text":"Had the Super Sampler which came with 3 meats and a quarter rack of ribs. Ribs fell off the bone and was very good. I think ribs were a little over done because I like a little tug on the meat to get it off the bone. The rest of the meal was spot on!!!  Love their vegetables with the dry rub on it.  I would go back there next time I am Mesa Arizona. Waiter staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were as advertised...fall off the bone.  Overall reasonably good.  Green chili cornbread (or whatever was in it) not my thing.  Potato salad was pedestrian at best...not bad, not good.  Cole slaw had no flavor beyond cabbage.  I found it to be a bit pricy.  Also, when I went back to the bathroom to wash my hands it had to be north of 100 degrees in that part of the restaurant.  Not sure what's up with that."}
{"text":"We went to Waldo's with some friends who dine there regularly. Monday is all you can eat Riblet night so that's what we had. They had a nice Smokey flavor and they start you off with 4 pieces before you have to make the all you can eat yes/no decision. I'm a hearty eater and honestly I was full  after eating those 4. I'll try the brisket next time.  The bread pudding was good but I'd recommend the peach cobbler if you have the room for it.  The service was outstanding and dining outside was terrific."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to come for real BBQ. Dining experiences are always good with friendly servers. Our latest visit, Scott was our server and he made sure we were well taken care of. We also love to use Waldo's to cater our holiday parties... our guests always show when they know Waldo's is on the menu."}
