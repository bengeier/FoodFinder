{"text":"Best buffalo chicken tenders I've had! Ask for Shaun or Jenn."}
{"text":"Cedar Street Tavern is a fun place to go and be around friends!  We compare it to the old TV show Cheers.  If you have been there before, they remember you.  The staff is super friendly.  We like to go Monday nights and listen to the music!"}
{"text":"Lunch service is fast and friendly. Cuban sandwich is a winner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and a couple beers because it was close to the hotel I was staying at.  Friendly neighborhood bar/restaurant. had the Cuban sandwich and a couple of Sammy Bostons. Food was good, they have a pretty wide ranging menu. Apps to steaks. Tables on the sidewalk outside for us smokers and those that prefer to dine and drink outside.  Good vibe as a local joint. You can tell that it's a \"local\" meet and drink place.   Enough TV's to enjoy a game and live music as well. Highly recommended if you want to grab a couple of beers and have a reasonably priced decent meal."}
{"text":"This is within walking distance from where I work.  It's decent for a quick lunch, nothing special.  Seems like a nice little neighborhood bar great for having some beer & catching a game.  It wasn't busy and the food came out in good time.  The waitress charged me for extra guac when I actually received extra sour cream...I'm sure the price difference wasn't that much so I didn't say anything.  I will come back it just didn't blow me away.  Solid 3.5"}
{"text":"Will NOT come back here.  I went here for lunch today with colleagues.  Service was extremely rude and slow.  It took us an hour to get our food, and the waitress was nowhere to be found throughout that hour.  We were ended up giving her our credit cards at the same time she was bringing our food, because it had taken so long and we needed to get back to work.  Waitress was rude and surly.  I wish I had caught her name.  She had short, very dark hair.  To add insult, there was an automatic 20% gratuity added because we were a party of 6.  If I had had time, I would have asked to speak to a manager to report the waitress and have the tip removed.  I will not return to this restaurant.  Shame on management, for allowing this slow, poor service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food, great drinks and overall great service. The atmosphere is always great and every employee is super friendly. Faith by far is my favorite no shade to anyone else, she's just been my server most of the time. Highly recommended is you want a chill good time. Enjoy everyone!!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today....the restaurant was not busy.  We waited about 15 - 20 min for our food.  A wrap, a sandwich and a burger.  When the order finally came out it was barely warm.  Our waitress was not very good.  She didn't check on us and when one of us went to the bar to ask if we could get a refill, our waitress came poured a refill of water in one of our glasses and there was a bug on the ice.  We brought it to her attention she never apologized just said \"Oh yeah\" picked up the glass and brought out a new glass.  Myself and the other person never got a refill.  My first visit and definitely my last!"}
{"text":"Cedar Street is a great place to get a bite to eat for happy hour. I have personally had almost everything on the menu, except the entrees. The crab dip is AMAZING! The service is a little slow but they are nice.  If you are looking for great drink specials in downtown charlotte this is the place. almost everynight they have a selection of $2 beers. If you are looking for a nice resturant for a sitdown experience, this is not the place. It really is a tavern and has tavern food. If you are looking for a good time at a reasonable price, Cedar Street is a safe bet. Remember the Crab Dip"}
{"text":"Came to Trivia Night on Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, food, beer selections and overall good vibe. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte.  Their food exceeds expectation, especially for the price.  They always have great drink specials. The service is consistently friendly and the atmosphere is inviting.   They also have live music and trivia several nights during the week.   It's not the best spot to watch a game, but they have several TVs so you can still get that done if you want I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Benedict. Lightly fried chicken breast served on a warm biscuit with sliced grilled tomato, two fried eggs topped with \"Country Gravy\" Phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for after work drinks! I go here during the wk for their discounted appetizers from 4 to 6 and great drink specials. Memories of their nachos and quesadillas have been imprinted in my mind. You get a good mix of people from BofA peeps to J&W students to everything in between. I love the atmosphere of this place---dimmed lighting, wrap around bar, music loud enough to rock out to yet not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation. The bartenders are quick with a pour which is a plus in my world since I don't like waiting for my hooch. You can dine inside or out (and bring your dog if you are outside). I wouldn't dedicate a night entirely to this place as the crowd dims down around prime going out time but this is a great starting point or if you're looking to have a cold one after work."}
{"text":"Came in with my co workers... Order a steak quesadilla.  Most quesadilla comes on white but not at this tavern. It's wheat!  So, steak and cheese quesadilla on wheat. Let's just say, that's not the best choice off the menu.  Our waiter, probably the owner or manager, made a comment saying they only have wheat bread.  Strange but that's not stated on the menu.  Thought this was a safe order for a tavern but it's a fail. With bad customer service, I won't be returning.    So long Cedar Tavern..."}
{"text":"Not sure when they got so bad.  Waitress was unfriendly.  They nickel and dime you to death.  My last time here for sure...."}
{"text":"I came in to the Cedar St., Tavern to get a burger for lunch. Despite being the only one there, service took 20 minutes post-order to get my meal, which ended up being under cooked. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"After a wedding, my friend and I returned to our hotel pretty hungry. We asked at the front desk for anything nearby and the Cedar Street Grill was within walking distance.   This is pretty much a bar, but it was nice and airy. There are high ceilings and isolated booths. This is kind of a neighborhood bar in an area you wouldn't expect. The crowd wasn't too rowdy but it seemed like a bunch of locals who knew each other. It wasn't very busy for a Saturday night but it wasn't dead either. Many people were at the outside tables since it was such a nice night.  They serve food pretty late into the night which is great. The menu consists mostly of bar food, but it was good. I had a turkey burger and it was good. It was nothing stellar but it was good.  The service was good too. Our server was attentive and got us our food quickly.  If you need food late at night and you're in the area, this is a safe bet."}
{"text":"OK heres the deal...I went here on a sunday just to watch the 2nd half of the football game....Ordered a picture of beer, got 1 clean glass and 1 dirty glass...STRIKE 1......ordered the crabdip app....1 clean plate 1 dirty plate....STRIKE2.....Also ordered the prime rib sub....just not good...My friend ordered a steak sub...the sub was 5 inch long and just DRY....STRIKE 3....I hated to leave without tipping,,,,but this was one of the WORST places Ive EVER been to........"}
{"text":"The TVs are not setup very appropriately for all parties to see. The burger was slightly above average (could have made it myself) but the sweet potato fries were very good. The service was good but it was a pretty average experience for me. 4/5 of the guys I went with enjoyed their food. Can't complain about $2 bud lights though. Also, my Bloody Mary was rather tasty."}
{"text":"I love Cedar Street but I am a little biased because I host trivia here every Wednesday night from 7:30-9:30.   It's a combination of trivia questions, image rounds and physical challenges. 1st place gets $25, 2nd gets $15 and 3rd gets $10 AND you can use your winnings on alcohol... I have yet to find another bar that lets you use your winnings on booze.   Drink specials are $3 import and micro-brew bottles, $4 Jagger and Firefly shots and $6 Jagger-bombs.  Shaun the bartender is great and we have lots of fun. OK, I am done with the shameless plug."}
{"text":"Life is pretty good when you come across places like these. No B.S. tavern where the food is good, cheap and so are the beers. It's a spot for the none poser crowds just wanna sit down, grub out and slam a couple of beers. Then shoot the breeze and have some real good times with real good friends.     If you do order the mystery beer, it's like playing random local beer roulette. I mean local as in the beer is sourced not too far away, like in the same state that the establishment is sitting on. It's a cool concept, it's nice to try out some random beer from made just around the corner. Definitely the best way to try something new.     Anyways, our first time here was late so we had their late night menu items. Which consisted mostly of their appetizer selections. I think we ended up ordering 25 wings to share family style that night, along with onion rings, mozzarella sticks and fried pickles. We were allowed to choose 3 different sauces on the wings. I picked their Lip Kisser sauce since it was the hottest sauce in their arsenal. I decided to give that one a world... Yes it was hot... And NO I wasn't defeated. That sauce I can definitely say, can hold a candle to the Blazin sauce from that commercial wing joint.     Anyways, we also has their Cedar Street burgers the next day and they were very good as well. Server forgot to ask us how we liked our burgers cooked, but that's not a big deal to us. The sweet potato fries are to die for though. Awesome taste, great crispness and it's so much better than potato sticks.     Anyways, come eat here because it's wicked awesome.      Weeeeeeeeeee!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise for our visit to Charlotte. Our hotel recommended this neighborhood place right around the corner.   My wife and I sat at the bar where Shaun took care if us, welcoming us with good conversation and helping us with recommendations from their new menu.   His recommendations based on our hunger level were spot on. Cuban with sweet potato fries (seasoned with cinnamon sugar...mmm) for me and moderately spiced tortilla soup and California salad for my wife. All delicious and delivered timely.  We paused when we walked in, as it seemed more bar than restaurant, but our bellies are more than happy we gave this a shot after first impressions.   Great atmosphere (small groups of guys, girls, couples) sports on 10 TVs, and great service from Shaun. If we don't get back this stay, this will be a first stop on our return."}
{"text":"Only reason I would visit is because it was downstairs from my apartment. Not a bad place to grab a beer and they occasionally have live music. The food is just average bar fare however I must warn - the blue cheese that comes with the wings (and other things) is absolute total crap."}
{"text":"This is more of a neighborhood bar with a laid back atmosphere, decent food and friendly attendants. If you're the young party type you probably won't have much fun here but if you're looking for a weekday drink or to pregame before going Uptown it's great. They have trivia on Wednesday and the ladies that host it are really great. It used to move wayyy too slowly but they seem to be much quicker now. If you live in Third Ward or maybe just staying at the Double Tree for business then check this place out."}
{"text":"Have eaten here before and had no problems but last night I got the wings and I knew there was something suspect. I proceeded to eat them against my better judgement.  Needless to say, I got serious food poisoning and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Happened to be staying around the corner for the weekend and popped in here for a bite of lunch and to cool in the middle of exploring the neighborhood.  Sherri, the bartender and waitress all-in-one was tackling a growing crowd with skill.  I sat near a window to people watch and was quickly greeted and brought a menu and then my drink, which was kept full by the attentive Sherri.  Ordered a simple cheeseburger and French fries.  Both came out hot and delicious a short time later.  The burger was nicely seasoned, I noticed a hint of garlic which was a nice touch.  The fries were great - my favorite kind - the ones that are so bad for you, fries coated in some sort of breading which makes them super crisp and super yummy! I would definitely recommend this spot for a bite to eat and a nice spot to watch some football too."}
{"text":"Tried Cedar Street Tavern on a Saturday evening for burgers. A cool lil neighborhood type tavern with good service, great food and ice cold beer what more could one ask for??? They have many TV's as well as a large projection screen likely a cool place to watch the game, meet friends for drinks and or food. They had very yummy sweet potato fries, OMG!!! I believe they had a li brown sugar and cinnamon on them. We'll for sure be back especially for those yummy fries and burgers."}
{"text":"Cedar street surprisingly has really good food. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that what seemed to be your average pub has really good food. Breakfast is pretty good, but lunch and dinner are very good! The menu has a large variety and they also have an express lunch."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so this place is very convenient for me. Good food, reasonably priced drinks, and good service. A good corner bar if you aren't looking for anything fancy. Happened to be trivia night when we stopped in. Turned out to be a lot if fun!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars is more appropriate but not an option -  The food quality here is hit or miss and that does not necessarily mean from one trip to another.  Most recent I had a Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Sweet Potato Fries,  The Fries were great and much better than the last time I had them.  Sadly the wrap was not good at all.  Normally you would think anything coated in a buffalo wing sauce (if you like that sort of thing) would be good no matter what.  Some how, they mananged to mess it up. Lunch time wait is always a long time.  The last trip was 51 minutes to get food delivered from ordering.   They are busy because the food choices in the area are very limited."}
{"text":"At time of this review there are only 2 open bars in Gateway/3rd Ward Charlotte (here and Pub at Gateway).  Still not decided on which I prefer.  My apartment is essentially above both but this one is slightly closer so it's gotten the nod so far.   Pros...  1) Half price appetizers 4-7 weekdays.  Though consisting of mostly fried food its at least hand breaded.  2) $3 microbrew mystery beer bottles everyday.   3) Open for brunch on weekends.  Cons.    Cons... 1) Table service can often be slow 2) limited sports packages on TV and standard definition (w/ stretched pictures)  Due to its small size and being located on the edge of uptown makes this place a decent local dive bar. If they could fix the TV situation it would make this a good local sports bar alternative as well."}
{"text":"The food was cold when it came out to us, and it wasn't busy at all. Service was slow and the girl didn't care about the food being cold. Also the manager didn't care either. I would never recommend this place to anyone are go back myself. So somewhere else please you will enjoy yourself alot more."}

{"text":"Walking home from dinner...after a few drinks, but not too many....so why not a few before bed...still is nice to have a bar right across the street where I live.  Now that the weather is nice....you should check it out."}
{"text":"Just polished off a whole thing of crab dip....delish! Atmosphere seems chill. Live music Mondays and Tuesday could stop by more frequently."}
{"text":"There are a few reasons to go to Cedar Street Tavern, none having to do with the place's food options, which maybe isn't a bad thing for a tavern. Perhaps you live in Charlotte's Gateway area; you're pretty limited as far as walking-distance bar/pubs go, so CST makes sense given its location. Maybe you're feeling a little lonely, in which case you can enjoy a moderately-priced cocktail at the always-packed-but-never-crowded singles bar. You like to smoke, you say? The Tavern is your mecca: everyone there is smoking. I think I saw the Hostess smoking a cigarette mid-shift.  The food's fine, but not exactly noteworthy. Decent wings and nachos; mediocre pizzas; passable salads--that sorta thing. Stay away from the entrees--there's just no reason. Again, though, nothing on the menu's gonna have you anxious to return.   But if you're looking for a drink after work, this place is great. Plenty of indoor tables, a happening bar area, and even three or four umbrella-ed outdoor tables. There's also a projection screen TV and more than a few flat-screens if you're looking to snag an out-of-town game.   The staff is friendly, the drinks are cold, the patrons nondescript. You'll never leave raving about the place, but then again, you'll never really leave unhappy, either."}
{"text":"Our friendly neighborhood tavern! We love it...great food, drink specials and the bartenders are always awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for when you just need a drink or a bite to eat and you don't want to get too fancy. It definitely has that neighborhood feel. The bartender is always super friendly. They have a surprisingly large menu. It's bar food so don't expect a whole lot. However, their wings and chicken tenders are very good. They have a pretty good selection of local beers."}
{"text":"It is an average place to go.......nothing sticks out about it. I was here for lunch on Saturday while visiting my sister. It is good we went here vs somewhere uptown as we were getting lunch right when the JWU graduation was finished. With that said, the food is decent. A good variety of sandwiches, burgers, salads and soup. We got fried pickles to start as an app and they were good. The right amount for three out of the four of us to share. I got a turkey club wrap that was filling enough and came with fries that I didn't finish........not because they were bad just no room. The rest of the table got either a salad or sandwich (buffalo chicken seemed to be popular at my table either in salad or sandwich form). Service was ok. Seemed to be a few regulahs there- people who live in the building or the one across the street (like my sis). Prices are aok."}
{"text":"I went with some girlfriends on a Wednesday and it was trivia night. We ordered a few appetizers and drinks. The food took a while to come out but the drink service was excellent. I would go back."}
{"text":"It starts with the staff, Shaun, Jess & Ben do a great job engaging people and keeping the conversation going.  The food is much better than I expected the first time I had eaten there.  I believe I've had just about everything on the menu and all are very good.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the pasta dishes.  Which is odd for me as I've had many bad experiences with bar pasta."}
{"text":"My experience at Cedar Street Tavern wasn't so memorable. I figured I'd give it a shot since I always see people outside hanging out on the high tops, and it looked like a cool place. It is a few blocks down from Tryon, so there is not much else going on around it. We ate inside at the bar and there were only a handful of people there other than us. We wanted to give the wings a shot, but they weren't very good, and the first bite had us wishing we had gone to Alexander Michael's instead. But, we were here and already committed, so we kept on.   The kitchen was sooooo slow! We were waiting for our food for so long that we actually started making up our own lyrics to the songs playing about how long our food was taking to kill time, and that it did. My fiancee ordered a salad and I ordered the three cheese stuffed chicken over fettuccini alfredo, in other words, the heart-attack-on-a-plate, (although not the \"oh my god, this is AMAZING!\" kind.) I could barely make my way through half of it, partly because it was so heavy, but also because the cheese wasn't even fully melted and it was overall not so good.  The one semi-cool part about the place is the way it is set up. They have an eclectic vibe going with bluish black walls painted with stick-figure type people that look like they are dancing, and the stars and shooting stars lit up all over the walls and ceilings brought me right back to the 90's when we all had those glow in the dark ones stuck to our bedroom ceilings. I would recommend trying this place for a drink on the weekends, but I'd eat elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for the food and the friendly staff. The turkey club was very good but the beer was a little disappointing. I tried two different tap beers and both were a little flat and tasted like the lines needed to be cleaned."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch yesterday and ordered the cedar burger with sweet potato fries and it was terrific. A very nice and friendly bartender took our orders as well as a few Samuel Adams taps.   A great place to visit if visiting Johnson and Wales which is right next door and the double tree hotel in which we stayed."}
{"text":"Food was great, got the cedar burger, great taste and great value for the money  Bob Marley is bumping on the radio  Lots of beer on tap   If I was a local, I'd come here often- like most of the crowd"}
{"text":"Cedar Street Tavern is a laid back neighborhood bar with friendly staff and funky decor. It's a great place to watch a game or grab a drink after work, and we find ourselves coming here after Knights or Panthers games, too.  The service is excellent and they've got great drink specials throughout the week--try the $3 mystery beer if you're feeling a little adventurous.  The food is typical bar fare but my fiancé and I are kind of obsessed with their hot wings, specifically with the \"Lip Kisser\" sauce."}
{"text":"This should be a 3 part reveiw. If you are a bar hopping bopper such as myself.... If you've been to Rock Bottom about 6-7yrs ago you would have seen Chris, Mike, Shawn and a few others (one guy working the ktichen)...  well after a few years they moved from there to Cedar Street.  Shawn got a bump to manager/supervisor and it was cool. Take care of your regulars. Roland was the man b4 he set out 2 become the next tiger woods..lmao- he's a good dude Mike did what he does (what ever that may be) even the guy in the kitchen changed jobs to come here.  a few years later.. welp...yelpers...   They have moved to Black Fin (wondering if its some type of Resturant Maffia)   Now on to the subject at hand...... CEDAR STREET TAVER...ohhh how I missed the old days. You know. the old days where i could get a beer and a shot for lets sayyyyyy UNDER 15 BUCKS...smh  Food is pretty good. considering  Drinks are too much, the place isnt' really big and can get crowded. The way its set up with the bar 3 feet from the entrance to appear FULL from the outside.  It probably has a compasity of 90 ppl or so.  The bar is shaped like aaaaaa... like aaa.. Hell, I have no idea. But its wack!!   Maybe 5 seats on one side (1 seat puting you in the way of the kitchen traffic), maybe 5-6 on one side, 2 on one side, and maybe 4-6 on the other side (last seat puting you in the way of other patrons, kitchen etc traffic)  so in counting... thats 4 sides but nooo. not like a square. but like a hell.. I'm still trying to figure out what kinda shape it is."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place!  I've never been disappointed with the food or the service.  Some of my favorite items are - BBQ chicken salad, mushroom turkey burger, fried calamari and their French fries! It's right across the street from my job so lunch is a bit of a crunch but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a seat."}
{"text":"There is no greater joy in city-living than finding a new place and initiating it as a regular spot.  Cedar Street Tavern is truly a hidden gem amongst the sports bars, clubs, snazzy restaurants, and other stereotypical joints you tend to find Uptown...so much so I'm a little nervous to share it with the world.  But I digress...  We've been to Cedar Street several times for a variety of different occasions.  For nights that you just don't feel like cooking, the menu has a huge variety of offerings that can appeal to the health fanatic (grilled salmon) or to satisfy your run-of-the-mill bar food craving (fried things galore).    Oftentimes when restaurants offer a huge selection of menu items, the quality of the food suffers from the quantity.  Shockingly, this was not the case with Cedar Street Tavern's offerings.  From the salads, to the fried pickles, to the aforementioned salmon, and beyond...their food is actually really really good.  (Ahem, and they have a late night menu).   For nights you need a stiff drink...you can also find what you are looking for....    I was pretty impressed with their drink menu.  With a solid (but nothing fancy) selection of wine, local craft beers, and a great variety of spirits, everyone is sure to find something to hydrate their bad selves.  Another pretty outstanding quality was the weekly drink specials, which can be either disappointing or nonexistent in Uptown Charlotte.  The consistency and special choice each night has something that will appeal (again) to everyone and usually features 1 domestic beer, 1 craft beer, a liquor special, or some type of shot.    The prices are pretty decent too; reasonablle with a cost level for college students and bank executives.   Perhaps the one characteristic of Cedar Street Tavern that will continue to set them apart from other local bars and pubs in the area are the people slinging the items mentioned above.    The waitress we've had several times is absolutely delightful and definitely humors me when I ask her recommendations 34,843 times (trust her, she's spot on).  The bartender/bar manager, Shaun, is also extremely friendly and easy to talk on a busy Friday night or slow Sunday afternoon.  He strikes the right balance of enough conversation to make you feel welcome but reserved enough to let you talk amongst yourselves.    Engaging people, impressive food, and a great drink menu.  If you need both a casual and fun spot in Uptown, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Options are limited in this part of town (West Uptown) so like another place around the corner this place is more than adequate in most respects.  Nothing fancy, decent bar food and reasonable prices.  It's usually a friendly, laid back crowd.   I'd give this place a higher rating if only for one thing.  The lead male bartender who is there most nights.  His bartending is fine, and I've talked to him enough to see he's not a bad guy, but his demeanor could definitely use some work in my humble opinion.  Specifically this... In all the times I've been there I don't think I've seen him smile once.  I don't need superficial, \"16 pieces of flair\" type friendliness- in fact I appreciate when customer service people act real rather than fake (it's quite easy to spot)- but my goodness would it kill you to smile once in a while?!?  I mean I'm not a super friendly, chipper person but even I've been known to smile on occasion.  People come to a bar to escape and have fun and when you're getting your drinks from someone who looks like they don't want to be there it does put a damper on things (maybe not to all people but definitely to me). Worth checking out if you're in the area but nothing to go out of your way for unless you want to try to see if you can get Grumpy McGrumperson to smile."}
{"text":"We just moved into an apartment across the street from Cedar Street Tavern and I am so thrilled to have a little pub so close. We have tried all sorts of options on the menu from chicken fingers to the black and blue salad to chicken Alfredo and even the crab dip and nothing has been subpar yet. The restaurant itself has a lot of character and some fun activities on Monday and Wednesday nights. We have been 4 times since we moved in just over a month ago and can't see us slowing down."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 chicken wings & got 5 small wings, no drum sticks just 5 small flats, I said no thanks I don't want them, bartender told me he has to pay for them if I don't want them. I said sorry I'm not paying for that, it's a terrible deal, they don't even look good.  To think that a bartender has to pay for crappy food served from the kitchen is ridiculous! They need to fix your system! I eat here all the time & very unstratified!"}
{"text":"Other reviews seem to be spot on in regards to this place being a hit or miss. That goes for food and service. Been here a couple times thus far. Got great service the first time, but chicken tenders that were as tough as leather. Then on the next visit, good food, but took us 10 minutes to get a bottle of beer. They weren't very busy. Just seemed as if they didn't want to bring the beer over to the table."}
{"text":"Cedar Street Tavern is a great place to go for lunch.  They have their regular menu, but each day they have a 'specials' menu too.  They have some of the BEST sweet potato fries (and yes, I have to say I like them better than the Penguin's sweet potato fries).  However, they serve them with ketchup so you may want to ask them for a side of honey mustard - YUM!!!  I haven't had one thing yet that I didn't like.  I've had a sampling of their salads, burgers, and sandwiches and have never been disappointed.   If you go at lunch, try and go a little earlier because the tavern does fill up quite quickly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  It has such a unique style \"W\" bar and the whole decor is rather unique.  It doesn't hurt that they sport half price appetizers from 4-7pm M-F and $3 drafts.  Jackpot!  We ordered the chicken sandwich (delicious) and the wings.  The wings were \"eh\" but everything else was great.  (there are better wings at Stool Pigeons).  I will definitely be coming back there though.  I want to try the nachos!  Tiffany N. is right.  \"Great place for after work drinks!\"  Enjoy!  PS.  Newcastle on tap.. dank you  -Ian"}
{"text":"Been living down the street for 6 years and never come here. The rib eye sandwich is awesome and so are the wings but for some reason i don't love this place. I forget the guy's name but him and Jen at the bar are the only ones worth anything. Table service usually blows and the bar is supposed to look like a leaf but its a horrible space waster for such a tight location. I'd go here more often if they had anything worth buying that 600 other bars within a 5 minute uber drive could offer."}
{"text":"Terrible and will not be back.  First beer order was skunked. Sent it back. Second try, the keg kicked just as they started to pour. Never mind, I'll just have a bottle...  Did the steak for dinner.  The veggies came out still frozen and the medium rare steak was burnt to a crisp.  Told the waiter... got a \"do you want me to take it back?\"... um, yes please. 20 minutes later, food is still not out.  My co-worker had finished his dinner by then so we asked for the check.  They brought my food with the check and said \"take your time... no hurry\". Seriously?  Glad other people had a better experience but this was not worth the effort of a second chance."}
{"text":"awesome drink specials? half off apps 4-7? sold.  Table service is hit or miss, but I've never been disappointed at the bar. The food specials are usually pretty good and I'm a fan of the barbalo (part bbq, part buffalo) wings. It does win some serious points due to the proximity to home and school, but I've never had an experience to deter me from the place... it is always just good enough or better.   They usually don't have a problem making tv channel adjustments for games (and they have a decent amount of tvs), the staff is for the most part friendly and competent, but I usually look forward to a few drinks and an app here, not a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Fun, eclectic place to stop by for lunch or after work.  You can call ahead & pick-up as well if you've only got time to grab & go.  I'm quite partial to the Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap...except I substitute Ranch for the Honey Mustard ;) & thankfully no one gives me grief.  Also good are the burgers & Salmon Caesar Salad.  This was the first place I tried Sweet Potato Fries and they've spoiled me for anyone else.  Definitely a local joint - lots of BofA associates & Gateway residents."}
{"text":"So being an out of town LA girl last month kinda sucked, especially when it was right around the end of the regular season for the Lakers. I was staying at the Doubletree on Trade Street and called around to a few spots to see if they would show the game. I didn't want to walk uptown because I had just come from there and I was seriously exhausted from all day travel, so I said screw it, and the lady I roomed with and I walked the block and a half up to Cedar Street Tavern. That was the best decision I made ;) Our bartender was freakin awesome (I think her name was Jess, but I can't remember - blame the mix of jetlag and alcohol). She was a total sweetheart that changed the channel on the tvs so that I could watch the Lake show. She made some pretty good drinks, and introduced me to the best thing ever - FIREFLY! Good God, I fell in love that night! She was awesome to explain that you can only get it at ABC stores and that you can't buy alcohol at the market and you cant buy it on Sundays... what the...? where am i?! lol Regardless, the food we had was good (although I seriously can't remember what we ordered) lol... and the drinks were great.. and the service was exceptional! i can't wait to go back again next May!"}
{"text":"Food good, service great, atmosphere with neighborhood feel. Eaten there many many times. Our go to place."}
{"text":"It was a late night for us, we arrived at the tavern shortly after 1 am. The waiter was genuinely happy to see us, and was very helpful. After 1 am they stop serving any food from the regular menu, but have the \"late night\" menu available. That includes your typical bar food: wings, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, chicken tenders, onion rings, calamari, crab dip. We tried the first five. The food was good, but could have been a little warmer.   They have \"mystery beer\" and it was fun, and the beer was good. They also have cheap domestic beer, and different specials through out the week. Unfortunately, I don't live in Charlotte or I would probably become a regular on \"Wednesday-trivia\" and \"Tuesday Open-Mic\".  The area seemed nice, but not a lot a people out and about at that time of the night. It is a great place to have some late night snack and beers. Thanks to our waiter for an outstanding service."}
{"text":"Food was an experience I wish I could forget.  Nothing stood out and I don't see a reason to return. There are many other places in Charlotte that I would rather frequent."}
