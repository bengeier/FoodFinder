{"text":"Sorry to say but disappointed! Staff was happy and enthusiastic however I found it over priced and average. I had the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich and it had 4 thin slices of meat and a little mustered on rye. They garnish the sandwich with 3 larger pickles. That and a large Coffee cost me over $8.00. Ouch I almost spent my whole lunch budget on finger food. If you are looking for the hip hole in the wall caffe to have coffee this is for you. But as a meal option give it a second thought as you have better options down the street."}

{"text":"I was expecting a traditional European cafe with European style sandwiches, espresso and baked goods. Instead I found a small mom and pop shop with a ton of stuff going on behind the counter. I appreciate the humble atmosphere, but it just wasn't what I expected. Most of the menu items could be found at a cafeteria.

I wanted tea, but all they had were generic tea bags. I wasn't feeling any of it so I got a bottle of water and I tried their egg salad sandwich. 

It was a pretty goods egg salad. Another thing I did like about this place is the friendliness and the way they packed my sandwich in a little take away bag just like a mom would do for her school-aged child. They also showcase a local artist on the walls. You can admire her work by sitting in the shop, or you can take her business card if you're interested in purchasing.

Overall, pretty cute, not too shabby. It's a good place to grab an easy coffee and lunch.
