{"text":"It's very delicious! The owner here is extreamly nice, the food is cheap and tasty. I found the taste of my home!"}
{"text":"So far is the most delicious n yummy Malaysian foods we love in this desert area!! The boss from Johor, so consider is local people from Malaysia but ald stay at US for more than 10 years but move to this area only 3 years plus...definitely will visit frequently to test all the foods that I missed!! 1st try love the NasiLemak and Char Keiw Tiao(Fried flat noodle) so much!! Curry rice still got room to improve as I like thick curry rather than watery. Barley drink is awesome!"}
{"text":"A great find for anyone who likes Malaysian food!!! The food is overall very good and fairly authentic to what you get in Malaysia. Went there for the first time with my family last night and thoroughly enjoyed the food, service and warmth of the servers. The servers were very attentive and responsive to our needs and wishes, but not at all intrusive. We will definitely be back soon and recommend o our friends and family."}
{"text":"A tucked-away treasure.  I needed a quick lunch & have sworn off fast food, so I walked into this newly established restaurant. It's kind of hidden behind a Burger King & another restaurant, but what a find. I was greeted immediately by several smiling employees. That's always a good sign. The menu is easy to read & there are vegetarian options. Prices are good.  Food came out fast, & piping hot. Not too spicy with fresh ingredients (a must). I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try a different dish."}
{"text":"First Malaysian restaurant in the East Valley... since Bunga Raya closed down. If you live in AZ, and craving for Malaysian food, your only choice is Neo Malaysian Kitchen in Tucson, or go to LA or Vegas.   Food Ratings: * Char Kuey Teow - definitely one of their better dishes, if memory serves me correctly, theirs is better than Neo Malaysian's. I would rate this a 4 out of 5. * Nasi Lemak - Sambal is delicious, although I wish they could have deep dried anchovies, and replace the fried chicken chop with real Malaysian-style fried chicken leg/thighs. 3.5 out of 5. * Laksa - Laksa is different depending on which part of Malaysia you're from, but their version is decent. It has some spiciness to the broth and comes with good portion of sides. 4 out of 5. * Teh Tarik - Not sweet enough, back home Teh Tarik is super sweet, but I guess it's healthier with less sugar. 3.5 out of 5. * Milo Peng - You can order this although it's not on the menu, but I am a pro in making this myself, so I like mine better :) 3 out of 5.  We also wanted to order Hainan Chicken but they were out of it. So I guess we will be back again to try that. The other problem is, the menu items are mostly street food style dishes, I wish they could have something like Sambal Shrimp, Rendang Beef, Satay, Vegetable (since no kangkung) Belacan, etc.  I hope this restaurant can survive for the long haul, the problem with Malaysian restaurants in AZ is not enough Malaysian population to sustain them (see Bunga Raya). The food has to be appealing to the general population too, which is not used to this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Tempe. My girlfriend and I came here last week and were impressed. Authentic and delicious Malaysian food at a unbeatable price. We ordered appetizers, 2 entrees, and drinks. The bill was still under $20."}
{"text":"Just discovered this 'cafe' and were pleasantly surprised. Malaysian hospitality and great home-style cooking. We took 3 different dishes with our party and will certainly come back to check other dishes. All portions were filling at a price of 7 dollar each. The ambiance is simple and could have been just transposed from Malaysia. The menu is limited, but every item is worth a try and -in our experience- clearly authentic. Service is perfect and extremely friendly. Highly recommendable!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch - great food.  They were featured in this month's Phoenix Magazine so we went.  The owner had no idea that the restaurant was featured - we sent them the article once we got home!  Great people, awesome food - will go back."}
{"text":"Fairly priced home made tasting Malaysian food. A few stand outs are the Sambal Fried Rice, char kway teow and the noodle with seafood and chicken egg gravy (n9). The nasi lemak and fried chicken wings are decent too. Looking forward to a more expanded menu. Oh and the barley drink is refreshing with the perfect amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews. But today was very curious. When we came in on a Saturday afternoon there was no place to sit. Not because the place was packed, but half of the tables were full of dirty dishes stacked from previous customers. We had to push away these dirty plates to make room so we can sit. I have never been to a restaurant when that happened.  The floor was equally dirty with food droppings.... What a mess.  I ordered a chicken curry dish. I wish the curry temperature was hotter. The chicken pieces were tough. The taste of the curry soup is good. I wish the chicken were more tender.   We also ordered chicken wings appetizer. But those did not come until we finished eating after we reminded them a couple of times. The chicken wings were fried ok, but taste ...just so so."}
{"text":"The nasi lemak is very good and so are the laksa and mee siam. I've tried the shrimp fried rice once; not a fan.The chicken curry is also not my style; not enough chicken, sauce too watery, and the potato was hard. Haven't tried the rest yet but I think I am sticking to nasi lemak for now. Yes, I am gonna keep going there until they tell me not to."}
{"text":"Food slowly improving since initially opening up and more dishes introduced, the mee siam is decent, worth coming back for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I rarely find a place that can make food spicy enough for me, and this place does it for me! The food is great and the staff is really friendly and funny. My roommate is a little shy of foreign foods, but we found something for him to enjoy while I got to indulge in some more exotic items. I definately need to go back and try more items on the menu, as they all looked appealing to me.  Will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"My second visit here and the same lady remembered my face when she greeted me. The smell of fresh rice and noodles entice your senses before you even have a chance to look at the menu or gaze at the digital menu Displayed on flat screens. The Bandung drink is absolutely delicious and refreshingly different than typical boba tea, with a rosy aftertaste that makes you want to savor the flavor longer. The decor is simple with Visit Malaysia posters that offer a future vacation idea to those that fall in love with the cuisine first... The LCD screen in the dining room features beautifully prepared dishes, as well as facts about the Malaysian culture and cuisine. I love that idea because it makes a customer more interested in the cuisine and allows for better cultural exchange to occur indirectly. This restaurant is a refreshing addition to the Tempe/Phoenix food arena."}
{"text":"Met some friends here who are visiting the valley for the long weekend. This is the first time for me to try Malaysian food. I was very happy with the food I order (Seafood over Rice). It was good. I believe this is family-owned. Everyone was so accommodating, friendly and nice. I would highly recommend this place to my friends and will definitely come back since it is so near my work."}
{"text":"I'm a Chinese and I would like to say that this place has very good Asian foods and drinks!  And the price is also very good! Really love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm always looking for new and interesting/yummy food. They have a TV inside that explains what Malaysian food is so if you are a first timer, watch. I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The saus for the roti was extremely watery. The laksa supposed to be with chicken and tofu. There was no chicken, but some fake fishballs, and one piece of tofu. This soup was also extremely watery. The only good think was their water melon with ice drink. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"I love Malaysian food so I was excited to find this place was close to an area I needed to be in.  The service was exemplary, they really took time to explain things in the menu and how they are prepared.  We tried the fried rice and a noodle dish both of which were generously portioned and had the ice kacang for dessert which was a real treat and truly a different and authentic Malaysian offering. The atmosphere was relaxed and a great place for an inexpensive yet exotic meal.  Also very clean. Another place I will be looking forward to going back to."}
{"text":"Great hang out place if u miss Asian food. The staff are amazing. They are friendly and efficient. Even have chilli padi. We ordered prata, hor fun and nasi lemak. The prata is a little small and curry diluted and cold. The horfun is yummy. Nasi lemak is amazing. Chicken is juicy and crispy! Rice have the aroma of coconut milk and is nicely done as it's not broken. The sambal chilli is . Highly recommended place. Will be back again.."}
{"text":"BP street cafe is hands down on of my favorites in Tempe.  Their portions are HUGE and cheap! Some other reviewer said this place is over price?!? I shared an entree , a drink, and an appetizer with someone else , and the total came out to be 11 bucks!   I'd recommend the laksa and the Malaysian fried noodles for entree."}
{"text":"Very good , healthy , fresh food, like home cooked. Family owned restaurant , grandma is the chef!  Loved the roti canai!"}
{"text":"The only Malaysian place in town (or at least the only one I know of) so I have nothing to baseline it with. I've always only ordered food from BP through Postmates before and I've never been disappointed. The food servings were quite generous. My favorite take out has been the combination fried rice, packed with flavor . The roti canai was barely enough for one person however, so if you're planning to share with others, order more.   This week, for a change, my friend and I decided to eat in house. I ordered the ginger chicken rice and he ordered the basil chicken from the lunch menu.  Ginger chicken rice - came with boiled egg on the side which was delicious. The chicken was definitely heavy with ginger flavor but not overwhelming. It paired really well with the white rice with dark sauce. 3.5/5 Basil chicken - came with side salad, fried rice, wonton chips, and a vegetable spring roll. The chicken was tender and absolutely yummy! The curry that it was in was amazing. 4.5/5   Serving sizes in store were okay, neither of us were filled after our meals. Service was really fast, except that we did not know we had to get up and pay at the counter so we sat there for a while waiting for the check. Silly us!"}
{"text":"Living in the Phoenix area you get tired of the same ol' pizza, sandwiches, and chinese/vietnamese/thai food that you can get on just about every corner gets extremely tiring.  Finding something a little different has been a Godsend.    I've never had Malaysian cooking before but I've seen pictures and it always looked so good. And guess what!  It IS so good!  I've tried two dishes from delivery and both have been amazing.    First thing I had was Nasi Lemak.  I LOVE having different flavors and everything was delicious.  The sambal was one of the best things I've ever eaten!  I did try the momo chaha and sadly, I just wasn't ready for yams in a sweetened milk.  It wasn't bad, but my tastebuds have some evolving to do before I try it again.  Second time I ordered mee siam.  It was amazing!  And don't forget the bandung drink.  It's a little different but you can't miss out on it.  My friends in Singapore have told me how good it was and they are not lying!    I can't wait for my next meal at BP Street :D"}
{"text":"The first couple of our visits the first were okay. One day, I decided to order the chicken in stir fried in ginger and brown sauce. It took a while for the order to come out. The chicken was bland and not well marinated. A LOT OF RICE, but only 7 thinly sliced pieces of chicken and it cost almost $8. It is a riff-off. Other dishes are okay, but their portion is small and not much protein. So be prepared to either order more food or go hungry."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try something new/different and Bp Street Cafe has been in my Yelp bookmarks for a while so we figured this was the perfect chance! I've never had Malaysian food, so I of course have nothing to compare this experience to, however, we were fairly pleased with our meals.  I ordered the Ginger Chicken and my date got the Char Kway Teow.  After only a couple of bites of the Ginger Chicken I was a bit disappointed but my date offered to trade his meal with mine! I'm not sure what it was about the Ginger Chicken that I didn't like however my date really liked it. The only qualm was that the egg was really overcooked and had a grey ring around the yolk. Based on the photos that I've seen on Yelp, they have always made their eggs this way.   The Char Kway Teow was a noodle dish. We ordered it at medium spice which was not too spicy but it definitely had a kick to it. The noodles were really soft and tasty, but the only thing was that the dish was really dry; I wish it came in some sort of sauce.  My date had been here before and had thought it was just okay. I would have to agree with his assessment; it was nice to try something new, however, I'm not sure when we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Malaysian restaurant in Arizona. Very reasonable prices as well which is one of the main plus point."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my girlfriend and it was absolutely great. It's really unique food that has made me a regular customer. The staff is warm and friendly and the quality of the food is simply excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious Malaysian food. Authentic flavors and recipes. Very friendly family run restaurant. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"BP Street Cafe is a dependable establishment for a night when you're just far too lazy to cook for yourself and want something carby and delicious. Case in point, my sister, roommate and I found ourselves starving after a night of rock climbing (whaddup Focus Climbing Center) and in need of tasty grub. Enter, BP. Tucked away in a kind of bare plaza, it's a tad bit hard to see from the street, but don't worry folks, we made it. Very excited about the first time having Malaysian food in the valley, as we grew up in the Bay Area where tons of different types of food are available. We were pretty tired and super chalky, so we elected to take it to go. At around 8pm on a Tuesday, our to-go order took about 15 minutes. Not bad at all.   First up, the Bandung Drink. My default drink with Malaysian/any southeast Asian food is usually Thai tea, because there's just nothing that cuts the spicyfire in my mouth quite like it does. But I decided to branch out this time. I wouldn't say that I regret my decision, but I will say that I would definitely have been happier with Thai iced tea. Please keep in mind that Thai tea and I have a love affair for the ages. The Bandung drink was good, a hint floraly and a hint coconut milk-y, with some red bean friends hanging out at the bottom. Mostly, I was sold on the color of it, because I'm a child. It was a perfectly fine drink, but I likely won't be ordering it again.   Roti Canai is one of my favorite Malaysian dishes, because bread is one of my favorite things in this world, in all forms. At $2.50 a pop, the roti canai is a steal here. Just keep in mind that it's a lil guy, definitely meant as a precursor to your full meal. The roti was excellent, crispy and flaky, yet the middle layers were just dense enough to give it the structural integrity it needs. The curry dipping sauce came with one piece of potato and one piece of chicken, and was extremely tasty but also extremely spicy. There was no spiciness ranking system on this sauce when we ordered.   For the main course, I chose Char Kway Teow, my favorite Malaysian noodle dish. Holybingobango. I didn't know that such quality Malaysian food existed in Tempe, Arizona. The CKT was so flavorful, the noodles pairing so nicely with the shrimp and the bits of fried egg existing as extra flavor pockets. They didn't skimp on the shrimp either! My one mistake, was ordering it with medium heat. I thought I could handle it, but I was super wrong. I'd say their medium is probably closer to a hot. It tasted amazing, I just had to supplement each bite of noodles with a huge sip of Bandung, and then approximately a liter of water after that ran out. The portion sizes are pretty dang hefty, too, especially considering the price point. I had plenty left over to bring to work for lunch the next day, shoving noodles into my face as I went through spice sweats with tears in my eyes. Totally worth it.   All in all, a solid experience. I know it's not fair to compare them to Malaysian food I've had in the bay, but it's hard when that's what you're accustomed to. They definitely exceeded my expectations of what I'd find out here, though. As BP is real close to my house, I definitely foresee trying a lot of the menu in my future. And luckily they're on postmates, so I won't ever even have to leave my home--a hungry, lazy person's dream."}
{"text":"I have to give it a 4 star partly because they're one of the only Malaysian restaurants around here that do it right. Side note: BP is a city in Malaysia where I'm from, so I'm may be a little bias. However, I can verify that there are many iconic Malaysian dishes on the menu that are must trys.   First off, we went as a huge group and they were able to accommodate all of us with great service. The drink menu offers a lot of authentic non-alcoholic drinks, such as the tea tarik (Indian tea) and milo. You can get it over iced or warm. I prefer warm because it's more flavorful and I don't sip it all within 5seconds. We ordered a round of roti canai, which is essentially nan bread + curry. The curry was very flavorful! I had the Char Kway Teow, a dry noodle based entree. The noodles are soft and pan fried. You can specify the level of spicy when ordering. Overall, I think it's worth a try if you haven't had Malaysian Cuisine and willing to experiment with food a little. I will definitely be back to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"We had the laksa (SO good!), Mee Siam (good), and honey chicken (not bad but not something I'd order again).  My pick-up order was ready on time and the staff was courteous. I didn't get much of a look around due to my accompanying hyper toddler but the place looked very spacious and much more modern than I had expected. Great place!"}
{"text":"the environment is very peace, the waitresses are nice and food is delicious, especially the momochacha, haha"}
{"text":"Good but mixed. We had the ginger chicken and the firecracker chicken. Firecracker was deliciously spicy and had a lot of flavor but the ginger chicken needed more...  more ginger and more flavor. The barley tea was tasty. Never had that before."}
{"text":"I'm not Malaysian or an expert at this food and this is the first time I been to this restaurant.  As soon as I walked in the door a small Asian girl with the biggest smile on her face greeted me at the door.  -- \"Thats pretty dope\" I thought to my self.  The food wasn't bad either, it was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"We ordered the roti canai, pork chop rice and Laksa. First of all we didn't know what the price is going to be since there is no price on the menu but we came for the good food based on reviews so we didn't really care. We got our roti in the size smaller than my hand but there was no dipping sauce at all; the vegetable in pork chop rice is over-sweeten pickled cabbage with one thin slice of pickled carrot(not fresh) that you could finished in two bites, the pork chop tasted old and flavorless, and again no dipping sauce (not at all like the picture showed here on the web site). I found one string of bean sprout and two little pieces of fried tofu in my Laksa. The curry broth tasted watered-down. The whole time, our server/hostess's little toddler was running in the restaurant and he threw up on the floor in the middle of our dinner. When we checked out, we found our meal was $30 and we didn't even order any drinks. Also they do not give out paper receipts. I am Asian and this is really an insult to Asian foods. Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"It's been a while since there's been a Malaysian resto in the Phoenix area, the last time there was one was back in the early 2000s. Anywho, for me a Malaysian resto must have a good roti canai, and a delicious Laksa, and BP Street Cafe passes both taste tests! The roti canai is a single serving for one, so, if you have a group you'll have to order a couple, has some spice to it, it's delicious, and the roti isn't flaky and has good consistency. As for the Laksa, it's Johor Laksa and not the Sarawak Laksa I am accustomed to, overall it's spicy, the coconut broth has a good taste to it, and they give plenty of noodle.   I'm looking forward to going back, and trying their Mee Siam, the Nasi Lemak, and their fried chicken. I wish they had Ais Kachang since the weather is getting warmer, and it would be a cool treat to have but I'll try their Momo Chacha in lieu of because it sounds refreshing. Another wish is if they had KangKung Belacan although I think that might be not be as readily available in the Asian grocery stores here.   Anyways I wish BP the best of luck, they make good eats and I'm looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"After perusing the menu online, I decided to try their nasi lemak as my entree and pair it with bandung drink. The coconut rice had a good consistency but seemed to me to lack enough coconut to give it a distinct flavor. The fried chicken filet was cooked just right - the coating was crispy and the chicken was moist and tender; it was on the bland side, though, so I remedied that by asking for additional sambal (aromatic chili sauce), and they serve a really good sambal here. The bandung drink was refreshing, though it took me a few sips to get over the novelty of this milk-based drink. Traditionally bandung is flavored with rose syrup, and I did notice a somewhat floral fragrance although it did not strike me as that of roses. Service is friendly, location is convenient, and parking is no problem. It's worth a repeat visit; I'd like to try other, hopefully more flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"Despite being the only Malaysian restaurant I could find in the Phoenix area this was a very pleasant surprise! The owner was extremely friendly and gave me some recommendations on some dishes for my future visits. It's nice to see a Malaysian restaurant in Tempe that serves up great authentic food and I hope their business does well. Their food comes out fast as well and prices are very reasonable for what you get. I had the Char Kway Teow which was absolutely delicious and the pineapple juice was very good as well, although it was a bit too sweet for my liking.  I would like to try one of their rice dishes next time and will most definitely stop by here again soon."}
{"text":"It's a family restaurant. Great food - Check. Great Customer Service - Check. $ Not too expensive. No dish over $8 check. It's what u will find in other countries as family restaurant. Must visit place if u like not expansive great food place."}
{"text":"The food tasted very authentic and everyone in our party of 6 left extremely satisfied. Specifically, the sambal fried rice was delicious. The server, a young man by the name of Geoffrey Wong, was attentive and polite. I would recommend for any nearby ASU students or anybody in the general area. Also the food was relatively cheap!"}
{"text":"We were really hoping this would be our new place for Malay/Indo inspired food. The place has no ambience, is a mess up front, and the food lacks little to be desired.  Our roti canai appetizer was so tiny and not enough to even share amongst 4 people. It was not served with curry as stated in the menu, it was served with salty, watered-down laksa. So disappointed!  The hainan chicken rice was disappointing too. It was not the tender, super soft chicken which is what chicken rice is all about. The chicken was tasteless and had a boiled texture instead. Accompanying the dish was a sweet flavored soup that didn't go well with the chicken nor the rice. On top of that, the soup was served cold.   Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"One of the worst Malaysian restaurants I have ever been to. The Roti Canai gravy was too diluted. The Chicken wings were bland and oily. The entree Mamuk Mee Goreng came without salt and was so smelly and on my complaint they hesitantly modified it and brought it back. It still smelled so bad and I just left that shitty food on the table and paid at the counter and left. Poor service.  Worst restaurant experience !"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to come in and sit down for a meal here and try a new dish! It was super easy to find and parking is simple. While I was there it was pretty packed for lunch but the staff was friendly and service was fast still. This time we started with the bean curd since I loved it so much last time and roti canai which was so good but when we finished it we were sad we devoured it so quickly. That curry dipping sauce was amazing and the pancake was the perfect vessel for the sauce. I stuck with what I loved yet again with my meal and got the Hainan chicken and my date got the Laksa. This quickly changed though when she decided she loved my dish more than hers but I wasn't even mad to trade because the Laksa was perfect for the slightly chilly day. The thing that caught me off guard is that the place is pretty cheap since I've always ordered delivery before that kind of skews the pricing for me. Definitely one of the places I would recommend to go for Asian food."}
{"text":"The only Malaysian restaurant here in the valley & it's so good & cheap! Definitely will come again soon!"}
{"text":"Decent food, I particularly liked the roti canai. The chicken curry was tasty and arrived piping hot. The potatoes and chicken were cooked to perfection. My only criticism is that while the chicken curry was nice I would have liked it to be spicier and I think it needed a tiny bit of sugar to balance out the flavor. I wasn't a fan of the rendang as I found it to be far too sweet, to the point that I could taste nothing else. Having eaten authentic rendang before, this was just not up to the mark."}
{"text":"We had the nasi lemak and the hainan style chicken with rice. I think this is the only Malaysian restaurant in Arizona, so that makes it pretty unique. The nasi lemak' rice wasn't too flavorful, I think it needed more coconut boost. My boyfriend was in Malaysia for a bit and said the food was not too bad, but I think it can use some work. The hainan style chicken wasn't how we were used to, especially eating Malaysian in California too. I think the chicken in both dishes was a bit bland as well, regardless of the sauce. We also tried to order their tarik tea but they accidentally gave us Thai tea instead so I can't say how their tea is. It's a cute family owned business, I wouldn't go out of my way to have some again but if I'm in the area, I might pop in and give it a go again."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Malaysia!  The char kway teow is very good, and the laksa, roti canai, and ice kacang are good too."}
{"text":"Used Ubereats. Took over 2 hours to get the food. Still considering whether to eat cold food with (accumulated) waters all over it or not."}
{"text":"Bp Street Cafe might be the only restaurant in the metro Phoenix Area that serves up Malaysian Food.   So that means that they are the BEST Malaysian Restaurant around and are worthy of a try for Malaysian Food.   We started with the Al Roti Canal that is described as an Indian Style Pancake with spicy curry sauce. I thought it was somewhat like greasy chewy puff pastry. I did enjoy the taste of the coconut curry sauce that came with it but the sauce had a dry piece of chicken breast in it and a very soft piece of potato.  For my meal I had the National Dish of Malaysia the Ri Nasi Lemak. It was a pile of rice with fried chicken, hard boiled egg, cucumbers, and spicy chili anchovy sauce. The chicken was tasty and seemed infused with mild flavors. The \"Papa Sauce\" (spicy chili anchovy sort of like ketchup) made the chicken more tasty and helped to bring out more flavors in the chicken. I thought the eggs were overcooked and a little chalky. The rice didn't seem to match the description on the menu I had so I'm not certain if I got the correct rice. The rice was described as coconut flavored with cloves and yellow onion. My rice had a nice almost creamy texture but it seemed to lack cloves and onion.  My husband had the Char Kwy Teow. It was a Malaysian stir fried flat noodle dish with shrimp and egg. He asked for it spicy and it was FIERY HOT! It sort of reminded me of Chinese Fried Rice with that soy sauce kind of taste.  This is a family owned restaurant with different generations of family working there. They try to educate you on Malaysian Food showing videos about the food. The owners are very friendly and offer to answer any questions you have about the food.  The interior of the restaurant is nice and modern and I noticed a few outside tables for dining.  Remember this is the only Malaysian Restaurant around so it's the best Malaysian Restaurant  in town!"}
{"text":"I order an item to go, that was stated it had squid. There was no squid and only 4 shrimp. Very disappointing experience.  Seems like you have to eat there or else they will give you trash for take out."}
{"text":"I am originally Malaysian and I was surprised to find a Malaysian restaurant in  Phoenix. I came on a weekday for lunch.  The service was prompt.  Was seated immediately and my order was taken promptly.  I ordered a char Kuey teow spicy.  The good came out in 10 minutes.  It looked and smelt just like Malaysia.   The taste was very authentic except for a lack of salt.  Definitely satisfied I don't want to give it give stars just yet as I want to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Bp Street is like a heaven-sent on Mondays because that's the only day of the week when they serve bak kut teh. The meat just falls off the bone and the soup is herbally which invigorates the senses and gets you excited to resume work. To get you through the week, Bp serves these special chicken wings smothered with some magic sauce on Wednesdays. A great pick-me-up that motivates you to work harder so you can make more money to order more of those chicken wings. In the regular menu, I highly recommend their pork chop rice, nasi lemak (get it with chicken thigh, heed my words), sambal fried rice, char kway teow (best fried noodles you will ever taste), and whatever the tiny lady owner suggests. Will be dropping by like everyday now."}
{"text":"It's so good! It's amazing. I want to order more things, because every dish was amazing. We started with roti amd dipping sauce, very tasty. We had N7 noodles, and wow! I am considering ordering more to take home.  We also had N1 with rice noodles, and that is now on my comfort food list. I liked it better than my thai favorite tom ka gai. We also ordered R1, and it was delicious yet fairly simple. The sauce for it was good and we got it medium hot.  We ordered the tea, which was leas sweet than thai tea and I liked it a lot. We also tried the pinkish drink with red beans which was good but very sweet. I love this place and plan to come back. I am also putting it in my phone so I can call for take out with ease. So good!"}
{"text":"Great place and a great introduction to Malaysian food.  We tried the roti, which was perfectly cooked served with a spicy curry sauce - Wow!  The tea tarik also a must try!  Our entrees included the Kway Teow Mee which was a mix of rice and egg noodles with shrimp, ordered spicy and did not disappoint.  The non-spicy dish we tried was the honey curry chicken, which was also delicious.  Wifi was available which allowed us to watch our favorite game in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with a bunch of lovely ladies. Seated quickly, the waitress/waiter explained well on what's on the menu for those who's not familiar with Malaysian cuisine. We ordered roti canai (Indian style pancake served with spicy curry chicken and potato dipping sauce), nasi lemak (Coconut flavored rice with cloves & yellow onion served with chili anchovies, fried chicken, cucumber and hard boil egg), laksa (rice noodle served a spicy lemon grass, coconut curry broth with chicken breast, fried tofu, and bean sprouts), Mamak mee goreng (Malaysian stir fried egg noodle  with shrimp, chive and sambal), and assorted veggies over rice. The food was good and tasty except for assorted veggies over rice that was bland. The Mamak mee goreng really reminded me of Indonesian mie dokdok (very similar taste). The laksa was very flavorful and satisfying curry broth. The rice of nasi lemak was okay, sort of weak coconut milk flavor and no lemongrass note. The service was okay, our food came out one by one, which was an inconvenience. Nevertheless, I will be back to try something else and maybe some desserts."}
{"text":"Checked this place out base on a friend's recommendation.  Big parking lot outside.  Environment:  Nice and clean environment on the inside. Wasn't too busy when I went. I was essentially the only one.  Fast service.   Food: I ordered the Hainanese chicken.  Chicken was juicy and fresh. It came with side of hot sauce and minced garlic/salt sauce. There was a side of some cucumbers and sour veggies (the good kind). And a lot of rice. The rice was also cooked differently, with I believe like chicken broth. Not your typical steam rice. There was flavor in the rice.  You also get a side of chicken soup.  Downside - not enough chicken when compared to the rice portion size.   Price - around $8 for this plate   Went with a big group and service was just as fast.   Would recommend trying this place for Hainanese chicken, but you've been warned that there's not enough of chicken.   Would have to try the other dishes when I come back."}
{"text":"Authentic Malaysian food and very unique to the Tempe area. I came here to have a dinner with my girlfriend-- I ordered sirap bandung and laksa, she ordered chicken chop noodle soup and Thai tea. Both drinks were sweet and tasty as you might expect, but the real star was of course the soup. The laksa was rich and flavorful with a fair amount of spice (perhaps worth asking if it can be made spicier in the future), but perfect for a rainy/sick day. Served with generous portions of fried tofu, shrimp, fish cake, and chicken! The chicken chop noodle soup had plenty of greens and onion with deep and savory broth, with a fried chicken cutlet served on the side.  You can really tell this place is a family restaurant not just from the bold flavors of the food, but the staff and promotional videos playing on the walls. Our servers and waiters were polite and considerate, even telling us about some off-menu items we should keep an eye out for in the future.  All in all I'm glad I finally made a visit to this place and hope I remember to keep coming back! I would recommend this to anybody, especially if you want to expand your palate."}
{"text":"Where should I start? As a Malaysian, this place serves nothing but authentic Malaysian food. To all the fellow Malaysians, this is the closest place you can get sambal. My personal favorite here is the Sambal Fried Rice + Iced Barley Drink but hey, don't stop there. I've been to Penang Restaurant around the Bay Area and I would say the Char Kuey Teow here is better than those anyday (and this is coming from a Penangite). If you would,  I would also like to recommend the Nasi Lemak and the Hainan Chicken Rice.   PS: For Northern West Malaysian, do note that the names may vary as the owner is a Johorian so it follows the Mid-Southern way. (eg. Laksa is not Asam Laksa but Curry Mee)"}
{"text":"Having so many foodie yelp friends means lots of bookmarks. I have so many restaurants bookmarked, it will take years to visit all of them. Since my list gets bigger as I read more reviews, I thought I would start working on it and this place was it today.  I only spent one week in Malaysia when one of my work trips took me there not too long ago. I fell in love with their food, in fact I ate nasi lemak everyday for breakfast while there. When I saw pictures posted here, it wasn't nasi lemak I ate every morning for a week, no banana leaves, no little dried fish??? So I decided to try hainan chicken rice, my comfort food that I must try at every visit to Singapore.  Rice had nice flavor and chicken was steamed perfectly and juicy. Mildly hot sauce had just right amount of spiciness to it, perfectly complemented chicken and rice. Dish came with a soup, ginger in the soup soothed my sore throat and nicely settled my stomach.    I also tried mee siam. Noodle had nice flavor from shrimp, I added just a bit of another kind of hot sauce, mmmm, very good. This dish was served with deep fried chicken. Oh chicken was cooked so well, although I had two chicken dishes but these two chicken tasted differently, I felt like I was eating two types of meat.   My friend was well prepared by reading Yelp reviews prior to her visit and ordered sweet barely drink. She said it's a must try. I had hot tea tarik. I was under the weather but this hot tea really soothed my throat.   For desert, I tried momo chacha. I like both taro and yam, it was a perfect desert for me. Not too sweet, cool coconut broth helped me cool down. Considering the price, portion was very generous, I couldn't finish all.  Each main dish is about $7-8, nicely priced home made Malaysian food. (Perhaps southeast Asian food?). It takes almost 3 days to fly to Malaysia from Phoenix. If I leave here on Monday, I arrive there on Wednesday morning due to time difference after 4 airplane rides. Now I know of this place thanks to my trusty yelpers, I get to enjoy some of my comfort food with just a short drive."}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed Nasi Lemak connoisseur and OMG that is all I eat at this place!! To say that I love their sambal is an understatement. I am from Malaysia so yes I know what I'm talking about. I really should try the other dishes on the menu but I can't stop ordering nasi lemak. The 5 star is solely for the nasi lemak as I've not gone beyond ordering that."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. My wife has shrimp food allergy and they were able to accommodate and modify some of they poplar dishes and it still tasted great. Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Tried the laksa today. Excellent. Also the teh Tarik. Excellent too. Price wise, very reasonable. I'll be back many more times to get a taste of home. Spoke with the owner(s) very open to adding to the menu, very pleasant folks. Highly recommend, if you are craving Malaysian food, go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time- walked in and was instantly greeted. Server offered up suggestions and gave descriptions for the beverages. I got the Tea Tarik and my friend got the pineapple water. Tea Tarik was a nice milky tea without the sweetness. The pineapple water was sweet and very refreshing. Upon ordering the server offered up some suggestions for the Nasi Lemak to switch out the fried chicken for the honey chicken. Great dishes and will be coming back to especially try their other unique drinks."}
{"text":"When my two favorite types of foods (Thai and Vietnamese) mix together and have a baby, bam! Malaysian food! Think I'll be trading Thai tea for Tea Tarik!!"}
{"text":"For January's International Supper Club UYE we picked BP Street Café and I for one was pretty excited to try them out! I've never had Malaysian cuisine so I was curious about it.   After checking out the menu I went with Laksa, it's more of a soup, its noodles severed in a spicy lemon grass, coconut curry broth with chicken and bean sprouts, it does also come severed with seafood and fried tofu, but I asked for it to be just chicken.  For the noodles I went with the rice noddle.   Laksa is very soupy, and to me it was not that spicy nor did it have a lot of flavor, but it was filling. We also asked for some hot chili paste and that helped a bit, when I go back I will try something else.  Service was great and friendly, and I do want to go back to try out some more of menu, looking at the other dishes that were ordered that night, Im sure I will find something to rave about!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly.  The place is new and clean.  The chairs are a little uncomfortable, but I don't mind for food.  I have eaten standing on the streets in Hong Kong, Mexico, Jamaica, and NYC for great food.  We came here on a Saturday night after a game, the place was 1/3 full.  I got to try these items:  1.  Roti Cani - Indian pancake served with a side of curry dipping sauce.  It is a light crispy bread, pretty good but the curry dipping sauce was spicy (ok for me). 2.  Chicken Wings - 4 pcs fried crispy with Malaysian spices.  Best tasting item from all the items I tried that night, crispy, juice, and well seasoned.   3.  BP Wrapped Chicken - Seasoned chicken wrapped in foil and deep fried.  It was flavorful but just OK. 4.  Thai Ice Tea - It was perfectly sweetened. 5.  Pork Chop Noodle Soup - Noodle soup served with seasoned fried pork chop on the side.  The pork chops were on the salty side and too dry.  And the noodle soup was completed bland.  You have to add a bit of the pork chop with every spoonful of noodle and soup to get some flavor.    The kitchen made a mistake with my friend's order.  They brought her the Kway Teow Mee (comb of flat rice noodle and egg noodle) instead of the Mamak Mee Goreng (egg noodles) away to ask if she wanted to take it.  She said no, then all our of order came out and she was waiting for a good 10 mins before her correct order came out."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but I love their pulled tea the most. I'd go there just for the tea. Atmosphere is nice as well. People are friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to hit up one of the only Malaysian restaurants to have FINALLY graced the area. We were super excited and order the following: Roti Canai, Chow Kway Teow, and the Tea Tarik.  The Chow Kway Teow was delicious and had a good amount of wok hay or \"Breath of the Wok.\" The flat noodles were very short in length probably due to the fact that they hand pull apart the noodles.  The Roti Canai was cooked really well however the curry sauce was a bit watered down, but the flavor was there. The Roti was cooked well but the piece was pretty small.  Lastly, the Tea Tarik was pretty good and but had a bit of a bitter aftertaste most likely due to being steeped for too long.  Customer service was really good and our waitress was very helpful.  Overall, BP Street Cafe is very authentic, but a bit pricey for the amount of food portions you get which kept them from getting the last star."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars for overall friendliness and cuisine choice.   The service here is nice and the staff was friendly in explaining the various cuisine choices. We ordered a tea tarik and iced thai coffee which was unique and refreshing. For our dishes we ordered sambal rice, which is basically fried rice with hot sauce, and firecracker chicken which is a saucy spicy chicken that comes with rice. The flavors were interesting but ultimately the dishes did not wow the tastebuds. We might go back and try some other dishes.   One of the downsides of not being used to these ingredients is the firecracker chicken  caused bathroom discomfort for a day and a half."}
{"text":"We have craved for Malaysian food for a some time (I am from Malaysia). Thank you BP, for allowing us to have food from home again. Our first visit, we had char kway teow and wan tan hor. We loved both!  Will visit again when they re-open in August 2017. Maybe then nasi lemak and mi Siam? Slurps!!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to say YES to everything on the menu!  BIG Malaysian Thank you for bringing me back to my favorite childhood meals. terima kasih!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this Malaysian restaurant and was happy to finally visit. The interior was clean, spacious, and fitting for groups of all sizes. It included an open kitchen upon entering, followed by a score of tables and booths neatly organized along the walls and large windows. Business has been slow this summer, but hopefully things will pick up quickly once the school year starts.    The dishes I enjoyed so far are the Roti Canal ($2.50), a flaky pancake that came with a good chew served with a spicy chicken and potato curry. The pancake arrived on the greasy side, but it carried a nice flavor that further extended when dipped in the hearty spicy curry. I would absolutely love this dish if they could eliminate the excess grease, and serve the curry at a higher temperature.   I also recommend the Laksa ($7.50) that came with a huge bowl of egg and rice noodles, lemongrass and curry broth, and topped with chicken, fried tofu, hard boiled egg, bean sprouts, fish balls, and shrimps. The broth was deliciously spicy with a pointed lemongrass flavor and complicated by the flavors of spicy curry and coconut milk. The quality of the noodles was decent, a bit overcooked, and the toppings interacted well with the broth to further enrich the flavors. It was a winner.  The Hainan Chicken Rice ($7) was served with a thigh and leg chopped into four pieces and served with a chicken-flavored steamed rice, soup, pickled veggies, and cucumber. The chicken was tender and flavorful, but not the best I have tasted. The rice was nicely seasoned and equally addictive were the picked veggies. Unfortunately, the soup was bland and didn't add or complement the range of flavors.  I was disappointed with the Mee Siam ($7), served with a mix of flat and egg noodles stir-fried with dried curry, tofu, egg, bean sprouts, and shrimps. The noodle quality was deplorable. Even though there was a depth of flavor in the stir-fry, but the toppings were skimpy and not made with care.   I was also intrigued by the Nasi Lemak ($7) that was put together with fried chicken, coconut rice, chili anchovies, cucumber, hard boiled egg, and peanuts. The fried chicken was too bland without seasoning, and the overall flavor was dependent upon the coconut rice, peanuts, and anchovies. Not good.  Overall, the results were mixed, but there were still enough there for me to want to return. Service was friendly, personable, and responsive to add to their excellent portions and prices. I would be interested in returning to try their pork chop, fried rice, and other soup items."}
{"text":"Great service, always love hearing them talk about Malaysia, I always learn something new! The laksa is authentic and delicious, I highly recommend eating it with rice noodles. The chicken wings and roti are also good. Come here for good homestyle comfort food."}
{"text":"Great place to read a book. Not super fancy, & seating could be better. Their food is crazy good and super authentic Malay. I love the Roti Canai it's a MUST! The pork chop lunch is crunchy @ @ $7.95 the price is right. Lunch with app and drink for under $15 bucks"}
{"text":"This is the only Malaysian restaurant in Arizona I think. Being from Indonesia, Malaysian food is almost remind me of home.  I had laksa soup for lunch today and it was delicious! I shared the roti canai/ appetizer with my husband , it was so yummy, we loved it! I also had the barley drink, it was so refreshing especially we just finished hike the comeback, it was perfect!  The waiter was very nice ."}
{"text":"Food was pretty authentic and service was awesome! I'll definitely go back here. I'm so glad they open in the valley"}
{"text":"First time trying Malaysian food and I'm not sure if I just don't like the cuisine that much or was just not impressed by the dishes. Came with a few friends and split the nasi lemak and Hainan chicken rice and I didn't think either of them was that memorable. The chicken had pretty good flavor but wasn't super tender!   The meals do come with either a barley or pineapple drink for 50 cents that's really good and I personally liked the barley drink more than the pineapple. My friends gave this place raving reviews from the first time they came but they ordered noodle dishes so I'll have to give this place another try!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with BP street Cafe. This was my first time having Malaysian food. I got the Chicken Curry and it was really good, there was no fried chicken in it. The chicken was really moist and the curry was very flavorful and not too hot. I got the Roti Canai and it was delicious as well. The owners were very friendly and the staff was helpful. I am planning on going back again."}
{"text":"Had a great visit.  Really loved the Firecracker chicken and Sambal Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Be sure to be here on wednesdays for their Wednesday special: braised chicken wings its is delicious.  Nasi lemak, pork chop rice, sambal fried rice, mee Siam are my favorites."}
{"text":"Me and one other went here for lunch today for the first time, first within the first minute or two of us being there we were asked if we were ready to order by 3 different people. We both got water and looked over the menu. When we had decided what we wanted, the waitress promptly got us our food and the service started to get better. After receiving our food the waitress and three others went on Facebook on the tablet they use as a register while we ate, not refilling our waters or checking in to see if we wanted anything else. Then after we waited for 20 minutes after we finished eating we walked to the front and asked for a bill so we could leave. They had to walk back to the table they were at to get the tablet and ring us out. The food was good, but it was the worst food service I have seen in a long time. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We visited this Malaysian cafe and have had such a great experience. The food we ordered, roti prata, hainanes chicken rice, Nasi lemak, cha Kway teow were authentic Malaysian and very tasty . The best part was the sambal from the Nasi lemak dish .... The other bit we enjoy is the friendliness of the owner Vanessa and her husband Carston. They were down to earth and very happy to share their menu w us. We found ur the chefs are the parents of Vanessa and are great cook for sure!  This place is a real gem and prices for all dishes are so affordable.  I highly recommend everyone craving for. Taste of Asian food especially Malaysian  dishes to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from Singapore so he was super excited to try this place out and introduce me to some of the Malaysian foods he grew up with. When we first went we tried the Laksa and the Chicken Rice. The chicken rice was alright, but the Laksa (noodle soup in a spicy coconut curry broth that includes shrimp, chicken, tofu, an egg, and bean sprouts) quickly became one of my favorites. Their seafood noodle soup is also really good if you're looking for a simpler, non-spicy noodle soup! My boyfriend is hooked on their sambal fried rice, which has a great kick to it, and their roti canai (served with a side of curry for dipping) is a great appetizer.  Almost everything we've tried so far has been great, and there are a handful of other items that we're looking forward to trying as well. The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food that you get, the staff is welcoming and friendly, and the service is quick! It's also fast and easy if you're looking for a takeout option as well :)"}
{"text":"As a Malaysian, I really enjoyed this place. Reminds me of my home country. The food is great.  The people are friendly. It is my go-to place when I crave some Malaysian food.  I recommend the Laksa, Nasi Lemak, Cha Qeuy Teau, Ice Kacang, well....everything....haha.   Oh yea...the roti canai.   Bring the Satey!!!"}
{"text":"BP Street Café                                          UPDATED REVIEW 1845 East Broadway Road, Suite 127 Tempe, AZ 85282  Our party of 17 arrived for dinner promptly at 6:00. As I had called in advance, they had tables ready for us immediately. A few of our guests had some minor problems with their chairs in that they had points on the metal which snagged some of the ladies tops. A quick exchange of most of the chairs solved the problem.  There are apparently 2 sets of menu's - the one which is on line and the one which was handed to us. The difference is that not all of the dishes are listed on the menu that is handed to you at the table. A number of us with smart phones went to their internet site and ordered from that.  Drinks were ordered around, and the consensus was that they were all very good. I had the Barley drink which is a bit unusual but with a wonderful flavor, and companion ordered the Thai Tea which was excellent.  Next were appetizers. The Roti Canai were flakey and tissue paper thin. They were served with a dipping sauce that had a piece of chicken and a potato in it. It was ever so lightly spicy, hitting the back of the palate a few minutes after eating it. We also ordered the BP Platter which consists of two of each of the appetizers with a chili dipping sauce. It consisted of chicken wraps (wrapped in aluminum foil with seasonings), spring rolls (delightfully crispy with good flavor), skewers of fish balls (unusually light), and two of the best chicken wings I personally have ever eaten. Had the wings been in buffalo sauce I would have thought them the best in the nation!  My first main course was the Sambal Fried Rice. It consisted of fairly ordinary fried rice with lots of egg in it and 4 small shrimp with the tail on. Flavor was a little smoky, but was definitely not on point. I also ordered the Mee Siam which is a chicken cutlet that is fried very crispy, and served with a small mountain of very thin rice noodles, several slices of cucumber, and a hard-boiled egg. This dish too was a big disappointment. The chicken was very overcooked, the noodles were so dry as to be inedible, and one would never get a hard-boiled egg in Malaysia, instead it would be a fried egg on top. No sauce was offered with the dish.  Companion ordered the BP Seafood over Rice. A large portion of white rice swimming in a sea of what looked like egg drop soup with 5 small shrimp in it and some artificial seafood. Companion complained that it was swimming in egg drop soup and it should have been thickened a whole lot. Companion also did not care for the dish itself, stating that the flavor was lacking.  Because of the experience of myself and companion, I polled the others at the table to get an idea of what they thought of the food.  Comments were: Chicken Curry and Rice - would have been good if the tofu had been left out Seafood Noodle Soup - very good Chicken Chop Noodle Soup - good Combo Fried Rice - fair - needed more flavor Hainan Chicken Rice - very good BP Ginger Chicken Rice - good Pork Chop Rice - great (Note: In Malaysia you would never get a pork chop as it is a Muslim country and pork is forbidden) Nasi Lemak - missing flavor and heat (this dish was evaluated by our person who has lived in Malaysia) Sweet and Sour Chicken - very dry and over cooked  Summation: There is no décor to speak of, though the place appears clean and well taken care of. One expects a bit of confusion with a party of this size, but this went far beyond what would or could be expected.  While some enjoyed their meal, the consensus was that the food was lacking in traditional Malaysian flavors and heat. I will go back again, to order a pile of the Roti and some more of the Barley drink.  I cannot in my conscience give the kinds of stars that others seem to be giving. Perhaps in the future, but not at this juncture. 3 stars for effort, cleanliness, and good portion size.  ======================================= This is a communication I received from the owner and in fairness to the review I felt it needed to be included.-------------------------  Malaysia is a multi-ethnic country; the main three ethnic groups are Malays (Muslim), Chinese (Buddhism/Christian) and Indians (Hinduism). We are serving Malaysian foods from these three ethnic groups. Therefore pork chop is on our menu since Malays is the only group do not eat pork but the other two do."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place, and the reviews on Yelp looked so good! I had to make the trip here. So, the service was great, everyone was super nice. The food was amazing. I ordered the Laksa with rice instead of noodles, the flavor was excellent. There's a little kick of heat to it, which I appreciated very well. However, the rice was a little underdone, but not a dealbreaker. Food was at a great price. I even had leftovers, which I had for lunch the next day. I added basil to it, which was one things I wish it had initially. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It is a family business place! The food is pretty good and the owner is very friendly. The price is acceptable! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few more dishes and have been very impressed with the food and the service. The owner is always so nice and friendly and I love how this is a family run operation. My latest favorites are the Mee Siam (Rice noodles with crispy chicken), roti canai (Crispy, chewy flatbread with curry sauce), and a seafood dish with flat noodles (Wat-Don Hoa). It can get a little warm in the dining room in the afternoon but their refreshing cool drinks will definitely cool you down. Upgrade one star!"}
{"text":"Overall, food flavor is rather mild and diluted, not intense enough. Especially the laksa. Also, did not give enough broth for the laksa, was kind of dry, disappointed! Well, I ordered it with rice noodles instead of the usual thick egg noodles. They should at least know that rice noodles tend to soak up broth more than egg noodles and give sufficient amount of broth when it is ordered with rice noodles.   Ginger chicken dish is nothing special, would not order again since I can do better at home.   Char kway teow was so-so, not exactly like the one you get in Malaysia.   Beancurd roll appetizer was meh, would be better if it were stuff with fish cake instead of meat.   My tea tarik was so diluted and not sweet, where is the condense milk?! Bandung drink was not bad, very refreshing, but flavor was also kinda mild.   Most of all, I do not like that their tipping options on their tablet is based on after tax, not before. Why in the world would I want to tip on tax?! This is not right and I'm not happy about that."}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic Malaysian food at an amazing price with a very friendly staff. Their menu is a little on the sparse side but I really appreciate that and the dishes are really well prepared. I was told by our waiter that their menu items are always changing so I'm really excited to go back.   We ordered the chicken curry and rice, Laksa, and Sambal fried rice along with the pulled tea and iced tea. The Laksa was incredible, they aren't skimpy with the seafood and the flavor was rich and delicious, everything was perfectly cooked, and came out hot. The chicken curry and rice had excellent flavor, although the chicken was a little dry, the tofu and potatoes were wonderful. The fried rice was amazing, it reminded me of my dad's except the Sambal sauce made it about twenty times better. And don't forget, the pulled tea is a must, it's the best pulled tea I've had in a long time. On top of all of that our bill came out to just over $25 despite having two dishes containing seafood making this place is an amazing deal! The staff was also really friendly and knowledgeable, my sister and I had a great time talking to our waiter about the food and restaurant.   Overall great food and environment, I'll definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Delicious foods, especially the Mee Siam and the sambal. Miss it so much. Amazing place and affordable prices though. It is definitely worth to try."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Support this place.  It's worth supporting.  It's a little out of the way and service can be uneven, but the food is well-executed and delicious.  Haven't had a lot of Malaysian food, only once before I moved to Arizona, so I can't say I'm comparing this to the best that may be out there.  Just going on taste and preparation.  On my first visit here I ordered the roti canai and the nasi lemak.  The roti was fine, maybe a tick above average.  I've had roti before many times and but never in this iteration and my only gripe was that the curry lacked a little flavor.  The nasi lemak was great.  Hot, crispy, and very filling.  Subtle in flavor, but with the sambal, kicked up the flavor and was quite tasty.  So tasty that I ordered it again on my next visit with my wife, who ordered the char kway teow.  Also good, reminiscent of chow fun.  Noodles could stand a little more chewiness but for a stir-fried noodle dish, it was pretty good.  Get the barley drink.  If you're familiar with Korean shik-ae, that's exactly what it tastes like and it's great.    Hoping one day they serve rendang."}
{"text":"Been under the weather over the weekend and figured I needed to get out and try some non-traditional meals with some spice to open up my body. I've driven by on multiple occasions, but never really had the time to grab lunch so today seemed fitting to give this place a go and it was definitely worthy of a return trip (I'd say once every 2 weeks for lunch). After my time spent in Penang I had been craving a lot of the foods but was lucky to get my fix via my coworkers home cooking... Since they moved away, that itch started back up.   Restaurant sits on the corner of the plaza which is nice as it opens up with plenty of seating and a TV looping some of the foods being prepared back in Malaysia. I have to admit, watching the video reminded me of my time spent.   I like how the menu is laid out with some simple letters/numbers (just like ordering food at the hawker stands).  I'm a big stir fry fan so char kuey teow was on the menu and we also got the Laksa Noodles & chicken wings. The coconut curry and seafood of the Laksa was on point seeing how you can ask for more heat, it's your choosing. We got mild so I can figure out if we were on the same page and yes we were.   Everything is hot and and made on the spot so you may get a bit of a delay if you ordered a few things, but we are talking about 1-2 mins max. I'm planning to put this place in my lunch rotation so I'll definitely be back again a few times over the next few months and given that I'm heading back to Penang later this year I plan to do a lot more sampling."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings!   Very flavorful food.  We ordered the chicken wings, Sambal fried rice and the bean curd roll (not on menu). We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Def authentic ! Love Malaysian food! Server was a little unprofessional and didn't remember the other people's order and only brought out mine . FYI when they say Spicy they aren't joking :) and I love spicy . Yay for Malaysian food"}
{"text":"Nice, family run business. I had the marinated pork with tofu and egg. The flavor was very rich. Next time I'll either go for the laksa or the curry!"}
{"text":"If you want legitimate Malaysian food, stop here to get your fix. Located in Tempe, this place has a host of very foreign drinks and dishes that might seem different to you. However, most of their menu is pretty tame and some would argue it's pretty average food.   I personally thought the drinks were very good and the dishes that were served were nothing special.  Taste Barley Drink - Think of the Barley Drink like boba except with popped barley at the bottom. The liquid is a sweet, sugary tea that has a semi-syrup like consistency. If natural boba was a thing, this would be number one on the menu. If you like a nutty, wheaty drink, this is for you.  Coconut Drink - They literally give you a shaved coconut, crack it open, and put a straw.  Bandang Drink - Bandang is a rose flavored drink that tastes very sweet yet has the background of rose. If you've never tried rose before, this may or may not be the drink for you.  Appetizer Plate (BP Platter) A very bland and standard sampler plate that contains spring rolls, chicken wings, foil chicken, and fish balls on a stick. It's not a bad sampler as the food was alright, but very underwhelming.   Nasi Lemak (Coconut Rice with Chicken) -- According to the menu, this is a The Coconut rice presented here makes the rice very light and fluffy with a hint of creaminess. It tastes more light than creamy but you can still feel a hint of coconut.  Roti Canal- Dervied from India, this was another appetizer. It's a small dish of dough served with a  spicy curry sauce. The dough is very light and fluffy and reminds me of a Chinese pancake.   Mee Sam (Chicken Cutlet)- A perfectly deep fried chicken cutlet paired with a lightly curried noodle dish. The chicken was amazing but I found the noodle portion underwhelming. The chicken was a perfectly battered and fried piece of meat that not only looked beautiful, but the bite into it had an excellent crunch. It was decently seasoned but could have been a bit more unique. Though the noodles were specialty   Curry Chicken Rice - I'd describe Malaysian Curry as something not so spicy and doesn't have the uniqueness of Thai or Indian. Maybe this place wasn't a very good impression.   Hainan Chicken Rice - The Coconut rice presented here makes the rice very light and fluffy with a hint of creaminess. It tastes more light than creamy but you can still feel a hint of coconut. The chicken served with this dish was a well-steamed chicken that tastes like a Chinese restaurant. The meat has a gingery oniony flavor like most steamed chicken.  Char Kway Teow (Noodle Stirfry) - What looks like a standard chow mein dish, this looked like a hunk of brown stuff on a plate. The dish was alright and had a nice spice but it seemed very simple to make and tasted like something you'd order at a Chinese restaurant. Judging by the ambiance of the place, you can tell, I believe that was the quality they were looking for. If you're a fan of Chow Mein with a little bit of spice, I'd recommend this dish.   Secret Menu: Lor Bak -Sausage wrapped in Bean Curd. This is a unique dish that would probably scare most unadventurous people. From what I understand it's a ground pork sausage wrapped in bean curd skins and deep fried. The results is a crispy sausage. The meat is very fine and lean and spiced well with anise and numbing spices. The bean curd brings a unique but delicious crispy texture when combined with the sausage. If you're adventurous, try this one out!  Ambiance BP Café is pretty shabby but it's roomy with a hint of yellow. I enjoy their HD TV which shows a powerpoint presentation of the dishes they serve here. I have noticed that it's mainly a takeout location.  Cost You can get a decently filling meal for under $10.00s. I highly recommend getting a drink here.  Overall If you're craving decent Malaysian food, you should go here. It does the job, but it's nothing spectacular. I would highly recommend the cool drinks from here."}
{"text":"Our first time here...The manager suggested we try the barley drink and  for mains we ordered a curry and a fried noodle dish. The barley drink was refreshing and comes with the order or main entree. The noodles were a bit dry for my taste and the curry seemed watery but I have only been to handful of Malay restaurants.   I would say they can add more drinks to menu like boba or smoothies, or malaysian white coffee. And they really need a picture menu. Also, maybe veggie options like salad.  It was hard to decide wt to order without the pictures  Overall, we enjoyed the service and would come back again  Pros: service, asian comfort food, free wifi Cons: no picture menu, lack of drink options"}
{"text":"I didn't know this restaurant existence until my brother in law told me. Loves the food and will be back there again...!"}
{"text":"Born and raised Singaporean here. I was so excited to find a Malaysian/Singaporean restaurant in Tempe. The service was phenomenal - could be because there weren't a lot of people at lunch time but they were very attentive to us.   I gave this place only three stars because I found the food to be very bland & diluted. I ordered the roti canai appetizer - $2.50 for one roti and a small cup of curry. The roti was pretty good. The curry, on the other hand, tasted very diluted. The consistency was very watery as well. I ordered the char kuay teow as my entree and it tasted ok. Wasn't the best. I don't know if I would come back again... maybe just to really satisfy my cravings as my last resort.   Note: this was my second visit. I wasn't too impressed after my visit but thought that I should give it another try."}
{"text":"Best wings ever ! I swear I don't go anywhere else for them and they're huge ! They're super meaty and crispy, they don't even need a sauce. Also great lunch spot, usually a pretty quick bye and the portions are very satisfying. Owners are great as well, super nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 8-9 times, and can say it has been awesome every time. I love love love the chicken wings, the teas are fantastic, and the food is reasonably priced and tastes great. The owners are always nice and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Malaysian food in town. I tried almost everything on their menu and I was never disappointed. Their laksa is a must try and you can choose to have  both rice and egg noodles in it.  Also, there is a fried fish they the owner says it's really ugly, it's not on the menu and taste super delicious,its something that you must have also.  Their service is always great and makes you feel comfortable. If there's anything you don't like, they will try to make it right for you.  Occasionally, they'll have some dish that is not on the menu and it's really good, sure to ask them for anything special."}
{"text":"My family is from Malaysia, and as a college student who grew up on traditional foods like laksa, at a certain point, you really do start missing the native tastes! A fateful Google search actually brought me to Bp Street.   The interior of the restaurant is very modern, and the entire vibe of it is laid back--perfect! Everything on the menu looked to be under $10 (I think the average price was $7.50 for entrees), so it is extremely affordable.   The food itself is super good! The menu does say that the owners are from Malaysia, so the tastes itself is very authentic (if not slightly americanized). The laksa didn't live up to my expectations, but it was good regardless. My sister ordered one of our favourite noodle dishes that my dad used to make (char kway teow), and we did order it extra spicy, but when it came out, it was more mild/not spicy at all (however, this could have been our fault because there WAS minor confusion between ordering and selecting the spice level).   I'll definitely come back, as it's location is pretty reasonable, the prices are phenomenal, and the customer service is super attentive. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try bp street since they opened. I have never had Malaysian food, so I didn't really know what to expect (and that may have been part of the problem). I finally went a few weeks back with the international supper club. The people who work here were accommodating, taking good care of our large group. The food, unfortunately, was not so awesome. I liked the little pancaky bread with the slightly spicy sauce... That was good. The laksa, on the other hand, was totally lacking. They billed it as a spicy soup, but it wasn't spicy at all. Additionally, I asked for no seafood and it had a ton of rubbery seafood in it. This being said, I might go back to try something else. The prices here were affordable and they had a wide variety of dishes. It's possible that this place is great and I just don't like Malaysian food... So that's something to consider."}
{"text":"Excellent service with good homestyle food.  Clean and friendly place.  I ordered their stewed pork.  Loved it."}
{"text":"LOVE this food!  Everything is hot and fresh, the spices are on point, the flavors are excellent! I love the fried rice with sambal, and the chicken curry.  You can ask for no heat, or extra heat, and they actually listen. I've never been inside the resultant, so I can't speak to that, but they deliver fresh, hot food, and I eat it often."}
{"text":"It was such a treat to find a Malaysian restaurant in Tempe, Arizona.  We were in nearby Chandler and decided to drive to Bp Street Café.  if you are wondering what Bp stands for, I figure it out!  It stands for Batu Pahat, a town in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.  It was neat to meet Malaysian and converse in our Hokkien dialect!  We ordered the following: - Laksa - good laksa broth - Char Kway Teow - pretty good! - Kway Teow Mee - also pretty good! - Hainan Chicken Rice - it was ok.  Rice was perfect.  Chicken needs to be more tender. - Ice Kacang - Ice could be a little finer.  Otherwise, pretty good.  Lots of Gula Melaka syrup.  If I'm ever back in Arizona, that's where I would hit up again."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends.  We each ordered a different dish and shared, which was great because it meant I got to try a lot of different dishes!  My favorites were the... oh no I forgot the name, but it was N8.  It was two different types of noodles, stir fried with egg, bean sprout, shrimp.  Basically like Pad Thai, but in a less sweet sauce.  I also liked the Laksa (I know I'm not spelling this right) although my friend ordered his super hot, and we still didn't think it was that spicy!  I recommend to order it with the rice noodles, because they are thinner than the regular noodles... and I just like it better that way for some reason.  I also ordered the seafood/noodle dish, which was N9.  It was good and the flavor reminded me of a Vietnamese soup dish.  I liked the veggie they used in the dish too, although I wish there had been more because they were really good.  My less favorite dishes were the ones with fried chicken.  They just didn't taste extremely special or have anything notable about them.  I would skip those next time.  I also note that all the eggs came out were overcooked (you can tell bc they had the gray ring around the yolk).  The eggs did not taste that good to me and were a bit rubbery bc of being overcooked.  I hope they work on not cooking the eggs as long in the future.  One thing to note is that our food didn't all come out at the same time.  This wasn't too bad because we all ate family style and shared everything.  But if you are with the type of people who won't eat until EVERYONE has their food... well, then your food is going to get cold waiting for everyone's food to come out.  A big plus is that I didn't see anything on the menu over $8, so definitely very affordable!  This seems to be a family-owned restaurant, as there was a little boy there riding his tricycle around the dining room and also at one point walking around without pants on (haha!).  I like to support local businesses, so I will probably be back here at some point."}
{"text":"I'm glad to find a Malaysian food place in AZ. I have fond memories of eating Roti and Laksa from living in New York. I'm glad there's a place to get the fix here.   The Roti wasn't as flaky as I remembered but it was delicious and chewy nonetheless. It's served with small bowl of savory chicken curry.   The bean curd roll was my favorite from this meal. It tasted like a cross between a egg roll and sausage. It had mild taste but served with hot dipping sauce. Very good dish to share.  The Laksa was served in a large bowl with lots of shrimp, fish balls, squid and chicken. The flavor was decent, slightly watered down version of chicken curry. We had it with rice noodles but I would want to try it with egg noodles next time.  The restaurant was really clean including the restrooms. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First time trying Malaysian food. Figured it would be close to Thai and I was correct. Definitely worth checking out. All of the food was excellent. Good spice level and variety of choices, from different meats noodles rice and curry. Very friendly helpful service. Will definitely be coming back. Also very inexpensive. Everything is around $7 or $8 an entree."}
{"text":"My Chinese Foodie friend told me NOT to come here, the food wasn't good, \"the mother doesn't know how to cook\".  My friend got mad at me, cos I didn't listen to her, and take her word for it.  But I wanted to make my own conclusion, with my own taste buds.   So, I came here March 25, 2017, with a Foodie MeetUp of 8 people.  I shared three dishes with 2 other people.  We ordered the recommended Malaysian dish according to the Malaysian sever, N1 Laksa noodle soup with both rice and egg noodles, R12 seafood over rice $8, Marinated pork R18 $8. All three dishes were REALLY, REALLY BORING !!!  One of my dining companions sharing our food rated our choices half a star.  I rate same, due to blandness.  All three of us said it was really bland.    The marinated pork R18 was dark, looked salty but was incredibly bland, including the soup.  R12 seafood over rice was mostly rice and cornstarch gravy with no taste.   Oh so bland!  We asked for soy sauce AND salt, right away.  Hurry, hurry, can't wait to get the soy sauce and hot sauce to liven up our food.    I also tasted the A3 foil wrapped chicken, eh, nothing that I would order again.    Tasted the N8 Kway Teow Mee - it was the best thing of the entrees that the 8 ordered.  It was like Chinese chow fun.    Also tasted the ginger chicken rice $7.  It was just OK. N10 Mamak Mee Goreng $7.50 was OK, too.   It seems the the dark sauce dishes are the least bland.    I wanted truly authentic Malaysian food, but our server said really, only N1 Laksa was Malaysian.  The rest of the menu is mainly Chinese food, as they (the family) are Malaysian Chinese.  If I want Chinese food, there are plenty of places to go where the food is way tastier.    The food fortunately isn't expensive, mostly around $7.50 - $8.00, so if you don't like it, at least you didn't pay $12.    Bathroom was clean, service got the job done without anything worth mentioning, so I give it 2 stars, and second star for the dark dishes that had more flavor.  No one rated their food higher than 3.5, the 3.5 were the people who ordered the darker sauce dishes.    Plenty of better places for me to spend my money and time at, worth more, to me.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Came here many times for the great food made by a true home chef (ama!) . Try the nasi lemak. The fried chicken thigh will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Super authentic.  Probably the only place in Arizona.  Family-owned restaurant run by Malaysians from Batu Pahat.  The grandparents cook old school Malaysian favourites.  We tried the Nasi Lemak, Laksa, and Roti Canai.  I personally didn't taste the Roti Canai but everything else was taste of home.  If you miss Malaysian food, come here and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, family-owned and -operated restaurant. Most dishes have varying spice levels available, and all dishes we have tried are delicious (noodle dishes, rice dishes, and appetizers)."}
{"text":"My friend invited me to this place today. Excellent did and service. I'm still thinking of the noodle soup and tasty drink. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the folks delightful.  This was my first visit to a Malaysian restaurant, so I was conservative with my order, laksa, a delicious chicken-y soup with rice noodles and perfect seasoning.  I can hardly wait to visit this cafe again, and I'll go for something more adventurous."}
{"text":"This is a family owned business ... Literally. The daughter and grand son are severing the customers. Mom and dad are cooking in the kitchen. This is my first time trying Malaysian food and apparently this is the ONLY Malaysian restaurant in the valley. Nothing is better than home cook food made with home recipe.  We ordered many different types of authentic drinks and dishes. I love the appetizer with the fried bread dip in the curry sauce. I enjoy their chicken dish but the chicken is a bit dry. Other than that, I love the presentation and side dishes. If you enjoy spicy food, this is the place to go.   Owner stopped by to check up on us. She is super friendly. Service is great and the constantly stop by to check up on us for refill. I'll definitely come back here again to try other dishes."}
