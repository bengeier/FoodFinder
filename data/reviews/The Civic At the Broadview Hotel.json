{"text":"Beautiful venue but overpriced food. My boyfriend and I went over the weekend. I loved the decor and service was overall fine. We had a salad and the croquettes to start. Both were very good. For mains I had the steak and he had halibut, sides are ordered separately (which always bothers me when you pay 30$ for the entree alone). My boyfriend didn't like his fish too much. My steak was ok, the sides were a bit of a disappointment (potatoes and the carrots). Overall and okay experience, but prices seemed over inflated for the food. You are definitely  paying for the ambience. For a better food experience go to Maple Leaf Tavern just a bit further east."}
{"text":"We enjoyed or dinner and drinks at the bar. The vibe was lively without being annoyingly loud. The bartenders were good and attentive and the food was quite good without being mind blowing. All above average for sure and worth trying. It's amazing to see how the building has transformed."}
{"text":"Ambience was great, attentive server, waiting for our table we were left lingering in the lobby, a bit odd. Very loud, poor acoustics, so not the place for intimate conversation, more of a place to be seen. We had the cod, scallops and rabbit, very pedestrian, poor presentation, no wow factor in both flavour and plating, the rabbit was tough and stringy.  Don't go for the food, go to see and be seen."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch as we couldn't get a spot on the roof terrace. The food and drinks were great, nice coffee nice selection of wines and the food is very creative and tasty. The only thing that was so so was the pastry, it was good but nothing to write home about. It's definitely worth going and it's all very moorish."}
{"text":"We checked out The Civic recently for an anniversary dinner. And boy we are glad we did.  What a nice addition to this neighborhood.  Staff are friendly and courteous.  Wonderful ambiance.   We had oysters to start.  Ordered a nice bottle of red.   Hubby had the rib steak and I had the duck.  Note: Sides are extra.  We had the potato's and mushrooms.   The entire meal was excellent.   It is more on the high end side but worth every penny.    The hub's steak was a pretty good cut, so he actually brought some home!  If you are looking for a special occasion spot or a great quality meal - do check it out.  Wonderful to see how they turned this corner into a happening spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner from start to finish!  The lobster was divine and so was the elk.  Sides were  excellent including the beets, potatoes and carrots (to die for).  Lemon tart was fabulous too.  Service was also top notch.  The room is beautifully restored.  5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"The restaurant has very nice d√©cor.  Ambience is ok,  shame there was no cool music playing. The bar area is inviting. We ordered the Milk Bun appetizer special. First of all tiny little milk buns were stale and not even warm.  Ungenerous portion. They made them the day before and thought people wouldn't notice? The waitress was lovely and removed them from our bill...rightfully so....this type of thing should have been a complimentary item sent to all tables. Waldorf Salad was nice but dressing was lacking in flavour even with the stilton involved. Again it seemed the kitchen went cheap and only used a fractional amount of stilton in making the dressing. I only got three walnut halves on mine. Hardly the right proportion for the amount of lettuce. Again chef being cheap. We also had the Winter Tagliatelle. At $20 for this there was a tiny amount of actual roasted squash which is a main component of this dish. Squash is cheap to use and you can afford to be copious with it. There were about two tablespoons of  unseasoned squash on this dish. The poor vegetarian in your group goes hungry..... Duck confit was prepared nicely but the chef invented some sort of burnt lemon puree which I'd reckon he hasn't tried because it was odd and bad and didn't really go with anything on plate. Beef tenderloin was just good. Good as beef tenderloin is. The waitress was lovely and service was friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"It's a pretty restaurant (much like the rest of the hotel) but food is mediocre for the prices that are being commanded. I had the kale salad which was great, half chicken for dinner. First few bites were good but the breast was dry.  Service was my biggest problem. We waited, and waited and waited for pretty much everything. We were going to order dessert and didn't bc it took to damn long for our waiter to pay attention. Wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered the Broadview Breakfast and Omelette Frites.  Broadview Breakfast had a tiny amount of the pork rosti and one of the poached eggs came hard boiled. The omelette has cheese inside which comes cold (I asked if that's the way it's supposed to be) so it doesn't melt in the omelette, but instead makes the omelette cold.  They also don't have lactose free milk for coffee drinks.  I wouldn't go back. Service is slow, food is mediocre and prices are high."}
