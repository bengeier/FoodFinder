{"text":"OMG!!! Hands down one of the best kept secret buffets. $6.99 Lunch $9.99 Dinner Everything is just delicious."}
{"text":"We came in with low expectations because of both the price and the location, but were disappointed nonetheless. They advertise a varied selection including Italian, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican, international and a couple of others, but just about all the dishes are as American as you can get. The sliced meat was generally dry, the cheesecake was definitely made from a powder mix, the fruits were okay. All around a pretty poor experience, not much negative to say about the service however.   If you're looking for a cheap buffet, sure swing by here but honestly even at the price it is far from worth it. You'll be better off at Denny's or some other dinner for the value."}
{"text":"This buffet located at the Fiesta Station in Henderson. It Has a good selection of food that I would rate maybe three stars,but I will give the deserts a five ,also the price is five stars. This certinly isn't one of the better buffets ,nor is it the worst,but it's well worth the price.If your in the area give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this buffet. How can you go wrong with the price as it is. The breakfast buffet is great! I go here too often. The staff seems friendly and it seems to be accepting of family as well. The only thing I wished they change is there policy on kids 2 and older all must pay the same price as an adult. My 2 year old doesn't eat much and charging the same as an adult seems a little much but I'm still a fan. Love the Fiesta Henderson Festival buffet! ;-)"}
{"text":"The price is why i choose to eat there. 6.99 for lunch was very pleased with the food. Like the mashed potatoes not instant lovely red potatoes liked yhe gravy. Loved the turkey that they slice in front of you. Missing the stuffing then it be like thanksgiving all over again. Ha! Liked the wonton soup. Liked the cheesecake and liked picking little bit of everything .  Here and there. I would come back."}
{"text":"We tried the Feast at Fiesta Henderson in early April: Awful!!! Go somewhere else... The Feast at Sunset Station in great."}
{"text":"wow you get what you pay for... So the manager site my wife and I in the corner where they didn't have a server to take are drinks or clean off the table when we got a second plate. then the rice was heard, and the chicken was dry, ok they gotta have something!  so I compromised and went for the Mongolian. BINGO it was good or maybe it was just because my taste buds had already been let down that I wanted it to taste good. what Im  saying is you get what you pay for, if you only have a few bucks and don't want micky dees, then the buffet at the fiesta Henderson is the place for you..."}
{"text":"Would give 5 stars to the Mongolian and dessert sections. The rest of the selection isn't that great but u can't beat $6.99 for a lunch buffet! The Mexican is good too! Like I said, I would FOR SURE recommend going just because the Mongolian and dessert is so good!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, think of the buffet Clarke and Eddie eat at on Vegas Vacation...ok, maybe not that extreme, but pretty close."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of the food, not sure why there is such a discrepancy between the different Station/Fiesta casinos...take my word for it and drive a few miles north to the Boulder Station!!"}
{"text":"I became sick from the Tilapia today. The waitress called over the manager & she bullied me into her own belief that the fish was fresh?  I became immediately I'll & vomited in the Restroom. We were not treated like guests & I have never become ill during a meal.  It was embarrassing & the service we received was horrendous!!"}
{"text":"I want to personally thank Richard the manager over the slots machines for the complimentary buffet on 11/4/17! He made us feel very welcomed! Me and a group of my friends came to get food and it was absolutely great! What a wonderful time we had! Thank you again! We will be back again soon! Hope to see you! Cedric!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a big fan of buffets but for the way I eat now - this one is a terrific choice. I personally like this buffet specifically for the Mongolian Grill. In addition to the traditional veggies and meats they offer a huge variety of sauces and flavorings -- even roasted garlic cloves!   Also loved the fish -- not dried out like fish I've tried at many other buffets.   The prices are extremely reasonable and you save more with a player's club card from the casino.   I had an event nearby at Lake Las Vegas, so my husband even went back for dinner. It's not a gourmet high-end buffet and aside from the Mongolian Grill, they don't have a huge variety of items on the buffet itself  but what they do, they do well. And it's a great value. Good service, too."}
{"text":"The Mongolian grill is all we can eat here. Unfortunately, the grill guy was beyond rude. My wife gave him her bowl & received no noodles upon grilling. He rolled his eyes at her and said, \" You didn't tell me nothing...Put chow mein over there.\"  My turn came up and I ordered the same thing. He clearly sabotaged the dish and it was swimming in sauce. It was beyond salty...Like he was! The manager was kind enough to offer walking up with us to make it right but this does not coach and correct a bad employee with a bad attitude. He may spit in our food! They're probably union so what can we do? Shame on Stations for such low standards of service."}
{"text":"So we decided to take advantage of the Two for the price of one coupons sent to us and had lunch at the buffet (party of 4). After we passed the smoke filled casino, things got better. We were quickly seated and the hostess was very pleasant (with smiles). Our waitress \"Sylvia\" was extremely nice and very attentive. We never had to ask for refills on our drinks and she removed our dirty plates quicker than any other buffet we have experienced. The food was good. I found nothing to be old or dry. Everything was quickly replenished by the cooks. There were plenty of good choices in every category. The desserts were exceptional as well...also with plenty of choices! All of the staff was wonderful. We will definitely be returning again and again. The reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the smoke from the casino floor tends to wander into the dining area and is unpleasant while trying to eat. Otherwise, great place to eat and I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Out of all the station casinos, this is the worst. We have given it a few tries to redeem itself. I feel bad if people come to LV and they think this is an example of buffets. The food is gross. Each time we've been there, it looks like leftovers. The food is not freshly cooked. It's been sitting there too long. The salad bar has no selection. We're done giving it a try. We'll drive a tad farther to Sunset Station. I advise everyone to do the same"}
{"text":"I love the sections of food (American, Mexican, Asian, etc..), I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I feel like I should vomit.  I am not a fan of buffets, especially cheap ones.  I unfortunately am stranded at the fiesta and needed dinner.  I read the reviews and the Mongolian grill sounded doable, love Mongolian grill elsewhere.  Wrong, it's cheap, it's greasy, and not something I enjoyed.  If you want an excellent buffet go to the strip, preferably wicked spoon."}
{"text":"Where to start? Hawaii buffet for 12.99 with players card good deal right? Nope the food was horrible. First off poi was definitely frozen and not fresh and those little serving cups made it ridiculous.  I had to grab 9 of those to fill a small bowl. The poke fish was the same and I swear there was more onions than fish. The spam fried rice was to me the highlight of the dinner. The bbq pork was pretty good if it was from the fresh batch. Apparently they do not know the difference between roast pig and kalua pig. They basically had a pig that looked liked it was hacked with an axe. No shredded pig whatsoever and being it was just randomly hacked the meat was dry.  On one of the flyers at the door laulau is mentioned. When I asked where was it they said they don't serve that there. So let's move onto the sweet stuff.... The malasadas is definitely no Leonards but my suggestion to you is eat it hot. Once it cools you may chip a tooth. The pineapple upside down cake was ok but how can you really mess that up? Now as for the haupia. Oh my I'm guessing way too much cornstarch. I couldn't stop laughing. I picked it up and it bounced off my plate like a ball. The waitstaff was nice though they kept serving us flat soda even after I mentioned it.  But what's the saying? You get what you paid for.... well I feel robbed. My suggestion take your 12 bucks and eat at a regular Hawaiian restaurant or better yet wait till Saturday pay more and do the Silvertons Hawaiian buffet, way worth the 20 bucks. All I know is I'm gonna ask for a partial refund since all I really ate was rice."}
{"text":"Awful,  you get what you pay for and these Fiesta hotels have cheap buffets with even cheaper food.  Everything was over done, over salted or bland. They definitely cater to the senior set that have no taste buds left. Don't even waist your time or money."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful buffet... I tried it with a group of friends today, and this place is just absolutely awful. The food is just bad, service is even worse... The only good thing here is the price but it's just not worth it.   Stay away from it at all costs!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a basic \"meat & potatoes\" casino buffet. It's fairly large for the smaller size of the property and the layout actually has some visual appeal. It's a great value for a weekday lunch and it seems to be reasonably well-run. There's no weekday breakfast here. The d√©cor is okay but looks worn. The place was very busy when I was here for lunch. There's no gourmet selection but you should be able to satisfy a lunch appetite with a surprisingly wide variety of choices. Table service was spread thin but floor workers were trying to keep everyone happy. The salad area had a picked-over selection. The foods I ate had okay taste and okay quality. Hispanic foods were above average, Italian foods below average. It serves to the preferences of its regular customers without going over or even near the top. I'd have no problem visiting here again for lunch"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Mongolian Section of the buffet line. Choose your ingredients and let the cook know which meat & sauce you'd like. Choose from Beef, Chicken or Shrimp, or just ask for all of them  The rest of the food leaves much to be desired. Usually cold or lacking flavor. Aside from the Mongolian and dessert I usually skip all other offerings here. Prices are reasonable and you can get a buy-one-get-one coupon for having a players card. If you're in the mood for something more reliable I'd recommend Sunset Station's Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars only because most of the food seems old like 1 day or something.  For example, fried chicken tastes like refried chicken, Mexican food and hot dog is dried up and tastes old and weird.  You can tell something's not right. Salad dressing is scary.  IDK how they get away with it.  Only thing I'll eat is pizza, dessert bar and Mongolian (live stir fry) where the grumpy Asian dick guy cooks.  Although, other Asian male employees are cool and nice there.  Dude, if you don't like your job, then get a new one!!  Grumpy needs to be fired.  He looks like he's mad as hell at everyone."}
{"text":"Really good food and choices for a buffet and for $10.99 there's no way i could complain! Good variety of healthy vegetables to choose from also.. baked yams,squash,zuccini,broccoli,beets etc... Especially enjoyed the mongolian station and the mexican station,  good potato brocolli soup on the salad bar. Would highly recommend this place if your in the area great service too very friendly!"}
{"text":"I actually thought this was a good value, and a solid place to eat.  Came here as part of a package tour and was pleasantly surprised.  Service was good, the lunch buffet was more than adequate.  They have an international theme to the buffet with various \"ethnic\" stations and that sets it apart from just an American buffet.  Did the Asian stations have food that tasted genuine to their respective culture?  Not on your life, but who cares?  The price was very reasonable for what you got and the variety was welcome.    This Hotel rooms are for tourists, but the casino and restaurant are actually geared towards the locals (notice the pictures on the walls of all the Casino's big winners).  It is not a \"strip\" experience.  The locals want an affordable place to eat and then gamble and that's what this place provides.    Once again, if you crave fine-dining, look elsewhere, but if you are just the typical average American, this place is right up your alley."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this is the worst station owned buffet.  the selection is very limited. food dried out but still on the line. empty foods aren't replenished unless you ask. won't visit again"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I'm spoiled by the best rated local buffet - the pricier but definitely better Studio B buffet at the M resort. Sure the Festival buffet at Fiesta is only $9.99 for dinner and $7.99 for lunch but you can get a pretty decent meal for that much at the local In-n-Out. Don't get me wrong, the festival buffet is acceptable for the price one pays but as they say 'you get what you pay for'.  Drinks - I got the $1 margarita. Yep, it tasted like a $1 margarita. It was definitely a premix, not something a bartender could have prepared. If it was prepped by a bartender, shame on you mister! Food - At first glance, the place looked like it had a well stocked buffet. There were the usual sections - international, asian (not sure how that's not international), italian, american, etc. My two big gripes with the food at this buffet were - a) each section had barely 3-4 dishes, 5 tops. b) the food didn't look or taste the freshest. I imagine they do a lot of 'pre-prepped' food. In Gordon Ramsey speak that's effing b*llsh*t.  Most sections had passable food. My favorite section turned out to be the Mongolian BBQ section. This was a delight and I compliment the chef (me...cuz that's what a Mongolian BBQ is....you pick your food, pick your sauces and the 'cook' heats it up for you). The burgers in the American section were soaked in what I'm guessing was a container of disposed-off engine oil. The ravioli had puss-filled acne...or was it supposed to be cheese? The ribs were meh...head on over to Tony Roma's or Famous Dave's to know how ribs should taste. Pizza was decent. The best thing I ate here was the chocolate ice cream for dessert.  Conclusion - If you're really hungry and don't want to spend a lot head on over to the Festival buffet at Fiesta. If you're looking for a Vegas buffet worth remembering, look elsewhere.  PS: Servers were friendly and attentive. My only gripe is with the food here (and maybe the set they borrowed from that 40s movie for decor)."}
{"text":"Congratulations on getting my 1st one star review. The food in this buffet is terrible. It always seems to be bland and wrong.  The fried food tastes like its been under a heat lamp all day. Sometimes the meat is tough, sometimes its dry, but usually never just right.   I actually made a vow to never eat here again, even with free comps. It's that bad. If you want something cheap and decent, check out the Denny's just a few steps away."}
{"text":"good menu for saint patricks day..food was cold in certain sections. the waitress was slow to clear tables.if your looking for a buffet on a budget and don't care about flavor than this would be what you are looking for..."}
{"text":"Comparing this to other Station Casino buffets, this one is by far the lowest of the bunch. We occasionally get 2 for 1 coupons for this place, and even then, it is not worth returning. The decor is very worn and dated. The options are pretty limited, and international cuisine was a joke.  Honestly, take the 7 minutes to drive down to Sunset Station and get a much better experience, and much better food for about the same price."}
{"text":"One of the better local casino buffets. Better than Sunset Station (slightly cheaper, more variety and better taste)  You can't go to a local casino buffet, pay less than $10, and expect your dining experience to comparable to that of a casino buffet on the strip.  That said, there is more variety than expected of local casino buffets. Food is okay. Some items taste better than others. It's a buffet... take a little of what you want to try, if it tastes good, get more, if not, just let the server take it away. Have fun with the cheap food.  One plus was the Mongolian grill. You choose your ingredients, hand it over to the guy, and he cooks it right there for you on the large grill. Add rice, noodles, whatever carb you want that you can find in the buffet, or not.  One negative, it's location. Local casinos, especially, smell horribly of smoke. You just can't avoid it here in LV. When you exit upon stuffing yourself with food, your hair, clothes, all wreak of smoke. Just a heads up.  Usually no lines at all.  Servers are very attentive and sweet.  A great choice if you're hungry and looking for a variety cheap food and dessert."}
{"text":"Good food for the price, especially the desserts. I liked it, I don't know why the others reviews say it was gross, but it was pretty good. The line to the buffet was short, and it was inexpensive. I think that the desserts were the best though. The waitresses were nice and served us quickly.  Overall, I think it is a pretty good buffet!"}
{"text":"Superb staff, clean, and quality food at a great price.  If your nearby this is the place for the entire family."}
{"text":"Not a big buffet eater, however was at the Fiesta casino and was hungry.  Buffet is on the 2nd floor of the casino, not elaborate, but not pricey.  With casino card buffet is about $6, I do not know where you can get juice, coffee, a full meal and desert for that price, I had turkey with a pineapple sauce, which I thought was quite tasty; also bbq chicken on a roasting spit on the day I was there. Ample selection of salads and dressings, pizza which I had a slice, not bad at all.  There was a ample selection of deserts, pies, cookies, pastries and off to the side soft serve ice cream.  You can stop at the cheesecake factory and get a cup of coffee for 1/2 the price.  You decide."}
{"text":"The Festival Buffet appears to have a huge selection but when you head off with your empty plate and start looking around you see that there is not much to it.  It's cheap food is accompanied by it's cheap price."}
{"text":"I saw the $5.99 lunch promo they have going and it has been a while since we've been here, so we thought sure why not check it out the deal for the ACYE buffet.  Well  it's pretty standard buffet fare.  The only thing I really liked was the bbq pulled pork, collard greens, brussel sprouts from the Bar-b-que station.  The pork was seasoned nicely and tender, I made myself a pulled pork sandwich out of it.  So that alone was worth the price of lunch already.    The Mongolian stir fry on the other hand I only took one bite. The meat was tough.. I can deal with that, but the cook drowned it in way too much sauce (which was too salty for me). Even the waiter who took that plate away looked at it and made a remark about it.  I do like the option that you can get brown rice. That was nice. They also had  fresh chopped ginger and garlic plus other veggie options you can add for your stir fry.   Next time though I'll stick with the sweeter and lighter teriyaki sauce that my husband chose for his stir fry. His creation turned out and tasted better than mine.    The salad pickins and dressings were your standard selections. I only saw one station that qualified as a salad bar.  The other station had the condiments. The dessert selection was okay.  They had pies, little slices of cakes and display case of pastries. They also have sugar free options too.  It's not the out of this world sweets treats, but the make your own ice cream sundae bar will do the trick and make any kid happy.    Service and ambiance was fine. The place was clean. It wasn't too crowded. Just a short wait to be seated. The servers kept their buffet stations clean and food fresh. The salad station was kept cold and always filled.  The meats and side dishes were hot to luke warm though. Our waiter was friendly and refilled our drinks and kept our table clear.  This is a pretty decent buffet and it's a great value for what it's worth. I'd take family here and they would be happy with it.  They have a breakfast promo too, I think I might try that next!"}
{"text":"Terrible buffet, terrible selection.  From the outside, it looks huge, but there is probably only one good food per station.  In addition, the international selections were pitiful.  Not enough meat, and mostly unpleasant.  The BBQ station only served roast turkey.  To be fair, I came here during the lunchtime, I don't know how the dinner selection varies.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We used to come here because of the cheap price and the hubby likes the Mongolian grill best of all the buffet grills, but finally it took me three trips to find something edible, so I usually veto it now.  This is pretty much the issue w all feast buffets now.  They will lower the price, lure you back in, start increasing a dollar or two and decreasing the quality level.  Rinse and repeat every three years."}
{"text":"For the price you really can't complain but if you're expecting something better than dorm food, prepare to be disappointed.  My wife and I scored a discount on the AYCE buffet with our boarding pass cards and everything looked good from far away. Once I took my first bite, I knew right away that the cost of admission was cheap for a reason. The food pretty much lacked flavor - whether it was a taco, pizza, mac and cheese, or fries. Things you can't really screw up. The spanish rice that went with my tacos was dry. No bueno.  Service was about average.  If you want a cheap buffet, keep your expectations low and you'll be fine. If you want better, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's one of my other go-to Station Casinos Buffets. I love their beef stroganoff and their salad bar is completely stocked with boiled eggs, beats, green beans, the works. Some other buffets do not have the complete condiments that go with salad bars. The staff are all friendly and courteous. Their desserts are delicious."}
{"text":"I have been there twice this week and was not disappointed.  I am limited as to what I can eat right now due to dental surgery, but there was a good selection for me to choose from.  The Swai fish was delicious!  The stuffing also has an outstanding taste!   Above all else, the service was top notch!  I never had to wait for a drink refill, and the table area and surrounding tables were cleaned right away.  The staff was very friendly and I will go there again."}
{"text":"Whoa! Reading all these buffet haters comments. I mean, yes it is a \"dated\" hotel and the buffet is \"dated.\" But if you were looking for Wynn class buffet, then go there.   Festival Buffet does what it needs to do, it feeds you for cheap. Everything that I had there was great and the buy one-get one coupon makes the deal even better. The waiters have always been kind and attentive to me, so what is there not to love? I am a equal opportunity buffet eater and Festival Buffet is okay by me!"}
{"text":"This place has changed! Me and my boyfriend went for lunch it was 4 min before 12 and the lady charged us for the brunch and we didn't have an amigo card. She could've just told us to wait a few minutes for the lunch so it's cheaper . ....On top of that the food was COLD, and REPULSIVE.  Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Saw a lot of mixed reviews but honestly I didn't agree. First off the buffet was reasonably priced probably because I received an admission discount all you can eat for $10 isn't bad. The food was great and waitress Ana was awesome. She kept the mimosas coming and was very friendly offering her personal testimony about being 200lbs and lost most of her weight walking to help customers if you see her ask about her personal story can't miss the petite Asian woman she's pretty funny too.  The breakfast option was basic pass on the powdered eggs and go straight for the hot n fresh omelette that can be order on the spot with a variety of fresh toppings. The food was seasoned well and my crew even got a personal visit to our table from the cook.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only good thing about this buffet is the price, assuming you have a 2-for-1 coupon. With those 2-for-1 coupons, it becomes cheaper than a meal at Del Taco. So while Del Taco might be tastier, it costs less here and you, technically, get more.  The salad bar is sad. So sad. Saddest little salad bar that I've ever seen.  They serve Mountain Dew! This was indeed one of the biggest highlights for me.  Besides the Mountain Dew, dessert was my favorite thing. There's a standard vanilla and chocolate dispensing machine and there's several toppings to go with it, including mini M&Ms. M&Ms!    It's broken into sections, like most buffets - American, BBQ, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, International, etc. I truly found not a single good thing to eat. It was fine, as in it was edible. But none of it was actually qualify as good.  If you want to add a steak or crab or an alcoholic drink to your buffet meal, you order it and pay for it up front when you purchase your buffet entrance.  The decor is unremarkable. The staff were friendly and pleasant. It is kept up nicely and clean and all that."}
{"text":"One of the Top 5 WORST buffets I've experienced.   Me and my boyfriend didn't think much of this place. The people running it are rather blase' about the whole thing, not very attentive to the customer. The food was very \"cafeteria\" as my boyfriend says. I'll eat almost anything, but this was Dumpsville from the proverbial 'get-go'.   The orange chicken from the Asian section was mushy... mushy? How do you make orange chicken mushy? Well, the Fiesta found a way to do it. Much of the entire buffet seemed to be just splattered across the serving stations, like throwing a can of paint across a canvas and signing your name to it.  Nothing special at the lunch buffet, just all the standards you can think of... mashed potatoes, fried rice, a couple of hams screaming for their lives at the carving station, and therein lies the metaphor which probably best fits this basically generic buffet --- the 'best' items on the line were the standards.  My boyfriend liked the fried chicken the best while I gorged on the all-beef hot dogs. Other little annoyances are things like asking for another glass of milk and not getting it. Our server was talking with The Manager who \"pulled her aside\". I guess he felt that his business was more important than the customers.  Extra tidbits: the shelled mussels were ok, if not particularly hot, and there were about 5 or 6 different kinds of dinner rolls. Never got to the soups because they were inconviently placed around the room, but they were strictly standards (there's that word again).... chicken noodle, sweet pea.... zzzzzzzzzz  And now for the big question: Would I ever go back to eat here again? Well, that's a toughie..... um..... let's just say I would return if I ran out of gas in that part of town, I was absolutely famished, and my sunglasses had mud on them so I couldn't see that I was re-entering the Fiesta.... otherwise, NO!"}
{"text":"The festival buffet at the Fiesta Henderson is not so bad. It's $10.99 pp for dinner. I was in line to pay and saw you can add on a 1/2 pound of snow crab legs for $6, so I did just that. You could also get a full pound for $12. You get a ticket that shows you paid for the legs and you take it to the Mexican station where they are prepared for you. They come with a side of warm liquid butter, a lemon wedge and a crab cracker to break the legs. Snow crab legs don't have a lot of meat and it's a lot of work to get the meat out, but I enjoyed them and for the price I would get them again.   Some things on the buffet line were definitely a hit or miss. I stayed away from the Mexican and Chinese stations because many items were for sure not fresh. I had a salad that had fresh lettuce and veggies, some watermelon, beef and barley soup and some sliced roast beef with au jus that was good. I also had some freshly grilled veggies, noodles and shrimp from the Mongolian station which was very good also. That alone was worth the money for the buffet. I wouldn't say this is the best buffet in town or even the top 10, but it's certainly not horrible and I would come back."}
{"text":"Sustained poor dirty food splattered Chairman area seating regardless of all the managers that I have personally asked to chat with, breakfast noon or evening. It's all poor. For example today, taken to a dirty table where placements had not been removed; asked to move where a table was already set up (not busy at all). Taken to another set table however wet chair and food on both seats, trash on floors but better than food all over the floor as the table before and another beside us with a hunk of food plus debris. Filthy paper wedges under tables to even them out.  Food droppings where you pick up clean plates. Food lines with mislabeled items: example Waffle sign but Talipia in dish, no added sugar vanilla sign is not there, but that's what they say it is! Just says non fat. If so, then no ice cream for diabetics, etc. spoke to another male manager who says he's going to let Rose his manager know. However Rose has never gotten this! Spoke and shown her 6 times, emailed and she can't get it!"}
{"text":"Been here several occasions over the years and a friend of mine lived literally two blocks away.  The food here isn't great but it also isn't bad.  What it is is filling.  The fried chicken was on point and the rest of the food, including dessert was worth the price I paid, which was nothing.    The decor of the buffet as well as the casino is dated but that's fine with me.  The seating needs to be replaced as the vinyl was cracked and actually a bit sharp to the touch.  Service was excellent though.    The place does get busy since it is inexpensive so plan on getting here early.  It is off the strip but mostly locals come here for the ease of not having to cook at home and clean up.  Its been a while since I've visited but I'll probably drop by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Save your money! Even with a 2 for 1 coupon it was not worth it. Travel down the 215 and hit Green Valley, same price and tremendous quality and variety."}
{"text":"This place is okay,  nothing special.  The food reflects the price. The wait staff are are usually pretty fast and the line to get in is usually pretty short"}
{"text":"This was our second time trying this buffet, and AGAIN it was just OKAY. Either the food was too salty, or too bland. Will not be coming back again. The quality of food there was a 5/10. Customer service was great though! Now if only they can make their food taste better."}
{"text":"I wrote a review a few months ago, and now would like to amend it and can't find it...so  I feel it is important to start again. As a 25 year local, this has been one of our \"go to\" buffets. The price is right and it is close to my home.  My last review complained about the quality of the food and some management decisions.  In the last couple of months the quality and variety of food has improved greatly.  We are brunch on the weekend and lunch during the week, seldom dinner guests.  The carving station offerings are always very good, and recently, turkey, ham AND pork loin have been available.  Liver and onions are back (always very well prepared) and even meat loaf has reappeared occasionally.  I feel it important that I update my previous review to say that I recognize the improvements.   I still question buffet management's decision to upset most employees schedules.  NO ONE, not the employees, not the quests like the changes. We are adjusting our schedules to accommodate your changes because we value our time with our favorite servers and food handlers. Bottom line... good food, really good prices, and great service."}
{"text":"Wow. Daniel S's review pretty much covers what they serve. Bravo Daniel!   Now for my opinion. At the time of this review, Festival was having a special. 3.99 for breakfast, 4.99 for lunch, and 5.99 for dinner (with a player card which is free to sign up). Of course it's for a limited time only, so take full advantage before it goes back up to another 3 dollars respectively, at least you could have said you tried it and didnt have to spend much money. Trust me, I have eaten here even before this special and their food has not changed except for major holidays but of course you have to spend extra.  Most people ask what is Festival Buffet comparable to? Well, the first obvious answer is that compared to the highly priced buffets off the strip, that is a big \"negative\". If you ever heard of Home Town Buffet, which you should unless you have been hiding in a bomb shelter for the last 20 years, that is the closest I can compare it to. I would say Festival is just a little bit better, mainly because of the \"Mongolian Cooking\" option. That alone right there is worth the price because of the cooked to order theme.  So for a decent but not great food for the price, I would come back occasionally, especially if I have family and friends looking to save some money."}
{"text":"Wretched - recommended only for those waxing nostalgic over the slop served up in boot camp. Note that there are several mess halls in the military that serve better food than is served here.  We had the brunch buffet. Little breakfast selection, but plenty of nachos, pasta and tacos. Just what you would want at 8 in the morning, right?   Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a couple times now. Everything we went the employees were very nice and the food was good. We will be coming back and telling others about it."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all of the time and really liked it. However, the past 3 or 4 times that I ate it I became very ill. I can eat just about anything so this is significant. 0 stars"}
{"text":"Still the best place in Henderson. What more can you want for a true $5 Vegas buffet?"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to sample the Festival Buffet for a business luncheon today and was disappointed on several points.  There is no breakfast, so that mean..... no eggs, egg white, egg substitutes; just Denny's meh The Stir fry station had what looked to be the only edible veggies there, however, they stir fry them in so much oil its ridiculous The service was slow and not the quality of other Station locations, especially inside their famous \"Feast buffets\"  Overall, I thought it was pretty bad and don't plan on a future visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"A hop, Skip, and jump away from my stomping grounds is this pretty decent buffet off the 95 on Lake Mead parkway inside of the Fiesta Henderson.    The Festival buffett won''t win any best of Las Vegas awards, and It's not the greatest or biggest buffet in Henderson, but probably the best value because their Mongolian grille, and a pretty good offering of vegetables at that station.   Like most Station Casino buffets, it has the standard offering of American, Italian, Mexican, BBQ, and a small seafood area, but this place is about the Mongolian BBQ, and fried Chicken.  Yeah, the Fried Chicken is actually very good ..don't worry Chef Keller, this place has nothing on yours but for 5.99 at lunch, this place kills it!    The wait help can be a hit or a miss, but If I go with my mom, who's has a chairman status players card with them, everything is good.  Even though they might have a huge line when they do their promo, we will walk right in and get our butt kissed, then given their most experienced staff member who's pretty much on it.  I guess having a higher membership status has it privileges.  On the other hand, if I take one of my friends there with my card, I have stand with the rest of the cattle in the general line. Perhaps, I better start carrying a walking cane, because there so many bogus people without a disability who are cutting into  the handicap line. Sorry, but being mentally challenged because you can't read isn't a handicap. Come on Station Casino please enforce this."}
{"text":"All i can say is Fiesta must of heard the reviews! 4 stars cause this place is in the ghetto. But this is for sure the best option on this side of town. Dare i say impressed. Its clean, food is fresh, and tasty! I cant believe this is the same place i used to come too."}
{"text":"Eh. Definitely not the worst buffet that I have been to, but not the best either as there could be more options to chose from."}
{"text":"They offer no locals or veteran discount. If you get one of their club cards, Dinner will be $9.99 instead of $13.99. Food was average and not really worth $9.99.  Wait staff was very slow. Don't expect a drink refill soon. Unless your starving and not really thirsty you may want to find somewhere else.  UPDATE. Festival Buffet Does offer a local and or Veterans discount. It appears the employee we asked was to stupid to know their policy. If you want a good buffet go to Green Valley Ranch Casino"}
{"text":"Thought we would try out The Festival Buffet   At the Fiesta Casino for the Champagne Brunch .   It wasn't that busy, we were kind of surprised. The waitress from our section never came to our table. A different lady saw us waiting to place our drink orders before we got our food and asked us what we would like to drink. When she got our drinks she returned back to her section.( to bad I didn't get her name)   We were very disappointed by the lack of attention our waitress had for her section. We never got her name cause she never came to our table except to pick up to pick up dishes. Plus When we were done with our drinks she didn't even come up and ask us if we wanted refills.   The buffet was small with not that many seafood options for a brunch, the omelette bar was very good the best part of the buffet by far . The waffles got cold and rubbery by the time we got to our table.   They also had a Mongolian BBQ station which was another great feature but they don't put enough shrimp so I asked for extra shrimp. Still didn't get enough shrimp for my liking.   Two stars out of five. It was not worth our time !"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving this buffet five stars is that,even though it isn't a top notch gourmet restaurant or one of the more upscale buffets in Las Vegas,the food items they did have were very tasty and enjoyable for me and it is a very fair price with lunch priced at $6.99.You are definitely getting value for your money here.I've come here a couple of times in the last few months for lunch and I really liked it.The items here aren't necessarily the fanciest food but what they did have tasted good and you didn't have to take out a second mortgage on your home to be able to afford this place.I've been to much more expensive restaurants where I didn't enjoy my meal a fraction of what I did here.The salad bar was good,the main items were good,the desserts were good and the servers were good.I have nothing bad to say about this place.Try it.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"went for Hawaiian night.  for $13, it wasn't too bad.  I wasn't expecting much, and it is a good thing I wasn't.  for the highlights, spam fried rice was really tasty.  the chicken long rice wasn't too shabby.  the roast pig was a big disappointment.  the poke was good.  I definitely got my money's worth in poke alone.  kalua cabbage and huli huli chicken were on the ok side.  the won tons in the won ton soup were actaully quite good.  if fiesta rancho wasn't so far away i would go again.  but it is pretty far from me.  but the $13 price is worth it for the poke alone."}
{"text":"I was in the area with a friend on a Sunday around 10 in the morning and we decided to give this place a try since they offered an all you can drink champagne brunch buffet at that time and we were starving. We usually love to do champagne brunch and take advantage of the food and drinks as much as we can.  Let's start with the positive. Parking is easy, and this place is very easy to access with 215 or 515. It also very cheap, $9.99 with the rewards card for all you can eat and all you can drink champagne. At least we thought so... Because that's where things started to get sour...  We took a few plates of food since we like to try pretty much everything at a buffet. Unfortunately, the food was only mediocre at best... The only positive about the food is that the selection is reasonably large.  We also took a few glasses of champagne like we always do at a buffet. Unfortunately, after our 3rd glass, our waitress informed us that there was a 3-glass limit and that she could not give us more alcohol. I asked other people as well as the manager, and everyone assured me that there was no such limit. We went to see the waitress with the manager and we were offered another round of champagne but we were told that we shouldn't take any more food...  We asked for an additional round after that but our waitress just refused to serve us that time. I then asked the manager to sit us at another table since I thought our waitress was the problem, but the manager then told me that they would not serve us champagne anymore because we drank too much (after 4 not even full champagne flutes...).   What's the point of offering all you can drink if you limit your customers to 3 small glasses of champagne only? Such limits should be clearly stated at the entrance AND at the time of payment. After several minutes of arguing with the manager, she finally offered to refund us for the total price of the two buffets which was the only positive gesture. Restaurants should not judge their customers! A place to avoid absolutely!"}
{"text":"These lovely people accommodated our large group with care. They were so pleasant and made us feel very special and welcome. They set us up in a private room and had some wonderful staff taking care of us who treated us like family. Everyone we interacted with was so nice and the food was a great value for the price. Would book again!"}
{"text":"Never really had crunchy biscuits with gravy till I ate it here.  The apple juice was a bit watered down.  My wife had the collard green and it was bitter.  Had pork loin cut for me and it was good."}
{"text":"I got there a few minutes before 11 am opening time for serving lunch. The price with a Rewards card is only $6.99. The Mongolian station is worth it alone. I had the beef with noodles and veggies. I saw a couple with a 2 for 1 coupon. What a deal. The food was fresh and they have sugar free desserts that's why I live the place. The ice tea kept coming. The server was attentive and it's well run. Not overly packed but it was early for lunch. I've never been disappointed in this reasonably priced buffet."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this buffet for the value. If you want an amazing buffet with Instagram worthy food look elsewhere because this ain't it. If you want a cheap buffet with decent food, a hot station or two, and minimal line then this is right for you. And if you have a coupon? Even better! (Tip: If you play here even a tiny bit they will send you a BOGO coupon)  They have a nice variety of food, a decent salad bar, and ample seating. If you want some quick eats for a good price this is a great option. If you're a picky eater then I recommend surveying the buffet beforehand. For what it's worth my husband is NOT a fan of this buffet."}
{"text":"it had been many years since even stepping foot inside the fiesta henderson, but we got some 2-for-1 buffet coupons and we LOVE salad bars... so figured, why not??   the buffet is upstairs and we had a short wait in line, no biggie. hostesses were pleasant and sat us quickly.  sald bar was not as big as at other buffets or restaurants, but it was clean and items were fresh...   cooks were friendly and our server was really attentive and on top of everything eventho she had a big section and was busy...   we left there happy and full and only spending like $15 (including tip)!!!"}
{"text":"Two stories = Five Stars  Here is the first story:  We arrived, my wife, soon to be ten year old daughter and myself were standing in like and talking about said birthday. There was an older lady in front of us and she had in her hand one of those gaming cards you can get at casino, use it when gambling and earn points that you can use towards the casino's buffets among other options. Anyway the older lady saw us, heard us talking about the pending birthday and offered to buy us lunch, using her players card. \"Consider it an early birthday present!\" she said.  WOW ! My wife was in tears by the generous offer.  Here is the second story:  I love this buffet simply for it's Mongolian Barbecue station. My nine year old daughter has never tried this kind of barbecue, and followed me to try some for herself. If nothing else she wanted some free chop sticks. But here is the conversation we had...  Father: First put some of these noodles on your plate. (she did) Father: Would you like and of these with it? (pointing at onions, green peppers and such) Daughter: Nope Father: Roasted Vegetable? Daughter: Nope Father: What about the toppings on that side of the counter? Daughter: Nope Father: Okay, would you like beef? Daughter: Nope Father: Chicken, you said you wanted chicken earlier. Maybe some pork? Daughter: Nope Father: What about sauces? Want some teriyaki or soy sauces? Daughter: Nope Father: You just want the noodles? My Daughter at this point smiles and looks at the cook, and gives him a dollar I handed her to give to him as a tip.  I let her be as she waited for the noodles and helped myself to the Mexican food station just a few yards away. I got back to our table before she did. When my daughter returned a few moments later, she had something on top her noodles.  Father: What did you put on your noodles? Daughter: Orange chicken dad... DUH ! (Insert blank face with blinking eyes here)  Food is satisfactory at best, but for Las Vegas casinos, that's what I expect. Service was better today that at most Buffets. Usually you have to wait to get a refill on drinks, plates to be cleared from your table, etc. Not today.  Great day to choose eating at Fiesta Rancho's Festival Buffet."}
{"text":"This is a buffet??? We were in the area and decided to try the festival buffet because my mother was craving Mongolian and they had it as part of the buffet. We showed up at brunch time and there were no options to choose from. My mom wouldn't try the Mongolian section because it looked gross. I am disappointed in this buffet and I will not return here ever again"}
{"text":"This is another good cheap Las Vegas Buffet.  Taco's are pretty good, the fish is pretty bad.  They also ran out of bean sprouts for the Mongolian Grille.  Regardless, I will go back many many more times.  Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I've had better. Service was good but I waited a long time for refills."}
{"text":"Gross. Just gross.  I was hoping that maybe this one was different than the sunset station down the street, maybe a couple of different items but I was wrong. Still the same old crap. I don't know why people pay so much money for these buffets, I would rather pay a little more and go somewhere that is actually going to be good.   Over processed, frozen, nasty. Save your money."}
{"text":"Just left.   We had four people.  One was a two year old.  Anyways they didn't tell me they charge for a 2 year old to go in.  Fine I understand that but tell me your charging me for two.  Give me the opportunity to say nevermind I don't want to eat here.  She eats like a bird. Literally a bite of corn on Cobb and a ice cream cone.    The lady swiped my card without telling me what she was charging me for.   When I noticed the price on register and asked for a refund takes 3-4 days.   I could of got a subway sandwich instead for myself and my two year old for under 10 dollars.   I'm upset because she didn't tell me what I was paying before she charged my card.   The manager was standing right there.  Heavyset guy and didn't say squat.   He could of cared less.    The waitress was great.     The manager did nothing to make us happy. My daughter also fell backwards on the tile right in front of him and he didn't even ask if she was ok?   Don't u make an incident report if someone falls backwards on a chair and hits the tile?  We won't be back.    Probably the worst buffet out there"}
{"text":"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.  Service from the servers was good, but not from the staff at the food stations.  I remember asking for turkey, guy cut a slice and immediately left.  He didn't even give me a chance to ask for an extra cut.  I asked someone else and he cut me a piece, but obviously wasn't happy that he had to actually work.  Rest of the food was sparce.  You would think that items like fish, chicken, and mash potatoes would be readily available.  Not the best food experience, so I gave dessert a try.  Not much of a selection either.  Next time I'm in the area and in the mood for a casino buffet, I will just drive the extra 4 miles and go to GVR.    I rate a buffet based on lines, selection, taste, and service.  This place only managed to hit one of the four.  Yes...line was quick."}
{"text":"The Festival Buffet is a rather basic buffet, but isn't that what one should expect from a rather basic casino? Besides, it's only $6.99 for dinner Monday-Saturday (excluding holidays) if you have the Amigo Card!    On my last visit I didn't see anything exceptional, you aren't going to find rack of lamb or caviar here... They did have a prime rib and roast turkey station, and the turkey was surprisingly moist and tasty for a cheap buffet. There is a Mongolian grill, Italian, Mexican, and BBQ sections as well, plus a small salad bar. And the deserts, albeit simple ones, never disappoint.   Brunch on Sundays will run you a little more money ($13.99 with the card), but does include champagne. They serve crab legs then as well.  Diners have the option of purchasing alcohol during other times, my husband and I split a bottle of pinot grigio that cost us $7.99. The waiter that brought out our wine was friendly and seemed happy to serve us, he came back by later to make sure we were happy with the wine as well.   If you are looking for an affordable buffet option in the Henderson area, Festival Buffet is A-OK."}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas, so it goes without saying that I am a big buffet fan. I love buffets so much that it's amazing that I don't weigh 450 pounds. I guess if I had to eat at this buffet, I'd lose weight. It's sort of like a bad cruise ship buffet. Nothing looks too appetizing and nothing tastes too good. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and they all have the same carb-laden, cheap foods (think industrial packaged breads, canned corn, mashed potatoes). The food is simple and not too spicy or salty. It's fine if you need to eat, but don't make a special trip to go here. The lines and lines of old folks out front used to amaze me until I realized they are only eating here because they have a free coupon. Even for free, I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since we have been here. I think this was our last.   We had a coupon for buy one get one half off with your Boarding Pass Rewards card. We decided to go early Sunday morning.  The line was short, and we were sat immediately. Our waiter was very nice and brought drinks to our table quickly.   There were many options, even around 9:30am. Breakfast items such as eggs, bacon (crispy! Yay!), waffles, french toast; Asian lunch items, Mexican fare, roast beef and salad bar. There were plenty of desserts as well, including pie, cakes, cookies and ice cream.   There were a few things that were very good. The roast beef and bacon stood out as great. The salad dressings at the salad bar though, they were the most tasteless that I think I have ever had. I love salad bars, and this one was not good at all. Well, it would have been fairly decent had they used better dressings. Ones with an actual flavor.   Eating is too much fun to waste it on bland and boring food."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible, rude manager and  Terrible customer service from her employees. All I did was ask a question about when they open and the cashier wouldn't even look at me and answer my question. I let her know that she was very rude. After getting back in line I could hear her and the manager talking about me like a couple of children. Grow up bullies. Never again and I will bad mouth Fiesta Buffett every chance I get to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I don't know how this buffet does not have 5 stars. It's my go to buffet. The service and great and the price is even greater. You'd think you are getting lousy quality food for the price you are paying, but don't be fooled. The food is always fresh and there is never a time when a tray is empty. I've gone for brunch and dinner many times and today, I went for the Valentine's brunch. It was $9.49 and included champaign as well. There is also an omelet station and a Mongolian station. You can't ask for more and you can't go wrong with this buffet."}
{"text":"This buffet is cheap and nice. A lot of choices for salads with the salad bar but the other food is average... (inedible pizza, baked potatoes cold, fish was dried...) Choice for dessert was ok but I didn't find bread pudding so disappointed :-/"}
{"text":"Located in The Fiesta Hotel Casino in Henderson. Ok so its not the most lavish buffet. Ok so its not even the best mediocre buffet. But hey it's edible. The price is right, under $5 for breakfast with your Stations Casinos Boarding Pass Card. The selection was not bad. All in all I wouldn't make a special trip out there, but if you are in the neighborhood, give it a whirl. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"@stationcasinos N Rancho #Vegas #Easter Buffet $13.00 per person.  Most of my experience at any Stations Casino Buffet have been less than stellar BUT  I'm a sucker for CHEAP and I keep going back.  Just now I have Lowered Expectations...always hoping at least dessert can save the day if the rest of the buffet is as expected.  Easter dinner offered Lamb Chops,Turkey,Ham and Crab Legs..sounds good right?? Nope still a Stations Casino Buffet.  The only way you can get them to change something out is to take it all put it on your plate yourself and throw it away. They had the same 6 lamb chops looking all pathetic the whole time I was there. The crab legs were COLD and they said they would heat them up-too many or too much something. They did offer made-to-order mongolian food whatever that is BUT the pasta,pizza,mexican,chinese and american was pathetic as usual-all dried up and unappealing-twice I walked the whole thing and NEVER put anything on my plate. This time EVEN the desserts didn't do the trick. The bread pudding was ok but the cheesecakes were dry and the other stuff that looked good was SUGAR-FREE--yuck!!!  I never learn!!! :("}
{"text":"First to Review?  I wish someone would have taken the time to save me the trouble..  Very small selection, lackluster at best. The fried chicken looked yellow?WTF!  They have seafood,BBQ,Mongolian,Chinese,Mexicano,American,Italian and a 6 item salad bar.plus a dessert station.  The big attraction is the Mongolian which is made to order-NOT for me.  I tried a little of everything and was pretty disappointed but I filled up on eclairs & cheesecake.  It beat having to stand in line 2 hrs @ Green Valley Ranch but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"if I could give minus stars I would. Just came in for dinner to try it out and I'll never be back. Most of the food looked like it sat under the heat lamps since lunch. everything was so dry. The salad and catfish was ok but rice pilaf was nothing short of little bricks. So I went for the pasta to and Alfredo sauce. the Alfredo sauce was good but the pasta was gummy as it was over cooked! It's obvious the chef at this buffet can care less what his/her line cooks put out as the food quality is NOTHING like the other Station casino buffets. save your money and go to taco bell! this was by far the worst food I've ever had... this place should be shut down! buyer beware!!!"}
{"text":"For just $9.99 for Sunday Brunch. Best deal in town. Champagne is included. How can you beat that. I don't know why the other reviews are so bad. I eat here every Sunday. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great deal.  Approximately $9 dinner for dinner on a Saturday night. Approximately $9 everyday, except major holidays.   There are eight stations. Here are the stations with a sample of their food.    1. International        craw fish        fish        rice pilaf   2. Chinese,         chow mein        fried rice        egg rolls        hot and sour soup   3) Barbecue        live station serving roast beef and turkey.       baked potatoes   4)Bakery,    5)Mongolian,    6)Mexican       nachos        Spanish rice       Southwestern corn   7)American,         burgers   8) Italian         pizza (I pass over buffet pizza)         Spaghetti with choice of sauces   Plus two salad bars, with one of them serving soup.    I have dined at the Festival Buffet a few times. They were no bad experiences with the food. The exception is that the egg flower soup was kind of cold.   This ain't no Carnival Buffet. If you expect shrimp or crab legs, you will be disappointed. For the price, Festival Buffet is no 1 star buffet.   Return factor: high"}
{"text":"The place was fair for the price, but I would have preferred better food with a slightly higher price.   The first place I tried mostly italian foods. The alfredo sauce looked gross in that pot, but it was okay when I ate it. It looked like jelly. I thought, well I will enjoy this. Then I started looking at the selection and eating it, and my taste buds were not digging anything. Some of the things were stale or old tasting, like they'd been sitting there for awhile. I didn't try any of the chinese food because I had eaten some recently, but it looked unappetizing. It was tolerable.  The only plus was that the waitresses were fast to serve you drinks and remove your plates. She would check back pretty often."}
{"text":"As locals we get two for one coupons occasionally. We love using them at Sunset Station and GVR but we won't go back to the Fiesta Buffet even with a twofer coupon. There is a limited number of items and the flavor is bland. The Mongolian grill is good and that is the only thing redeeming about this place. It you are stuck at the Fiesta, go to the Mexican restaurant which is pretty good. Avoid the buffet at all costs."}
{"text":"This place has better selections than Sunset Station Fiesta ( even Green Valley feast). WHAT IT DESPERATELY NEEDS IS AN UPGRADE ON APPEARANCE - A LONG OVERUE, I SAY. I like their Mongolian station with the schezwan sauce. Btw, please bring back that deep fried white fish with schezwan sauce and spinach - my all time favorite. Overall, South Point buffet is still the best local buffet, followed by Red Rock."}
{"text":"Yup, there really is nothing good to write about this place. I went because I thought it was Kalua pig night only. I am not even sure what I ate. It's pretty greasy and oily here."}
{"text":"Went on 9/2 Sometimes you need a buffet. Get the casino card and you will get in for under $10 So what can you expect for $10? You want gourmet go to ceasar's and pay $60 a plate, of course I am assuming since I am not paying that for a buffet.  The food was decent, I ate a lot of vegetables, some were prepared with way too much salt, which is standard.  A lot of variety, if you didn't like that nationality just move on to the next.  They have a mongolian grill, I was there very late so I assumed it was being cleaned and closed but someone else went and ordered.  The meats were not nasty and dried out, the pastas in the Italian section were.  It was a better decision over going to a fast food joint which would probably have cost about the same.  Waitress was very attentive, kept the plates off the table and water in the glass."}
{"text":"Value - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Food - 2.5/5 Atmosphere - 2/5  Overall this is some of the best value I have ever seen if you have the discount. Food is reasonable. Very friendly and prompt service. Recommended if you're looking for good value.   Gumbo - 2.5/5 Mac and Cheese - 1.5/5 Biscuit - 3/5 Sausage Gravy - 4/5 Chow Mein - 2.5/5  Tofu - 3/5 Sometimes the tofu is spicy, other times it is sweet. Spicy version 3.5/5, sweet version 3/5. Both are good."}
{"text":"First time at the fiesta buffet. I was there for brunch at about 12 PM. There wasn't that many people, therefore there was a lot of seating area.  So let's get right into the food. I have to say that the food there was average at best. The only thing that stood out to me as above average was the mashed potatoes and the carved Turkey.  I had a slice of pizza, all I have to say is yikes! It was not good. It tasted like frozen pizza  that you find at Smith's freezers.  I also had wonton soup, it was so bad I couldn't finish it. How can you mess up wonton soup?  I do have to say one thing though, if I go back it isn't because of their food but because of the excellent service they have there. The lady that brought me my drinks and took the plates back was exceptional with her service, her name is Irma, she greeted me with a smile kept my drinks coming and picked up my plates in a very timely manner.   So if there is anyone from management reading this post I would like you to know that the only reason I would go back there is because of the great service those employees working at the buffet gave me."}
{"text":"A very good Buffett that is organized according to type of food.  The ice cream is outstanding and the wait staff are fast in clearing tables.  The price is reasonable if you get the amigo card, but can be costly for groups with several children.  Very clean."}
{"text":"Hi. Couple months ago I went with my family to fiesta Henderson buffet but is not the same is reduced to almost nothing please bring back everything like it was when station casinos buy this property inside the buffet the rest is fine. Thank you."}
{"text":"The only thing I enjoyed was the Mongolian gril & my beer. I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm really in the for the Mongolian BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is good(don't forget to get a free players card to get discount)  The waiter here are slow, well ours was slow. Took her forever to bring drinks and to pick up our plates. Chinese section is ok just need more varieties of food. Bar-B-Q (no ribs!!) The mashed potatoes look un appetizing. Mongolian stand, the chef was sweet and explained the sauces and cooked my food to perfection. Mexican section  \"you call that mexica?\" Yuck! Italian section was okish, the pasta looked dry and the sauce had other foods in it. The fried chicken was good and juicy and the coleslaw was also good. The mac n chesse tasted disgusting tried putting salt in pepper but it didn't help at all.  Bakey had good variety of pies and they had no sugar deserts also...and ICE CREAM!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor food selections and incomplete food pairings. Arranged weird. Food bland and flavorless. Now I know why there is hardly ever a line. Someone in management here needs guidance."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this wasnt a terrible experience! Ive definitely been to worse buffets (Im looking at you Sunset Station!) Line to get in was slow slow slow so be prepared. Came in for a Sunday Brunch. Salad bar (while the set up is super strange) had plenty of fresh options so I was immediately a happy camper. Breakfast items like pancakes, french toast, waffles, and eggs were tasty. They had bacon, sausage etc but I was going veggie only on todays trip. For the rest of it, I was also pretty happy. Tofu over in the Chinese section was deeelicious. They had lots of different grilled veggies (available by the carved meats) that were surprisingly hot and really good. Oooh those mashed potatoes....yum. Dessert section wasnt bad but Main Street has much better options. The server was quick, friendly and took good care of his section even though he had some really large tables to watch over."}
{"text":"Typical Vegas buffet. Not great, not bad. Typical fare. Pretty decent selection of items and a good Mongolian BBQ keeps this above a 2 star."}
{"text":"For the price, it's fair. Service was good at the table, selection was more than adequate. Quality of food isn't that great, but that comes with the price.   I'm also a big fan of Mongolian, and they made it their centerpiece, right in the middle of the buffet. Then, for some reason, they hired an employee we'll call \"V\", mostly because that was the first letter in her name. V  apparently hates her job, hates customers, and hates Mongolia. She seasoned the food with bitterness and hate, and I'm only half surprised she didn't throw my plate at me when she was done.  I was kinda glad it wasn't very good, because I would have dreaded the prospect of interacting with her again.   In summary, the buffet is nothing special, but the price is right.    And avoid the Mongolian if you see someone who looks like they would gut you for asking what sauces were available."}
{"text":"I measure by three different things in comparison to Taco Bell:  DECOR: This buffet is located inside the Fiesta Hotel & Casino. Therefore expect a huge sitting area, tacky carpet patterns, and lots of food stations. Nothing special. Taco Bell is way fancier.   SERVICE:  Well this is a buffet, so you get your own food. The beverages came consistently though.  FOOD: I tried a little bit from every station: The Prime rib, some sausages, one single crawfish, some of the chinese food station, and a cookie. The food was just bleh. Probably the worst Casino Buffet I've ever been. Do not recommend. Much rather chow down on lots of Taco Bell items for the similar prices.   FINAL VERDICT: Is Taco Bell better? GOD YES..  In short: I got food poisoning from this place. I've never ever ever gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell. Enough said."}
{"text":"We have lived in Las Vegas for 15 years, and we have eaten at every buffet here. The Festival Buffet was OK five years ago, but now it is the worst ever, worse than the old Sahara or Surf Buffets. My 'Mongolian' grill was a tasteless and congealed mess. I had 'stromboli' which was full of cheese and RAW white onions. My fried chicken, cheese enchiladas, and roast beef were dry and tasteless, and dessert was dry cookies and cake. Oh, and the table next to ours had two small children who went berserk for a half hour and the staff did nothing about it. FUN!"}
{"text":"First off, I am not a fan of buffets. I don't visit them. So I have very little to compare to.  I took my work crew here because its 1) close and 2) cheap. At $9 per person they can get their grub on (which they did) and enjoy a nice variety of foods from Chinese to Mexican to American to Italian. None of it is high quality. The pork loin was good, but you won't order that at Michael Mina's and be impressed. Even with the turkey gravy on it.   What I did enjoy was the service. From the front cashier to our table waitress, everyone was super nice and did a great job. Even the grumpy carving guy, after being asked \"no turkey\" for the 20th time could manage a smile and laugh at my follow up joke \"No turkey for you\" .   I do this crew buffet meal once a year, to show my appreciation for all their hard work. Normally I BBQ ribs, chicken, steak, carne asada, stuffed burgers and other meals throughout the year. The one advantage to going to the Fiesta is after lunch I can treat them to a shot and a beer, which I'm not allowed to do on property (thanks stupid lawyers)."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas talking about how much better the buffets are here than where we live in laughlin nevase. My mistake ! This place is terrible. Very disappointed food old, dried out, nasty. Will never eat here again. The rest of the restaurants here are great.  But this buffet is the Pitts. Don't do it. There is better food right outside the door."}
{"text":"Review is for Hawaiian Night Tuesdays.  This buffet really lives up to its 2 stars - I walked in with low expectations, but figured that it's kind of hard to screw up Hawaiian buffet food, so how bad could it be? The answer is pretty effing bad.    I was lured in with promises of laulau, kalbi and lechon (crispy whole roast pig) - all lies. No laulau or kalbi, and their lechon was tasteless with rock hard skin not crispy. Some other reviews complained about the poke servings being small, but who cares - it's ayce and these were big chunks of decent quality fish. That, the fried rice and the chicken long rice were the only positives I found - they managed to eff up everything else there. Even desserts were bad - I've never seen bread pudding that looked like that, hard stale malasadas, pasty haupia w big chunky gobs of cornstarch in it. I felt guilty with how much food I threw away.  Even at only $13 I felt ripped off with how awful the food was. If you have to do a Hawaiian buffet, do Silverton's for $20 instead. I also heard that Silver Sevens (ex Terribles) has a Hawaiian night coming up with a loco moco bar! So fingers crossed that doesn't suck balls too."}
{"text":"If this buffet wasn't $4, I would have asked for my money back. NOTHING is made here. It is all frozen goods that get toasted ,baked, reheated and so on. The only redeeming thing is the live egg station where you can have eggs and omelets cooked to order... otherwise I would have gotten stuck with liquid eggs and GAS all the way home to Denver on the 12 hour car ride."}
{"text":"* Stir fry station * Drive-up betting * Billed as \"The Ultimate Buffet Adventure\" * $9 lunch (save $1 with your Amigo Club card) * No breakfast, but you can go to Denny's in-house  Located in the dingy and cheerless Fiesta Rancho, a Station Casinos property.  Judging by the appearance of the Fiesta, Station has a bifurcated strategy--keep the high-end properties in tip-top shape while letting the 2nd-tier joints lapse into disrepair.  The Fiesta is only about ten years old but looks 25. It's in an unappealing part of town.  The only reason to go is to redeem a 2-for-1 buffet coupon.  I wasn't crazy about the Rampart Buffet, but I liked it better than the Fiesta. The first thing you notice is holiday stun tunes blaring over loud speakers.  Forget about having a civilized conversation trying to shout over the music.   The serving stations are Italian, American, Mexican, and \"Mongolian.\" The best feature is the stir-fry station where you select your veggies and the guy fries 'em up.  He'll toss in various meats and sauces. Some diners leave a $1 tip.    I couldn't finish my helping of dry, tasteless, stringy chow mien noodles.  The meat loaf was bad.  The pork egg rolls were dry and tasteless. The American section had small, shriveled filets of a nameless fish (tilapia I was later told).  The Mexican station has a do-it-yourself taco bar. There's really nothing to like about this buffet. I would never pay full price here.  At 2-for-1 it's barely worth it. I gave it three stars, however, to compensate for my anti-buffet bias.  A server told me a lot of neighborhood regulars come here, but attendance has trailed off since the economy went into a tailspin."}
{"text":"This buffet isn't meant to be 5 stars food and quality wise. I would say it would be a 3. Each restaurant should aim to want a five star recognition but what can you do? It's just a small, local buffet. Every item was either a hit or mess. You can never go wrong with salad, fruit, and the breakfast options. Their omelette station was better than the eggs Benedict. I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail and egg drop soup. They have all different types of food, so try them all.   I still gave them 4 stars because it's cheap and the service was actually great. I kept trying to get a hold of my waitress' name but she walked so fast you couldn't even catch it. She was here and there very quickly. We were a huge party of 25 for Sunday breakfast and there were other parties there and she still was very attentive to us. I'm shocked at how great her service was, I would give her 6 stars. She had an accent and red hair with flowers in it. She was super sweet and adorable, and this review is mainly for her and how amazing she did. I hope that other servers are just as great as she is."}
{"text":"Because the price for dinner is $5.99, a lot of low income people come here daily. But, on the other side of the spectrum, you get a lot of stereotypical suburban middle-class families(you know, the ones with the 9-5 jobs, 2 children and a dog) eat here to save money.  They allow homeless people to eat here.   Today, there was a homeless man eating here. He brought his giant bag full of empty soda cans, clothes, and all types of items he had collected in his life.  For the next 40 minutes we had to hear him scream, talk to himself loudly, make loud choking/coughing noises, and to make things worse he constantly kept banging the table with both his fists for no apparent reason. These episodes of punching the table went on for about 30 seconds at a time, and could be heard from outside the restaurant.  The server just decided to abandon the area. He knew that everyone sitting in the 4 tables surrounding the homeless man was gonna be pissed. He accepted the fact that he was not gonna get a tip from any of those guests, and made a decision to not service any of us.   This isn't the worst experience I've had with a host sitting me next to inappropriate people. When I was at the Flamingo in Laughlin, the idiot host sat me next to a group of 6 guys with swastikas tattooed on their foreheads.  I'm actually shocked that the bum didn't ask anyone for spare change when waiting in line at the Mongolian BBQ area. I'm gonna give this place an extra star for actually serving Turkey at the carving station instead of possum. I'm also gonna give this place another star for making sure there wasn't a severed toe in the bread pudding."}
{"text":"For someone who doesn't like buffets, I end up eating at a lot of buffets. We met here to try the Hawaiian buffet items that they carry on Tuesdays. The price is $12.99 with a player's card.   The only things I would be interested in eating again were the roast pig and bbq pork. The rest of the food didn't do much for me. Most of the main dishes and sides I tried were over salted and the dessert options were just sad. The only thing I liked from the desserts were the little cream puffs that you can buy at the grocery store.   Service was sufficient, but there were times that dirty plates and empty drink glasses sat a little longer than I would have liked. The sodas on the second round of drinks were all flat, so no one drank them and it was hard to find our server again to get them replaced.   They have singers and a hula dancer that come around to entertain everyone on Tuesdays. It was pleasant, but I would have preferred they stuck to one corner of the buffet instead of moving around to each table, since we had to awkwardly sit through their set, afraid to be rude and walk up to get more food while they performed.   I heard other patrons complaining about the price since it was a special menu that they weren't anticipating.   They did have a good amount of Hawaiian items to choose from, if you're interested in checking it out and the price seems about right for it. Just make sure you sign up for their player's card to receive the discount, since it's about four dollars more if you don't have one. One player's card will get you the discount for up to two diners."}
