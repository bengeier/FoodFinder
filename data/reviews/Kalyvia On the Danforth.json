{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated 4 stars.  Three of people in our party ordered the super combo and no one decided to tell us that they ran out of swordfish they plated and served us the dish anyways.  Everything was over cooked.  The only thing this place has going for it is the bread."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR my favourite restaurant on the Danforth.  Their food is always so fresh and full of lemon and garlic, just like Greek food should be.  The feta dip and the eggplant dip are my two favourite things in the world.  I order from them often - I would highly recommend you do as well!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years also.  But never done a review.   The best dish is getting the souvlaki with some of the house wine.  The tzatziki it comes with is meh.  Over all I would recommend this place for families with older children."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. I ordered the quail entree and my friend ordered the octopus. They come with salad, rice, roast potatoes and sauteed veges. All very good.  Also if you buy the entertainment book it's a buy one entree get one free so that's a big plus."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but too expensive for the amount of food I paid for. Clearly paying for the location in greektown more than the food itself.  Standard Greek dinner. Decent salad (too much lettuce), rice was fine, potatoes were really good, meat was fine, bread was good, and finally tzatziki was not bad but I have had better."}
{"text":"Took out of country guests and they loved everything they tried."}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery, and I don't understand why this place is rated 4 stars. It took them a little over an hour to deliver and the food was actually awful; dry and just too oily; the chicken looked and tasted like it was from the night before. Not going back here."}
{"text":"Kalyvia is my favourite place to dine on the Danforth! My experience has always been comfortable, fun, clean and yummy. The big menu, quality, and portion of the food are very exciting. If you love gyros that is leaner and not dripping of oil everywhere, this is the place for you!   I also love the staff there because they have such big bubbly personalities and care about giving you the best service possible. You can dine inside the restaurant which is very clean and has a beautiful cozy decor, or, you can dine on the patio and enjoy their delicious Greek dishes, all for reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I've gone three times on Friday nights with a group after doing some volunteer work nearby. And each time the people I'm with say \"it used to be much better\". Hint #1: all three times it's been empty at 9 pm on a Friday night. I've ordered the dolmades and they are good. And one of the other folks seems addicted to the saganaki. So, no complaints about the food. It's the service. I can ignore the stinkeye we get from the matronly woman who seems to be in charge of the front of the house. Note to her: when eight people walk into your empty restaurant a smile wouldn't hurt. We're not there to steal the silverware. What really mystifies me is the kitchen. I get that some of the things we order are appetizers and some are meals, but when each person orders one dish is it too much to ask that they all arrive on the same calendar day? All I can think of is that they are deliberately running the place into the ground so they have an excuse to sell the space to a developer."}
{"text":"Full disclosure - I'm a regular, and have been for about 3 years or so.  It's the best straight-up Greek the Danforth.  Simple and delicious.  No pretension.  Normally I have late-night takeaway, but when I've eaten in the service has been attentive but not overpowering.  Best order: gyro platter.  Food for a crowd and their gyro is juicy, flavourful, and comes with excellent salad and other fixings.  The dolma and spanakopita are all made in-house and remind me of my grandmother's recipes.  Their lamb chops by the piece can't be beat.  Do yourself a favour and order a bottle of old school Molson Dry with your gyro (an in-house thing) - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Danforth is the new Spadina. Eat here if you want bad service and want to feel like S#!t when you are done. At least on Spadina it is delicious after copious amounts of alcohol at 2am. Can't say the same for the carb ridden, salt laced, overpriced, options on Danforth. This place is no different. Sad looking greek salad with what resembles iceberg lettuce, is served by an older Greek man who could care less if you are there or not. Said man could easily have sold another few rounds of drinks but chose to stare at the ceiling opposed to paying attention to customers. I actually had to go up to him to order drinks to begin with! I seriously took about two bites of my meal and was done. Eatable and that's it. The Kids spaghetti was disgusting! How that could even be offered is truly astonishing. The whole Danforth experience really is baffling. Having been to Greece, I can tell you first hand that you would never find what Canadians call Greek food anywhere in Greece. The hotdog meat that we call Gyros, does not exist!  Although a true Greek Gyros experience can be found at Messini and a few other places in the city. This place does have it but it doesn't match up. If you are looking for the standard souvlaki, rice, potato, salad platter, save yourself about $12 and go to any mall food court. Same stuff. Less attitude. Well slightly less."}
{"text":"I must admit, I love Greek food.  It always hits the spot for me when I'm hungry.  As a visitor to Toronto I had to check out the Greek area on Danforth. After travelling through the congested streets of Bloor-Yorkville we finally got to Greektown.  This area certainly has a Greek flavor to it.  We were looking for a place that other yelpers had recommended, but I think they either changed their names or fell into a deep pita pocket.  We looked around at all the Greek restaurants but most were closed because it was the transition time between lunch and dinner ( it was 4:00 PM) We did stumble upon Kalyvia and were able to get take out.  We had the pork and chicken gyros in a pita wrap.  The meat was tender and the tzatziki was flavorful. All these goodies were wrapped up in a warm toasted pita shell.  This little hand held meal was my saviour on a hot Toronto day as I drove madly through the streets to my next destination, a blue jays game."}
{"text":"From a Greek...food was great and service was good! Love the Greek feel and music playing! Authentic pork or chicken just like in Greece! Calamari was AMAZING! In the heart of Greek town Toronto!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Kalyvia was a lovely one. Beautiful evening weather, seats at one of the three tables on their cozy patio, yummy food, lots of white wine and a waiter keen to please and entertain.  We arrived just as one of only three tables on the patio was leaving so managed to snag ourselves a seat at this prime real estate. It was perfect for watching the hustle and bustle of the Danforth rush by and soaking in the beautiful summer weather.  Upon our waiter's recommendation we went with (see pictures):  Spanakopita: Little triangle of spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo pastry. The phyllo was light flaky and delicious. I prefer mine with a little more filling but they were still definitely tasty.  The Pork Special: This was a huge portion, very tender and very tasty.   Chicken Souvlaki (the small size): One skewer of chicken, tzatziki, roasted potatoes, and rice. It was tasty, tender and flavourful without being greasy. No veggies served with this dish.  With every meal comes a complimentary salad which according to our waiter came complete with secret recipe house dressing (pretty tasty and they're definitely not skimpy with the feta cheese), and toasted house bread.  Beware the charismatic waiter. He's funny, keen to please, proud as can be of his little restaurant, and ... a bit of a hustler. I'm not entirely sure how it happened but we ended up with a second half litre of wine on our table without asking for it. Huh?  Anyway, stop into this place if you're on the Danforth. They make some great Greek food."}
{"text":"Grabbed their $4 pork souvlaki at Taste of the Danforth this year and the massive line up? Totally worth it.   Couldn't stop raving about the pita - it was so thoroughly heated through, soft, smokey, & yet just slightly crispy on the very outside. Super juicy pork, and lots of flavourful tzatziki to top kept me happy while I hunted down some more food.  Could've had a better balance on the onion to tomato ratio, but still, with quality like this for a busy street festival, I'm curious to see how the rest of their food is!"}
{"text":"As the waiting line  was so long at the Messini I decided to try my luck at Kalyvia based on Yelp reviews. I guess this restaurant could be good in other conditions. - Based on a tuesday night we were unlucky enough to have a table next to us with very noisy customers laughing off like they were alone in the restaurant. - The wait was quite long even if we were five to have ordered simple sandwiches. Almost 30 minutes to get served is a good reason to leave no tips. - One positive point in all that : the food was quite good, the meat was tasty and the french fries very good. - Note to the owners : try to give like detailed bills with the name of the dishes next to the prices, it will be much easier for the customers. -Finally : the staff is overwhelmed, you know what to do......"}
{"text":"Great greek restaurant! My girlfriend's family has been going there for close to 2 decades. The portions are quite large and their food is delicious. Their calamari is great! Saganaki is awesome. It's very casual and has a homey vibe. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place.  Why don't I?  They have a number of vegetarian meals which is great...except they aren't vegetarian.  The potatoes and rice are cooked in meat broth.  I asked if they had vegetarian potatoes and rice for the vegetarian meals and they said no, then told me I could get fries and mixed veggies instead.  That's all well and good but if it's advertised as a vegetarian meal and comes with potatoes and rice cooked in animal broth, it isn't vegetarian.  I've also had a couple of waiters say \"oh you're a STRICT vegetarian\".  No, I'm just a vegetarian!    This is false advertising and not only that, it's dangerous to a person that doesn't tolerate meat.  They need to be clear on their menus that none of their meals are vegetarian.  Having said all that, the Greek salad is my absolute favourite, the tyropita were fantastic, the various dips (tzatziki, hummus) are excellent.  The mixed veggies they serve as an alternative to potatoes/rice are not very good but the fries were terrific.    I will go back again but I'm not happy with them calling their food something it isn't."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, if only for the atmosphere and saganaki. Is it the best Greek food you can find on the Danforth? Probably not. Is it the cheapest? Absolutely not. Are the portions the size of your torso? Yes, which I personally view as a good thing.  While Kalyvia may not be perfect, they are consistent, and they do make a mean Greek salad so how much more can you ask for, really?"}
{"text":"We lived in Riverdale for seven years and tried every Greek restaurant on the Dannie in that time. The only one we return to after many years away is Kalyvia. Ambience may not be warm but i go for the food. Nobody does chicken Souvlaki like these guys. Or the lamb or the moussaka or even the Greek salads and tzatziki. Yummm. Need to return again soon..."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant to be one of the best on the Danforth.  The atmosphere is very pleasant and relaxing. I found the service to be excellent, and the waiter to have a good personality. Furthermore, the decor is also quite nice.  As far as the food is concerned, everything I had was really good, both in terms of quality and quantity. This place also has an excellent amount of choices on the menu. Moreover, their prices are also great compared to a lot of other Greek restaurants on the Danforth. Overall, Kalyvia is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm usually skeptical about Greek restaurants in Greektown just as much as I am skeptical about Italian restaurants in little Italy....just because they're in the area doesn't make them good.  I have been to Kalyvia several times because the food is actually pretty decent. The sizes aren't huge but the food tastes like it does in Greece. I would say Kalyvia is in my top two Greek restaurants on the Danforth, no. 1 being Pantheon.  The service is great, the staff is usually on the ball. The interior of the restaurant is okay, not very fancy looking. I would suggest sitting by the window, because you can at least see whatever is going on outside.  Anyways, I came here this past weekend for a friend's party. They were very friendly and able to accommodate 31 people on a Saturday night, so that was a bonus. I have to complain though about the HEAT. it was BOILING. I know the summer's over, but were they cheaping out on AC? I asked them to turn the AC up and the waiter said he did, however it did not get remotely comfortable until the end of the night, which was 4 hours later. The heat was distracting me from the actual food!  I had the tiropitakita, the cheese fillo pastry puffs and grilled calamari. They were delicious. I also had the small souvlaki dinner with rice and french fries, also good. We got a bottle of santorini white wine, which was okay, not the greatest white wine in the world...guess they're better at making ouzo;)"}
{"text":"Of late, I've coming here more frequently as I have found their food much better than the other places in Greektown. Their menu has a wide selection and I've found that my favourite grilled calamari is prepared significantly better than any of the other places around the area. Even something as simple as souvlaki, is done extremely well with portions that are very generous by my standards."}
{"text":"A lovely experience of casual dining and fabulous hospitality. Servers clearly enjoy the food they serve. Nice outdoor seating, and its location next door to a gelateria or ice cream shop of some sort makes it a nice spot to people-watch while you dine.  I was here for a late dinner on a Monday, and it was fairly slow, but I bet this place gets busy on the weekend.  I had a couple decent glasses of red wine, a not-so-decent spirit of some kind, good bread, a flamed (\"Opa!\") cheese appetizer, and the most delicious pork souvlaki. Spicy baklava and a coffee rounded out the night.  The server says it's the best salad on the Danforth, and the best dressing on the Danforth. Maybe so. It was good. I second the awesome reviews of the tzatziki. Delicious.  The bill (for one) with tip was $68, but that was four courses + 3 drinks. You could spend under $20 for a good meal (entree with salad and bread included)."}
{"text":"It was first visit. Before we came, we are walking around and desaided stop by Kalyvia. It was great choice. First of all few servers met us with smile and positive. When we got a table, our server Andre brought water immediately ( it was a big plus ) He was very polite and friendly. He told us about special of the day and took order for drinks.  For appetizers we decided to take 3 different dips. All of them was absolutely delicious. And more important thing - he brought warm bread and pita. I ordered Grilled Calmary, my husband - Pork Dinner. Portion is very big and delicious ( of course I asked take out box ) My friends also enjoyed a dinner.  Atmosphere is very cozy, but some decor and furniture look too old. But when I asked Andre about the place, he told me this restaurant is 26 years old!!!!!! I was surprised!!! Our bill was 50$ included tax ( 2 dinners, glass of wine, beer and appetizer ) Thank you very much guys!!! You are doing very good job!!! Definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"On y est allé sur les avis yelp! et car notre grec préféré était blindé, mais comme toujours ouvert à de nouvelles expériences nous y allons!  Le resto était aux 3/4 vides (comparé à celui d'en face où nous voulions manger) mais bon on y entre quand même!  Il n'y a pas photo la qualité est bien présente mais bon pas de frites avec le grec, il faut en payer à coté! donc en plus d'avoir attendu plus de 30 min alors que le resto était presque vide on a dû payer une addition de 15$ chacun, ce qui fout bien les boules pour ce qui n'est quand même qu'un grec!"}
{"text":"Mediocre, bland food. The people at the table beside us said the same thing about their meals, so I don't know if they were just having an off night or it is indicative of the food at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Like the first reviewer, this is only place I ever go on the Danforth AND I always order the lamb souvlaki.  Why wouldn't I? Where else can you get two skewers of tender lamb done the way you like it with delicious tzatziki on a nice warm pita.  The thing that puts it over the top is this drizzle of oily dressing they finish it off with. Makes it extra delicious.  If I can get someone to split a village salad (no lettuce) with me I'm happy."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Greek Restaurants on the Danforth.  Not because of the decor but because of the friendly staff and food.  They are very good at accommodating larger groups.  Village Salad and lamb souvlaki is primarily all I order, so can't comment on other menu items.  Good down home cooking."}
{"text":"First time coming here with a group of co-workers for lunch. This place strikes me as a casual and family-friendly restaurant . The owner was the only one available to seat the customers and serve the dishes, but there were only several tables full anyways. The owner was friendly, though you can tell he is very proud of his restaurant, and he must be as the food really stood out.  Ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner option (I know, I should have been more adventurous to try something different). Served with garlic bread, Greek salad, roasted potatoes and tzatziki. The Greek salad was outstanding and came in such a large portion. They certainly didn't hold back on the feta cheese and it complimented well with the dressing. Delicious. The entree itself was less inspiring though. Roasted potato tasted bland. The chicken souvalki was juicy and flavourful, but nothing special.   Though I do have to compliment the other dishes, as they all looked so much more appetizing than mine. The home-made gyros is a large portion and my co-worker couldn't get enough of it, quoting it to be one of the best she's ever had. The beef special came in a small stew pot, complimented with cheese and tomotoes. I watched as he wolfed it all down.   I would definitely come back and try something new next time. And it's right next to Dolce Gelato!"}
{"text":"I come to this page and am greeted by the suggestion to book a table...I think not!!!   Spent $40 on take out and my order is wrong and missing a main part of the meal. Not impressed, as this is the second time this has happened. They seal the take out bag like Fort Knox so there was no way to check without making my car smell like a kitchen. Not impressed and will only be returning for a refund of my meal. This is my second bad experience in as many weeks with take out on the Danforth. Having worked in the service industry for many years, I'm not a fan of folks not doing their jobs (kitchen to front of house). If you're 'above it all', find work elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here one night with a friend who lived in the area. Hadn't seen him in a while because I live in the States now so we decided to hit up some Greek food before getting downright drunk. Stopped off at a couple Greek restaurants in the area but were told that the wait would be at least 30 minutes so we put our names down but kept looking. Kalyvia seated us in 15 minutes so we stayed there even though they were completely packed. The lamb souvlaki is downright delicious. Have that with some pita bread and it is like taking a bit out of heaven. The lamb was very tender and not dry at all. At other Greek restaurants that I've eaten at, there's the chance that you'll end up getting a hard dry piece of meat that is just disgusting. Well. Not here my friend. There are plenty of good Greek restaurants in the area but Kalyvia is one of the better."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I've not be disappointed. Decent greek food at a really reasonable price. Their souvlaki is good and so is their saganaki (my fave greek food ever!). Its a nice restuarant overall, a good place to go to when you want to save some $ on the Danforth"}
{"text":"My favorite greek place on the Danforth! I love the gyros here for lunch, and the variety of dishes available for dinner makes it really hard to decide what to order! I've never been disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"For my first visit to Kalyvia, my BF and I went on my birthday. It was a Wednesday and very quiet. In fact, the place was 3/4 empty but I'm sure that on weekends it's packed.  First off, the decor. The place can definitely use a good sprucing up. When Ehsan F. wrote \"feels somewhat outdated and drab\", they were spot on. But on to another issue which was our somewhat overzealous, TOO ATTENTIVE waiter. I swear, this guy was at our table EVERY TEN MINUTES between six o'clock and six thirty. To say it was annoying is an understatement. The fact that he was so nice prevented me from unloading a very nasty  \"Could you please just leave us the f*&%k alone for ten bloody minutes, so we can decide what we want?!!\" He was that annoying and my friend and I agreed that we really should have said something, had we not been mellowed out by the wine. I thought, Dude...come on. It's Wednesday and dead in here. It's not like you need the table so stop rushing us! But like I said, the place was not busy so maybe he was just bored.  The food was disappointing. Very typical, middle-of-the-road Greek fare that one can get at pretty much every single restaurant on the Danforth. Nothing special. The Feta Fries while very tasty, did not live up to my other friend's rave reviews. The Greek Salad I ordered also fell flat. Iceberg lettuce......REALLY?!!! Could it not have killed them to use Romaine for a change? And as far as the much ballyhooed \"secret salad dressing?\" Mine tasted just like good old oil and vinegar and really could have used more of both.  I will say that my chicken souvlaki was the one shining star in the whole evening - tender and juicy but again, I can get the same thing anywhere. I have yet to have bad souvlaki on the Danforth.  All that to say, the only saving grace was that I had a gift certificate so I didn't have to pay for it. Upon seeing the bill, I was surprised at the amount for such a nothing dinner. I will not be returning to Kalyvia. With all the competition on the Danforth, I am very surprised that they have such a loyal following for serving such mediocre food."}
{"text":"I randomly chose this restaurant while walking around Greek town walked one Thursday night with a friend. I had the special which was this eggplant beef and cheese dish. It was so delicious I brought my fiancé the next day. Unfortunately they no longer had that on special but the waiter recommended this calamari seafood dish. It was also amazing. My fiancé had the pork chop and they were cooked very tender and moist. Really impressed by this casual family owned restaurant. We are definitely going back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I love Greek food - and I make a point of trying to find and try Greek restaurants when I travel. Living in Toronto makes finding Greek food at home very easy - but I don't just want souvlaki every time I go.  Kalyvia is a great place to go beyond souvlaki. Both lunch and dinner are covered here and do a good job of providing a few tried and tested options.   First lunch - when I go for lunchI am usually taking business associates so I need two things - good food on the table, and an attentive, but unobtrusive wait staff. I get both here. The appetizers here are great. When I go I order a number of different options, but always have the combo of 3 dips (make sure to ask for lots of pita bread, but they will bring more regardless), and the Mushrooms Kalyvia. I have tried almost all of the hot appetizers and they range from good to great, so most are a safe bet. I cannot vouch for the cold appetizers as I tend to steer away from them - no food reason - I just like my food hot. I usually add a small meat dish if people are really hungry, but it is rarely needed.  Dinner is family and close friends. My children ask for Kalyvia by name if we mention Greek food - and we have tried many of the Greek restaurants. When I go for dinners I ten to have the specials. While the menu has some interesting items on it - it is pretty standard. It is their specials that makes them stand out. The lamb shank is generally tender (which is how it should be) but also  flavorful and not gamey (which I worry about for lamb). The make a Pasticio (sp?) dish which is like a Greek variant of shepherd's pie with a béchamel sauce bake on top. When this is done right it is moist, flavorful and reminds me of my mother's cooking. It is like home here. The last dish is my favorite, but admittedly not for everyone, as it is a much heavier meal - becri mezes. This is a stewed beef, baked with a greek cheese (I should know which one, but have never thought to ask), and then served simply with some roast potatoes and rice. I love it - but it is not for the faint. Tastes great - but there are A LOT of spices hidden in that sauce (cloves, cinnamon two name two) - you have been warned.  Great places for appetizers and the specials for dinner."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good. Just take note that some dishes are big enough to share."}
{"text":"We had supper there last night.  We shared a bottle of white house wine ... it was good.  Gord ordered Ortikia (two large size quails mixed with herbs and spices baked in the oven) with rice, potatoes and veggies.  I ordered Chicken Breast Dinner (two generous pieces of char-broiled chicken filet) with rice, potatoes, veggies and tzatziki.  It was delicious!  My only complaint is that the veggies weren't fresh (they were cooked from frozen).  I'd recommend this restaurant ... the food was good and our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night before a concert. We were one of 3 tables at the time and had a great meal. Waiter very attentive and accomodating.We started with the spanikopita- it was good, not great.We both ordered the sovlaki plates, a lamb and a pork. Came with salad and bread basket.We tried the greek beer as well. Everything was delicious.My only (very minor) complaint is that the service as almost too fast- dinner delivered while we were still working on our appetizers."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kalyvia since I was in diapers, literally. I usually get the small chicken or lamb souvlaki dinner which comes with a side of rice, potatoes and greek salad. I'm always happy with my meal and the service is usually good.   FYI, the dressing on the greek salad is the sh*t. Seriously, I could drink the stuff."}
{"text":"Reading other reviews, it looks like we may have went at a bad time. We, and another     table were the only ones there for a while, and yet the service was slow.  Our Greek salads came, and it is safe to say that this was the worst salad I have ever had. I mean, how can you go wrong with a salad? There was SO MUCH dressing on it, it made the feta cheese all soupy and looked very unappetizing. Also, there was a lettuce head root in my salad which is just very unprofessional in any industrial setting. I got the Greek style spaghetti with cheese, which was just so bland, They did not even bother to put some pepper on it! The bass was drenched in oil! it was like soup. The rice was crunchy and under-cooked, there version of fries suck too. They were simply soft cold round potatoes. The halibut was very oily and the veggies were overcooked and had a weird taste.  Moreover, there are many Greek alternatives in the area, that are amazing."}
{"text":"This is really 2.5 stars almost 3.   Went during Taste of Danforth 2 wks ago.  Since it was hot and crowded outside we decided to eat indoors.  Food costs almost double as if you were to eat in the streets (ie Feta fries $2 outside, $6 inside), Gyros pita $5 vs $8 inside.  I guess that's what you pay for the seats, ac, service.  The food was meh, I've had much better greek food on Danforth.  Portions were a bit on the small side and pricey.   I ordered the 3 combo dip and it was almost like those small plastic containers you get for salad dressing and it came with a whole 1 in a half pita bread cut up.  I had asked for more pita but he forgot about it but didn't forget to charged the $3 (he did take it off after a bit explaining).  Service was so-so, although it wasn't busy I didn't see my waiter much (Mr. Vasili), But I did see him have lunch on the table across from us???  Don't think I would go back, there's much more Greek restos on Danforth to try.   If your a fellow Montrealer and crave some good Greek food, Messini restaurant which is diagonally across is very similar to home and really good.  They were packed with 3 rows of lines!"}
{"text":"We decided to try something different today. The last time we found we were not impressed with the Greek food we at at Astoria so thought we would give this place a whirl.   We started with saganki it was quite good. It had a nice bit of crunch and a good size.   Like everyone else says the tzakiki is delish and the garlic bread tasted like the good old garlic bread we had before.   My husband had the chicken breast dinner the chicken was good a little too much Dijon spice flavoring for my liking but it was good.   I had the beef souvlaki and it was good.   Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"Our first trip was today ans what a great experience! The venue was a very comfortable old world feel, but not dark as some of the ones along that strip can be. Our waiter was very good, but a tad full of himself and didnt give you a very warm fuzzy feeling with your visit. He was an older gent and has obviously been doing this a lifetime and has lost his capabilities to be warm and friendly, he is now just professional, too bad really. Our meal was fantastic! we started with the bread basket and greek salad, the bread is awesome!! and salad is really good, loads of feta! Then onto the saginaki! They do flame this at the table for you! I enjoyed this very much, but my husband found it rather salty. The house wine was very good  and not acidic. I had the chicken gyro dinner and my husband had the large pork souvlaki and both were awesome. The flavour of my gyros combined with the sauce, chicken, rice and pita was excellent!  So all in all we very much enjoyed our visit, we may try another one of the locations just to test the waters and the serving staff, but I would and already have recommended this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Kalyvia is an OK pick on the Danforth, it has some Greek dishes that are tricky to find elsewhere nearby. (sigh)  I suggest ordering off the appetizers/mezes menu and sharing. The food is much more interesting than the boring mains (souvlaki and rice, really people? Stop it, just stop...)  We tried a combo platter which was a bargain for $16.95, just enough to feed two of us for lunch. It came with keftedekia (greek meatballs), marinated octopus slices, dolmades (vineleaves stuffed with rice and beef), 2 mini spanokopitas, 2 mini tiropitas (cheese pies), and greek sausage. The dolmades still tasted quite briny (grrr!) but everything else was A-OK.  Service was good, prompt but not overly friendly.  Decor isn't as exciting or nice and some of the other places on the Danforth (Ouzeri or Pan) but Kalyvia has a more functional family dining type feel."}
{"text":"I still need to expand my Greek food horizons by checking out the plethora of restaurants on the Danforth, but its hard to when you've already found one that you thoroughly enjoy. Kalyvia is one such place.  My review could be biased because I don't ever get anything except for a beef or chicken souvlaki. Usually I find all souvlaki dinners to taste close to the same, except for the tenderness of the meat (is it dried out or not), and so for me, the 'fringe' items are the factors that decide how I review a place.  Now I am not a wine drinker, I wish I liked wine, but I don't so the wine selection I cannot comment on. I found their souvlaki to be very tender and not dried out. It could be the luck of the draw, but so far so good. I didn't have any issues with the service, and if you are one of the lucky ones to eat on their patio on a nice evening, its all the better.  Why Kalyvia stands out for me is the tzatziki sauce, the pre dinner bread, and their salad. The tzatziki sauce was very garlicy, something I enjoy, and they are very liberal with how much they give you. I have been to other places that charge for extra, which seems ridiculous to me. Their bread basket was fresh (I really enjoy bread), and I actually enjoyed their salad. I can admit that they put more oil in their salads than other places, but to me it actually made it taste better. The olive oil was rich and left a hint of vinegar taste to be enjoyed by my tastebuds.  I'm not sure of the popularity of this place (some restaurants I see lined up almost out the door), but I'm perfectly fine going to this less hyped place."}
{"text":"Been going there for years. Lately they have been dropping the ball, so from once a week I've been going once every three months but still very inconsistent. Cooks which are the owners kin have become very complacent.   Hey Hanna K. the salad dressing is olive oil, lemon juice, egg, salt, pepper and oregano.. cheers"}
{"text":"I used to love this place as the food was tasty and the portions pretty satisfying.  However, we ordered the flaming cheese and the waitress seemed afraid of it.  She pours the alcohol on it but failed to light it properly.  She then served it to us anyway.  I asked her to try and light it because that is one of the reasons we ordered it.  She declined and we were stuck with rubbery soggy cheese.  What was the point?  Such a shame because previously I really enjoyed eating here.  There is so much choice on the Danforth that there is a very small chance that I will be back."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't like the taste of the Greek food but for me they are great. I love the customer service, 5 stars for that."}
