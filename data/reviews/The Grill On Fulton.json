{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant.  I have fallen in love yet again, but I swear to god guys, I think that I'm gonna marry this one. She stole my heart when my teeth first sunk into her moist succulent pork thigh. My mouth began to salivate and instinct took care of the rest. I'm thinking about taking a picture in a tuxedo while standing  outside The Grill, and making wallet sized copies. When I go to my next family reunion I'm going to show everyone the pictures and proclaim that the restaurant and I are married. I'll be exaggerating, sure, but damn; those were some might fine beans I just ate. It was a perfect compliment to the afore mentioned pork thigh. And the rice was anything but terrible. Nicely done. Let's get hitched ;)"}
