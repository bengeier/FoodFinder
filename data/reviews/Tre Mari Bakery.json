{"text":"Pros? THE EVER SO LARGE PLETHORA OF CHOICES!
Cons? Good things come in large packages, said no one ever. 
Lolll
I once again pulled an infamous line out of my dangerously undisciplined ass: \"Yes, hi. Can I get one of everything?\" with such fortitude. But even then, the clerk who was assisting me locked a set of punch-drunk eyes to mine. I held her gaze as I have many in my past. I'm no stranger to these bewildered expressions, silent questionings of my request, with the combination of their failed attempts to withhold judgement. 
All's well that ends well...so long as I get what I came for.
Not the best Italian bakery, but I must admit, one of the most amicable!! That's a winner in my heart, just maybe not my stomach."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery in the city. Everything they make is excellent: pastries, breads, gelato, coffee, cakes. I love that it's a family business being run be the younger generation. They obviously care a lot about their community and it creates a wonderful atmosphere. Some highlights are the cannoli, their ring cakes and the olive ciabatta."}
{"text":"Been here twice now - once for pastries a year ago and last week to pick up a tiramisu birthday cake. Best tiramisu I've had!! You can tell their claims of using real, fresh eggs and dairy are true. You can taste it!"}
{"text":"If you happen to find yourself strolling along St Clair West between Lansdowne and Dufferin stop in at Tre Mari bakery. 
In the morning, grab a paper and sample the deicious Italian pastries and the most delicious cappucino while you settle into the news.
At lunch time they have hot table service with pasta's and caccitore's but my fave has got to be the mouth watering veal sandwich. 

Folks this is Corso Italia at it's finest. When I say that I mean they actually accepted Lira here up until the early '90's. There are no frills, just a few table and chairs coffee shop style, and the rest of the space is deli and bakery. Stop in to get the 30 canneloni you need last minute for that baby shower, or grab some procuitto and provolone for a quick sandwich.. go over and snag that freshly baked bun that you could smell from the moment you walked in and you've got heaven."}
{"text":"I honestly gained 15lbs over the last 2 years living in the neighbourhood and feasting on the cannolis, the vienna loaves, gelato and their lasagna. And I have no regrets. The brothers that run the place and the staff are amazing! very friendly and approachable even though the store is packed from the church crowd, you don't feel rushed by staff and the quality is always great."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to live within a few different food-friendly neighbourhoods within Toronto and have frequented some really cool local bakeries. None of them are as good as Tre Mari Bakery. 

This family-run local Corso Italia gem has been in business since 1960, and offer what I consider to be the best fresh-baked bread in the city. I know of many customers who trek from the suburbs and elsewhere out of town to come here just for the bread.

However, Tre Mari offers much more than just fresh bread. They have a full deli counter, with an excellent assortment of meats and cheeses, a grocery aisle, with all the essentials (milk, eggs, frozen dinners, etc.), a take-out/dine-in counter, featuring pasta, sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pizza, and of course, a dessert counter.

Let's talk about the desserts. 

I am not ashamed to admit that I've tried most, if not all of their desserts. Having a girlfriend with a sweet tooth helps, as does their tantalizing dessert display that greets you right as you walk in the store. All of their desserts are made fresh daily, which means they are as soft/gooey/crunchy/flavourful as possible.

They have an assortment of amaretto cookies that are just about the best cookies you'll find anywhere. 

They have an assortment of squares/tarts/pastries that are dangerously habit-inducing.

They have tiramisu, cakes, pies, doughnuts, and zeppole.

Oh, and they have cannoli. Now, I've had many cannoli in my day. I grew up with Italian friends and neighbours, and was served home-made cannoli many times during my childhood. I enjoyed them, but never went out of my way to eat them, or thought much about them until I tried cannoli at Tre Mari.

THIS IS THE BEST DAMN CANNOLI I HAVE EVER CONSUMED IN MY LIFE. 

I don't know what sorcery is at play here, but Tre Mari's cannoli are so good I am *compelled* to buy them each time I set foot in the store. The chocolate and pistachio-flavoured ones are incomparably delicious.

Tre Mari also offers catering and delivery services, as well as gift baskets and custom cakes. 

Their service is impeccable. The Deleo family is always friendly and helpful, and go out of their way to say hello or offer assistance when needed.

To sum up, Tre Mari rises far above the title of \"great local neighbourhood bakery\". It is a destination for many devout and loyal customers and offers much more than just baked bread. I feel fortunate to live within walking distance of this family-run Toronto treasure."}
{"text":"I used to not understand why people liked cannoli. It was never a dessert that tickled my fancy. Now I know that I'd just never had GOOD cannoli. I have since tried cannoli at Tre Mari and can't get enough. It's the best. Just thinking about it makes me think that I will probably have to go there tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Picked up a tiramisu cake and a bunch of canolis for a Christmas dinner and man was it awesome.  I'm usually not a fan of tiramisu and I loved it, best stuff I've ever had.  The canolis were nice, fresh, and light tasting.

Between the 8 inch cake and 13 canolis, only Â¼ of the cake and 3 canolis were left after turducken between 9 people.  I call that a success.

Can't recommend this place enough.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had to order a cake for delivery at a very short notice of less than 24 hrs. I called up Tre Mari Bakery and got connected to Franco Deleo and he assured me that he'll be able to take my order even at such short notice and get it delivered. The cake I selected was one of the specialty cake which was another task which Franco accomplished perfectly. Now I was ordering this from another country and I need some flowers and balloons to be delivered along with the cake. Upon my request Franco said he will be more than willing to pick up the other stuff as well  along the way and he'll personally deliver everything together. He went out of the way to accommodate my request which was very sweet of him. Both the cake & the flowers turned out to be absolutely amazing,  everything turned out as per the plan and it got delivered exactly during the time limit which I requested. I am extremely happy with the service I received and will definitely want to visit the bakery if I get a chance to visit Canada anytime soon. 

Thanks Franco!"}
{"text":"The cannoli is so amazing. The pistachio ones especially.   Pizza is also very good and so is the espresso. I can't  praise them enough.  The staff were so pleasant.  Go there."}
{"text":"Love their pastries, awesome veal sandwich, busy but worth the waiting."}
{"text":"I've read many reviews about this place so decided to give it a try. I ordered a vanilla cannoli, pistachio cannoli, strawberry butterfly, tiramisu cake slice, lemon peach and a strawberry tart. Wellll...The vanilla and pistachio cannoli's had absolutely NO flavour which was disappointing. The strawberry butterfly was very fresh, yet the filling (whipped cream) was tasteless for the exception of the strong egg flavour from the dough. The tiramisu slice was amazing, the best I've had thus far. The tiramisu was moist and filled will flavour. The lemon peach had an artificial taste to it. It literally tasted like a tim bit with a tasteless custard filling. The strawberry tart was horrible and tasteless. The filling was a whipped cream filling rather than the usual custard, which was a plus, yet the filling had no flavour. The strawberries and shell had flavour and the filling seemed like the artificial stuff supermarkets use on their birthday cakes.. I gave this place 2 stars because the tiramisu was amazing. I'm not entirely sure how this bakery got such great reviews. Their pastries definitely need some revamping."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the veal. The portion size was massive and was quite delicious. It was hard to choose just one dessert item from the bakery side because there is a huge selection. I ended up getting the pistachio cannoli and have no complaints :)"}
{"text":"I had a sudden craving for cannoli the past couple of days and came here because of the reviews and I wasn't disappointed. I'm not a cannoli connoisseur, but the ones that I had were really good and had a good price (small ones for less than $2) and they had a big variety of other baked goods. 

It had a very nice and friendly atmosphere. They had their sections well divided between the deli (all the cheeses and meats!), breads, baked snacks and the hot food plus an area for sitting down. People working there were delightful. 

Definitely a place I recommend."}
{"text":"The food may be very good but the service here sucks big time. Twice I have picked out a bunch of groceries and carried them to the counter only to have the girls behind he counter full out ignore me and ask the other customers to come up to be cashed out. At first I thought I was imagining this so I waited a bit until one woman who was behind me was aske to come up to be cashed out and I was still there holding my items. I placed all the my things down and left the bakery. The next time the same thing happened only this time I slammed the things down an asked them why this was happening. The girls looked at me and then continued to cash out the other customers again. So I yelled again and walked out. Never stepped foot in this place again."}
{"text":"In general I like this place. People are friendly, the food is good. However I recently ordered a small cheese/meat plate for a party and was very disappointed. It was $59 and meant to feed 10. The portion was reasonable, but the product was weak. The cheese was mild havarti and some generic cheddar, and the meat was two kids of ham. I was expecting something more interesting and sophisticated for the price."}
{"text":"Been eating cakes and pasteries, and sandwiches hot and fresh, regular place to find melanzana, saporita!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place- 100% italian. The real thing, close to home. Friendly staff, great authentic food, fast customer service. I will recommend to all! I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"I started going to Tre Mari recently - my nonno had recently passed away (my nonna back in 2003), and I wanted to connect to my family heritage more (if only I had thought about doing this when they were still around!). When they came to Canada in the early 1950s, they lived in Corso Italia, along with all of the other recent Italian immigrants of the time (they later followed the suburban dream to Scarborough).  

So I decided to explore the neighbourhood. Alongside the St. Nicola Di Bari church (Bari is where my family is originally from!), I was able to find traces of my family at Tre Mari Bakery. While I can't say for sure that my grandparents ever shopped here (I get the feeling they didn't, my nonna liked to make her own bread), the spirit of Italian-Canadians runs deep in this place. From the ciabatta to the hot table to the cannoli (and all the other pastries!), this shop gives me the feeling of being among family once again.    

I'm so glad that institutions like this exist in the city - not just for the history, but because the food is damn delicious to boot."}
{"text":"Most favorite bakery - moved into area just over a year ago and Tre Mari ranks up there with the best that Italy has.  Everything is good, from the fresh baked bread to the sweets to the hot food.  Definitely worth a visit !"}
{"text":"We were walking down St. Clair toward La Paloma, when the display in Tre Mari's window caught our eye: an oven with fake donuts and desserts. We each have a huge sweet tooth, so we immediately went on in.

I'd lived in the area for two years without ever going in. It just never really caught my eye before. But oh man, I wish I'd been sooner.

They've got a huge selection of buns, meat and cheese. They also serve Italian food, which looked so good. We'd just eaten dinner, so we opted for dessert. There was so much to choose from that it was hard to pick. But it was so good that we went back two days later a few more things.

They do charge 25 cents if you want to pay with debit and your order is less than $10. But it's a very affordable place - less than $4 for two desserts. The best part is it's open late. I'm not sure what their hours are, but both times we've gone in past 8 p.m. - when everything else on St. Clair is long closed."}
{"text":"I had a cup of coffee and custard tart. They are good. There are many kinds of pastries. Their decoration is very nice and grab my attention. They are not so expensive.  There are many seats ans the place is spacious.  It is nice place to have a cup of coffee and snacks."}
{"text":"Have been here only 2x for lunch but always exceeds my expectations.  Food is always fresh and homemade.  Staff are amazing and pleasant to deal with.  

Whenever I am I the area seeing clients this is my go-to spot."}
{"text":"Love Tre Mari! The quality of the food is terrific, and the prices are quite reasonable. I much prefer to get deli meat here, as I can get a small quantity for a good deal.
It's so nice to stop in on the weekend and get a treat- a loaf of fresh bread and some meat and cheese, maybe some of their yummy new French Macarons."}
{"text":"Authentic cannoli! We had pistachio cannoli. It's crispy and fresh. And the sweetness is just perfect."}
{"text":"Fresh Ricotta, fresh bread and great Cannoli.  Well, that was basically my meal.  This place has all sorts of deli and pastries along with lots of Italian specialties,  just walking into this place puts a smile on my face.
Definitely a place that I would revisit over and over again."}
{"text":"So I came back for the second time because my family decided they wanted another veal sandwich so I brought upon myself  the most delicious and scrumptious slice of cheese pizza it was fresh,crispy and homemade and I absolutely loved I did not try the veal sandwich because I'm a vegetarian but from what I heard and saw everyone seemed to be enjoying it quite well for the second time. I tried the rice ball that was there but out of all the rice balls I've had this one was not so good and I've tries quite a lot but overall I highly recommend the pizza the veal sandwich. Tres Marie bakery has 5 different types of pizza cheese, pepperoni,broccoli,vegetarian,and bacon and onion. LOVE THIS PLACE....."}
{"text":"Oh so good...one of my top places for Italian desserts. Fresh cannoli every time. Their cookies...yummm. The food from their hot bar station is not as good but edible. You don't really come here for their hot food anyway. Great selection of imported Italian groceries and solid deli section. Feeling a craving for Tre Mari tonight."}
{"text":"Nostalgia galore. This isn't your snobbish italian place, it's your family run, humble, homely, italian place. And that's the way I like it."}
{"text":"Bread excellent, zeppole when in season excellent, cannoli ok but missing the candied fruit. Beware, many things are NOT made there anymore like the aranchini (rice balls) at the hot table. Service incredibly slow, painfully so at the best of times, and hardly a smile except for the owners raking in the bucks. Absolutely overpriced and pizza terrible. Amaretti very good but again $$$$."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while in the area. Warm and friendly Italian atmosphere full of life. Had a Latte and grilled veggie panini with prosciutto for a snack  plus a cannoli for desert. The cannoli was so good I ended up buying a dozen to take home for a family occasion. 

P.S.  Buy a dozen and get one free!"}
{"text":"You guys...this place SMELLS AMAZING. Like my Italian grandmother's house. I walked in and it was the first thing I noticed: before the pastries, hot food, or anything else. 

The pastries were similar to what I have when I visit my grandmother's little town in Italy, and just as amazing. Everything is really fresh. There's a small grocery selection as well in case you need some imported Italian pantry supplies.

On the hot food front, holy crap. So tasty. I got a meatball sub and for $6 got something that tasted perhaps better* than the meatballs my grandmother used to make, on really fresh, soft bread.

Plus, for baking nerds like me, they sell fresh yeast!!

*please don't tell her I said that."}
{"text":"A very old school very delicious Italian bakery. Lots of atmosphere, a good hot table and great cold cuts and pastries!"}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone can think this is quality.  The deserts have artificial ingredients and taste awful.  The cannoli are among the worst I have tried in Toronto.  Fried shell where you can taste the oil and artificial flavours. Go downtown for quality Italian pastries."}
{"text":"The while box of pastries in my picture only cost $12.45 because after 6 pastries you don't pay the tax! Such a great deal! I doubted it at first, but everyone is right! The pistachio is the best flavor of cannoli  and a definite must try item. It has such a subtle, decadent flavor I really enjoyed without being too sweet. I also ordered a great tiramisu and cream horn! Can't wait to come back earlier to snag more cannoli!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and its an amazing place to get a snack or fresh coffee. This is a place where you can also get amazing choices of Charcuteries and cheeses and Fresh baked breads and pastries!! I always get the pistachio flavored cannoli and also the sorbets are worth trying. It could've been nice if they have a patio but other than that, they're a very good place to relax on the weekend with family and friends. Will also recommend it for cooked foods on their buffet line if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I've been coming here for years for their cannolis! My cousins from the states request treats from here since they can't find anything like it in Pittsburgh. Great price for great food. There's also seating space if you'd like to pop in for a sit down lunch or snack."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm Italian and sometime I really want to taste some of the cookies and sweets of my childhood, but I don't have the time to make them, and my nonna is no longer able to either. Honestly, this place has THE BEST cookies and pastries. When I want to buy cookies or cannolli or sfogliatelle to take to a staff party or for when I have people over, I go here and get a beautiful selection and I'm never disappointed. These cookies are exactly how they are supposed to taste, they bring me right back to my childhood.
The grocery store also has a lot of the traditional italian items that you might need for cooking at home. And their hot foods are amazing too. I love their lasagna and eggplant parmigiana. The people that work here are super friendly as well. If you're looking for some real good italian food for yourself or for a party, I would DEFINITELY come here. It's clean, the service is nice and friendly, and most important the FOOD IS AMAZING."}
{"text":"The aroma of fresh baked bread, the display cases full of cookies, cakes and pastries that are as appealing to the eye as you know they will be to the stomach and a smiling staff behind the counters let me know this was a place I would love at first glance.

Bakeries work long hard hours to produce quality products...and having a staff that adds customer service on top of that is my kind of business to shop.  Staying on St. Clair with a very good friend for a couple of days she let me know that we HAD to get cookies.   Purchase cookies wedid, a few times...and even just before I hopped into a cab to head back to the States!

I loved the sweet, chewy and crunchy crust of the almond cookies the best....and wish I had some right now!  The wire shelves holding an assortment of fresh baked baguettes, rolls and other artisan offerings was amazing.  Having been in this business myself a few years back, I appreciated the simplicity of their presence in the neighborhood, no frills, no neon....just good food served by good people.

I wish I had time to sample the pizza and other hot dishes I saw being readied for the lunch crowd....but that will be another culinary adventure when I return.....and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"The service was 5 star, the product I received this time only 3 stars. I say this because I went in  for cannoli, left with macarons,This was only because they where out of the cannoli, the worker offered to make me some fresh(note to self;take that offer next time) but I was hungry and wanted satisfaction then and there. So I got the macarons 2 chocolate fudge,2 chocolate,2 Canadian maple and 2 roasted coconut. Yesterday the others had a flakey consistency like what I've usually experienced the roasted coconut was a bit harder then the others. I put a few away to test a theory on the freshness of the macrons while the others hardened a tad in the fridge over night, the roasted coconut was as hard as a rock. In closing if you visit and have the chance to get a cannoli made fresh or already made take it. And if you are going to try the Macrons, the chocolate fudge is best the rest are ok but the roasted coconut just isn't up to the par set by the others."}
{"text":"Best pastries everrr. The zeppoles they make at Easter are to die for, and the Tiramisu is the best I've ever had! I only wish they would give you more than a plastic fork and styrofoam plate when you order for here. Otherwise it would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best amaretti cookies in the city, hands down! The family is always welcoming and friendly, the pastries are always fresh and the coffee is always good"}
{"text":"I'm not very well verse in Italian specialties, so I can't comment on the authenticity, but this place seems legit. They sell everything Italian from the bakery (wide variety of breads, antipasto, sweets, packaged snacks), deli meats, coffee and sandwiches. If you want a speciality snack, this is the place to go. Seems like a lot of locals come here.

I got a tiramisu and an amaretto crescent cookie. The cake is very frothy and sweet, I only had a few bites because it was rich. But you can really taste the coffee, and the cookie has a strong almond flavour as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have a little morning break italian style and completely stumbled upon this place.
Apparently it's been there for nearly 60 years and its a full on bakery, deli, coffee shop etc. etc. 
What I liked about it was the authenticity, lots of old pictures of the italian family who owns it and the food too. dont forget that. lot's of italian baked goods!
I had a nice grilled focaccia with vegies and mozzarella + a nice cup of coffee.
Was great. will come again."}
{"text":"Solid Italian bakery, deli, and grocery store run by four brothers.

My fave items here from the hot table are the arancini, paninis, and pizza. Food is fresh and tasty, you can opt to eat in the little cafe or take to go.

They also sell various Italian grocery items as well as fresh breads and deli meats.

Loads of different traditional Italian pastries and treats. My favourite cannoli are the little chocolate chip ones - yum!

The most recent time we stopped in we tried the gelato panini - really unique, a brioche bread stuffed with your choice of housemade gelato and then grilled - yay!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of varieties to choose from in general. 
Not impressed by their hot table. Small portions, and dry food. Lack of flavour.
Tiramisu was good, not too sweet yet strong espresso flavour to it.
I have had much better experience at other Italian bakeries in the GTA."}
{"text":"They need to hurry up with their renovations. I miss this place and would go almost everyday. They carry this cheese called, Tuma....amazing!!!!! Also I never realized their was a difference in deli meat because I've only ever ate their soppresseta but I bought some at another bakery and it sucked! I can't wait until they re-open!"}
{"text":"Had great coconut gelato and bought fantastic fresh olive ciabatta loaf. Super awesome toasted with butter!  In past visits, the pastries have also been fantastic. Even the plain honey doughnuts are amazing."}
{"text":"Beat cannoli that I EVER HAD!! Try the pistachio one, it really die for!!
The place was not a simple bakery, it has lots of Italian fine food, cheese, olive, salami, and gelato in the store. It also provides various kinds of prepared food like pizza, pasta, sandwich and meat balls. All of them are fabulous. The marinate sauce was fresh and delicious, the pizza was not too thin or too thick and the breads were so aromatic. This place was much better than some bakeries in little Italy downtown, although it located in the centre of corso Italy( which is actually another Italian town of Toronto).
I spent an hour to riding to this place but worth it. I would come back many times for their delicious food."}
{"text":"Well, finally last Friday, I got to give this place a try since people have given it many favorable reviews, and I really wanted to check it out.

I'm just going to speak for the food. My sole purpose of coming here was to continue my quest for finding some of the best cannolis in the city. Did I find them here? Not yet. I had a pistachio filled one and a chocolate filled one. Sure they tasted good, but did they make me go \"whoa, right on!\"? Nope. But I do want to try the other pastries like the babas which some of my friends have spoken highly of. 
I'm definitely sure this is also the place that features that Gelatio in a Brioche bun.
Also I've recently developed a craving for arancini and decided to try one here. I don't even remember what was in the middle of it but the little rice ball wasn't warm, and the tomato sauce as well, just didn't do to compliment the flavor of it.

Maybe I didn't go at a good time.  
I might just have to venture there again and take a box of pastries home for a quiet movie night, or to have something sweet to start off the morning.
Maybe that will help develop a better taste and appreciation for what's offered at Tre Mari."}
{"text":"By Far The Best Veal Sandwiches in Toronto! Lunch Dinner, Late Night! I'm always down for a Veal Sandwich from Tre Mari Bakery! I recommend this place to All My friends when there in the mood for a Good Veal Sandwich! 

Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Classic Toronto old school Italian. Great vibe, service and food. Hot lunch. Great pastries. And of course superb coffee. This mangiacake loves it. Great place for a weekend lunch."}
{"text":"Classic Italian bakery , what more can you ask for. Some of the best freshly baked bread in the city, deli is always fresh , nice selection of pastries ... try the rum baba or peach shaped cake with pastry cream. Yummy"}
{"text":"Just an addendum:  My partner just returned from a trip to Italy as said that the canollis he had in Naples paled in comparison to this place.

They should be called \"La Regina di Canolli\""}
{"text":"It is a family owned restaurant opened for 50 years staff very friendly really good gelato and even let me sample what I really appreciate it about the desserts are it is not that sweet."}
{"text":"Very similar to San Remo (on the West-end), Lazar (in Mississauga), Monastery (Oakville) or any large, Italian bakery for that matter.  

Tre Mari seems to be an institution on St. Clair W., and it has a section where bread is displayed, a counter for deli meats & cheese, 2-3 sections with various pastries and baked goods, a gelato section, a hot table, and a coffee bar.  This place is pretty big!

Choose what you want at the various counter(s), you may have to take a number for the pastries, then cash out in the front.  The experience can be a bit intimidating, especially when it's busy, and it was on a Sunday afternoon.

I had a Nata tart - pretty good, not sickeningly sweet - and a pistachio cannoli which was really good, pastry was actually crispy which is rare.  Well, at least I haven't had one with a crispy pastry in a while.

Tons of people seated inside/out, eating gelato, a veal sandwich, sipping an espresso.  So they can't be all wrong, right?  Staff was pretty friendly.  No attitude here.  Interior can use some updating."}
{"text":"Whenever I meet someone from out of town, and they ask me to describe Toronto, I tell him or her that Toronto is a city of neighbourhoods. 

I know that people often point to our \"rich cultural diversity\" or our \"commitment to multiculturalism\" but respectfully, I think that those labels miss the point. Diversity and multiculturalism are wonkish words; they describe the place, but not the people; and the true character of a city lies in its citizens. 

This is why I love Tre Mari. 

As old-school Italian bakeries go, it's as old school as it gets. 

If you google the joint, you see that it's located on \"Corso Italia\"; in the heart of one of the city's ethnic enclaves. This is true, and if you were to drive on over you'd find yourself in the middle of kitchenware stores, clothing shops and bars, coffee shops and restaurants all blaring whatever soccer match is on TV.  But then, if you drove you'd miss how the neighbourhood changes along St. Clair. Going West on foot you pass Jewish, Jamaican, Filipino, Portuguese and Hungarian shops, with the added Thai or fusion spot thrown in for good measure. It's Toronto in a few blocks. Besides which, you get to build up your appetite. At Tre Mari, you'll need it. 

Ask me what's good, I'll just answer \"yes\". The space is old and worn, divided into a bakery with pastries out front and bread in the back on one side, and a hot table/cafe on the other. A small deli and refrigerated section take up some space as well, but most of their wares are available elsewhere at lower prices. 

The ambiance speaks to a time before communities became tourist destinations. One one hand, service is warm and friendly. On the other, it takes a few visits before you feel completely welcome. 

It's worth braving the initial indifference for some of the best bread in Toronto. Some local celebrity chefs may try to sell bread at grossly inflated prices, but it pales in comparison to Tre Mari's loaves. 

A lack of signage makes ordering a crapshoot, but since it's all good and inexpensive, roll the dice. I skip lighter-weight french rolls and baguettes in favour of more substantial fair; a flour-dusted Calabrese rectangle contrasts brittle crust with chewy, airy crumb. Olive and herb breads slicked with oil are softer and springier. A multigrain loaf is substantial and hearty, as is a round, docked pide bread covered in sesame seeds. If you're the DIY pizza type, it invites you to cover it in good mozzarella, then tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan for a homemade knock-off Sicilian Slice. 

Pastries are uniformly excellent. Cannoli are worth leaving the firearms at home for. Napoleans soothe with proper custard. Donuts, while not Italian, are archetypes that put Timmy to shame. Drip coffee is pointless, but espresso-based beverages are worth a double-shot. 

 Even better, I have yet to pay more than four dollars for a bread that could feed me for a week. 

The cafe is the most interesting part of the restaurant. Apart from very decent pizza and the usual buffet suspects, the room is testament to how neighbourhoods change; it is equally divided between the people who built Tre Mari and supported it from it's birth, to a flood of Ethiopian immigrants. The groups mostly keep to themselves; unless someone scores a goal, and the place erupts as one. 

That's Toronto."}
{"text":"Despite its old-school origins, Tre Mari has definitely evolved into more of a new school Italian place - bakery, hot-plate, take-out, catering, grocery, all-in-one place for people who want more than just to pick up some bread or a hot sandwich.

They know that the local families and neo-hipsters want a few whole wheats and ryes alongside their dinner rolls, some sliced turkeybreast with their provolone, an iced tea instead of Brio and a doughnut for the kids alongside their cappuccino.

The deli section is the reason to visit.  Tre Mari has many hard to find cold cuts, often imported from Italy - often three types of porchetta, five types of prosciutto and mortadella, two types of *real*authentic*sopressa*veneto* (you have to go to Hamilton to get this stuff!), real, aged artisanal capicolo, dry-cured cacciatore sausage (none of this vacuumed-sealed stuff).  Plus, the usual Italo-Canadian staples (Mastro, San Daniele, etc.) as well as some more anglo chicken, turkeys, and hams.  I mean, who else in this city carries paisanella?

The rest?  Good coffee and canoli, solid Italian breads and buns, average sandwiches and pizza, reasonable non-Italian baked goods, and lasagnas/pastas only fit for mangiacakes."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... better than average with the Amaretti and Chocolate Chip Cannoli being 4 to 5 star.  I would give an overall 4 star if the service improves.

A clearly beloved Italian neighbourhood bakery that has its regulars come in to enjoy an espresso and cannoli.  I was finally in the area to check it out and try the famed cannoli myself.  This bakery is far bigger than I expected with a full service hot plate area with everything from veal sandwiches to dinners, large seating area, gelato, a large deli counter, espresso drinks, and all the sweet baked Italian goods.

We came after dinner and was hoping for a light sweet bite to close out the night.  The bakery allows a lot of light and there are many tables available to sit down.  Most of the tables were clean.  One clear misstep was the service... there was maybe only 1 person every 5 or 10 minutes trying to order something from the various sections.  I spotted at least 1 to 2 employees at each counter.  All counters except the actual cashier area was very slow.  I stood in front of the cakes while a young lady stood in the middle of the gelato, cookies, and cakes hunched over reading something.  I was like for around 5 minutes before the cashier finished cashing out someone and yelled out her name to make her be aware I was waiting.  I saw this a few times.  Off day with service perhaps?

Cannoli (vanilla and chocolate chip ricotta) - I say these prefilled and was worried as it was 8 pm and I know that a pre-filled cannoli is not usually a good sign.  We still ordered 2 mini cannolis... one a simple vanilla and the other chocolate chip ricotta.  I took a bite of the chocolate chip one and was pleasantly surprised how the pastry still had a nice crunch to it.  It wasn't soggy.  The sweetness was good and not overwhelming.  It could have a bit more flavour (I usually love a bit of candied citrus to offer something more than just sugar).  The vanilla one wasn't as good since the shell was definitely more soggy... it wasn't crispy and absorbed some of the filling already.  The filling had a tiny hint of vanilla and lightly sweet.  Not bad but the shell was a disappointment.   4/5 for chocolate chip and 3.5/5 vanilla

Amaretti (almond and maraschino topped) - They have an entire section just dedicated to amaretti and wow, these were just great.  Full almond flavour that is not too sweet but very good.  The texture was pleasantly chewy and for the ones that had a dusting of powdered sugar had a light thin crispy sugary shell... the maraschino cherry ones were the best as it gave a great cherry flavour (dont get the candied ones!) 5/5

Sfogliatelle - These were gorgeous... flakey layers all nicely seperated with a nice bronze colour.  These were really well made.  When I took a bite, the layers all shattered and was nice to keep that crunch even it was baked hours ago.  What was unfortunate was the filling... even after 3 large bites to try to get to the filling, I kept finding air pockets.  There was very little filling and what was there sank all to the back.  It had a bit of vanilla but not much.  3.5/5

Butter cookies (blueberry and raspberry -  These were really confusing as they were called butter cookies but after taking a bite, there was no taste of butter and incredibly soggy.  It did come from a case that had a lot of humidity in it as the case was filled with water drops on the glass.  These were more expensive than the cannoli so I was expecting something more but with it having no flavour and lacklustre texture, this was disappointing.  I will admit that it looked very good.  3/5

I wish I could give this place a 4 star because they do have some great items... just the service seemed really inattentive and bored."}

I may have to go back to try again and not on a late Sunday evening. Canollis were OK, amaretti were pretty good, but I was not that flabbergasted by this place. Missing the waouh factor (far from it att his point)."}
{"text":"Tre Mari has to be one of my favourite bakeries, and has the best ciabatta I have had the pleasure of eating yet!

Previous reviewers have it right- it's an old-school, New World Italian bakery. It's been around since 1960, and on the walls are pictures of the various owners. It occupies two storefronts, one of which is taken up by the bakery racks, deli counter and a modest grocery section, and the other is occupied by the hot table and cafe, which serves up espresso and red-sauce Italian food at reasonable prices. The cake and cookie case and the main cash take up the centre. 

The bread is the highlight- spaccatelli buns with a crisp crust that shatters delightfully and a light, airy crumb, to a rich, dense, chewy ciabatta that needs no adornments to savour. Most breads are available as buns or loaves, and you can even bring them over to the deli to have a sandwich made. They stock traditional salami and capicollo, and even imported Italian cheeses. The only oddity is that I don't think I have ever paid the same price for a sandwich! Glass bottles of Coke and cans of chinotto make an ideal accompaniment.

The desserts are delicious too, from the cannolli to the diplomatico (think Napoleon with a chocolate custard layer).

Definitely worth a trip, you'll never leave without something in your stomach or tucked under your arm!"}
{"text":"I love this bakery because it brings me back to a time of nostalgia. They still have the old fashion pastries from the 70s that bring back so much memories with just one taste.

Hot table has a great variety of food. Love the pizza."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Tre Mari. Their desserts are to die for and the cheese selection is fantastic. I don't usually eat at the hot table - it's a bit overpriced for what it is - but I frequently come here for meats, cheeses, and especially the cannoli!"}
{"text":"One word: old school. 
This bakery is nestled in the italian part of town. Not only is it a bakery, but they are a deli, grocery and a cafeteria. They serve great slices of cheese, meats, pizza, subs, and gnocchi. I plan on coming back here to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Oh thank Goodness its just renovations. I thought they had closed down like some many signature areas in the area. Thank you Miss Julia V. for that clarification. 

I miss going in there from time to time just to have a nice cappuccino & mingle with the people. 

I like the staff very much. They make me want to hug them. 

They have some very good breads and love the deli counter."}
