{"text":"Stopped here with some colleagues before heading to the airport and was really impressed. I had the grilled veggie panini with fries both of which were really yummy. Lots of veggies on the sandwich, hand cut fries, and nothing was overly greasy. Good service and decent atmosphere I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"How does this place have nearly 5 stars? The only positive thing I can say is that the waitress was super friendly, and the menu is huge.   Where to begin...  -The smoked meat was mediocre at best.  -The beer was expensive.  -The beer on tap options were super limited.  -The fries were just okay.  -Table d'hôte dessert was just plain bad.  I ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was decent, but the smoked meat wasn't great. My 2 lunch dates had the smoked meat sandwiches on the table d'hôte and were both disappointed with their food.   For a deli & \"bar\", the beer selection is pitiful. Most restaurants have more beer on tap than Moe's does.  Pitchers for $21 (or a 20oz glass for $7.25) are not such a great deal...  I expected better prices for a place with \"bar\" in its name.  If you don't like the tap options, your choices of bottled beer are plentiful, but at $8 a bottle, it's hard to get excited about it.   This was my first visit in about 10 years, and will be my last for life. I seriously don't understand how this place has good ratings."}
{"text":"I have passed Moes literally a hundred times but listened to friends and family who told me there were better similar places in the area.  Those friends and family are very very wrong. This turned out to be one of the best lunches that I have ever had on the West Island.  When I walked in I was a bit taken aback that they were so busy. The host asked if I would mind sitting in the bar area and I accepted. I'm glad I did because it was quieter than the main dining room and the service and attention to detail was exceptional.  I ordered the Super Smoked Meat Sandwich Medium Fat Plate. A half pound of smoked meat between two pieces of fresh rye bread that comes with French fries and coleslaw.  The smoked meat is as good as you will find anywhere in Montreal. Melt in your mouth. Slightly spicy. Perfect. The rye bread soft in the center with a crispy crust which is not so easy to find anywhere.  The fries were perfect Montreal fries and the coleslaw was slightly creamy and exactly to my taste.  Service was impeccable and the establishment is very clean. This is now my new favorite spot on the West Island."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple.  The smoked meat. That's all I've tried here and that's what I will keep ordering. It is GOOD! I got the Reuben sandwich, which was smoked meat, sauerkraut, swiss cheese and some russian dressing on pumpernickel bread.   TASTEGASM!  So, so good. The smoked meat was juicy, tasty and felt 'fresh', if that makes any sense. The fries, on the other hand, was a bit too greasy and soggy for my tastes. The waiter had assured me that they cut them by hand and fry them, and that its \"not McCains\". But.. greasy. I wasn't a fan.  We also had the Ferrero Rocher cake, which was huge and quite good.  Service was passable. I wish he asked me if the fries were okay, because we pretty much left it untouched."}
{"text":"Stayed a week in Montreal, this was the best meal we had all week. Great staff, they were really on it. food came out fast. The Cajun salmon was probably the best salmon I've ever had. cooked perfectly, served with a spicy Cajun glaze, and the sun dried tomato angel hair pasta was  outstanding. It was a Wednesday night and they were very busy, so you know they're doing things right. Definitely be back next time in town."}
{"text":"So I went with my family to try Moe's (it's about time). I am gald I did, I always wanted to do so since it's a known resto for Montrealers. I was in West Island, near Fairview mall and just hungry!  We started with garlic bread and caesar salad. Our main dish was the \"Poutine with steak and blue cheese\" plate. I honestly enjoyed it a lot, just exactly what I imagined. However, be aware, you might find it salty due to the blue cheese. I mean it IS salty, but I like salt and like my Poutine to be salty.  If I go again there, I would order the very same thing.  The Ambience is nice, friendly staff and nice low lights."}
{"text":"It asked for the Ruben's smoked meat sandwich. I attached  a picture. It was awesome. Just delicious.   The waitress was super kind and the service was really fast. Had the sandwich within a couple of minutes. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Still bad attitude  Over priced and food is terrible Do not waste your money or time Better breakfast and lunch places in DDO SMOKEMEAT was fatty and tough The eggs were not cooked The potatoes and fries were cold Waiter says having a bad day  And our reply was maybe the cook should learn to cook and you should learn how to do your job without attitude"}
{"text":"Moes is a primo West Island \"Institution\". Great food, portions & professional service. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. Nothing to complain about this place, good atmosphere, lots of booths, fast and friendly service, good all around place when everyone wants something different. Known for their smoked meat and pizzas everything is good on the menu. Except the rotisserie chicken, the only meal I didn't enjoy here."}
{"text":"Really good smoked meat.  Great fries too.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Fun spot and great breakfast. Bar area can be fun as well. Very involved ownership so service is always top notch.  A tad expensive for the portions you get but a huge variety of plates"}
{"text":"A local counterpart of mine said a trip to Montreal would not be complete without a smoked meat sandwich. Running short on time and wanting to stay relatively close to the airport Moe's was a great option.   Luckily we made it for just as happy hour was starting so small beers were on special!  I ordered the jumbo smoked meat sandwich which came with cole slaw and fries.   The sandwich was simple; Bread, Meat and Mustard. simplistic and tasty but not mind blowing.  Yes, the sandwich was jumbo but it was not match for me. I killed all 3 components and still had room for a few beers..  For those like me who have never had this Montreal delicacy, the best descriptor I can think of for smoked meat is it's similar to a salt beef sandwich that you would get in the UK. In addition  you use regular yellow mustard on this vs brown mustard like it's Brit counterpart.   I still prefer a Reuben over smoked meat/salt beef. But would still recommend this place for out of towners for a smoked meat experience.   Service Bar girls were great company and great French teaches. They also were good at their job too! They made sure I never had an empty glass in front of me.    Overall it's a great place to stop and have dinner and a drink. I approve!...  Cheers!"}
