{"text":"Went for the Tuesday $6.99 lunch special.  Can't go wrong with the price.  Ordered medium rare burger, received medium well.  But it was still very good  and juicey.  Burger had a great smokey flavor.  Service was about average.   After my second visit I'm giving it another star.  The meatloaf was awesome.  The sauce they put on the meat and vegetables was amazing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. They are located in an remodeled movie theater and it has a good casual vibe. We were there for a late lunch and had no problems with service. The burgers are delicious and the chicken salad wrap is great too. They have a good beer selection on tap. Prices were actually cheaper than expected. Looked like they have some good happy hour deals too. No complaints!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  We didn't even get to try the food because the service was so bad we left. We had reservations but still had to wait to be seated. The 3 hosts were almost never at the stand until a huge line was at the door and then they were overwhelmed. Finally we were seated but then we were not greeted for over 15 minutes. A table that was sat after us was greeted before us. We watched many servers go by but no one stopped. By the time our server came to us we were about to get up. Against our better judgment, we order simple drinks, wine and a bourbon and ginger, to give them a second chance. It was restaurant week and maybe the server was overloaded.  We were right next to the bar and watched our server go back and forth and never brought our drinks. We saw her even standing around aimlessly but never looking for our drinks, never coming back to see if wanted water or to take our order.  After about 15 more minutes we gave up and left."}
{"text":"Updated review:  This is a downgrade from last year's 5 star rating.  We sort of stopped going to Nicks for a good while because of some issues, mostly with poor / slow service.  My wife suggested that we give them another try. It hasn't improved.  Apparently we are not the only people who feel that way because on a Saturday night there were only a handfull of customers in the place.  We used to have to wait for a table on a Saturday night, but last night two thirds of the tables were empty. The food was just OK.  I had prime rib and my wife had a steak, both with salads and baked potato.  We asked for \"loaded\" baked potato, but were disappointed to receive a plain dry spud and only a little cup of sour cream.  Not even any butter was served.  Disappointing. But, the most irritating thing was to sit through have my dinner with an empty iced tea glass and a waiter who never came back until we were so irritated we just wanted to pay up and get the hell out as soon as we could."}
{"text":"My birthday went out with a fizzle this year.  I waited all day anticipating dining here.  My brother-in-love made reservations and really talked it up.  What a disappointment.  There is so much disappointment I don't know where to start.  The waitress although friendly was somewhat clueless with helping with assistance with a girlie drink did direct my to talk to the bartender who wasn't any more helpful.  Although my sister and I ordered the same salad.  Hers was half the size of mine.  My prime rib that was supposed to be a rave was below subpar and cold.  I let my husband try it and said the same.  I really didn't want to be wrong.  I wondered why who ever delivered it walked quickly away and never looked back when I expressed a need.  My second prime rib they brought wasn't any better but by then I felt defeated.  And when you ask me for a choice of something please bring the correct choice I made.  I also ordered a glass of red wine and received it from another waiter after I had boxed up what I couldn't eat.  Which I left anyway it wasn't worth carting it home.  Then dessert.  Please don't put raspberry goo on a key lime pie.  I am tired of dining in this area and spending money when my husband and I can do better on our little weber grill.  And too bad you have to light a beautiful restaurant with a giant Budweiser sign.  Poor poor poor one star is too much"}
{"text":"Don't expect too much. Ordered the rib-eye and at best it was 1/8\" thick and was unseasoned and very fatty. Very bland as well. For 28.00 and such a nice place one would think they would have quality. Long Horn puts them to shame."}
{"text":"The restaurant takes up a converted movie theatre in downtown Gastonia. The atmosphere is good for both dining guests and bar patrons. I had the bisque and the bison meatloaf. The bisque was slightly above average but the meatloaf was fantastic. It's several meats mixed together and the flavor shines. Service was good as well. I'll definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, good food, good times, great wine list, relaxing atmosphere, and great environment.  Love the old feeling of being in the old theater and make new memories."}
{"text":"I think this has to be one of the best atmospheres in the area. Steaks are great, almost as good as mine. A jewel for Gastonia and downtown."}
{"text":"I will not be going back..I was trying to enjoy my $ 10.00 hamburger at the bar, but kept being aggravated by no less than 4 patrons who were very offensive. They were not eating, just drinking.   Management did not even attempt to contain the idiots."}
{"text":"Needed a place to eat on Xmas eve and this was the only local place I could find that was open. Tried the \"One Great Chicken Sandwich\" and it was completely tasteless. Maybe I just got them on a bad night."}
{"text":"Poor service. Our waitress seemed to forget about us. Steak was over cooked (medium instead of medium rare), burger was undercooked (pink meat, didn't specify a temp when ordering). Chef needs to learn to add salt to steak. Only reason it is not a 1 star is that the sides were excellent and the seafood was good.   Do not come here for red meat. Stick to the seafood.  Atmosphere was quite good. I expected much better from the initial greeting I got.  I won't be coming back anytime soon if ever."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my family to eat at Nicks on New Years Eve several days ahead for a 10:00 seating.....We literally were parking the car when we received a call from Nicks 10 minutes before our reservation time that they had basically RAN OUT OF MOST OF THEIR MENU ITEMS there were \"a few steaks\" or we could get a hamburger....Needless to say we had to try to find a place to eat at 10:00 last minute on NEW YEARS EVE....HOW  DO YOU RUN OUT OF FOOD AT A RESTAURANT ON NEW YEARS EVE!!!! Didn't even get an apology ...the manager didn't have the balls to call us himself....Thanks for destroying our New Year's Eve ...Will never go to Nicks again!"}
{"text":"A  bit of nostalgia downtown. Nicks Tap  house is a renovated theatre. From the old projector to the rounded arch of the screen area where they showed the pictures the beautiful balcony and the warm friendly atmosphere. We Werew allowed to walk around and take pictures. The food was perfect. Their cheeseburgers had a smoky flavor served on a potato roll with their seasoned fries. A perfect day! Good food good service and a great atmosphere. I'll definitely return ;)"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but the only thing consistent about Nicks is poor service and lukewarm to cold food."}
{"text":"Went there tonight - never again - service was slow (2 hours for dinner when the place isn't even half-full, are you kidding me).  Had the prime rib sandwich (sorry but $20+ for steak just doesn't fly, you can have the same steaks and probably higher quality at Long Horn or the like) and I honestly was amazed at how little I got, maybe 3 oz of meat, a bit of onion...and fries that looked like they were from walmart.  I can't justify $10 for something that left me hungry.  Another at our table had a burger ($9 or so) and said Red Robin is better.  Bottom line, go there if you like the type of place (old theater - kinda neet) but you're paying for the location not the food."}
{"text":"The building and atmosphere are super great and worth going to. They had good, live music but it was a little too loud. The waitress was not good- didn't check in often at all & we waited way too long for a simple order. The coffee was terrible (gave 2 cups a shot- tasted old). My food was at least good though- salmon goat cheese salad. I was surprised by how little salad there was and how much salmon- there was no toasted almonds like advertised but that's nit picking (but just something else to add to the list when it's been a sub par experience). I'll probably give it another shot though."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and overall was disappointed with the steak. Not a lot of flavor and garlic mash potatoes where just awful.  The shrimp appetizer was very good and the service was good, but I didn't come to this place for an appetizer.  Even at the cheaper price this place was not worth the money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I would have given Nick's 5 stars. The food amazing, the beer cold, the menu creative. But buyer beware. Be sure you review your check before handing over your credit card. Twice in one month I was way over charged. Two different servers. I was so bothered that I tried to contact the owner but they never returned my call or email.  I wanted to believe it was just an honest mistake but twice in one month and no return contact from the owner makes me think this is encouraged. Sad, because again, the food was great. But I won't go back."}
{"text":"tried this place for a second time,no luck this time again,went on a monday evening for the half price burger menu. ordered the fried green tomato burger with goat cheese, medium rare. burger came out burnt to a crisp,no fried green tomato but a nice red one.luckily the waiter knocked mine from the check but this was my last visit!"}
{"text":"Went there on a recent Thursday night, ordered a rib eye med well. Did not get a rib-eye like I ordered. Whatever the cut of meat, it was tough and not seasoned well . The mashed potatoes we not hot, barely warm and the salad nothing special. Was very disappointed as this was my first time eating there. The only way I would return would be to try one of the beers and maybe an appetizer and watch the movie screenings."}
{"text":"Was hoping Nick's would break the streak of mediocrity I've tasted since moving to the area. Menu looked great, reviews looked great, and prices were high enough that I thought it must be a diamond in the rough. And then...underwhelmed.  If you're seared at a regular table without an overhead light, download a flashlight app. Ambience is one thing, but I could barely read the menu.  Selections seemed to be on point but the food didn't follow through. I couldn't believe the portion size of my (slightly overcooked) salmon for the price. I've gotten more salmon on a salad.  I don't mean to say the place is a waste of time; it's just not worth $20-$30/plate. I enjoyed the location, and service was adequate, but I expect more from somewhere that charges that much.  Again, in a word: underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant.  We made our reservations via OpenTable and although a little late (9:30), and considering the fact that they close at 2am, I didn't expect to loud and dark karaoke bar....  I specifically added to my reservation that it was my boys 20th birthday, expecting some sort of fun for them, but nothing.  Not even a mention.    To start us out, we had to wait 10 minutes on a table.  When we arrived, we were the only people in the waiting area.  So much for reservations.  Also, we had to yell in normal conversation due to the music volume.  Even with that, we decided to continue and had to request a table upstairs where it was semi-quiet.  It was pretty obvious that we were there to eat and enjoy our night with the boys.  During the wait, a man who appeared to be wasted came out and was yelling at us to come in participate in the karaoke.  Really?  We finally get a table upstairs, only to learn on the way up  that we can't slide two tables together, due to fire rules...  No one was up there but us and sliding two tables together wouldn't hinder us getting out in case of fire.  Both sides of the table had 2-3 feet of space to walk.  So we had to sit at two separate tables.  Yay.  We start to order drinks and I decided to have a beer.  So I selected one from the beer menu, where I was told that they didn't have it and the manager pulled the menu from my hand and said.. \"Oh, this is an old menu and the beer I selected didn't even have a chance of coming back,  (giggle)\".  I asked what they had in the same style and she had no idea and went to ask.... 10 minutes later, I had an answer and ordered the alternative drink.    We then decided to order, and were told at this point that they were out of nearly everything.  We were reduced to pretty much the most expensive filet mignon and burgers.  Geeze, what a mistake to stay here.  We were then asked if we would like an appetizer, so we said sure!  We were then told that we have more bad news.  They can't make anything that requires flour.  OMG, seriously?  Sad situation.    The food was ok as for taste.  This place is a bit pricey.  We ended up with a $130 bill and 3 of 5 people had burgers and sodas for everyone but my one beer.  I can't recommend this place unless you just want to listen to music and get drunk with friends and whale on a karaoke mic.    Sorry Nick (or the owner).  I expected more, based on your elegant website and the experience it bolsters."}
{"text":"The only place I would return to for the food in Gastonia!  They are locally owned and this is a plus.  I like giving my business to locals.  They had the best service I have in a long time.  The customer service is awesome!  People really care about the quality of you experience at Nicks, they create a warm and friendly environment, The staff is attentive with out hovering.  The Manager stops at every table and checks in with patrons to see if they feel the restaurant is living up to what you expect and if it is not he will fix it  I love that they are doing the \"Nicks Feast\" for 30.00 every few months  you get an appetizer, entree and desert.  Not just cheap pasta side either  steaks that cost 21.00 on the regular menu are on the list of choices!  If you haven't been there or it's been awhile you should go back and have the best meal you can get in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Found Nick's on Yelp while driving to Charlotte. The last reviews were not complementary, but I hoped they were wrong. Nick's has a beautiful set up, so I thought it was promising. First issue, I asked for a $10 glass of red. Server brought it in a white glass. I spent the entire meal trying to gently spin it so it could open up. Server also never brought the water I asked for & never even asked if we wanted another beverage. Second issue: server had little comprehension of the menu & admitted she had never eaten the steak. It is a steakhouse! Third issue: server forgot to put in our appetizer. Salads came out first. Then she went into lengthy detail on why she forgot to enter our app.  Fourth issue: salads were tiny. We upgraded to fancier salads & they were still small.  Fifth issue: I ordered a $28 NY Strip. My husband ordered a $28 filet. My strip was horrible. It was a cut I expect from a generic grocery store & it had no flavor. Zero flavor. The filet was okay. Half of the sides were missing on my husband's plate. All the sides were cooked exactly the same with the same salty flavor.  I wish I had believed the reviews I read. Some people are hard to please, but I'm not one of those people. We dropped $100 on a dinner that was worth $25.  Pros: crab cake was good. Cons: everything else If you try Nick's, I hope you have a better experience than we did, but be warned."}
{"text":"Had a really enjoyable dinner at Nick's. Found it on Yelp on the way back to Charlotte after a LONG day out, and I'd put the experience at about a 90/100. When I have a really positive experience somewhere and there are some not-great reviews, I always wonder what the issue was. It sounds like Nick's has (or had) some issues with running out of stuff and with service; neither of those were the case here. Service was top-notch. Granted, it was REALLY slow (I think we were one of 3 parties dining in the restaurant, and a couple more in the bar), but sometimes that can make things worse as the server says \"Oh, I can just do my side-work while it's slow\". Not the case here. Our waiter was great, helpful, and accommodating. Contrary to what was posted in another review, no problem sliding a couple of tables together to make sure we had enough room. When we had a spilled drink, there was a veritable pit-crew response to get things cleared up and our dinner back on-track. There was one low point, food-wise: The calamari. And it wasn't terrible, I've certainly had worse. The flavor was good. But it was a little overdone (and thus chewy) and the breading wouldn't survive the dip that came with it (so you dip the calamari and come out with no dip and an unbreaded bit of squid - no good.  I only mention that because that slight \"whiff\" was the only misstep in an excellent meal. The chicken tenders were moist inside, crisp outside, and definitely prepared fresh for us. These were fresh and delicious. I had the meatloaf, which was delicious; also in the party were filet (perfectly prepared) and a burger (also excellent). The bacon-gorgonzola potato cakes were as mouth-wateringly good as they sound. And the salads were a surprsing high point. Where in other places, the salad is a lifeless bowl of crisp-but-flavorless lettuce, this salad actually tasted like ... salad. And the green goddess dressing: Amazing! Wanted to try the desserts but absolutely ran out of room."}
{"text":"My first time and i was impressed. The atmosphere was way cool and contemporary. I had the artichoke, shrimp, crab dip. A little watery but delicious.  Entree was one of best shrimp and fried grits I've ever had.  Corn muffins have just a hint of jalapeño. Yummmmm! Everything was great including service.    Look at back of menu for 30pp special.. was a great deal!"}
{"text":"Awesome renovated theater building keeps the atmosphere casual and fun.  When you come, try the bacon Bleu cheese chips!  Great steak.  Good service."}
{"text":"We love Nick's!  I have not experienced bad service there yet like some of the other reviewers, and this is one of the only places to go in Gastonia that has a fun / different atmosphere.  I usually get their shrimp and grits (so delish) and my husband almost always gets the bison meatloaf - his fave!    I have also ordered the iceberg wedge which has great additional ingredients too, and that paired with my entree was way more than I was able to eat. I think the prices are totally reasonable for what you get, too. This isn't eating at any other typical Gastonia steakhouse chain, thankfully."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice and neither time was good.  This time I tried their Restaurant week and it was a total rip and also not great tasting.  The NY Strip was so peppery its was inedible, the Ribeye was cut so thin and so overdone that I cannot believe a chef even sent it out, the mashed potatos were bland, and the chocolate cake was a give or take.  Will not be visiting this place again, much better places that give you for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Had our family Christmas there last night. Service was great! Food was excellent. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because my steak was over cooked. It still tasted delicious just not how I normally like it. The rest of my family enjoyed their meals and drinks. The restaurant even accommodated us by changing to the Michigan State basketball game. Our server was Alex, he was very kind and attentive. Definitely would go again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"We had fried calamari appetizer which was lukewarm, rubbery and greasy. .  We had NY Strip and Rib eye..the NY strip which I ordered medium was very chewy.  My husband ordered Ribeye which was bland and very fatty.  The sea food my Mom ordered was so greasy..certainly not worth the money.  The plus side was the waiter was very nice and the idea of it being in an old theater was charming   It stops there"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the entire experience. Nice movie theater theme.  Service was outstanding, fast; never let our drinks go below the halfway mark.  Food was steak was cooked just right along with the portions a nice size.  Excellent find well worth the drive, a must to try for Charlotte Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"Upside - great service , good pour ,  fine selection   Downside - while my partners meatloaf was excellent ( her words) , felt a lil disappointed by my steak . I felt I deserved a better cut than the meat I was served . Wasn't great wasn't bad - just meh . Too bad too - was really looking for some great local flavor"}
{"text":"Filet was just okay. Ordered medium rare and they cooked it spot on! Steak was juicy but somehow a little tough. Maybe it was the grade of beef, not sure. I decided to try the steak as listed on the menu which comes topped with pimento cheese. Personally I did not care for it on the steak and instead mixed it with my mashed potatoes. I tasted the potatoes before mixing in the cheese and they were slightly cold and tasted like boxed potatoes or leftovers. Vegetables were medley and also tasted bland like they were frozen. The only menu items that I thought were outstanding were the firecracker shrimp which I highly recommend and the burgers! Burger was juicy and had great flavor! Atmosphere was cool and a great looking bar. Service was excellent even though their are mixed reviews online regarding service. Overall experience was just okay."}
{"text":"Kudos to Nick's for bringing some much needed character/class to an area overflowing with chains and fast food.   The restaurant itself is in a historic old movie theater that has been converted into a very nice space with seating, a bar and an open kitchen. A huge projector screen remains and there are usually older classic films playing which creates a nice ambiance for dining. The food is great. The menu offers some really delicious choices. Above average appetizers, creative burgers, fresh salads with really good homemade dressing, steaks and prime rib etc. Everything i have tried has been impressive. So impressive that id still eat here if they didn't offer amazing specials like:  Half price apps 5-7 everyday. (This is how ive sampled most of the appetizer menu) Half price burgers every Mon. $12.99 prime rib dinner on Sundays. Bogo apps all day Tuesday. Half prices entrees for your entire birthday month. Various $3 draft specials.  Wednesday night is movie night featuring a film and free popcorn.  These specials just mean i can go more often:) . I like to visit on Sundays and get the prime rib  and a half priced appetizer or two. I always leave very full and happy. I cant say enough good things about this place. There is nothing else like Nick's in town. Not even in Charlotte. Overall the concept, the food, the adorableness of the old theater makes this a total win on every level.  If your in the area, skip the chains and go to Nick's you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"The worst meal and service I have received in a very long time and I eat out a lot.  The food was awful, the service was slow.  We had no appetizer plates or dinner utensils.  The food was way undercooked and vegetables came out of a can.  I will not go back.  It was also very hot and humid.  The waitstaff clearly hated their jobs."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food at Nick's is very good and the atmosphere is unique and fun. Nick's has the potential to be an incredible restaurant, but it does not seem to be able to live up to that potential. I wanted to like this place so badly, because of the history behind it, but was left desiring more.   There is no skirting around it; the problem with this place is the service. Now let me start by saying that we went here for dinner during Restaurant week, so they were overwhelmed with the flood of people that accompanies that. With this in mind, I made sure to make a reservation. I made a reservation for 7:15, and they acted as if this wouldn't be an issue at all. My girlfriend and I were not seated until 7:45, and we did not see our waitress for another 10 minutes on top of that. All in all, the dinner ended up being almost a 2 hour ordeal. The server seemed disinterested and distracted (again may have been a result of restaurant week).   Now that the glaring problem with Nick's has been addressed, lets move onto the food.  My girlfriend and I both decided to do the three course Restaurant week deal. For the appetizer we collectively decided to get the Famous Firecracker Shrimp and the Crab Cake. Both were very good. The crab cake was full of crab meat and had a nice crisp exterior. Could have used a little tartar sauce on the side, but that is personal preference. The Firecracker Shrimp were also good. They were nicely breaded and had a tangy sauce drizzled on top. For our main course we both quickly settled on \"The Best Filet Mignon Anywhere.\" This was definitely the highlight of the three courses. My steak was cooked perfectly medium as I had asked. Very tender and juicy. The Filet is topped with pimento cheese, which may seem like an odd combo, but they actually work well together. For dessert we tried the cheesecake, which was forgettable. Overall the food was very good.   The best part of Nick's is by far the atmosphere. It is located in an old movie theatre that has been a part of the landscape of downtown Gastonia for years. It still has the old marquis that used to show all of the movies that would be playing on a Friday night. It really takes you back and catches the eye at night. When you enter, one of the first things that you notice is an old camera in the corner. This place is filled with old memorabilia. There are old movie posters on the wall of some classics, including Cool Hand Luke, North by Northwest, and Psycho. The second thing that you notice is the screen on the back wall of the restaurant. They are constantly playing a classic film in the background. It was so cool glancing up in between bites and seeing Jimmy Stewart in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" The place is beautiful with high arched ceilings. It definitely has a lot of character.   If you go to Nick's, expect spotty service. Keep in mind that I went on restaurant week, but have heard from many Gastonia natives that this is the norm for Nick's.   If you aren't in a hurry, Nick's really is worth trying, despite the service. The place has a great atmosphere and very good food. This is a good spot for a movie loving carnivore. I hope that Nick's gets its act together and brings it service up to par with its food and atmosphere. This place really could be a gem in downtown Gastonia."}
{"text":"Went to Nick's last night.  The atmosphere was great.  It is really nice they were able to incorporate the original Webb Theater into the design of the restaurant. The server was knowledgable and friendly. Good beer selection, several on tap. I ordered the filet which was broiled and cooked just as I had ordered. One of the better steaks I have had and about $10 - $15 cheaper than the steak houses in Charlotte. Awesome wedge salad as well. I would recommend trying Nick's if you are in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Great place for a night out. The staff is typically friendly and the steaks are good. The beer selection is ok with a fair amount of craft beers on tap. From here you can visit many other local establishments and coffee place."}
{"text":"These people do not know how to run a business. Probably better off going to McDonald's for dinner"}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and we came here for restaurant week. Even though we made a reservation, they were not prepared. We had to wait 20 minutes past our reserved time for people to leave so they could push the tables together.   The atmosphere is unique and the history is cool but the food is inconsistent and some of it is not as they describe in the menu. However, it's hard to tell if this place is intended for patrons to have a nice dining experience or if its a bar.  Several of us ordered the ribeye, and while most were decent, one in particular was a poor cut of meat and thinner than the others. It was over cooked and the blue cheese sauce was minimal on all cuts.   The filet was delicious and the pimento cheese was an excellent addition.  The flounder was good but not tender.   The sides were sub par. The mashed potatoes consistency were comparable to a school cafeteria however the flavor was good. The Mac and cheese was essentially noodles with some melted cheese lacking flavor. The squash was disappointing.  It was nice to try something outside of the traditional restaurant week, but I'm not sure if it was good enough to return."}
{"text":"We live in Belmont and decided to try this place out vs. our downtown steakhouse. SO glad we did!! Great spot for our anniversary dinner. It is a great space, in a remodeled movie theatre with a projection screen playing classics. Open kitchen view beneath the screen. Food came in a timely manner, every time I was finished with a plate, another came shortly after! Their homemade dressings and the (herb/garlic?) butter were amazing. Our waitress was attentive but was polite not to interrupt our conversation at times. The only thing I'd change next time would be sitting in a booth.... The top of the table was a bit wiggly, maybe not that sturdy of a base! We will definitely return for their awesome drink, food and movie specials. Oh, and we got to keep a clean pint glass with the beer of the month purchase!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, Starvin' like Marvin and wanting a good beer. What's that Yelp? Someone turned a movie theater into a steakhouse? Sounds good. Open the door and step in a great building refurb. Make your way past the bar and the place opens right up to a dining area, open kitchen and movies being played on a theater size screen. Want to visit the balcony? The main entry has staircases on either side which lead to a banquet like dining room, seating area and then two more tiers of seating that overlook the open kitchen (be careful not to fall into the deep fryer). The Beer:  someone really thought out the beer selections - Red Oak, OMB Copper and Mecktoberfest, Unknown Tele-Porter and Pumpking for starters. The Food: Classic Steakhouse Burger with pimento cheese and applewood bacon - fries with gravy. Delicious!! They grind steak in house to make their burgers. Great flavor. The fries were a bit salty but the gravy toned them down. The Service: Quick and friendly. We sat at the bar (to be closer to the beer of course). A solid four star experience for me. Can't speak for service and food availability (from other reviews) when they are in full swing, but my lunch experience was great. Cool place for a party or reception!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, and great atmosphere. Both my boyfriend and I ordered burgers which were cooked to perfection. No complaints about this place... And I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome place...  I had the burger lunch and it was on up there with the best burger I ever had and the fries with brown gravy on the side are delicious.   If you like craft beer you're going to be happy too... Decent selection."}
{"text":"The best part of Nick's is it's location. Nick's is in a former theater in downtown Gastonia. Structural elements of the theater remain which enhance the mood of the restaurant. Above the bar is a large TV on which vintage films are shown. My choice for lunch was the buffalo chicken Cobb salad. I have had better Cobb salads but it was filling and \"A-OK.\" My friend had the firecracker shrimp salad - that's what he always gets when he goes there - he loves it so much!"}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about shocking. Excellent atmosphere.  On point service.  Delicious dinner.  The only thing we had to complain about was the sliding table.  Big city quality in the middle of downtown Gastonia. A little out of the way but worth it!  Calamari..wonderful flavor, nice and tender.  Blue cheese dressing..top quality,  wanted more so that I could dunk my bread in it.  Ribeye..slightly undercooked..herb butter was an EXCELLENT complainment.  I rather have my steak undercooked than over cooked. NOT by much. Dessert...to die for. Not a huge selection but was good quality.    Previous commet mentioned slow service. They must of took it to heart because we had excellent service. The flavor of the steak was better than what we had a Ruth's Chris.    Was a wonderful relaxing meal.  Hope they hang in there it is worth the trip to downtown!!!"}
{"text":"We've now been three separate times. Each time the service has been exceptionally slow. We are never offered bread even though I see other random tables getting it. This last time takes the cake though. Our waitress was so slow and hardly checked in with us. She took our drink order only to come back almost five minutes later to tell us they were \"washing glasses\" and it would be a few minutes. Ok, I appreciated that but why did it take so long to tell us?  Then, instead of taking our order she left. When she came back with drinks finally took our order. Another staff member brought my salad and literally just dropped it in front of me and left. Well, silverware would have been nice too but apparently that was too much to ask. It was over five minutes before I saw our waitress and finally got silverware. When she resurfaced sometime later it was to tell us that our order was entered after a large party so it would be a bit before our food came out. Nice. If she had taken our order earlier like she was supposed to, that wouldn't have been an issue. Finally got our meal after 40 minutes. It wasn't even good. Got our check, paid cash and asked for change. I gave her $60 for a $53 bill. She gave me $10 back. Really???  So I left the $3 since it didn't belong to us and got out of there. We will NEVER go back. Every staff member we encountered had little interest in actually doing anything. I don't know why people go there."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a party with friends. The bar and wait staff were friendly and hard-working, but the kitchen product was an unprofessional shambles. When ordering, the most popular choices on the menu were unavailable. My wife chose penne pasta, but that eventually turned out to be unavailable also (what restaurant runs out of pasta?). She then switched to flounder, but that turned out to be unavailable also, and finally chose tilapia, which arrived after long delays with the consistency of cardboard - completely inedible. My NY strip steak was decent (if over-salted, and a thin cut for a steakhouse), but the baked potato was tiny and completely dried out. Several other diners had similar complaints, and one returned a pasta dish as inedible. Many found their dishes way over-spiced/over-salted. Basically the only item no-one complained about was the salads. I do not think that more than half of our group was really satisfied with its meal. Too bad, since the ambiance in an old movie house is great. Bottom line: go to the bar for a drink if you like, but stay away from the food!"}
{"text":"Great!  Service was great, food was awesome, atmosphere was perfect...I had the prime rib and my wife had the filet, both were cooked to perfection.  We tried the mushroom appetizer, we thought it was great....Not sure why this place is getting such bad reviews, we were there on Friday night, place was busy and service was top notch... We will definitely be revisiting."}
{"text":"An oasis in this town, one of the few truly great places to eat with character. Surprised to see any bad reviews on here; probably competitors."}
{"text":"Ran across Nicks, Nice atmosphere, different for Gastonia. Had a wedge salad and the bone-in ribeye. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"While the waitstaff was friendly and the ambience appealing, there were the same problems encountered when it first opened.  They were out of most of their menu.  We waited 20 minutes before we saw any waiter to get us another drink.  When they finally brought our sad, sad salad, our entrees came before we got a few bites. I got the New York Strip.  It was 1/4 of an inch thick, overly salted and certainly not worth the cost.  If you want some wings, a drink and a place to chat, this is your place.  If you want good food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner on Valentine's Day, and had one of the worst dining experiences of our lives. After a \"20 minute wait\" turned into 45, we were finally seated in a small room upstairs with 4 other tables. It took almost 20 minutes just to get drinks and menus, at which point we were told that the restaurant was out of most of the menu items. We both ordered the ribeye, my wife got hers with a salad, and I ordered the crab-stuffed mushrooms. Another 20 minutes passed, and the waitress came back to tell me that they were out of mushrooms and that someone was running to the store to buy more, but that they would be happy to substitute the Firecracker Shrimp instead. The shrimp were actually pretty good, but they turned out to be the highlight of the evening...45 minutes after finishing our salad and appetizer, we still hadn't seen our entrees, and none of the waitresses would even look in our direction. Eventually, one of them came to the table and informed us that our ticket had been \"lost\" and that the restaurant was now completely out of steaks. Total time spent waiting...2 hours and 15 minutes, only to leave hungry and very annoyed, left to try and find somewhere to eat at 10:30 PM on Valentine's Day. All I can say is, thank god for Denny's. Of the 5 tables in the room we were seated in, all of them had at least one problem with their order, and 2 of them got up and left in the middle of the meal, proving that our experience was not an isolated incident. We will not be returning."}
