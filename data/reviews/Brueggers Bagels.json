{"text":"i've been here on several occasions. friendly staff and fresh bagels. i went used the drive through yesterday morning and they gave me my bagel in a jiffy. fast service!!

the only thing about bagel joints is that they practically slather a pound of cream cheese on your bagel no matter if you go here or Einstein's... one bad this about this place is that every time i get a half dozen bagels i get charge a totally different prices (on 3 occasions) what's up with that? at least keep a consistent price on your bagels. ugh!!

i still love this place though... i especially love cinnamon-sugar bagel, it's got that caramelize sugar on there and when you take a bite it'll crackle. it's pure goodness."}
{"text":"If Einstein Bros is the benchmark at 3 stars, then Bruegger's barely earns 2 stars.

Customer service is mediocre. Only one gal (who I've seen a few times) actually smiles, makes eye contact, and seems pleased to be working here. Everyone else acts inconvenienced that I am there.

If you order a simple bagel w/cream cheese, you will be O.K. They are not bad, but nothing special. If you order a bagel sandwich, be sure to bring a towel as they leak a lot and turn soggy after a few minutes.

Coffee is O.K., but nothing special. 

Store cleanliness? It could be better. The beverage counter (with the lids and coffee creamers etc.) is often messy and sticky. 

I noticed that there is a duplicate entry for this location, so I'm pasting this review on the other as well."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not sure how people have not had a great experience at Brueggers! Originally I am from Michigan, and there is a Brueggers right down the street from my house. That being said, I went there a lot! Then, I moved out to Phoenix and I found that the nearest Brueggers to me is actually quite far. Thats my only complaint. Its not close enough. Everytime I go, the staff is very accomodating and super friendly. All of their bagels and cream cheese are freshly made, and they have product for sale as well. I honestly have never had a problem at Brueggers, and I am surprised that other people have!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Camelback corrider, Brueggers!    Good coffee, fast service, hot bagels.  

It's not New York-style bagels.   It doesn't have the shmoozy ambience of the Starbucks that previously inhabited the same spot.    I would not drive miles to get there.   But if you live and/or work in the neighborhood, Brueggers is an easy place to grab a bagel or a sandwich.   There is nothing like it close by.   

It is not gourmet, but it does what it does well.   For neighbors, a dependable place to add to the rotation.    For office workers, no need to cross the street for something quick and tasty to eat.  Ya gotta love that!"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I am glad to have it.  I don't have much to say about the food, it is typical.  The coffee is good (better than Starbucks IMO) but Sweet-n-Low would be a nice addition.

My complaint about this place is the service.  The service is extremely slow, mentally and physically.

On my last visit, I ordered a breakfast sandwich (menu says egg and cheese on a bagel) with sausage on a sesame bagel.  She turned, distracted by another customer's order, and then turned back and asked \"What kind of bagel?\".  Then when making the sandwich asked \"Do you want egg on that?\" (egg is PART of the breakfast bagel sandwich!!!)  Once the egg was warmed (2-minute process finding egg patties in the refrigerator, walking them to the microwave, working on another customer's order), she proceeded to make and wrap the sandwich WITHOUT sausage.  In the interim, she was busy trying to complete several other orders.  A simple bagel sandwich took almost 8 minutes from order to checkout, and I was 2nd in line. It also took me repeating order items or coaching the server 3 times.

This was not a one-time deal.  I frequent this place for breakfast and the service is always EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW.  During breakfast hours, they usually don't have the eggs warmed!  They mess up on the contents of the sandwich and wrap items even with the menu hanging right over their heads!  They do not listen well to customer orders resulting in having to repeat order items at least once and usually more.

It does not matter who the server is, they never get my order right on the first try, seem to be confused by my order (straight off the menu) and take FOREVER to put it together.

The help needs to be trained in several things...

1) Better knowledge of the menu.
2) Keeping all necessary preparation items fully stocked.
3) LISTENING to the customer's order.
4) Better multi-task skills OR focus on ONLY ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME.

They seem to try to make up for higher customer demand times by working on (and messing up) multiple orders at a time.  They should just focus on listening and then rapidly and properly completing one customer's order at a time."}
{"text":"Bugger Bagels. That's gross right? But that's what I call this Bruegger's on AZ Ave. This is going to sound super mean, but everything about this place is gross- like gag me with a spoon gross. The kitchen isn't clean, the tables are never bussed and the bagels are always a little crunchy and I can't tell you how many times I've seen the staff here handle food without gloves.

Exhale. Ok, I feel better."}
{"text":"My overall review for this location of Brueggers is 1-star. But, I must say... when you ACTUALLY get what you ordered, the food is quite good. I prefer Brueggers over Einstein's any day. The bagels are softer and I enjoy their flavors better. 

But, one can only describe a trip to the Brueggers at 24th and Camelback as either a trip to the Twilight Zone, an episode of Candid Camera or a stint on Punk'd (or a combination of all of the above). The employees are friendly enough, and it seems to be locally owned and operated, but the employees are slow, inept and downright stuipd. I hate to call anyone stupid, but there really is no other explanation. You must repeat even the simplest of orders at least three-four times and only order one item or sandwich at a time. No matter what type of bagel you ask for, they grab a different one and you have to nicely inform them once again of the kind you wanted. If you ask for no cheese on the sandwich, they put it on any way. Ask for bacon? You get sausage. It's really that bad.

One trip, I ordered two sandwiches. Knowing their level of service, I ordered SLOWLY and asked for one sandwich at a time. The employee asked me three times what type of bagel, four times if I wanted it toasted and still got it wrong. I seriously felt I was on MTV's Boiling Points.

My last three visits, I brought the food home only to find the order was wrong.

Today, I ordered two bagel sandwiches. One was correct, the other was totally wrong, after reminding the employee three times of what I wanted (and after stopping him from grabbing the wrong bagel).

I live nearby, its a convenient location and the food is good. The service SUCKS.

I typically go on the weekends, but I have friends that work in the building, and they have had similar experiences during the week and have stopped going.

You have to experience this for yourself. Words seriously can't describe."}
{"text":"I found the employees very pleasant, and the restaurant was very clean. My breakfast bagel was delicious, hot, and fresh.

The only negative I've found about this place is the parking is a bit scant. It's not your normal parking lot. But parking in the garage is free for their customers."}
{"text":"I'm from NY. I'm a snob  when it comes to bagels, cheesecake and pizza. Thats not to say all pizza, cheesecake and bagels are good in NY. There are places there that suck., I'm still looking for cheesecake. Brueggers is excellent. Ask which ones are just out of the oven and get them whatever kind they are. O I found good pizza a Famous Ray's but ONLY the one on 7th and whatever Frank Lloyd Wright becomes on the west side"}
{"text":"I'm in the Phoenix area about twice a month and I always stop at Bruegger's to try something new off their menu. I'm never disappointed & its worth the couple extra bucks to not be eating drive thru processed food and the cookies are always fresh and yummy!
I'm loving the new staff and how welcoming they make the shop!!!"}
{"text":"This started off badly, but, the way it was handled was top notch. Usually the food is great but this morning I ordered a Tuna Salad on an onion bagel. The tuna was really bad, it tasted like it had turned and as I said before, the food is usually great. The reason this is so positive is, the manager actually was extremely concerned about it and had her employee throw it away immediately. She not only refunded that sandwich, but, she refunded the entire order and gave me a large soda, she even offered to buy me another sandwich!!! I wish more businesses handled themselves like this person did. I'll always go back!! Top notch service!!!! Way to go Brueggers, please give her a raise!!!"}
{"text":"I have noticed that most of the reviews were not particularly about the bagels, but rather their bagel sandwiches.  I have never had one of their sandwiches in the 5 plus years I have been frequenting Bruegger's.  I instead just purchase bagels, a bakers dozen (13) at a time about 3 times a month, my favorites being onion, sesame, poppyseed and everything.  You need to know that I grew up in NYC, and at one time my father managed a bagel bakery, I KNOW good bagels!  The service is commendable, I can call a half hour ahead and they will fresh bake my bagels if they don't 13 available at the time.  I have tried most of the other bagel places and feel that Bruegger's are still the best.  On Wednesdays they give you $2 off on a dozen!!!"}
{"text":"How is it possible that a bagel shop runs out of nearly every bagel at 9:30 in the morning?!?  One would think that there would be new batches of each flavor ready to go when a flavor runs out.  That's called good business!!  I was forced to settle for flavors I did not want and will now go the extra distance to Einstein's when I have a craving for a bagel and cream cheese.  This is honestly the first and only time I have visited a bagel shop for breakfast only to see that they were out of nearly every flavor of bagel!  What a joke, lost a customer."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed, and somewhat insulted. 

Went there for breakfast Sunday, 9/26, at 8:20am. Granted this location is in the 'business' area of Scottsdale, there weren't many people out and about, there was a Brueggers employee on the corner with a sign, encouraging people to come in for breakfast. There were 4 employees (within sight) when we walked in - there were no other customers in the store, although 2 were outside. We were greeted by one employee, from across the store, and while I waited about 10 minutes for the lone bagel-maker-guy to make 3 toasted bagels w/cream cheese for my friend, NO ONE came out to help (take my order). Another employee, came in and out of the dining area - he was really focused on wiping the Coke machine (it did NOT look dirty, it was clean, as was the rest of the store). But this other employee either just stood at the cash register, staring out the window, or . . . finding something to do while I waited for the lone bagel-maker-guy to take my order - which was 2 toasted bagels, 1 w/cream cheese, the other w/lox, etc.). By the time I got my 2 bagels, my friend was completely done with his 3 bagels, so we left (so much for eating out together). During the time (15 minutes) I waited for my 2 bagels (and probably would have been quicker if the employee had simply turned up the toaster heat, and slowed the conveyor so the bagel would actually toast - rather than put it back through FOUR TIMES) I saw 3 other employees who did NOTHING to help the one person behind the counter. When I constructively expressed my frustration to the cashier (who turned out to be the manager - I forget her name), she told me she was \"doing inventory\", and responded \"I was not aware of the situation\", to which I replied, 'yeah, that's how it goes' (like, hello????? OBVIOUSLY you were not aware.

Look, I have about 15 years restaurant, and retail management experience, for companies that lead in customer service . . . and for a national chain, Bruegger's fails miserably. As a business, you NEVER sacrifice customer service when doing inventory, and you train your employees to MULTITASK. If there's anyone waiting, and you are able, HELP your co-worker(s). This was one of the worst experiences, and poorest examples of customer service I've seen in a very long time."}
{"text":"Great Quality and thought it was a very tasty! Had a jalapeño bagel, sausage, jalapeño cream cheese and was delish!"}
{"text":"Yowza! Where to begin...first of all, we've driven past this place hundreds of times...and now we know why! Only reason we went in is because we had a coupon (they seem to hate coupons as employees). 
The service was horrendous! Totally rude and rather expensive for a bagel joint. It seems as though the only qualification to work here is the ability to come in at 5:30am. 
Egg and sausage are pre-made and are nuked for breakfast bagels.
As we were sitting in the restaurant (which was dirty), we noticed that the drive-thru wait was at least 6 minutes per person. Definitely not worth the wait. 
Needless to say, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"They do not respect our flag!!! A business should have more respect for our country and address issues like this."}
{"text":"I had always wondered this place, as it is relatively close to where I live. And after once visit, I think I'm going to keep on coming here. 

As it was my first time, I didn't really know how to order, what to get, and what they had to offer. The staff kindly explained what kind of sandwiches and bagels they had. And the atmosphere was very casual, in a good way. 

My sandwich was delicious, and they made me a pretty dang good latte. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Just went to this location yesterday and they are closed. After contacting the corporate office. I was informed that this location is closed and no reason was given. 

so sad. Their are no more Brueggers in the phoenix area. :("}
{"text":"FOOD: I ordered the Spinach Cheddar omelette on a toasted tomato bagel. The bagel was rubbery, and they left off the cheddar. The spinach was low-quality. SERVICE: They were nice enough, but they gave me wrong information. I explicitly asked if there were any restrictions on the validation of parking, and I was told, \"No.\" Yet, when I left the parking building, the attendant informed me they only validate for one hour...which was only $3 of my now $8 parking bill. She indicated the misunderstanding was a regular occurrence.

UPDATE: I contacted the corporate office because I really was not happy with the poor quality food, omission of an item which is right in the name of the food (cheddar), and getting stuck with an unexpected $5 parking fee. They sent me a voucher for $5 off any meal at Bruegger's. It's been approximately one year, and I still haven't used it (primarily because of their inconvenient hours and locations). However, I appreciated the gesture, and thought they should receive recognition for that."}
{"text":"Worst experience for a first timer, which just made me a last timer. I will never go back to this place. They couldn't get any of my orders right. I ordered 2 Salmon sandwiches, ended up with only one, but was charged for 2. Then I thought a coffee sounded good, they got one of them but forgot mine, so after I reminded them, they couldn't grasp what a blended decaf peppermint mocha was. Once I tasted it I sent it right back and asked for my $ back. I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"I use Brueggers as a quick place to grab a bagel or at lunchtime a cup of soup. The employees greet you with a smile, and are extremely pleasant.  The chicken tortilla soup is nice, and has a little bit of a kick to it. I wish they had a few other things, like yogurt to go along with the bagel sandwiches in the morning."}
{"text":"Bruegger's is down the street from my office so I wanted to like it but that didn't happen on my first visit.

I stopped in at 7:30am on weekday and ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese. For some reason this took about five minutes which seemed like a long time since no one else was there. The guy who took my order started it but then attended to two other people who came in after me and I was left wondering who would give me my bagel. After picking up an OJ cup I finally asked for my bagel and he said, \"Oh yeah, it's coming\".

The whole experience was awkward and drawn out to the point where my first visit to Bruegger's will be my last. :/"}
{"text":"Your service SUCKS and is s-l-o-w
Why don't you drink a cup of Joe?
Or just do a line of blow?

To help with the logistics
Preparation of bagels should be quite simplistic
Or maybe I'm being too realistic?

Good thing your \"breakfast bagel\" is delicious!
Employees snicker, \"Oh she was merely being capricious.\"
Add some bacon for THE meal that's most nutritious

Surprisingly, your coffee was pretty strong
I really don't want to complain for too long
Wish this was a more upbeat song

So hopefully you'll get your sh*t together 
All doubts gone forever

And say never, ever, ever
Be stuck going to Einstein's even though your bagels are better"}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning for a bagel.  I was promplty greeted, and served, and they had a full stock of all the bagels. 

I ordered a garlic bagel because I love garlic, and the added bonus of stinking all day keeps people from getting to close to ask me stupid questions.  It was toasted perfectly, and and the creme cheese to bagel ratio was perfect.  

The bagel itself was on the small side, smaller than the ones at Einsteins.  While part of me views this as a negative, it's a much closer size to the \"right\" size bagel for health reasons.  The downside was that it wasn't enough to fill me up, and I ended up getting a second.

The store itself was clean, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and the staff was friendly, polite and professional.

The rating would be higher, except, faced with the rush hour drive to work with 2 bagels and some cherry coke in my tummy, I decided to avail myself of the ladies facility.  

This is where it all went TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY wrong.  First, they have a one room ladies, no stalls, which could lead to waits, and god help you if the woman before you is a disgusting pig.  I'm not sure, I never made it as far as the porcelain throne.  As soon as I had closed the door behind me, the smell assaulted me like the storming of the beaches of Normandy.  It smelled like they had used dirty water with a splash of bleach to clean, and that smell permeated the enter room.  My cat like reflexes that pulled my shirt up over my nose were not enough - bagels were rising, and the urge to upchuck was terrible.  I stumbled out of the room looking like a sorority girl leaving an all boys dorm at the end of hell week.  After a few minutes of heavy breathing of fresh Phoenix smog outside, I was composed enough to resolve to drive to work."}
{"text":"I work in the building, so grabbing a quick lunch is convenient.  however, each time I get sucked back in -I regret it.  
I went in today for and ordered a BLT- $8.50 w a drink and chips

Since I'm still hungry, i will find a real value in the vending machines
I need a shock collar to prevent my return in the future"}
{"text":"Ugh. How frustrating is it to have to repeat yourself several times to get them to understand what you're ordering? ...And then they still don't get it right? This has happened to me 2 of 2 trips there (and I won't be back). My advice: train some active listening skills."}
{"text":"I only went to this place because it was part of a Groupon deal and after reading reviews I thought \"everyone has their own experiences I'll give this a chance.\" If I did not have the $7.00 for $15.00 worth I would have been EXTREMELY disappointed and felt I might as well thrown the 15.00 out the window for someone to find.


The bagels were very salty tasting and hard. The service was extremely slow at 10:00am. When asked for \"no tomatoes\" they were included. Overall, you might as well save your money and go to Einstein's for their breakfast bagels, or to Dunkin' Doughnuts. I would not go back there again."}
{"text":"Having lived on the East Coast, I loved seeing Brueggers in Phoenix. Their cinnamon sugar bagels are to die for and their customer service rocked when I went in!

The parking at this location is the only down side but personally, I'll park at Biltmore and walk over (just easier for me). This is a refreshing addition to the area--hope it lasts because the signage isn't exactly obvious!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I pick up breakfast from here, and it's usually pretty good. I typically order either a cinnamon sugar bagel with strawberry cream cheese, or a blueberry one with strawberry cream cheese. The cream cheese is very tasty, and so are the bagels, but they're kind of hard. They're very tough to rip and chew. That's really the only thing wrong with this place though."}
{"text":"Okay I previously praised this place as the god of bagel joints and although I still say they have the best bagels in Arizona...I THINK THIS IS NOTEWORTHY!

I came here early one Saturday morning with my boyfriend for some breakfast. I ordered my favorite...rosemary bagel mmmmm.

We get home and I take a bite of this golden delicacy only to discover that the inside was slightly doughy and uncooked. It was so delicious that I ate it despite this disgusting fact and paid for it the rest of the day.

Only one place can make me want to eat doughy uncooked bagels and that's Brueggers but uh yeah seriously cook your stuff before serving me. I'm a huge fan don't abuse me like this again. :{"}
{"text":"I love BB!!! Grew up on it in the Midwest. Love the bacon scallion cc on an everything bagel. I also really like the onion & chive cc on a salt bagel. They have great iced tea. Their location is not ideal bc parking is limited."}
{"text":"BRUEGGER'S BAGELS on Arizona Avenue and Guadalupe has got to be the best bagel shop around. I go there about 2 or 3 times a week. The bagels are far waaaay better than Einsteins. You cannot compare. I love their Western egg sandwich. Lots of goodies on that sandwich. The store is always clean and let me tell you the bathrooms are Super clean!!!! The staff are super efficient and always warm and inviting. They 
persuaded me to try lunch and I sure did. WOW the sandwiches are HUGE!!! and they come with a pickle, and a cookie. My favorites sandwich is the turkey chipotle club. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  For those of you who havent been or  have been in the past please go!!!  It has been under new management for a little over a year. Definately a great experience."}
{"text":"Not many chains sell salt bagels anymore, so I'm very happy about that. Service has always been fine on my visits and the breakfast bagel sandwich is tasty.

LOOK OUT for the skank that is a regular there and will almost knock you down to get into the place before you. She'll then order her \"regular\" with her flippant attitude (blueberry bagel with butter, but \"LIGHTLY toasted, just a LITTLE brown\"). Then her and her nebbish husband will take the biggest table in the place and spread newspapers all over it and she will read hairstyle magazines.

OH, she'll also completely trash the drink station with her obvious inability to do anything for herself. Ugh. Makes we want to vomit even writing about her."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm a Jew from New York. I know good bagels and damn good bagel sandwiches. 

They are not here. My first trip in, I just picked up a Rosemary Olive Oil bagel with nothing on it. I'll be honest, it's good! Doughy, with that sort of crunchy outer shell. Good flavor. Moist. I enjoyed it.

Second time in, I was met with a lot of: \"We don't carry that\" and \"we ran out of this\". It was 9am... You're seriously already out of items that you still have signs up for?

I ultimately settled on the Rosemary bagel again, but toasted with sausage and egg. You know something's wrong when it's ready in 67 seconds. They don't make the eggs fresh for you. They're already formed in a perfect disk with that weird fluffy quality not found in normal scenarios. The bagel wasn't really toasted either. The sausage is the same perfect shape as the eggs and just kind of tastes salty and processed.  

Very disappointing that they don't really have fresh ingredients. I was hoping for and expecting so much more!"}
{"text":"Like any new establishment there's wrinkles to iron out such as making the soda fountain fully operational and making sure food prices in the registers are the same as on the menuboards.

As for signage I agree that without visible signage that can be a factor for long term success.

FYI, Brueggers offers 1 hour validated parking in the parking garage."}
{"text":"I come by for lunch a few times a week. Food is good, inexpensive, and the staff is always helpful and friendly.

Breakfast sandwiches are a bit expensive compared to what you get, but lunch is a good deal."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and have been on the hunt for a good bagel shop/bakery. I have been here twice now and haven't been impressed either time. The first time I went inside, which was nice. I ordered the cinnamon bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I must say, that cream cheese is divine!! The blueberry muffin was a joke...really greasy and not tasty. I came here again for breakfast and went to the drive thru, which was really fast and efficient. I just kept it simple with a plain bagel and plain cream cheese and didn't have any complaints. All in all, this place is OK but nothing special. I really wish they had more bakery items to choose from since their restaurant has the word \"bakery\" in it."}
{"text":"Bruegger's has a good variety of food for breakfast and lunch. I have eaten in and grabbed something to go and the service has always been great!  I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Bagels are so good and they have the best breakfast sandwiches. I've been going here for over a year now and will keep going."}
{"text":"Eh. Eating a sausage, egg and cheese on an asiago bagel right now and I'm so unimpressed, I'm taking time from eating to write this. It tastes like fast food. Not at all what we expected. Got the 2nd star for the staff that was very friendly and efficient. Certainly not worth over $8 for two sausage, egg and cheeses."}
{"text":"This was the best New York style bagel place anywhere in the East Valley.  They are now closed.  A sign on their window said they had closed due to unforeseen circumstances, whatever that means. I am truly saddened to see this location close. I will not be driving 30 miles to the location in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just picked up a half dozen bagels and strawberry cream cheese.  Drinks were orange juice and frozen mocha coffee drink.  Drinks were good.  Bagels were just okay.  The bagels were a bit chewy but standard for a chain bagel shop.  The cinnamon sugar one rated best.  They worked out great for not being near our local bagel shop.  Would like to find a good shop on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is evidently a new location, very close to my new apartment which is sweet.  The ladies were all super nice, I had a lot of fun talking with them; my bf doesn't like eggs, at all, and she was kind enough to make his bfast bagel w/o egg and extra other stuff.  I had the \"skinny\" sandwich which is eggwhites, turkey sausage and sundried tomato spread on a thin bagel, would have been awesome if the spread wasn't kind of ketchup-y.  My only \"complaint\" - otherwise highly recommended!  Oh, parking is kind of a pain, not many spots out front, but they offer free valet for an hour!"}
{"text":"Alas, this location has closed in late March. :( 

Been a Bruggers fan since I lived in Colorado, but all the ones in Central Phoenix keep closing.  Having a bacon, egg and provolone breakfast bagel and coffee was a weekly tradition.  I like how this location used to always play '70s soul music."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. I got the western breakfast sandwich. Pretty good sandwich, but small portions left me wanting more. The flavor is pretty good if you like chipotle. The peppers added nice texture to the sandwich too.

Mostly people just coming in to grab a bagel or coffee on the way to work. 

Overheard: 
grandson: what's dui mean?
Grandma: *pause* umm... Drinking... Under the influence."}
{"text":"Back when I lived in Minnesota, where Bruegger's was everywhere and Einstein was an exotic, out-of-town treat, I never thought I'd be nostalgic for Bruegger's bagels. Guess what!

This is a cute little store, and the staff is sweet and nice to customers claiming freebies, which is sort of the test of customer service. It serves highly assimilated bagels -- think of them as Reform Bagels rather than Orthodox Bagels -- that are nicely flavorful and chewy on their own Reform Bagel terms. They have added a rosemary olive oil bagel since I left Minnesota, but really, the joy of Reform Bagels is flavors like blueberry. (These bagels are, however, somewhat closer than their roots than Paradise Balery's bagels, which are basically bread in a torus shape. PB bagels, even when delicious, have married out and celebrate Christmas.)

If I worked or lived in this little corner of the Biltmore neighborhood, I'd be sneaking here with my laptop to wallow in strong coffee and honey-walnut cream cheese, while watching the sun turn all the glass buildings copper-colored."}
{"text":"I was driving around this morning trying to fend for food.  I was tired, barely caffinated and needed something to eat, and quick.  Its been a while since I've been inside a Brueggers, so I thought it would be different and I came here.

The place is okay. Kind of a weird setup, but it was alright.  They had a weird selection of bagels.  Im traditional with my bagels, and dont care much for some of these crazy concoctions that they have these days.  I know some folks like sundried tomato coffee organtic free range flavored bagels, but not so much for me. (no such bagel flavor, but its the eccentric part that gets me.)

Anyways, I just wanted something in the tummy.  SO, I ordered a smoked salmon flavored bagel with capers, tomatos and plain cream cheese.  On an onion bagel. (dont worry, I was dining alone, so no worries about my poor breathe afterwards. LOL.)  

But it got confusing because the girl that helped me told me to go to the register and pay, and my order would be up shortly.  I think it was because the 2 parties ahead of me, and both were ordering enough bagels to feed a small army, part of phoenix, and well, it was taking forever.  So, I went to the front of the line and paid.  I told the register girl what I had ordered, and she wasn't sure what I was talking about, so I had to point to the menu to show her what I ordered.

The bagel itself was tasty, but was a bit heavy on the cream cheese.  I forget that bagel shops put so much on, so I will have to remember to ask for less creme cheese next time I go there.  I will most likely be back, but not as often as I would like, since it was just a-okay."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a toasted everything bagel with schmear.
I was given a toasted everything bagel with schmear.

Was it the best bagel I've ever had.  No

{"text":"Went through Phoenix on a work trip and was very pleasantly surprised...it took awhile, but the salmon with cream cheese, capers and onions was fantastic with a bagel toasted just right with good balance of crunch and ingredients."}
{"text":"Brueggers was my DC area go-to for a yummy morning soft-wich or the post-lunch cookie break. I did a little dance when I saw it in the Biltmore area... everything is just as good as the E Street experience and the lunch sandwiches are pretty good if you are too lazy to walk across the street to the restaurants. Oh... and I recently discovered that their teas are really yummy too..."}
{"text":"OK, so maybe I haven't tried everything on the menu which includes soups, salads, sandwiches, etc. But their bagels are amazing.  They are baked fresh daily and have the back east taste that not many competitors can match.  The bagels are soft, chewy, and dense throughout, unlike grocery store bagels and bagged bagels that are usually full of air and have no density.  Brueggers Bagels are fantastic, they hands down beat an Einstein's Bagel, and I will not buy bagels from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Came here for some breakfast bagels since it's across the street from my office.  The people there do not speak English very well therefore we had a language barrier when I was trying to order a ham, egg and cheese bagel sandwich.  It took a lot longer than necessary to place what I considered a simple order.  Took the sandwich back to the office, it was really nicely wrapped, but honestly, the sandwich had no taste to it.  I had to load on the salt to make it even taste like anything.  I was so disappointed.  It was reasonably priced at under $4 for the bagel sandwich, but I wish it would've tasted a little better."}

I walked buy and decided they would work for what I needed. I only got expresso so I can't talk about the rest of what they had.
The place was clean and neat. 
The expresso was much better than Starbucks.
If I was in the area and wanted a cup of expresso I would go there again."}

Here's mine.....

Saturday morning my daughter and I were interested in getting some bagels on the way home to enjoy with my wife for brunch. It was about 10AM and I was excited that we were close to this Bruegger's. I remember going here often when I lived closer but haven't been there in a while. We went in and got into line after trying to figure out where the front door was. There was a couple in front of us who asked a simple request but the manager told them that they would not do that for them. The woman explained how they could do this and the manager just didn't listen. The couple left without getting their food. 

Now it was our turn. My daughter likes cinnamon & raisin and I like cinnamon & sugar. They didn't have either, and then I noticed they didn't have many others. There was very little variety there, and I was disappointed. (Einstein's always has people making more. I didn't see anyone making anything!!!) The manager said she could have the worker wipe butter all over a plain bagel and then pure cinnamon and sugar all over it. I was a little annoyed since they only had like 5 different sorts, so I told them to make it. The worker had no idea and tried to smather butter all over my bagel and then run sugar into the cream cheese I ordered. Terrible. Really worried. 

I got my daughter a plain bagel with cream cheese and hoped it would be ok. Really boring and not what she wanted. (They had nothing near what she liked). She was excited to stop to get \"doggie bagels\" for our puppy, so we asked for these. The guy looked at us like we were from Mars. He said snootily that they didn't have them. I know Einstein's does. I asked if he had anything like this that my kid could feed her dog and he was nasty to us. He told us NO and took our money. Gave us our change, didn't bother to cut our bagels at all, and I was really annoyed and will not go back.

Skip this Bruegger's completely. GO TO EINSTEIN'S!!! They are nice to us, have bagels, and doggie bagels. I felt like I was in ghetto bagel join with mean people.
