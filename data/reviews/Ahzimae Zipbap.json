{"text":"Really disliked my experience here.  Soon tofu soup was so bland, never had such flavourless Korean soup like this before. No pork, no clams, no protein in my soup.  Everything about the food served was very unsatisfying.  First and last time there."}
{"text":"good place for family

hall service very much kindly
this restraunt is good for everybody in Toronto and specially for Asian peoples"}
{"text":"Pretty biased considering my husband and I have visited this place 1-3 times a week for the past few months. The waiters and waitresses are incredibly friendly. Their Bibimbap is always fresh. Their kimchi is delicious, and they always have very nice appetizers that they're never stingy with handing out extras of.

Things we've tried here:
-*Bibimbap: Always fresh. Use a tonne of veggies. Absolutely cannot go wrong with this.
-Bulgogi SsamBap: So good. Very reasonable portions and always fresh.
-*Spicy Pork & Squid SsamBap: Amazing; better than expected. Would highly recommend.
-Spicy Chicken on rice: Not bad at all but would not get again. Have better dishes.
-Bulgogi dinner: Again, reasonable portions. Wish this was spicy, but it's still very good.
-Spicy Dumpling Hotpot: Not bad at all - prefer other hotpot over this, though.
-*Pork Bone Hotpot: Highly recommend. Fantastic dish.
-Pork Bone Soup: A soup version of the pork bone hotpot. Also delicious.
-Blood Sausage Soup: Tasty. I put my purple rice into the bowl (comes free with the meal) and it was very filling this way.
-*Blood Sausage Side Dish: Sooo good I cannot express how much I would recommend. Get the small unless you want some to take home, though, unbelievably filling.
-*Dumpling Side Dish: Again, soooo good. I can't imagine these are not made in-house. They're excellent.

Basically, a very healthy option if you want to eat out regularly and not end up feeling like a beached whale. Fair pricing, fair portions, and deliciously fresh food = all wins in my book.

{"text":"Authentic Korean food; kinda like home style Korean cooking, not as heavy-handed on the seasoning as some other restaurants in this area. Feeling like some comfort food on a rainy day, so soup and seafood pancake fits nicely for the evening. Parking spaces are few and limited though."}
{"text":"So how do you make your restaurant unique if you are located in an area with lots of other Korean restaurants? In the case of Ahzimae Zipbap, it's sticking to the basics. 

Instead of following the footsteps of other Korean restaurants and try to please all other palates, they stick true to what each of the dishes they offer it's done in Korea without adding or taking away seasonings or key ingredients. 

This restaurant is known for their Ssambap which you can get with a variety of hot plate dishes with beef, pork and squid that comes with lettuce, perilla leaves and rice. You put the rice, meats and spicy condiments in the lettuce or perilla leaves and eat it. They also offer a variety of soups and stews too. 

The restaurant is located along Yonge street in North York right before Steeles. This place used to be known as Kkothalmae. It's in a plaza and parking spaces are very limited. There's a side street that you can park but there's restrictions during the day. 

The inside of the store is not very big and the decor is very minimal. There's a TV playing Korean shows. Space could be tight and I don't think it's ideal for groups larger than 4 people. The washrooms were clean. 

We ordered the Spicy Pork Ssambap, the Spicy Pork and Squid Ssambap and the Busan Style Pork Soup. The food was great and reminded me of my mom's home cooking. 

The service was good even though there was only one lady working in the front. It was busy on a Saturday night. A steady stream of customers came in during our meal and all of them were Koreans. 

We'll definitely be back even with their lack of parking."}
{"text":"I walked in alone for lunch today. The waitress greeted me in Korean. Then she kept speaking to me in Korean. I sat down and order the food since the menu is in English. My tofu veg soup came with purple rice. The side dish was good with 7 choices. Overall the food was very good and the service experience is also very good!"}
{"text":"This place is the most authentic Korean food I have tasted in Toronto. Their Dae Gi Gook Bap was amazing. Their side dish is also very tasty and authentic. Highly recommend it to the Korean food enthusiasts."}
{"text":"The grilled mackeral and bulgogi ssambap came w/ a variety of veggies (lettuce, kale, cabbage etc). It was satisfying to eat the wraps with rice and banchans. However, the mains were too ordinary to justify for the cost. I've had similar flavors in other K-restaurants."}
{"text":"I tried both the Jeju style pork noodle soup and spicy pork noodle soup. Both were very yummy! The noodles had good texture without being too rubbery and was able to withstand the hearty broth. Great for cold winters like what we are having now. I enjoyed the soondae because they had a lot of japchae like what they sold in the markets in Seoul."}
{"text":"Update of an update of an update ...

The owner is a very nice man, the chef turns out amazing meals and the service is very polite and efficient.  Had the non-seafood \"champong\" today which was very different to the kind of champong which I am used to, but it was tasty.  Many of their dishes are reminiscent of Pusan-style cooking.  This place always reminds me of Korean home cooking.  One of their signature dishes for us is their kimchi-chigae.  Masses of luscious mukenji-tasting kimchi in a garlicy, tangy and delicious broth ..."}
