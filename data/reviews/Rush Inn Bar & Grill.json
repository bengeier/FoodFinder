{"text":"The nastiest perch dinner anywhere ever.  Everything on that plate tasted off - the potatoes, the slaw, the fish.  The 'fish' was practically nonexistent in a heavy dark breading.  My husband NEVER leaves anything on his plate - he left it.  That says it all. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Average sums up this place. I ordered hot wings and a side of fries  our waitress brought out fries a good ten minutes before my wings. That was annoying. My wife ordered a beef brisket sandwich of some sort. The thing had unannounced red peppers on it. 
My overall impression was slow and average. Disappointing."}
{"text":"What happened! Haven't been there in awhile but wow!. They added a area enclosed for more room. Good idea but didnt work out to well. The band was screaming in our faces so we moved. Ordered our drinks only to have the unprofessional waitress tell us they didn't have them but they were on the drink list. The smoking area is rite next to an open door in the new area that has a way of carrying the smoke from outside into the bar area.nasty. won't go back!"}
{"text":"Food is good. However, not all dinners come with sides like the menu states so ask before you order. Also, our steak was ordered medium and came back well done. No beer on tap."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game with friends or family. Decent beer selection, large alcohol selection. Local menu options. Entertainment available in the evenings. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Joined friends for lunch. Very busy although server was attentive the kitchen was a bit slow due to high volume of wing orders. Two of us had special of perch wrap with lime salsa.  Absolutely delicious.  Suggested they consider putting on regular menu. Two friends ordered burgers which they enjoyed. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"No pierogi on Friday during lent!!!
 Out of Pierogi's on Friday during lent at 5PM.!!Shockingly poor management. I'm speechless and without Pierogi's.
Last week they ran out of fish, fries and coleslaw on Friday during lent.
Heavily advertised fish fry! What gives!!!!!"}
{"text":"As my boyfriend and I sit here at the bar, we are 2 of 4 people total, the bartender is on the opposite side talking with friends making them drinks, while we have been sitting here with menus down ready to order. we have waited 5 full rounds of keno and still no service. For the prices of menu items, service makes this place just as undesirable. Will not be here again."}
{"text":"Being a native eastsider I was a little upset when my parents picked up and moved to the far westside while I was at school ( a little notice huh?). Anyway since there move I've needed to find some new \"local\" places for my visits home. Rush Inn looks a little bit like a newly built dive bar but that is part of the charm. That and the exceptional bar food. I'm not usually a wing fan but their extra large \"Rush Inn\" wings are out of this world (my favorite anywhere). Only down side is as a limited meat eater (with a vegetarian father) they have removed some of my favorite items from the menu (bring back the lobster ravioli and portobello mushroom!) Really nice outdoor patio in the summer too."}
{"text":"Great meal!!! Service was awesome and we had 15 people....food was delicious!!! Potato pancakes and pierogis are great"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem in avon!!! Great wings, lots of good drink choices and of course my favorite things keno and photo hunt!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times and have only gotten wings so my 4 stars are for there wings. I like the mango jalapeno the best but have tried most flavors . I also like the dry rub ranch and teriyaki flavors. On this visit I tried the wings dipped in flour first before cooking, would not recommend doing that , not quite as good . I always ask to be cooked extra crispy and they never disappoint. They have happy hour and daily food specials Tues and Thurs are 55c wings. There is also a Lakewood location just as good but the Avon location has a creamery now a fancy name for ice cream have not tried it."}
{"text":"Just way too expensive for mediocre food and disinterested servers.  No one ever seems to be happy to be there.  There's always an odd group dining and at the bar; I never feel welcome or appreciated.  I believe a tall Great Lakes draft was $8.50 or $8.75.  That's ridiculous.  I do like the wings, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I worked here for about a month, before I was physically assaulted by the drunken owner.  I've been in the service industry for 15 years, and have seen some pretty shitty owners, but none as bad as this guy.  Way overpriced, for crappy bar food."}
{"text":"I was gonna give this place a two star review for service until the bartender made it 5 stars. We sat in the high tops by the bar to watch the cavs game. Our server was so bad. I don't know maybe a new server or new to the service industry. Didn't get our drinks for like 15 mins. She messed up our order and had no personality whatsoever. We moved to the bar because two seats opened not because of the server. The bartender did everything in her power to restore our satisfaction. She was awesome!!! She even bought us deserts and made mine into a milkshake. Thank you for that. Also the wings were good I got the mango jalapeño ones. I forget your name honestly but you deserve a round of applause."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this bar on regular basis. We never had the (mis)pleasure of meeting the \"owner\".  Unfortunately, we had the misfortune of meeting him last weekend.  We came in and mistakenly sat to close to his seat.  He proceeded to berate us and make a big production about where we sat.  I know he owns all the seats, but I assumed he was smart enough to realize that seats  with paying customers were more profitable than empty seats.  This place will not get one more dime from me.  It's a shame because the bartenders there are very cool, I will miss them.  Maybe he should drink at home, instead of driving his customers away."}
{"text":"A causal place to hang out and order great sandwiches or wings. I went on a day that it was $2 taco night and the tacos were soooo good! The Perogies were also delicious. The prices were a little high for my taste, but the food  and atmosphere were good enough where I would go back sometime."}
{"text":"The cod had better flavor than the perch on the Friday fish fry. The Cole slaw was sweet and tangy and very good!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it is a little overpriced for the quality of food. Decent for a quick bite- but not somewhere I'd go for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Wow..... that was the worst service I have ever had in my life. Alex. Stay away. Food was warm, not hot. My table, nor the 5 around me, ever received a refill. Table next to me never got their food, and left. He told them he forgot to ring in the ticket, after 45 minutes of them sitting there. 

Manager never came around to touch tables. Of course.... She couldn't even be found to tell her to fire that lazy and incompetent excuse for a server. He honestly made it that 4 sets of customers would not come back.

Finally, when I flagged him down to give him my card, he came back 10 minutes later with just my credit card and slip. No original check, OR PEN! So we left with no tip, (not that he would have received one) or a signature. 

I try to support local business but I will never visit this location again. And that's a shame......"}
{"text":"This place does have great burgers for sure and their potatoe skins are the best I've ever had. The meatball sub was a little lacking. Good place to go for sure, and with little to no wait each time a definite mainstay of places to go back to."}
{"text":"I like the Lakewood joint, but have had three (how stupid of me) meals at Avon's Rush Inn. 
My short review is \"Don't\"Rush In
Problems with poorly prepared hamburgers (Hamburgers, for god's sake!) and over cooked/burnt turkey burgers. Even the salads don't get up to the \"so-so\" level.
 It may be this place is not a lunch spot (which is when I'm in the area.)...Servers seemed unconcerned or disconnected, hard (HARD) Acid rock blaring and a total of 3 tables occupied in the joint during my entire stay.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a buddy last night because it was wing night and we heard they had awesome wings. 

It was a nice place. Dimly lit with plenty of TVs. Tuned to ESPN. Looked clean from what I could tell. Buddy ordered a Pepsi and I a Long Island. Long Island was perfect. Friend ordered 10 garlic Parmesan wings and a fried bologna sandwich. He said both were excellent. I just ordered 5 Sweet Heat Teriyaki and 5 Chili Diablo wings. You can choose between \"breaded\" or \"naked\". Go with breaded. Trust me. These were the best wings I've ever had. And I've had many a chicken give their lives so I could have wings. Both flavors were very good thigh the Chili Diablo was the better of the 2. 

Got another Long Island and a Diet Pepsi and the bill came to about $20. Pretty fair if you ask me. Service was also up to par. Nothing special but not bad."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go-to spot! Always impressed with their menu and never had a bad meal there.  Kitchen stays open till midnight, a rarity in the suburbs.  Love their chicken Paprikash over a Pierogie!  Sunday night Steak special for just $10 is great too.  Buffalo chicken dip appetizer is very unique. My husband goes nuts for the Macaroni and Cheeseburger. Good nightly specials and lively bar scene, plus outdoor seating."}
{"text":"So many things challenging with visit to Rush Inn, felt compelled to share... food was just okay and drinks pricey vs. comparable places. They support local musicians, so I really want to like and support this place. Even willing to overlook bad service as newer server not knowing job. NOT willing to overlook other patron sitting at table next to us, upwind, chain smoking. NOT crowded,  many tables available, on other side of patio, downwind of all other customers where smokers could smoke it up without ruining experience for others. WHY would staff not look to create the best experience for all customers? So many comparable places, ambiance and experience are the differentiators. This place does not deliver. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I recommend sitting at the bar only because that's where they're on point. Tables have insanely horrible waitresses.

Convenient neighborhood place but the bar service is the the thing to note. Table waitresses are all around terrible."}
{"text":"Outside Patio, love it. Great Portobello Melt sandwich. Great service on the patio, and reasonable prices. Like this place."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to the Rush Inn in Avon - we would go there frequently and just within the past weeks the prices sky rocked. Just 2 weeks ago, On a Saturday, I got 2 tacos (which were terrible) and my husband got a bowl of chili (which was not good) I had 2 Bud Lights and my husband 2 Crown Royals and our bill was $60 - seriously! I ask the bartender if they changed their recipe for tacos and chili as they were not good, she said they got a new cook. Well, you don't raise the prices, get a sub par cook and expect people to return - we won't !!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice.  A cozy inside dining room and a bar on the other side.  The food is pretty good and the beer is always cold!"}
{"text":"I would LOVE to give you a 5 star rating BUT everyone needs to improve something. We have dined at Rush Inn twice.. the first time we had wings...... by far, some of the best wings in the county !!! The second time we shared the Rush Burger , along with the portabello mushroom appetizer AGAIN no disappointment there. This will be a frequent stop while in the area good prices, excellent service.... wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable about the menu.... all around great place to hang out with friends and have your dinner. Definitely  worth your time to stop/"}
{"text":"Cannot ever go near this place again! The manager Ashley should be out of a job. The way she treats employees and bad mouths these hard working individuals to paying customers is disgusting. I've been er seen anything like it!! We watched her complain to a customer about a worker for over 10 minutes. Very rude very condescending. Paid our drink bill and walked out without even ordering dinner, vowing to NEVER return again!! I cannot spend hard earned money on any establishment that mistreats their workers. She needs some serious anger management and classes in professionalism!!"}
{"text":"Well, to start the outside looks nicer than the inside.  If you don't mind sitting on plywood booths, you're in luck!  Service was less than stellar and the food...ugh.   Ordered the cheese and bacon fries in hopes it was similar to the Outback.  Nope.  It was shoestring fries with a mound of Cheese Whiz in the center.  Oozing and orange and SO disgusting.  Turned everything it touched to mush.  It was horrid.  We decided to try the Thursday night wing special and if you enjoy a flavored wing with an underscore of frying oil flavor, you are in luck!  Overcooked and dry - thank God it was only 55 cents a wing.  Save your money and drive down to BW3.  I guess if you're a beer hound this is your place otherwise skip it.  You are not missing anything. Will try to upload pics of the um....food."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I stopped at this little joint on the way to camping in East Harbor.

I don't really have much to say since we didn't stay long and we didn't eat. You know what we did do though? Drank some dang good bloody mary's, that's what!

We weren't really expecting much from a little place in Avon, just off 90W. Probably some travelers, regulars and that's it. We walked in, found some seats at the bar in front of the Ohio State game and the day was already off to a good start. 

The bartender came up to get our drink order almost immediately. She had tailgating on the brain. I appreciated that. We ordered a bloody mary eash and zoned back into football mode. I wasn't paying attention to how she was making the drinks, but I wasn't expecting much. I looked up and was pleasantly surprised to see her adding a Guiness floater to mine. I've never seen this before but it looked and sounded delish.

I was right! So good! Not only was the bartender super friendly, but she made some bomb-diggity BM's. Also her name was \"Cara\" with a \"C\", which made her super cool in my book. Needless to say, we thought we were going to grab one bloody mary and go... but I definitely opted in for another one before we left."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly atmosphere with a delicious food menu.  Bar area seating space is almost an inch from the uncomfortable zone with the booths that are lined against the wall.  Prices are on the higher side compared with other in the area.  Offers an uncovered patio area."}
{"text":"Met here with a work group and we sat out on the patio. The place was nice and clean, and the patio was awesome (other than the sun not quite cooperating). Had some mussels as an app which were on special. They were okay, but lacked the flavor I was hoping for. It was $6 cheeseburger and fries night so I went with that for my main meal. The cheeseburger had great flavor and was cooked just the way I like - a tad under well-done (sorry, no vampire burgers for me). The fries were good and the beer was cold. Our server started out pretty good, but towards the end she was hard to find and she totally messed up everyone's bills, which took her some time to correct even though most of us were far beyond ready to go. I'd go back again, just hope the service is a little better."}
{"text":"I've been to the Rush Inn in Avon 3 times in the last 60 days, so they must be doing something right-actually quite a few things right. First, some of the best chicken wings in the area-crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside served with bleu cheese dressing and several big sticks of celery-a classic. Here's a suggestion-order the 12 wing appetizer and a big wedge salad-best guy lunch ever! BTW, the wedge is huge with diced red onion and generous chunks of bleu cheese. Also tried some of their specials-stacked chicken entree is delicious and served with brown rice and broccoli. Wait staff was fast and friendly. One side note-the background music is classic rock and for Led Zep, Traffic, Stones, Jethro Tull etc. fans, it was great."}
{"text":"stopped in for the first time sunday night. I had the Pierogi Chicken Paprikash , and it was great. live music playing in another room, sounded good. friendly wait person. might only complaint is the hard wood seats, otherwise I enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"A half way decent place if you're in the neighborhood. Menu looks spectacular, but the food is just okay. I did have a friend that loved the artichoke dip. Service is hit and miss. Had the best bloody mary, then another one night. Came back for more and got a f you for all I care bloody mary this time. The music will make me linger, classic rock. Next time I'll patronize one of the other two drinking establishments when I'm there."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the slow/poor service and some of the prices I'd give it 5 stars because the food is actually great! Especially the wings. Just dont go here and get something unless it's one of the daily specials and not very crowded."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Rush location in Lakewood, where I usually get my fix, but I've found myself here a few times now. This Rush Inn has very similar food (but not quite as good) as the original location, which is a great start. Their wings, latkes, and burgers are all justifiably celebrated by legions of fans. Service is usually pretty good, but it can get crowded and servers can get a bit harried. I've never sat at the bar, but the pours for drinks served at tables seem downright stingy (this has happened during multiple visits), which is disappointing. Overall, though, this fills a void in Avon and is pretty reliable."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience tonight! We got a table quickly and then sat there for about 10 - 15 minutes with no server ever coming over to our table to get us a drink or anything? We complained and then they said they would get someone. The waitress kept helping the table next to us even though she never looked our way at all! The hostesses were both baffled and offered us water but it was too late and already 9:00 pm and we wanted food and a beer after going to a track meet all night and working all day! Don't go here if you want good service or any food after 8:00 p.m.!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place with an acceptable selection of draft beer (I like the Sweetwater). The service is friendly and there are enough tvs to watch. The food isn't very impressive for the price, hence the 3 stars. If the food were better, I would give a better rating. Traditional dive-bar food with a slightly better atmosphere. The food is what is really holding this place back, and it isn't priced competitively enough to make it attractive. I've eaten here a dozen or more times because it is acceptable and I live nearby. The patio is enjoyable. It's acceptable, but not quite noteworthy."}
{"text":"I think I definitely like the Lakewood location better, but this one has a nice patio.  

I got a hamburger, and one of the previous reviewers was right - they can't cook a hambuger to save their lives here.  The kids got some safe chicken fingers and ate them, so I assume they were OK since we didn't have to run them to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped later that night.

Good beer selection, so I guess if you just need to stop somewhere to pick up a few, this is as good of a place as any.

But if you're looking for the good Rush Inn food, spare yourself the agony and go to the Lakewood location."}
{"text":"Mediocre bar food at best. The Oh my Gouda burger was dry and uninspiring. We shared a Buffalo Caprese salad that was OK other than the flavorless tomatoes and the crab dip was overwhelming with mayonnaise. We did enjoy the fresh pita chips that came with it.

Our server was inexperience and knows nothing about food or customer service."}
{"text":"I just discovered this little gem hidden away in Avon, OH. You can sit on the bar side or opt for the restaurant side which is quiet and comfortable. Typical bar and grill eats with some extras thrown in. Wings are delicious and they have 3 wing special nights a week! Nice variety of mixed drinks and PLENTY of brews to choose from. Nice prices too. My family will definitely be regular customers!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a coworker and my husband to split some appetizers and have a glass of wine. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and knowledgeable with what was on the menu. I had a bad experience with the food once before, but the service has always been excellent! Last night we had the blt dip, chicken sandwich, and wings. Everything was excellent! The wings were hot and crispy, the portions were big, and we all left full! I loved the music selection, and it wasn't so loud you couldn't hear the person beside you, but loud enough to enjoy! Rush Inn has definitely redeemed themselves on the food. Everything else has always been enjoyable."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon after seeing decent reviews on yelp. Wanted to do 4.5 but not possible. Food was very good, most of menu items are made from scratch, and had a good variety. For a local bar and grill it is very good, and exceeds expectations, although I reserve 5stars for a true culinary experience. 

Ashley was our bartender, and she was great. Attentive, friendly, knowledgeable , and had me try the \"bunny pajamas\" beer which I liked and would not have tried otherwise. 

Had a good variety of beers, and a very tasty Bloody Mary Sunday special. Good atmosphere for everyone, friends, family, and otherwise. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food! The Perogies were delightful and the Caprese Salad was delicious! Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Whether you just in the mood for a few beers or a meal with a friend or with the family, young and old, you can't go wrong here.  My number 1 pick would be any of the burgers.  Nice assortment of both \"bar food\" and good dinner menu.  Great patio during the summer and plenty of room inside and usually don't have to wait long for a table.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I can't imagine why I would ever visit again!  The food was awful and drinks were way too pricey.  Ordered two entrees, 1 bottled beer and 2 drafts our total was $55 without tip.  This could be an amazing place with having the patio and live music. However, there are many great patios with outstanding food and drinks in the surrounding area that are far better to spend your time and money!"}
{"text":"Checked in at lunch when I walked in and the lady at the door acted like I was bothering her. Sorry to bother you. 

Server was prompt and took my order right away. Seems like an old school style bar and restaurant complete with 70's music playing. Older clientele in the joint as well. If you are in your 40s to 60s you will appreciate the place. They have good daily specials. 

I ordered the rush burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium and it came out med - well. Flavor was good char grill. Bacon was crispy and the sautéed mushrooms and onions were good as well. Sweet potato fries were hot, cooked right with a dusting of sugar. 

Overall, this place met my expectations. Next time I want typical bar food and want a 70's music fix I'll head here."}
