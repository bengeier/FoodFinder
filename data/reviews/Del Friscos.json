{"text":"This is the best italian restaurant in Montreal I've been to.
The pasta is very good.
Also, the mussels are very good too.
The buns taste great and are very fresh.
Service from the staff is very good.
The restrooms are very clean.
It was a great experience."}
{"text":"I ate at del Frisco recently. The service was good and friendly. The food was tasty. We both ate the same thing, the lamb shank from the table d'hôte. 
Later that night we were both very ill. We are casual friends so this was are only thing we both did. I called the restaurant spoke to the manager who was more interested in answering the other lines to take reversions.
Basically I was told thank you for calling.
I will never eat there again and will recommend to my friends they avoid del friscos"}
{"text":"Amazing meal,  food was fresh,  fast and excellent tasting. Service was efficient and the price was reasonable. Great experience"}
{"text":"Used to go a lot the first two years. Got tired of the increased heavy use of convenience food used in their dishes. If you order a salad be prepared for some misplaced flavour combos and ingredients from the can. Do not order the salmon salad unless you substitute the dressing- otherwise you will get suger syrup. Pizza is decent but premix convenience doe is used and again- beware of canned/ unfresh ingredients. I usually take the italian sausage, but again I got tired of eating gummy factory doe. As for the parm that was mentioned... what you ate was barely passable as fresh food. The parm is factory prebreaded, the tomato sauce is factory and the vegetables on the side are sous-vide from factory. Here's the bad part... if I'm wrong about the parm it still tasted like an excellent restaurant portion microwave dinner. Service: Once you're sat down, the service is great. Don't go on Habs nights unless you are a fan, because the bar area is very loud (which is normal). I suggest to choose a seat on the opposite wall if you really want to have a pleasant dinner, because the booths on the opposite side of the bar don't cut it for privacy on these nights. The terrace is good in the summer for drinks with friends... if it weren't for the torturing, tasteless music that is typically blasted. Wine by the glass is expensive for what they serve- so don't get picky go for the house wine- no difference. Mixed drinks and cocktails are usually well done and never had a bad experience with the draft beer."}
{"text":"The staff are polite and fast. The food is good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed."}
{"text":"I went here with my mother, brother and his girlfriend for my brothers' birthday. 
Let's just say I'm only giving 2 stars because the sangria was lovely.......
Eggplant parm was fine 
Pizzas were tasteless 
Alla Gigi was bad....all the dressings were set and hard

Would never come back....not worth your $$$$$"}
{"text":"Atmosphere friendly, congenial and the food and staff just fantastic. A great place for a business lunch and dinner. The bar is a great start to this resto."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Annie, was very knowledgeable and gave us excellent service. The mushroom soup was fresh and tasted homemade. Scrumptious! We had crusted ahi tuna for the first time and it was excellent. The apple croissant with ice cream was great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was delicious! Frutti de Mar with cappilini. Didn't leave a single thing on the plate."}
{"text":"C'est une cuisine italienne parfaite qui utilise toujours les meilleurs ingrédients pour la confection de leurs plats succulents. Le restaurant est souvent plein le vendredi et le samedi soir alors réservez tôt. J'ai beaucoup aimé!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, this place is fantastic! Wonderful service from the moment we walked in. Our server was friendly, the food runner promptly brought us bread and oil, and even the manager was present on the floor supporting his staff (which is HUGE to me - says a lot about the way the establishment is run).

The food was superb. I had their house salad to start, it was great. The Hawaiian pizza was delicious and the cannolis for desert were a nice light finish. We also had a primavera pasta that was great. The pasta was a little too al dente but the chicken was perfectly cooked and came in a large portion.

Overall 100% would recommend!"}
{"text":"I Ike this place. The food is always good, I typically do pastas or pizzas. Many options on the menu. The pastas are always well cooked and tasty. The pizzas are awesome, wood oven makes it best! Calamaris are delicious too. They have a bar section that's always busy, good spot to have a drink and a bite. Very good service, always spot on. This is a keeper."}
{"text":"Not bad for a group lunch with coworkers last Friday! Ordered from the lunch table d'hote menu; got the vegetarian pizza with the house salad for $21 total. 

The complimentary bread they serve while you wait is delicious, warm and fresh. The service was decent considering how busy this place was. The pizza's dough and crust was perfect and the portion was great, got 2 slices to go. 

Got to try a mussel, and some fries from others and it was all really yummy. Trying to flag down a waiter at the end to get a box for my food to go was a little difficult but I would consider going back for a nice sit down lunch. Not every day though as $20 adds up and it's difficult to be in and out within the hour mark."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends and familly! Convenient location and delicious Americanized Italian food. My favourite plate is a chicken topped with goat cheese and grilled peppers. The staff has changed quite a bit in the past few years. The typical pastas have unfortunately become not very special but we still enjoy visiting every now and then!"}
{"text":"Ambiance Super! L'assiette de calmar en entré trop grosse mais bonne. Bon choix de vin!
Service impeccable! Sauce bolognèse beaucoup trop salée, gâche la sauce!
Surtout qu'il y a du sel sur la table!"}
{"text":"Had multiple pizzas, chicken parmigiano, shrimp appetizer. All good. They also have a cool bar section."}
{"text":"Great kid spot for pizza evidently. Not so much for adults. The calamari was like rubber. Veal Marsala was average at best. The Valpolicella  was decent hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is your standard chain-like Italian restaurant.  The bets thing was the service.  The food was fine, nothing special.  This place is BUSY.  If you are looking for quiet and intimate look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"It is a nice Italian restaurant that is located in the West Island mall. The staff is very friendly and they honour reservations. The atmosphere is nice the bar was a little noisy. The menu has a great selection from pasta, pizza, veal , and sea food. We ordered Pennie arrabbiata and mussels in white wine . The last time we were here we had pizza which was good . The meal was perfect and the service was great . We will be back"}
{"text":"Un restaurant familial parfait pour les groupes et les grandes tablées. On y mange une cuisine italienne simple et variée avec un grand choix de pâtes (les spaghettis aux gambas \"Athéna\" on eu un grand succès), pizza ( dont une très bonne \"roquette-pecorino\") grillades, salade (très bonne salade type César revisitée avec des légumes marinés et grillés. )
Si on avait su que les portions seraient si imposantes on aurait sans doute évité de se jeter sur les petits pains chauds accompagnés d'un mélange huile d'olive- vinaigre balsamique servis en attendant nos plats mais il était dur de résister ! 
Et puis les plus petits appétits ont eu droit a un doggy bag. Par contre un tiramisu pour 9 nous a suffit car nous n'avions vraiment plus faim !
Le service est agréable et attentionné, nous avons été servi rapidement et avons passé une très bonne soirée."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had there tonight! Drove to Montreal this morning and went for dinner with Mom at a restaurant of her choice, Del Friscos. I had told her of my experience at Il Fornello's on the Danforth just last night, so initially she thought I may not want Italian again, but I was all for it.

I remembered this place as being where the East Side Mario's was that we drove by on our way to the much cooler (at the time: mid 90s) Jack Astor's around the corner.

The arrival was a bit messy as there was no host around and the passing staff paid us no attention. I saw there were some great hightops in the bar so we grabbed one of those. I wanted to keep tabs on the ballgame (playoffs) and besides, my Mom would be the first person to sit on that side anyways!

Our server was really good. Fantastic timing and very easy to talk to. She told us that after ESM, the building was converted in to a large pub which never took off, and then Del Friscos for the last 4 years, and she's pretty much been here from the beginning, after 5 years at a nearby Kelsey's that had closed down (chains don't generally do so well in Quebec). She did have another table's appetizer on our bill though. If I hadn't looked at the bill myself, Mom was about to pay an extra $20. That would have fully soured the experience

This time I ordered the Chicken Parm with a side of penne and my Mom grabbed the lasagna (she had had it before and LOVED it. I don't think she even looked at the menu.) The portions were great, the salads refreshing and the comfort level in the bar was top notch.

Looking forward to a return visit! (Oh, and for you Habs fans out there, apparently Larry Robinson is friends with the owners so he has a dish named after him and also does the radio ads on the local sports radio station!)"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Service SUCKS, food is mediocre, and they don't have tirimisu. They are on the way out and they deserve it."}
{"text":"Just a really quick review for this place. I was in the area for work and came here twice for lunch. The service was really prompt and the food was overall pretty good. The place was kept clean and the servers really friendly. I ordered the meat pizza both times and would come back again for it. Recommend this place for a lunch stop or even for a drink after work in Boucherville!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We go there about once a week or so and I have never had anything that I didn't like.  The salads are huge and combine unique flavours of veggies, nuts, fruits and greens.  The pizzas are cooked in a brick oven and they can't be beat.  Add to that, the fun atmosphere and excellent service and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great location. Not sure why the low star reviews. Great food, full bar, not too expensive! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing too special but nice spot for lunch. I grew up in the west island and am quite sick of the small selection of restaurants but this one is pretty good on occasion. I've come here a bunch of times and nothing was ever out right bad. They are tasty and standard dishes that won't necessarily \"wow\" you but will definitely fill you up. My last visit was this week for lunch. I had the table d'hôte mussels and fries. I asked the waiter which sauce he recommended for the mussels. I told him I liked spicy food so he said he'd make me an spicy tomato-based sauce. It ended up being delicious. My normal experience here would probably be about 3 stars but this last experience bumped my review up to 4. The waiter was friendly and attentive despite the lunch rush. The Caesar salad wasn't very good and the quality of lettuce used was poor.

Service: 5/5
Food: 4/5
Value: 3/5"}
{"text":"L'accueil est souvent assez froide. Les gérants sembles interdire d'assoir les clients à certaines banquettes, en tout cas, on nous l'a refusé la dernière fois, avec comme seul argument \"Je ne peut pas vous assoir là\". Pourquoi refuser aux clients une banquette dans une section où il y a un serveur? Nous avons quitté pour aller ailleurs où nous avons été accueilli les bras ouvert. Bouffe correct. Serveurs sympathiques."}
{"text":"I'm a fan,

go there often,

pizza is always a win win, rack of lamp and scalopini, love it!!"}
{"text":"A great family restaurant! Perfect to celebrate any type of occasion. I would definitely recommend to get their grilled chicken or their veal scallopini. Their caesar salad is to DIE FOR with their yummy croutons. The service is really friendly and it has a really nice atmosphere. The only thing I was disappointed with was their cocktails. Not really a fan. But, all in all, i've been here a dozen times and will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Pros
- Tasty appetizers
- Creative and balance martinis

Cons
- Way too pricey
- Snooty wait staff

My waiter acted like he was doing me a favour serving me. Everything came with a sigh and a face. Regardless of the food and drink, I won't go back because I simply didn't feel welcomed there. My friends and I wanted to continue our night so we just crossed the parking lot to Jack Astor's, where we felt the staff were happy to have our business."}
{"text":"\"Nice family restaurant, with decent food at a decent price. Nothing outstanding, but fun to attend!\""}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant italien, les pizzas sont très bonne. Moi j ai pris la Larry Roberson et les pâtes sont bonne et les portions sont généreuses"}
