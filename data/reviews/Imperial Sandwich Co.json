{"text":"I ordered the BBQ sandwich. I was disappointed to find the pretty good BBQ brisket was piled on top of a very cheap bun that clearly couldn't live up to the deliciousness of the beef. The weak bun became very soggy very fast. If I'm going to pay $8 for a sandwich on a cheap, crappy bun at least give me a cheap, crappy side with it."}
{"text":"Imperial Sandwich Co was parked outside Birdsong Brewery last night as I walked by it perked my interest, but I really wasn't that hungry. Then when we were seated there were menus on the table.  A menu with all kinds of deliciousness, I could not refuse.  

We ordered the Cuban and a Bacon Grilled Pimento Cheese.  Both sandwiches were loaded and the perfect amount of gooeyness.  Any sandwich you have to wash your hands afterwards is fine by me.  I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"I'll refrain myself from the lengthy wording and leave a little to the imagination. In short: my Cuban sandwich was bomb"}
