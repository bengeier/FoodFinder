{"text":"Maybe the four stars is too generous after just one visit, but there's something about this place that's very comforting. Maybe it's the community seating, or the simple white bowls your veggies come in, or maybe it's the simple fact that you're eating your veggies and enjoying them too. I tried a yummy coconut curry with crispy tofu and appreciated that it was just the right portion for the price. I'm gonna try a vegan tsoynami with vegan tsoft tserve \"ice cream\" (spelling is correct) next time I go."}
{"text":"+ positive, -negative, -/+ neutral  + The food is amazing.  They cook their tofu just right: crispy, tasty, fresh.  I'm also a huge fan of the Greenburger.  I would have to say it's even better than an In-and-Out burger (although now I'm a vegetarian).  - The food is good, but definitely not healthy.  Grease, with a side of fat.  -/+ Seating could be better.  I don't feel relaxed here.  + One word: Soynamis.  These are frozen yogurt (soy, of course) treats with mix-ins, like fruit, nuts, etc.  Perfection in a cup.  -/+ Service.  They get your order in quickly and get the food to you fast.  However, I always find myself a little bummed out after ordering, they never smile!  + Limeade.  It's really, really good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the \"No Harm Chicken Parm\" and their soynamis are delicious. Best vegetarian/vegan place I've been to in Arizona by far. It can get super crowded though, but that just goes to show you how good the food is."}
{"text":"This was a really great place, busy and a bit pricey, but they do deliver on the food.  The drunken mushroom chicken was great.  Not only the taste was better than most \"real\" chicken, but the texture was as good as I have tasted.  Save room for dessert though, as you have got to try their vegan soy ice cream, watch out 31 flavors!"}
{"text":"Just at there for the second time today, and decided to use my (overpriced) iPhone for some pictures - which I will add shortly. I really love this place, because they offer so many options, from pizza to noodles to salads.   First time I ate here, maybe a month ago, I got the Apricot Miso dish with mock chicken, and it was very good. Today I had the Spicy Peanut Sauce with Tofu appetizer and I had to restrain myself from licking the plate, the sauce is THAT good! The Coconut Curry with mock beef served over noodles was next, and honestly, it was just ok. I prefer the mock chicken texture/flavor. The curry was spicy but there wasn't enough of it in my dish - it was very dry.  But my favorite part of this place? The bathroom sink. It's totally cool, you just have to see it. Sorry, I didn't snap a photo in the bathroom for fear of being a total weirdo."}
{"text":"The argentine sandwich is do good!  So is the big wak!  The fries are also amazing and so are the drink options!  Appetizers were ok though.  The crab puffs and buffalo wings will never see me again... But the entrees have seen me twice and will see me a ton more times!"}
{"text":"I recently found out I'm allergic to dairy and eggs, so I was somewhat thrown into the vegan lifestyle. I had lost hope finding a restaurant where I can actually eat breakfast, but then I found this place! AMAZING! I had the biscuits and gravy with tofu scramble, and it was to die for! Come eat here...NOW!"}
{"text":"The food is good here but it looks like new management has taken over and the portions are quite small. I ordered a rice bowl and there were about 4 or 5 small pieces of tofu and like two tablespoons of rice. I was ready to have another bowl when I got done eating the first one I paid over $10 for. My husband and I were very disappointed and we will never go back there again. They are way too stingy with their portions. Total rip-off."}
{"text":"Am I missing something?  Went to this place last night having read loads of great reviews.  We couldn't have been more disappointed.  The place is grimy looking, with an open kitchen that looks like it could use a good cleaning.  The staff is indifferent and the food a complete let down.  Got there not long before closing - no hours posted so we weren't aware.  This was obviously a problem for the staff as they acted like all they cared about was going home.  Why didn't they just tell us that they couldn't prepare the food properly due to the kichen closing soon?  We would have just come back another time.    We ordered the samosa starter - cold in the middle, coconut curry with crispy tofu - was soggy like it came out of a microwave, flatbread pesto pizza - burnt around the edges and cold in the middle.    We were reluctantly given a refund, as the food was inedible (in fact they took the curry away and never bothered to bring anything back).   And to echo a few others on here - lose the styrofoam and plastic cups and cutlery!  How green is your restaurant?  Not very.  Update 11/15/12  Went back here a few weeks ago, this place has really improved.  Best thing was, they're actually using eco-friendly cutlery/cups, etc.  Wahoo!"}
{"text":"Health conscious good food. Not expensive. Friendly casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly, very cute decor and friendly environment. We ordered the animal fries and they were blegh... too greasy and the potatoes seemed to be the frozen kind. The \"chikin wings\" we're some weird nugget looking things in some kind of chili sauce and they were toooo salty. However, their Philly cheesesteak sandwhich was DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"I appreciate the authentic taste of my veggies so I was disappointed (three times in a row) with the food being so damn salty.  Perhaps this is their way of enticing tofu-fearing peeps by loading every dish with an abundant amount of soy sauce.  It was almost as bad as tasting ocean water.  Every bite was overwhelmingly unbearable.  If salty sea water is your thing, then this is your place to indulge.  The best thing about Green is the \"soy-based\" ice cream: but that's probably because it wasn't so salty as the rest of the menu.  Oh, and the food gave my friend the terrible runs.  Ouch! Something to consider if you're not into \"mock meat\"."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  Some of the dishes are amazing, others are good.  I find it hard to remember what i have had to really try everything...  Absolutly recomend. -Back for the Humus and the Picnic Salid, both fantastic"}
{"text":"The waitress Mariah was very rude and ruined our dinner. All but one person got their food. They went up to the counter and asked her where their food was after waiting ten minutes. She snapped and said that it was coming. Then she proceeded to serve three other tables. Five more minutes went by and they went back up there to ask again about their food. Once again, she snapped and said it was coming. Obviously it wasn't. At this point half of our group lost their appetite and did not finish their meal. After waiting for five more minutes, for a total of 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served, we asked for a refund of the one plate. This was a $70 tab we will never get back and are very upset by one employee's attitude. She ruined our meal and did nothing but stare as one person in our party complained about her attitude. If there was an issue in the kitchen, she should have said that. Aside from the incredibly rude employee, the food was just okay. My burger bun was burnt and that is all I could taste. This was my first time and I will never return. The people with me have been here before many times, but they decided they would not ever return. It was a waste of time and money. She completely ruined our evening."}
{"text":"OMG the food was soooo good! Wish I had this restaurant next to my house! It was highly recommended by local friends so we tried it and so glad we did. Best vegetarian burger and wings I have ever had! Even my husband who eats meat said it was so close to it that meat eaters wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The fries were so good as well, thin and crispy and just perfect. I will always crave this place now =(  The server who brought our food and took our plates was really nice, but the girl who took our  order could have been a lot nicer and informative. She didn't smile and when we told her it was our first time here and asked for help for drinks she just gave a short answer. to come in at noon on Tuesday when its busier she should be nicer and more smiles."}
{"text":"If I knew vegan food was this fantastic, I'd totally convert and be a Vegan. I recently went to Green out in South Scottsdale and I have been trying to eat my way through the menu.   For their starters, I've tried the samosa, the chili fries, the egg rolls and \"wings.\" Out of those, I'd say my favorites have been the wings. If you didn't know they were mock meat, I'd still think they were just like boneless pieces of chicken cause the sauce with the wings was fantastic. And the chili fries were fantastic! I usually get the chili on the side to avoid making the thyme fries too soggy.   I've only done two of the bowls - the drunken mushroom chicken and the diablo red with mock beef. The two bowls were seasoned fantastically and yummy. I do need to try more bowls. I've tried more of the sammies and burgers. The original \"g\"spicy po-boy is fantastic, but I may be biased since I really loved the wings and that's what they put in this po-boy lol. I tried their no-harm parm chicken sandwich, but wasn't that big of a fan of it, but it was because my mock chicken patty and its breading was coming off and apart due to the tomato sauce so it wasn't enjoyable. My favorite by far was the Mexicali burger; it's a fantastic, slightly spicy, mouthful. As I've said, I'm trying to eat my way through the menu, but I couldn't pass up having another mexicali burger again lol.   The tSoynamis, their ice cream dream desserts, are a simplistic tasty orgasmic mouthful. The have specialty ones featured off their usual menu; I love their recent one with the butterfingers. It's so yummy and makes me want a butterfinger lol. Their Soy Captain tSoynami makes me want Captain Crunch. Their Cookies 'n' Cream and Ts'more tSoynami is yummy as well. The Cookies 'n' Cream one is a chocolatey heaven. They have an awesome PB&J tSoynami, which is by far my favorite!   I am so going back and making a dent in their menu!"}
{"text":"If you don't have food allergies or intolerances, than this would be a great place to enjoy vegan food. They have pretty tasty alternatives to meat and dairy. However, I've been sick for three days after eating there. I ordered everything off the gf menu but still had a reaction. I was a little worried when my chili came out with fried chips on top, but I double checked with the employee who gave it to me. He double checked with the kitchen, so I thought I was fine. Nope. So either the chili is a problem or the banana cream pie soynami (with gf options) from Nami next door. I almost brought one of my children, who has an even more severe reaction to gluten, with me. That would have been a disaster!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but this place is delicious. I've been here a few times and got a couple different sandwiches and one of their bowls and everything I've had was really good. I'll take their Big WAC over a Big Mac any day."}
{"text":"Green is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! Hands down!  I am in love with their \"crab\" puffs, the kung-pao noodles with \"chicken\", thee green salad, and they always have great specials.  Oh yeah, and they now have Daiya \"cheese\", which is the BEST vegan cheese around.  I can't say enough good things about this place.. If you are vegan it is a definite must.  If you would like to try some awesome vegan homestyle cooking, Green is a great place for you too."}
{"text":"@ Mary F., grow up. You are throwing a tantrum like a child. The fact that you are writing a 1 star review and calling the new menu awful when you clearly said you haven't been in to try anything yet negates the trustworthiness of your entire review.   I go here a couple times a week so I have familarized myself with the new menu. First of all 75% of the menu is THE SAME. They got rid of the items that were boring and unpopular, except for the Green Burger which I do miss. You're sad about the sweet and sour being gone? Why don't you try something with actual flavor? The Singapore Orange and the Thai Peanut are delish, not to mention the same format as your beloved bowl just with a different sauce. And the Lemon Pesto and Alfredo bowls they added are sooo good.   Green does NOT use Boca patties, and it is petty to spread misinformation like that, especially when you are going off of secondhand accounts. They hand make their patties like always, they just make them in a different way. The Big WAC is a heavenly creature btw, so maybe try that before you continue whining.  And if my memory serves, they added ONE salad. If you look online, you can see they have six salads now. Six. Hardly contributing to the \"vegan stereotype.\" If you continue using your math skills, they have ten starters that are not salads (including the buffalo wings), eight different kinds of bowls, nine sandwiches, plus mac and cheese and their specials which always taste good. The majority of the menu is not salads, so you can quit your raging. Good riddance.  Green, lots of people love you, the new menu, and what you do for the Phoenix community. Please keep up the great work and ignore immature people throwing temper tantrums."}
{"text":"Love Green. For someone who recently became vegan, it is our go to place for comfort food. If they are offering a special, get it. The specials are always amazing.   We have taken vegan friends and carnivores with us and they always love it.. most are especially enamored of the Big Wac."}
{"text":"Love this location. Fun building and local art to look at. The people are always friendly and helpful about the menu.   Love Green. For someone who recently became vegan, it is our go to place for comfort food. If they are offering a special, get it. The specials are always amazing.   We have taken vegan friends and carnivores with us and they always love it.. most are especially enamored of the Big Wac and Wendy's Pickle."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I am not a vegan or vegatarian. But seriously, this place is freaking amazing. I'll admit I was a little skeptical about the whole vegan thing but they proved me wrong.   I get the Thai spicy \"chicken\" salad. It is the perfect amount of spice for me, not too spicy but just enough to give it flavor. The \"chicken\" is so good and flavorful. If I didn't know it wasn't real chicken I would have been fooled. Their oatmeal cream pie just the right finish to the meal.   The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe. All along the back wall they have old car doors lining the bottom half. On other walls, they have local astists display their artwork that you can buy. It's just a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Green. Every time I visit, either at the Tempe location or in downtown Phoenix, I am blown away by how good they make meatless options yummy. Also, the Green in downtown Phoenix now has alcohol. Sign me up...  Cheers."}
{"text":"Interesting items on the menu, with good flavors, only thing is that everything is salty, especially the burgers. Interesting place to take friends from out of town but not really a place we eat on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm a meat eater, so I've been shrugging this place off for quite a while, but I stopped by once and grabbed a \"Wendy's Pickle\" and my mind was blown.  This place has GREAT food. I've had something different every time without a single bad experience.  I'm all about this place. I can't believe it's vegetarian. If all vegetarian food tasted this way, I'd convert in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Best Vegan Big Mac ever!!!  Second time in 2 days. Animal fries are the best too. Can't wait to go again tomorrow to try the mock chicken sandwiches"}
{"text":"I finally ordered from here last night had the wings and the cheesesteak when I tried both the flavors were there but the texture seemed off... I'm not currently vegetarian or vegan but have been for about half of my life,well after I are my dinner I started to feel sick now I've been dealing with food poisoning since last night. Service was great but I don't like being sick because I wanted a quick meal after a long day ,sadly will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and I'm not even a vegetarian!  First points go to the ambiance... the place has kind of a cool \"green\" feel to it, but is also very modern and open.  The garage door in front opens during nice weather, and the place is very airy.  Second points go to the food.  I really have no idea what I'm eating, but I've been a few times and haven't been disappointed.  Service/staff is pretty good, they definitely fit the theme of the place.  Minus one point for having an awesome staircase that leads to nothing but an office... and a tiny bit of a point for recommending \"Nami,\" the place next door that I think they own.  It's a vegan bakery that is overpriced with so-so taste."}
{"text":"mmm vegan fast food or I guess comfort food. :) Lots of great choices here, love the crab puffs, and the Thai noodle bowl. Service is always fast and friendly and the decor is artsy. Very cool place to hang out and eat."}
{"text":"I really like the food at both Green locations, as well as Nami. I'm not a resident of Phoenix, but whenever I'm there (not often enough) I  try to eat there as often as I can. My favorites were the wings, a couple of the bowls, \"wings\", the Pickle etc..."}
{"text":"I don't give out five stars lightly. This place was good. We went there twice while we were in town and the second time we got two whole other meals to take with us and eat for dinner later. They have soy milkshakes, people!!! We had a peanut butter and jelly shake (tsoynamis, they call them - so cute!) and one with almond cookies and caramel. We had appetizers and sandwiches one day and a salad and pizza the next. We got take-out bowls - one Italiany thing my husband got and the most delicious mushroom with noodles bowl - I find myself thinking of it when I get really hungry. Everything was tasty. Super tasty! I'm glad they're not too close to home or we'd end up going more often than we should and I would have a hell of a time resisting some of the less healthy menu items (hello fried pita). If you're going to the Phoenix area and you are vegan you better go here!"}
{"text":"I ate here once when I was in Phoenix for a Lana Del Rey concert and it rocked as hard as she did!! I had the vegan big mac and it was SOOOOOO good! I was recently in Sedona and was bounded and determined to stop here and eat on the way back to L.A.... only to find out they are closed on Sundays! Nooooooo!!!!! That made my taste buds very very sad. )-:"}
{"text":"Wonderful to have a place with a real vegetarian menu and tasty options.  Chili fries?  Amazing. Noodle bowls?  Delicious. Soy ice cream?  YUM.  And, it's pretty inexpensive, considering.  You can for sure eat for under $10.  Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in phoenix- it's always the first place that comes to mind when deciding on somewhere to eat... I love their original \"g\" sandwich- it's the best menu item I've tried so far. Some other favorite dishes of mine are the kung pao, diablo red or thai peanut bowls. Everyone I've ever taken to this place is crazy about the tsoynamis and thyme fries. Anyone - vegetarian or not- will enjoy the food here ."}
{"text":"Love the idea, awesome having Vegan or Vegetarian choices choices, however, always red light when food is served in 3-5 minutes.  My fries were cold!! So disappointing, and my burger was good, but did not feel fresh. I have never been disappointed waiting in a restaurant 15 min for quality food, check out True Foods, thats hot and fresh. Cmon Green stop being lazy and make it feel healthy and not fast food lazy people working mentality and focus on quality. I was planning on bringing customers to this place for lunch, but not anymore."}
{"text":"I almost cried the first time I went to Green. For me one of the toughest things about going Vegan was having a place I could trot off to for something stupid like a hamburger. A place I don't have to feel empowered and enlightened just because I wanted to go out to dinner. Not all of us want to feel a smug self righteousness all the time  while we eat raw beets with a side of dirt. Sometimes a Vegan just wants a hamburger. Is that asking to much?! Not anymore. Thank you Green don't listen to the nay sayers. There stupid anyway.  PS my meat lovin man asks to go here. So yep it's good to really good. Get the hamburger and thank me later."}
{"text":"Hungry? Go here. Not hungry? Still go here. They have everything you could possibly craving and then some. The vibe is cool and even their ice machine is badass."}
{"text":"The Ranchero salad and eggless rolls are phenomenal. Great staff, great environment, great food."}
{"text":"The Vegan Chili Fries were bomb! The Calexico Burger was delicious, and I had a Kitty Diddy tSoynami and I just couldn't get enough of it...I will def be coming here more often"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Big Wac is a must. Dog friendly as well. We sat on the patio and they brought out a water bowl for our pup."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great selection and I'm very impressed with the flavors they get out of the dishes here. This is our favorite vegetarian place in PHX. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I had not figured the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area to have much in the way of veggie food, being a vegetarian from Austin, where EVERY restaurant has veg options, but then I discovered Green!!!  The service is awesome;everyone is knowledgeable on the menu offerings and makes wonderful suggestions. I have been to Green well over 10 times, but my favorites are still the \"crab puffs\" and the \"original g po-boy\"  I have found that even my non-veggie friends have loved all of the mock meat selections and found the taste and texture to be spot on!!"}
{"text":"Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ \"Chicken\" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.  The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.  Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.  Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. \"Turkey\", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my go to place to eat when I was in Phoenix. They have a great menu and everything is delicious! I loved the specials they had and the BBQ sandwich was the absolute best. Also, try the fries: you won't be disappointed.  Staff was also super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the service was great. Got the big WAC. Amazing!!! Highly recommend getting the Sangria too. Crab wantons were bomb diggity."}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN COMFORT FOOD -try the sweet potato puffs  Green is a haven for vegheads who are looking for some comfort food.  With stellar sandwiches like the G-spicy po'boy and the Secret BBQ chi'kn sandwich, Green disproves the notion that vegan food is rabbit-food.   Don't be shy here, the staff is generally very friendly and happy to suggest their favorites.  I've found that the staff is happy to oblige simple requests like more sauce and more heat.    Yes, I've personally had every sandwich, salad, and appetizer on the menu - my favorite is the Ranchero Salad (easy on the flour tortilla strips).  ...and I'm working my way through the bowls.    Don't miss trying the Thyme Fries or a Tsoynami.  They're great to share, especially since you also split the guilt of these treats."}
{"text":"I am here to tell you that my relationship with Green is like a revolving door. I'm vegetarian, I want good vegetarian food, I go to Green, I find it adequate but not overwhelmingly amazing, and yet... I keep going back. I'm still holding out hope that Green will one day knock my socks off, it just hasn't happened yet.  That last two times I have gone, my food has been cold, especially the french fries. Cold french fries are not good, people. Nor are they difficult to make. Last time I got the spicy po-boy, which I found a little bit too spicy, and overly salty. The bowls are better, I love the thai peanut bowl, it's one of my favorites! Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things.  I've been a bit disappointed lately, but I will keep going back for the concept, the cool couches, the awesome drink and ice cream selections... what can I say? It's a vegetarian dream."}
{"text":"Yum!  I was skeptical about going to this place because I had been there once before (about 2 years ago at least) and hated my food. However, a friend convinced me and I decided to try it again.   Well, I am glad I did! The crab puffs were AMAAAAAAAAZINNGGG. I love crab puffs and was so happy to have a vegan version that didn't taste gross. I couldn't even tell it was vegan cream cheese (I'm sure we all know it's usually hit-or-miss) or fake crab! Also, I had the orecciette pasta with the no harm chicken parm, and loved it. The only problem with that was that even though they used Daiya vegan cheese, which I love, is that they just lumped it on the top and it was impossible to spread around, so that kind of ruined the parm part.   Also, their vegan chocolate chip cookies are incredible and I couldn't believe they were vegan so I even asked again just to make sure! (Yes, they're vegan).   I will definitely be coming here again. I'm dying to try the artichoke dip and their tSoynami's!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out based on good reviews. I was not disappointed.  I have been there twice and would definitely go back.  Green is located on Scottsdale Road and tucked away in a small strip mall.  It's not fancy but the food is terrific.  I had a spicy salad, and my daughter had a parmesan sandwich.  Both were excellent.  I love the green tea.  I will of course return for my third and hopefully more visits. Wish they had a place in Chandler or other locations.  It's the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service.  Some staples: No Harm Chicken Parm, Mooshroom PoBoy, thyme fries My favorite place to hang out & catch up on reading while enjoying the food and surrounding people and energy.  A nice break from the old town Scottsdale crowd that is near where I live."}
{"text":"We have been a long time customer at both locations but have not been in for some time.  We noticed the menu change, which is fine but the price increase is pretty ridiculous.  Almost $9 for a kids burger! Are you f*&%ing kidding me! You also have to pay separate for fries/sides.  I guess you have to be a rich snob from Snottsdale to eat vegan these days."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The Tsoynamis are delicious and the mock-chicken is the best I've ever had.   I'd recommend a rice or noodle bowl of some sort - I love the sweet n sour one.  I've had the burgers and pizzas before and I don't think they are as tasty - fake cheese just doesn't cut it sometimes.  But the noodle or rice bowls are worth coming back for over and over again.  Local art on the walls and counter-style service really make it a great place to meet for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"You don't have to be vegan to enjoy this place! The fries are a must,the \"burgers\" are all good here, and the \"wings\" are awesome.   This place definitely has the hipster vibe. I recently had one of the po boys and the \"steak\" was kind of rubbery but the veggies and sauce was still good.   Oh and you have to go next door to Nami to get dessert after!"}
{"text":"Green is pretty amazing. Their sticky bun is the best I've ever had, vegan or no, and blows Cinnabon right out of the water. I do wish their outdoor seating was not made up of metal chairs -- it's Phoenix for goodness' sake! But their food is worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food was Amazing! The Big Wac is definitely a Big Mac in disguise! The wings are fiyah and the Wendy pickle taste just like chicken, I'm stoked!"}
{"text":"Love the \"Argentine Po-Boy\" sandwich, and the thyme shoestring fries are my favorite side. Many mock meat alternatives which are quite tasty. I am a total omnivore, but love a good veggie meal. Just two or three tables outside, but great to bring the dog!"}
{"text":"Eating vegan felt so bad...but not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good.  Seriously it is really nice to have a vegan option that is just straight comfort food.  The place is never too packed and is super casual.  You walk up and the hardest choice is what to try.  Don't worry you can't go wrong.  Every time we have gone the cashiers have been very helpful if you are still deciding between two options.  For food, I would recommend the BBQ po boy.  It comes with a little kick.  The fries are always good and come with a great ketchup.  I am not a big fan of the thai slaw, so I would definitely go with the fries.  I have also had the pizzas and they are always safe.  The veggie burger is good, but if mushy burgers freak you out, then go another direction.  I do wish is a was a bit more firm.  If you are looking for a ridiculous treat, grab a Soynami on the way out.  My fave is the mint chocolate version.  One small thing that I do hate though is they serve them with wooden spoons and I am a bit weird and HATE eating off a wooden spoon.  Am I weird?  The soynami is so good, I still do it though.  Finally I am happy to have this place in town.  I am always amazed that Phx does not have more dedicated veg/vegan places for as big as it is.  If you are a fan of That's a Wrap, then you will be satisfied here - same ownership.    Another tip - Check out the t-shirts for sale.  I love my ninja deer on a bike shirt!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. We recently moved out of Arizona, and I miss the food and the fun environment at Green. While I have been eating a plant-based diet for a long time now, Green was really helpful when I first started because I could find vegan comfort food. When I got tired of beans and rice and vegetables, Green was a place where I could get variety and now understand that vegans have tons of food options.   My overall favorite meal there is the no-harm chicken parm, but I also love the bowls when I want something lighter (particularly Singapore orange and blonde Alfredo). I also can't avoid the tsoynamis, although I generally eat the entire thing at once and then feel crummy from sugar overload which is totally my fault. If you're vegan and are craving chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, try the dough boy tsoynami.  The staff is always friendly, and I love the diversity of people that come eat at Green. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Hey vegan!   Yeah you.   Get your skinny ass down to Green for some seriously good food.   Seriously.   The mock chicken rocks.   Go. Now."}
{"text":"Great place if you're vegan and want some burger or sandwiches. Severs are helpful, choices are plentiful, and portions are reasonable."}
{"text":"Creative menu, yummy and affordable vegetarian food! 4/5  J and I are not vegetarians but we were up for a new restaurant and adventure on Friday night. We met up with P and R (vegetarian) at Green around 8pm for dinner. The food was amazingly delicious and cheap! We all shared some non-meat 'chicken wings'... it was so GOOD! our food came out tasty too. J's 'chicken' sandwich was great with its yummy BBQ sauce... Would definitely go back again for other dishes."}
{"text":"Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the \"boneless buffalo wings\" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu \"the Wendy's pickle sandwich\" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is \"the big WAC\" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!"}
{"text":"this place is 100% vegan and AMAZING!! as a vegan i really appreciate good alternatives to my old junk food faves like their animal fries (SO GOOD) and buffalo chicken!! also their ranch is the bomb!! (if you're dairy free you know how hard it is to find good ranch lol)"}
{"text":"I had the Hummus and Black Jack Pita and both were great. The hummus was really flavorful but the chips were a little over cooked for my taste but were not burnt. The pita was delicious. It wa a robust sized wrap and a pleasure to eat. The food is reasonable priced and the people are extremely friendly making for a really good experience. I will eat here when I'm in this part of town!"}
{"text":"It really sucks that I have to give a bad review but know its NOT THE FOOD its the SERVICE...the food is excellent loved it but the workers ESPECIALLY the one at the register that has been mentioned over and over again in different reviews as being rude is definitely RUDE...im so confused at why she's still still working there!?! if you dont like your job QUIT its that simple...probably could get more business if you guys ditched the mean girl waiter/ cashier...food is yummy though but I can get yummy food and great customer service somewhere else..wont be spending any more money at green:)"}
{"text":"Seriously - as good as it gets! Amazing menu and great food to boot! Myself and friends got vegan chili fries, crab puffs, no chicken parm, and it seemed like lots of other things all EXCELLENT!   The same person owns the ice cream place next door...great soft serve and treats. Be sure to check out the \"winkie\" (a vegan twinkie!)"}
{"text":"Green is ONE of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I'm not a vegetarian, I just enjoy good food.  Walk in usually there's a small line, grab a menu near the only register and choose your items. Don't be like Susan who waits last minute to look at the menu at the register holding up the line. You order and they bring the food to your table.  My top 3 favorite dishes: Thai Peanut Mock chicken bowl, BBQ Mock Chicken sandwich, and Jerk Tofu Salad. Jerk Tofu is tangy and over a bed of greens is like flakes of heaven.  If you need a little more bites: Thyme fries, just skinny fries with thyme. Buffalo \"Wings\" are delicious, they're just like the real thing, but a little chewier. If you like curry, the samosas are superb. I could eat 3 orders of them throughout a binge marathon on Netflix.  If you still have some room in your tummy, you MUST get a Tsoynami! They have seasonal flavors and their standard ones. I usually try the seasonals, but PBnJ is also my jam *pun intended.   The staff is friendly and good at giving you some recommendations, if you decided to pull a Susan."}
{"text":"The right vegan food for non-vegans! Most vegan and veg places simply preach to the choir and just don't do a good enough job of attracting omnivores. That is where this joint stands out.   The mock chicken dishes were just great with the right amount of spice and flavor . The decor is decidedly hippiesh but not overbearing . We went on a Thursday evening and it was CROWDED! there was a virtual nonstop line but totally worth the wait. Ask them to make the entrees a little spicy and then enjoy them with their homemade lemonade.  Dont forget to try the incredible vegan chocolate cake! Their specialty ice-cream is great too."}
{"text":"I have been eating a vegetarian diet for about five months now. My first month from switching from a carnivore diet to the veggie life was not too difficult due to the amazingness that is Green! I recommend their \"Big Wac\" w/ thyme fries! Also, their mac & cheese is amazing!"}
{"text":"My first time at this location and having a big wac were not as good as anticipated.  The big wac was extremely salty and lacks flavor. All I tasted was salt but the patty's texture was good and the bread fresh.  The tomatoes were fresh and flavorful but the lettuce was watery and felt sparse for such a large sandwich.  The secret sauce was also very sweet and lacked flavorful seasoning besides salt. No sides came with the sandwich this was disappointing.  There is very little parking and the space offered is both tight and odd.  The inside lacks personality and decoration. It's a plain looking tiny shaped space. No nutritional information is offered or known by the employees or offered on the website or menu.  Also, the service was extremely slow it was well over 30 minutes before the food arrived. Unfortunately the overall paid experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, this is one of my favorite vegan restaurants in Arizona ! AZ is fortunate to have several! I walked in here tonight and my heart filled with happiness to see so many people here embracing the vegan lifestyle, after all peace begins on our plates!!!  Everything I have tried here is delicious....from comfort food with their burgers and fries to their bowls, delicious specials, salads and appetizers. Big wac is definitely a go to when I want something \" bad\" .  I have taken both my carnivore hubby and child here in the past ( but they both are now vegetarians ~ by choice.....yeah !!! Still hoping they convert though to all plant based diet though )And they even loved it then when they consumed meat.  You order your food at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food out to you. Outdoor seating as well, both in the front or the back of the restaurant . Friendly staff and I cant forget about the desserts next door.....omg....nights on 7th Ave are made for vegan foodies !!!!   I do have to warn you....parking can sometimes be a challenge but the meal is soooooo worth it !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Green on several occasions and I have never been as impressed as my friends. The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good, but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens. The green burger was okay but I was surprised by how thin the patty was.  I am in love with their french fries, however! They are incredibly tasty, whether plain as a side or as an appetizer as the vegan chili fries (by far the best item of their menu!).  The tsoynamis are delicious no matter what flavor you get and that is definitely a selling point!"}
{"text":"I love this place beyond words.  They have a good selection of vegan food, and their fake meat is awesome.The soynamis and oatmeal cookies are amazing.  Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"So strange watching this previously great restaurant plummet. The food is no longer noteworthy and the experience is below enjoyable. I have visited the Tempe location Green since 2010, and the Phoenix location since it opened. Meals that were once well made and adequately portioned now represent a hastily prepared snack. The menu has shrunk, and items that used to be paired - such as the Argentine Po' boy (no longer on the menu) and fries - are now sold separately. Remarkably, while menu items have removed major portions of the meal, the prices of these orders have all risen. Eliminating standard portions from long-standing meals and increasing prices is a bold move, and the absurdity is further compounded by the noticeably lower quality food. It simply isn't that enjoyable. The family members and friends I previously took to Green would always rave about the food and experience; I would not consider such an outing in the restaurant's current state.   *Fun Fact: the largest portioned meal is also one of the least expensive. Try ordering the chicken nuggets from the kids' menu. It looks like that section of the menu is still unchanged. I imagine the owners will make the necessary adjustments if they read this review (sorry kiddos).  The owners seem to be banking on reputation and being the only somewhat hip vegetarian restaurant in town. Using smaller sizes, higher prices, and fewer ingredients are all decent ways to increase net profit, but what happens to your once loyal customer base? Even the soynamis have smaller cups. Absurd."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time. With out question ether location for me is a go to restaurant. The Wendy Pickle with OG sauce is the best thing to have here for me. I will continue to come here as long as I am in phoenix for my Green fix. This is coming from an avid meet eater who loves everything food. I find this to be one of my favorite spots in phoenix."}
{"text":"Vegan food is so interesting.  I got a burger which had a patty that was orange on top and red on bottom so it felt like I was eating undercooked meat, which wasn't the case! Tastes like a real burger, sans meat.  The fries are so crunchy and delicious! Atmosphere is kinda hole-in-the-wall like and the people there are a variety of interesting people. Definitely would try this place again for their wide variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered online and my \"wings\" were ready when I got there about 7 minutes later. I love how simple it was to order and how fast things were ready. Food was great as always."}
{"text":"most of the things I have had here have  been decent.  Not mind blowing.  Nice to have this around as an option though.  Don't have the macn cheese but the fries, bowls and burgers are good"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I have been vegan going on three years and eating out at regular restaurants is always a challenge and not at all an enjoyable experience.  I usually just end up getting a salad.  Not here though.  It is awesome walking in and knowing that everything on the menu is not only vegan, but delicious!  No stress in wondering if the chef or any of the staff understand that butter is not vegan.  And don't miss going to Nami next door for an amazing vegan dessert!"}
{"text":"My vegan wife loves this place.  It's nice eating there, but I'm trying to avoid soy protein, and there are too few such options on their menu (I would prefer more non-soy entrees).  And a lot of the food is much too greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"Last time I was here I had the bbq pizza with mock chicken and it was amazing because I have been crazing pizza like crazy. I've also had their noodle bowls with mock chicken and they were yum yum. I don't usually love fries either but here they are just so good.   I also tried the soy ice-cream the last time I went and I fell in love. I definitely recommend you try it.   They also have a small little market by the cash wrap with cheese less mac n' cheese, vegan chocolate bars and other sweet things I haven't found at other stores.   I also like the laid back earthy atmosphere and the people that eat here are pretty cool too.  Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's a little expensive. But it's worth it on occasion."}
{"text":"Green....how I love thee.  Green may be vegan/vegetarian, but I certainly wouldn't claim it to be 'health' food.  Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!    The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).  Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!!   (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.  We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)  Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"I truly hope this was a one time thing as Green has always been one of my favorite places.  The food was good, not sure how they get the mock chicken to have the look and texture of what I remembered the real thing to be like.  The service however was another thing.  We ordered two Wendy's pickle sandwiches and an order of fries.  The fries came out pretty quickly a good 5-10 minutes before our sandwiches.  When I could finally get one of the food runners attention I asked about the rest of the order as well as why did she bring out the fries so soon.  The response was \"I know, we don't like it either but the kitchen just prepares the orders as they get the\".  WTH?  I told her I ordered the sandwiches the same time as the fries, shouldn't they then come together?  Her response \"sorry we have no control over the kitchen\".  Again, WTH kind of answer or logic is that for any establishment?"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan, far far from it. I couldn't be a vegan if I wanted to cause I hate most veggies.  My partner is a vegan however and I am always willing to try anyhting once. The meat-less meat actually has the texture of meat not mush.  I get the original \"G\". It is a buffalo meat-less chicken between two pieces of bread with tomato, lettuce, buffalo sauce, and some mayo like something as well. I get the french fries with this. I actaully crave this damn sandwich now. It is spicy so if you are not a spicy eater I would not suggest to get it. If you like spicy this might be the perfect thing for you. The fries are awesome as well. Shoe sting cut, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Mmmmmm. Just writing this make me want it. I also get the egg-less eagrolls. These are yammy as well."}
{"text":"I travel for work and eat out almost everyday of my life (since 2003) ... I'm not a vegetarian, but their food is actually pretty good. The fake meat tastes like meat! I love dessert so I'm a fan of their mixed shakes called \"tsoynami\". Sometimes I go just for this dessert."}
{"text":"Really cool and fun experience! Lots of dif choices of healthy delicious food and cookies! The wings are awesome and I love their teas."}
{"text":"Diagnosis: Delicious!!   I've heard this place was really good but I was still suprised with how great the grub is. I recommend the secret bbq chicken sandwich. The thyme fries are killer and the fruit salad was yummy too.  Prices were reasonable. Cool vibe. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"If you are skeptical of vegan and vegetarian food, I promise you that Green will change your mind. The varied and creative menu is full of delicious items that are not only good for you and the planet, but that also taste fantastic! I've brought several carnivorous friends to Green and they've all absolutely loved it and hoovered up items like the awesome Big Wac (like a vegan Big Mac...but so much better) and the just-spicy enough Jerk salad with tofu. Everything I've tried has been outstanding. The prices are extremely reasonable too. I am not vegan, but Green is a favorite place I go back to again and again. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We're giving three stars overall based on: 1.) Quality of ingredients 2.) 100% Vegan (which is rare) 3.) Gluten-Free offerings 4.) The diversity of the menu, including baked goods and vegan \"ice cream\" treats 5.) Okay, and they also serve alcohol  We can't give more stars because they were not earned.  We'd LIKE to give this place more stars, but we're very discerning. We went twice this week--once at each location. At the Phoenix location my companion had a noodle bowl with tofu, and I had the gluten-free rice bowl with tofu. Each bowl comes with a choice of protein: tofu, mock chicken or mock beef. You're getting charged for it, so you might as well pick one. We shared an artichoke dip appetizer that is gluten-free.  At the Tempe/Scottsdale location we opted for the large size artichoke heart salad. We had to choose a protein (it comes with it) so we chose mock blackened chicken.  We'll start by saying the sauces were terrific (Mongolian and coconut curry). We both enjoyed our flavor choices at each location.  The artichoke dip appetizer was very tasty and we would recommend it.  The downside: Take a close look at the photos and you will see large chunks of carrot and zucchini. While  we normally like these vegetables (we should--we are 90% vegan in our household and have high standards for a diversity of vegetables and food preparation. We also manage food allergies), we did not care for the \"bite\". The vegetables are crisp, about half-cooked, which is usually okay but not in this dish. We are actually used to preparing our dishes with these raw (100% uncooked) because we grate them or spiralize them, but we prefer them fully cooked when they are in large chunks.  Experiment/Note: Try shaving vegetables, grating them, or spiralizing them vs. chopping them into large chunks. You will find that the flavor profile is way different. Especially with a red onion. Thinly sliced is heavenly, but grate them and you're in for a horrible bitter taste that can ruin a dish completely. Super large chunks of red onion in a salad? Unheard of. Yuck. Same goes for carrots and zucchini.   So, the texture and bite ratio of the dish fell short. The large chunks off-set the dish in a negative way. They overpower and it is unpleasant. At home we spiral cut everything, so the bite ratio is evenly dispersed and not overpowering when we're making it ourselves.  Spiral cutting also allows for a lightness to the dish and a fuller plate. We WISH SO BADLY that Green would do this! We get the feeling that vegetarian restaurants serve a bulk of carrot and zucchini to add volume to dishes at a lower cost, and we have the sneaking suspicion that vegetarians eat them this way because no other choices are offered. We take what we can get.  At the Tempe/Scottsdale location our salad (thankfully) lacked the monster carrot/zucchini overdrive. The \"big\" salad did not seem that much bigger than the \"small\" salad. We had a problem with the blackened mock chicken. First, it was overbearingly salty. Yikes. Second, it played havoc on our digestive system later. Apparently we cannot handle processed meat substitutes--but we understand that a lot of people *can*, so we're just putting this out there.  We are of the philosophy that more vegetables are key, rather than simply substituting meat. Normally we avoid all substitutions and go for an abundance of colors....avocado, very thinly sliced red cabbage, spiral-cut or grated carrots, cucumbers, zucchini, etc. This salad had none of that, other than a few tiny pieces of artichoke, which left us wondering, \"Where's the artichoke?!\" Also, the salad contained a lot of very salty, but otherwise pleasantly crunchy, gluten-free tortilla strips.  We get a sense that Green is for people who rely on substitutes, reminding us of \"french fry\" vegetarians. We'd like to see more TRULY GREEN/NUTRITIOUS/LOW SODIUM choices, with more colors. Truly. We mean, we really do. This place has so much potential and it falls short, which is sad because the two locations are surviving in a city where vegan/gluten-free/organic restaurants are hard to come by. Maybe we're going there because there aren't many places for us to go--but you can create more converts if the bites are better.  We want to go back, but we will be disappointed if we do. We'll go back a few times a year, probably, for that special sugar splurge, for sure. The people who work at both locations are cool and totally nice, and the service was good on both occasions.  This is a sad love letter to Green. We *want* to love you. And sometimes we take risks in love. So we are hoping you find it within you to take menu risks with more vegetables in smaller bites, more colors, and no substitutes because, frankly, we don't need them. Give us an abundance of clean eating with those marvelous dressings.  In short: Grate or spiralize your veggies, add MORE kinds of veggies, and cut waaaay back on the salt. Also, give us a protein free option. We will be loyal forever."}
{"text":"Amazing  vegetarian food. Never knew vegetables tasted so good. I had the lemon pesto and the chili fries. Both are highly recommended."}
{"text":"New american veggie restaurant. ...pretty darn good! The fake meat is cooked well and has a good texture. We ordered the bowls, one with noddles and the other with brown rice and both were full of flavor and did not taste like what you would normally expect out of a vegetarian restaurant...it didn't tasty \"healthy\", it tasted good. We also got the spicy edamame.  Love the taste and the flavor, only flaw is the price point. I would come here again, but if the price was $2 dollars less on each item, I would come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Very tasty vegetarian food.  I wouldn't say everything is \"healthy\", but it's definitely the best vegetarian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I went with the reviews and got the Big Wac. I never even liked the real thing, but I really did like this version. I was so stuffed. That was a lot of food for me.   Shamefully, that didn't stop me from waddling next door to their sister place Nami for dessert. You can read that review. No need to post my pig out fest on both reviews. As I hang my head in shame and think.... YUM!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go here at least twice a month! The food is awesome! The 'Big Wac' is what McDonald's Big Mac wishes it could be. They also have a great selection of fresh iced tea as well. I don't have any complaints about this place. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"... Apologies, I was just daydreaming about the Green Burger.  If I could suggest to a meat-eater a place for them to experiment with eating like a veg, no doubt this would be the place.  If I could suggest to a veg a place to have a mouth-gasm, no doubt this would be the place.  Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk food. They have delicious salads, and was look like good personal-pan style pizzas. I'm a fan of the huge, size-of-your-face pizza slice persuasion, so I've never gone that route at Green.  Regardless, I would be willing to slap a $5 down on the table in front of someone at Green, and if they didn't like the food, they could take it and walk.  Their tofu/mock-chicken/mock-beef/mock-pork bowls are yum, yum, yum. I stick with the Singapore tofu, and it never fails to make my stomach smile.  And their tsoynamis are oh-so good. No, that's not a mistake, people. It's a soy Dairy-Queen-blizzard style cup full of sunshine. EVERY one I've tried has blown me away. Some I like better, but I can't judge. It's sweet. It's soy. It's goooood.  Sometimes when it's lunch time, or a busy Friday or Saturday night, this place can get packed. It's usually full of the hipster and indie kinds of people, but, that shouldn't in any way make you not want to eat there, especially if you don't look this way. Eff all of that, go for the food if nothing else.  Service is always spot on, and they're always keen to help you decide or answer questions.  If you want a good, entertaining view of all the fixie-riders (there's a bike shop next door, no lies!), albeit simply amazing food, I'm going to say go here.  P.s. The ladies bathroom has a cool piece of artwork hanging on the wall and an even cooler faucet fixture for the sink. P.p.s. The artwork in this place is beyond bitchin'."}
{"text":"Loved the local feel of this spot and appreciated the creativity of the vegetarian and vegan menu.  The interior is well designed and I really enjoyed their display of artwork by local artists.  The food was fantastic and service was extremely friendly.  I'd recommend this spot for anyone who loves tasty food."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my sister while visiting family in the area. Our cousin recommended it to us, and while neither myself nor my sister are vegan or vegetarian, we absolutely loved Green. The people that took our order and brought us the food were super friendly and genuine and the whole vibe of the place was pretty cool. There's art all over the restaurant, the other patrons were a nice enough mix of hipsters, families, and professionals, and if I recall correctly some good tunes were being played on the stereo.   Being on a bit of a budget, we each just got one thing and water to drink. I had the OG Buffalo \"Chicken\" Po-Boy with some fries and it was delicious! Like I said, I'm a meat-eater but was not left discontent; their mock chicken was just as good as the real thing with lots of flavor and everything else on the sandwich was fresh and tasty. My sister got the Thai peanut noodle bowl with crispy tofu and it was also well done, with fresh veggies, and a nice peanutty sauce that was a tad sweet, with some vinegar zip to balance.   Next time I'm in Tempe I will surely come back to Greens, and I recommend it to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike!"}
{"text":"Green is my favorite vegan restaurant. I have been to both locations and both are equally good.  Decent sized menu with good variation. My favorite dish would have to be the lemon pesto bowl with fried tofu. The first probably 10 times I came here I got that and nothing else. Other items I've really liked: BBQ bacon burger, Wendy's pickle, poor boy mock chicken sandwich. Salad with chicken. Chicken wings for appetizer are also great. Fries are very good. Milk shakes are great  Only two items I've had which didn't think were excellent were the shrimp appetizer and the big wac, and a curry dish (I eat a lot of Thia food though so hard to beat thai curry) I just wish one of the locations was open on a Sunday, and also the price can add up. Me and my gf came and two dishes a couple appetizers and drinks came to over $60. The food is quality and not greatly over priced or anything, would feel better about it if everything was organic. But those are small issues and overall it is definitely the best vegan location I've been to."}
{"text":"I need to deduct another star for their use of styrofoam cups.  Green definitely it's not."}
{"text":"The food is great but this is absolutely not a kid friendly place. No changing table, no outside food permitted, no high chair"}
{"text":"Very delicious food! We are not vegans or even vegetarians, but we just love this place! We have been trying to eat healthy lately, and this place was just perfect for that. The consistency of the mock chicken dishes was almost perfect, and we weren't left with that sick, full feeling in our stomachs. Wish this place was closer to where we live!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving Green an extra star is the Soynami.  Eh. I *wanted* to like Green. I wanted to LOVE it, in fact. But eh. I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but I do not eat dairy due to a major intolerance to it.  I went today for my second visit. Everything is fried, fried and fried. Why so much grease? Why can't vegan also be healthy?  Today I got the Jerk Tofu Salad. It was just ok. It was some greens mixed with carrots (the pre-shredded kind from a package) mixed with an equal amount of these fried stick things. The tofu was fried. \"Jerk spiced house tofu\" doesn't scream deep-fat fried to me, but apparently I am wrong. The carrots weren't fresh. The dressing wasn't my fav. I even asked for a different kind, and I got some lemon stuff. It was alright, but nothing to write home about.   I've made better dressings at home with just a few easy ingredients. This was not a $9 salad. Not even close. I could make a better vegan salad out of the produce section at Trader Joe's. It would be fresher. Would a few vegetables kill them? Seriously. Geez.   Last time I went we got a few starters - crab puffs and some hummus. I found them both alright, but they were VERY garlicky. Like major garlic. EEeks. I like garlic, but let's get real here. I got the Green burger for my meal last time. It was ok. It felt very heavy and \"gloopy\" for lack of a better word. I don't understand why they have to put the ketchup on the burger for me. So strange. I got the pasta salad as my side -- the server's suggestion as her favorite. Well, I guess if you like heavy, mayo covered stuff you are in luck.   I would go back but only for the soynami. I got the chunky monkey once and it was good.  The only upside is that I can go here and order anything without having to worry about dairy, which I am very allergic to. So, I guess that's worth something.  But in short...I've seen more veggies in a Wendy's 99 cent side salad. Seriously.  The other poster who said \"grease with a side of fat\" is dead on the money. I think I need an oil change after that tofu. :P"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. You would never even know you were not eating meat. ;)   The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is due to parking and seating issues. They really need a bigger place to accommodate the clients that go there, which says a lot for the business as well.   It is very clean and the staff there are very friendly and happy to help with any questions you may have.   I highly recommend this place for anyone vegetarian and carnivore alike."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  The soy-namis are amazing.  I'm not vegan but do crave some of their stuff periodically.  Most of the menu is great but I do not like the Mexicali Burger or the noodle bowls.  Mexicali burger is smushy and the flavors are blagh.  The noodle bowls are easy enough for me to make at home...why would I pay someone else to make them for me?"}
{"text":"Even my Dad found something to eat here!  As a vegan, I have been known to go out of my way to find tasty vegan eats, so the whole family jumped in the car and drove 40 minutes to check this place out. All in all, I was pretty happy with my Po Boy and would love to come again next time I'm in the area. I loved the free refills on the fountain drinks - four varieties to choose from including a lemonade and iced tea. All you can drink so if you don't get filled up enough with all the delicious and creative choices, you can sure fill yourself up with liquids. We also enjoyed the craft beer choices starting at $3. Thanks to Green American for sharing their love of vegan food with Phoenix."}
{"text":"An absolute favorite of mine. Yes, I'm a vegetarian, but my meat-eating husband loves it as well. Their faux chicken is absolutely amazing - Wendy's Pickle is my favorite.   People from all walks of life eat here. You don't have to be a pretentious hipster to feel comfortable or love the food!"}
{"text":"Love at first bite. Tasty through and through...unique, meatless dishes with lots of variety and great flavor. Great drink selection, nice décor. What a gem of a find in the valley. Really scored when we found Green. Can't wait to get back here for more!"}
{"text":"My so has ROE which is a rare desiese. He is allergic to eggs and fairy. He can have EVERYTHING on the menu! It's his new lil heaven and mine ;)! Right next door there is a sister restaurant that serves ice cream cake and a bunch of goodies also vegan."}
{"text":"vegan diner food, served with diner attitude, yay!   fries, burgers, fusion, tsoynamis.... they have some grocery stuff, baked goods and fancy bottled drinks for sale as well."}
{"text":"This place was packed.  Friendly service.  Very clean.  My wife had the vegan chicken salad with a lemon tahini dressing.  The fake chicken looked and tasted real.  A bit too sour for me.   I had the Thai peanut bowl.  Just the right level of heat.  Definitely the best food on our trip after my moms cooking."}
{"text":"Awesome buffalo chicken wings and great salads. Very friendly happy staff. Amazing place for anyone with food restrictions"}
{"text":"Two Words: Big Wac. Not on the online menu but they do carry it. Best veggie burger I have ever eaten in my life! It puts the Big Mac to shame, best part is no formaldehyde like at McDonalds."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in the valley - chicken wings (vegetarian) are a must have !"}
{"text":"I was here about a month ago with some vegetarian and lactose intolerant friends. The food was surprisingly good. I'd typically go without meat than eat imitation meat because seriously, what good could possibly be in something that fake? However, this time, I went with a thai peanutty veggie (non)chicken bowl with noodles. I was impressed! But I should have gotten brown rice instead of the noodles. After that, we shared a tsoynami (cute- it's their vegan milkshake thing) and the (vegan!) cookie dough in it was amazing. I'll be back eventually!"}
{"text":"I often visit the Scottsdale location and just love it, so I was excited to try the downtown location. I ordered my favorite dish: kung pao mock chicken. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It wasn't even close to as spicy as it should be and the brown rice was severely undercooked. I will definitely give it another shot, since I love the menu so much, but this particular visit was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food and a vibrant environment. The menu has a lot of good options, you would want to try all of them. The meat imitations are delicious, vegetarians can get a taste of how it feels to eat meat without actually eating one. The flavors are amazing and original. Loved my experience and will surely visit again :)"}
{"text":"I'm not used to eating vegan food, but it was pretty good for something different. Oatmeal cookie was amazing!"}
{"text":"I decided to re-write my review for Green. Since then I have been handed a plethora of new information about their menu that might make it more appealing for almost anyone.  One of my previous complaints was that besides some of their sandwiches and their salads, their food was particularly oily, or greasy, etc. I thought, this place is too good not to have some sort of alternative to this situation and guess what? There is a solution. I admit, I prematurely judged the cuisine before asking enough questions. Turns out, almost everything on the menu, especially the entrees are customizable to the point that you can almost make anything on the menu fit your preference and the staff is more than accommodating and gracious about it.   I have since had a lot of items on the menu and been able to get many items to fit my dietary preferences: sandwiches (the Wendy's Pickle is a great customizable one), almost all the bowls I have tried with less oil, steamed veggies, or light sauce, etc. The salads I have swapped out the meats for different kinds of tofu or light sauce, etc. Almost every time, my food has been delicious and if it wasn't, it was usually because my choice of customization was poor.   Not to mention, like I said in the last review, this location has great service, as do all the locations and it is clean too.   Whether a ravenous carnivore, local vegetarian vegan, out-of-towner, or whatever, I can pretty much attest to the fact that you'll more than likely find one, probably, two items on the menu to satisfy an appetite."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian but this is such a good place for good food. Usually I get the wings and sometimes I'll stop next door for a blizzard at nami. Fairly quick service and reasonable prices. It can be busy during lunches."}
{"text":"OMG!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I am a raw foodie that appreciates the time that goes into making \"REAL\" food.  I happen onto this place and now can't wait to bring my husband here soon.  Your selection is great and I can't wait to try your yogurt.  I had the veggie burger that truly was awesome!   Thank you, thank you for good health food!  Also, the staff were very friendly and helpful...very nice décor to boot! :)"}
{"text":"Better than expected. Def will return. Loved the calexico \"burger\""}
{"text":"So every weekend, my husband and I have lengthy negotiations about where we are going to eat. He is a meat lover whereas I am a vegetarian so of course we can't agree on a place to eat, plus he is allergic to snooty \"organic\" places where an ok dish costs like a million dollars and everyone pretends to like it because it is \"the\" place to be.  After reading reviews on Yelp and looking at the menu, we decided to give Green a try. I was crossing my fingers because anyway vegetarians don't have much of a choice when eating out. We ordered wings, a BBQ chicken burger and a Mexicali burger. The first wing the husband ate made him a convert; I was already in love with the food and the options and the price. The burgers were great and the fries were DELICIOUS!  We've decided to make this place one we'll frequent. Love the ambience, the quick service and everything about it. Thank goodness for Green!"}
{"text":"The food is good, service is terribly slow. Table of 5, everyone but me got their food. 25 minutes later I finally asked for a refund. Cashier and manager gave me a hard time about wanting a refund."}
{"text":"Every time my partner and I drive through Phoenix, we HAVE TO stop by Green New American for that Big WAC.  It's just phenomenal!  I wish I would try their other items, because if they're anything like that burger, I just might have to relocate to Phoenix!  (Okay,  kidding; I hate Arizona.  But that burger really does make drives from California to New Mexico and back so much more enjoyable.)"}
{"text":"WOW! I went with high expectations because of the reviews. I was not in the least disappointed. The food was absolutely amazing. To top it off the service was great as well. The girls were so friendly and inviting. Cant wait to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The food at Green was impressively similar to the things they're fakes of. I'm surprised someone said portions were large, they were quite the opposite. I can't imagine eating here often, the food definitely isn't healthy, if you eat whole plant foods, you'll be reminded for a couple days :-/. I was shocked when I asked if there were tree nuts (allergic-not deadly just painful) in anything I wanted to order, it took a while for them to find out & didn't sound sure or convincing (playing with fire). Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and it's nice for transitioning into veganism or satiating cravings if you need to."}
{"text":"OMG! Big Wac, fries, chocolate shake and chocolate tSoynami was the bomb diggity! Did not care for the buffalo chicken at all!"}
{"text":"It's easy to be vegetarian and order anything from the menu!  This place rocks my world."}
{"text":"Oh Green, how do I love thee....so much that I fantasize about salads and tsoynamis.  I've been to both the Tempe and Phoenix locations, including the cafe/bakery/sister restaurant, Nami. I am a 23 year vegetarian,  part time vegan. My SO is a Nebraska bred, meat and potatoes kinda guy. We both love Green. I'm convinced,  if you don't like Green, there's something broken in your mouth...now the important stuff... Ambience. ...hip, funky, casual, sometimes hectic...and all in a good way. Not intimidating.  No too hippy dippy. Just clean, bright, and creative. There's tons of seating inside and at the Tempe location,  a patio. The staff are 99% of the time cheerful and friendly...on one occasion we got a surly server/cashier but it wasn't bad enough to ruin our visit.  FOOOOOOOD... Well where to start..i order the Ranchero salad every time I eat here. Tender, mixed baby greens, crunchy tortilla strips, carrot shreds, creamy ranch and Green's yummy yummy barbecue \"wings\"...it's perfect. Speaking of wings...these are amazing. Meaty texture, zesty sauce and the cucumber ranch and veg that accompany it are refreshing and delicious.  This is my guy's go to. With the thyme fries...that are so crispy.... The perfect fry. We had the fries with chili once and unfortunately/fortunately we decided it wasn't for us and that I make a far meaner, and superior veggie chili. Moving on....on my very first visit I tried the Kung pao with mock chicken noodle bowl and was not a fan. Watery, too sweet, too salty yet bland sauce, slightly too al dente noodles...it just wasn't what I expected.  We also split a  Wendy's pickle. It's a mock fried chicken cutlet with pickle and spicy vegan mayo. It was warm and soft and tastes so much like chicken I was slightly scared it was real..on subsequent visits, we tried the 'thee argentine poboy\"...grilled mock steak and caramelized peppers and onions with mayo and a spicy sauce. The steak had crispy bits, tender bits and was so flavorful. I would've loved more vegetables. ..there were 2 pieces of pepper on the whole sandwich. .but the part that stands out the most, oddly enough was...the bun. The fluffiest, most perfect bun ever. I want every sandwich I eat to be on that bun. We also ate the BBBQ bacon burger. Veggie patty, portabella cap, bacon, bbq sauce,  mushrooms onions and mayo. This burger was so rich and delicious and big.  We split it and I couldn't finish my half. Green also offers daily, off - menu, specials. We got a Carne asada nachos, which were ok. Tasty, but not enough carne, and too many dry chips. The most recent special I tried was a rueben sandwich.  The sandwich was huge! Tons of Seiten steak, thousand island, vegan cheese and sauerkraut on rye. It came with fries, (you can get fruit, fries, coleslaw). Very tasty. My only beef is with the price tag. Both specials I tried were $12 which is $3+ more than the regular menu  items. Which isn't a lot by any means...but the specials i tried weren't Green's best dishes..  At Green you can get water, or one of their delicious, refreshing drinks...lime, berry lemonade, iced tea, and vimto. I have no idea what vimto is..maybe it's vitmo..anyway..i don't know what it is, but I know it's red, mildly sweet and delicious. There's also some bottled kombucha, boxed water, other bottled juices as well as beer! on tap. Local favorites from 4 peaks brewery and more. And super reasonably priced. . $3 for a kiltlifter.    If by some chance you have any room left, do yourself a favor and get dessert. The s'mores tsoynami is so good. Creamy soft serve, chocolate, graham crumbs and rice fluff...soo goey. Ive had a lemon ginger tsoynami as well and it was scrumptious. You can buy pastries and other goodies too including take and bake cookies. And the desserts are reasonably priced too. Seriously. . $4.50 for a huge tsoynami.  Suck it DQ.    I almost forgot! Nami does sunday brunch and Monday through Friday breakfast and Green frequently holds special dinners...a carnivore conversion dinner, holiday meals..and Green and Nami cater.     I also wanted to mention a few details...   Ordering is done at a counter. You're given a number and a server brings you your food. You clear your own table. There are condiments like hot sauce and tamari available. The kitchen tries to use organic whenever possible.  Long review short..i love Green.  It's delicious, vegan comfort food. Not even \"comfort food\". It's the food you, as a vegetarian,  dream about finding on the menu at a restaurant. No more crappy side salad and fries! No more frozen, did they cook this on the meat grill, veggie burgers! Enough of me typing...You should just go and love it too."}
{"text":"Good option for vegans and vegetarians. Most of our dishes tasted good. Some were average but would like to come back and try more."}
{"text":"I go for the soynomi and the fries thats about it.  My friend is a vegan and she tell me to try the best stuff on the menu.  So far I had one sandwich with fake chicken with BBQ that was pretty good.    However, everything else just made me want to go get chipotle.  This place just is not for me.    This place is good for vegans and non vegans that want to try it and decide for themselves, but mostly just vegans.   I will give it 3 stars for me and 4 for the vegans, according to a lot of the veggie mites its one of the best places to go.  Recommendation: Vegans and people who like soy ice cream, but nothing to go out of your way to get."}
{"text":"Just had a dough boy soynami for the first time and it was really good. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting family in Fountain Hills. So worth the drive! My non-vegan kids even loved it too. We all ordered something different, but the Big WAC was the table favorite. Amazing fries! The fountain drinks were waaaay too sweet, we all agreed, but they have an awesome selection of refrigerated drinks. The buns on the non-burger sandwiches were a little too \"bready\" with no flavor, but that was the only food downside. All in all, a fantastic place. Wish there was something like it back home in Michigan!"}
{"text":"We've gone here a lot the past couple months, and I have to say that they have really stepped it up! The Argentine Po'boy is a favorite of a lot of people here (including me!) but if there's a special I have to try it, and it's usually amazing. The Citrus Chicken sandwich was sooo good. I can't wait until they have it again! Also, my boss NEVER eats fries but she has to get the thyme fries every time we go here because they are awesome and perfect even for takeout. I'm really happy! It's a favorite of ours now!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times during business travel. The first time I wasn't impressed, but I don't remember what I ordered. The next two times I had the Kung Pao with fresh tofu. Excellent! And I love that you can ask to make any dish spicy. If I get to return to Phoenix I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"When I traveled to Phoenix to visit a friend I expected little to no vegan restaurants. Green blew me away. First of all, vegan soft serve - I had the \"Betterfinger\" with chik-o-stick candy and chocolate chips, yum.  Also tried the Wendy's chicken sandwich with their fries and that was delicious too! The atmosphere was great, the staff was really friendly and it hits all those vegan cravings!"}
{"text":"Th Green New American is another of our favorite vegan restaurants. We love to go there for their Big Wac burger. They also serve beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks as well."}
{"text":"Based off of the reviews we were anxious to try this place out. We just recently ordered their \"ThanksLiving\" holiday meal, which was good. My review about the food is like everyone else overall. We were most disappointed in the service. I can always appreciate when an explanation is given to a first timer, who doesn't know how they run the restaurant. None was given, fine. So we leave a tab open after ordering apps because we wanted to eat as we went and didn't know what to expect for four people. You basically have to expect a do-it-yourself type service. The two front of house people were rude and short with us. The blonde female seemed as if she was having a terrible day and it rubbed off on the rest of the staff. I asked where I could park my grandpa's walker and I suggested an empty corner and she said no, that I should keep it at the table. That has never happened. We asked for side plates and got rolled eyes. The poor service alone definitely discourages us ever returning."}
{"text":"We found this on our way to the airport. The food was delicious and fresh. I had Thee Green Salad which had Hearts of Palm, greens, tomatoes, etc. with a tasty dressing and the Samosas as recommended by the waitress...delicious and unique flavor.  It is a treat to find good, fresh, delicious food while travelling."}
{"text":"The resturant has a nice ambiance and the food is pretty good...I'm not vegan, but I do try to make vegetarian choices as often as possible. I have to say though, I was pretty disappointed with the salad I had and the Po-Boy sandwhich with barbeque and mushrooms was just ok for me. I have heard from friends that the mexi-cali burger is good so I'm going to give it another shot! Their mock chicken is very good though I like the kung-pao bowl."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a few months now. First time I tried their food, instantly became obsessed! Literally would drive almost an hour away just to eat here. The food is seriously amazing. Today, however, I found not one, BUT TWO hairs in my food. I was already disgusted with the first hair but decided I was just going to pretend it didn't happen and just continue to eat my food anyway (which was SO HARD TO DO). But then when I found the second hair, I immediately felt like I was going to throw up and just got my things and left. This unfortunately ruined my experience here, which sucks because I loved it so much. I will not be coming back and that makes me super sad :("}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Green since there aren't very many vegan restaurants around the Valley.  Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed!  Because so many people in reviews raved about the hot wings we decided we had to give them a try.  We neither one could eat them, they were hard and dry with very little taste to them.  We also tried the eggless rolls which were ok however very greasy.  We were surprised to have the BBQ bacon burger that we shared come out with a white bun instead of whole wheat.  I don't understand why the Chef/Owner quit with the healthy aspect of a vegetarian/vegan menu and put in a processed white flour bun!  I realize there are vegans who do eat gluten products, however there are those of us who prefer to eat gluten free.  I have never written a bad reveiw of a restaurant before so I feel very bad about this, but I felt I needed to."}
{"text":"A friend reviewed this as \" I like it, the hot wings dont have any tendons.\"   I've had almost everything at this place. It's pretty good. Bruh, let me tell you about the \"icecream\" this shit is fucking fabulous. So, I'm assuming this slice of heaven is aome sort of soymilk frozen yumminess. Not too sure and I don't really care. If it was frozen gasoline I'd eat that. Fuck yeah. Anyway, my favorite right; is called a fucking Fluffernutter. Keep your jiz jokes to youtube kiddos. This is delish. They take that weird soyicenotcream deal, mix that shit with some ricemellow. Which is fucking glorious. You with me still? So ricemellow... Then peanut butter. I love peanut butter. Also, youtube commenters go back to your shadows. Then you add some bananas. Bruh. Bananas, ricemellow and peanut butter. This shit tastes like moonpies. Not sure if y'all remember them, but dude. Amazing. I personally like to order twice that ricefluff shiznat and then add in some chocolate saaauce. Orgy in yourmotherfuckingmouth.   There ya go yelp. Since my original post was too short; have my real opinion."}
{"text":"The staff at Green are so much fun. We enjoy interacting with them when we order and they make going out to eat a very enjoyable experience. They have delicious food and desserts are incredible. You forget you are eating vegan! It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"After a long morning of hiking, and an afternoon of volunteering it was music to my ears when my carnivorous father suggested a vegan restaurant for dinner. I was stoked to discover he not only enjoyed the food, but would go back for seconds! Good service, clean place, delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"Green is one of my favorites. If you are vegan or gluten free, this is the place for you. If you like to eat health and delicious food, this is it. There is a huge menu for everyone.  My favorite is the green salad with avocado. Enjoy a dish. And then you can go next door to Nami and have a dessert."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  its vegetarian and offers some vegan  i am a pescetarian by the way, don't eat meat except fish,  now ill just list what I've had and what i think of it all....   spicy buffalo \"wings\"- delicious, like the best, and to me it tastes like real chicken   chili fries- good but i didn't like it that much, lots of chili on them, i prefer their thyme fries (considered their regular fries)   crab puffs- they're pretty good, to me nothing fantastic but they don't suck either so they're just good   egglessrolls- i cant remember if i loved these or just liked them? But from what i remember they were good   samosas- this was the first time i had samosas and i thought they were ok, i personally didn't like them that much   i haven't had any of their salads or pizzas for myself   orcciette pasta- i really didn't like this that much, to much onion, But they tend to make things differently sometimes so maybe it just wasn't a good day for me And i got the chicken so maybe the meatballs would have been better   Thai peanut- this is my absolute FAVorite dish!!!! With mock chicken and noodles, its just so delicious. If you don't like peanut sauce though it might not be for you, even though i didn't originally think id like it, so hey you should just try it.   the original 'g' spicy po-boy - really good, its just the chicken wings but in a sandwich and bigger pieces of it in it hah its really good though   no harm chicken parm sandwich- from what i remember this was good   I've tried several variations of the soft serves and the tsoynami, and every one I've tried yet is delicious!    Hope you like it if you try it! haha,  Here's the link:   http://www.greenvegetarian.com/"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. I was on vacation in Phoenix and randomly found this place by googling vegetarian restaurants and I was completely blown away. The food is top notch.  For an appetizer I had the buffalo wings and they were a perfect combination of spicy and savory.  I also had the the secret BBQ chicken sandwich and it was probably the best vegetarian chicken sandwich I've ever had. Being from NYC I've been to many vegan/vegetarian restaurants and I can honestly say without any hyperbole that this place is better than any place in NYC.   Do yourself a favor and go to this place now!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this restaurant or justify coming here anymore based on the increase in prices.  Food is good but I would rather skip for the price.    Green isn't on my radar anymore."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars, but I've tried everything on the menu and to me it's like fast food for vegans.  I'm not a big fast food person to begin with.   I only really enjoy the crab puffs and the pizza minus the faux cheese.   For a while there I was going about every three weeks, but eventually just stopped going.  All of the food has a weird texture to me and I have a hard time swallowing some of it.  Oh and I really like the chocolate peanut butter thing...  The service was always just mediocre.  The decor inside is pretty neat."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup about 5 minutes before they closed, and asked if we could eat the food for dine in.  Yea i was that guy...but they accommodated with a positive attitude.    They used to put their noodle and rice bowls in small boxes, but they were served in big ones.  I think this is a good move, as its hard to eat out of the little ones if you're using the box.  The food is always delicious, but the quality of food, and how it was made tonight seemed way better than our previous visit.  Seems like they put continuous care into their restaurant."}
{"text":"Love. This. Place.  Maybe it's because vegetarians are high and dry in the desert to find someplace to eat.  But I really think the food is good. I've had the green burger, thyme fries, curry pasta salad, several of the bowls, 4 different kinds of tsoynamis, a peanut butter chocolate bar, a strawberry milkshake, and a mooshroom po' boy. All good.  The po' boy was a little hard to eat - very messy, but tasty nonetheless (it's supposed to be messy, right?). The burger is a reddish color (they must use beet juice) and tastes like grains and savoriness and is texturally soft and pleasing, on a nice big bun with all the right fixins. Thyme fries could use a little more thyme, but the fries themselves were quite good. Tsoynamis and milkshakes are AMAZING. Bowls with noodles and fried tofu are great. Thai peanut = win.  It has a nice, diverse menu - can't wait to try out some of the appetizers :)  One thing I didn't like was that there was a lot of \"fake meat\" on the menu - fake chicken, fake beef, etc. I'm not into the fake meat so much, give me something homemade or tofu any day. Fortunately, there was plenty of that too, and some people like fake meat, so who am I to judge?  Star for really friendly staff, star for delicious ice cream, star for fabulous mostly-from-scratch vegan food, star for having so many things to choose from, and star for carrying Maine root beer!!! AAAH MY FAVORITE!"}
{"text":"Disappointing overcooked tofu cubes.  Food did not appear or taste fresh.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Seemed like a typical Scottsdale $10 lunch at first, but not after I started eating.  This is good wholesome food, not overcooked/over-sauced restaurant food.  I got the madras curry bowl with extra roasted vegetables which was packed with broccoli especially.  This is a rare occasion that I feel almost better eating out as I would if cooking at home.  Good amount of sauce to flavor the dish but not overdo it.  Also, I've missed ice cream since becoming sensitive to dairy and a small sample of the soy swirl ice cream really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, the food is just that good! I'm always down to come here for a bite to eat because the food is always delicious and consistent. It's also a pretty big plus it's right across the street from where I live. I admit, I was a little iffy to try some of the things on the menu, however, I was never let down."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Green for a few years now, so I've had most of the items on the menu.  My favorite is the Calexico with fries.  On this trip, we got the artichoke dip app.  It wasn't my favorite thing, so I'll stick with the wings, which are FANTASTIC! Their fries are shoestring and have yet to disappoint.  This is the perfect place for vegans and meat eaters alike!  Give their brunch a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good vegan food overall. My favorite is the big wac, the vegan version of the big mac. Love the vegan soft serve they sell too."}
{"text":"I'm no where near being a vegan, but I stopped in with some true vegan regulars. I ordered one of their burgers that was made with garbanzo beans, spices and vegan-mayo and a side of fries. The burger and fries were delicious (couldn't even tell fries were not fried in animal fat). Most importantly, everyone walked away totally stuffed (this is important for us meat eaters).   The only problem I had was there seemed to be something missing about the burger. Its really only sauce and patti. Even if it was a meat pattii it wouldn't be right. It needs a little something more so that Its not just a simple flavor."}
{"text":"Wow excellent food and service!  Great vibe nice people  and the air conditioner rocks!  We had the Big Whac, fries,  dagobah jungle salad,  buffalo wings and peach cobbler tsoynami.  They are all delicious."}
{"text":"So happy to have this restaurant in my neighborhood. It is my go-to place for excellent vegetarian meals."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I am not a vegetarian, vegan, or hipster.  What the hell am I doing at Green?  Eating really friggin' tasty food, that's what!  This Green location is very airy and pleasant.  On nice days the garage door in front is opened up so the whole restaurant seems like a patio.  The staff are friendly and orders come up in a timely manner.  The parking lot is quite tiny so sometimes it's tough to find a space, but it's worth the wait!    Today for lunch I tried the ranchero salad.  The salad features Green's famed \"wings,\" which I learned today are made from mock beef, not mock chicken.  The restaurant happened to be out of the \"beef,\"  and I was asked if \"chicken\" would be okay.  Silly me thought that wings would be made of faux chicken anyway!  I'm not sure what they taste like when made with \"beef\" but I really enjoyed the \"chicken\" version.  The salad also has a vegan version of ranch dressing which sort of tasted pesto-y to me, but was cool and refreshing just like non-vegan ranch but without that heavy, artery-clogging feeling.  Yum!  I've also had tried the secret BBQ chicken sandwich.  This seems to be quite a popular item, but I thought the \"chicken\" in this dish was chewy and hard to bite through.  The sandwich was also messy to eat because it had tons of sauce on it.  The sauce is fantastic though.  Just get lots of napkins.  I particularly like the Green burger and addictive thyme fries.  The apricot miso noodle bowl really surprised me.  Lots of sweet and subtle flavors.  Green is an excellent place to come for a late afternoon lunch.  I think even people who are hardcore carnivores can find something to enjoy here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. I got the Thai peanut bowl with brown rice and mock chicken. It was incredibly delicious, actually. I was very pleasantly surprised. Wish I lived closer! Very impressed."}
{"text":"Nummy nummy in my tummy! Walked over with hubby from Nami, since it is next door. Split Cajun chicken sliders and loved it. Split the Big Wac and loved it. Complimented both dishes with fries that we shared together. Everything was rich in flavor. Left fulling full and light because of the ingredients. Well done."}
{"text":"I love, love, love GREENS!  I ate there today after seeing the reviews on Yelp!  I'm a MEAT eater, but I enjoyed the Vegan dishes here. The  bottled drinks are sort of expensive though, but then again I think they are made with Stevia."}
{"text":"Not quite as amazing as it used to be - or maybe I've been here too many times and the luster has worn off.  No longer get sides with the sandwiches either and prices have gone up.  I do want to try their new in-n-out substitute animal fries though for sure.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this place, its just no longer close to 5star territory for me anymore."}
{"text":"I was hungry and decided to try out the Green in Tempe because my experience at the one in Phoenix was a long time ago, but very good from the memories I recalled.   We drove and found parking (slightly tight, because this place is busy and there are spots but not too many of them lying around) and proceeded to head in.  It was about 2:30PM at this point, so I assumed it would be settled down after a lunch rush. No such thing. This place was full, busy, and still churning out food like it never had been slow to begin with. That is a great start in my books.  We (I dragged my fella in tow for this stop) headed up to the counter and grabbed a menu and looked through what to get. When the line moved up and it was our turn we ordered, paid, and took a number to place on a table of our choosing. The staff was pleasant, although fairly quiet, but they moved us along politely and we waited.  While waiting for the food, we bought beverages which you can either grab from their fridge, or choose from 4 refillable drinks. We choose the refillable drinks and chugged away.  Green Tea (strong, deep flavor), Lemonade (mild lemon taste, not a ton of sugar), Limeade with Ginger (lime was a good taste, could not taste ginger), and I believe it is called Virmto (a medium weight beverage tasting like cherries, weirdly addicting, you should have a taste)  They bring our food and it was filling and just enough for lunch.  Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\" ($5.00) For those that don't like spice this was not too bad. It had more components of vinegar to the spice than actual heat. The \"wings\" were great soy chicken substitutes and I did not miss actual chicken in this. If the tartness of these is too much then go ahead and dunk them in the Vegan Cucumber Ranch that comes with it. It was some yummy ranch!  Artichoke Chicken Salad ($6.00/$9/00) We ended up getting the small salad and that was plenty for him and I to split. There was a Lemon-Tahini dressing that brightened up the greens very well, the salad leaves were dark & crisp, big pieces of artichoke strewn throughout the salad, and again the soy chicken was fantastic. You can tell it is fake with further inspection, regardless it still tastes fantastic (this was also prepared differently than the wings, it was a longer flat pieces where the wings were more like clusters of soy chicken).    Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich ($8.50) The chicken is prepared the same way in this sandwich as it was in the salad. The BBQ sauce had a tiny (I mean tiny) kick to it and was slightly messy to eat. Prepare for a burger stance with this one (elbows kicked out, looming over the sandwich aggressively). The Tahini Cole-Slaw was good, but had a lot of tahini and peanuts which overpowered the cabbage for me. The downside to the sandwich was the bun. The bun was a plain burger bun that was slightly stale and not that flavorable. The dryness of the bun against the sticky bbq sauce made a consistency that liked to get stuck in my mouth. Not the classiest thing to fix in front of other people, mind you.  With eating this food there were people that continued to come and go from the building non stop. The atmosphere is a bit hipster (staff was polite, but other guests really liked themselves and it was obvious) though I saw many suits, parents, and bros hanging out. Good melting pot!  Overall I think this place had great food, cheap prices, manageable crowds, and I could go back easily to try more items. Stay tuned, I need to go get a Tsoynami.  Cheers,  Messy Papers."}
{"text":"Green used to be okay. A quick stop to eat something unhealthy, but a vegan comfort food in Phoenix.  I went there recently and the menu changed. The prices all went up if you include a side. I ordered a bowl and got barely any food. It is ridiculous.  I am not going back there again."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian who is also allergic to dairy.  If you have an allergy, you understand how annoying it is to go out to eat places.  With Green, I don't have to worry about this.  The best part is, the food is amazing!!! I literally crave this place at least 4 times a week.  If you go, you must try the fake chx - I think I am addicted. I should honestly go to FCAA (Fake Chx Addiction Anonymous).  Don't forget to top the meal off with a tSoynami - absolutely TO DIE FOR!  Thank you Damon for creating such amazing food.  One complaint... BE OPEN ON SUNDAYS :D"}
{"text":"Totally love: the mini drink bar, Ranchero salad, clean bathrooms with Meyers soap, awesome decor, friendly staff Could probably do without the exorbitant amount of grease most of the dishes offer. To be honest, I find this place to be primarily junk food status... But what girl doesn't need a little junk food love in her life? Luckily for my waistline I live a good distance from here."}
{"text":"Everything I've had is great. I work next door so I am frequently in there. Right now, I'm obsessed with the Big Wac. Unreal how good this 'burger' is.  The texture and flavor is spot on, but far better than an actual Big Mac. I actually feel better with more energy when I eat here."}
{"text":"Although a huge fan of bloody food. I have to say, Green is really damn good. As a former cook at Spiral Diner, I always checked out veg joints in other states, and rarely liked any of it. Green is great. even the faux meat dishes, which are usually the least impressive. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"100% vegan, 90% awesome.    I've been to Green several times is the last few months, as I've traveled to and through Phoenix, and I have really liked everything... except that I wish they went easier with the salt on some of the dishes.  Maybe Green thinks non-vegans will find vegan food more flavorful with lots of salt, and of course salt does magnify flavors, but they just use too much of it.  It's the burgers especially that I feel are too salty (I've had the Calexico burger and the BBBQ bacon burger).  Tip: you get a choice of 4 fake meats in the bowls, and of the 2 I've tried (mock chicken and house tofu), the house tofu was the star.  Nice flavor (just a tad too salty) and chew.  Also, the tahini coleslaw that comes with the burgers is excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I wish they'd put one where I live. It tastes like \"normal\" food, but better."}
{"text":"Fuckin delicious. I've tried several of their menu items and each time I end up making that \"holy Toledo this is awesome face\" that foodies are all guilty of. You know, the one where you close your eyes and moan a little? It's embarrassing but toooootally worth it. The Tsoynamis are rad and way better than ice cream. And the staff is super sweet! My only complaint is that it's rather stealthily hidden, or maybe my sense of direction is just lacking.   That's all I got. Vegans, vegetarians, meat-eaters...everyone should eat here."}
{"text":"amazing veggie-grain burger! my favorite place for fries the barbecue 'faux' chicken burger is so damn good.... the sauce in incredible! yum"}
{"text":"i'm all about the argentine po'boy and the the mock buffalo chicken.  i've sampled some other stuff on the menu, and so far, those are definitely my favorites.  the fries rock, too.  to me, this place is indulgence food.  i doubt it's all that healthy, though i haven't really looked for nutritional info on the menu.  it's an occasional greasy pit stop, and i'm glad green's there for that.  not a big fan of the tsoynami's, but they're worth a shot to see if you like them.  the entire menu is priced great, the atmosphere's laid back, the staff is friendly and efficient, and it seems fairly clean.  these guys have a corner on the market for what they're doing and it shows -- every time i've gone in, it has been pretty busy with a steady stream of customers coming and going.  green's the new black...i suspect it's going to get more and more popular.  i'm hoping for a tempe location some time soon."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  It is usually very busy and loud inside but I try to see that as part of the atmosphere and a good thing because it means more people are eating cruelty free.  I usually stick with the same order because I am easy that way but my mate usually gets whatever the special is for the day and hasn't had a bad thing to say about ant of them.  And despite how big then portions and plates are, don't forget to save room for desert and check out Nami sweets next door!"}
{"text":"good food and good atmosphere most of the time.  my only complaint is sometimes the staff are rude, they look at you like they wonder why you are in there place...to eat you jerks!"}
{"text":"Green, I'm so glad you've opened up a midtown location.   In college, when I lived in Tempe, I'd frequent green very regularly. After I graduated and moved downtown, I'd drive myself over to the Scottsdale Rd. location as often as possible for the sweet and sour bowl, the smores tsoynami, and whatever yummy baked goods were fresh that day.   So here's the scoop, for all of you soon-to-be enthusiasts.   Green serves 100% vegan food. That means no dairy, eggs, gelatin, etc. However, their food isn't 'healthy'. That's not a dig-they do casual, 'comfort'-style vegan food that you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish as being vegan.  With mac and cheese, burgers, rice/noodle bowls, salads, buffalo wings, etc, green has a little something for just about any craving.   After your meal, go next door to their joint dessert/coffee bar and snag yourself a tsoynami. Just. Do. It.   The (few) downsides-   They changed their menu a few months ago, and I was pretty bummed-some of the items that I loved and ordered regularly throughout the years were replaced. I was kind of disappointed when they first rolled out some of the new items, but it's definitely gotten MUCH better/consistent.   I've gone with a few non-vegan/vegetarian friends, and while all of them have been pleasantly surprised with the food they've ordered, sometimes the staff hasn't been too keen on explaining things, making substitutions, etc. That's kind of a bummer. I feel like it's improved, though, and the Phoenix location feels less hipstery-'cliquey' than the green I first encountered five or six years ago.   It's downtown. Parking is limited and tight. Carpool!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The reason for 3 stars is because I'm OK with a vegan meal... but this fake meat stuff is a bit strange and vegan meals are NOT always healthy. The dip that we shared turned out to be very fatty.   I agree with the other reviews that state that if you're going to be a vegan stop having so much meat envy. Why this fake meat? Just eat tofu and alot of vegetables.   Overall the food was good and the atmosphere is quirky but I was really disappointed that the vegan meal we had wasn't as healthy as I thought it woul be."}
{"text":"Last time coming here. Everything on the new menu is pricy and I got a burned disgusting salad today. Had to drive back in the hottest day to return it. The cashier seemed indifferent and tried to make me believe the sprouts that looked like meatball were only \"a little bit fried\". Excuse me? My entire office noticed the burning smell when I opened the box. I used to love this place... So mad and so sad."}
{"text":"If you are a full-time vegan who misses meat, I think Green adds welcome variety to your diet. If you prefer Middle Eastern, Indian, or \"hippie\" vegetarian/vegan, you will probably not like Green too much as their menu is largely vegan-ized items (they use mock meats and cheeses to create burgers, chicken wings, and the like) with heavy use of salty sauces, vegan mayo, and deep frying.  The service and atmosphere are decent for any fast casual eatery and the place is clean as a can be. I've been many times, but the time between my visits is increasing each time.  Please don't mistake the the words \"vegan\", \"organic\", \"natural\", etc. for \"healthy\". Green certainly has healthy items on their menu, but they also have tons of deep fried choices and something like half their menu is slathered in a rainbow of salty sauces."}
{"text":"Great/cool/semi-chill atmosphere. Very clean. The staff was consistently wiping the tables clean. Average noise level. Large assortment of options on the menu. Menu is perfectly priced. I appreciate how you order at the counter (do not need to give a tip). I had the Big Wac. It was great. When I come back I want to try one of their salads. They looked awesome."}
{"text":"Green is probably the best vegan restaurant in all of Arizona. The tsoynamis are AMAZING and their vegan \"Ranch\" dressing is the best I have ever had!! Most of the time when I go the lines are kind of long, but not too bad, Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm mmm mm mm. Who would've known that vegetarian food could taste so incredible? Not only incredible but I'm convinced the mock chicken is not mock at all but rather real chicken! Coming from someone who loves their meat that's saying a lot! The texture is like actual chicken. If someone brought me this mock chicken and told me it was chicken I would completely believe them because it tastes so real. The first time I made the mistake of ordering the crispy tofu. Oh it was a long line but *make sure to get a menu to look at while waiting in line*. It took me longer than the long line took to decide what to get. Make it easy on yourself and order mock chicken! Also make sure you get the correct menu (grain free or not). Don't bother with the tofu or anything other than the mock chicken! I had the mock chicken in the buffalo chicken wings. Mmm mmm mm! I wish I ordered that as my main dish. I said it was better than any real chicken I had at a restaurant (I may have to go back again and try it to re-confirm this outlandish idea). On top of that I got a cup for a drink. Not only do they have the regular soda machine but they have 3 of their homemade drinks. I had their cherry soda with their green tea. Mmm mm good! The cherry soda is like nothing I've tasted. Mmm good! I got the soynami on top of that. That was actually the only disappointing thing about this restaurant. I got the ginger snap soynami but it had vanilla cookie pieces and tasted nothing like ginger snaps. The second time I went there I had the mint oreo soynami very good! Overall extremely surprising over-the-moon in flavor restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am always searching for healthy gf places my son can enjoy. I went into Green with my mom, brother (anti vegetarian) & 6 year old for lunch. One word: AMAZING. They acommodated gf everything for a vegan gf \"burger\" & fries for my kid! Anti vegetarian bro couldn't tell difference in \"beef\" diablo bowl (ha, I win). I will surely be back again and again, yum!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant- reminded me of being back in college, and maybe that's because of all the college students in the place. That, and there is no waitstaff- just stand in line to order and someone will bring the food out to you.  The atmosphere didn't make me feel super comfortable- I'm not sure why. Next time I will probably order take out.   Artichoke Gratine. Remember that. Cheesy and creamy and just a touch spicy. The crab puffs were also a huge hit. I wouldn't have known the difference between the real thing and this dish.  The majority of people in the restaurant were eating a yummy-looking milkshake/sundae concoction, but I never found out what it was. Next time I come back, I'll have to try one."}
{"text":"The food was very good and there were lots of options. The garden burger was great.  Probably the best vegetarian in the valley"}
{"text":"Green is the bomb!   I would list what is good, but that would be everything i have ever eaten there.  I wish there was one in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love going to green.  Today I went alone to get my fix and ate on the patio.  I had my favorite item on the menu...the Green Buger.  Always tasty and delicious.  The thyme fries are also wonderful.  My only complaint is they switched the teas and did not have the tamarindo tea today.  I tried the new one and it was too sweet like fruit punch.  Any person should try green vegan, vegeterian or not."}
{"text":"YUM! Some of the best buffalo \"wings\" I've ever had! We got the \"No Harm No Parm\" and \"Secret BBQ Chicken\" Sandwiches. Everything was delicious! Even though I was getting full, I HAD to finish!  Also, they have awesome restrooms.. I don't think I've ever commented on this before, but their's were really nice."}
{"text":"Oh Green! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...  1. You are 100% vegan. I have a plethora of choices to eat from and not have to worry about what its made with and if its vegan or not.   2. Tsoynamis. Nuf' said.  3. Vegan crab puffs!!!  4. You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever.   5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year.   6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever.   7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close.   8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can.   There are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First, it must be understood that this is a review for the Tempe location (which is pretty much in the southern tip of Scottsdale but that isn't here and it isn't there either) that has been newly remodeled. I will not speak in length of the old décor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at Green. I won't talk about the recycled material art that lined the South wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and VW hubcaps. I also won't talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve. I also won't mention the antique Piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it, it's modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the Saloons that once occupied the desert space where Green now lies, yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying \" Please Do Not Play Piano\". I also won't talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights you'd get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still. . . no buns on the back please.   I will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of Hitchcock's direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entrée or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory post-dinner Tsoynami. The caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage, which to give credit to the designer might be the intent. The subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of Peter Signer's breakthrough work, Animal Liberation, eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak po'boy (except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage*). The vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four, but typically six, partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight, frail and eager to show they don't mind a little contact.  The alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff. A \"powerclash\" in true form. If you disregard their post-Juno fashion choices you see some of the nicest, under-tipped, funny people in the local service industry. Calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too. I've frequented this location for 5 years and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Secret BBQ \"Chicken\" sandwich is at the top of the charts but if not that then the Argentine Po'boy is a fine choice as well. Hands down one of my favorite places in the Valley.  Here's a Tip: don't be a dummy, add Chai to your Tsoynami.  *I have no idea how the kitchen staff is compensated."}
{"text":"Green Is amaze balls!  The decor is attractive, the tunes are great and the peeps are cool.  The food is plenty to rave about. It's only my second visit here and I just want more Green!   The sweet potato tots, I recommend it. Want fresh air? Bring your pup, there a cute little patio area."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious!! Couldnt even tell it wasnt real meat! I ordered the \"Big Wac\" with side of thyme fries! Super good!! I couldnt taste any thyme in the fries but burger was great! Also ordered wings, again couldnt even tell it wasnt real chicken and their buffalo sauce and ranch were really good!  Only reason I am rating 4/5 stars is because servers/employees did not clean/wipe down table. Our table was full of crumbs, also saw a table next to mine, server picked up all plates and never wiped it before next group arrived."}
{"text":"This place saved my life while I was in Phoenix last weekend. It's hard being on vacation with people who are not Veggie or Vegan. I was able to escape twice and enjoy Green.  The Big WAC is a must try! And make sure you save room for dessert next door at Nami."}
{"text":"This was my first time there as I was visiting Phoenix on travel.  We ordered the Spicy Buffalo Wings and the Samosas for appetizers.  Thai Peanut Bowl and the Singapore Orange Bowl for food on recommendation of the cashier.  Very excited to be there and I tipped the cashier nicely upon ordering because she was so helpful with menu recommendations.  I'm not sure what was wrong with the kitchen, but the Spicy Buffalo Wings and the Singapore Orange Bowl were unexpectedly very seriously oversalty, to the point of inedibility.  The other two items were quite excellent, the samosas were crispy and fluffy, and the Thai Peanut Bowl was very good, so I think the other people's five star ratings are probably spot on for their dishes.  I'd forgive them the inedible dishes, except when my companion complained about the oversalty dishes, our complaints were treated quite poorly.  My companion then asked for some rice to cut the salt, but were told we would have to buy extra rice, which my companion did... it did not help.  I asked that at least the chef be informed or that someone check our complaints..., no one.   Maybe it was the cashier, I'm not sure; I felt that our complaints were not taken seriously, and we did not finish the inedible (oversalted) portions of the meal and I left hungry.  While I would understand why people go there, it was an unsatisfying, and the complaint service was seriously lacking."}
{"text":"i haven't been here for a while because i live so far away. if i lived closer, i'd be spending more money at this establishment because it is the best vegan restaurant i've been to in phoenix.  i guess i'll start out with the most 'okay' thing i got, which was the 'po boy.' i didn't love it, but it wasn't gross...just reminded me more of 70's style vegetarian food.  i used to be vegan, and missed pizza greatly. the pizza i ate here when my tastebuds were still vegan-oriented, told me that the pizza was good, though i still haven't had vegan pizza that supasses a pizza with real cheese on it.  i ordered a salad here once, but unfotunately i can't remember what type of salad. what i can remember is that i liked it and that it tasted fresh. nothing worse than old salad greens, which this did not have.  the hummus is rich and has a nice touch of chipotle and they don't make it as gross as some other places do. i mean, when non-mediterranean/non-middle eastern restaurants make hummus, for some reason they usually go out of their way to make it as unhummus-like and unappealing as possible. this hummus isn't exactly like that found in a mediterranean restaurant, but the direction that it veers off the standard hummus path is a tasty direction, not a pointlessly nauseating one.  the buffalo wings are salty but flavorful and i love the vegan ranch dressing that comes with them. i've tried to make it at home and haven't quite figured out how they make the dressing so good. i wish there was a Green cookbook to help me out with this one.  the tsoynamis make perfect vegan junk food. just like dairy queen minus the cow ice cream or whatever dairy queen uses. i also enjoyed a chocolate peanutbutter bar here once or twice.  i wouldn't call green 'healthy', but it is tasty. the few people i've brought here (all omnivores) enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"trying vegetarian food for the first time? green is the place to go. they have a lot of fake meat products which can make it easy for guests to want to try the food. but let me tell you, you can't really go wrong with the menu. all the food is delicious, ESPECIALLY the wings and the chili fries. they also have tsoynami desserts and fresh made cookies. if the oatmeal creme pie cookies are there, buy one for $4... it's giant and worth it. the service is also pretty fast and the staff is very nice. the parking lot is not the biggest, but you can usually find a space easily."}
{"text":"So just in case this is the first review you've read about this place, let me be the one to tell you - it's vegan. Not vegetarian (no meat, but eggs and dairy), but vegan. And several of their dishes are mock - made to resemble normal meat dishes (hot dogs, burgers, chicken, etc.). I know that right there either turns people on or off. Me, I dig it. My freezer's stocked with Boca, Morning Star, Quorn and Gardenburger products. That said, not all of their mock products work. While I love heir Spicy Buffalo Wings, Crab Puffs, Vegan Chili Fries and Mum's Meatball Po-boy, I was disappointed with the No Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich and the Vegan Hot Dogs. Haven't built up the courage to try their pizzas just yet - my previous experience with vegan cheese hasn't been all that great. But I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually, I stop by for lunch with my meat-eating friends at least once a month. But don't worry, mock isn't all they have to offer. They've also got tofu - a Spicy Peanut Tofu appetizer as well as a good variety of noodle and rice bowls.  And it's a pretty cool place - I really dig the decor, from the Volkswagen doors along an entire wall to the local art work."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but i like eating healthy. The food here is good for vegetarian food. I usually just get one of there veggie burgers, but I don't like the fake cheese. I think it is daiya cheese. I need to make sure I don't get it next time. It's a bit pricey, but fake healthy food is expensive. If you are a vegetarian you'd love this place, but I still like eating meat so this place is just OK for me."}
{"text":"Had I known that eating vegan could be this delicious I would have stopped eating meat a long time ago. I had the Curry \"Chicken\" with veggies and it was absolutely delicious. Simple set up, quaint and unassuming Green New American is a breath of fresh air to the idea of eating vegetarian or vegan. I hope to see more restaurants like this turn up in the Phoenix area, where the possibilities of eating vegetarian is not so inconvenient."}
{"text":"Really good food, super casual and really friendly. I have tasted most dishes on the menu and although I have a favorite I don't think I tried anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Embarking on my newest journey down the meatless diet road lands me here for dinner.  I was so very hopeful and completely open to my new experience.  Place is nice and clean so I ordered: * spicy buffalo \"wings \"   * egglessrolls * drunken mushroom chicken The wings made me think of boneless wings at first but I found them oily and slightly mushy.  I could only think of a frozen package of fake chicken that was heated and cut up.  Similar or the same maybe for the fake chicken in the drunken mushroom chicken bowl.  A breaded piece of processed, packaged and frozen fake chicken is all I could think about when eating, so I stopped. The egglessrolls appeared to have also been processed, packaged and frozen then,  deep fried in oil.  I was thinking that they would have been fresh rice paper wrapped.  They were mushy and oily on the inside.  Crispy and oily on the outside. The noodle dish deserved a bigger taste and perhaps a bolder sauce.  The vegetables were cut without care or respect to culinary skills whatsoever, often leaving parts that would have been better off in a stock or trash. I so wish that I would have stayed home and cooked my own meal on this day. I feel like I was at the TGIFridays of vegetarian foods. Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place, amazing food and customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm a recently turned vegan who gets to restaurants and either splurge on something heavy or get a salad.  So when I found Green, I was so excited to drag my meat-eating hubby to the other side of the vally.  We've had the mock buffalo chicken wings, the eggless rolls, crab puffs, jerk tofu salad, balsamic picnic salad, mexicali burger, secret bbq chicken sandwich, thyme fries, and sweet potato puffs.  Everything has been wonderful, but our faves are the chicken wings, eggless rolls, balsamic picnic salad, thyme fries, sweet potato puffs, and crab puffs.  Haven't tried the bowls yet but I'm assuming that they're just as good.   I crave this place all the time.  My husband thinks everything has been awesome, much to his surprise... mock chicken sounded a bit mysterious to him. So try it out both meat-eaters and non meat-eaters!  It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Please read my review of the tempe location. All my convictions are the same. Full vegan menu and right next door are the most amazing sweet treats!"}
{"text":"Longest wait ever for amazing ice cream. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a blizzard."}
{"text":"Really delicious vegetarian fare. Tofu is fantastic, and I'm not a health foodie. Dining room is pleasant. It's also fun to get dessert next door at Nami. Close to Phoenix Art Museum too."}
{"text":"First time here... Food was really good.. Daughter had a noodle bowl. I had a wrap , we split the wings. We will be coming back.. The only bad thing,no salt in the place.. It could use a little"}
{"text":"Amazingly fast service, friendly staff, INCREDIBLE food, decent prices, awesome laid-back atmosphere. I am so very glad we came here on our trip. I had the BBQ bacon burger with slaw and I also got chili cheese fries. No regrets."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week and had no idea what to get because everything sounded so good. Luckily, the lady at the front was more than willing to talk about her favorites and their most popular items out of the different categories (bowl, sandwich, etc)  I decided on the bff which is a faux fried chicken sandwich with jalapenos, guacamole, tomatoes and cheddar on a toasted bun. I also got a side of the tahini coleslaw because I was intrigued on what their spin would be.  The sandwich was sizeable and delicious! I'm not vegetarian but the mock chicken tasted great and the outer layer was lightly crispy/fried to add some nice texture to the sandwich.  The tahini cole slaw wasn't like your average cole slaw. It had shredded green and purple cabbage, but also green onions and peanuts. I'm not sure what else it was tossed in besides tahini, but I loved it. It wasn't heavy or drenched in a creamy sauce like some cole slaws are but it was light, crunchy, and fresh.  The restaurant itself is located in a building strip that has a few empty businesses making it slightly hard to see from the main road but the inside was very nice and there's a patio with chairs and umbrellas you can sit out on.  After seeing some more yelp pictures/reviews of the place I wish I had tried a tsoynami but I guess I'll just have to come back again."}
{"text":"50 minute wait for food, no apology or acknowledgement. Served 6 people before me who came in after me. Food wasn't very warm. Heard complaints from other customers waiting over 40 mins for one burger. This is very good vegan food, but nothing is worth the wait and treatment. Please Green, GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Even though I rated it 3 stars, it's one of my favorite junk food vegan joints out there. The food isn't anything necessarily unique or homemade but it's good ol' comfort, vegan junk food.  I LOVE the chili cheese fries (add sour cream)...Ok, that's not on the menu but they can make it for you, I promise ;)  The \"chicken\" wings are great. I like to mix the BBQ sauce and the hot sauce together.  Don't forget to stop at Nami and get dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  My (almost 18 year old) daughter and I are vegan, my husband and (also teenage) son are not.  ALL of us were happy with our food here.  We ordered the Big Wac (amazing) and the unegg rolls (also amazing).  My husband and I also enjoyed the Valentine's special (\"beef\" with fettuccine noodles).  We will be regulars here for sure.  :) I must try it all."}
{"text":"In a few words, I am in love with Green. My mom is vegan, and I am recently vegetarian, and it has been pretty easy for us to transition. However, it's been super difficult to find great vegan-friendly restaurants. Lo and behold, we found the most amazing place ever...45 minutes away from us :( Anyway, Green is incredible. I've had almost everything on the menu at least once, and I'm just such a fan. I prefer the mock-meats to the tofu, but the tofu is really great as well. I haven't disliked anything I've had yet. Of course, don't go in there expecting it to taste like typical food. Green serves the absolute best vegan/vegetarian fare I've ever had. And by now, I've had a lot. Were it closer to my mom and I, I think we would go there every single day."}
{"text":"This place is totally awesome.  For those of you, like me, who aren't vegan I'll just say \"Get Over It\".  The food here is DELICIOUS.  The Boneless Buffalo Wings are off the hook, Awesome.  The burgers are superb too.  I'm not a mushroom fan but my gal says the Mushroom burger is crazy tasty.  Then if you manage to save room for desert or you just want to stop in for it, you Gotta try the Tsoynami's... Spectacular! They feature various local art on the walls too so It's like a mini art gallery.  Green has another spot in Phoenix called Nami that is just as Awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegetarian food. I had the Wendy pickle and it was awesome. Great flavor and the bread was soft and delicious. My friend had the bagodah and she enjoyed it, but wished it had more jerk seasoning. We also split the wings and they were also tasty.  Even though I live in Tucson, I will definitely make sure to stop here every time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is fresh and unique. The food is healthy and they have so many options. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I ate at Green for the first time today. I loved the Thai Peanut Salad with mock chicken. My friend had the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was really good too. We plan on going back weekly. I love the community table, we met some nice people today also enjoying their food. Someone at the table recommended the pasta with \"meatballs\". I will be trying that next time."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and about 45 minutes after I left started daydreaming about coming back for dinner! Unfortunately, I was too full from lunch to need to eat again tonight but I will definitely be back on my next trip to Phoenix. We had the wings, the big wac and the Argentinian Po'boy. I don't usually order veggie burgers at vegetarian restaurants because they are standard fare at most places now but I made an exception because it came highly recommended and I am so glad I did; it was spectacular! The wings were also fantastic. The Po'boy was really good but didn't wow me as much as the others. We also went over to their sister bakery (nami) next door for soft serve and I would suggest you do the same- So. Good. Can't wait to come back to both places!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem! I so wish we had one in Portland! The vegan wings are so so so so so so so good! You have to try them.. wing lovers will unite on this sensational menu item. We also tried two of the bowls...both of which are outstanding. If you're looking for a great vegan, gluten free joint... that's casual and tasty.. this is so your place."}
{"text":"Meh. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes pretty good. It's just over priced and way too greasy.  So this place is definitely not a good choice for a light healthy meal. All the mock-meat and tofu dishes are overly heavy on oil, even the rice/noodle bowls feel super greasy. Maybe their salads are on the lighter side, but I've never tried any because I opt for junky delicious options, like their mock wings.    Their drinks selection is noteworthy, as it is vast and great (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  Oh, and I hate how they nickel and dime you for everything--like if you ask for extra sauce on something, they'll charge you for that."}
{"text":"Being a huge supporter of Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants I have experienced many good and many bad places to eat. This is an okay spot. 3.5 stars. Not too many fresh, flavorful options. Lots of unhealthy ones that at least don't have meat in them. I hope they start using Organic, non gmo versions soon in addition to creating a menu that has FLAVOR. Simple fresh herbs would go a long way.  Positive is the take out is on time and the vegan \"blizzards\" are yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan nor a vegetarian but I love this place. Their mock meats defiantly taste better than the real thing. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am a carnivore and I loved this place!!  I got the Spicy Peanut Salad.  It had a nice miso vinaigrette  dressing that wasn't too tangy but had a nice zip.  The salad was very fresh.  I wasn't wild about the texture of the mock chicken and the pieces were too large but, the flavor was good and definitely added to the salad.  We also split green hummus appetizer - OMG!!!  Definitely order that.  The pita chips are fried and nice and crispy....the hummus is a wonderful texture and the flavor tasted like more!  We also split the samosas which I wasn't as wild about.  I was expecting spicy Indian chutney type of samosas but instead, these were more sweet (picture apple turnovers) Middle Eastern type of somosas.  Not bad but not what I was hoping for.  The portions are large for the price and I left feeling very full.  I would definitely go back again and get the hummus and maybe try one of their curry bowls which looked really good.  Great value for the money and nice to know I was actually eating healthy for a change."}
{"text":"I was invited to eat at my first vegetarian restaurant by my sister & wow I was surprised! I thought I was going need tons of salt etc to make the food edible lol but it didn't need a thing. I had wings and the Po boy sandwich with coleslaw. I never knew vegetarian food was so good. All I can say is wow and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The vegan Gods have spoken and have decreed: \"Let there be Green\". Far and away the best Vegan place between Los Angeles and East St. Louis, Green is beyond awesome. The Buffalo chicken wing & samosa appetizers rule.The original po' boy sandwich? Unbeatable. And just when it can't get any better, you head next door to Nami for the best freakin' desert treat you'll ever have.  Green is keen."}
{"text":"I am not vegan, nor do I imagine I would ever do that to myself.  I have witnessed enough of my friends pretending they enjoy dehydrated kale \"chips\" or pretending to salivate over squished cashews with agave nectar (ok ok... so the cashew stuff is awesome... but whatever...)  BUT. This place has food that tastes good.  And for me, that's why I eat out. I want stuff that tastes good, and I am particularly thrilled, when said food is stuff I cannot make.   As I would never have the patience nor diligence to come up with trying to make food without meat taste GOOD this place wins... and I mean WINS.  Delicious.  And then you can leave the restaurant pretending like you did something good for the environment... like you didn't kill a cow today. Even though you probably will, at In-n-out... for dinner. :-P"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is amazing and the tSoynamis are even better. I would go every day if I could :)"}
{"text":"The food is good.  They put a little thought into their offerings.  If you like meat, I recommend you avoid the 'mock\"; no matter the form, mock does not taste like chicken.  If you're a mock eater, you already know Green.  Mike"}
{"text":"I like Green. Good food, relatively cheap, and a cozy atmosphere. I wish that it could be guilt free, but I'm willing to eat here again and again anyway. The mock-chicken is delicious. Who knew? And although I have not yet tried a Tsoynomi, I've been told by EVERYONE that they are marvelous. My friend had the Loco Coco (or was it Coco loco? I can't remember) and was moaning over its delicious factor the entire time she ate it. So yeah, I'm guessing it was more than good.   Green is worth a try, even if you're not vegetarian/vegan. I'm pretty sure the mock-beef or mock-chicken could fool my \"meat-a-tarian\" dad...well, maybe not, but he'd probably still be pleased."}
{"text":"Vegan = Tasty.  No macro platters here, though if they did have one, i bet it'd be covered in some mouth-watering sauce.  This vegan restaurant is for people who like animal products as much it is for people who don't.  Almost everything on the menu comes with at least an option of mock meat of one kind or another.  And mock meat is tasty, though probably not necessarily healthy.  The original \"g\" spicy po-boy reminded me almost exactly of Switch's Buffalo Bleu Chicken sandwich (my favorite).  It was hardly noticeable that Green's version had no bleu cheese, mock chicken patties and veganaise.  The texas \"moo-shroom\" po-boy was excellent as well with a sweet BBQ sauce and heaps of mushrooms, red peppers and onions.  I do not like the tahini coleslaw - too much peanut sauce.  We were so impressed with our lunch that we ordered a couple of cookies for dessert and that was when we remembered the reason we could never be entirely vegan....no butter in the cookies!  At least they use real chocolate instead of carob.  I also enjoy all of the green building products on the walls, but not the styrofoam cups, so much."}
{"text":"I love Green! When I moved out to AZ Land from Cali... I was soo sad that i couldnt find any vegetarian places then I discovered green! I am a patron! There all the time! The food is soooo delish! I am constantly craving a tasty asian bowl or their delish buffalo wings with their crisp green salad!!! bliss.... love love love love love love love :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister in law and was tired of eating crap food. So, when we stumbled into this all vegan restaurant I jump at the chance to sample the cuisine. My sister in law was complaining the whole time we were looking over the menu. \"If it is healthy then its not for me. \" or \"If its not full of meat it will taste like crap. \" These were the complaints she said as she finally decided to try the Singapore orange. From the first bite to the very end she was taste shocked into silence.  The only sound was her fork scrapping the bowl and chewing.  When she finished the very last bite she replied: that was fantastic and very unexpected.    This restaurant is highly recommended from a very non vegan person."}
{"text":"I got the Singapore orange bowl with rice and the house tofu, then went back only a couple days after to get it again. It's a lot of food and great quality, so it's worth the price. The vegetables in it are nice and big and the house tofu is delicious! I plan on coming back many more times!"}
{"text":"Some familial vegetarians introduced me to this gem (I've no dietary preferences).  Short and sweet...it's extraordinary!  Vegan buffalo wings?!? My military man/carnivorous husband says (guardedly) that these are the best wings he's ever had! And I agree...  Not to mention the \"Big WAC\", Diablo Red Bowl, or Original \"G \" Spicy Po-Boy (Buffalo mock chicken).   My soul mourns the fact that Green is far from my house and not open on Sundays.  Those buffalo wings...seriously...they will blow your mind. I want them now!"}
{"text":"I came in skeptical and left a believer!  This place is great! I am not a vegan nor a vegitarian, so when my friend Dave suggested this for lunch I was concerned.   After a bite of my mock chicken rice bowl with peanut sauce, I was all in. The lime aid is awesome too!  Don't confuse vegan for low calorie though!"}
{"text":"Decorators seemed to have a fun time putting the place together & walls are adorned with interesting pieces of artwork. Cashier/order receiver: pleasant and helpful. Server: lackadaisical, no eye contact. Food selection: vegetables, soy processed, sugar  Started w/ sweet & chocolaty almond milk shake. Not special but at least not dairy. Enjoyed thai peanut w/ carrots, brocolli, onions, soft tofu, served on bed of brown rice. The sauce coated everything besides the rice, and had a subtle taste of continental asia, but nothing in particular. Finished with plastic-wrapped super-sweet peanut butter bar.  Noticed lots of processed soy choices and that my two snacks were very sweet. These two characteristics keep my visits down to 2x's per year."}
{"text":"So so great! For appetizers, we tried the chili cheese fries (they were alright, used Daiya for the cheese, and I was hoping it would've been a homemade cheese sauce), and the crab puffs. Wow, those crab puffs were amazing! Since being vegan, I have missed having crab rangoons/crab cheese wontons at restaurants, and these tasted just like the real thing!! I had the thai peanut rice bowl, which was great (huge serving too, especially after all the appetizers, so I had leftovers!) and hubby loved the bbq sammie. Just when you think it can't get any more awesome, theres the Tsoynamis! Holy moly!!!!! These are like mcflurries/blizzards but with vegan soft-serve and all of your favorite goodies incorporated in. Some of the best dessert I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. Everything was awesome and totally vegan. I even got my meat loving boyfriend to admit it was great and that is really saying something. Does anyone know what they use for the beef substitute? Its some kind of mushroom based thing, but if anyone knows how to make something similar I will love you forever!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this wonderful vegan restaurant!!! I have taken several initially wary non-veg folks to Green and they loved everything they ordered. I have tried most items on the menu and especially recommend the Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\", Spicy Peanut Chicken Salad, Crab Puffs (I don't think they taste like crab puffs but they're so delish), Thee Argentine Po-Boy, Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy, Texas Moo-shroom Po-Boy, and the soft serve ice cream in a waffle cone, in a tsoynami or naked. The staff is wonderful, the place is nice and tidy and the recent expansion makes it feel much more open and airy.  Now all they need to do is stay open later and offer breakfast! Wonderful for everyone - vegan, veg, and non-veg alike!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give ZERO stars. The Argentine I got had next to nothing on it. Instead of veganaise the bread was covered in some green grease. Looked awful. Couldn't eat it. My side of thyme fries consisted of 12 soggy fries. I paid $10 for this? I'll never get food to go from Green, ever again.   Hope you take this into consideration before eating or paying for the slop they're serving."}
{"text":"Was here on business March 4, 2014. It took me forever to find this place because, being an out of towner, I did not realize there is a N. 7th Street and a N. 7th Avenue both of which intersect McDowell Road. Anyway, I got to the restaurant and ordered the spicy buffalo \"wings\" to go and had a glass of the local wine while I waited at the table and waited and waited...  I love the clever and artistic design of the place, especially the detailed little touches. I had visited the website before coming and loved the chef's story. I really wanted to love this place. Alas, the wine was meh though I loved that it came in a little mason jelly jar. Also, it took forever to get the one thing that I had ordered. It's not like the place was packed; orders were coming out of the kitchen. When other people who ordered just before and after I did got their food, I went up to check. The cashier checked on it and said it would be right out. Finally, 10 minutes later I got my bag and bounced.  The spicy buffalo \"wings\" just weren't that good. The breaded \"mock\" meat was overcooked and too chewy. The glaze on it was just ok. I eat (and cook) vegetarian all the time and have had some fantastic eats; this was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm a vegan and find it hard to eat out, but after discovering Green, I finally have a choice I can always rely on. The food is great and the service is very friendly. I recommend it to anyone--vegan or not!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hard to find tucked away in a strip mall, but it was well worth looking for. I had a \"burger\" and it was awesome!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, but baby brother lives in the Temps so whever I'm in town we go here! I am IN LOVE! Let's start with the thing I dream about while I'm awake and asleep... the soy soft serve! It is AMAZING. Imagine a blizzard with any toppings you want EXCEPT the toppings are one million times better and the soft serve is house made and SOY. Yes please. The best: Espresso grounds, coconut, raisins, and walnuts. Also amazing: the PB&J. Just get. it. now.  Everything I've tried has been fabulous. The prices are reasonable for the value, love and thought that goes into the food. The Mock Chicken wings are delicious and they even come with a delicious vegan cucumber \"mock ranch\" dipping sauce. All their Bowls look perfect but I need to try more of them and some pizza! Green come to San Diego. I'll run it! Everyone will love you don't be shy!"}
{"text":"Good overall just don't order the mac and cheese! Really, no, don't."}
{"text":"Just so delicious. Better than equivalent restaurants that uses animal products. I loved it and I'm hardly a vegan!"}
{"text":"One of the best vegitarian restaurants I have been to in the city. I love their spicy thai bowls with fried tofu with their brown rice and veggies.  I come here at least 2 times a month. I am slowly working my way up the menu. I have loved everything so far."}
{"text":"Very delicious! You won't miss the meat.  The Singapore tofu rocked. Everything smelled great and the service was wonderful. I will be back with the vegetarian children!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food is great and the desserts are even better. I loved the banana wafer ice cream I got with vanilla. I didn't care to much for the chocolate. I'm definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  The menu had a nice variety of choices and even had a sizeable \"gluten-free\" one too!  We had the samosa's, pad thai with mock chicken, edamame, jerk chicken pita (also made with mock chicken), fruit cup , fries and 3 drinks for $40.  Everything was very fresh and had nice layers of flavor!  I will definitely be coming back to this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"We love this place. 100% all vegan (and delicious!), so navigating the menu is easy.  There's usually a short ,one so like others mentioned grab a paper menu and make your decisions before you get to the register.    We always get the delicious herbed fries and usually one of the great sandwiches. The no-harm chicken parm and the original spicy po-boy are two of our favorites, but all of them are great.  Even non-vegan friends will love the food. Desserts are awesome as well. Love this place! I just wish they were open on Sundays! Love it and go there several times a month despite the long drive for us."}
{"text":"I've been vegan for over a year now and still cannot get on the mock meat train. I thought I would try the Big Wac first because in my former life I had a weakness for Big Macs but it just didn't hut the mark. I've really tried to like this, getting the mock chicken and steak sandwiches too but I guess I would just rather eat my veggies instead of eating veggies trying to be meat. If you are a person who has trouble giving up those food though, definitely try this out! It just didn't work for me. The baked goods from Numi are delicious though."}
{"text":"So in love with this little gem!  My husband and I come from California where you can find a vegan restaurant on every corner. After moving to Arizona I am happy that we have found GREEN! We ate at the Scottsdale location last night, and today during my lunch break I ate at the 7th St location! Both had the same great taste and quality! For any vegan skeptic out there...try GREEN before you try anything else...it will set a great standard of how awesome Vegan food can be!"}
{"text":"Really good place for vegans/vegetarians. Have been here twice. The food is delicious and freshly made. Do not expect a sophisticated eating experience. However, one of the best places for a casual meal. The people are friendly and the food is amazing! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick bite with our daughter before our tour at ASU.  She loves vegetarian and vegan food and this place did not disappoint! She had the Thai peanut bowl with noodles and tofu, I had the same but with mock chicken and my husband had the curry bowl with rice and mock chicken. They were all large portions and the flavors were great.  My husband's was a little dry so he asked for more sauce which they brought right out.  We all agreed we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Yay Green! This is my favorite place to take people when they first come to the Valley because they are so surprised that there would be a place like this here. Green has such a wide variety of dishes and flavors that people are sure to find something they like. Their gluten-free menu is pretty good, but I wish it were more extensive (that's where the 5th star went). I definitely recommend the almond milk milkshakes - they are amazing and sometimes I drive all the way across town just for that. The pad thai and chili are also favorites."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience at green today.   After purchasing $40 of baked goodies at nami we headed to green for some food.  I waited in line for 5 minutes, which was fine but when I got to the register to order the woman was very short with me.   I asked for a side of potatoes and in a condescending manner, she said, \"its lunch.  we have french fries\"   I ended up ordering a side of tempeh bacon and a wings appetizer.  My two children and I then waited for 24 minutes and nothing came.  When I saw a couple, that came in 10 minutes after us, receive their food, I went back to the register.   Same woman, dark hair, very rude.   I waited until she finished her personal conversation then asked about my order.  She replied, \"there are a lot of orders\"  When i explained my situation she was very dismissive and rolled her eyes at me.   I asked for a refund and she said sure, just gave me the cash and didnt even look at me.  I asked for a manager, she came out and just said \"'im sorry\"  I am so disappointed in the complete lack of customer service at a restaurant that I really love.   In the end we left with no food after a total of 35 minutes."}
{"text":"Some of the best , if not the best, vegan sandwiches I've ever eaten. It was a major personal disappointment when I switched to a mostly vegan diet that most vegan restaurants have limited, and frequently bland, sandwich options. This is not the case at Green. Sandwiches are flavorful, filling, diverse, and just plain ole' tasty.    The sides are ok, not bad but not spectacular like the sandwiches either. Service is solid, time from placing the order to digging in is good to great, decor is pleasant, and the prices are fair (~10 bucks for lunch if you get water to drink). All in all a sweet vegan option near down town Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm a confirmed carnivore. I admire my sharp, pointy canine teeth designed for ripping flesh off of a bone. I have an deep, abiding love for pastrami, ham and steak. Heck, I even like bologna and hot dogs-- the worst of the worst.  But if there ever was a reason to \"go vegetarian,\" it's in Central Phoenix at Green, who tout their cuisine as \"New American Vegetarian.\" This means it isn't all ooky cubes of bland tofu thrown into some stir fry or thin Mung Bean Soup. It is, however, 100% vegan with gluten free options.  Although Chef Damon Brasch, the mastermind behind Green, promotes his menu as \"comfort\" food, that may be a bit of a stretch. There's absolutely no substitute for, say, Shepherd's Pie, bacon or a roast beef dinner. Sorry. However, Green does have an attractive array of dining options that are very, very tasty, flavorful and filling.  The Spicy Peanut Chicken Salad presents spicy peanut mock chickenover fresh greens, carrots tossed in miso vinaigrette and tortilla strips. ($6 sm/$9 lg). Very appealing.  The Kung Pao Mock Chicken Bowl offers spicy ginger and garlic tamari sauce with crushed peanuts. Eight different bowls are on the menu with lots of veggies (of course) plus your choice of chicken, beef (mock), house or fresh tofu. Choose from either pan fried noodles or organic brown rice.  Take your pick from nine different po- boys, sandwiches and burgers. The \"No Harm Parm\" po-boy features a breaded mock-chicken cutlet with tasty Mum's tomato sauce and a dazzling mozzarella cheese. But the bread ... you have to try their bread. Phenomenal. All these are between $8.50-$9 and come with your choice of thyme fries, fresh fruit, or an incredible dolphin-safe Tahini Coleslaw which will knock your free-range socks off.  Green's cooler has a vast and delightful range of ice teas, sodas, mineral waters and flavored Kombucha that's a pleasure for any diner's palate.   You'll never see Colonel Sanders, Ronald McDonald or Long John Silver in here--but during our visit we saw Hollywood's handsome Kal Penn of stoner flick Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. (He must've had the munchies, dude.) He didn't find the legendary 100% beef hamburgers there, but he was in the right place for one fine veggie burger."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite veg restaurants in the Valley. The food is consistently delicious and the service is great. I just wish it was closer to my neighborhood in the west Valley."}
{"text":"basically this review could be two words BIG WAC. treat yo self  p.s. the wings were not good at all, like really not good. but the BIG WAC"}
{"text":"I love the Original G Spicy Po-Boy with thyme fries! Hot wings are my weakness and this meat-free twist on them satisfies my hunger when I'm in a healthy, yet indulgent mood."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and found Green by searching for vegetarian places on Yelp.  The reviews were excellent, and for good reason.  The food was fantastic, the art & decor was very cool, and the prices were great.  I highly recommend this place to anyone (vegetarian or carnivore).  As stated in other reviews, the staff is friendly.  When we arrived for dinner, they already closed the kitchen (since it was after 9 PM).  Not only did they let us stay, but they made us a large amount of food.  We started with the spicy peanut tofu and the samosas, both had excellent flavor.  For dinner we had the drunken mushroom chicken and the singapore tofu.  The food was delicious.  However, if I had to suggest one change for the entrees, I would have liked it if they used less salt.  Another thing that impressed me was their organic green tea was brewed perfectly (some restaurants mess up their green tea by steeping too long or too hot ... but not them, it was just right).  The decor was very cool and I like the amount of art they had around the place.  One of my favorite features were the tabletops and the design that they had inked on the tops of most of the wooden tables.  Very cool!  If they ever decide to sell tables like that, I would certainly get in line :-)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Green for a long time now and I have to say it is my favorite restaurant! All the meat eating friends I have ever brought there always ask when I am going back because they really enjoy the food as well. I just found out that they have been going without me and taking other friends, which I guess is okay since more business for this local restaurant is always great! I've never had a bad experience there and the staff is always amazing! I will be stopping by before I move down to Tucson."}
{"text":"I was vegan, and now a am vegetarian. I loveeeee this place. So nice to go somewhere where I can eat ANYTHING I want on the menu. Everything I have tired is amazing. For a year I did not try the icecream desserts only because I was afraid I would like them too much. Well I gave in and had one.... AMAZING. So yummy. Their bowls are all really good, and huge enough to share."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  I would recommend the Edamame, Wendy's Pickle, and Thai Peanut Bowl with House Tofu and Noodles.  The people here are always helpful and friendly.  Such a pleasure to have a date night here.  Also, good priced Kombucha and Nami (vegan desert shop by the same owners) next door!  Thank you :o)"}
{"text":"Have tried twice to visit this restaurant.  Never able to find parking.  Hopefully will be successful one day!"}
{"text":"Came to Green on a friend's recommendation and am glad I did!  I was a little skeptical of the vegan aspect of the restaurant and the \"mock\" meats, but all that went out the door when I tasted the buffalo wings.  Full of flavor with great texture... if you just handed the platter to someone, it would pass off as chicken.  I had the jerk tofu salad and like the apps, the salad was bursting with flavor and had a touch of heat.  I highly recommend it!  I ended the meal with the pumpkin tsoynami and it was a pumpkin pie in a milkshake... great spices and half the sugar.  A perfect way to end a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go there as often as possible, i always enjoy it. I always get good service and the food is always delicious, I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I enjoy this place as much as any other. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant by far! Being a vegan it is hard to find a place that will have options for me that isn't just a salad and that will actually fill me up. Green is always delicious and I feel like I ate a great meal after leaving!  Not only is the food great but the customer service is as well. I have only once had a cashier that was not 100% pleasant and helpful, and I have been here many times! I have taken meat eaters here and there are no complaints. The first time eating at Green was weird because the mock chicken was almost too realistic, the texture is phenomenal!   One warning I will give is that if you are allergic to soy, this is not your place. Every meal has a soy element (tofu, soy milk, etc.), so if you can not consume soy you have to ask for the meal without some of the key ingredients.   I have a sister who is vegetarian and although we are both about a half hour drive from Green we try to eat there as often as we can. Its that good! To add her two cents, she is very picky about mock meats. Every other vegan/vegetarian place we have tried has her saying \"I don't like this as much as Green.\"  My favorites are the Original \"G\" Spicy Po Boy, the Big Wac, and the Crab Puffs. My mom is a big fan of the Black Jack Pita as well! And although their coleslaw is great, I think the thyme fries are some of the best fries I have ever had!  Gluten free? No problem! There is a whole menu of items that are already or can be made gluten free. Counting calories? There are lots of delicious salads! Want to stuff your face full of delicious fried awesomeness? You have come to the right place!  I HIGHLY recommend Green to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike!"}
{"text":"DUH. THIS PLACE IS THE BEST. It is so nice not to have to drive to Tempe for my favorite menu.  The decor is simple and clean, the staff is adorable and sweet. My favorite items from the menu? 1. No Harm Chicken Parm 2. Tahini Coleslaw 3. Orecciette pasta  4. The secret bbq chicken sandwich 5. Homemade curry pasta salad 6. Balsamic picnic salad  Leave room for a Tsoynami. Just walk next door to NAMI and wait to be amazed. This place smells like sugar and coffee heaven."}
{"text":"This place is great for mock meat lovers! If you're a carnivore like me you'll still love this place. They serve burgers, noodle bowls, salads, etc. This place has it all."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a vegan restaurant, and it was a pretty good experience. I enjoyed my meal, and the service was quick and friendly. I had the special, something I don't think they serve everyday - Chicken Marsala. It was very tasty, and the pasta with marinara sauce was as well. The portion was a bit large for lunch, as was the price. Perfect for dinner, however. Other items more suitable for lunch were priced more appropriately. I will definitely go back to try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Admittedly we only tried 2 different rice bowls but they were exactly the same other than the different sauces. Vegetables were undercooked. Ratio of rice/veggies/sauce seemed off. Seems like maybe one of their sandwiches is a better way to go? Cool place but have had much better vegan food in the area."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING about green is perfectly marvelous. I'm especially a huge fan of the vegan soft-serve desserts &milkshakes. The french fries are delicious, as well. Definitely better than anything you could find... Well, anywhere. They have quite an assortment of sandwiches, noodle dishes, etc. My bestie's favorite is the 'no-harm chicken parm.' Also, they have a lemonade/tes bar &a rack of common vegan groceries for purchasing. The amosphere is toooo cool &the employees, SUPER nice."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday and ordered the  big wac and wendy's pickle, for my cheat meal. My bf loves the big wac and the wendy's pickle was good. The sandwiches are big portions, so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place.  So far, I ended up going to this place three times the first time I visited Phoenix, and try to stop in every time I come to town.  The fakey buffalo wings were AMAZING! and you must hit up the brunch on Sundays.  This place made my dreams of vegan biscuits and gravy come true. The first time I stopped in for Sunday brunch, they didn't have any biscuits left (le gasp!!!), but one of the employees managed to find me some texas toast, and it was so amazing.   The staff here is very friendly, the place is CLEAN, and the food is amazing.  Definitely worth five stars."}
{"text":"Best vegan junk food ever! My favorite items are the spicy wings and the big wac. I've brought my omnivore friends here and they couldn't tell they were eating a plant based meal. Consistent flavorful delicious vegan comfort food at it's best!"}
{"text":"Food was good the appetizer was small for the 7.00+ price it took 3 attempts to get my order right,the staff was friendly,will do them again I was gonna go more stars but getting my order right the first time is kinda important to me"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Had the blackened \"chicken\" salad with lemon tahini dressing. Can't wait to go back. Really, really good!"}
{"text":"the green salad was great wish you guys would have salt or black pepper shakers that would seal the deal for me"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Green and would probably eat there every day if given the opportunity. The staff consists of a crew of heavily pierced and tattooed alt-hipsters, who are typically very helpful and pleasant. They are always willing to explain a menu item. I've taken lots of non-vegetarians there and most have wanted to return.   Their buffalo wings are the best to be had in Phoenix, hands down. I love the \"Original G Po Boy,\" which features the buffalo wings front and center. And the thyme fries, oh jeezus. I tend to stick with the sandwiches, and I've never had anything I didn't like.  The ambiance is great, too. In cooler weather, they roll up the delivery door, which opens up a full wall of the restaurant to the outside world. It's nice sitting in the clean, modern setting while overlooking the 7th street traffic. Very urban and cool. The artwork, which is in constant rotation, is also something to be seen. I loved the NWA-themed stuff they had when they opened.   Excellent food, excellent experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am not vegan but I must say the food here is great!! I have been back several times and each time the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"OK first off, I am a meat eater.  I am happily engaged to a vegan, so I eat quite a bit of vegan food.  Green is by far the best vegan food I have ever had.  Let's face it, it was some of the best food I have had including non-vegan food.  Their sandwiches are phenomenal, I recommend \"the original \"g\" spicy po-boy\".  If I would have gotten this sandwich anywhere else, I wouldn't be able to tell if it was vegan. It's that good.  Oh, and get the fries.  The Fries are amazing.  Always perfectly cooked and crispy!  If you are thinking about getting Soy-nami, do it.  You won't regret it.  I got the Snuckers, and It tasted just like a snickers blizzard, probably better.   The cookies are also really really good.  I think we always end up getting at least one oatmeal cookie every time we go.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Even if you eat meat.    All vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters should eat here."}
{"text":"How to write a review for a restaurant that I patronize several times a week?  Green is amazing, so much variety, and innovative specials all the time.  Even my carnivore friends like the food here.  Green offers a good mix of healthy (salads and veggie bowls) and vegan fun food (burgers, wings, tacos, mac & cheese).  Not the typical tofu stir-fry vegetarian- Green offers pretty much everything you could want, but in a tasty vegan version.  Also, the staff is always cool and friendly.  A really great experience every time!!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan,  but our daughter took us to Green for lunch on a Friday!   Amazing food!   I had a spicy po boy and my wife had a rice bowl with mock chicken!   Food was great  A little spicy but very tasty.   Our daughter had the rancheiro salad...   Very tasty.   Loved it!   We'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I hate this place.  There are two Green's in Phoenix: this one in Tempe, and one in midtown Phoenix. And the difference between the two is night and day.  Part of what makes or breaks an eating \"experience\" to me are the surroundings I find myself in. When I am surrounded by Scottsdale Reich Mommies serving their kids \"healthy\" deep fried tofu and praising its healthful benefits, my stomach begins to turn. When I am out numbered 3 to 1 by hipsters sporting the standard hipster uniform, and stench, in 110* heat, my fists begin to clench. When I wander about to the bathroom and every square inch of the open space is some sort of high minded yet unfounded preaching about the evils of meat, my blood begins to boil. When the parking lot is filled with grubby little rich skater punk kids from Scottsdale trying to be scenesters, I just see red and either have to leave or face assault charges. Fat little wannabe future rabble rousers sitting in the corner yelling so loudly at each other that you can tell that mom and dad never put their hand up side little baby precious's head is where my cool came undone. I had to leave.  And best of all, the true cherry on the shit sundae, was the \"vegan ouija board.\" That's just insulting to the point where I wanted to take it down, and then just wait for the first person to come up to give me shit so I could wrap the frame around their head.  I'm not about to catch a charge to eat at this bullshit festival.  But onto the food.  - Greasy - Unhealthy - cold - For some reason they removed the soda fountain, and yet they have all the bottled drinks there with just as much sugar as, if not more than, a coke. Sounds like this was done for profits, not health.  So why would I bother going here? I do this to indulge my girlfriend and her vegetarian family. But I don't think I can do it again after tonight.  I understand the benefits of the lifestyle, but when your \"lifestyle\" makes you look like nothing more than a bunch of over indulged white kids suffering from \"the white man's burden\" you need to reevaluate your whole thing.  The New Green over in Phoenix, on the other hand, does not cause the ire that this place does. From now on I will do all I can to deprive the Tempe Green of my money, and the money of anyone I associate with. Gotta vote with your dollar dollar bill y'all."}
{"text":"If I were to quote my friend Saul \"Its vegetarian junk food, what's not to like...\"  I like the 7th Street location better than the one in Tempe with one notable exception, there are no soft drinks. I get it, Coke isn't vegetarian in nature, but I am not a vegetarian, so let's work something out here.  The art is way lower key at this location, which is nice. The Tempe location's art is almost distracting from the food.   The chicken wings are great. The meatball sandwich leaves something to be desired.   I dig it. Glad its close to down town now."}
{"text":"Green is a vegan oasis in this cruel desert.    It's not easy finding tasty, satisfying vegan food....until you've discovered Green!  The menu is varied and the specials always offer an exciting vegan twist on dishes typically available solely to meat-eaters.   Although basic, I'd have to recommend the Big WAC (vegan burger) with the thyme fries (thin and crispy) - it's totally addicting!    They also cater to the vegan sweet tooth with baked goods and tons of different Blizzard-style Tsoynamis.    They post their menu online (of course) and it's definitely worth checking out before heading there because there are so many delicious options to consider!  Sidenote: both locations have great atmosphere, fun interior design, and are CLEAN!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.... the fact that they had an Ice Cube ice machine was amazing. If you don't know what I mean then you will have to go to check it out! I had a Big Wac here and honestly no vegan burger has ever been able to stand up to it! It was literally perfect. I have tried several versions of vegan big macs and none compare to it! The fries were also amazing. I seriously consider going back to Phoenix just to go here to eat!!"}
{"text":"The big wac was way awesome my wife ordered it and i got the coconut curry bowl it was very filling being that we are in diets. Nice to know you can eat out and still be health conscious."}
{"text":"OMG. Go, just drop everything you're doing and GO! This place is amazing! It's so refreshing to have these fun vegan options available that taste SO good! We had the Big Wac (ridiculously good) and the Wendy's Spicy (awesome as well). YUMM-O!"}
{"text":"Glad we found this place! It's a vegetarian joint and I didn't even care because the food was delicious. I got Henry's special (goat cheese, onions, butternut squash) on flatbread pizza...holy crap that was yummy! The husband  got a beet and ginger soup topped with goat cheese. I have no idea what they are putting in that goat cheese but that is what we were raving about 90% of the time we were there. He also got a Caesar salad - it was a nice surprise that they added some raw broccoli in there as well (that way you feel like you are getting -some- nutrition out of it)."}
{"text":"MY TAKEAWAY: Great food. Will hit the spot. Cheaper than most vegan establishments in NY and namely Brooklyn that I've frequented. The service leaves a lot to be desired. I would gladly be willing to pay more for a better customer service and overall end-user experience. Going out to eat or grabbing a bite outside of your home is more than just about getting good food, it's the totality of the experience. From how you order, the staff, speed, food quality and consistency, atmosphere, etc. This place is great already, as-is; however, if they want to take things to even bigger heights, they may want to revisit the way you order and/or the staff's ability to offer better customer service. Everything else is perfect. Maybe it's just the New Yorker in me, that has come to expect more. Food-wise this place even beats some of the best places to eat at in Brooklyn, NY. Yes, even those classified as some of the best Vegan establishments. I will be coming back. How often? Well, that is yet to be determined. If my customer service experience changes in future visits, which would make this place an easy 5 stars, I will be sure to update my review. This place is nearly perfect!   Green, the first vegan restaurant I've visited since moving to Phoenix, AZ. There is a decent selection of vegan establishments to choose from, yet I choose this place to try first. Mainly because before moving to Phoenix I was doing some research and came across this YouTube video featuring this establishment and it's next door bakery Nami. (link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5CwdOGYb88) After seeing the passion behind the brand and mouth-watering food, I had to try it for myself, once I completed my move to Phoenix.    I've frequented this location on two occasions, once on a weekday and once on a weekend to get a better feel of the place.  First visit, a weekday: The service leaves a lot to be desired. You go up to the counter and order then have a sit and they bring you your food. The customer service and/or the end-user experience isn't the best, however, you don't go to a place like this for its service. I'm well aware of that; however, it would have made my experience that much better and truth be told the amount of times that I would frequent this place would have been a multiple of what it is or would be now. The food matched my expectations and slightly surpassed them. The BIG WAC, boy, oh, boy! Excellent. Filling, tasty and utterly satisfying. My burger fix, as a vegan, has been fulfilled in the most pleasant of ways. Their wings are also amazing. I tried them on this visit.   Second visit, a weekend day: Service slightly worse than my weekday experience. There was a line to order unlike my first visit, but no worries because the line moved fast. The staff was very efficient in managing the high traffic. I'll give them that. Overall, customer service was a little worse than my earlier visit. Food was great again. I'm liking the overall consistency from my only two visits thus far, food wise. I ordered the BIG WAC again, fantastic.   That has been my experience. You should try it for yourself. It's more than worth it. I hope this added value to someone out there.  Happy Yelping :)"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and decided to try their Chicago Cheese Steak. The food was amazing and the staff was extremely friendly. I just found my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"A Vegans Oasis- living in Portland I'm pretty spoiled and was so excited to try this place out while in AZ, after having it recommended by a vegan friend. I had the artichoke chicken salad with ranch dressing and it was a good size, tasty and filling. I got one of their soynami shakes for dessert which one should not pass up, kind of like a blizzard and they have a lot of combination options. Overall this place was clean and the good was reasonably priced. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Hokay, so Green. I've tried vegan food in the past and although some of it is okay I have never found a love for it... That is until I found Green.  This place has amazing food! I had the Medical Burger with the Thyme Fries and oh em gee!!! Super delicious!!! I can't wait until my next visit to try something else.   Then there is the beverages, I had their natural teas and yummy. Their Sweet Limeade was super good.  Also atmosphere and customer service are also important to me and they did very well with the feel of the place and the staff is very fast and friendly with lots of energy."}
{"text":"I love green. I've been eating there for a few years now, and while it may not be the healthiest veg good, it is delicious. I was very disappointed today when one of the girls (a blonde haired girl) at the front desk was incredibly rude  after I inquired about the kind of \"meat\" being used. She refused to talk to me about it, saying it was secret. Shocked, I stated that businesses really should disclose that type of info without hesitation, and she said \"no, they don't and aren't going to.\" I thought she was very hostile even though I was just curious. It's not like I was going to try and steal their recipes!  Staff should be friendly and understanding about questions, its what makes customers trust and support their efforts."}
{"text":"Green was an amazing meal that I crave and I am not a vegetarian. You can not tell that it is not real meat. The employees were really nice and the ambiance was great. The vegetables were cooked perfectly to where a vegetable-hater loved them and now I order vegetables whenever I go out to eat and can not find another restaurant that replicates the taste at all. Amazing place that I look forward to eating at again. Easily one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Love those garage doors that open up when the weather is nice. I'm not crazy  aboutabout the mock chicken but they have a good tofu and veggies. Still need to try others menu items, I'm sure that I'll upgrade the stars after liking more dishes."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian cuisine in Phoenix, easily. It has a cool, artsy environment with a nice vibe. The service is pretty fast and it's not too expensive, considering the amazing delicious quality of the food. I'd say the average meal costs 12 to 15, including drinks and the almost mandatory order of crab puffs (they're that good). om nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Today I took a vegan client to this restaurant because I heard that the big wac tasted as good as a traditional meat burger.   Highly skeptical I ordered myself a big wac and was pleasantly surprised as it was just as tasty as any meat burger.  This restaurant has restored my faith in vegan cuisine.   Next time I have a vegan client I know my go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are in a hurry or expect extraordinary service.  Been here quite a few times. Food is pretty tasty but service sucks!!!!!! If there was a contender for this cuisine I would not come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were at an environmental conference in phoenix last week. Would you believe an environmental conference didn't have vegetarian food options? So, we had to look elsewhere for dinner. We were glad we found Greens and likely will be back on our next trip to the desert. The place must be close to ASU after seeing a plethora of customers that certainly looked the college part.  After reading all of these reviews on the crabcakes, we had to try them and I'm not sure what the big whoop was all about. Ours appeared to be kind of burnt and maybe that was the problem but I didn't actually care for the filling either.  Being out of towners, we weren't quite sure how the place works. So, we were actually sitting at a table for several minutes before we realized we had to order at the register.   For the entrees, we had trouble deciding and had to ask some helpful patrons while standing in line for some advice. We got the Drunken chicken and Thai Peanut. The Drunken Chicken was the better of the two dishes."}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian or vegan and I looovveeee this place. Their \"mock\" meat is on point and the freshness of their ingredients is obvious. Would recommend to everyone, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love this place. We go here all the time to meet with friends and it is an awesome place to hang out.   I always get their Ranchero Salad and a burger or sandwich. My top favorites that I recommend is the Big Wac and Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich. Their Thyme Fries are the BEST!  I am Asian that grew up on home-made Asian Foods, so I don't think their Asian bowls are that good. I use to get them and I would ask for less sauce or sodium because I thought it was a bit salty. Besides that, I love their food.   I love the thought and design. I always think of inviting friends because it is so cool inside. I love how the artwork changes all the time. This place really makes vegan food appealing to those that are spectacle to the idea of vegan food.   I am thankful that they are closer to me now since I live in North Phoenix! I go as often as I can!"}
{"text":"I had the blackjack pita sandwich and needless to say it was pretty awesome! The employees were very nice and courteous and I got my food real fast after ordering it. Really look forward to coming back there!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant.  We were in town visiting people in Phoenix for 3 days, and we went here 3 times.  Incredible.  Insane pizza (they use Tease, which is magnificent), delicious \"chicken ranchero\" salad, which happens to be gluten-free (incredible) and an amazing bbq chicken sandwich.  One caveat:  it's possible to have mock meat overload here, so follow the lead of the venue's name and order something green, too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We go here any chance we get. The wing ding dinger is the way to go. The staff is always friendly aswell."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Customer service was TERRIBLE!!  No one person even said HELLO, or made us feel welcomed with ever a smile."}
{"text":"First a disclosure from me. My favorite food is anything with Pork Belly and I am addicted to mostly pork. That being said, Green is one of the place that I go to whenever I can't think of anything that I want to eat in particular. Green should be synonymous with Tasty since all their foods are very good.  I don't care if they are Vegetarian or Vegan, tasty is still tasty, meat or no meat.  Good quality vegetarian foods are not cheap and Green is pretty reasonable with their offering.  They have one of the best mock-meats that I've ever eaten and fresh veggies abound.  I can eat their Vegan Chili Fries by the bucket and still feel good after (tips : add some Sriracha to the ketchup to add more punch to the fries).     So put off your doubts and reservation and give Green a try. Maybe you will find out like me that sometimes eating Green is a good alternatives to Pork Bellies (note to self : need to roast some pork bellies !)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh IN LOVE. Friendly staff, great food, healthy and unhealthy options available. I want to try their breakfast next! I have never had a bad meal here. Anything is good!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is fantastic. This is the best vegan junk food place I've been to. My only complaint is that the parking is a little tight."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan or vegetarian but do enjoy the selection on the menu. My friend wanted to come here for her birthday lunch. I looked at the menu online and found enough that I agreed to Green for lunch. She ended up cancelling, but the menu had me interested, so I went alone.  I have been 5 times in the last 6 weeks and have tried a different item each time.  The bowls are my favorites, with the Diablo bowl so far the best. I stay away from the mock anything because I know I will be disappointed. Friendly staff, and very quick for lunch. The chips for the hummus are great, some might consider them salty."}
{"text":"Why offer online ordering but make customers wait in the same line to pick it up? Food is decent but pricey."}
{"text":"My wife and I share the crab puffs and two of the sandwiches. All were great and we hand an outstanding dining experience. I'm just sorry I didn't try the wings - next time."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty disappointed in Green. This was my first experience at Green and as a vegan, I don't think I'd bring a non-vegan here hoping that they'd think vegan food was super tasty.    My (non-vegan) friend and I both thought our sandwiches were over-sauced and he actually couldn't even finish his. I will say the texture of the mock chicken was good...but, again, the sauce (mine was BBQ) was way to overpowering.   I guess if you're vegan and are craving something meat-like, this would be the place to go.    I might go back to try a non-sandwich menu item...  Also, it would have been nice had the waitress not taken my half-eaten meal off our table when I got up to refresh my drink.  While it wasn't the best lunch ever, it was still my lunch and I would have liked to have finished it."}
{"text":"Stopped in, while passing through on I-10, based on the Yelp reviews. It was a hit!  We had burgers, fries, the egg rolls and strawberry lemonades...zero complaints. Would go in all the time, if we lived here."}
{"text":"The house special tofu is amazing! The kung pao noodles is good, get it with the house special tofu! You won't be disappointed! I've also had the po'boy sandwich which was pretty good too. The fries are amazing here. I would recommend this place to vegetarians and anyone who wants to dine healthier :)"}
{"text":"A non-veggie like me would reconsider if every meal could be like this. The food is excellent! We highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Green has fantastic options to suit all tastes and appetites. It attracts vegans and nonvegans alike and I love how it helps people to explore plant based options. For those interested in a beer or wine with their meal, they have a fantastic selection. They offer teas and bottled drinks as well. I have never been disappointed by any meal I have had there, and I have visited dozens of times. I recommend it to everyone. It gets quite a lunch crowd but I always manage to find a place to park and to sit. The food is reasonable priced, delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"About once a week I find myself saying, \"wanna go to Green?!?!\"   I can't get over the no-frills, cafe-esque atmosphere with purely good veg head food. Mind you, I am not a vegetarian anymore, but I do prefer to eat foods of that nature. My boyfriend is a meat-and-potatoe type but still can find his fill here.   Careful friends, it is easy to drive right by here. It is located in a dowdy looking gray strip mall... but oh-so-conviently next to a bike shop.   There are a few \"mock\" foods here, but gooooooooooood mock foods. The wings are really tasty. But, they were voted for the best mock chicken in the valley a couple years back.   Meat eaters, do not be afraid. This place is delicious. Whether you're feeling adventurous or just wanting something light... you cold definitely find something really great and satisfying here."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. We were 5 vegetarian people looking for good veg food and this place didn't disappoint. I had red diablo and was really good. Try their imitation meat, it's really good. Highly recommend for vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Finding healthier alternative solutions to my burger cravings is not always easy in the valley. I tried a lot of vegan burgers around, but this one takes the cake! Try the Big WAC! And there are plenty of other dishes to try here."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It has great food, the people are nice and it's just a great meeting place for my friends and I. I do suggest it."}
{"text":"This place is SOLID!  I love the barbecue sandwich...I brought my husband and he didn't even know it was mock chicken.  The french fries are perfectly seasoned and slightly crispy.  The tsoynami's are the real attraction for me.  Aside from the flavor combinations they suggest on the separate tsoynami menu, you can create your own concoction.  Good stuff!  Another one of my favorites in their cole slaw with tahini.  It has good flavor and a slightly crunchy texture.  It is very fresh.  Aside from the good food, the service staff is wonderful.  They are welcoming and helpful.  Most refreshingly, they are totally unpretentious.    For awhile I was eating at Green 2 times a week because it is so good.  But then the budget fairy intervened and reminded me I can't afford to do that ad infinitum, so I treat myself as often as I can to this hip, delicious culinary experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best vegan food in the valley.  I have never had something here I did not love.  I take my carnivorous friends here and they love it too."}
{"text":"Amazing assortment of dishes that are packed full of flavor. The use of spices to enhance and pair flavors demonstrates top notch creativity. If you are a fan of brussels sprouts then the \"dagobah jungle\" is for you. Dig the Jedi tribute in the clever name. The art on the walls is also unique. The whole experience is just the right vibe. Weather permitting, dine on the patio!"}
{"text":"Not even vegetarian and the Argentine mock-beek samndwich is amazing. Also the sweet potato puffs are like candy."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're slightly hungry, share some samosas and crab puffs. The chili fries r great too - my daughter is vegan and I'm veg and we both loved the food and funky ambiance. Worth driving a distance for!"}
{"text":"I saw that the menu has alot of basic,  easily approachable vegan food. It has simple,  straightforward vegan options for food you'd usually get from the drive thru or Chinese take-out,  kinda. I thought the food was good especially for people looking for vegan alternatives. It was not great only because it tasted like regular fast food. I was just surprised the flavors weren't more developed and taken a step further.  I wasn't expecting that. I got take out (spicy po' bo and classic burger) & my car smelled like a burger king and it tasted like a whopper lol..  Not saying it's a bad thing, but since being vegan I haven't really looking for things to put me in mood of eating McDonald's or burger king. I think if I order something different my opinion will change.  We'll see!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give a good review but I really can't .  I went into this place and the food was ok but not very consistent.  Sometimes they saute veggies and sometimes they don't.  The staff all have pretty bad attitudes and especially some of the girls who take your order.  I think they should get more friendly people and work on their consistency.  I mean if you are taking peoples orders at least say hello and thank you!"}
{"text":"OMG...from the moment i discovered this place (and met the owner who took the time to chat) on my first visit, I have to try very hard to not just go there all the time!!  As a Vegan, it's a nirvana of choices and flavors...but it's not diet friendly because, on our first visit we sampled almost every item on the menu!  Definitely try the Big Wac...even my meat loving husband liked it and he is one tough customer. So, it's a treat but a yummy one and well worth having.  Don't forget to go to Nami next door to cap off with a dessert, or do Nami brunch on the weekend...with seating at Green."}
{"text":"YOU MUST EAT HERE!  Love THE Salad and my S'more Tsunami.  Well, it was my daughters, but still it was delicious.  Service was great.  I was totally impressed."}
{"text":"As a frequent vegan restaurant goer that hates most faux meat/cheeses, I was AMAZED that Phoenix had this great of a vegan restaurant.  I ate there every day for the week or so while I was in Phoenix.  They have plenty of gluten free options, including alcohols, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality, taste, and service.  I can't recommend any particular dish because everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Couldn't be better. Perfect vegan comfort food. Try the cruelty-free Big Wac and say goodbye to macdonalds forever !"}
{"text":"Well I eat here pretty much every day. So yah I'd say it's pretty damn good. The Big Wac burger will have you hooked for life."}
{"text":"First of all, we knew it was going to be good when we drove up and noticed the great smells from the parking lot! Let's start with the building and decor. Urban hip all the way, clean with a great vibe. I noticed and loved all of the recycled materials used so creatively in the decor. You can tell there are smart and creative people behind this business and it shows.  My girlfriend has been a vegetarian for 30+ years and while I am not, I do all of the cooking in our house and have developed an appreciation for this type of cuisine and am always looking for creative ways to spice up our meals. Most of the meat substitutes found in stores do not measure up to whatever they used as chicken-less chicken in their spicy buffalo wings. They were so flavorful, had a great meat texture, and the ranch dressing to cool it all off was delish. I can't wait to have them again! We then tried the Green Hummus. Again, very flavorful, the green part coming from a creative use of Poblano Peppers and drizzled with a little sesame oil. I thought the pita chips were a little greasy and since I try not to eat fried foods very much, I thought it would be cool if they offered and un-fried option but they don't. Then again, I didn't ask. Whatever they used to season the chips with was also very good and very flavorful. We then embarked upon the crabless-puffs. Nothing remarkable but for a creamy fried (Ughh) little puff, it was great. The \"Green\" salad was kind of blah compared to everything else we had, but it was fresh and organic and made me feel better about myself after munching down all the fried stuff. The service was super fast and friendly. I thought the pricing was dead-nuts. Even the bathrooms were cool! We can't wait to go back and try more things! We have a great appreciation for restaurateurs who actually pay attention to detail and take the time to develop a creative and super flavorful menu like this. Worth the drive, worth the money, worth our time = Five star review."}
{"text":"Secret bbq chicken = badical turbo radness. The fries are also excellent; thin with the perfect crunch and not greasy.   the no harm parm comes in a delicious red sauce on a nice sized roll.   when finished, go next door to Nami for delicious (but kind of pricey) vegan dessert!"}
{"text":"Great local vegan place. Try the chicken parm with curry pasta salad."}
{"text":"great salads and fries. Cool hipster environment with a really yummy ice cream spot right next door!"}
{"text":"So to compensate for my not-so-positive review I just wrote, I am writing accolades for one of my favorite places.    As far as vegan fare, this is the best as it gets.  And I'm not even vegan or vegetarian...and that's saying quite a lot.  Their food is yummy and affordable (and makes me feel better that I'm eating at least one meatless dish for the day).  The ambiance is just such a cool, beatnik, hippie vibe, that I'm surprised they don't have live local music on occasion.    I pretty much like everything on the menu, but my absolute favs:  1) any of the tsoynamis 2) drunken mushroom with mock chicken 3) BBQ chicken sandwich 4) mongolian bowl w/mock beef  Who knew mock meat could be so tasty?!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Green location in Tempe many times (which is always great) - and I tried this one for the first time yesterday. Seems like it's in a great location and it definitely stands out. The service was friendly and quick and the food was fresh, hot, and delicious. I would recommend their veggie burgers to anyone - they are made there and are unlike any I have had. Love this place!"}
{"text":"For what it is I love this place. There aren't many all vegan places in the Phoenix/Tempe area and this place has so many options. Being vegan and trying to have as little soy as possible is my only issue but this place has many fast options if you're craving vegan comfort foods. Everything is deliicious and I leave feeling full and happy! Sometimes too full but that's my own fault."}
{"text":"Had the chicken artichoke salad and it was delicious, even though I kept wondering to myself...what the \"chicken\" concoction really was.  I did wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food...the cashier said to just go ahead, find a seat anywhere and they will find me.  They apparently looked everywhere except that little patio a few steps from the cashier.  :-(    Since it was a salad and not a hot entree...no harm done!  I will be going back.  Since my first visit I have been back several times...service has been perfect and I really like this place ALOT."}
{"text":"I ordered Animal Fries, which is a simple order, to go. I waited 20 minutes to get my food and other customers who ordered after me received their food before I did. The waitresses were extremely passive aggressive and did not provide the respectful atmosphere an established restaurant should have. I have been to Green multiple times but never to this extent of customer neglect."}
{"text":"IN LOVE WITH THE BIG WAC. yes! i have been a vegetarian for 10 years now and going on 4 years as a vegan. I have got to say that i have tried MANY vegan places but nothin beats Green. I Love this place, great food, nice staff, fast waiting times and just overall a wonderfull enviroment."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now, and I have three words to throw out about this place: Burgers, Tsoynamis, and Ambiance.  1. Burgers- Best large menu item they have. Their imitation meat tastes delicious and has just the right amount of texture and flavor. I have also tried their wings, bowls, curries, and fries, and none of these have lived up to the standards that the burgers have set.  2. Tsoynamis- A must-have item! These soy-based ice creams are light, so Green serves you a very large amount with each order. They have a lot of different every-day flavors, as well as some seasonal ones on a board that they have. I highly recommend the \"Kissed by a rose\" flavor (rose, chocolate, strawberries) if that is up on the seasonal board.  3. Ambiance- Green is such a cute place to come grab lunch or a light snack. They are big supporters of local art, and have interchangeable art pieces on their walls that customers can buy. Everything has a sort of hipster-vibe to it, and with the natural light streaming in through their large windows, you will always leave the place feeling calmer and happier than when you came in.   Definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this based on my experience with the orecciette pasta.   But first I would like to say that just because it's vegan does not mean it's healthy or organic. Green uses organic ingredients \"whenever possible\" as stated on their menu. This place is pretty much a vegan's guilty pleasure.   Orecciette Pasta The chips looking things they gave me with my pasta was pretty good. The tomato sauce ...I didn't like it. The vegetables were chunky and weren't cut good ..but that probably doesn't matter to a lot of people, I just like my veggies cut nicely.  The little earlobe pastas were good. The mock breaded chicken ...normal.   Atmosphere This place has a casual artistic atmosphere. They have flyers supporting locals around and they also have Java magazine for anyone to look at and take.   Employees Nice, happy employees. I just found it a bit weird that she got a bit tense and hesitant when I asked her about the food like she was afraid I was going to ask about the healthy stuff of the ingredients or something.   It was worth a first time visit just to satisfy my curiosity but I won't be coming here to eat healthy. Seems like the place for vegans to go if they have occasional unhealthy cravings."}
{"text":"While the staff does a good job imitating meat dishes with plant-based ingredients, the primary ingredient is (sad to say) soy, which is TOXIC to the endocrine system--especially in men, because soy is a phyto-estrogen. Don't they know this? As bad as meat is for one's health, one would be better off eating meat than the toxic crap known as soy. Some of their dishes are made from nutritional yeast, but the majority are made from the infamous soy, which makes this place basically off limits to a health-conscious man."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the crab puffs and big wac here. The staff is great and the food is always on point. The food comes out pretty quickly as well which is another plus. I still to have yet tried a lot of things but everything that I've tried has been awesome. The artichoke chicken salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I'm no vegan but I stumbled upon this restaurant during my lunch break and thought \"THIS IS (EXPLICIT WORD) AMAZING!\" I've had their kung pao mock chicken bowl with noodles and it is to die for! My favorite thing on their menu is the spicy po-boy sandwich. I definitely recommend this place to carnivores/vegetarians/vegans!"}
{"text":"Mention any sort of Kung Pao, and this vegetarian begins to shake and quiver. I tried the Green version with the crispy tofu, and found it delectable. Spicy yet not overpowering and the tofu lived up to its description.   The wife got a jerk salad that was also very tasty. The servings are quite good for the price and the atmosphere is excellent. Good for people watching. Green reminds me more of a restaurant from Seattle or Portland, which is a nice touch in this never-ending drive of TGI McFunsters."}
{"text":"Green is my absolute favorite place to eat on this earth! You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu. It's all delicious, from the wonderful appetizers, to the amazing salads, to the entrees with mock meat. And don't leave without trying one of the scrumptious desserts. Everything is priced very reasonably and that staff is always smiling and helpful. I wish I could eat here every day! Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or meat-lover, try this place out. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love their bowls and veggie burger.  My partner loves the big wac.  The \"chicken\" patty isn't my favorite, as it often seems too thick and fried, but the concepts are awesome.  Plus always a great selection of beverages!"}
{"text":"I happened to drive by while looking for a place to eat. Got the Philly Cheese Steak and Tahini Cole Slaw. Both were especially flavorful and deliscious. The service was quick and friendly! Decor clean and neat! I a vegetarian for over 40 yeaes, I loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is decorated very playful and fun.  Great vegetarian junk food.  Very unique and yummy"}
{"text":"I was recently visiting Phoenix from Portland and we decided to try Green for lunch. I had heard good things about it from Arizona friends. It was hard to pick what to order on the menu because I wanted like 5 things. I ended up deciding on the Thai Peanut Bowl with soy chicken. It was absolutely amazing. The vegetables were very fresh and a bit al dente. I loved the soy chicken. And the peanut sauce was the perfect medium level of spiciness. My companion had the Coconut Curry Bowl with soy chicken and also loved hers. She asked me after we left if I would come back to Phoenix just to eat there. I said I wasn't sure but you wouldn't have to pressure  me too hard to take another trip to Phoenix. She (a non-vegan) also said she wished we had Green in Portland and said it was the best vegan restaurant she'd been to. Anyway, I need to get busy planning my next vacation to Phoenix for about 7 days so I can try everything I want! Or Green could always open a location in Portland. You'd be much loved here."}
{"text":"Finally a taste of green! Samosas and sauce perfectly on point. Curry bowl with pan noodles and veggies was deeeelicous, but I will add mushrooms and maybe chicken next time :) ordered online, supa speedy quick nomnomnomies ^_^"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the food at this restaurant. The \"house\" tofu is simply amazing, the food is generally great and the service is friendly and all that I need in a restaurant. My loss of star comes in because of the menu.  There are some GREAT menu items, but unfortunately, the descriptions are seriously lacking. I ordered a \"creamy\" artichoke dip, which led me to think I was getting an Italian-inspired creamy artichoke dip. But what I got instead was an Asian-spiced watery artichoke dip that did not even try to be creamy. It was more like a spicy soup.   The spicy soup was good, but it wasn't what I expected, and certainly not what was described on the menu. It's all about consistency, and unfortunately, they didn't deliver in this area. But, nonetheless, I will come back because the food is great!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but my wife is and I love this place. For other meat eaters whos significant other is vegan or vegetarian this is the perfect place to go together.  She'll love you for taking her here and you can get the Big Wac burger which is basically a big mac but way better and more healthy.   The staff has always been super helping and nice. And unlike other places if you admit it's your first time here they don't look at you like your a street urchin, but are excited and help you with the menu. 6 stars!"}
{"text":"Vegan restaurant jackpot!  Wings and fried Brussel Sprouts are so delicious"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire valley. They have amazing vegan options from spinach dip to cheese fries to double cheeseburgers. All are extremely tasty. Everyone should try this place, not just vegans and vegetarians. The menu is so creative and shows people what vegan food is truly all about. 5 stars, they even have deserts!"}
{"text":"I love-love-love Green.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. I understand the restaurant was busy when I was in, but still... 30 minutes is way too long of a wait for JUST ONE WRAP to go. After waiting 30 minutes (plus 15-20 in line to place the order) I finally just asked for my money back.  I was never rude and I did not raise my voice or show any signs of agitation. But all I got after waiting nearly an hour was sarcasm and an attitude. They did not offer to comp the food, nor did they even bother to offer an apology. All they said was that they \"simply forgot\" and I would be refunded in \"about 3-4 business days.\" That's an hour of my life I will never get back.  It's the second time something like this has happened to me here, but I figured I'd give them another shot, and that was a mistake.  There are other vegetarian options in the Phoenix area, and I highly recommend taking your hard earned money elsewhere. It will be the best advice you will ever get on here."}
{"text":"We loveeeeeee this place! Best place to eat as a vegetarian. Best environment ever! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan option with creative menu items that NEVER fail to satisfy... LOVELOVELOVE!!!"}
{"text":"I love going here and get suckered into going to Nami next door every time lol can't resist. Friendly service and clean"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  I pretty much always get whatever the special is.  I think the sandwiches are honestly a little better than their stir-fry stuff but   this does not detract from how awesome the place is.  Go for the Spicy G if you want a spicy faux-chicken thing or the Argentine PoBoy for a delicious, sweet flanksteak-type meat sandwich.    It is a little pricey sometimes, but you are paying for specialty foods.  Their vegan/veggie market in the store is convenient if you want to try something out, but it's really marked up in comparison to buying almost any of these things from the internet (not even in bulk)."}
{"text":"Guys. This is great vegetarian food. I am not a vegetarian, and I loved every bite of my Asian noodle bowl with tofu. My husband got the big wac, I took a bite and it was delicious. Basically it's good vegetarian food and if you have friends that are on a pretty restricted diet (like mine are), this is a fun place to take them because they don't have to scour a menu for the only salad in town - they can eat it all. Plus the ice machine had iced T on it. What could be better?  Next time we plan on checking out Nami for their awesome soy dessert. Woo!"}
{"text":"We have come here twice and each time is was delicious!! We have only come during Sunday Brunch, but we look forward to coming during the week to checkout their other menu items."}
{"text":"I have been to Phoenix 3 times, and to Green 5 times - I make a point to eat here whenever I am remotely in the area. Every time it is amazing. I'm not a vegetarian but prefer veggie and healthy options most of the time, and this place just hits it out of the park. Definitely get a cup for their homemade beverages as well - my favorite is a mix of the green tea and sweet lime. Hard to go wrong with anything but my favorites have been the noodle bowls, the mock chicken wings, and the \"fish\" tacos."}
{"text":"I've been once, and the food was delicious, but later my tummy was a little upset from the imitation meat. I ate my leftovers the next day and felt fine, so I think it was just because I'm not used to eating fake meat. My boyfriend is a huge fan of this place, and I'm definitely down to go again."}
{"text":"Oh gosh.  SO GOOD.  I've never gotten something here that wasn't delicious.  If it were legal for me to marry the Original G buffalo wing po-boy, I probably would. Their Green Burger approximates the taste of a fast food burger, something I haven't had in probably 15 years, in a way I never thought possible.  The tsoynamis are the perfect treat for a hot day.  And EVERYTHING is vegan.  EVERYTHING.  It's so lovely to be able to walk into a restaurant and order anything on the menu instead of scanning it for the 2 or 3 things you can actually eat.  Come here, and bring your friends.  Tell everyone you know."}
{"text":"I have been to Green twice and both times I have received a heavy amount of rudeness from one of the employees. Which made my visit a bit overthrown but besides that fact the food was great. Although I wouldn't recommend the chili fries as a meal like I did, too salty to be eaten by itself so just leave it as a appetizer for the whole table. The wings are a must so be sure to get a serving of those!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with the ice cream here... I get the peach cobbler one and it is to die for. I also have gotten the chili fries which are great, and the chicken sandwich is totally a Chickfila copy cat....which is AWESOME! Only wish one was in the east valley. There are not many vegan options out here besides noodles. I am willing to drive 45 minutes to get here any day though!"}
{"text":"I eat meat but love this place.  I have had the faux chicken sandwich--- it is awesome. I also have had the Thai curry bowl--- very, very good. Another item you MUST try is their berry punch or lemonade. They are freakin' awesome.   Service is friendly and everyone is very cool and laid back. It must be that they do not eat meat which makes you somewhat irritable and violent?!?!  LOL.  Get a friend who thinks vegan food is dumb or nasty and take them with you. Chances are, you will open their eyes.  I recommend this place wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"2nd  time this month ordering something to go. 15-20min later  Expecting to just walk in and get out.......nope had to wait for everybody to order ahead of me watching my food sit behind the one cashier they have working getting cold! Not very efficient. Other than that wife and I love the big wacs! Ranch sauce use to have some thickness to it but now they make it  just water to water down for my liking!"}
{"text":"i'm not often overly impressed by vegan food - it's healthy so no need to be tasty - but this place is amazing.  almond milk shakes, homemade lemon and lime-aid.  spicy po boy sandwiches along with the spicy faux chicken wing sandwiches are huge stand outs but everything i've had seems to be incredibly good and , i assume, very healthy.  not sure how they pull it off but very impressed.  never had a bad dish and i make it a point to come here 2 or 3 times every time i'm in town on business. which is often.  the cutey college girls trying to look casual while wearing low cut t-shirts are kinda funny too.  \"like, yeah, i just threw this loose fitting , low cut tshirt on without thinking. i had no idea that it exposes me so much! oopsy.\" getting back to the subject though - the food is good."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, but this place has great stuff! I love their mock chicken with peanut sauce, as well as their chocloate chip cookies. Definetely check them out!"}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian or vegan this place is a must! My favorite thing on the menu is the Thai peanut bowl with the mock chicken for protein. The secret BBQ Sammy is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"The three stars is probably unfair because I'm not vegan. But I got a pad thai with tofu and I like tofu, lots of yummy veggies, noodles okay. My boys ordered pizza, some sort of cheese substitute I almost gaged when I tried it, the cheese was gross and the sauce sugary sweet. That was just inedible. My husband got a fake beef dish and that was actually the best out of them all. But if you are vegan why bother with fake beef? I don't get it.  I ordered an oatmeal cream pie it was like biting into a block of sugar. My kids loved it. Never again."}
{"text":"On a recent 5 day trip to AZ, I went to Green 3 times. My boyfriend is from Mesa, and he loves this place and wanted to eat there as much as possible while we were in town for the holidays. I loved it! I can understand why he wanted to go here so much!  The first time we went I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich and eggless rolls. Both were very good. The chicken on the sandwich was very good as well as the sauce and the bun. I ordered fries as the side and they were the best fries of my life. Skinny little crispy but not too crunchy delicious fries. I pretty much hate all other fries now because of Green. The eggless rolls were good too and I really liked the sweet sauce they came with. My boyfriend ordered the original g spicy po-boy. It was good, but I think the sandwich I ordered was better.  The second time we went we split the no harm chicken parm and eggless rolls. It was that good.  The third time (second time in 1 day) we went we split the meatball po-boy and fries. It was really good! We also ordered a tsoynami that had chico sticks and chocolate chips in it. It was seriously like eating a Blizzard it was amazing!  I plan on trying to recreate it at home, but it probably won't be as good as Green's.   Green is a great place to go for vegans and non vegans. The prices are fair and the service is quick even though it seems busy all the time. They have a million drink choices and a varied menu. I also liked how you ordered at the counter, and bussed your own tables which I don't mind doing at all especially when there is a line of people waiting for seating. I will definitely go back several times next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Green Vegetarian- I love this spot in Phoenix. I loved it the 1st time and then without even realizing it, I ended up here a second time! The combo of great food, casual atmosphere and affordable prices make this place a total winner. Both times I've been here I have opted for the 'Bowls' which offer different preparations/sauces of a sautéed vegetables with brown rice (or noodles) I have gotten the Kung Pao and the Diablo and both were awesome. Simply prepared fresh veggies with good amount of heat make this a great healthy option. They have a bunch of different Veggie burgers and salads as well, which got rave reviews. Not to be missed if looking for healthy lunch or dinner in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nice new look. Same good food. Tsoynami's take FOREVER but other than that it's a good spot."}
{"text":"The food is 5 star..... Big wac is an absolute favorite! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the parking is horrible. Try to come when it's not busy and it will be a great experience!! :-)"}
{"text":"We visit Fountain Hills once or twice a year, and we ALWAYS make sure to visit Green. Everyone in the family loves it. I think we've tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Amazing food, amazing drinks. My personal favorite is the Big Wac. I only wish it was a national chain.  Grand Rapids, MI would love a Green Restaurant!!!"}

{"text":"So yummy!  I ate here for the first time and ordered their Vegetarian Cheesesteak - DELICIOUS!  The ambiance is trendy; it was so busy and service was friendly and fast. The only odd thing is their location. They are tucked into the corner of a plaza, so you could easily miss it. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, interesting assortment, good booze, friendly staff, great atmosphere.  What I had was more comfort food than health food, though I'm sure it's easy to eat healthy here, too."}
{"text":"Delicious and great prices.  There are so few vegetarian restaurants in this part of the country but these guys do it right."}
{"text":"I can not wait to move back to the Arizona so that I can try everything on the menu! Flew in last night from Maine where there are very limited dining options, vegetarian or otherwise. I had the  Mandarin orange(I think this was the name) noodle bowl with house tofu and my meat eating boyfriend had the BBQ 'chicken' sandwich and fries. Both were amazing! Great portions of delicious food for a very reasonable price. I can not recommend this place enough. Only downside, hard to find parking!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, vegan or non-vegan, there is no place better. The atmosphere is chic but comfortable, the food is OUT of this world, and the staff is warm and always friendly. There is nothing on the menu that isn't fantastic, and their weekly specials are always a hit.  From noodle/rice bowels to Po' Boys (a type of sub sandwich) to vegan crab puffs and vegan buffalo wings, this place will leave you for hungry for more vegan food, as it knocks the socks off of anything that contains animal products!  Give it a try, you will be ADDICTED for life!"}
{"text":"Go there now---If you're not in Tempe go there anyway!  Visiting from Los Angeles--and was staying at a local upscale destination resort--No vegan friendly dishes except salads--hold the cheese.  I went to GNAV tonight--the place was amazing--great energy and friendly service.  I was wanting a burger since a friend had a meat burger at the aforementioned resort yesterday.  I was not disappointed--the Big WAC is delicious--I have only had 2 juicy vegan burgers and this was one of them--the other in LA.  Coupled with the delicious Thyme fries my \"meat\" fix was in.  So--I can't speak for other items--and unfortunately return to LA tomorrow--for those of you lucky enough to have this near you keep it in mind."}
{"text":"We used Green to cater our wedding food. I was a little nervous because we got married 2 hours away and they had to deliver so I didn't know what the quality of food would be after sitting that long. The food was AMAZING! The quality and freshness lasted the ride up and throughout the night. The whole process working with the owner Damon was a breeze and he made it super easy pick our menu. All our wedding guests complimented the food and a few meat eaters were very surprised it was vegan. Especially the wings! I would definitely recommend using them for catering. As well as dining in. Favorite vegan restaurant by far!!"}
{"text":"Phoenix needs more quality vegan places like this!! The ice cream is an amazing value $5!!"}
{"text":"Love green! Both locations are on the smaller side and have good outdoor seating. Green provides excellent and tasty vegan food, at a reasonable price. Depending on the time of day- the line can get really long, so make sure you have time, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and wanted a good vegan experience.  Being from CO, we have excellent vegetarian/vegan fare so my expectations were high.  We got the spicy edamame, Big WAC and Calexico burgers.  GREAT flavor, friendly service, quick with the food order and arrival!  Amazing experience! W"}
{"text":"This place is yumm-o!  Totally vegan with very tasty meat alternatives.  I see that a few people said that it's \"greasy\" and \"fattening.\"  Well, it depends on what you order, first of all.  Also, vegans never said that they don't have fattening foods sometimes.  This restaurant would be considered a TREAT (kinda like when non-vegans go to Red Robin or a steakhouse as a treat).  The food is priced right, tastes great, and it's a cool way to get your friends to try vegan stuff the non-scary way :).   Try the crab puffs, no harm chicken parm, mushroom with mock chx and veggie bowl, and the oatmeal cream pies...those are all my favs!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on but it seems like they are adding more salt to most of their stuff and I can barely stand it anymore.  I love this place but honestly they need to ease up on the salt or I won't be able to eat there anymore.  I really wish they would update their menu too."}
{"text":"i always chuckle when people say vegetarian food is boring. next time you hear that, send them here. then pat yourself on the back because this place is awesome."}
{"text":"First off I'm from Chicago.  I was raised on meat and potatoes.  The thought of going to a vegan restaurant has never sounded appetizing to me.   A few weeks ago my friend Mike a fellow Chicagoan took me there for lunch.  I'm hooked.  Been back two times in a week and a half.  Forget about it being vegan.  Green is just a good restaurant.  I have tried the Argentine sandwich, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Teriyaki chicken, chili cheese fries and more.  Everything tastes great!  The prices are reasonable and the service is fast and friendly!   I love the decor, it has an earthy hippie vibe.   My favorite thing at Green is the the Soynami,  it is their version of  a Dairy Queen Blizzard!"}
{"text":"They have been closed due to remodeling for some time now and as of this review, do not know whether they are open... But I can't wait!!!  I'm really hesitant to use the \"v\" word here as to scare any individuals away, because it shouldn't.  I've been going to this little eclectic eatery about once a month for the past few years.  It's a great to take your vegetarian friends and even more fun to take the meat eaters too.  I've probably had pretty much everything on their varied menu that consists of Asian to american and a few little twists in between.  Definitely get a appetizer and while I like their salads, save it for a return trip if it's your first time.  If you like whatever it is on the menu at your favorite restaurant, you'll like it here too!  I absolutely love garlic and its a staple in most of their bowls and other items.  It's not overwhelming, but still noticeable and this is a  warning.  As for the tofu items, I've only sampled a bit and it seems to be good, but with the mock meats offered and how amazing they are from taste to texture, I save the tofu when I'm forced to go to some other vegan place that doesn't offer it and not quite as awesome either.  I'm a meat eater and have zero plans of changing.  However, if I got locked inside green for a month, I'd be quite the happy camper!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant left a lot to be desired. The vegetables were tough, hard to chew and digest. That includes the so-called cooked vegetables. The mock chicken was also tough, hard to chew. We went as a group, and the acoustics were terrible. We couldn't hear ourselves think. The only thing I took away from this experience was gas."}
{"text":"mock - chicken wings that were...wait for it...gluten free! I almost fainted with relief when they tasted excellent, with no trace of suck whatsoever. In fact, they could end up being almost dangerous for me, thank the Gods I live in Phx and not around the corner.  as others said-super friendly helpful staff. I hate being the GF person, and to actually have choices, that someone else could explain and give suggestion to, was lovely.  The fried tofu in my bowl was delish, rather large chunks, but very flavorful.  wanted to try the tsoynami(sp?) but we got there early, no wait plenty of tables, but by the time I thought to order the line was a \"U\" round the restaurant...next time dessert, you and I shall palaver..."}
{"text":"Very yummy! I be been a vegetarian for 25 years and I can't remember the last time I ate a Big Mac. But Green's Big Wac tastes like I remember it. Two tasteless patties, slathered with thousand island dressing, lettuce and onion on a sesame seed bun. Wendy's pickle is a mock chicken sandwich. It had too much vegan mayo for my taste but the spicy sauce was good. The spinach fundido dip was excellent. As were the thyme fries. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious & the portion sizes are perfect, great location too...I'm giving the place 3 stars because I did not feel comfortable with the cashier...This has happened more than once too, she was not friendly whatsoever.  She didn't smile at all, nor did she seem welcoming/nice.  I believe her name was Taylor. . . Let's be happy  & give positive vibes to one another."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not vegan but I like trying new places and a friend suggested this place. I had the Drunken Mongolian with monk beef and it was full of flavor and the portion was perfect. Also had their strawberry shake which was delicious and a great way to end my meal. It doesn't hurt that the staff was very friendly and helpful in making suggestions. It's not very close to where I live but I'm sure I'll make it back there."}
{"text":"Fake chicken parm & burgers were ridonkulusly delish!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian isn't always the easiest lifestyle to live.  People tease you, and give you odd looks when its brought up in conversation.  And god forbid a meal at mom and dad's goes by without someone making mention of your weird eating habits.   Its a good thing that Green came along to help strengthen our resolve. and more importantly, to help convince non-vegetarians that vegans and vegetarians aren't a bunch of weirdos who eat soy-paste and lentils all day.   With a wide array of options on their menu, Green has enough variety to please pretty much everyone, vegan or not.  After eating here at least twice a week for the last few months I've come close to sampling the entire menu, and there really isn't a bad thing that I can say about it.  The mock chicken and the phoney beef  used in Green's sammy's are alarmingly accurate in both flavor and texture.  The curry bowls are some of the best I've had, and the orecciette pasta with chicken  parmesan is worth killing for - which is saying a lot in vegan circles. Bottom line:  if you're in the neighborhood, you'd be a fool not to stop in and sample some of the items on the menu.  If you don't find something at green that you absolutely love, you may want to see a doctor, because there is a good chance that you are dead and haven't realized it yet. Finally, if the slew of rave reviews here on yelp hasn't convinced you yet, you can check out Green's menu right here:  http://www.greenvegetarian.com/menu.jpg"}
{"text":"Yay Vegan!! Everything I have tried so far has been good. My only complaint on the food would be that the Bacon Burger could use some lettuce or something. It's just a bit plain and dense.. It needs a boost!  However, the Wac is awesome! and the fries are always good. They're thin, crispy, and best when hot!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried a number of different things and they were all yummy. The eggless rolls and Samosas were the best. Had a great selection of beer at reasonable prices and some delicious drinks for my kids. Will definitely go back when we are in the area"}
{"text":"It's a good option for vegetarian food but I'm not sure it would be my favorite.  They have a good selection of drinks and teas but the protein leaves a little bit to be desired"}
{"text":"Green is an awesome vegan restaurant. The food is delicious and the menu is creative. Try to catch some of their specials when they have them and then stop next door at Nami for a vegan ice cream or baked treat."}
{"text":"Sooooo amazing   Best burgers ever. I never thought eating vegitarian could be so great. I had their BFF burger and wow my mind was blown. It actually inspired me."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Heard about it from my daughter and it is now one of our top favorite restaurants.  I love the Big Wac.  I like veggie burgers already, but do indulge in a turkey burger once in a while.  The Big Wac is so good it can replace my turkey burgers :-).  You can have it with a side of fries, cole slaw or fruit.  I had the cole slaw with the tahini sauce...very good.  The portions are good but I didn't feel stuffed afterwards."}
{"text":"You know what. Im not even going to write a long detailed review.   If you are a vegetarian/vegan. Go here Simple as that. You will not be dissapointed. Beware you will probably come back a dozen more times."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic.  The service was quick, the restaurant was clean and there are lots of delicious options to satisfy everyone.  The atmosphere is urban and the menu options promote locally sourced, humanely harvested ingredients.  Green New American upholds a consistent vision from the soda machine that only serves water to the always sustainable dishes.  I was certainly impressed by the mission of Green New American.  As far as the quality of the taste, my mind was blown.  I am not vegan or vegetarian, in fact the majority of my current diet is meat based, so I was unsure what exactly to expect. I was highly impressed with the number of available options.  I ate the buffalo chicken po' boy.  The ciabatta was crisp, the lettuce was fresh, the soy based \"chicken\" was a perfect dupe, and the buffalo flavor was akin to the deliciousness of Franks and Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauces.  My only regret was that I did not try their coy ice cream.  I will certainly be dining here again just to try out some more of the delicious menu items."}
{"text":"Green changed their menu, and got rid of their 'green veggie burger' which was one of the only items on the menu that did not have processed soy. It was made with rice and veggies and beet juice and now it's been replaced with fake meat. I'm just bummed since it was my favorite and you could order it on ezekial bun for a healthier option. Okay, I get it, this isn't a 'health' restaurant -- it's a vegan alternative for fast food and whatnot, but a girl can dream.  I have to say their fries are still my favorite and their noodle/rice bowls are delish. Uhhh and their fresh green tea/limeade/lemonades are so good. Mix them all up for the perfect beverage. Don't forget to go next door to Nami and get their vegan 'tsoynami' ice cream blizzard-style concoction and a latte (with coconut, almond, rice or soy milk)."}
{"text":"I agree with Monica J's review. My wife and I sought out Green while vacationing in Phoenix. We seek out healthy and real food places to eat everywhere we go. While Green's offerings are substantially healthier, they use a lot of sugar/sweeteners in their menu. Some items are rather small for the price. I had their special of the day which was street tacos. 3 small tacos with not a lot of anything in them. If they had filled them with a bit more cabbage and thrown some fresh salsa on them, they would have appeared larger and less like airplane food. The tacos came with a side of fries. Interested in how they did their meatless chili, I ordered them with some of their chili on top. While the fries were cold and not very fresh, the chili was to die for! The rice bowls that other customers ordered looked very substantial and appealing, probably the better choice for next time. We tried a couple of the tofu soft serve for desert. Interesting and a great substitute for ice cream, but still loaded with sugar. I too would like to be able to see the actual ingredients and nutritional values for their menu items. But, I imagine that they wouldn't be much healthier than other fast foods.   So, for a vegetarian or vegan alternative, I'd give them 5 stars. For a \"real food\", low carb, or sugar free choice, 2 stars. For the amount you get vs. the price you pay on some of their menu items, 2 stars. The atmosphere and service levels were great. I'd score them 5 stars here, but the \"Homiez\" artwork was weird and didn't fit with the rest of the motif, so 4 stars."}
{"text":"We love green and we're not even vegetarian/vegan. The mock chicken is a delight and so is the service. Especially Simon, who told us she wanted her name to be Simon. So welcoming and relatable. I prefer this location to the Scottsdale Rd. one. Our vegan friend was in town from Portland and we ate here for 3 days straight. Food was quick and delicious--tried the Big Wac for the first time ever. Holy shit.   As in the words of Liz Lemon: \"i want to go to there.\""}
{"text":"First time I visited was so amazing, second time worst customer service ever!!!! cashier  ignored me and took another persons order I was standing in line behind the other two ordering then it was my turn I had thought but a group of three came in after the cashier looked at me and gave a smirk like she knew what she did.  Needless to say I thought sb 1066.5 was being used so I went across the street to Rice Paper and had the most delicious meal (firecracker shrimp one of the hits)   I have ran several restaurants, terrible experience today at Greens."}
{"text":"I will always recommend this place for vegans and non vegans in the area, however, I cannot rate 5 stars since they changed their menu last year. Prices went up, they took a lot of options off the menu, and sides no longer came with the meal which now they charge quite a bit for those sides. We attempted to return even after our disliking of the menu change and left disappointed. I'd still recommend trying the staples you hear most about and that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"I have recently become vegetarian after my last Green review. Today, I tried the Big Wac at Green. It was so good and tastes pretty much like a Big Mac! I saved my appetite all day for dinner, and let me tell you, I still was not able to finish my meal! They really give you plenty of food to fill you up! I used to eat meat with EVERYTHING, but let me tell you, I don't even miss meat with the mock-meat at Green. I pay a pretty penny for a meal at Green, but it is definitely worth every cent. If I ever get a craving for a filling yummy meal and I don't want to cook, Green is where I run to!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! If you're a meat lover, you may still really enjoy it! The ambiance is really hipster and the food is on point. The craft beers are solid! We are the Big Wac (a classic) and it tasted phenomenal. Everything has a different twist and the price point isn't bad. Definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I wanted a nice healthy dinner tonight and I got it with a phenomenal dessert.  Had the Thee Green Salad and Edamame. Staff is very good looking too :) I will come here every time I come to Arizona.  I can't wait to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"TSOYNAMIS RULE!  Awesome frozen soy / Blizzard type dessert!  (I have not been impressed with the few bowls I dropped, gloppy salty more gloop food.)  For MONTHS, we did not know there was a menu... just ordering off the 3-4 specials listed on the chalkboard.  OMG.. once we knew, we go every other week driving up from Chandler.  LOVE this place as a dairy intolerant person."}
{"text":"Parking has not enough space, but the food is fantastic. I had the Big Wac, it's a vegetarian Bic Mac. It was delicious, but next time I will order extra sauce. There were too many bites of dry tofu burger. A more experienced vegetarian I am sure would be more toleratant of that but I struggled with it."}
{"text":"Too many tables. People constantly having to scootch around you and squeeze between chairs. As for the food. I usually would get a \"po'boy\" with the kungpao sauce. (a special request) this time I was unpleasantly served the \"original g po' boy\" which is their mock chicken slathered with the saltiest tasting buffalo sauce. So unapealling I couldn't even power through the whole sandwich even though I was starving. Mind you I love hot wings and buffalo sauce in general but this was nearly inedible. I will give 3stars cuz the fries are epic and when they don't give me the wrong po'boy I'm satisfied. Just stay away from the original g unless you like eating salty spicy vomit on a bun:)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, especially good for vegan fare, they've got a decent gluten free menu set up too!  Problems are in the service, since the start of summer 2011 it has gone way downhill. Today I waited for 35 min for my food, had other people who ordered after me served, then when they finally noticed me, they came over and told me to come up and ask if my food is taking too long. Isn't that their job to serve in a timely manner? Since when do I pay $10 for $4 worth of food to not get served?  On top of it, they screwed up my order, I had to go back in and get it fixed (more waiting time). Being late, being stupid, and being wrong? Three strikes in one visit - this place is done.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best authentic vegan/American cuisine ever!!! I can't stop going for their Big Whack burger!!!! So bad, but SOOO GOOD!!! Thank you for existing Green!!! Super happy to have found ya! I have not tried the Asiany dishes yet cause I'm stuck on this sandwich. But having been to vegans places in LA, this one tops as one of the best!! Place could be a little cleaner as far as the tables being wiped, but other than that, no complaints! Staff is usually nice too. Open one in Fountain Hills!! Or some place close to that!! Haa haa..."}
{"text":"Came here twice. The first time was just to check out the menu so I only got a beer and their \"buffalo wings\" which I believe are made of cauliflower and are very good. I recommend them. Then today I went for their Sunday brunch and had their vegan biscuits and gravy and a chocolate peanut butter crunch donut. The biscuits and gravy had great flavor and I really liked the tofu scramble and potatoes that came with it. Their tofu scramble has a better texture and flavor than most that I've tried. The meal wasn't hot when I got it - in fact it was almost getting cold. The donut was gluten free (I don't require a gluten free diet; it just happened to be) and I got it because it was smaller than their \"main selection\" of donuts which are all very large. The donut was like a very moist chocolate cake donut- very little to no peanut butter flavor and no crunch- that did not bother me at all because it was still really good. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This places is just awesome.   Really good variety of food, a surprising beer selection as well as non alcoholic beverages.  The dining area is open with smooth music playing and full of colorful artwork adorning the walls.  When I return to AZ I will be back.  Don't shy away just because of the vegetarian title!  I had a bowl of Kong Pao with mock chicken that was exploding with flavor."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! Great vegan comfort food love the big wac better then a Big Mac. Everything I have tried is amazing. Big fan of the animal fries and the green lime tea. It's a great place.. their mock meats are really good. I have not had anything I don't like. I wish their were more places like this around the valley. I also love their sister Nami the dessert place next door. Really great place a little expensive but worth it especially if your eating a plant based diet but crave a Big Mac...."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party here with some people who had never eaten here before and they came a little skeptical about finding food they would like. They were so happy with their selections and very satisfied. Thanks to everyone for the great food and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"There aren't as many options as I hoped. Food is good, not the best vegan food I've had, but good!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that non vegans come and eat at this joint. It's that good! I love the variety the menu offers because if I'm feeling not so healthy I can get me a big wac....which insanely tastes like a better version of the Big Mac! But if I'm feeling healthy they have a good variety of veggie bowls too :) so gooooood."}
{"text":"Great change from the unhealthy lunches I was use to in the Pacific NW.  I tried the tofu Thai peanut rice bowl and the poblano humus.  Both were seasoned perfect with great flavor's.  Plenty of veggies and I didn't leave hungry!  I will be back more often than not!    Food Guy Out!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I are here once a week usually. Every item I have had on the menu is spectacular. People who complain about it being catered to vegan 'junk food' obviously didn't realize that they are known for COMFORT food that is also vegan. There are also good salads, wraps, and other items that don't have to pack on the calories if that's something you're concerned about. Do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"Have been a regular here off and on over the past several years as my schedule allows. Everything is great and the staff is welcoming. I love the original G sandwich with fruit as a side and a soynami as a treat while I wait for my food or catch up with a friend. It can be busy at lunch and dinner for those who are new. Don't let this discourage you. It's a great place."}
{"text":"So today I tried the downtown location. I'd only been to the Tempe/Scottsdale location before and had really liked it, even though I'm not vegan or vegetarian.   Well, I don't know if it was this location or if the restaurant has changed that much but it really wasn't good. Not at all.   The Green Burger that I'd eaten at the other location was phenomenal. I've lived with vegetarians for years and have tried a lot of vegan and vegetarian food and have never cared much for it (unless I was preparing it) but the Green Burger was amazing.  It was a house ground and packed oats & barley veggie burger with fresh lettuce and tomato, vegan mayo, ketchup and pickles (per the website).   When I tried to order it today, it was no longer on the menu. I was told the menu had recently changed and the patty is now different - even though the Green Burger is still listed as a menu item on the website. This new burger is just awful. It's much smaller and it's soy based and tastes worse than a Boca patty. If I wanted a crappy little frozen soy patty, I wouldn't pay nearly ten dollars for it...   The fries, which were also amazing at the other location were nothing special here either. They are supposed to be seasoned - they are called \"Thyme Fries\" so I expected some, I don't know, thyme?  Nada - no seasoning whatsoever. They were good but just plain old fries.   It wasn't just me. My husband who has 16 years of vegetarian/vegan experience and who really enjoyed the Argentine Po-Boy previously just looked at me and said \"no bueno\".  It was mostly bread with hardly any filling in it.  Much different than the other location.  Between apps, sandwiches and a couple of iced teas, it cost nearly $50 for lunch for my daughter, husband and me.  Totally not worth it.   I'd go to the Tempe/Scottsdale location again if I knew for sure the Green Burger was available, otherwise I can't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Casual but excellent vegan dinner after a visit at the nearby Heard Museum.  It really hit the spot."}
{"text":"On the night I flew into Phoenix to visit my friend, this was one of the places she suggested we go for dinner.  She and I decided to order food to go since I had just flown into town, she had just gotten off of work, and we were both a bit tired and wanted to get to her place, eat our dinner, then crash for the night.  Didn't take very long for us to receive our order (wasn't busy), which was good. Small inside, but nice atmosphere, and pleasant, helpful servers.  I ordered the artichoke chicken salad and paid $2 to have avocado added to my salad, and it was AMAZING! Very filling.  If I had not known any better, I would have thought that the \"un-chicken\" was real chicken.  Only downside is parking, which is why I gave the place four stars.  My friend had to park in an adjacent lot, which was dark, and at night, regardless of the neighborhood, it's always best to park in a well-lit area. Need to improve on that if possible.  Otherwise, I will definitely go here again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried here so far has been delicious!!! Always friendly service and the food is affordable. The BFF sandwich is my favorite so far! The tsoynamis are soooo good!!!! The cookie dough one is awesome!!! The spinach dip is also really good!!! The place was packed all the way up until closing time on a Saturday night so the wait time to order was kind of long, but they get your food orders out pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"Dough Boy, Oh Boy!  It's my favorite.  Thank you for providing a cookie dough treat that My tummy can tolerate! I also love the thyme fries and Brussels sprouts!  I have gone out of my way to eat here.  Please put a location in N. Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I think the last time I dined here was my last.  I always feel gross after ingesting items off of their soy-filled menu. So, I tried a salad and was utterly disappointed.  When it comes down to it, I'd rather spend my money on real food, not fake meat and fake cheese and fake this and that.    Keep it real...er...well, you just keep it."}
{"text":"Some of the best veggi/vegan food around & def the best here in AZ. Are you unsure of what meat substitutes are or taste like?  Green really nails it...& their fake 'chicken' is seriously some of the best Ive had across the country ---- try the OG Poo Boy sandwich, a spicy buffalo 'chicken' sandwich on a sub roll (so delicious) or I usually get the Ranchero Salad Buffalo wing style instead of BBQ.  Seriously I cant go there without getting the Buffalo anything!  Check out their new location in Phoenix on 7th st ---- with their dessert cafe next door, 'Nami' you can get fantastic vegan pastries, Soynami's (vegan version of Dairy Queens blizzard), cupcakes, coffee & more!!! SO GREAT! +++"}
{"text":"Yummy vegan treats! Not the most healthy but tasty and meat free."}
{"text":"i'm glad we finally have a veggie restaurant in central phoenix!  i think it was a void that really needed to be filled and i can see myself ending up here often when i am looking for a quick and healthy option.  i haven't tried enough of their menu yet to comment on the best dishes, but the atmosphere, location and prices are great!  i was only moderately impressed with my first meal, but i think i may have chosen incorrectly for my taste - they have LOTS of options so i'll be able to tweak it next time!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying (based on the number of wing spots I've eaten at in my life) I NEVER thought I would write the following words.  THIS IS A GREAT VEGETARIAN WING!  Yes, I'm a purist but based on my fellow Yelpers, I had to give this a try. No - they don't look like wings but they are truly amazing, great flavor, with a nice texture.  Saved room for a chicken sandwich & loved it as well.  Friendly staff & nice open air locale.  All you carnivores, give it a try - you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"A great and convenient stop when you're craving vegan comfort food. This location is much better appointed and more comfortable to dine in than the Tempe location. However, they could use some additional parking. Also, I could swear the meal portions (specifically the noodle dishes) have gotten smaller, especially for takeout."}
{"text":"OK so this is my first review in a very long time, but I just can't keep quiet any longer. My husband is a big yelper but sometimes he does not tell the whole \"truth\".  So the other night, my Husband decided we should try something totally different and go \"Green\". I love trying new places, I was down for the challenge. As usual, I went onto to YELP and looked at reviews. They were pretty positive, so it was a go.  Well first of all I think people are just not honest. The ONLY reason to go to this restautant is if you are a vegan otherwise stay away.   First of all, we walk in and it is chaos. A nice sign indicating please seat yourself or order at counter would be very helpful. So we look over the menu. I have to admit the idea of \"mock\" meat just does not sound good.  Now don't get me wrong I go vegetarian all the time at restaurants. I have to admit that Chelsea's Kitchen makes an excellent black bean burger. Anyways, we start off with mock chicken wings, I would be lieing if I did not tell you I think I might have vomited a little in my mouth. So gross.   Next, we try some artichoke dip, that was actually good because it was semi normal. I order the veggie burger. I have eaten plenty of boca burgers in  my day, but this was just gross. WHen I order a veggie burger I don't need it to look like an actual burger patty. It was pink inside. Again, I could not even eat it, I thought I was going to be sick. If I wanted to get an actual burger, I would have gone to LGO and gotten a burger.  Needless to say, I will not be going back. Just riddle me this, if you don't eat me then why do you insist in making your food appear as meat??? I don't like tuna fish, and the last thing I would want is my steak to look and smell like tuna fish!!"}
{"text":"Fifth time here and it keeps getting better, if that is at all possible.  Service is outstanding, the food is nutritious and very delicious.  Their Sunday brunch in conjunction with Nami next door is fun and very tasty (think waffles and mimosas)  So far I have tried their spicy buffalo wings, the thyme fries, the wendy's pickle (twice!), the tahini cole slaw, and the thai peanut bowl.  They were all fresh and very tasty.  The portions are also quite generous, and we usually end up taking home some really good left overs. The vibe in the restaurant is wonderful too, people are happy and all appear as satisfied as I feel right now.  If I lived closer, I think I would be a daily customer---they are that good."}
{"text":"Green recently changed their menu and it all went downhill. Prices are more expensive and the new dishes tasted bad. Both times everything was very salty. The parking at Green was always terrible and now \"but the food is really good\" isn't a reason to deal with the terrible parking. I am not going back to waste my money on a third time."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've visited twice and selected the (lemon?) pesto with chicken both times. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Their salads are bomb, their drink selection is awesome, and the chicken is the best! It's so hard to believe that what I am eating is vegetarian- tastes so much like the real thing!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by last week for a quick lunch. I got the hot wings to go. They were AWESOME and tasted exactly like meat! The sauce was delish and I loved that they served it with celery, pickles, and carrots (as wings should be).  The place was swamped when I arrived, so I understand why the girl at the front wasn't super smiley-- but she definitely didn't make me or the other customers feel welcome, and she wasn't terribly knowledgeable about the menu when a group had questions.  I would go back to try other items, though. Definitely a great option in the heart of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great dive vegan spot. Awesome place for the unhealthy vegan or the healthy vegan that wants to just say f it and eat some tasty food. Not everything is good though so you kinda gotta try a few things.  Big wac or whatever they call it is disgusting. Wendy's sandwich is decent."}
{"text":"Over 30 minutes to get the two most simple sandwiches on the menu. People that cane at least 5-10 minutes after are eating and finishing and leaving. Complained twice but was also blown off twice. It was not busy when I put in my order so no reason for it to be this slow when it's typically 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Would've been 5 star if we didn't have to bus a table to get a seat, that being said, everything else was awesome.  Food was great, we went with the burger and and the cheese steak. The burger was by far the best vegan burger I've ever had, stands up against some of the best \"real\" burgers I've ever had. The cheese steak was impressive as well. When ordering I initially ordered it without cheese, but the server informed me that everything on the menu was vegan. Points for that.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. I wish we had a location in Toronto. I stopped in last week during a layover and I've been craving the Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\" ever since. Definitely some of the best vegan wings I have ever had.  I was with a friend during my visit and we also shared the Wendy's Pickle and Thee Green Salad. Although Wendy's Pickle is simple without many toppings it was super tasty. The salad was delicious as well, but I wouldn't care to order it again. Hoping to go back again one day. When I do I will order everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian for about 2.5 years, I really enjoy this place. Their standing menu items are delicious and their daily special is usually good to try if it sounds appealing. The mock chicken is so good it is hard to tell it is not real chicken. The thyme French fries are yummy and go with everything on the menu. For dessert, walk next door to Nami.   Love it!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town for Spring Training and found this place on Yelp.  It was so good we came two days in a row!  The first day I had the secret bbq sammie and we shared the spinach fundido dip.  The bbq flavor on the sammie was delicious and I loved their mock chicken.  The fundido dip was literally the best spinach dip I've had since giving up dairy.  The second day I had to try the Big Wac and animal fries.  The burger was delicious and the fries were amazing.  We also enjoyed the selection of local beer.  After dinner, we shared some tsoynamis and then I fell into a food coma for the next 12 hours.  I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The big WAC is the best thing on their menu by far...with chili cheese fries. Holy cow that is what I live for. The salads and bowls aren't my fav, but I don't go their for that... I go their for the guuuuuuud stuff."}
{"text":"Yum! As a recent vegetarian, this has become a go to place for lunch. It is a funky little place with some interested artwork. Very cool atmosphere that reminds me of Santa Cruz,CA. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Order at the counter. Eat in or to-go. I have had the brussel sprout salad which is so tasty as well as in burrito form. I have not yet tried the veg meat offerings since I have an allergy to tofu/soy. I am excited to try some new things over the next few months!  So glad I found this funky little gem!"}
{"text":"Good vegan junk food.  Honestly, stay away from the healthier-sounding items - most of it that I've had tastes nowhere near as good as the sauce-drenched fried seitan sandwiches."}
{"text":"Triple chocolate Tsoynami.......love!!!   Greens. I love everything I have tried here.  I have tagged along to Tempe several with hubs on \"work\" meeting trips and I really glad that I did, would have never discovered Greens.  Its funny EVERY time we see our omni friend he mentions the Big Wac (which is a similar version of Doomie's Big Mac only WAYYYY better) at Greens! Super funny, soon I will hear of a omni driving to Tempe via Vegas to get a Big Wac.   I always get the Buffalo Chkn' sandwich which is similar to Garden Grill.   Its a cute little casual place and the service has always been fast and friendly.  I really need to try different things when I come here next time.......but our standard choices......always fulfill!!!!   5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am really glad that I visited Green during my recent Phoenix trip. It was such an amazing dinner. They had so many different options on the menu, so it was hard to decide what to try. I ended up with the BFF, which is a mock chicken sandwich with cheese, jalapenos, and ranch, all vegan. It was incredible. The meal was a little pricey because fries were extra, but it was well worth it. (I am confused why they were called thyme fries, too, as they didn't appear to have thyme on them.) Having read other reviews, I plan to return to try to Wac Burger. My mouth is just watering remembering my time at Green. Mmm..."}
{"text":"Very good! I had the Sesame Dragon and Eggless Rolls. The rolls were amazing! Crisp and hot even though it was carry out! The sesame dragon was ok- veggies were crisp but there wasn't a lot of flavor. I will definitely try them again. Great and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Was a loyal customer. Bad customer service. Ran poorly management. If an order is wrong or if you've had a bad experience, expect a shrug and a half hearted \"yeah, we'll address that/sorry but don't care bye\""}
{"text":"I had no idea that there was a Green Restaurant so close to me!  I must say that I prefer the location in Phoenix as far as decor even tho this is the original.  I took my meat eating friend and he loved his special.  As usual the food was great, but I decided to try something different this time and got a Chai Tiramisu Tsoynami.  Note: As I was warned by the server, it tastes nothing like Tiramisu (which is my favorite dessert), but I got it anyway.  It was interesting....it had crushed animal crackers and a taste of ginger.  It was fine but I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Out of towners: I don't understand what the big hype is. The rice bowls were quite disappointing. The rice was drenched in the sauce and the veggies weren't cooked all the way. The flavors were off as if everything is cooked separately and warmed up in the sauce. We just expected better from the high ratings."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The best mock-chicken i've ever had - totally addicted :-)"}
{"text":"The one lonely star is for the ambiance and decor, which I did find appealing.  We ordered a pizza and KP noodle bowl. I got my noodles quickly and actually finished the dish before we realized that the pizza had not arrived. Went up to the counter to find out that the cook had burned the pizza and had not started another one, so we went ahead and ordered another noodle dish. 20 minutes later they brought the wrong dish with ingredients specifically asked not to include. The manager gave us 3 dollars back as the pizza was actually $5 more and did apologize, but by then we where to tired to ask for a full refund."}
{"text":"I loooove it here!  So unfair (echoing a lot of people from CA's reviews) that the Phoenix area would have a place like this and not the Bay Area-- home of hippie cuisine!  For me this place has been a salvation from Spring Training baseball fare and the general heaviness of eating around here (so much bar/grill and mexican... good stuff, just not 3 meals a day!).  I've really enjoyed their crab puffs, pesto pizza, sweet & sour mock chicken bowl, salads.. and those tosynamis! yum!  At first I thought they were smoothies, but they're really more like soy soft serve ice-cream sundaes with mixers in them.  Tasty.  The prices are amazing for such \"novelty\" fare.  I noticed they have 100% biodegradable cutlery too which I think is awesome.  Wish I could put this place in the trunk and bring it back to CA."}
{"text":"All you need to know, THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. All around.  The atmosphere of Green is artistic, fun and comfortable. Had you never heard anything about this place before, from the view outside Green you would most likely drive right on by. Its also kind of hidden but that hasn't slowed down their business one little bit and here is why. THE FOOD IS KILLER. Seriously.  The staff was super friendly, they serve and offer vegetarian food as well as all natural beverages, organic, vegetarian and vegan shelf foods to take home. While there I had a kombucha tea to drink, my boyfriend had an all natural cola and we shared the chili fries and the apricot miso bowl with fresh tofu. The portions were great and we were super full after. We spent around $21 after both food items, drinks and tip. Not bad! Especially for fresh, vegetarian ingredients that fill you up.  A fun and delicious time. If you are visiting AZ, make a trip for sure."}
{"text":"This is probably my most frequented restaurant. The food is awesome - it's unique, fresh and quick - and the service is great. There may be a line... it might be really long, but you can also order takeout online.  I always get a salad and something else - favorites are the Ultimo Taco, Big Wac, and Buffalo \"Wings\". Their beer, cider, and wine selection is the best out of all the local vegan restaurants too."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but my cousin is so I took her here. I was a little hesitant at first but the food here is delicious! I got the BFF, which was messy but delicious, and she got a rice bowl which was also amazing. Cute little place that has a hippie chic feel to it!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here.   Very busy place.   They're related to the Nomi vegan restaurant.  I had their veggie burger the first time and it was decent.   Last night I had the orange chicken rice bowl with mock chicken.   It was a combination of cabbage, carrots, broccoli, rice, sauce, and some tofu chicken.   It wasn't too bad.  The broccoli could've been cut up smaller.  Oh, and we shared some French fries with mock cheese and onions.   That was the best part of the meal... great tasting fries!!  I was impressed!!   Not a big selection of non alcoholic drinks... some stevia cokes, waters, etc.  I believe they served beers and a few drinks."}
{"text":"In a city full of meat-eaters, it is refreshing to have vegan options out in the restaurant sphere. I tend to get anything with noodles when here. Though what I've eaten has been good, I find all of their dishes too salty and will have to ask for less sel next time I visit. Further, there are so many vegan dishes out in the world; I feel they are playing their menu safe and should look globally for unique, ethnic, inspiration. On a more positive note: their \"ice cream/milk shakes\" are delish--don't even realize there's no dairy."}
{"text":"Very flavorful vegan food-hipster approved (; They have yummy vegan desserts as well."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have eaten there several times and mix it up every time and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This isn't just a place to go if your vegan (which I'm not), it's a place to go for super delicious food.  I've been several times and I've loved everything on the menu.  I wouldn't assume just because it's vegan that it's \"healthy\" necessarily, since some of their stuff seems pretty indulgent, but I don't care - it's great eating.  I like the vibe of the place too, and you can get some tasty treats next door at Nami too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Green.  The food is off the chain.  I love the decor!  Its framework is a garage.  This place is just as good as Red Bamboo (my fave vegan spot in NYC).  The first time I came to Green was in October.  I had the Spicy Buffalo Wings (they sure are spicy and SALTY!) and the Sweet and Sour bowl.  The bowl was very fresh, love the variety of veggies.  My friend had the Thai Peanut Bowl and loved it.  This time around I had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich with the Thyme fries - amazing!  The Vimto is the TRUTH!  I seriously need to go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. They recently changed menus and i went last week to try it and the service was horrible i waited an hour for my food to be ready and when i got it, not a single meal was correct and the lady up front was rude. Not returning however i do recommend nami right next door they sale their pastries there and they are amazing and very kind!!"}
{"text":"Veg comfort food...SWEET.  My husband and I are doing this detox thing with no gluten too, and they had tons of things on the menu we could have ordered.  He was laughing at me (I've been a back and forth vegetarian/pescatarian for 5 years - always one or the other) as I went through the menu online going \"oooh!  oh my god....oooh!\"  It is a rare treat for me to find a place where I can eat EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu, without any modifications needing to be made.  We got carryout and it was certainly a bit of a drive from Central Phoenix (2nd location, please?  :)), but it was totally worth it.  I can't wait to try nearly everything on the menu.  Is it greasy?  Probably.  Is it health food?  No.  Is it awesome?  You bet.    P.S. I got the Mongolian Rice Noodle Bowl with Mock Chicken, and he got the Drunken Chicken w/Rice Noodles."}
{"text":"Well I've only had one meal here so far... but holy crap I loved it! I was basic as all get-out and just ordered the cheeseburger with fries--really wanted some junk food/comfort food--and it was DELISH. If I hadn't ordered it myself and nobody told me it was vegan, I wouldn't have known the difference. SO GOOD! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I went there today for lunch and it was terrific! My daughter has a ton of food allergies so it is tough to find allergy friendly places in town. My husband and I are not vegan but have to tell you the food was fantastic and the service was fast and the restaurant was packed. Great experience! Don't forget to go next door to Nami for dessert afterwards!!"}
{"text":"Green is really excellent food in many respects. Seriously good food.  But I have one bone to pick with the menu (is that a bad phrase to use for a vegetarian restaurant?): it needs more selections that truly celebrate the vegetable. Almost everything available is mock beef, fake chicken and faux pork. That's fine, I guess, especially for recent vegetarian meat-eaters who are missing some of the old textures and flavors. But for long-time veggies - and even for carnivores like me looking for variety - the menu could stand to have a few more dishes celebrating beans and mushrooms and soy and all the other incredible flora that are just fine being themselves and not pretending to be flesh.  It's better that way - and, let's face it, that veggie burger is never going to taste as good as the real burger if that's what you are really after."}
{"text":"World class vegetarian in PHX! Had the chicken artichoke salad, boneless wings, chili fries, and eggless rolls. Top ten on Happy Cow!"}
{"text":"Well ... based off of so many positive Yelp reviews and considering how packed the place was when I visited, I must try it again. For me, the food was only okay... perhaps I should have tried the special of the day. In fact, it was highly suggested that I try the special of the day (street tacos) but because it was my first time I wanted to try the local favorite, one of the most popular items on the menu, the buffalo chicken wings. So that's what I ordered.  I waited a very long time for just one order of buffalo wings. The buffalo sauce was amazing, but cold, so was the wings. They tasted like they've been sitting back there for a while and forgotten about. I ate 2, ate the carrots and cucumbers that accompanied the wings and left the rest of the wings there. They were cold anyway. I opted not to get a to go box because I just didn't like them very much. I imagined if I would have taken them home to heat up they would have taste worse.   The restaurant was wayyyyyy too busy for me not to give them another try. Something's gotta be good! Next time I think I'll try their version of the Big Mac"}
{"text":"I ordered the most unoriginal food here which was a veggie burger, I should have went for the \" philly cheese steak\" but I chickened out. Next time for sure! The burger was good, I really enjoyed it along with the rosemary fries. I will keep coming back, and try the tacos next time. New favorite spot to hit up."}
{"text":"I am shocked and amazed at how delicious our food was, since going vegan the only meat I have missed WAS chicken wings, not anymore, the \"chicken\" wings at Green are every bit as tasty if not tastier and certainly greener and happier than real chicken wings! Pure heaven!  I also enjoyed the chili and my husband loved his sandwich.  We will be returning, frequently.  We also stopped into the vegan ice cream store next door and it was also outstanding, what a great addition to this community!  service was also well above average, I am talking about outstanding, I had a ton of questions and she gladly answered them all."}
{"text":"Amazing food, really it was better than I'd thought plant based could be. Had the Big Wac and the 'cheesesteak' sandwich and was really pleased with both. Great drink selection too. Sangria was on point!   Coulda done without the pentagrams and Satan themed art on the walls, not sure why that was necessary. The clientele seems like a combination of people who appreciate that kinda art and the afterparty from an REI garage sale, but the food was fantastic.  Also, get the Animal Fries! Probably tastier than in and out."}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Super customer service. Unique Idea. Delicious fries and soy blizzard type dessert.  But, the vegan burgers that my husband and I  ordered were tasteless and borderline \"gross\". I couldn't eat 3/4 of it, and threw it away. Still, in the future I might give it another shot."}
{"text":"I love Green, but my stomach doesn't.   The last few times I have eaten here I have left feeling greasy, bloated, and fat.  I think this proves the point that JUST BECAUSE ITS VEGAN DOESN'T MEAN ITS HEALTHY!!  I wish Green had healthier and freshier options.  Maybe some kind of local quinoa salad?  Interesting daily soups? Their salads are pretty pathetic, with their \"mixed greens\" resembling something that came out of a bag from Fry's.  However, Green IS delicious.  I would classify their hot wings as one of  my favorite foods ever, and I am always very happy whilst eating their creations."}
{"text":"Yummmm.. The absolute best vegan joint in Phoenix! Even people who aren't vegan will like it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch the other day and I can say I was pretty impressed.  It's kind of hard to spot since it's in the corner of a very small and crowded parking lot, but don't let that deter you.  I liked the decor and the setup of the restaurant.  Our food came out very fast and was pretty awesome.  I got the orecciette pasta with the \"meatballs\".  I'm not a fan of fake meats.  If you are going to be vegetarian I say just be vegetarian, but the meatballs in the pasta were more like falafel and were great.  I will definitely be back when I make it to the side of town again.  Try:  orecciette pasta"}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time last night, and I ordered Wendy's pickle and an order of the buffalo wings.  LOVED them both.  Very tasty - lots of flavor.  The one knock on this place is seating.  It is very limited, and so if want to have a great seat be there early.  We arrived at 8 pm and the place was still packed on a Tuesday night!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZE-BALLS. It was my cousin's birthday and this is like the one vegan place in town so we decided to go. The food was delicious, especially the vegan buffalo wings! The only problem is that we went as a group and everyone got their food at really weird times. 3 of us were done eating before the others were even served. Besides that, it was great. Lovely concept and a fun, quirky store."}
{"text":"yes, i'm a vegetarian. no, i don't like meat-flavored, meat-shaped vegetable protein that tricks me into thinking i'm eating meat. if i wanted meat, i'd eat meat. that said, there are plenty of delicious vegetarian dishes that feature vegetables in their natural state here, and they're good."}
{"text":"The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant.   I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.   So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:  *Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.  *Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!  *Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.  *Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!  Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.   Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.    Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date."}
{"text":"+Big Wag burger is as close to a Big Mac as it gets. +big plus for the mock icecream blizzards. +peach blizzard"}
{"text":"This place alone makes me want to move to Phoenix! I would be there all the time.  It's got a similar set up to Panera - you order at the counter and then they bring your food out to you. The food came out within a reasonable time.  The best and worst part about going to vegetarian restaurants is that I literally want everything on the menu. I ended up trying the buffalo wings and the \"big mac\" which were both AMAZING. I don't typically like when vegan/vegetarian foods try to be like meat, but they did a fantastic job. The wings had a great sauce and the burger was a dressed up vegetarian burger. A lot of food, but I managed to finish it all. Delicious.  If you are a vegetarian and you're in Phoenix this place is a must!! Come to New York please!!"}
{"text":"Green's makes vegan cool.   Seriously cool.  Your options go far beyond salads!  Here you can enjoy a full flavor, comfort food dish...all in good health and consciousness!  Burgers, sandwiches, \"WINGS\"?! need I say more?"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is busy so it's obviously a thriving local business and doing very well. The atmosphere is trendy, it has a very hipster \"vibe\" going on and the staff was overall friendly and helpful.   Now about the food. I ordered the Big WAC, which was surprisingly delicious, although a bit greasy (kept dripping in the basket). The thyme fries were good. My husband had the BBQ burger, which he said tasted like cardboard with a layer of sauce which made it...in his words \"edible\". He made a good point that without the \"special sauce\" mine probably would've tasted pretty bland too. My little one had the kids \"burger\" and fries. He didn't realize it wasn't real meat, so that was good :) My other one wasn't as adventurous and just wanted a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. I happened to notice on the receipt they upcharged us 50 cents to add cucumber (really, $6.50 for lettuce, cucumber and dressing?). Anyways. Kids wanted a chocolate chip cookie for $2 each, which they both said tasted good but a bit dry. I ordered the Banana Cream pie Tsoynami, which I highly recommend. It was huge so you may want to share it. I may have to stop back for another if I'm in the area sometime, but I highly doubt we're going back for the food anytime soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  We tried their Chicago Cheesesteak, Big Wac, Animal Fries, Karma Curry Rice Bowl, and Buffalo \"Wings,\" and every dish was delicious.  The burgers were actually so good and juicy that I hesitated to ask my vegetarian friend to try.  The favorite at the table was the Karma Curry Rice Bowl which had crunchy vegetables and soft/dense fried tofu pieces.  Everything was very rich and flavorful, not the stereotypical vegetarian blandness that most would expect.  Also, for vegetarian food, this place is quite affordable!  Would definitely return to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"After an MRI and some great drugs My girlfriend  thought this would be the best time to persuade me into some Vegan food, not gonna lie though, that BBBQ Bacon burger was on point and the crab puffs were bangin too! Tip: Always get the house sauce, it's crazy good!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! The Big Wac tasted just like a Big Mac! The boneless chicken wings were amazing! We can't stay away from this place!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some hungry guy friends...did not disappoint anyone!!  Amazing flavor profiles and it was healthy filling food.  Just enough spice to make you appreciate the fun drinks, green tea, lemonade and some weird sweet fruit punch..so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Best dang restaurant.  I literally crave the Big Wac when I'm at home.  Whhyyyyyyyy do you do this to me Green!? And the fish tacos, and the Kung Pao bowl, and the buffalo chickn and the Tsoynamis and the...  I could go on and on  I don't think I've had one thing here I didn't like.  Great vibe here, neat people, really great staff.  It definitely could be bigger though, I've had to race people to tables sometimes!!"}
{"text":"Love how there is place with an array of vegetarian and vegan options. Ordered the brussel sprout wrap and opted to have it on a bed of lettuce which was a wonderful modification. The only thing to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to find parking."}
{"text":"Great vegan place! We got quite a few items by accident. We ordered the crab puffs, cheesesteak with chili on the side, wack burger, the classic burger with brown rice on the side, and the dragon bowl--for only two people, lol. The crab puffs were okay, but I wouldn't order them again (too greasy and only get 4). The cheesesteak was fricken amazing--had bell peppers, jalapeños, \"cheese,\" and was even appropriately greasy. The chili was decent and topped with wonton strips. My husband had the burgers on Ezekiel buns (score for Ezekiel bread!) and said they were better than the beyond burger. I tried a bite and they were pretty good. The dragon bowl was okay, but rather salty, so we probably wouldn't try that again. All in all, delicious!"}
{"text":"You know what, I like it. It's good, it's fun - the flavors are interesting. My favorite thing is their Soynamis though! Delicious! And so many different ways you can make it. Ambience is okay - the way I see it is I can be surrounded by snooty vegans or snooty carnivores at some fancy schmancy restaurant - either way, the two extremes seem to have the same sort of \"air\" about them. So I'm not so crazy about who I'm sharing my meal with, but if the meal is good, I am down with it. Service ain't to shabby - not the best, they seem ocassionally bothered that they have to take your order or that you're not entirely sure what you want, but when you give a person a multitude of ways to make things, you're gonna ask, is this gluten-free, is this dairy-free, etc. You'd think they'd be use to those questions by now. But overall, a definite must-try for the adventurous, and staple to my list of faves."}
{"text":"Tsoynamis are the bomb. Seriously the best thing in this restaurant. On the other hand, I have had other things on the menu and they have always been ok...but I seem to always feel sick after eating there.  However, the vibe in the restaurant is very chill and not really snotty or pretentious. and I enjoy their drink options. The lemonade and the tea is really good.   Green, you are a good place for vegans and veggies to go but as far as the rest of us, I guess we just have to get used to the mock meat and tofu."}
{"text":"good food - ben there several times. avoid the lentil burger it was weird and did not hold a burger shape. everything else was pretty good that I had esp. the daily specials"}
{"text":"Great food! Innovative and DELISH!! Also loved the ginger beer! It's was so crowded we couldn't find a spot to sit but the staff were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I eat here once or twice a week now. The big wac or Wendy's pickle are awesome. The soynamis are just as good as ice cream. Love. This. Place."}
{"text":"I absolutely am in love with this restaurant! They have amazing food and will make it the way you like if you have any preferences. I try to order a different item every time I go and so far I have not been disappointed. My favorite meal has been the po boy mock chicken sandwich with thyme fries. The crab puffs are also amazing. The food is filling yet light, doesn't sit in your stomach for the rest of the day, and I always feel satisfied. The hang out, casual feel of the restaurant is enjoyable and the employees are very friendly willing to offer suggestions. They also have really cool art on around the restaurant. As a vegan this restaurant is a haven for me and I recommend it to fellow vegans and meat-eaters alike! My family has vegetarians and nonveg and we all enjoy coming here. The ice cream, tsoynamis, are my favorite dessert of all time. You can get soft serve or a full sized tsoynami which have different mix ins. Cookie dough, chocolate cake, and pie are just a few of their mix ins."}
{"text":"This is incredible I just ordered crab puffs and big wac + thyme fries and scottsdale blonde. I cannot believe this is actually a vegan restaurant. There should be one of these in every major city. It is very chill, no blaring music, calm environment. I will be back again & have already recommended this to friends. Get off your device and come, I promise it's worth it."}
{"text":"After leaving the valley for 3 years, I can honestly say--I'm thrilled to be back!! I literally was craving the tsoynami something terrible. I often drive way too far to have one. The entire menu is incredible, and the girl who had been the cashier my last two visits, Kate, is fantastic! Always smiling and so helpful. I've been in this industry for over a decade, and it's easy to see she definitely deserves a shout out. It's amazing to see someone who takes such great care of people with such a great attitude. This place is such a gem, I am admittedly obsessed. Also, vegan animal fries??! Stop it! So good."}
{"text":"My favorite AZ vegan place, easily. If you're vegan, there's not a thing on the menu you won't like. If you're not vegan, the same's true but I'd definitely recommend the sandwiches over anything else for a newbie. The mock meats and cheeses will blow you away. Be prepared to always get dessert here, it's hard not to be tempted and it's all delicious. Overall, will always recommend, great for vegans and non-vegans."}
{"text":"If you're a Vegan or Vegetarian you absolutely MUST eat here. It's tucked away and parking is limited but we have never had a problem finding a spot. Their menu is extensive - I've had the BBQ po-boy with mock chicken and the Big Wac. Both were outstanding. The thyme fries are delicious. You also have the option of fresh fruit. They have a great selection of craft brews and wine on tap. You order up front and the food never takes more than 5 mins to be delivered to you. We live in Cave Creek and make the 40 minute drive down here bc it is THAT good. And don't even get me started on Nami, their sister bakery directly next door. Out. Of. This. World. Good."}
{"text":"This is my new comfort food one-stop-shop. I used to drop in Coco's next door when I wanted something fast and easy, but now I go to Green and get something GOOD as well.  I can't resist the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, but ALL the sandwiches and po'boys are well worth the trip."}
{"text":"As an on-again, off-again vegetarian, I really value culinary experiences that are so good, or so interesting, that I don't miss meat. Green doesn't quite meet (meat?) this standard: though they make some of the best meatless meat dishes in town, I still catch myself thinking, \"This would be even better if it was made of beef and bacon.\" Their imitation beef and chicken are impressively like the real things, but that's the fundamental problem (in my humble opinion) with this style of vegetarian cuisine: no matter how good you make it, \"like the real thing\" is never gonna beat the real thing. Their veggie burgers are tasty, but burgers are tastier. Soynamis are pretty good, but milkshakes will always be better. I know that New American is their thing, but I think Green would be even better if they took a little more inspiration from traditions like Indian and Middle Eastern, which have done spectacular things without meat for thousands of years.  None of this, of course, means I won't continue to eat here pretty frequently. I love their egglessrolls, poboys (both Original and Argentine... especially the Argentine with extra chimichurri sauce). Their thyme fries are pretty good, but I don't really taste the thyme. I've gotten a couple bowls, which have been good but a little sparse on the mock meat. A cheap and delicious option is to get a side of lo mein with some mock beef."}
{"text":"I've gone to Green on several occasions. Food is always fantastic. I get the Buffalo \"wings\" and the \"Big Wac\" usually.  Prices are a tad high, but not really for being in Scottsdale, and for the unique kind of food they offer.  I will give two criticisms. First, I often go with my non-vegetarian wife, and I will have to say their choice of foods for her is very limited.  I'm not saying they should offer non-vegan foods, but I'm saying they could add a few more \"normal\" non-meat choices.  Maybe a few more salads, a veggie pizza, etc.  She had the Mac & Cheese which is something that might attract someone like my wife, and even I will have to say, it wasn't very good.   Second, the cleanliness of the place, and the overall feeling of the place could be improved.   While there seems to be all types inside, and it has a distinctive hippy vibe. If you don't have a nose ring and dreadlocks it gets easy to feel out-of-place, which is a shame because the food is very good.  Still, I do feel they should invest a bit more time in atmosphere improvements.  I know my food doesn't contain cows or pigs, but I'd like a bit more confidence that it doesn't include bug parts."}
{"text":"Green is fantastic vegan junk food, and I'm not even vegan. Everything I've tried has been good or great. The Thai Peanut is my favorite to date. Oh and the thyme fries are a killer must-try."}
{"text":"Great food! The service was horrible and it is very expensive. The good thing is the food was so good that I will eat there again and again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vegan spot to eat, this is it. They have a variety of vegan dishes, primarily a mock chicken which is great. They also have a mock steak. Everything is vegan. It's can get pricey since none of the sandwiches come with a side. I think that's something they can work on but overall it's a good place to eat."}

{"text":"I ate the Big Wac (vegan-simulated big mac with tofu patties). The burger was as close as you could get to simulating this McD burger. But the real thing isn't even close to tasting like real meat either, so the flavorless tofu patties didn't have to accomplish much. It was very large and falling apart, so I had to toss the middle bun to eat it. I was impressed with their dairy-free thousand island, not too shabby. Their thyme fries were great. Dropped a couple of stars because the food wasn't fantastic, and the girl behind the counter wasn't friendly."}
{"text":"Even a non veggo can come to Green and enjoy one of their many authentic  vegan friendly meals.   Whether you're looking for a healthy bite with some friends or just grabbing a  tSoynami as a treat, you'll leave green with a smile on your face. I usually combine a mix of pretzels, chocolate, caramel & marshmallow but the choices are infinite. use your imagination and create something to suit your taste bud needs.  I must admit, i dont fancy their eco friendly recycled utensils. I feel as though they leave that cardboard flavored taste in your mouth that i've never seemed to enjoy much. Then again, it's a price im willing to pay to go GREEN.   The vegan chocolate peanut butter bars found by the register are a delicious treat to take on the go. I've always wanted to get one of the many psychedelic coloring books provided by local artists but at  around $20.00 cost, I've yet to splurge my student income. I suggest checking this place out. Whether you need a quick feed after yoga, a snack on the run, or even take-out for dinner, Greens the place to go.  There are always positive vibes flowing and the helpful employees make it an enjoyable atmosphere to kick back and relax."}
{"text":"They call it new American because American's are known for fast food. Don't think you're getting healthy if you go to green, you're getting vegan American fast food.   While I have enjoyed meals here time and time again, I must admit I only return for the scene and nami next door.   My friend Cole and I shared a big wack and the wings but I enjoyed my beer most of all. Yeah, they serve beer here now :) I tried Mr. Pineapple a few weeks back and ordered this but Cole had no problem telling me it was light and not strong enough for his taste buds.. Who would have thought that the meat eater would be a bigger pussy than the vegan? It's okay though, I'm a girl who likes beer so I'll give myself a pat on the back for that.   Anyway, after dinner we went next door where my friend Mariah served us up so vegan treats. I originally tried making up my own Tsoynami creation but after a few minutes I just let her surprise me. WOW was I surprised and pleasantly so. She made a strawberry cheese cake creation with nilla wafers and strawberries YUM. We also got a banana muffin with peanut butter frosting that was ORGASMIC.   If you've got a sweet tooth and you're like me / try to stay away from dairy, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great Vegan food! Casual and cute! We need more local joints like this! Especially for the vegan / health conscious population! I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"very good! although i am not a veggie i still like the food! their pastry place located in phoenix (NAMI) is super delicious too! LOVE the environment and great customer service"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but it's good and for what it's worth to buy at vegan restaurants, this place is cheaper than other restaurants. Their desserts are amazing; always try the Tsoynami if you come here."}
{"text":"Great food; friendly staff.  Even non-vegans would love it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had previously LOVED going here. One of my favorite people EVER works here. That person is still AMAZING! This place is 5 minutes from my work and as a vegetarian, a welcome spot to grab food! (At least it used to be.)  The problem is the \"new\" menu. All my favorites are gone. If I want a bowl, it's no longer available over noodles, only rice. The sides are a la carte and not included with the choices now.   The other reviews of poor service are warranted. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. The worst part was I saw the expediter eating french fries off the plate of someone's food just before running it out. GROSS!   Time to find a new place for my 'go-to' lunch spot. :-("}
{"text":"I had only one night in Phoenix to catch up with one of my oldest and dearest friends and based on reviews and the menu, I decided to go to Green Restaurant. Green is a 100% vegan restaurant that features new American-style comfort food. They also try to use organic ingredients when possible. But, it was really the chef's statement on the website that made me want to visit. It is owned by Damon Brasch, a vegan chef and restauranteur who is now living his dream by having opened this restaurant. He wanted to create a menu that would please any palate and that was influenced by many different cultures and cooking styles.  And it was so successful that there are now two locations as well as a separate vegan dessert place called \"Nami.\"  My friend alerted me that it was a very casual place so I was prepared to dine super casual on this Friday night. When we arrived around 8 p.m., it was packed and there was just enough seating for our group so we snagged it right away. We took a look at the menu for a long time. As everything is vegan, it was very difficult for me to choose what I wanted. The menu features appetizers, bowls, salads, sammies & burgers, and sides so there was a lot to choose from.  I was also pleased to see that they served beer and wine as well. Once we made our selections, we ordered at the counter, then sat down and waited for our food.  I started with a locally brewed beer -- Four Peaks Peach Ale. Then, our appetizers started arriving. First, we had the green hummus made of garlic, poblano chilies, and chickpeas with fried pita. This one was a winner.  Next,we had the spicy buffalo wings, which were probably my favorite item from the whole night. They were tender with great spice and served with a delicious vegan cucumber ranch.  Our last appetizer was the samosas filled with curried potatoes, peas, carrots, and garlic served with a tamarind dipping sauce. These were okay, but nothing to write home about.  For my entree, I ordered the Clexico Burger. This was their homemade burger with organic garbanzo hummus, cheddar cheese, mayo, and spicy chipotle sauce. The burgers were a bit too meaty for me and not vegetably enough, if you know what I mean. And there were no veggies -- no lettuce or tomato so it was just a lot of fake meat with a nice chipotle sauce. I thought the burger was good, but definitely not what I should have ordered given the other healthy options.  I ended up wishing I had ordered the Singapore orange bowl that my friend had. Filled with fresh broccoli, zucchini, and faux meat, it was delicious.  Another girl got the Coconut Curry Bowl filled with broccoli, zucchini, and potatoes in a curry sauce.  My out-of-town friends tried their famous version of a Big Mac, the Big WAC! This was way too much burger for me. It was two patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame bun just the way I remembered. I have to admit that it was good, just too meaty and too much.  In the end, I was so glad I chose this place. Though I wish I had ordered the fresh bowls, I was still satisfied with everything I tried and some items were exceptionally good. All of our bowls and sandwiches were about $9 so pretty cheap. And I love that they offer beer, wine, and soft serve ice cream. This place is a win-win."}
{"text":"I loved this vegan joint. They had a wide array of vegan sandwiches. I got the BBBQ sandwich which was amazing. Their juice bar is fantastic as well. My favorite was the black currant. Great friendly staff and great food. I also recommend going next door to get some tasty vegan ice cream!"}
{"text":"I love you, Green, I really do. It hurts to bitch about you, but you get 4stars anyway, cuz you still rock. I got the pita, and it was delicious! But, the pita was tough, and kinda hard twoards the end. That, and 2 pieces of artichoke doesn't cut it for me, especially when it says it's a main feature in the dish. I did mention it to the cashier, but that's all. I will order it again in hopes it will be better next time ;)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. I'm lactose intolerant and really miss ice cream and milkshakes. Green has the Tsoynami, a soft-serve soy ice cream Blizzard-like treat that quells my cravings. You can get different kinds of candy and fruit plus they always have some sort of special recipe involving cake or brownies and its always amazing. The food is delicious as well but I wish they'd bring back the pizza."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok.  Disappointing after reading most reviews.  We tried 5 different dishes and all were pretty bland. The best item was hummus.   Service was good and everyone was friendly, but the food just didn't stand out."}
{"text":"I used to love to eat in this place, but from the past months, they have increased the level of grease on all the dishes they offer. Last time I ask some Nachos at the location on Phoenix and literally they were full of grease. I end up throwing half of the nachos. Also, when you ask for a bowl, you get rice, 3 or 4 pieces of mock chicken or beef and tons of carrots and broccoli. They have been removing some dishes and deserts that were very good. Alfredo's bowl and also the soynami monsoon. Hope some day they get back with the quality that everybody expects. Last thing, most of the people that goes over there ask for a burger, I guess it is the best way to substitute McDonalds and burger king, but again you have too  start measuring the grease. We asked a BFF last week and my wife had to remove the crust. It was wet in grease"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been here many times, I'm somewhat of a regular here. Everything about this establishment is wonderful. It has a great vibe and it's a real fun place to meet with a friend or date. I've gone here with many non-vegans and no one has ever not fallen in love with this place. Their food is great. Almost everything on the menu is delicious. I recommend the buffalo wings and the Big Wac burger. They will convert any meat eater into a fan of this place. The staff is always friendly. Great customer service. This will always be my favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"I am not going to pretend I am a vegan anymore.  I look like a hipster, I smell like a hipster, and occasionally I eat like a hipster... so I have to eat some vegan stuff once in awhile.    I know that my vegan friends will not judge me for eating delicious little animals if I go with them to Green once in awhile.    When Thai food and salad bars are not enough, Green picks up the ball and paves the course for the future... providing a comfortable and hip atmosphere, great service, and mouthwatering delicious stomach stuffing.    I have eaten everything on the menu, and there is not a single thing on it I wouldn't order again, which I cannot say for any other eatery in the Valley.  But if I had to suggest something to a meat-eater that is venturing out into unknown territory, I would recommend \"Thee Argentine Po Boy\".    If you were raised by American McDonald's junkies like myself, and you are trying to change your eating habits, and you love to eat that ice cream cone after your McFeast, then feel free to hoof it over to Nami next door and satisfy the sweet tooth as well.  Thank you Green for making me feel a little less 1950's America in a ever-evolving world."}
{"text":"Menu looked amazing but I was pretty disappointed with the food here. I'm spoiled with Native Foods and Real Food Daily in LA.   We ordered:  Argentine poboy Chili cheese fries Chicken parm Coconut curry Kungpao  The chicken parm and chili cheese fries were the better ones. The bowls were the most disappointing ones as there is no sauce whatsoever - it was like food court stir fry. The house tofu didn't taste like tofu -- it's a bit on the chewier side, I wish I had ordered fresh tofu."}
{"text":"Not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I am a fan!  First note: if you are looking for this place, pay attention to the map BEFORE you get in the car.  It's in the corner of a strip mall and is VERY easy to miss.  It's just south of McKellips, for assistance.  You will see a low to the ground sign that just says GREEN.  Turn in there; the place is in the corner.  Very small, very unassuming.  I tried this out because I am lactose intolerant and decided to just try eating a vegan meal to ensure no dairy was in my food.  I got the Thai Peanut and a Soynami.    The portion was large enough that I was able to split it into two bowls when I got home.  I got my Thai Peanut with brown rice and fresh tofu.  Now, I already love tofu, and this dish was fantastic.  Absolutely one of the best stir-fry type dishes I have had with tofu.  In fact, I was surprised that 1) it was so good and 2) it was vegan.   It was the type of meal that you keep eating even though you can feel yourself getting full because it's just so good.  Ditto with the soynami.  The texture was interesting, which made it seem less watery than many soy based desserts that I get.  I got mine vanilla, with chocolate chips and sliced almonds, and it was perfect.  Another case of \"I'm really full and should stop eating but hell with it, I'm already crashed out on the couch anyway\"...I wish you could get a half soynami because half of the Thai Peanut + half a Soynami would be a perfect meal.   I can eat a giant steak in one sitting, but this meal made me go into couch potato food coma mood because I was just so...full...  In my return trips, I have learned not to eat the entire bowl and to pace myself, but the call of the deliciousness and the great staff keeps me coming back again and again.  I don't know if it's healthy, I don't know how they do it, but I don't care...it's delicious.  Note:  I haven't tried any of the \"fake meat\" items--that just sounds weird to me...so no feedback on that. The decor is a bit odd, but it's one of those quirky joints you just learn to appreciate as a contributor to the \"local flavor\" category. PS: They have VIMTO!  I was seriously taken aback and laughing when I first saw this, but it definitely took me back to some Middle East travels...if you love Vimto, this is your place!"}
{"text":"My favorite haunt, usually there 2-3 times per week. BBQ chicken sandwich could fool most any serious carnivore. Best thing to order is the daily special -- which unfortunately is offered less often than more. Brunch on Sunday, though not cheap, is good, especially the sticky buns. Again, get the daily special. Parking can be problematic, though you're sure to find hybrids and HRC stickers, so it won't sting as much."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! I had lunch at Green yesterday and I have nothing but good things to say. The food was excellent! Much better than I expected. The staff was very nice. The atmosphere was fun and lively. The only things that I was not thrilled about is the seating. Basically you have to run to an empty table, bus it yourself, and if the table isn't empty you have to intrude on people that are getting ready to leave. I don't mind asking people if they are done with their meal but I felt a little awkward doing it, like I was rushing them..... The other negative is the way that the staff screams your name when your food is up. I think if they implemented a number system the whole place would function more efficiently. Overall, the experience was pleasant, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Really good. I had the Big Wack and my teen had the nuggets and fries. As a non vegan she loved her meal more than the other meals that she has had while we have been in Phoenix. Hope to make it back."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, there is hardly any meat I won't eat.   Ok, liver sucks.   Anyway, just because I love meat doesn't mean I am not evolved enough to eat at a vegetarian restaurant. I'd heard great things about Green & went there with my vegetarian friend.  The food was great. I even loved the mock chicken. Do I know what the mock chicken is made of? No, and I don't care. It was good.  They have these shakes that are made without milk which is awesome, because I'm allergic to cow's milk. It was huge, delicious, & there was no way I could finish it.   Am I going to turn vegetarian after eating there? Not a chance, but I will for sure go back & eat some more fake meat.   Told you I loved meat...even fake meat. ;O"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan of 4+ years and have on a number of occasions dined here and Nami. For the most part the food has been good, but I consider it comfort food because of its heavy sauces and rich flavors. Don't get me wrong it's quite good and flavorful. But unfortunately it's been going down hill the last few years because of its smaller portions, higher prices (which don't trouble too much), but my biggest concern is the cleanliness of the place. I was just here yesterday with my good bud Jeff and man the place is in need of some MAJOR cleaning from floors needing to be machine scrubbed, air vents in the ceiling needing major cleaning, chairs are filthy, and restrooms need love. Look, I'm not bashing just sharing the concern, because let's face it, if you don't take pride in where your customers dine, sit and enjoy their food, what does the kitchen look like, eek!  I know vegan options in Phoenix are scarce, and I've been to most of them, and I don't want to criticize a place with a decent reputation, but I can't keep coming back to enjoy a good vegan meal in a dirty place. Get it cleaned up and you'll earn back my biz!  With love and respect!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty interesting. Its a little hard to find if you've never been there before, its in a little strip mall nudged right into the corner by a print shop and a skate shop if I remember right. The decor is actually pretty cool and trippy. One wall is all yellow with a gigantic paragraph/quote of text on black that takes up that whole section and there are some cool paintings decorating it. It has this kitschy meets hippie vibe. Countr people were nice. I had mock chicken with noodles and you get served in the slanted ceramic bowls they have at mongolian BBQs like Genghis Grill. I had the mock chicken and noodles and if I didnt know better, Id swear it was pretty close to the real thing, the portions were pretty huge I didnt finish mine, but it was pretty cool to check out at least once, though I had kind of wished Id ordered the vegan chili fries when all was said and done."}
{"text":"I truly love Green. I'm not a vegetarian, but Green is a fine example of how good vegetarian food can be. In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that some vegetarian food is much better than non-vegetarian food.  The GF is a veggie tale and she loves it here. My personal favorite is a Wendy's Pickle. Here recently they have been adding new stuff such as tacos and tSoynamis - both which are good (the tSoynami is excellent, tacos are decent)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is now one of my top favourite vegan restaurants! I came in with my non-vegan Dad to show him some of the wonderful things that I can still eat as a vegan and it was a success! I ordered the spicy po boy, my dad got the big wac burger and a side of thyme fried to share. We both tried a bit of each others food and everything was amazing! To finish off, we decided to share a vegan soft serve (I chose the doughboy). I've never tried vegan soft serve before but I think I have found my new favourite thing haha! Definitely recommend visiting Green New American Vegetarian!"}
{"text":"The most perfect beautiful butterfly of a restaurant I can ever imagine. I was really sad to go home back to Michigan mostly because I had to leave Green behind. It's been two days and I still haven't stopped thinking about their crab puffs. I also got the Mongolian bowl with the chicken and it's was the best chicken substitute I've ever had. I'm going to try to frequent Phoenix more, mostly because of Green"}
{"text":"I just realized that Phoenix has tons of vegan and vegetarian restaurants. That's awesome, we need to bring this culinary alternative to the dirty south! This place is pretty popular, I believe I waited 10 minutes in line to place my order. I decided to keep it simple and order the dagobah jungle salad. I'm not a fan of processed soy based food, which made it difficult to explore the menu like I really wanted to. The wait for my salad was even longer, there were no clean tables and it was clear that they were understaffed.   Finally my food arrives, and after taking the first... I was genuinely impressed. The dressing was delicious and I love the jerk inspired fried Brussel Sprouts! I would recommend this place for anyone that wants to try something new, but I'll be sure to either arrive right when they open or call in your order for pickup."}
{"text":"The Big Wac was amazing if you love Big Macs! They did a great job on replicating it. Good service and good atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great food and environment just not enough non-soy options. Hard not to find something you would like! Cool employees and a dope ice machine!!!"}
{"text":"I could never go Vegan. I just can't. It's not in my blood chemistry to be able to go very long without animal protein. With that said, I really enjoy Green. I don't ever think I'm getting \"healthy food\" when coming here it's definitely \"junk food\" as Ben H. said, but throughout the years, it's been a safe haven for me to go to with my crazy vegan friends. There just aren't that many good places for vegans in Phoenix-- especially for good old fashioned American food. Sure you can get vegan options at Indian, Ethiopian, and Asian places...but sometimes you just want that chicken parm sammy or that big burger that your diet or lifestyle choices must keep you from. Enter Green. Fast, relatively cheap, greasy comfort food. A little something for everyone and some of the finest faux-meats I have ever had. I really love the chicken cutlets and the steak sandwich is my absolute favorite. This is not for the weak of heart-- these creations are masterful and oily, but they sure do fill you up. Save some room though, you can't leave here without getting a Soynami--basically a McFlurry type thing made with soft serve coconut milk. It's amazing. Most of the food is around 3 stars,but I bumped it up to 4 because they're ahead of the vegan game for Tempe/Phx and gosh....that Soynami!"}
{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review in my life, but this place was so good that I felt compelled to do it. I was in town for 4 days on business, and stopped in 2 separate times for dinner. Such a cute peaceful outside patio and the best vegan \"meat\" I've ever had in my life, great drinks, super friendly service. I'm not kidding when I say I will be flying back to Phoenix specifically for this food."}
{"text":"Note: this is a Vegan restaurant  I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, I am an omnivore who will ponder the proper way to prepare any animal. However this place has a Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich that still has me wondering how that is not BBQ Chicken. Awesome Beer menu. Oh and I am not usual a beer type of guy. They have all sorts of NON main stream drink choices like Dr. Better. NO Coke or Pepsi products. ALWAYS packed. Staff is sweet and really down to earth. You will find yourself coming back more and more. I certainly have."}
{"text":"Absolute greatness!!!  Service: friendly  Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this) Kung pao noodles Vegan chilli fries  Ambiance - A+  Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies.   Go next door to nami for dessert!!"}
{"text":"I was out and about, and wanted something a bit healthier.  Don't know that Green's food is necesarilly healthier, but it sure is tasty.   You could bring just about any carnivore here and I think they'd walk away happy.  I know I did  Was pretty disappointed with the Samosas though (pic).  Pretty, and they tasted fine, but I thought skimpy at $4.50  The place definitely has a bit of a California vibe, with a good eclectic mix of music.  Lunch is definitely busy, but the food comes out fast and staff make sure you're taken care of."}
{"text":"4 stars because there are so many delicious mouth watering dinner \"special\" that I am teased with and the current menu is different than old menu.   I spent almost 30 minutes trying to find something.   Well I did, it was a chicken mock with BBQ, caramelized peppers and onions, I added avocado and it was on a soft roll.   I added side of grilled Brussels sprouts, they were crisp still, a little over seasoned.  They would have been better softer, less seasoning.. I enjoyed house made lime drink, and then soft served nice cream.   Overall, place was well worth my stop, prices are fair.   Its also a very busy place.   Every few minutes 2-3 more cars pull up and I see the parking lot full with I think all of your customers.   Line to order was not a long wait, 2-3 mins each time i went up to counter.   Bring back some of those specials :)"}
{"text":"Came here with some vegetarian friends that suggested it and had great experiences in the past. We were excited to check it out.  I had the picnic salad and samosas. Hubby had the po boy, girls had the nuggs. All was very good. The Tamarind sauce with the samosas was a little sweet so I stress them without it. Great flavor.  We were able to get a seat easily (Sunday afternoon), but when I pulled into the parking lot and got the last spot, I have to admit I was scared for a second. Especially because we were a party of 8. The bathroom was pretty cool.  Ooh..and the buffalo wings....bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan by lifestyle but I have allergies to dairy and chicken eggs so I eat quite a bit of vegan foods. Plus eating vegan dishes helps me eat more veggies which is always beneficial.  I just moved to Phoenix from the Bay Area 2 months ago, and I've eaten at Green 4 times already. The food is really tasty at Green, and they are very creative with the use of vegan cheese, mock meats, and desserts. Oh my their desserts are awesome! In fact, I went there once with a friend and she could not believe how good the Orangesicle soynami dessert was. She couldn't tell that there was no dairy in it which is an excellent sign.  The customer service is excellent and they are friendly, and very nice to explain dishes if you don't understand anything. I was curious what the mock meats were actually made of, and learned something new.  You can take non-vegans to Green and they will have plenty of things to eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian or vegan myself, but I can definitely appreciate what a restaurant like Green can dish up to entice even the staunchest meat lover. In reality, everything on the menu looked amazing - fresh ingredients, inventive dishes, and always healthy. I decided to order the \"Moo-shroom BBQ Po-Boy\" sandwich, which consisted of sliced portobello slathered in sweet and tasty barbeque sauce. It came with a side of house cole slaw made with a hint of peanut butter to enhance the flavor. Both were VERY good.  Green doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is an entirely different story. All of the walls are covered with really cool recycled art i.e. old, painted VW hubcaps, menus cut up and made to look like birds flying through plastic grocery bag clouds, etc. You really just have to see it. The bottom line is, you get a strong vibe of responsibility for what you put into your body as well as the greater environment.   I'm looking forward to visiting Green again the next time I'm in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"My observations of Green:  1. The name Green belies the fact that the food is mostly comfort food. It's good, but should not be confused as health food. The last menu change seems to have put more emphasis on the comfort-food. I miss the green burger greatly. If I'm not mistaken, it was a hand-packed patty made from oats, beets and sundry seasonings. It was delicious and didn't make me feel like a pig for eating it. The newer burgers - while good comfort food - are not something I care to eat when I'm not depressed or too tired to cook.  2. The management seems to hire employees based on their number of facial piercings and overall devil-may-care fashion sense rather than friendliness, helpfulness and other attributes of a true customer-service professional. There are some very nice employees, but the lazy ones who behave as though they're doing you a favor by showing up to work have put a damper on many experiences for people I know."}
{"text":"The food is really good, I love the chicken sandwich it's my favorite every time. If you aren't vegan or vegetarian I strongly recommend give this place an opportunity, you will like it I guarantee."}
{"text":"Nice little place to get some vegan nosh. The food was good; nothing special but if I was in the area I'd have no problem coming back. Best part was the decent selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"This place was aaaallright. The menu was very interesting and I see how it sets itself apart by being a vegan restaurant. I got their house salad, but it was toooo overdressed and the spice in it was overbearing. I just ate it to eat it. But I will say their sundaes are good and great portion sizing for $5. It had an interesting flavor but I would definitely come back just for that."}
{"text":"Green is incredible! The service is fast and friendly, and the food is great! I went and ordered the \"wings\", and they were delicious. It's so hard to find vegetarian wings in general, so I was very surprised to see them on the menu! I don't eat meat, but I went with someone who does, and even she enjoyed the food! I would highly recommend this place to any vegetarian, vegan, or even to meat eaters who want to adventure out and try new things. :^)"}
{"text":"It's delicious. It's vegan and vegetarian. It's comfort food done right. Come here or go to the one in Tempe. While I like the quality of the food equally in both, I prefer the restaurant in Phoenix. But, the parking is a dream in Tempe compared to the lack of spaces in Phoenix.   I truly believe someone made a pact with the devil to come up with the Big Wac. As a vegetarian, I do not miss McDonald's, but this burger tastes better to me than I remember the Big Mac or any McDonald's burger tasting. It does this while magically capturing what is best about McDonald's burgers' dressings. The thyme fries are a prefect accompaniment.  My wife adores the O.G. Po' Boy. She says it is the best spicy, tangy buffalo \"chicken\" sandwich she has ever eaten. It's dressed with baby greens and we fight over the thyme fries everything comes with. They're worth fighting over.   It is worth a hassle, any wait, or even ordering it to go through their fantastic app."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with a unique vegan menu.  I had a BBQ burger and thyme fries. The burger patty was on the small side. Luckily there was tempeh bacon and portobello mushrooms and cartelized onions to give the sand which some bulk.  It was tasty but not quite filling.   didn't see an option for vegan cheese.  Then again I didn't ask. That is my fault. Got a generous helping of the thyme fries but never really tasted the thyme.   Husband had the Big Kahuna burger special. It was more impressive in flavor and in bulk. He didn't taste the thyme either.  They have s great selection of teas and beverages to choose from.  That is a big plus for us.  Overall not bad.  Staff are very friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I haven't anything here that didn't upset my carnivorous stomach... which makes me sad cause I love to explore all kinds of food. That's the ONLY reason the rating is so low. I loved the Po boy they have and enjoyed their drink station and vibe. I like that local artist are welcome to sell and post their work and it all fits. I tried the steak and mushroom sandwich and hated it... forcing it down with a really good iced coffee. Can't really mod the coffee at all but it was good and I hope I will find something that I love."}
{"text":"Wow this place is AMAZING!  I AM NOT A VEGETARIAN or vegan, by any stretch of the imagination, and was dragged here by some vegetarian friends who swore this place was amazing, and I left completely converted, at least to Green.  What I love about this place is that it's VEGETARIAN COMFORT FOOD. The flavor profiles are so delicious, the replacement for meats tastes so good (no weird textures or weird after tastes), and you don't feel like you have to be super healthy (although you can choose healthier options if you want).   The spicy buffalo wings, the chili fries, the big wac burger, and the samosas were DELICIOUS. The atmosphere is very casual and minimal, and the prices are great. I am so impressed!"}
{"text":"Very vegan. The menu includes a variety of choices. Under the sandwiches and burger section everything is 'mock'. I like the Big Wac it's the same as a Big Mac but it's bigger and more filling. The fries are way better than mcdonalds.   Plus they have Jones soda. I love this place. Don't be surprised to see some artzy fartzy people though"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so nice and so edgy! My friend and I really enjoyed it! I got the drunken Mongolian with mock beef and fried noodles! Hole in the wall!!!"}
{"text":"Blew my mind...  So!  I been a meat eater for so long and used to be very close minded about trying vegetarian dishes...... ....this spot changed my lifestyle.  Flavor is so good. Variety for dishes is huge!  They have daily/weekly menu specials which are off menu special dishes.   They sell local beer and natural fresh drinks, which they are addictive.  Location it is great, very close from my work and home, with great parking.   This spot sometimes gets sooooo packed, so be ready for the occasional long lines.  Price is decent, wouldn't mind few bucks cheaper :p  Definitely a must go spot in the valley! You wont regret it."}
{"text":"Had the Big Wac!!  Swear it tasted just like a Big Mac but even better.  The service is great the music is eclectic and they have a nice little kids menu.   Hope this place stays open forever I wish I could bring one back to Wisconsin with me."}
{"text":"My husband, mom and I came here after hearing from a vegan friend how wonderful it is and seeing the great reviews on Yelp.    We decided to order a variety of appetizers and planned on ordering our main entrees after the appetizers.  However we were so disappointed at the quality of the appetizers that we decided we had tried enough and left.  We had the samosas, buffalo wings, tofu satay with peanut sauce, and eggless rolls. The buffalo wings bordered on disgusting.  I was so disappointed because that is my favorite item to order when eating at Veggie Grill ( CA locations) or Native Café (locations in CA and other states). Green -  you need to take a lesson from either one of those two restaurants on how to make amazing buffalo wings!!! The remaining appetizers were just okay, not great.   About an hour after we ate, all three of us were having tummy issues and making emergency trips to the bathroom.   I really wanted to love this place as it is hard to find Vegan restaurants!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and Green just keeps getting better. The Big Wac burger is hands down my new favorite and the fried Brussels sprouts are cooked to perfection. Get the strawberry lemonade if you know what's good for you. And maybe a PB 'n Chocolate tsoynami."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I've been back to Green a couple times now.  To be honest, I'm still a little suspicious of the mock meat items but I'll be the first to tell you the mock chicken buffalo wings taste oh so good.  Tastes like chicken!! haha.  They have this amazing tea too (the amber looking one), can't go wrong with the thai peanut bowl."}
{"text":"We took our vegan guests to dinner. My first vegan experience. I saw chili cheese fries... cheese steak... and other indulgences I stay away from because my tummy hates them. Well, I can tell you we ordered several items and everything was tasteful. The best part is that I didn't get an upset stomach! I'm definitely making another trip. Impressed!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot with delicious vegetarian food! Yum. And local beer, friendly service, charming decor... Go get some."}
{"text":"This place has amazing vegan food!! Me and my husband both loved it, we will both definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"i don't know why i do this to myself...i'm not a veggie, i go to a veggie joint and i order mock beef or mock chicken..it always makes me feel gross..the cycle continues...on the up side, service was great, and decor was on point. next time i'll try the salad.  I will say this, the artichoke gratin was bomb! i would come back to avoid anything mock, not because its not good, it just doesn't sit well with me."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but my friend is. So we had to try it! By the time we sat down there was a line out the door.... I can see why as out meals were delicious....  absolutely fabulous meals! very flavorful and I will definitely be back. I would recommend it to anyone really. It sold me!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not a vegan but I love the food they serve here. My co worker took me for lunch and I'm hooked. I had the samosas, eggless egg rolls, raspberry beret, and strawberry lemonade. It was all so flavorful and cooked just right. I was full and satisfied.   The service was surprisingly fast considering it was lunch time. To be honest I was hoping I didn't have to wait because I'm 7 months pregnant and I can get hangry at times. Luckily it ended well for everyone.   I will be back and I'm taking my mom next time."}
{"text":"Dinning with vegans and vegs again.  Not much to choose from as I try not to eat soy.  No reason to hold that against them.  If you do eat soy this place is the bomb!  I tasted their Big Mac and I like it.  The fries are addictive."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in for a late lunch last weekend. I ordered the Sesame Dragon bowl and we also had some thyme fries and crab puffs. The Sesame Dragon bowl was decent but could have used more sauce or flavor (though I tend to like my stir-fry with more sauce than most). The \"thyme fries\" were OK but I didn't taste any thyme. However, the crab puffs were awesome. I don't know what kind of vegan magic goes into making them, but I highly recommend getting them! I also had green tea to drink, and it was nice that the four different teas & lemonades were all self-serve & free-refills.  I've been trying to eat vegetarian more often throughout the week and Green has been on my list of places I've wanted to try for a while. I finally was able to drag someone with me and was also pleasantly surprised that this is a casual \"order at the counter and food is brought out to you\" kind of place rather than one with waiters -- good to know for future times I may be looking for a quick bite.  The main downside was that the dining area was not very clean at the time we visited. The open tables were pretty dirty as were the floors. I also didn't notice any staff wiping off tables during the time we were there. It may have just been a freak thing and I still plan on visiting again, but this is something I'll be paying attention to."}
{"text":"I first need to state that I am not a Vegan, but rather a meat eater of the highest order. However, I have a friend who is vegan, and this is their favorite restaurant. If I could eat from this menu 3x a day, I would be vegan too. the Chicken Wings were an amazing appetizer, and both of the sandwiches we ordered were flat out great...vegan or not. This is a great restaurant and I know we will be back frequently."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!  Im a new vegetarian and am sooo excited to have found this place.  The buffalo chicken wings are exceptional."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I love Green! It's awesome to have a menu full of nothing but vegan dishes in a somewhat veg-unfriendly city like Phoenix.  My carnivore husband loves it too and talks it up to people just as glowingly as I do.  They always have great specials. Just recently they had a great turkey pesto sandwhich which sounds kind of ordinary, but it was way better than anything I can make at home. Their taco special with mock shredded beef was killer. They even have a Big Wac if you miss that nasty burger from McDonald's.  My favorite dishes are the No Harm Chicken Parm and Meatball sandwich. Their marinara is so flavorful! Lots of garlic, just how I like it. When I lived 10 minutes away and got take out, I could barely keep myself from eating while I was driving because it smelled sooooo good.  When I'm aiming for something healthier, I get their stir-frys with extra fresh tofu, no rice. Apricot miso is my favorite of the bunch. Salads are great too, but then I usually feel compelled to order a delicious tsoynami to undo their health benefits."}
{"text":"I like to hit up the Phoenix location of Green when I'm in the area usually because I see some yummy special on Instagram that lures me in. Most recently, it was a vegan version of an Arby's Beef and Cheddar.  I really appreciate that you can order the sandwiches by themselves now because they are plenty filling on their own. The sides are very good though. My husband loves the fries, and I go for the tahini coleslaw.  One thing I wish could be tweaked is the size of the sandwich buns. It's a little too much bread  to filling ratio for me. I could be healthy and order some of the rice and veggie bowls, but I'm not going to drive all that way for such nonsense. I'm here for the vegan junk food!  Green has long been a favorite of mine. I'd go here over Coronado any day."}
{"text":"Modern bohemian atmosphere with hearty vegan menu that wont leave you empty. The spicy is not too spicy and the sauces are just right. Great place for good food."}
{"text":"I LOVE Green. I am not a Vegan or even a Vegetarian, but I do appreciate great food.  My first time here was great because I went with a group and got to try bites of a variety of items. The hummus is my fave. It's got  a bit of a spice which I love and comes with deep fried pita (sometimes a bit too greasy, but I can deal). The artichoke appetizer is delish, but not anything like a traditional, so I wouldn't expect that. The salads are really yummy, I can't remember which ones I've tried, so I can't specify which are best. And today, I tasted heaven in the form of a tater tot. They just introduced sweet potato puffs and they are incredible. I will be getting these as a side every time now! And then there's the tsoynami. Most incredible frozen treat ever. I get the betterfinger with no choco chips, add peanut butter and double chicostix (sp?) SOOOOOO good words can't describe.  I love it here so much that I make the trek from Ahwatukee to Scottsdale for lunch, salivating in anticipation, just to please my pallet a few times per month and it is worth every mile.   As mentioned in just about every review, the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to make a recommendation if you ask. One time, when there was a mishap with my office's order that caused me to wait an extended period of time for pick up, I got a call upon returning to work from the manager with a personal apology. I can't recall another place EVER taking the time to do that. For this, I am forever loyal.  Reviewing this made me crave it all over again. I may have to go back for dinner. Don't judge me."}
{"text":"I asked my Mom to take me somewhere really healthy, while I was visiting her in Phoenix a few weeks ago. She decided to take me to Green. I knew I would like it upon first walking in, and indeed it was very good! They had a lot of fake meat products on the menu, but I decided to go with the Mongolian Tofu. It had great flavor, and it was very filling. I also drank the Sweet Lime, which was very refreshing, especially in 106 degree heat. Everyone we were with enjoyed their food, except my boyfriend, who wasn't too into their version of fake mozzarella cheese...was kind of rubbery, but um, what do you expect? Real cheese is where it's at, hence the reason I could never be a vegan. The inside of this place is also cute -- my kind of place! I wish there was something similar to this in SF, because I would go a lot!"}
{"text":"Food was great. My wife is Vegan (I'm not) we decided to give this place a shot. I'm very satisfied with my experience.  The people that work here are very nice and I could hear the cooks singing which made me laugh. I also like that they seemed very quick to clean the vacant tables (nothing is grosser than a dirty table, well maybe two dirty tables). One thing I will say is that the music was a bit to loud for me but I'm sure they would have turned it down if I asked."}
{"text":"I have been to Green many times and didn't write a review, but they have been helpful for me so I wanted to make sure to help others.  First of all, this restaurant is 100 percent vegan (although it's called Green Vegetarian).  I don't go to green when I want to have a salad or cold sandwich because I can make that at home.  This place serves delicious comfort food.  By comfort, I don't mean greasy or fattening, but don't go here if you're calorie conscious.  This is a great place to take friends and family who are not vegan or vegetarian because the food tastes so \"normal.\"  Green has the best mock chicken and mock beef I have ever had anywhere in the country (so far).  All of the sandwiches/burgers are to die for.  The thyme fries are great but if you want to keep it on the healthier side, go for the tahini coleslaw as a side option--it may be my favorite dish at Green.  Before I was vegan--more than five years ago--I didn't care for chicken wings but after years of watching other people scarf tens at a time, I grew a desire for them.  I have ordered them in bulk and meat lovers cannot taste the difference.  They are delicious and served with cucumber ranch and veggies.  I think I misspoke when I said the tahini slaw was my fave because I think this one might be it.  I've had the samosas and couldn't tell you anything good (or bad) about them.  They just left me with no impression.  The bowls are good but simple.  I feel like I can get similar dishes at other places so I would rather have something more exciting.  But if you're in the mood for something like that with the delicious mock meats, go for one of these.   I usually go to Green for its specials, which are posted on Facebook. They've been some of my favorite dishes and are usually delicious!   I have yet to try a dessert because I'm always full when I leave but make sure to try one of the tsoynamis.  They are light and a perfect end to a great meal.  I always get the almond oy vey and substitute the chocolate with bananas. Nom.  This is the best vegan or vegetarian restaurant in the greater Phoenix are.  I would highly recommend going there whether you are vegetarian/vegan or not.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"we always wanted to go here and finally had the money to do so. we loved the chocolate almond milk that was to die for!!! he had homemade lemonade which was very good too. the problem we have with this place is they put agave nectar, soymilk, and tofu in pretty much everything and we can't stand that! it's hard to pick something to eat when it has all of that.  we had sammies (forgot what they are called) with thyme fries omg sooo delicious! the staff was awesome and friendly so cool! they got a fridge of vegan cheese, organic drinks, etc. another issue we have is why does this place have coke products? why be into the organic foods yet ur gonna drink more chemicals yet they carry virgil's root beer which is organic?!"}
{"text":"Fkn delish!  This place never disappoints!  I've been here twice so far (two different visits to PHX) and always have to come here.  Their Big Wac is outta this world!  The fake fish sandwich is solid!  Were my family willing to live in an oven, we'd relocate to Arizona and eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Wow it was such a great restaurant we took some non vegetarians and they loved it as well. Try the buffalo wings you will think its chicken. I had the chicken pram. Sandwich and it was crunchy and so good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a vegetarian's fondest dream - and I am no exception.  The service is friendly and personable, and best of all, quick!  This is my favorite place to meet up with my girlfriends and spend a couple of hours chatting.  The hummus is good, if a smidge spicy. The tofu is fantastic.    Go there.  Eat some good food.  You won't miss meat at all."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant when I want a healthy, vegan meal with REAL flavor. Everything from the Big WAC to the Mongolian Bowl has been delicious. And since it is all pretty healthy, I can head next door to get a tsoynami afterwards. Totally guilt free, delicious food."}
{"text":"first off, let me state for the record: I am NOT one of those hippy, vegan, alt eaters.  i neeed my meat.  i LOVE gluten.   (true story: i have a bunch of moderate to serious health problems. the day they told me i showed signs of celiac and should probly cut back on the gluten, i cried like a baby! i took it waaaayy worse than any of the other illnesses. but i digress)  Having said that, GREEN is an amazing place to eat for anyone.  seriously, take your meat eater friends.  blindfold them and tell them they're going to a steak house and order for them... well maybe not that far,  but you get the idea.  i was really skeptical, but it was really good. it's a good transition into alt eating."}
{"text":"After living near Austin and sampling the city's wide array of vegan spots, perhaps my expectations are too high - but everything I have tried at Green has just been \"meh.\"  This is vegan junk food, but it isn't remarkable.  The predominant flavors are salt and oil.   Much of the stuff reminds of foods I would make at home with prepackaged ingredients (especially when tipsy), and it's not the quality you would expect from a highly rated restaurant.   I enjoy pigging out on salty fats as much as the next person (just check out my blood pressure), but I expect more interesting flavors, textures, menu offerings from a vegan restaurant.  And...no beer to wash down the grease?  No!!  However, if you want to have a good vegan 'greasy spoon' moment, there's slim pickings around here.  So I have been here several times, and have concluded that the best things on the menus are the fries, buffalo chicken, and salads.  STARTERS  Chili Fries - Mushy, greasy, soggy.  The sauce tasted sweet and somewhat ketchupy, with rubbery soy crumbles.  So salty my mouth burned.  I still finished the plate, though.  Crab puffs - Again, a bit greasy, but that's to be expected.  You can't really *not* enjoy the taste of salt and grease.  Samosas - Dry/crumbly inside and not as flavorful as I had hoped for.  Nothing that could compete with an Indian restaurant's offerings.  Hummus - I found the hummus bland and the pita dippers almost institutional.  One item on the menu that isn't soaked in grease, and it's flavorless - really illustrates how much Green relies on salt/fat to season.  Eggless rolls - Nothing special.  You could get these anywhere.  ENTREES  Ranchero salad - I enjoyed the vegan ranch dressing and the combo of chicken texture with the salad greens.  The buffalo wings had a good meatiness and an excellent sweetish vinegary sauce.  Not a healthy salad at all, but tasty.  Meatball po-boy - I ate the whole thing, but it isn't remarkable.  Plain white sub bread (perhaps a bit stale), standard tomato sauce, and what seemed like premade (not house-made) soy meatballs.  Similar to a bag of Veggie Patch or Nathans.  A generous smear of vegan cheese.  Mexicali Burger - Ew.  I couldn't finish this.  The patty was bland, mushy, wet, and had the consistency of pre-chewed bread bits.  No thanks.  Perhaps if they cooked it longer and crisped the outside, it would be better.  The \"nacho cheese\" sauce was just as offensive.  Green Burger - I tried a bite of my dining companion's.  Soggy again, and she did not finish hers either.  Please, Green - change the burger recipe and preparation.  A vegan joint *needs* to have the veggie burger mastered!  SIDES  Tahini Coleslaw - You wouldn't expect something with tahini to be so bland, but this stuff is.  I am generally a coleslaw fan, but this stuff is just not restaurant-quality.  Pasta salad - Bland.  Sigh...  Shoestring thyme fries - Crispy, thin, delicious."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian nor a vegan, so I was unsure about going here. Their food was amazing!  After a friend raved about them, I thought I'd try it because I have a dairy and egg allergy, so I can't have alot of foods anymore. I had the creamy artichoke dip and the \"beef\" drunken mushroom bowl with lots of yummy veggies and pan fried noodles. The \"beef\" really tasted like the real thing! I wanted to try one of their desserts but I was full. Hmmm.... guess I need to make another trip  :-D"}
{"text":"\"Sorry I'm taking so long to choose, it's just that I've never been able to eat EVERYTHING on the menu before!\"  Quote from my wife as she looks over the menu at Green.  It's wonderfully refreshing to hear her say that (and feel that way myself) but that's the case at Green.    Burgers?  Sandwiches? Bowls?  All vegetarian/vegan?  Yes!    I had the \"Big Wac\" she the \"Coconut Curry\", both were very tasty and really hit the spot.  And the thyme fries?  Yeah, totally awesome.  We live 3+ hours away but will be trying to stop in every time we venture down to Phoenix it's just that good."}
{"text":"We didn't feel like driving all the way down to Phoenix so we decided to come to the Scottsdale location we walked in and there was a line all the way out of the door. They is plenty of seating inside - both tables and huge booths as well as patio seating. Today we ordered the cheese puffs, Chicago cheesesteak, and the chili . To finish off our meal we got the Rocky road soynami with no chocolate chips.  The food was delicious as usual, however I remember the cheesesteak sandwich being cheesier and overflowing at the Phoenix location. When we got our soynami, they completely got our order wrong. They gave us a vanilla with extra chocolate chips :/. The silverware was also dirty and and we had to wait 10 minutes to get napkins and clean Silverware. There were also two other groups who had their orders messed up and were told the wait was going to be 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Green is the sort of place I wish existed in Berkeley, CA. It doesn't make sense that Tempe has it so good. It doesn't make sense that there isn't a place filled with vegan comfort food in CA. But enough of my boo-hooing.  We stopped by for lunch and when we were done, I wished I was wearing my pants with the elastic waistband. The fries have that bumpy, crispy coating. (Bumpy + crispy = delicious.) The various sandwiches that I ingested were flavorful and filling (as 2 sandwiches often are).  The mock chicken parmesan was all I could have asked for: crispy and saucy, not too tough, and delightfully messy to eat. The Soynami was over the top heavenly: chocolate and peanut butter having a meeting in a cup and I was the chairman of the board.  It makes visiting Arizona fun! Well, it already is fun*, but you get my point.  ______________________ *really hot"}
{"text":"Green is a great place to visit every once in a while. As a regular meat eater I was surprised how filling and tasty a vegan restaurant could be.  Not once through the entire meal was I longing for a healthy chunk of meat.  For desert I got a soynami, not sure how to spell it. That was also delightful. If you're in the area stop by and enjoy a hearty yet healthy meal. Or if you just want to for dessert or snack stop by green"}
{"text":"Perfect antidote to the horrible ballpark food during Spring Training. The food was delicious and unpretentious,  while the portion size was just right. Someone made a comment about the fake chicken and it was very tasty.  I can see why this place was packed. There was a line out the door while we were there but it moved quickly."}
{"text":"Where do I start, how about with desert?!  You can not go to Green and not get a tsoynami!  They offer many different flavors so why not just try them all, you won't be let down.  From fruit to chocolate and peanut butter, just pick one!  The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come true!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!  If you want something a little healthier I recommend one of the bowls or a salad of course.  Either way in my opinion you won't go wrong with whatever you try.  Vegetarian food has come a long way and I couldn't be happier to have so many options!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan Dinner & appetizers. Good crab puffs! did not care for the spiced edamame - where's the spice? I liked my peanut thai noodles with good veggies. My friend wasn't impressed with the caliexica burger. Liked the fountain drinks!"}
{"text":"This place needs to come to Vegas! Only regret was eating there once. We ordered almost one of everything that was on the menu. Everything was pretty good. It's pricey & you have to order fries on the side with your burgers."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! I  wanted to enjoy a meal with my boyfriend and friend. I had brought food pre packaged from Flower child due to the fact that I have dietary restrictions that make it difficult for me to eat anywhere. Rather than eat inside and be disrespectful to the establishment I sat outside. I  was told that I can't eat my food there sure to health regulations OUTSIDE!  Not to mention there are dogs sitting outside!! whah!!  (i love dogs and really don't care) but just seems unfair to accommodate for patrons  so sad. :("}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Staff was equally as great!  Didn't catch the girls name that had helped me, she had red hair, but she helpful and very sweet.  Two thumbs up!  I'll be back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I live in Tucson. Sorry to say it, but the one vegan restaurant here in town (Lovin' Spoonfuls), as hard as they try, doesn't hit the mark like Green does. I've been patiently waiting to incorporate a visit to Green into my usually busy and brief stays in Phoenix. Today was the day and I was not let down. Started off with the buffalo wings and artichoke gratin. The wings and ranch dip were fantastic. The wing sauce itself was a true standout and the ranch was as about as authentic as a vegan version could be. The artichoke dip was ok but not stellar. It was a bit soupy and probably would make a better sauce than anything else. For the main, I had to go with the Big WAC. It was at this point that I found myself in vegan nirvana. My high hopes for this plant based version of the American fav were exceeded. It tasted somewhere between the Big Mac and In n Out Double Double that I enjoyed so much in my omni days. A carnivore could easily be deceived by the tastes and textures of this burger. Towards my last couple of bites I felt a strange sadness knowing that I would have to drive 100 miles to have this treat again. The fries were good but there was no trace of thyme on them which for a thyme lover, is kind of a let down. All in all, I suspected that I was going to love Green. And my suspicion was correct. I can see myself frequenting Phoenix much more often because of this gem of an eatery. And contrary to previous reviews, I did not witness a cooler than thou, hipster attitude from the staff. The girl at the counter was very friendly and patient and several employees came by the table to check up on us. Keeping my fingers crossed for a Tucson location down the road."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the vegan food here and thought it was well priced."}
{"text":"First, I'm not a vegetarian.  I wish I were vegan, because I think it's an ethical way of eating.  Unfortunately, my love of burgers, ribs and fish makes me be less of the person I wish I were.  Oh well, that's my cross to bare.  Now, what was I doing?  Oh ya, writing a review.  The place has cool design elements --I like that.  The food was really very good!  Too good to be particularly healthy, but hey, it is a restaurant; and I don't expect restaurants to be as health conscious as home cooks.  If this place was close to where i lived I'd eat there way too often.  mmmmmm"}
{"text":"While on our way to a onsie pub crawl we came here to grab a Chicago Philly cheesesteak, crab puffs, po boy sandwich. This place is one of the yummiest in the city for vegan food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  I love the BBQ Chik'n!  I also love the cookie dough.  I felt it is a bit pricey but I am OK with it.  Parking is sometimes rough at lunchtime so I usually pick up and run.  Maybe they will figure out some way around it.  They are always great and helpful with phone orders."}
{"text":"Green is my absolute favorite restaurant ever. The thyme fries are spectacular, the tsoynamis are heavenly, the argentine po-boy is enough to convince my mother (carnivorous, formerly suspicious of vegan food) to return again and again. And don't neglect the crab puffs, the buffalo wings, even the salads. What a perfectly yummy place."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Green through a friend who had her birthday dinner catered by Green and later visited the Scottsdale Road location.  This was over 2 years ago.  Soon after, I learned that Green was opening a location just down the street from my home in Phoenix.  This is by far one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  I have yet to try everything on the menu.  The service is always friendly, the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean.  If you Like Green on Facebook, you can stay up to date with the specials that Green has to offer and at which location."}
{"text":"Vegan Buffalo Wings were rad. BBQ Sammie Was delicious. Cheesesteak was delicious. Kombucha, Coffee, Tea, & Booze all fantastic. This is Vegan Heaven.   Heavy on the Soy products, so take it easy vegans. And make sure you hit up Nami next door afterwards, it's like a unwritten rule."}
{"text":"I am a carnivore so I only go here when I find myself with an out-of-town vegetarian. my guests love their Big Mac. I have tried several things on the menu and they are all fairly edible considering the mock meat"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, but the meals and tofu here are fabulous. The tofu can change anyone's mind who previously did not enjoy it! Vegetarian or not, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was there the other day and Gabby was the most helpful caring server I have ever had! She kept checking on my order for me because it was taking a little bit longer but she made my whole experience the food is amazing but great customer service made it all:)"}
{"text":"So. Tasty. Reasonably priced, fast, vegetarian. The thyme fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"During a extended layover at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, I searched for the closest vegan hot spot. I saw that Green had many outstanding reviews. So I headed over in a cab.  After chatting with the staff, I ordered a black jack pita. Which is a blackened cajun mock chicken with artichoke hearts, lettuce, tomato and our lemon-tahini sauce in a toasted pita. And it was far better than anything I could have hoped to order at an airport. So it was well worth the trip."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, Green Restaurant serves fantastic vegan meals that I sorely wish were back in my city of Oakland. Looking at the selections of entrees and sides, it feels just like an all-American diner- but without the stinky grease! You walk into this place and it does not at all feel like a cheap place to get your fix of fries and burgers. Such a good vibe!  You walk up the counter, place your order, and then barely get to wait, as it comes out to you rather quickly. There is also a refrigerator that stocks some bottles of kombucha- you know, just to fill out your vegan dinner checklist!  This great feeling, for me, is exemplified in the Po' Boy sammie. The mock chicken was so meaty and filling that I was astounded it was meatless! The buffalo sauce was just the right combination of spice and heat. Makes my mouth water right now just recalling that delicious sandwich.  I found the prices to be a tad higher than I would expect, BUT I would whole-heartedly support a vegan restaurant instead of a traditional American joint."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian. At all. Never have been, truly cannot envision a world in which I ever will be. That being said, I adore Green.  I forgot it existed for a really long time, and fairly recently rediscovered the Scottsdale location. It's not too far from my house, and definitely on my drive home from work... So I foresee this becoming an issue. We went to take out a few dishes on a Friday night, because February-March is the time of year when my life becomes consumed by college basketball, and there was an Arizona game on that night. The line out the door was a little daunting at first, but moved pretty quickly. Pro tip: If you order and pay online, you can mosey on right past all of the peasants in line and just pick your order up at the counter.   Pro tip 2: If you order a tsoynami at the same time as the rest of your food, it gives you pretty much the perfect amount of time to scarf down the tsoynami while you're waiting for your order to come out. Our tsoynami of choice on this trip was the Fluffernutterin. Peanut buttery, banana-y, toasty marshmallowy greatness, combined with the swirlytwirly ice cream of course. It doesn't even taste soy based. It just tastes like heaven.   We decided to share the animal fries. French fries are some of my favorite things in the entire world, and cheese right alongside it, so I was pretty skeptical about vegan cheese ruining one of my favorite dishes. But realistically, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between vegan cheese and normal American cheese (because let's be honest, it's hardly even real cheese). The fries were excellent, just a tiny bit soggy from the drive home. The onions fried perfectly, and the thousand island flavorful without being too acidic. I was also hesitant about the $5.50 price tag, but you get a TON of fries. Definitely would/will get again.  I'm totally fine to have vegetarian meals here and there, but I'm not a big fake meat person; I have to imagine a big percentage of it is mental, but I feel like fake meat usually makes me feel unwell. So, I opted for the Thai Peanut Bowl, with the house tofu. Best call. Their house tofu is amazing; fried to perfection, it absorbs the sauces but doesn't get soggy and fall apart. The sauce on the bowl was really tasty, just spicier than I was anticipating it'd be (I'm kind of a baby when it comes to spice though). The brown rice was just a little bit overcooked, it seemed a bit dry. The veggies in my bowl seemed to be in kind of a weird limbo state between being raw and cooked... I think I would've preferred them to be left on the pan for just a few minutes longer. Overall, pretty tasty. Just could've used a tiny bit extra love.   Undoubtedly, I will be back. Probably this afternoon to get my tsoynami fix. I'M NOT AN ADDICT, YOU ARE."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and decided to check this place out. I'm so happy I did! The food was amazing and staff was really pleasant. The buffalo \"chicken\" wings where addicting!"}
{"text":"Woah that bbq \"chicken\" sandwich was awesome. I don't know how they do it, but that tastes like straight up chicken!  I'm also not vegan, but I enjoy vegan/vegetarian food. Can't wait to come again next time I'm in town. :)"}
{"text":"Am visiting friends who are vegen and went out to dinner...my first vegen restaurant!  the only word i can think of is outstanding!  the crab cakes are succulent, all our entrees were delish.  Their desserts are to die for!  Definitely will find time to return before going home.  TRY IT, YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Kung pos tofu, steamed vegetables  and brown rice.very tasty. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff courteous."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times now.... each time was delicious and the flavors are yummy..... I love the texture of the tofu.  Again.... the flavors are YUMMY.  While my husband and daughter love lots of sauce - I find my dishes have been heavily sauced.... but not to worry - I will just ask for the sauce on the side!    I love their teas and Iimeade!  SOOOOO Good!    Service is FANTASTIC!  And the service is super quick.  Yum!  Give this place a try and if you are like me - ask for your sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Hubby has been eating mostly vegetarian lately, so we decided to check out Green. I don't think we'll go back.   Everything we ate, we could get better elsewhere. Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good, with noodles, a zippy sauce, and big crunchy veggies. All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots. Maybe it's just me, but I like some texture and identifiable ingredients in my egg rolls. They were also weirdly spiced and arrived without the dipping sauce advertised in the menu. The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters. He didn't seem to care that we thought they were bad- he just shrugged and said, \"Well SOME people don't like them.\" Well, I guess we're SOME people then. We also tried the much praised pseudo crab puffs, and they were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce that managed to come out with this plate. Hubby also had to have the soy \"blizzard\". He liked it, and I thought the taste was fine initially, but then had an aftertaste I didn't care for.   The atmosphere is clearly meant for hipster youngsters. The lighting was so low that I literally had a hard time reading the white on black menu. Seriously, Green. Have some consideration for your clientele over 20.   The last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff. As we finished our meal, they were starting to close. Hubby went up to the counter to order his soy \"blizzard\" and the too-cool-for-the-rest-of-us young man behind the counter had to ask a co-worker if they were still making them. Um, if you still have customers in the restaurant, I would imagine you should still be making them. It's not like we were in there for a half hour past closing, and there were still many customers in the place.   One last observation: what's up with all the vegetarian and vegan smokers clogging the entrance? God forbid there be any animal products in your bodies, but bring on the tar and chemicals!?! As someone who quit smoking after many years, I would appreciate it if Green would insist that their customers observe the keep-it-20-feet-from-the-entrance ordinance."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time this past week, and I thought it was interesting. It is a good place to go to if you are vegan.   You order up at the front and then they bring your food to your table. I tried the tacos and they were good. Nothing special, I was trying to figure out what they put in it because it tasted interesting. I also tried the ice cream and it was interesting too. I got the cookie dough type one and it is basically soft serve ice cream with cookie dough bits inside. It isn't creamy.   I liked trying this place though. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  Very friendly people making and serving great dishes.  Many larger restaurants with so-called vegetarian/vegan menu sections could learn a lot from this place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I love it that much that it was actually one of my deciding factors in signing my new apartment lease lol. Now I'm like 5 mins away so I'll definitely be coming back.  Update* I used to love this place but ever since they changed their menu i feel the quality has gone down. They have limited their salad options and sadly it's just not the same anymore."}
{"text":"Prices are okay. Quality of food is great! Vibe is very Portland Hipster."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant while I was visiting Arizona and I was impressed. This is some delicious vegan food. It is as good (and better than some) as the vegan food here in LA and much cheaper. I started with the crab puffs which were basically the vegan version of crab rangoon. I used to love crab rangoon before I became vegetarian 15+ years ago and haven't had it since, so this was a treat. I honestly couldn't tell it was vegan. The cream cheese and fake crab was perfect. I also got the big WAC which is their vegan version of a big mac. This was one of the best veggie burgers I've had. It tasted just like what I have always imagined a big mac tastes like (I've never actually eaten one). It was also a huge burger and under $10. I will definitely be back next time I am in Phoenix. Plus there is a vegan bakery next store"}
{"text":"I think I need to not tell so many people about this place, because it keeps getting busier every time I go.   My go-to meal and favorite recommendation for people: Their buffalo wings.  Yes, it does not have chicken in it, but damn...whatever it is, it tastes awesome.  It even has a lil' bite to it, as it is diced green peppers.   My Green addiction: Tsoynamis!  If I can't make it to Green on a whim, I attempt to make one of their Tsoynami creations at home...but it never tastes the same.  The serving size is big, at least for me, so it can be a meal in itself.   Big props to Green.  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I love the Tempe/Scottsdale location but I have to say I enjoy this one much more. Feels a little less pretentious, a little more grown-up, and hopping next door to Nami for a Tsoynami and vegan dessert is unbeatable.  I love everything on the menu and have always been impressed by the prices. Whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not, GO. I have brought several friends who are meat eaters and have since been back with them on countless occasions. The options are overwhelming. Their mock meat is incredible and all of their noodle dishes are loaded with an abundant variety of fresh vegetables. Great for a healthy lunch or dinner with friends.  Even if you're not big on the food -- give soy soft serve a try and pop next door for a Tsoynami (Green's vegan version of a McFlurry or DQ's Blizzard). There are so many flavor options and they are all PHENOMENAL.  No doubt if you try once you'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I am not a Vegan, nor am I a vegetarian. I tried this lifestyle in my early 20's and I just couldn't be faithful. I love meat way too much. That doesn't mean I won't accept alternatives here and there. I felt somewhat healthier as a vegetarian and do enjoy eating like one once in a while. So yesterday I tried Green.. Now let me just say, a lot of places I have tried like this have been seriously disappointing. Either it tastes like hydrogenated dog shit or looks like it.. and I once found a rubber band in my Black-eyed Pea Cake at Blossom, but we'll save that story for another review.. Green however, did not disappoint.   Edamame to start, because I am a super fan of it and eat it whenever possible.. I like that they served it with lime. Something I had never thought to add, but it was a nice touch. Then I had the Apricot Miso with mock chicken and pan fried noodles. Certainly an interesting dish, with a stir fry type mix of pineapple, dried apricots, sliced apples, broccoli and some other vegetables, in a sweet yet kinda spicy sauce which was really good. My buddy had the Original \"G\" spicy Po boy, and it was also tasty. You could barely tell the difference between \"real\" and \"mock\", which is hard to do. The interior is super cute and funky. I liked that, but there was absolutely no where to sit, so we went outside and sat in the shade, which wasn't too terrible.. also a good sign that summer is ending sooner than later.   One complaint I do have... bring your own fork! I know it sounds silly but they only have forks carved out of wood, which break upon entering pretty much anything I tried to use it for. .   Definitely try Green. Vege or not, its worth a visit."}
{"text":"The menu has changed And the three things we like the most are no longer on the menu and our favorite dessert the Soynami is now in a smaller cup We did not have a happy day there yesterday"}
{"text":"Really good vegetarian food. The spicy po boy is delicious and so are the chilli fries!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place. It reminded me a lot of Plaid in Tempe, but without the too-hip-for-you attitude from cashier/servers and dingy, cut-corner atmosphere.  the food was delish- i had vegan crab puffs (WOW, these were good!) and a tofu noodle bowl. the tofu was cooked perfectly, but i agree with Blythe down there that it's not \"healthy\" vegan- it's a lot of fried, greasy stuff. also, good call on that's a wrap in phoenix - deeelish!"}
{"text":"Just got here and I'm already impressed that they are doing a joint event with Roka Akor later this month. Great ambiance, service, and food. We ordered the mock chicken wings, chicken Kung pao bowl, and of course the original 'g' sandwich. I loved it- it was very comforting lol. We will def go to the event at Roka and come back to this cool spot."}
{"text":"Green catered my anniversary party recently. I was happy that we were able to offer a vegetarian meal that my whole family could enjoy. I love to eat at the Tempe location whenever I'm in town visiting.   A couple downsides for the event catering was that they provided the plates, and we quickly ran out during appetizers. Luckily my Dad was wiling to run out and grab some, but of course he brought back styrofoam instead of the compostable plates I would have preferred. But really he had no options on such short notice.   The other downside was that the sauces for the chicken wing and the salad were not labeled, so there was some confusion on our guests part as to what sauce went with what.   But overall, Green delivered a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm Mmmmm Mmm........ so good! I was skeptical about mach meats, but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were prepared. We ordered a couple of apps & 2 bowls to try. The apps were good, but my drunken mushroom \"chicken\" was executed beautifully! The best part? The \"TSoynami Clunky Monkey\" was a dessert that I couldn't stop moaning after every bite! Was that TMI?? Just imagine... Soy Ice Cream mixed with chunks of bananas, pecans, and chocolate drizzled throughout. Even if you eat too much and think you don't have room... don't miss this chance - make room!! You won't be sorry.  Overall? Excellent!  I am a fan and can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous! being a vegan/vegitarian wanabee...I would totally hit up this place again.  Go with the non-fried tofu, I actually like it better than the fried."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian but I'm vegetarian friendly.  I'm no stranger to faux meats and tofu.  I've had the \"chicken\" wings a number of times thanks to friends but had never eaten at the restaurant.    I was slightly dubious about ordering the Calexico burger but I was glad I did.  The patties were described as \"vegan\" but as far as I'm concerned, they were made of magic.  For you Midwesterners, they reminded me those wafer-thin steakburgers you get at Steak N' Shake.  Delicious!  The fries were tasty but nothing special.  The lemonade was also quite tasty and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Loved the Animal Fries! I would go as far as to say it's better than the real thing, by a lot!  As for the Big Wac, I didn't really see what all the fuss was about.  I will be back for those fries! Perfection!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the Original Po'boy and it was yummy. The thyme fries were good but lacked a little flavor. My husband had some kind of Peanut Chicken wrap which he thoroughly enjoyed. So much so that he didn't let me try it. Great spot for Vegetarians looking to enjoy a little junk food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Vegan artisan craft restaurant - this is the place! They offer a great menu and everything we tried tasted fantastic! This isn't some ritzy or glitzy joint; it is a focused, Vegan lifestyle cafe. They serve a decent selection of craft beers and also, a variety of wine. They also have a few cocktails they can make upon request.  I would give them 4.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow half star ratings. The ONLY reason I'm not awarding them a 5 star rating is, because their outside seating area needed a good cleaning. All three tables in the rear patio we're sticky and dirty.  The food was 5 stars if you enjoy Vegan meals. We would return and would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The fake crab wontons are great, so is the sweet n sour  noodle bowl. The drinks are good too."}
{"text":"I really do hate to do this but, I have been coming to Green for several months now. I love the food, especially the Big Wac! This is my go to place for vegan food. However, the last few times I have been here the service has really gone down hill. Tonight I ordered at 8:15pm, then sat at a table to wait for my food. Several other people came in after me, ordered, then had a seat. I got my wings at 8:35pm. I started eating then started to notice that the people who came in after me started getting their Big Wac sandwiches BEFORE me. I counted 5 other people who got there sandwich before I did who ordered LONG AFTER I did. Finally at 8:55pm I got my sandwich. It took them a full 40 minutes to get me my sandwich and 20 minutes after my wings.        This is HORRIBLE customer service!! The girl who brought me my sandwich knew I wasn't happy and she did apologize. What I don't understand is, why did several other people get the same sandwich BEFORE me when they ordered AFTER me?        I really do hope they don't keep going the way they have been. By reading other reviews it looks like I'm not the only one having this problem. If you're reading this Green, please fix this problem. If you don't, you could ruin a really good thing."}
{"text":"Amazing food. That simple. This from a non-vegan, non-vegetarian.    I was looking around at local restaurants and stumbled upon reviews for this place. I was shocked to find it was located so close to me, and figured I had to try it, that day. So I did; straight after work I stopped by.    From talking with a coworker, the decor inside apparently changes; when I went in I found it really pleasant. A little bit dimmer than I would have liked, but with strings of white Christmas lights strung up alongside the ceiling lights.     I did not eat in, but looking around, I think I'd feel comfortable doing so, everything looked clean and comfortable, very laidback, slight alternative vibe, but not to where I'd feel uncomfortable if I felt that wasn't me (it's not).    I ordered the thai peanut bowl with mock chicken, and the eggless rolls. The wait was on the order of 5, 10 minutes, nothing bad at all. As I waited, I noticed the bottled drinks...they have Cricket cola. Yes. Next time, I'm taking one home with me. I've been jonesing for Cricket cola for a while now.    Taking the food home I tucked in almost immediately. The thai peanut bowl was very good; filling and tasty. The mock chicken was clearly not chicken, but I didn't mind, it still was good. If you want something a little different, or are avoiding meat, yeah, this is as good as you're gonna get.    The eggless rolls though...to. die. for. They had a note of sweetness to them that moved them from being 'vegan knockoffs' to something wholly unique and delicious. I could see myself purposefully choosing these on their own merits, rather than as a vegan alternative to a real eggroll. I did not expect that from vegan food.    If you're vegan, vegetarian, or just want to try something different, this is definitely an excellent choice."}
{"text":"I've made a few more visits to Green since my original review and have become a big fan. On my last visit I had the Drunken Mongolian bowl with mock beef. I had them spice it up a little with some chile paste and the flavors were amazing. The mock beef is made from white mushrooms. It held the Mongolian flavors very well and had great texture. It's definitely on my ordering short list now."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, fresh drinks and desserts! When in town I go out of my way to eat here. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian either.   Keep up the good food and service!"}
{"text":"There aren't many options for vegetarian in the Valley, and so there aren't many points of reference for Green.  Regardless, everything I've tried on the menu is very, very good."}
{"text":"When I told my friends in New England that I was moving to Phoenix, AZ everyone said the same thing \"you've got to go to Green!\" The coast-to-coast reputation is well deserved; vegan comfort food at its finest. The downtown Phoenix location is even better than the Tempe one with Nami, the bakery right across the street. Service has always been good when I've been in as well. Even if you're not vegan/vegetarian you should stop in."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for vegetarians.  Quite pleased we finally found it at the end of our trip."}
{"text":"I LOVE GREEN.   I've been coming here for years and I've probably recommended this place more often than any other place in the Valley.  Even though this place is hipster and eco-nut central, their mock chicken and mock beef is where it's at. Their array of homemade juices perfectly compliment the main dishes and their hummus platter hits the spot. If you've never been here, you are missing out."}
{"text":"I am a meat eater - let's get that outta the way right now. My vegan son took us here 2 years ago and I was not just pleasantly surprised by overwhelmingly surprised. I never knew vegan food could taste so good; Or to be made like *meat*... and taste good! Both husband and son had the Big Whack - similar to McDonald's Big Mac. Fries - same. I had a mock chicken rice bowl with veggies. My mother had a mock beef rice bowl with veggies. I forgot the names of the menu items, but they were absolutely yummy!  Fast forward to 1 week ago, my son graduated from college and we had his graduation party catered from Green and again, they did not disappoint. Delivery was a little early (great!) We had a taco bar (with all the fixins) and mini beef sliders. Chef Damon is a magician. Not sure how he does it, but all the omnivores at the party were impressed and fully satisfied. Chicken tacos were the bomb! Thank you Chef Damon! Party was a success!"}
{"text":"I love Green. The food is great. It doesn't matter that its vegan it just tastes great and they have a nice craft beer selection. They used to have these awesome Thyme fries that were incredible, but stopped serving them because they had gluten. They do still serve thyme fries, but they are not anywhere near as good in fact I'd say don't even get them they're just \"meh\" at best."}
{"text":"I was searching through yelp for a nice vegetarian place before I fly back home from Phoenix.  Green/Nami is 10 minutes away from the Phoenix Sky Harbor (I discovered) so that was already a plus!  The restaurant has a nice feel to it and and very friendly staff! There's lots of younger people going in and out of it so there's a nice vibe at the place. It has vegetarian as well as vegan options and in general it's a nice progressive place.  I had the huevos rancheros and a vanilla milkshake. The food came out very quickly and was really delicious! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If I lived here, this place would be my jam! Awesome curry bowl with mock beef, and they delivered it next door to the coffee joint. Super friendly service to boot!"}
{"text":"I stopped in during lunch hours. Green has a great menu for those who want to get their greens on in a creative & delicious way....not the bland & stale Sweet Tomatoes way....bleh. They make a nice sangria you can sip with your lunch because you're eating your greens, you deserve it! I will be back often."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale Rd. location is my favorite restaurant and the first place I stop whenever I return to Phoenix. The Big WAC is out of this world amazing. Actually, everything on the menu is fabulous and sure to delight your senses. On the weekends, this place gets packed and the line goes out the door. I'm the only vegan in my group but the food here is so good, I can bring the meat eaters and they enjoy it too. I'm a Green lifer"}
{"text":"I just ate way too much food because it was delicious and I wanted to eat everything.   You get in line to order at the counter. They should probably get more menus- there were just a few that people in line shared. Being my first time there, I would have liked more time to look at the menu.   We got animal fries to share. They're thin crispy fries smothered in cheese (I think it's daiya) and vegan thousand island dressing. Definitely wanna eat that mess with a fork. It was greasy and rich and delicious.   I got a po boy. It had a perfect amount of spice and the chik'n inside was thin and tender and super delish. It was super messy and got orange spicy sauce all over my hands. The omnivore boyfriend got the BFF. It was spicy. He said the breaded chick'n reminded him a lot of a Chik Fil A type of sandwich. His was even messier than mine and he had to scarf it down because it was falling apart in his hands.   Bus your own table. Be sure to save room for dessert at Nami next door. They have super yummy ice cream but the serving sizes are pretty small for the price.   We'll definitely be coming back to Green. I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I try to bring everyone I know to this restaurant. EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE SO NICE!  PS don't forget to try a Tsoynami for dessert (think of a Dairy Queen blizzard but better)."}
{"text":"First time we had great service, all in a creative and fun setting, along with good vegan food! The soynami is great too! We got the buffalo wings, animal fries, the bff and the classic burger. Second time around the food wasn't as enjoyable and didn't taste as fresh, also service was not friendly. Will mention the first time we went was the one in Phoenix, second time in Tempe. Go to Phoenix location!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant with so many options for vegans and vegetarians! I love being able to choose any item on the menu and not have to check if it's meat & dairy free. I've even brought some meat eaters here & they were shocked at how much they enjoyed going meatless! I've had the big wac, chili fries, animal fries, buffalo wings, spinach dip, multiple flavors of the tsoynami and more. Not once disappointed!"}
{"text":"i've tried a few of the noodle bowls with mock chicken-- so good! several of my non-vegetarian friends agree that the food at green tastes great. however, i will admit it's not the place to go if you're looking for strictly healthy options."}
{"text":"This is the greatest vegan restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of visiting.   Most vegan restaurant offer the same fare - tofu with various sauces with a smattering of rice, here and there.   Green takes Vegan cuisine to a new level. Some of the best mock chicken I have ever had.  Everything down to the ice cream.   The staff is always willing to customize and offer suggestions.  I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I typically love the food here, it's innovative, healthy, and a delicious way to introduce vegan cuisine to the general public. I typically also love the staff, friendly, cordial, and seem to fit with the vision of this organization. Today was an exception. I ordered a to go order and arrived promptly. I could see my order sitting on the shelf. A petite nose ringed gal was taken an order to someone. Usually I am acknowledged at very least upon entrance, however nose ring girl was deeply entranced in conversation with the man making an order. While I understand the need for deeper connections between people in a fast paced world, I was in a hurry and starving. I was not even noticed and stood there for about ten minutes waiting for them to be done. She did a good job of explaining the menu but body language and gesture certainly gave light to a clear flirtation. Apparently his name is Dante, not Donte. I took off my sunglasses in hope eye contact would evoke some sort of recognition as I stared longingly at my food. I'm pretty sure she could not have bent over further to see down her tank top, shameless. I get it, young and beautiful abound this place, freedom to communicate and be loose is all good. This is a business as well and I wonder if this conduct of greens operating model. Ok I'm a little dramatic, but the bottom line is my food was cold, my sandwich was congealed and fallen apart, my salad wilted with cold mock chicken. So I just want to thank nose ring girl, my green perception is altered. Thank you to all the other staff who are friendly and a sheer delight, but ms nose ring girl, speaking from experience, being of service to ALL customers is a typical principle in food service. 1 star, not for green, 1 star for nose ring girl who clearly has an affection for up and coming hipster boys clearly I'll accustomed to female attention. Peace."}
{"text":"This was a very welcome surprise when we were visiting Grand Canyon last week.   Our flight was @6 pm and we have ample time.  Since we were a little tired after hiking we decided to find a dedicated vegan place and spend sometime at that restaurant.  I selected it as it was rated high and not too far from the airport. The ambience was very nice and the place was very busy when we arrived at around 12.45 pm last Wednesday.  We were a group of 10 and we ordered a bunch of items from the menu. 8 of the 10 in the group were not vegans.  Overall, the food was great. It is organic to the extent possible and kudos to the owner for pricing it very reasonably.  I even purchased 3 different types of vegan cookie dough and loved that as well.  A must place if you are in the area.  Had a nice chat with the owner and appreciate his service.    I would be going again when in the area next time."}
{"text":"How I love this place.. Living in the city of healthy, organic, locally grown, vegan, gluten free, gmo free, certified rabbit food (aka San Francisco)... I've been to a few of these types of restaurants.  This place has all the healthy entrees one could want without the \"flair\" of a pretentious hipster taking your order.  Best of all everything on the menu looks good.  They simply make things that people like without trying to \"reinvent the wheel\" with some sort crazy food combination/fusion.  I always enjoy eating at a place without having to read some detailed instructions from the chef on how the proper way of eating it should be for the best flavor. (Yes, it's happened)  Since I'm not entirely used to Arizona's 6 degrees hotter than hell heat I have gotten the tsoynamis and their peanut butter and chocolate crack bar.  It's the perfect fix for that sweet tooth craving that I get from time to time, or in this case three or four times this week.  I'm coming back tomorrow for lunch with my beautiful wife and I'm going for the buffalo \"wings\" because they've been calling me day and night.  This place is worth the 673 mile drive and the only bad thing I can say about it is that once I leave this weekend I'm going to crave this place.  Green, you've been good to me this week, you damn well better be here when I come back and don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"I am two months in being vegetarian and have been struggling a little with the transition. Most places I have encounter that are full vegetarian have a lot lacking in flavor and texture. However, this place nails both!!!!! There is so much flavor, and a million things to choose from! They have awesome teas and lemonades, plus a wide variety of adult beverages. The staff is super welcoming and even at their busiest are still super friendly. The prices are very reasonable and you feel full after the meal. My husband was skeptical (as he is still a meat and potatoes guy) but came with me to support me. The chili cheese fries and Big WAC won him over to come here with me. I can't rave enough about this place! Vegan done the way all vegan should be done! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Well that's settled then: I'm moving to Arizona. for a vegetarian restaurant. I love real veg restaurants, they are so few and far between all those places that just serve a veggie wrap and think they are opening up their client base. You can tell Green is the real deal because they list chicken sandwiches, meatballs this, shaved beef that all without blinking.  I went for the original g spicy po'boy and the tahini coleslaw (say what?), followed by a small tsoynami...and perhaps a mini chocolate peanut butter bar. what, it's all health food right?   the po'boy, i will admit looked a little \"po\" with only 3 pieces of spicy chicken, but the flavor was great and i even thought (mayonnaise hater that I am) that the vegan mayo added to the flavor and richness of the sandwich. the coleslaw was just delightful, and i would never have been able to tell that my soft serve was vegan in a blind taste test.  i just saw Eric's review about the mint syrup and chocolate chips, so i'm heading back there for an after-dessert dessert.  the atmosphere is spare, i feel like they could toss a few more tables in there, on the left side where the tables were really far away from one another. There was cool soft music, and I liked that they have two sofas to chill on, and a mini market full of vegan goodies like meatless beef jerky and paul newman's pretzels.    Oh Green, you and I have such good times ahead of us...please bring napkins."}
{"text":"This location has more selection than the central Phoenix location - for instance they do have the vegan meatball sub here !"}
{"text":"I used to love their menu until they made all their food spicy. Bring it back to the way it was guys!"}
{"text":"I love Green. My husband and I have only been vegetarians for about 9 months and we were pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant a few months ago. We have tried many of the dishes--so far my favorite is the Green burger. The food is tasty, the atmosphere is laid back and customer service is usually pretty good. My favorite part about eating at Green is dessert...Betterfingers Tsoynamis are a must for me. It is delicious and satisfying! Really the only reason I can't get myself to give 5 stars is because of their prices...they are a little high for my taste but is not enough to deter me from returning!"}
{"text":"Nice idea but I don't think many of the options here are actually much healthier than their meat-ful counterparts unless you stick with a salad. The place is larger on the inside than it looks when driving by. I had the Big Wac, which was good but not amazing like others report. My friend had a calexico which had a nice hummus/sauce mixture, but was otherwise pretty boring. I don't know....feel like burgers should have some form of veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, etc. Another friend had the thai peanut bowl. The tofu was pretty good but that sauce was so thick and heavy. I'm curious to try other options and check out Nami, but they've got some work to do to impress me foodwise."}
{"text":"Amazing food, i go here about once a month.  Crab puffs and No harm parm are wonderful."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have a fast casual vegan dinning option in the Scottsdale area. I have never had a bad meal here and there are options for anyone, vegan or not!! Note- the mock chicken at Green is the absolute best!!!!"}
{"text":"I looooved this little spot, as a vegetarian there aren't many things on a menu that make you jump for joy. When I looked at the menu, I'd forgotten what it felt like to be able to order anything on that extensive menu! I had the wings and a bacon burger! Definitely going back soon. The drinks/teas are so good and refreshing! They need to have another restaurant closer to the west valley!"}
{"text":"Let me just preface by saying I am not a vegan. Actually, I am the opposite of a vegan and indulge in red meat pretty frequently. However, a good vegan friend of mine wanted to try this place out and I am so glad I did! We went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was packed. The parking situation is not favorable, so try and carpool if you can. Luckily, we ordered and were able to snag  a table at the front. I had the Thai Peanut Bowl with mock chicken and it was surprisingly, really good! It was loaded with fresh veggies and the perfect amount of sauce. The only aspect I found lacking was. . .salt. I'm not sure if I am desensitized by the morbid amount of soy sauce I consume at home - I most likely am. Don't get me wrong, the meal was amazing but I think a dash or two of salt would have made this meal perfect. The mock chicken was also surprisingly yummy. It had the consistency of a frozen chicken nugget (odd) but the flavor was spot on. I would definitely visit again! I am dying to try the Big Wac."}
{"text":"great food, wish it was closer we would come all the time"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Ordered the lemon \"chicken\" pasta. It had so much flavor. Even the mock chicken tasted delicious. The staff was extremely helpful and kind.I will definitely becoming back and trying more food here."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and I loved it.  I had the black jack pita any my friend had the big WAC both meals were absolutely delicious!  I plan on eating here at least once a week."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place tonight and I have to say I was presently surprised. Im a huge meat lover and was very skeptic when my friend raved on this place and insisted on going for dinner. I had the bbbq bacon burger just for the fascination of what vegetarian bacon would be like. Although it resembled nothing like bacon I really enjoyed the \"burger\". The fries were awesome and the portion was good for the $9 I spent. Couldn't finish my fries but left uncomfortably full yet still satisfied. Definitely would be open to exploring the menu upon return."}
{"text":"Maaaaybe my husband and I were here on a bad day. We were visiting from LA over Thanksgiving weekend, stopped by Green Tuesday late afternoon (11/24). I was super excited, because traveling and veganism don't often go well together unless you meal/snack prep for your road trip (which I obviously didn't).   I was extremely disappointed.  First of all, the girl that was working the cash register that day is probably a master of resting bitch face. I went up to order, said \"Hi\" and she just stared at me without saying anything. Even when I asked her a question, she grunted. There was barely any interaction between us, she was your typical emo-vegan-Urban Outfitter clad hipster. Okay, that's probably not fair of me, but she really pissed me off.  Furthermore, a lady came in while I was ordering claiming that she left her car keys or something at the counter. Resting bitch face girl couldn't be bothered.   OKAY, enough ranting about customer service.   Food.  I got the Thee Green Salad, and my husband got the No Harm Chicken Parm Po-Boy. My husband took a bite of his sandwich and didn't eat the rest. But I'm not a fan of vegan, imitation meat, so I'm not surprised.  My salad was boring, they were pretty stingy with everything but the \"fresh greens\". Plus, I asked for no tortilla strips, but there they were...  Blehhhhh."}
{"text":"Wow--this place was a super find! The Big Wac is outta sight! The BFF was yummy & the special of the day, a giant burrito filled with everything but the kitchen sink, was delicious! Oh how I wish there were one in Texas!"}
{"text":"So I must say that the food here is decent . I've noticed prices have gone up on everything . And I understand there's way so much better competition out there now on vegan restaurants. But now it's more expensive AND I personally think that the food is tasting more Commercial ,meaning it doesn't taste authentic anymore . It's losing that fresh cooked taste . Parking is horrible ."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good most of the time, and I like taking my meat eating friends there. However, the service tends to be slacking ... the girls are dressed scantaly which is OK with me .. but kids to come there too ... and the place could look better. Not a big fan of junk on the walls like car doors and what not.   If there as a nicer more adult place with this same food, I would probably never come back"}
{"text":"The soynami shake menu is full of great stuff! Loved the animal fries, and the salad."}
{"text":"Brought a group of non-vegan friends with me to have lunch today and everyone was very happy with the food! We had the buffalo wings, fundido dip, poblano hummus, the big wac with fries, cheesesteak, and the Thai wrap! Everything was amazing and everyone said they can't wait to go back!!! I'd give more than 5 stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"this vegetarian restaurant is good but certainly not healthy. their food tends to be a little greasy at times. also, their portion sizes are extremely unfilling. i usually come and spend about $30-35 per meal just by myself with no drink, which i feel is rather a lot to pay for a date out with myself... to fill me up,  i usually order an appetizer, a large entree salad, and a bowl. their appetizers are a bit greasy and fried. their crab wontons tho obviously being vegetarian have no crab, are just fried wonton crisps stuffed with a little amount of what tastes like philadelphia cream cheese. i did not enjoy those. i do really like their mock buffalo chicken wings tho. i order those a lot. but they can get a little greasy and heavy on the stomach. their salads are decent, but i generally like my salads without the purple lettuce and often times they forget so i end up eating a full salad that is actually the size of a small side salad after half the salad is removed because it is purple... the bowls are my favorite part but they are extremely small and considering there is no meat, is very unfilling on its own, hence my additional order of an appetizer and salad. they are tasty tho! you can choose to order with rice or noodles. the noodles are tastier but makes the unfilling bowl even less filling on the stomach. so i usually get the rice. they have a great amount of sauce in their bowls and their veggies are crunchy and delicious. the ambience is nice too tho sometimes it can get loud. they have an outdoor patio too which is nice. the restaurant opens up into that patio, so it looks pretty nice. tho i have to order more than i normally would at another typical vegetarian restaurant and spend more than i would like each time i come, and have to deal with the upset stomach from all the grease and oil they use, i still come eat here every once in awhile because the food is good, and im not on a diet. they do have many things they could improve upon tho IMO..."}
{"text":"So delicious!! We had the Big Wac, samosas, and the bbq salad. It was all fresh and wonderful.  The service was really good too. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been a meet lover my entire life and tried eating at Green and was pleasantly surprise about how delicious everything was. I am especially fond of the apple, fig salad and the mock chicken wings. For a first timer it was delicious!  Well, worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The food they serve isn't what you would typically expect from a vegan restaurant. They specialize in vegan comfort food, not vegan health food. Lots of fried items and mock meats. Everything I've had here has been great. I really like the chili fries. The chili is super flavorful (albeit really salty, but I don't mind that!) and the fries are super thin, which I love! The tacos are also pretty good. They are surprisingly filling for only being $2.95 each. As a vegetarian who still eats cheese and dairy, I'm not really accustomed to things like fake cheese and ranch, but I've been impressed so far!   They also have ice cream! I'd never actually had vegan ice cream before this but I love it. It's not as creamy as regular ice cream but the flavor is just as good. The soft serve has a mild coconut flavor to it and they have a wide variety of toppings you can mix in.   I'm thankful that I live so close to Green - I will definitely be back many more times to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Took my daughter today and it was a great experience. We got two Big Wacs and the Green Hummus. DELICIOUS! Super friendly staff. Wee took a short stroll next door and got TSoyNami YUM! Will definitely back very soon. I'm a big carnivore and this place is now a goto destination."}
{"text":"I've recently adopted a vegan diet, and Green has given me a reason to never look back! The food was delicious. The crab puffs, kung pao bowl, greeza pizza, and tsoynamis have been haunting my dreams, and calling me back. And this is a hip restaurant that I wouldn't mind going back to. As far as my eyes can see, it looks to be a pretentious hipster hangout, but the atmosphere is so relaxed I can feel comfortable dining in.  There are too few tables for me to give this 5 stars. Green needs to prepare for a crowd."}
{"text":"Yum!  My friend and I were in town for a conference and got tired of gobbling together vegan meals and eating hummus so we decided to try this place. We had crab puffs, Wendy's Pickle, the cheese steak, and fried Brussels sprouts. The crab puffs were right on - crispy, fried, creamy crabby goodness. Out of the two sandwiches, I like the Wendy's Pickle best because of the crispy breading and the perfect pickle taste. They have a nice selection of beers at great prices and the staff was patient with our many questions and made recommendations."}
{"text":"The hubs and I have been veggie for over a year but he continued to resist ordering from  Green...I have no idea why.... we shared the big wac, animal fries and egg rolls. Everything was great and the take out process was a breeze. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Here is an update to my previous praise of Green Restaurant. Consistency is terrible. The quality of their food has entered a progressive downward spiral of inedible disappointments. Calling for management to handle these colossal wastes of money is even worse. Management is not there, absolutely no call backs. My guess is they are too busy being falsely filled with hipster pride to care about repeat customers. For those of you who don't know yet, you will."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!   Sometimes I crave a good steak, some yummy roasted chicken or a slice of delicious roast pork but Green has changed my food wants, recently I've been craving the delicious goodness of Green's awesome food.   From first bite of the drunken mushroom chicken Green won me over. I do love mushrooms but the mock chicken totally fooled my carnivore mind. I love the flavors in the dish and how it was made together. Since my first time last Thursday 3/28 I have been in love with this place. I've had their samosas which are good, the Singapore Tofu noodle, yum yum! the vegan chili fries, outstanding (although next time I'm getting the chili on the side to avoid sogginess)! yes, thyme fries are my new loves. lol. the buffalo spicy \"wings\" are on point. BuT the one thing that makes Green extra awesome are their... Tsoynamis!!! These vegan treats, wait are they vegan? hmm still are worth my cheat days!! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYY! The PB&J is so freaking good, love the peanut butter especially, the butterfinger is just addicting and the banana cream pie is my new crush!   Green thank you for being around and thank you for your awesome bites. love you. Oh and they have Vitmo... yea that's a star for just being kick-ass!! =)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! Everything is pretty much the best"}
{"text":"Very interesting vegetarian choices. They serve take offs on regular fast food, Big WAC (Big Mac). Great place for a non vegetarian to have lunch with their vegetarian friends and everyone can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great casual vegan spot!  My husband and I ate here after landing at the airport and before making our way to Sedona.  I had the Classic burger (which was small) and coleslaw, and my husband had the Dagobah Jungle wrap.  The drinks in the cooler were as interesting as the food menu.  Everything we had was great, and we would definitely go back and order more food next time!"}
{"text":"The thrill of having a whole menu to order from! Yummy little vegetarian place tucked away in a sort of ugly strip mall, and worth the trip. The salads are very large, and unsurprisingly very green, fresh, and full of yummy toppings. The menu has healthy vegetarian options and unhealthy vegetarian options, so everyone can be pleased. I particular like the Mushroom Po'Boy, a really nice take on the normal (and getting boring) restaurant standard of a portabella sandwich. This Po'Boy is full of a savory and solid flavor. The pesto stir fry bowl is also really yummy, what vegetarian doesn't love pesto?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some nice american comfort food, but all plant based, this will hit the spot. A lot of their food is crafted in a way to mimic omni food. The big wac is derived from the big mac, etc. Its a hair on the pricey but definitely worth it. Plus, their sister store, Nami is 20 feet south. You can get vegan pastries and Tsoynamis, which are the vegan version of DQ blizzards. Great place to take a group of mixed eaters, vegan and non vegans"}
{"text":"GO HERE!  Great place.  Easy to navigate.  No servers(yes).  If you don't try the Big Wac..... you haven't really been alive.  Oh and the peanut sauce tofu app is awesome.  Just go here... even if your a meathead.  You will like it too.  And then go get a vegan dessert at their place next door.  I thanked my vegan friends for taking me there and we go all the time now.  Its busy for lunch."}
{"text":"I had their fake turkey special wrap today and it was awesome. Employees have always been nice, friendly and helpful. Definitely making more returns and recommending to others.   For a guy that loves meat, I love this vegetarian style food stop."}
{"text":"Ok, so some people or groups have certain things that are crimes against humanity or whatever.  For me, that is ANY kind of fake meat, meat substitute, tofurkey, whatever.  So I have this job interview and the dude says, \"let's go to this Green restaurant,\" and I'm just dreading it so much.  Somehow I get talked into ordering the mock chicken, and then my world came to a screeching halt.  It's not \"like\" chicken, it's BETTER than chicken.  The texture is perfect, the taste is awesome, and it's not dried out like chicken is most of the time.  I had the Thai peanut bowl, and now I crave it, all day, every day.  But I'm this huge-ass outspoken carnivore with a reputation to protect, so now I'm living a double life.  I sneak there and tell people I went to a Brazillian steakhouse or a BBQ joint.    Hopefully someday I'll be able to come out about this...  (I LOVED the food here, but I really really wanted to knock my rating down one star because the guys working behind the counter yesterday were just the WORST.  Maybe they smelled the meat-eater on me, I don't know, but they were just rude and dismissive and totally inconvenienced to have to answer my TWO vegan-ignorant questions.  Sheesh guys, maybe you want to keep it a secret or discorage newbies or whatever, but please, just lighten up, ok???  Or maybe go out for a burger...)"}
{"text":"So as our last restaurant in Phoenix, I decided to visit Green, due to its great reviews and popularly. I got the Kung Po with mock beef, which was only $7, which is super cheap and really good.  The restaurant is hidden in like a little corner, so it's a little hard to find, but the interior is nice and beautiful. As a tip, just remember that you seat yourself and you have to get the menus at the counter. Took us a while to realized that.  Overall, super cheap, really good and nice place.(:"}
{"text":"Came here everyday while on a mini vacation, most days twice. Tried to conquer the whole menu. Sadly 4 days wasn't enough time. We also had a few favorites we repeated. Some of the items we had; Último taco, San Diego fish taco, chameleon taco, animal fries, chili cheese fries, BFF sandwich, buffalo wings, big wac, classic burger, chocolate milk shake, almond oy vey tsoynami, and the house made teas. Not one item disappointed."}
{"text":"Not even vegetarian but the food is always great. Get the Big Wac. McDonald's has nothing on that burger."}
{"text":"The food is good. The order has never been messed up which is rare around here. There have been a handful of times where it was less than stellar. Overall it is a great place especially for non-vegetarians to try vegetarian food with lots of flavor and variety."}
{"text":"I love and will always love the sweet and sour bowl with mock chicken, the bbq chicken sandwich, and, well, basically everything. Great atmosphere, best employees--basically do yourself a favor and go here, NOW.  If you ever get a chance to eat a Big Wac (like Big Mac), TRY IT. You'll have one of these I can't believe it's vegan moments, while simultaneously sending you into a deep food coma."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Came here on the Fourth of July and had the special. Was a play on BBQ ribs but a sandwich. Surprisingly good!   I will return"}
{"text":"I go to Green on a regular basis, and no I'm not vegan or vegetarian. I've tried several things on the menu and all have been bursting with flavor. You really don't miss the meat, and they seem to do something special with all of their sauces as they all taste great! My faves are:  - No harm chicken parm, this is better than most real chicken parm sandwiches that I've had.    - BBQ chicken, the sauce on this one is amazing!   - Coconut curry, full of veggies and potatoes  - Blonde Alfredo - I don't have to take any lactaid to enjoy this alfredo, and I don't miss the dairy either!  The counter staff is always really friendly and nice. I also like that they have fresh lemonade, limeade and iced tea. I would highly recommend Green."}
{"text":"I can't even. I have found my new favorite place and I'm not even vegan. I could eat here everyday. I placed a to go order for lunch as my office is right around the corner. I got the Big WAC and rosemary fires. I do not eat beef at all but was curious to try this. It was absolutely fabulous. It looked, smelled and tasted like a Big Mac but so much better because it's not meat. I can't wait to try everything on this menu. I'm coming for the faux barbecue chicken wrap next."}
{"text":"\"Vegetarian never tasted soo good\"  No really, I have been continually impressed. I have been here about 3-4 times and this place has yet to disappoint.   SO let's talk about SOME of the things I've had: Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\" Chili Fries Crab Puffs Egglessrolls Samosas Lemon Pesto (with noodles and chicken) Big WAC (play on the big MAC vegetarian style) Sloppy Joe (Soy Chorizo)  I mean.. this place was soo good, I convinced my meat-loving co-workers to come with AND even they make requests to go back. That's when you know you are on to something.  Let's talk about the people: FANTASTIC. They are patient, answer all of your questions, help you to explore the menu, sauces, sides. Don't like something.. no problem! They are happy to resolve (this hasn't happened to me, but they thought it did and pulled out the red carpet).  The place is super cozy and cute.   Most importantly.. you are in and out quickly and they bring your food as it is prepared. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what the hype is. I don't like their buffalo wings. They're garlicky and have a strange smokey flavor. I just wanted regular buffalo sauce. I asked for it, but they still came out in this weird sauce. I ordered the chicken po boy and the sandwich was so soggy I actually took it home to try to re-toast it. It had such a weird flavor. The frys were good, but soggy as well.   The peanut thai chicken salad is good but I've definitely had better. Don't get me wrong - it's nice having a vegan burger joint but I'm just not a big fan. It's too expensive for the hype that it gets.   The parking is awful. I wish they were open for sunday breakfast. That I would actually go back for! But unless they do that, I won't be going back and wasting another $20. I should have just gone to true food! I could have gotten a salad and a sandwich for less than $20."}
{"text":"My burger was super salty and the costumer service was not great. My husband asked the cashier a question about an item they use to have on the menu and the guy was super rude to my husband. Im never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm I have been hesitating to write this review because I want to like this restaurant. I want to like it so much. I just love having a dining option that has ingredients that I recognize. I have eaten here three times. Each time my food has tasted completely different. I ordered the Singapore orange rice bowl twice. The very first time I got it the tofu was cooked perfectly but the vegetables were horrifically overcooked and were the same quality as the generic frozen vegetables I can get at my local Fry's.... The second time I ate there I had the Wendy's pickle. The sandwich was not disappointing per se but the mock chicken patty was too big. I don't know how to explain precisely what it felt like biting into it. If Green is trying to re-create a chicken patty using texturized soy protein etc. etc. then they're missing the part where the patty needs to not be large... This sandwich would've been perfect if the patty had been exactly half the size it is. The second time I ate the Singapore orange dish (which would've been my third visit to green) the sauce was so salty-the sauce tasted like they had made the sauce out of soy sauce than reduced it and then added more soy sauce and then salted it. The tofu was perfectly cooked again and this time the vegetables appeared to be fresh vegetables and they were cooked perfectly crisp tender. Had I not had the sauce the dish would've been perfect. I really like the idea of this of this restaurant however when you look at the menu and compare what's on the menu to the food there is a distinct discrepancy. Either the owner isn't being honest or the general manager can't keep a consistent staff in the kitchen. Until something changes I will just take my business elsewhere or make my own version of Singapore Orange at my house."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So many interesting and creative choices. I had the BBQ bacon burger which has portobello mushrooms and caramelized onions and, of course, their veg burger patty. It was so satisfying. The cole slaw was yummy too, peanutty. I had a \"mash\" for dessert - they choose what to put in your ice cream. Yum!! I wish I could eat here every day..."}
{"text":"We came here last Thursday for the Thanks-living dinner and I cannot believe how yummy everything tasted. I really never get to eat on Thanksgiving because I don't eat the food being vegan. I am going to definitely have my parents and family join next year for Thanks-living, you don't have to be vegan to enjoy such a wonderful meal. My cousin and I decide to make this our tradition from now on. Thank You for prepare a cruelty free amazing meal, we had such a good time."}
{"text":"My friend and I both had the runs after eating the poorly prepared food here. I only was able to eat half of my lunch because it was so unpalatable. Not impressed. Try the Loving Hut you'd be happier"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a brief and very busy business trip and only had one evening to try Green New American Vegetarian.  I'm glad I found time for it.  I ordered the small ranchero salad (which was substantial enough to have been my entire meal) and the special, which was a sandwich of tempura cauliflower with melted cheddar, pickled beets and a spicy sauce (I don't remember what it was).  I took the components off of hte bun becuase the salad was filling me up, but was very pleased with the dish.  If I lived in Phoenix, it would be very difficult for me not to get that salad every single day.  It was delicious, hearty and perfectly dressed.  The service was quick and pleasant and the space is welcoming.  Check it out!  I know I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant I have been to by far! Recommend the \"Big Wac\" and the \"tsunami fluffed nutter\"! Excellent service and very clean"}
{"text":"An adorable little restaurant with a great menu! \"No meat within 250 feet\" the server extolled with a grin. I had the spinach dip and crab puffs (both delicious). My friend had a \"bowl\" and could only eat half it was so large. Apparently a sister restaurant just opened next door with vegan breakfast and dessert... but we were too full to try it. Lovely little place."}
{"text":"I work here once upon a time and it's still my favorite Vegan spot on Earth next to Native Foods when I was in Chicago. If I could buy a bottle of their buffalo sauce and ranch I would drown everything I possible could in it because it's -that- good. Great for both healthy and junk food options."}
{"text":"Fantastic gluten free buffalo wings, though the Alfredo bowl is very bland. Be sure to check out Nami nextdoor after!"}
{"text":"This was the first place my friends brought me to when I finally became vegan. I was hooked! Nice variety in the menu and the food is great. Even my non-vegan friends and family approve! The burgers are fantastic (my dad, a meat and potatoes kind of man, was thoroughly impressed), the buffalo wings are great, and the crab puffs are yummy. My nephew's chicken nuggets seemed a bit over seasoned but he didn't mind munching on our food. I've always been an ice cream addict and I can totally vouch for the tsoynamis - delicious without that yucky \"I've had too much ice cream\" feeling. I will be returning again and again and again."}
{"text":"Greens has crossed from being a cool relaxed vegan eatery to an arrogant hole in the wall with mediocre food.  Luckily I am almost done with every aspect of the God Forsaken Phoenix area (finally back to So Cal in 2018) but decided to give Green another shot for a quick lunch.  Being a workday I did not have 2 hours for lunch and thought I would be pretty safe ordering a damn burger and chili....   Wrong!!! It took 45 minutes to get my order due to the supposed reason that more Chili was being made. Well when I finally got my order the Chili was cold and the burger was so so.  In addition ( and this is where the arrogance comes in) the kid who brought my order forgot to bring a spoon for the Chili and when I went up to ask for one a pimply faced girl who was working the register gave me attitude.  Keep your attitude to your self and Greens staff should visit vegan restaurants in LA or the Bay Area to see how it's done.  On a side note last time I ordered at the Green midtown location it took an inordinate amount of time to get my order there as well..I should have remembered that before going in today"}
{"text":"Omg omg omg! I love this place! You must try the Big WAC and veggie wings! Always my go to vegetarian place!"}
{"text":"Food on point. We came across this place on google maps. The mac burger is awesome. Fish taco on point. Staff is great. This is def a good spot for comfort vegetarian food."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful eatery. We drive by a host of vegan friendly dining on 7th St. North of McDowell Rd weekly. If you enjoy fresh, appetizing and healthy food don't miss an opportunity to dine at this hipster and down to earth eatery.  As we dined there were beautiful people everywhere. (Lunch time) The food is more of an incentive. We had the vegan mexicali burger (delicious), fries (nothing to write home about) and refreshing refillable Berry lemonade. (Four different flavors).  Total bill was $11.50 plus tip  Mikey he likes it!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2008, and I have to say...it's all good, every time! The service is always friendly and outstanding, which goes miles with me...but add to that such a great, unique and tasty menu that non-vegetarians like me are swayed to eat veg. I mean, vegan po' boys, kung pao, coconut curry, garden burgers, meatball sandwiches--all of which are tastier than the so-called \"real things\". I had the spicy bbq chicken sandwich with a side of curry pasta salad today, which rocked, and with a friend who hadn't been in yet, and who, I'm sure, will be back. May I also suggest the thyme fries, which are a bit of awesome. I don't care about the so-called \"scenesters\" that one reviewer was complaining about. I like that they replaced the standard soda fountain with a lineup of kombucha, Izze, and other healthy drinks. I just eat happily and enjoy myself here, and notice that everyone else is generally doing exactly the same.  Go Green!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian for almost 20 years, it was refreshing to find Green.   It's great to be able to enjoy a BBQ pulled pork sandwich or crab puffs... without having to sacrifice an animal.  More restaurants now are becoming vegetarian friendly, but there is something to be said about not having to choose between a salad and a Portobello burger, I can eat everything on the menu!   My absolute favorites are the thyme fries, Texas \"Moo-shroom\" Po-boy , and the orccietta pasta.  The food is tasty, but the atmosphere reminds me of a local dive bar.  I have only eaten in the restaurant twice; it's kind of an \"artsy\" place and not really my style.  I order takeout regularly though, the service is great and the cashier is always super friendly.  My boyfriend is a meat eater, and enjoys their food, he actually suggests it!   I recommend substituting Green for your next trip to Chili's and see what you think. I think you will be pleased, especially as a vegetarian or vegan."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with this place.  We make a point to stop here every time we are in town from Vegas. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is extremely inviting.   This last time was just unfortunate, we put in an order to go, go out to use the facilities. Come back and wait for our food. We begin to notice how people who came in after us were getting their food so we made a comment about that to the person we ordered with. She looked at us blankly went back into the kitchen and proceeded to run out food. 20 min goes by, nothing. 30 min goes by, nothing. She walks right by us a numerous amount of times so we decide to say something.  They found our food and say, \"we called your name out 20 min ago.\" Hands us our now cold food and sends us on our way. Wow! What service?!? I wish there was an \"I apologize we were really busy and didn't notice that you've been sitting right in front of us for 30 min\" instead we were made to feel like it was our fault and sent on our way. A little disheartening for someone who goes out of their way from a different city to visit.   ProTip: They are not paying attention to detail, so if your food takes longer then 5-10min say something otherwise your food will be cold."}
{"text":"DE-LICIOUS!  SOOOOO worth the trouble of finding a parking spot. The parking is a bit tight. But one you're in, you may not want to leave. It's hard to find truly tasty healthy vegan food. I had the most tasty Thai Peanut veggies w/mock chicken. SOOOO good. And  I had to try the crab puffs.....an acquired taste...but still pretty good. $15 with drink left me happy to know I ate super yummy \"greens\".  Then after wards, I had to go next door to Nami and try a vegan cupcake....and take one or two home to my daughter. So nice to find a place that uses alt to dairy. Blah!   Go try out Green. You'll become addicted."}
{"text":"Great food, service and vegan options. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with Green. I'm not vegetarian at all, but their fare is substantial and provides a very effective meatless dish with substance. Their meatless chicken wings are really good and have a realistic texture.   The facility is pretty good, and can get crowded at lunch (a good sign I'd think). It definitely has the \"green\" theme going. They have a pretty decent little vegetarian grocery (a couple of shelf units of stuff near the register) that have things I'm tempted to buy just to try them out."}
{"text":"I love going to a restaurant and being able to order anything I want; not having to worry about if there's meat in something. Yuck! The Big Wac Burger is so tasty. You must have an Oatmeal Cream Pie for dessert. You MUST. It's so good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Great menu selections, so great that I wanted to try everything.  I tried the vegan crab puffs and they were super yummy.  Trying the pizza next!"}
{"text":"I'm allergic to gluten, so I ordered the hummus plate gluten free which is an option on their menu. I was very clear about this. When the food was brought out, I found out a couple bites into what didn't taste like corn chips, that I was eating flour chips. I asked the lady I ordered from who went back to the kitchen to double check and said, \"yeah sorry those are flour. Here's some corn ones.\" And gave me a small bag of corn chips. All she said was, \"sorry that was a kitchen error.\"   Seriously?! I'm allergic! No sincere apologies, she just hi-tailed it out of there as quick as she could. Didn't offer to comp my meal, nothing. So irritating. Had to leave early because I got sick from the damn food. This is ridiculous. Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"why are people complaining about it not being healthy??? any other restaurant that serves veg food serves ultra healthy food. Green is filling a niche- vegan food that's not uber healthy. vegan food that you can take omnivores to HAPPILY. they've made no secret about what their food is like, you folks are idiots to come on here & give them a low rating cause a veg restaurant that makes no secret of having delicious, albeit not uber-healthy food actually has DELICIOUS, ALBEIT NOT UBER-HEALTHY food. seriously, idiots."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I rarely venture outside of my hood in Scottsdale but I decided to give this a whirl.  I've driven by it for years and never checked it out.  It looks a bit sketchy from the outside but a laid back, sorta eclectic atmosphere inside with cool music and really healthy, fresh food.  I don't know what this \"vegan\" thing is but I think I like it.  This is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and have had a wonder experience each time! Not only do I adore the compassion of this restaurant but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. All my meals here have been delicious! Not the mention the dessert is amazing! So grateful to have a restaurant that serves vegan sweets so close to my home! Wish there was more restaurants like this one"}
{"text":"I wish there was a Green in south Chandler! I finally got up to tempe to try this place. I got the rice & tofu bowl- which was good, but i tried my friends big wac & nami ice cream & holy cow they were excellent! I'm guessing not the most low cal things on the menu but healthier than the animal fat versions!   If they opened a restaurant in the chandler/gilbert area ai would be a regular for sure! I will be back for the ice cream even if it is a drive!"}
{"text":"Wow what a find. They have a great menu - makes it hard to pick. Decided on a lemon pesto bowl with mock chicken and organic brown rice. Good choice!  It came out quickly and was piping hot.  And really good. I actually had to ask them what kind of chicken they use because I thought maybe I was mistaken and it was real chicken. Sigh of relief. no its soy based and specially made for them.  Also tried their rosemary fries and it was quite a large basket of skinny fries. Really good.  Can't wait to try their breakfast menu cuz it looks great"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Customer service rocks! Food is Amazing. Proves anyone can be a Vegan. WOW. Try the Big Wac. It's the best."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Good vegan junk food . I came here high and wanted to cry from how delicious the food was . They seemed to have hired new staff which is all boys opposed to the all girl staff there was before ?  Still excellent fast service ! I agree with there should be a food menu on the wall instead of hand outs . Maybe even pictures of the item too ?"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. It's that high average over a huge number of reviewers that spurred me to eat here four times before forming an opinion. Unfortunately, I have to say, you're all wrong.  It's really baffling to me how so many people apparently like this place. It's amazing that they actually managed to make vegan burgers taste *worse* than McDonald's. Their bowls? The texture is all off. The flavors were not balanced. I've tried four different entrees here, and all were terrible. The fries were also mediocre.  It's like it's vegan food for people who don't actually want to be healthy.  What's really interesting about this Yelp rating is I decided to ask a few friends if they have eaten here, just to scope out what the general non-Yelper population thinks. I asked one of my fellow carnivore friends, and his opinion was \"It's shit.\" Just this past weekend I asked a mostly-vegan friend what she thinks of Green. \"Shit.\" Nobody minced words. All the real people I know seem to agree: it's shit.  I personally like the idea of reducing meat intake; it seems like the moral *and sustainable* thing to do. Believe me, I'm not some anti-vegan, Ronald Reagan-worshiping Republican; I can't stop eating at the delicious, all-Vegan Desert Roots Kitchen. I'll even order black bean burgers at normal restaurants (which are almost always an order of magnitude better than those flimsy, feeble patties they have here). This is just bad food. The only thing worth eating is the tSoynamis.  If you think about it, by serving up this terrible, overpriced vegan food, they're encouraging me to go eat more meat. How immoral."}
{"text":"The spicy and Argentine sandwiches are fantastic. The \"wings\" are usually spot on but the last time were very poorly made. Hopefully that was a one time thing because they're so good! My girlfriend loves their bowls which I've only tasted (they're delicious) but I'm a glutton for their sandwiches. Yet to try their desserts but the drinks they offer are fantastic. Now I need to try their Phoenix location"}
{"text":"I visited Green after not going there for 5 Years! They've updated it to provide more seating. They also serve beer, alcohol, sangria.   If you love vegan food come here. There's a variety of bowls--we had the Asian bowl but they also had curry and others. All looked amazing. You can have tofu or imitation beef or chicken. We opted for the beef, it was sooo good. A little spicy too.   We also opted for the appetizer of queso fundido with chips. It had spinach and tasted freaking amazing.  We also split a crispy chicken sandwich. It had vegan crispy chicken, jalapeños, vegan cheese, and other yummy stuff. By far my favorite vegan crispy chicken sandwich of all time.  Oh and for dessert have a soynami. I don't care if you are full just do it! You will be so happy.  There's a poke gym too here for you Pokemon go players!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location, experienced the other shop a few months ago. I like the parking availability better more at this one, but the inside decor of the other location better. For lunch, I ordered the Big Wac on a GF bun. I was told the patties aren't completely GF. Since high doses of wheat are more a problem for me, I gave it a shot. Truth be told, it was the authentic flavor of a \"Big *ac\" from the other guys, but the texture was a bit off and the GF bun was SUPER HEAVY on my tummy :/ I ended up eating the second half of the burger with no bun. It came with fries (or I got it with fries, can't remember the menu layout) and they were scrumptious! The staff was super friendly and accommodating as I asked my customary handful of questions! Go there to check out the fun menu!  This visit was on 4/20/13."}
{"text":"Green is by far one my favorite restaurants in the valley!  I've been a pescetarian for about 10 years but I try to eat vegetarian when I can.  If every restaurant was like Green, I would have no trouble!  Even my carnivore boyfriend loves their food, especially the Original 'G'!  I've rarely had something there that I don't love and most of the people I've dragged with me have said the same.  Do yourself a favor and try one of their sandwiches ASAP and don't forget the thyme fries!  YUM!"}
{"text":"It should be said that not all vegetarian and vegan food is necessarily healthy.  Sure, a lot of folks adopt veganism or vegetarianism for the health benefits.  But even meatless foods can have junk food appeal.  Perhaps you're scared of going vegetarian and want to try something that tastes just like your favorite chicken wings.  Or perhaps you're already vegetarian, but you're craving a great All-American burger but without the burger patty guilt.  For those of you who've never been to Green, take it from this carnivore.  This is the place to get your junk food fix (and a few healthy fixes as well).  Truth be told I've been to Green a number of times.  The menu has changed a little here and there, but the core of Green's appeal remains the same.  A place where vegan and vegetarian foods can be creatively woven to mimic the foods we all know and love, pushing the boundaries of what vegetables can do.  At first glance it would seem hilariously out of place to see items like a burger, or a cheesesteak or buffalo wings while perusing the menu of a vegetarian restaurant.  But for owner and head chef Damon Brasch, that's the whole point.  Opening the public's eyes to whats possible to construct with creativity and an almost religious devotion to avoiding meat and meat byproducts.  I've had a number of items on the menu in the past including the Buffalo Wings, the Chili Cheese Fries, and even the Crab Puffs.  All vegan, all surprising, all quite tasty.  For tonight's visit with the Yelp Veg Curious UYE crew, I decided to attack an item I had yet to tackle.  You've all heard of the Big Mac (two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun).  Wait till you get a load of the Big Wac.  Same basic recipe, but the patties?  Yup, vegan.  To make it an All-American meal I went with their Thyme Fries on the side and one of their house made lemonades.  Total cost including tax came to about $15.  I would invite any longtime McDonald's Big Mac fan to try the Big Wac and point out any truly noticeable differences in the texture of Green's version of this American food icon.  As with the rest of Green's menu, you find yourself perplexed at how they can make a vegan version of these dishes taste like the genuine article.  To this day I don't know how they make the Buffalo Wings taste like legit chicken, or how they mimic the crab so accurately.  All I can say is Chef Brasch has incredible imagination.  Some dishes I've had here are better than others of course, but even those that fall short are not for lack of creativity.  So if you're among the flocks of those steering clear of meat but want the closest approximation to a meat menu you can find, you'd be hard pressed to find many places in the valley of sun that can accomplish that fete the way Green has.  The prices for the food are also quite reasonable, and the restaurant itself is a pretty cool spot on 7th Street (just be aware parking can be a bit of pain as many Yelpers have noted).  When you do come here, be sure to save room for dessert next door at Green's sister restaurant Nami.  And if you're a suspicious carnivore coming here for the first time as I once was, prepare to be confused, surprised, and delighted.  And most importantly, full."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed with this restaurant.  First the water was unfiltered tap water.  It tasted terrible. I ordered the karma curry rice bowl but it only had about two tablespoons of rice, one small piece of potato and a lot of tofu and cabbage.  It had a good flavor but not much else. My husband had the thai peanut bowl. The \"beef\" was good but again there was next to no rice.  The order taker was very sweet but she was the only thing good about our restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. I appreciate somewhere where I can go and get a meal with some green vegetables that are more than just the garnish and also have some vegan options. My first meal I got a rice bowl and I enjoyed that although it was a little spicy or than I had expected. I realize the description said spicy garlic but I assume the spicy meant the garlic and not the red chili pepper that was also in there. I kept reading about the thyme fries so and my second visit I decided to take the leap and order the fries which is rare for me. I also ordered the peanut bowl gluten free option. The fries were a huge disappointment. I ordered them as a treat, I eat fries once or twice a year. I have no idea what is so special about these fries. There was never a hint of thyme flavor and it's certainly wasn't visually observable. They were just regular fries, nothing special at all, a little greasy and their ketchup tasted weird. The peanut bowl was okay. I'm pretty sure they're fake chicken is deep fried. In my opinion its a wash as far as vegan chicken that's fried vs regular chicken breast as long as its raised properly. If I return to the area in the future I might stop in but I think there's very little on the menu for me and if you want to stick with healthier food you need to order carefully here. The food arrived super fast, a little too fast as I like to wash my hands before I eat. I had no sooner ordered and gotten some water and the fries were on the table. The cashier was friendly and helpful when I was ordering."}
{"text":"Feels a lot like That's a Wrap (which used to be in this location).  I love the overhead door; I love fresh air.  Lots of seating and a bike rack (that doesn't really properly serve a lot of bikes, honestly).  Food was very, very fresh.  I expected (per norm in most places) corners to be cut where not noticeable (see: frying something often masks it's lack of freshness) - corners were not cut.  The three things ordered were all well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The things I oversaw on other tables were also looking mighty tasty.  I'd love to see a few bottles of craft beer here - that's my personal opinion.  Part of the issue is local laws, the other part is those running the show.  Will return, for sure."}
{"text":"Aye I really be trying to do this vegetarian shit but omg the food y'all eat is TRASH. I ordered the wings, crab puffs, & a side of fries. I'm not even gonna go in on the wings cause wtf ew. The crab puffs tasted like straight onion. The fries were cool though. I'm giving the restaurant three stars because I'm not actually a vegan/vegetarian so I'm not sure if the food was suppose to taste the way it did.  In regards to the restaurant, it's a cute little tucked away spot but the parking lot is ridiculously small.   The place was packed, however, my order still came out in a reasonable amount of time so good job on that."}
{"text":"I'm fairly obsessed with Green. Great seitan, love the thyme fries and flavored teas on tap, and the creamy sauces are completely legit. It's brilliantly liberating to be able to order whatever I want without having to ask what's in something or beg for crazy substitutions.  It's neither nor cheap nor overpriced for what you're getting, but it's incredibly easy to spend way too much money sampling new parts of the menu.  Loving the Buffalo bites and pasta bowls. Gotta try the nachos and salads next!"}
{"text":"So I'm going to preface this by stating the probably obvious: I'm not a vegan. I'm much closer to the carnivore end of the spectrum. I like meat, and things you eat with meat, and occasionally vegetables. I accepted an invite to meet someone here with a certain amount of anxiety.  But hey, I'm not new to the Interwebs. So I did a little homework. I looked at the menu and found some items that sounded okay. And I read my friend sunny b's reviews here, because she knows this stuff. This made me a little less nervous.  Carnivores, take it from me: no need to worry. This place ROCKS. The buffalo wings are plenty spicy - I liked them better than any actual chicken wings I've ever had. The samosas were wonderful: a nice flaky crust, and the filling was very savory with an excellent texture. I had the Mongolian bowl with not-beef, which was delicious: good noodles, fresh vegetables, and the only way I knew the not-beef wasn't beef was the texture. The portions were great and the staff was friendly.  For dessert, I got an oatmeal pie: two oatmeal cookies with a creme filling between. DELICIOUS!   I definitely recommend this place, and I will certainly eat there again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Even if you're not a vegetarian, this place is boss! The big wac and BFF are amazing. They textures and flavors are on point."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy and inventive.  \"Crab\" puffs were spectacular, and service very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm not even Vegitarian and I dig this place. Went there with a friend and was pleasently suprised. The ice cream is great! Cool vibe."}
{"text":"Green is a place that satisfies my cravings for comfort food made a little differently.  I first came here with a group of ladies who were mostly, if not all, vegans or vegetarians. I wasn't one of them, but that didn't stop me from ordering a pasta bowl with a meatless add on. It was heavenly. The taste is simple yet more than enough, and the variety in the menu is plain fun to look through! For not being a vegetarian, I come here a lot more than I should.  It might seem that it mostly appeals to young crowds who look for different and conscious approaches to their food, but anyone can try it and fall in love with it like I did. It's well-made food that delivers and makes you feel good while eating it.  Parking is a bit of a challenge if you have a large car because it's quite narrow, but spaces are usually open when it's not busy.   The decor is clean and minimalist; you can't help but fall in love with that Ice-T ice machine, pun intended.   All in all, if you feel pretty cool for coming to place like this, embrace it. It's a rad and one-of-a-kind place to eat at."}
{"text":"Love this place! Only been to this location though and don't make it in as often as I would like. Stopped by after work today and picked up a few orders of buffalo \"wings\" and an order of animal fries. Got 15 minutes away and noticed they forgot my fries . Of course I didn't ask for a receipt and ended up tipping as well. I almost just said oh well not decided to stop back by. To my surprise, started describing what was going on and the employee chimed in and finished my sentence. He hooked it up with a free soynami for the trouble and got me out of there super fast! Way to come through for me!"}
{"text":"This was a very interesting restaurant. The flavors of the food were spicier than most places I've been too. I got the animal fries which I inhaled. They were absolutely amazing. I usually can't eat them and to try them here and have them be so good was surprising. Then I got my salad and it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. The dressing was too much for me and the artichokes were very time consuming to eat. I would like to get something else next time and see if I enjoy it more."}
{"text":"I really like most of what green has to offer. The spicy wings are where it's at! The big wac feels way too dense for me but the taste is pretty good. The Mac and cheez is probably the best vegan one you'll have. My only true complaint is that if you order anything with chopped veggies they give you giant hunks that aren't even cooked all the way through. It's very annoying. Anyway it's a good place to eat cruelty free :)"}
{"text":"Vegans get a bad rap. People seem to think all we eat are sprouts and vegetables. We eats so much more and it is outright delicious! Green is the best example of vegan comfort food! They even serve beer!  Even if you are not vegan you totally have to try this place. Excellent food, friendly staff as well as a really enjoyable atmosphere. Try the por boy sandwiches as well as the great appetizers. The chicken wings are my favorite! You forget that they are not made out of real chicken. Love this place."}
{"text":"For vegetarian fare, these guys are tops in my books.    I've always wanted to eat vegetarian because I knew it was healthy, but every vegetarian place I've been to (or every vegetarian recipe I've cooked, for that matter) has been very ... un-delicious.    Green is one of the few places in the valley that I would jump at the chance to eat at with a friend.  I've had their Kung Pao with mock chicken and it rivaled well known Kung Pao with real ACTUAL chicken.  It was quite satisfying  It's decor is neo-hippie-weird -- but don't let that scare you.  It works with this place.   And don't forget to ask about, save room for, and try a Tsoynami (a frozen ice-cream-blizzard-like treat)."}
{"text":"It's not easy being green, but this place makes it delish ;-)  I ran into Green, well Nami really, looking for frozen desserts; you can't go to Nami and not eventually end up trying Green too. After 5 or so visits, I've never had a bad meal. Lunch seems to be pretty popular here - but never a terribly long wait. Order your meal at the counter, grab your number, find a table, and wait for delivery. The staff are always friendly and smiling - I don't think I've seen someone sad or unhappy to be working here.   On a recent visit the girl at the counter sold me on their daily special, this day's was a bratwurst; vegan of course. Coming with a few options for the side, I settled on their house made coleslaw; which I thoroughly enjoyed. The bratwurst was tasty with a dijan / spicy mustard and sourkraut, but the bun seemed to span the width of three brats and was sliced more like sandwich bread and not like a hot dog bun; I can live with that minor complaint though. I've had their hummus and buffalo wings appetizers, a big wac (their shameless vegan big mac), a thai penut bowl, ranchero salad, and one or two other dishes I can't quite remember at this point; all vegan, all delicious, with my favorite being the ranchero salad - it's my normal go to option here.  I believe I've answered the question of would I come back by actually coming back, once every month or so.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. This spot totally makes it easier to be green ;-)"}
{"text":"This is the best place for wings, burgers, chicken sandwiches and more! They have bomb margaritas and their specials are always a hit. Usually lines out the door whenever I go so I usually hit them up for all my Togo orders. My friends who aren't vegan are always surprised to taste how amazing the food is!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a meat eater, but this place was all right. I had the mock chicken which wasn't bad, I just wasn't very impressed with the bowl overall.  I may give it a second try one day to try something else, but there's nothing really enticing about it."}
{"text":"It says a lot when a meat eater like myself will visit this vegan restaurant again and again. I have never had a bad meal here. Everything has been great from the original G spicy po' boy to the no harm chicken parm or the big wac that is a vegan take on the McDonald's Big Mac. They have salads, sandwiches, burgers, pitas, and all types of food from American to Asian, to Italian and more. They cary the best micro brewed sodas i have ever had. The prices are very reasonable and the employees are always very nice and give great customer service. Today I had Wendy's Pickle which is a breaded mock chicken cutlet with southern style spicy mayo and dill pickles.  The bread is so soft and delicious you would never guess it was made without milk or eggs. The cutlet looks and tastes so much like chicken that you don't miss the chicken at all. Add in the spicy and creamy mayo, and pickles and you have a fantastic lunch that would make anyone jealous wether they are vegan, vegetarian or a carnivore. The dish is served with thyme fries, tahini coleslaw or fresh fruit. I got the fries this time but I have tried the other sides and they are also great. The fries are long shoe string fries that are perfectly fried and have the best potato flavor with a crispy yet soft texture that makes you want to slam them in your face to keep the happiness going as long as possible. My total bill was $9.25 after tax. My vegetarian wife turned me (her meat loving husband) onto this place and I have come here more times without her than I have with her. That is how good this place is. It is an unpretentious restaurant with quality food. You will love it!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly spot for us to grab take-out from. The wings are the perfect substitute for someone like me who LOVES chicken wings but doesn't eat chicken. :)  The bowls never disappoint-- we get the singapore orange and thai peanut regularly. Everything seems simple and not over-done but with amazing flavor. I always feel satisfied and healthy after a meal here. Service is super friendly and helpful for first-time orderers.   The outside patio is a great spot to sit if you are eating in."}
{"text":"I would live here if I could. The vegan food delights everyone I have brought, vegan or not. There are mock meat dishes and regular vegan dishes so everyone can be satisfied. Everything I have had here...and that is most of the menu by now!...is amazing. Staff is friendly and prices are good. But the food...yummy delicious!"}
{"text":"My friends, who are vegans, invited me to tag a long with them one day to this restaurant. I was quite skeptical about trying the food because I'm not vegan at all, but I said what the heck I'll give it a try what can it hurt? I'm not a picky person at all when it comes to the taste of food. Anyways, I was actually very impressed with the taste of my dish, which was the kung pao with mock chicken. After my first experience, I had gone back about a total of 5 more times. The 3rd time I decided to try a new dish, the lemon pesto bowl with mock chicken (my friends favorite dish). This dish ended up turning into my favorite as well. On my 4th visit to Green,  I ordered to go, and got the lemon pesto bowl with mock chicken and requested an extra side of lemon pesto sauce. When I looked in my bag to make sure everything was in their, I noticed my lemon pesto sauce was not, so I kindly asked if I could get the lemon pesto sauce (my friend also requests an extra side of lemon pesto sauce with her order all the time and they have NEVER once forgotten to give it to her). I tried to be as understanding as possible because I know we are all human and forgot little details like that. I will honestly say I was a little irritated because I had to wait additional time for them to prepare it. On my 5th visit, same thing,  they forgot my pesto sauce AGAIN. I was thoroughly irritated because I just didn't get how they could forget a second time after I had specifically requested for the side and the cashier even verbally repeated my order . AGAIN I had to wait for the pesto sauce to be prepared . I decided to give this place another try because I became addicted to the lemon pesto bowl (my 6th visit). I ordered the same thing over the phone, to go. Mind you, they always verify my whole order before hanging up. When I picked up my order and paid, I checked the bag to make sure my pesto sauce was in there.... and once AGAIN my pesto sauce was not in there!! Bitting my tongue I asked the cashier if I could get an extra side of pesto sauce because it wasn't in my bag. The cashier told the people in the back to prepare some.. After waiting patiently about 5 minutes I asked one of the servers walking around if she could check up on my pesto sauce because I was still waiting. She went to the back and came back with the sauce. I left and headed home. When I got home and was getting ready to eat my dish I noticed they had forgotten to add the mock chicken (the best part of it)! I was so freakin pissed because here they had forgotten my pesto sauce for the 3rd damn time and now they forgot my mock chicken! I was extremely irritated that I felt compelled to call and let them know. When I called, I explained to the girl that answered the phone that I was just in there, and I now just noticed that my mock chicken was missing (I didn't bring up the missing pesto sauce) She proceeded to apologize and asked if I would like to come back to get the chicken. I told her I'm already at home (what I was thinking in my head: I live 30 mins away their is no way in hell I would waste gas just to go all the way back to get the remaining portion of my order that you guys screwed up on). After a couple seconds of awkward silence, the girl was unsure what to even do to solve the problem and put me on hold so she could ask a coworker what to do? Really? She acted like she had never received a phone call before about an incomplete order. I've worked in the food industry in customer service so I found it to be very strange that she had to ask another coworker what to do. Maybe she was new? Idk. Anyways after waiting on hold, she came back and told me that her manager wasn't in today and that she would take down my info so he/she could call me the next day to maybe set me up with a gift card for the chicken they had forgot. Which I was totally fine with, all I wanted was the chicken that they had forgotten, that I paid for. The next day came and I never received a phone call from anyone.  I was very surprised that no one called especially with all the good reviews on Yelp, I really thought highly of Green. I was so disappointed with the whole situation and previous experiences with my order that I told myself I'm done with this place. I truly enjoyed the food, but after so many screw ups I gave up and told my friends that I won't be returning. It's just a big headache and a waste of time. Maybe I should have spoken up the first time they forgot, and not have been so polite....but that is not the type of person who I am. I try to be as patient as possible. This is my first time writing a review on anything, sorry it wasn't a good one."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! This was so tasty! Casual setting, hipster vibe (of course), very nice staff. I had \"chicken\" parmesan sandwich which was a special and brussel sprouts which were slightly browned. The \"chicken\" patty was so well-seasoned and had perfect texture. Wish it would've had more marinana with it! Shows you how noone needs to eat meat! Go vegan!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite vegan place. Everything was delicious my son got a burger and cheese quesadilla my husband had the po boy sandwich and I had the thai bowl with chicken. All the food was so yummy ours where a little spicy but good. the staff was all very sweet and nice especially Diana we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian food in all of Arizona.  Even some of my non-veg friends enjoy this place.  The soynami is way better than anything you could ever make or get from DQ.  This is worth multiple visits."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has so much hype. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings, big whac(aka Big Mac except that it's vegan ) and Singapore orange noodle bowl.  Unfortunately the food was not so tasty and the bowl was toooo salty. The big whac was not delicious and the wings were decent. The place is cool and it looked as though the desserts were tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan junk food! I am not vegan. I will never be vegan, but I will throw down with the best of them at Green.  There are so many delicious treats on their menu I'm not even going to bother naming off the things I've tried here. Just go, eat everything, and when you gain ten pounds don't come crying to me.  'But Kristi, aren't vegan dishes supposed to be healthy?' ummmm NO!  If I wanted healthy, I'd poach a chicken breast and eat it with some dry salad and brown rice. Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert. I come here for fake meat that tastes like angel tears. The only thing they're missing is a liquor license.   Located in a strip mall, this place is full of Bieber-esque lesbians and 10 day neck beards just as you would imagine. I don't fit in but when exactly has that ever bothered me? There is even what appears to be a (very tiny) vegan market of sorts inside if you find yourself in desperate need of some Dayia or faux marshmallow fluff. You know, true diet staples. The register area is full of mouth watering vegan desserts that will make you say 'I didn't know you could do THAT with raw cashews!' Man, I love this place...  I haven't heard any news lately about the supposed 'new location' but I really hope that is still in the works as it is much closer to home. I can see myself picking up 3 orders of wings to eat in the privacy of my own abode while watching some god awful Lifetime movies on a Sunday. Bring it on Green.  nom nom nom"}
{"text":"OMG!! An explosion of fantastic flavor in your mouth! Everyone really should check this place out. So many options to satisfy whatever you are in the mood for.  The thyme fries are soooo good!!! And I went for one of the burger options recommend to me. It didn't not disappoint. I went for lunch and this place was packed. Everyone was down to earth and happy and munching away. I am adding this spot to one of my favorite list. Can't wait to try their other items on the menu. I am eyeing that \"Mac\" burger."}
{"text":"Great veg restaurant. Ate here three different times during my trip to the Southwest.   The Big Wac is where it's at. The combination of sesame seed bun, the pickles, the sauce, the thinner burgers, and a side of skinny fries is eerily satisfying in that nostalgic McDonald's kind of way.  The BBQ chicken sandwich was pretty solid. I stole some of my friend's peanut tofu and noodles... they were pretty good too.  I split a Tsoynami - I think it was the smores one. It was good, for being vegan."}
{"text":"This just in, Central Phoenix is getting a Green Restaurant where the old That's a Wrap location is.  Finally a great vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix.  I had the delicious Green Burger at the Scottsdale location.  I don't know what they put in that burger but it satisfied my carnivore side.  There were many options for my side dish.  I had fresh fruit.  I have gone vegetarian two times.  Each time lasted about a year.  I just like the feeling of eating good food and not ending up a bloated beached whale.  Even after I shared a Chocolate Monsoon Soynami for dessert I could still walk out the door feeling good about what I put into my body.  The Soynamies rock by the way.  If a DQ Blizzard and a Soynami got in a taste test fight the Soynami would kick ass and take no prisoners.  Check out Green, even if you eat meat.  The food is excellent and good for you.  Go eat."}
{"text":"This place is FULL of hipsters and I don't even care. I will take vegan food this good from dudes wearing scarves and man-purses. The first time I took my mom here she loudly discussed hunting deer and her desire to eat a plate of raw meat with bones and hair. My mom is kind of a dick. My point is, after she ate here once she's been pestering me to take her back for the last year. So if it's good enough for my mom, it should be good enough for you. Unless you think you're better than my mom. Well, there's a good chance you are. But my point stands."}
{"text":"Very good have been so pleased with the food in Arizona. Hab a Big Wac, animal fries, and crab puffs... So good unbelievable taste. Also got so food for my flight tomorrow including a chocolate chip cookie... All vegan and so good."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth visit to Green, I've tried something new each time.  I continue to be surprised how delicious vegan food can be.  The mock chicken is surprisingly good and I can't believe how good the doughboy is.   I plan on trying everything on their menu."}
{"text":"I have this friend who loves meat.  I mean LOVES meat.  I convince her to meet me here for a meal and being the brave soul she is she gives it a try.  Now I've been here before and I know the food here is good but she's a skeptic.  She orders a burger and fries and the look on her face when she took that first bite said it all.  She was blown away how good vegetarian food can taste.  If you like good food don't let the vegetarian scare you away.  Every item I've tried on the menu is amazing."}
{"text":"Go to Green... it's delicious! No, it isn't low-fat or low-calorie, so I have taken that to consideration and indulge in their food every now and then. Everything I have had (or sampled) is wonderful... with the exception of the egglessrolls. While very large, they were kinda bland with too much wrapper. I definitely preferred the crab puffs over the egglessrolls anyday. Good iced tea and decent iced chai, too. Worth the stop if eating your way through Phoenix being vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everything I've tried is awesome. The Big Wac! Tsoynami! I love the spinach dip! I only wish that there was one closer to me."}
{"text":"Haven't been back here in a few years and I was surely impressed by the expanded and creative menu!  Glad it's not limited to rice and noodle bowls anymore but VERY sad they got rid of the noodles option!  I was so disappointed that I almost didn't know what to order.  Once I chose and tasted, I forgot about those noodles.  I can't recall the cool name of the salad but it was tons of hearty fried Brussels sprouts in jerk spices atop deep green kale glistening in a thin layer of oil (possibly slightly cooked?) with spring mix, shredded carrots, tortilla chip strips, and a \"jungle dressing\" that had a creamy orange color and amazing taste.  I was hesitant that the salad without any meat or mock meat would be filling enough so I ordered a side of thyme fries.  The salad ended up being sooooo substantial that I was stuffed and could barely eat any fries.  Fries were only okay...missing some magic.  I cannot stop thinking about how delicious, crunchy, green, and flavorful that salad was!  I will be coming back more often and next time I'm getting the same salad with their awesome mock chicken added to it!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! This restaurant puts you on hold any time you call to place an order and the don't have a pickup line for people who call in orders. I waited around 15 minutes to  pick up 1 sandwich and 1 shake. My PO boy sandwich was garbage! It was all smashed up and soggy. They don't know that if the food is to go that you don't drown it in sauce. I wrote a Google review months ago but I've had more than one horror story at this place. So I'm never going back. I'm sticking with loving hut!"}
{"text":"Very delicious however they've increased their prices which is disappointing. A burger doesn't even come with fries anymore. This is a love hate kinda post. Not really sure if I ever wanna go back but there's not many vegan restaurants around town. Such a dilemma."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat. I've been eating here for the past five years and it just keeps getting better. The employees are super friendly and the owner is as well! They are very active in supporting the causes in which they believe and their delicious comfort food is really high-quality. It's not like many vegan restaurants that leave you feeling like you just heated up a bag of soy protein in your own kitchen and hoped for the best. There is true effort and thought put into every meal and they update their menu often, to meet the demands of their happy customers!"}
{"text":"So maybe Im the wrong person to review a vegan resteraunt, but hey I like to try it every now and again and expand my horizons.....besides I was next door getting my bike worked on and it was close....  We ordered three entrees (which was waaaay too much but hey it all sounded and smelled great so why not?)  All of our meals were okay...but seemed to be one of three things;  So sweet and sticky that it gave me a sugar high like a spent the past three hours watching cartoons and eating a box of fruity pebbles (Mock Chicken BBQ)  Ridiculously Spicy.....(I usually love spicy food and have a high pain threshold for spices but this was ridiculous)....It was like eating a river of peanut flavored magma in noodle shapes in theory delicious but not with whatever spice they decided to 'pep it up with'.....(Peanut Chicken Noodle Bowl)  Salty....Like if my tongue was swimming in the dead sea......with more salt (Waitress Pick I think it was some form of mock Hamgurger?)  Im giving you a 4 as I recognize Vegans have limited choices, it was our first time, and Im not really used to tthe vegan menu but for me I will try another day maybe some different choices.....  Pricing was good, atmosphere was tacky but somehow charming......we will try it again."}
{"text":"I love this place!! My only complaint is I wish I lived closer!! I haven't had a thing I didn't like. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is their Chili Cheese Fries and Buffalo Wings. You must try them! Fresh salads and ingredients, they make being a vegetarian sinful!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best one I have ever been to.  They're menu is amazing and they just recently made some changes to it so I am excited to try some of the new dishes.  I can't help but go every week at least once because it is so good.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  They have such a wide variety to choose from.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"REJOICE, Phoenix vegans! Although it's a huge guilty pleasure, this is the best junk vegan food spot. Thank you Green for turning my once carnivore man into a coming-back-for-more veghead. The prices are amazing, the servings are always enough for leftovers, and the specials are well thought out. Staff is always pleasant and actually seem like they're happy to be at work. We're always happy to make the 30 minute drive to each location. Green, THANK YOU! PS- get the Big Wac. :)"}
{"text":"Green is my favorite restaurant to visit when I go home.  Yummy, fun food.  If you go to Scottsdale, Phoenix or Tempe for any reason...add this spot onto your to do list! I like their vegan \"crab and cream cheese\" puffs, the samosas, the faux chicken sandwich, the meatball sammie, the portobella poorboy, their FRENCH FRIES!!!  But the fave for me is the Cap'n Crunch SoyNami!!  You have to try it to understand.  AND YES, your animal eating friends will love it too!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not sure if I liked it too much the last time because I came on Name Your Own Price, but they called it Karma Something-or-Other.. or, if because I was just super stoked to be able to eat off an entire menu if I wanted to, being vegetarian, and all. Either way, I came back exactly a week later and was, well.. \"over\" it.   The guy at the counter was kind of rude, but not really, but still was...I don't know, it was weird. He just seemed a bit unfriendly, but then I saw him flirting with a waitress, so I don't know.. Also, the food really is a bit overpriced. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious, but I don't think it's necessarily worth the price.   It's a good, \"occasional\" thing, but I don't think my next Green Occasion will take place for a long while."}
{"text":"The ambience here is super cool and the menu was great with lots of items. They even serve beee too! Good place to stop-by if you are a vegan"}
{"text":"I do enjoy this establishment. Everything is vegan, even the bathroom soap!! The girl whom took my order was very kind and welcoming. My only complaint is the food that tastes good here is really bad for you!! Haha I normally like healthy food too but here I haven't been blown away by anything some what healthy on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan/vegetarian, so this was a new thing for me and I loved it!  If this is clean eating, gimme more.  I've only eaten at the Phoenix location once and the Scottsdale location once.  I definitely recommend the vegetarian Big Mac thing, even though I'm not a fan of McDonald's.  The fries were delicious too.  I liked that they had a couple different kinds of teas and you can refill your drink with whatever you want (or buy the glass bottle drinks).  The atmosphere is trendy and fun, right in line with the food.  The staff and the other customers all seemed friendly, even the biker-dude eating on the patio.  I guess this kind of food makes you feel good about eating for once.  I wish we had a Green even closer to us in East Mesa."}
{"text":"Good? Yes. Great? Perhaps, in time.  I'm just still missing Watercourse Foods in Denver, and it's hard not to compare.  The vegan wings here were ok, but nothing like other places I've had. We were hoping they'd be more like buffalo wings, but the sauce was far more Asianic.    That said, everything we have ordered (dumplings, samosas, stir fries, sandwiches) has been good, just not quite outstanding.  I love their Thyme fries though -- delish.  Service was a bit slow, but I've learned that this is standard fare in vegan/veggie places, so it didn't bother us much. The people watching, plus artwork on the walls, made the time pass quickly, and the staff themselves were incredibly outgoing and friendly.  I definitely want to go back and try an Tsoynami -- they're just a little pricey.  Will have to wait till I'm really craving.  I love that they have lots of vegan items for sale; they have some hard to find things that lots of my vegan friends love. It's hard not to overspend.  I like their tea/limade/tamari drink options as well; can be fun if you mix them, and I love that their cups are compostable!  All in all, a great vegan spot to get something comforting, but can be a little pricey for a \"quick service\" style place."}
{"text":"Came here to try the \"Big Wac\" and I was not disappointed. I usually stay away from imitation veggie/vegan burgers. The flavor was great, didn't taste like \"fake meat\" at all. It was also very filling. I ordered the Thyme fries as a side. For the price, I was underwhelmed. Thin cut and the Thyme salt flavoring isn't really that pronounced. The burger is definitely enough on it's own and the drink selections are delish!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for sure.  The Tai Peanut Bowl is amazing as well as everything else there.  Great environment and great food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal vegan food. I travel 20 minutes to Green & Nami regularly just for their specialty gluten-free and vegan offerings.  I recommend it to all of my clients and friends."}
{"text":"So many good Vegan options here. Too many to name. If you're vegan and need that Dairy Queen type fix too, the soynami here is where it's at."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place. Went here for the first time some weeks ago and went again today. Both times I got the Big Wac which seems to be their most popular item. I mean, I'd planned to try something different but after poring over the menu I just couldn't pass up the Wac again, as many of the other dishes sounded spicy and I didn't particularly want a spicy meal today for reasons I'll keep to myself :-)  People-watching while waiting for the food to be delivered was interesting. This place definitely has a certain type of clientele. Flesh-colored yoga pants, tree-hugger sandals, tattoos even shittier than those you might see at Pita Jungle (which is definitely saying something), the rogue's gallery of patrons brought a wan smile to my face at least once a minute until lunch was served.  The burger itself is surprisingly tasty. They lay on the pickles pretty thick, and it doesn't have much cheese or ANY tomato, but even so it was soft and delish. The fries were meh. They call them thyme fries, but I pretty much didn't see any thyme on them - maybe a few microscopic dots of green? But for the most part, just regular shoestring fries, maybe a bit drier than normal, and far from the best fries I've ever had.  Great thing about the meal is that you somehow don't feel shitty afterward. After a regular Big Mac I'm filled with self-loathing. An hour after my Big Wac I was happily enjoying an afternoon coffee and feeling pretty good.  If I could suggest one thing, it would be for these guys to pick different names for their menu items. Fun to read at first, but if McDonalds, Wendy's etc (they also have an item called \"Wendy's Pickle\") catch wind of their trademarks being used like this it could spell big trouble real quick. Maccas probably have more lawyers than employees! One whopper of a law suit (see what I did there?) could probably take this joint down. Plus it's difficult to say \"I'll have a big WAC please\" at the front counter without breaking out into a shit-eating puerile grin. Oh, and another suggestion - arrange more parking space. The parking SUCKS. Assholes parking on the left and right of the place make it almost impossible to manoeuvre anything bigger than a VW beetle around and out again. Good luck with your F150s, nouveau cuisine gourmands..  Also, fix the fries. They're not worth the money you're charging for them.  That all being said, I'll definitely be back! And MAYBE I'll try a new menu item next time round."}
{"text":"There's nothing better than a bunch of spunky vegetarian restaurant people. So, the people were great and helpful when it came to my first-timer questions about what to order (vegan gyro, singapore noodles) for the hubs and me, and plain lo mein noodles for the kiddo. My concern always about a serious vegetarian place is that they skew snobby, rather than populist and happy. Green is the latter. Go Green - nice work! PS: yes the food is awesome. Just eat here, even if you like meat."}
{"text":"For some odd reason I got a wild hair up my butt and wanted to try a vegetarian restaurant.  I still have no idea why.  My wife and I are not vegans or anything close to it, but I still wanted to try something new and exciting.  I wanted something close to home and Green was rated the best in my area so I figured what the heck.  The place looked exactly like what I expected.  I am totally preppy so my only words to describe it is \"hippy\".  The place was pretty packed with weird hippy people but everyone was very nice.  It wasn't really my scene but it didn't matter because I was there for the food and a new experience.  When my wife and I first entered the establishment we first waited for a hostess to seat us for a few seconds.  Then, after figuring out that it was probably a seat yourself type of place, we took a seat and waited for a waitress/waiter.  Most of the other tables had people looking over menus so we figured that a waitress/waiter took orders.  After a few minutes of sitting, we decided that we should probably go up to the counter and order.  Not that I had a problem with it, its just that it was very confusing.  Anyway, here is the rundown of what we ordered and my rating of it.   * spicy buffalo wings - they didn't look like it, but they did have the texture and flavor of real wings....kinda.  The sauce was good and spicy but was very very salty.  The \"ranch\" was good too.  I would order this again.  * artichoke gratine - very good and pretty spicy - I would order again  * green burger - neither myself or my wife was a fan of this.  * diablo red bowl - I actually thought this was good.  Aside from it being very very very very salty, the dish was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it.  I ordered it with mock beef which somehow had the texture and flavor of beef.  All in all I thought this place was ok.  The staff is friendly, the food was ready quickly and the prices are reasonable.  My only real issue is with the food.  Since I don't have any issues eating meat, I would just assume go to a place that serves real meat.  This place goes through a lot of trouble to make food that tastes/looks/feels/smells like meat for a bunch of people that don't want to eat meat.  It is all very strange to me.  Although I probably won't be back unless I develop a severe allergy to meat and dairy, I would recommend it to people who want to try something different.  You probably won't find a better place to try out the vegan lifestyle and truly appreciate your carnivorous ways."}
{"text":"Wow! I tried out some of their food at the Phoenix Local First Festival last year and loved the faux chicken wings. They were delicious. I had planned on going to the restaurant but had mostly forgotten about it until recently when a friend of mine had a birthday party there.  I was so impressed! Everything was delicious. I had a little bit of everything at the table and enjoyed it all. I ordered a Po Boy sandwich for myself. It was tremendous! A little spice on the previously mentioned chicken wings.   They had some truly stand out hummus. Absolutely incredible chili fries...I'm going back soon. So good!"}
{"text":"Don't get intimidated by the line out the door, they're very efficient here. If you are in a rush, call in an order. This fare is vegetarian comfort food.   Their mock chicken is really tasty, but eat it when it's nice and hot. The texture changes slightly when it's cold.   The Dogobah salad with crispy Brussels sprouts is really good.   Last summer, I brought about 6 or 8 people from a conference here with me and ended up being a big hero everyone loved it so much.   Don't leave without trying a Tsoynami frozen soy dessert. It is really a great treat.   Check out their Tip Jar...every day it's so creative and amusing."}
{"text":"The artichoke chicken salad is great! And the almond milk milkshakes are a guilty pleasure of mine. :)"}
{"text":"we love green. bff. cheese steak. fish taco. animal fries = victory...tyrell was great. all the employees are dope.   gonna marry the person i came here with for lunch :D love you"}
{"text":"So good!! Meat tastes like the real thing too..."}
{"text":"There are not enough starts to tell you how I truly feel about this amazing restaurant.  I am not a Vegetarian, and I LOVE this place.  The food is amazing.  The quality of the ingredients is second to none and the flavors are addicting.  I started a new job down the street from the 7th street location 4 weeks ago, and I think I've been at least twice a week since.  I'd be there every day if I could afford to eat out every day :-)  I've never had a bad meal, bad service or a bad experience.  I have been going to the Tempe location since shortly after they opened.  There is no difference in the food from one location to the next.  The only down side is the parking situation at the Phoenix location.  But for this food, I'll drive around the block til a spot opens up, THAT is how good it really is."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I order becomes my new favorite! I love the Wendy Pickle, the BFF, the \"wings\", the brussel sprouts... Of course, you'll want to save room for dessert! Love the Coco loco tSoynami!!!"}
{"text":"This is a \"must-have\" for locals and visitors! Whether you're looking for comfort food, a naughty snack, or healthy fare, Green has something for you. My favorites include the \"wings\", the BFF sandwich, the Wendy Pickle sandwich, the brussel sprouts, and the Thai peanut bowl. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Be sure to finish up your experience with one of their famous Nami tSoynamis!"}
{"text":"Sooooo damn good. After I decided to go vegan it was awesome to find this local gem. They have some super healthy options and they also have some \"cheat food\" like the Big Wac. I crave that puppy:) Better than a real Big Mac in my opinion.  Make sure you get a Soynami!! (non-dairy ice cream treat)"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is delicious. Actually, I eat the Wendy's Pickle every single time, so really I don't know about the other food. But my partner's tried some other stuff and really liked it as well. Very reasonably priced, friendly staff. Love coming here when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Plastic white object was found in my food this plastic was so thick it actually hurt my tooth feeling confident of my food I bit into my big wak and hurt my tooth because of it. I was not given a refund but just a gift card of 25 when I had purchased 2 big wak meals and drinks I liked this restaurant but I did not feel appreciated as a customer nor satisfied"}
{"text":"FAVORITE! This place is such a gem. Every time i  travel to the PHX area I make sure to stop here. Anything I've ever had was amazing and filling. The staff is pleasant and the owner is super nice. Hope they come to Tucson soon!"}
{"text":"While I love Green and I have reviewed before about how fantastic it is, I've since noticed certain things on several occasions.  #1. When I order take out the portions are always smaller than when you are in the restaurant. I get home thinking I'm going to be able to share with my fiancée only to find that it is a much smaller portion than at Green. Just today I called in for takeout, and for how much the wings and crab puffs cost you barely get anything. Definitely doesn't seem worth it. Vibe buster.  #2. The mystique has sort of worn off and I'm now seeing Green for what it really is: a vegan's junk food spot. Which isn't a bad thing since we all need one of those, but it's sort of disheartening to those that'd like to be a bit more healthy. Not all of their foods are complete junk food but I wouldn't call it healthy.  #3. They're pretty secretive about what's in their food. I went up to the counter to ask where they get their mock chicken from (because it's freakin' delicious and I pretty much hate all other mock chicken I've tried). The guy I asked basically babbled some spiel about how they go through so many distributors and get them from all different places. Knowing full well that he was basically saying he couldn't tell me, I asked anyway if he could tell me a specific brand name and he said no. Any other veg place I've eaten at has been more than happy to divulge this information. Did that suddenly make me stop going because I wanted to make all of the dishes at home myself? Of course not. The whole point of eating out is for the fun of it. That really bummed me out.  Green, I hate to say it, but you've kind of disappointed this vegan. Now I'll sulk away and go research Google for some awesome mock chicken."}
{"text":"I visited Green and was overwhelmed by the vegan and vegetarian options. The menu is both affordable and family friendly. I wasn't greeted right away by any servers, so that was lacking but the overall vibe was good. Though I enjoyed my meal, I don't foresee myself going back anytime soon, if at all."}
{"text":"Very good, healthy, food- even the salad :) ( I think my stomach just growled.)"}
{"text":"today my wife and i went to green. and as usual it was fantastic! pizza and and an oatmeal creme cookie. it does not get much better. we are always fans and when we get up here we come on in. never have we had a bad meal (too many to list). since they made the top ten on veg news best vegan restaurants we go when we can. if you are in the hood stop on in and check it out. the staff is very friendly and are always willing to make a recomendation. the daily special is always very tasty.   we have had the soynami (peanut butter and chocolate) and it was good, but it is not the best vegan ice cream i have had. high quality for sure but a bit pricey for the taste. dont miss the cookie though, it is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"When I worked in the area I would occasionally go here for lunch.Although I do eat some vegetarian foods, have not objection to a non-vegetarian meal and was a little leary the first time I went. But for realz. Shout out to the Black Jack Pita. It's super delicious and the texture is just amazing (something that can be a fatal downfall of vegetarian foods).  One of my other favorite foods is the hummus. I like to order it and put it in my tummus....  Anyway... If you have that one vegetarian person in the office let them have this one, it won't kill you eating one meat free lunch and it is not bad food. Just don't let them pick all the time, after all, we can't let the minority over step their bounds...."}
{"text":"Not a vegan, but this place has some seriously delicious food. Try their ice cream too - so impressed every time I eat here."}
{"text":"As a meat eater was very happy with how good the food was. Was kinda thrown how close to meat the burger tasted."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago on vacation. If I remember correctly, I ordered the poboy. Messy and DELICIOUS. Definitely need to check it out again next time I'm out here."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't live 45 minutes away. I really like the Big Wac. I did not miss the meat at all. The restaurant was clean and I did not have to wait too long for my order. I plan to eat there again soon."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. The food, the staff, the next door desert place (Nami -- sister store).  Have loved every dish. The \"Crab\" Puffs are to die for.  Any of their bowls have been superb. Can't find anything not to like about this place...  They even have a way above average bathroom.... :)"}
{"text":"Ok, went and got the TSoynami blizzard... loved it!  It is made with soy so the ice cream has a little bit of a nutty flavor.  Went a safe route and got the cookies and cream made with Newman's Os.  It was delicious!  They have a whole menu (front and back) of blizzard flavors, and you can customize if you want.  Best of all, my 6 year old said it was better than Dairy Queen.  Yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Long live the big wac!!!! And the chicken nuggets, chili fries, Philly cheesesteak...*drools*  Definitely a great choice no matter your vegan, vegetarian or not."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Phoenix I have to get to this amazing vegan foodie location. The no harm chicken parm is out of this world! And for a vegan sweet I walk next door to Nami!"}
{"text":"I tried it again, trying to see if anything positive had changed in the months since I had been here last. I tried the Calexico burger. Again, terribly thin, seemingly artificially processed patties (though there was two) slathered in sauce and a bun. No texture, just a mushy mess. Three redeeming values remain: the thyme fries are amazing, they remember your name and seem to have stepped up customer service and attention, and the Tsoynamis are delicious. I'm afraid this is the last lunch I will be enjoying here unless I hear they decide to stop competing with is loosely termed \"food\" at McDonald's."}
{"text":"I have given this place MANY chances, but I have yet to find something i truly love or sits well with me.  It is quite tasty, but i feel it is all very, very oily/greasy & heavy.  The meat substitutes they use tend to give me a stomach ache.  It is unfortunate though as i know many people who rave about it and are regulars.  Will probably give it yet another shot one day - LOL.  The staff is very nice & helpful."}
{"text":"Vegans, vegetarians, gluten free, carnivore- whatever the hell you are, this place is delicious. I've been coming here for years, the owner, Damon, is such a bad ass dude, I'm still in love with his menu. The specials are so good, and dear god, do yourself a favor and get a tsoynami, with captain crunch, because I said so."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  As you may be able to tell from my other reviews, I am a beef eater. One of my vegan friends took me here on whim, so I figured I would try it and likely not like it. Boy was I wrong!!  I have had so many incredible meals here, I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this place is. How do they make beans / soy taste like the most perfect piece of chicken I have ever had - I am unsure.  The best thing I think I had had, was a special. It was mock duck done in a french style - called \"the donald.\" I am a huge duck fan - and this did not disappoint. I strongly recommend you try this place, and go back often to try new dishes. I have yet to find a dish I did not like."}
{"text":"Staff is very attentive, friendly and food is always amazing! Recommend the animal style fries, \"chicken\" burger. Don't forget to go next door to their dessert spot Nami for some tasty treats"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! At first when my friends said they wanted to go to a vegan restaurant, I was against the idea as I am a firm believer you need some type of meat with each meal.  I could not have been more wrong, everything at Green in delicious, it is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! It is a GREAT place to impress your meat-eating friends! Tell them to get the buffalo wings, buffalo chicken sandwich, or mongolian chicken bowl... those are the best dishes!"}
{"text":"I have not been here for a sometime and was quite disappointed that some of my favorite dishes were no longer offered. However, there were new offerings and we tried the vegetarian chicken sandwich and it was most delicious, quite crunchy & very tasty.  The soynami is always a plus, can never get tired of eating that.  The staff is friendly and you get your food real quick.  There's a poke gym for those playing Pokemon go..."}
{"text":"Hands down best vegan comfort food! I have a friend that was eating here for weeks because it was close to her work and she didn't even realize it was vegan until I told her. Calico burger or spicy g is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Not Vegan? Hey neither am I! However, if all Vegan food tasted like this I would never eat meat again! I got a Big Wac based on reviews, fries, side of ranch and a chocolate chip cookie. Tasted just like McDonald's minus the horrendous guilt and shame that follows about 2 minutes after you start eating. Ranch was very dill-y and garlic-y, which I loved. Cookie was crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and showing all of greens glory to my friends. Damon is a complete genius and combines casual food and a funky atmosphere in a location you would drive by everyday without realizing it.  The bowls are awesome, I love the specials with catchy names. And tsoynamis! You own my soul."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is amazing, I ordered the OG spicy hand held, chili cheese fries and the buffalo wings. Each dish was prepared nicely and served warm. The best part about Green New American Vegetarian is the \"going green\" atmosphere which is influential."}
{"text":"Hands down the best mock-chicken that I've ever had.  While it's near impossible to get the texture of chicken in a vegetarian option (and this was no exception) the flavor was spot-on.  Just delicious.  The entree I had was the Sweet and Sour \"Chicken\" with the pan fried noodles.  Service was quick (a necessity for lunch) and courteous, and the prices were very good.  I also enjoyed the iced green tea and the organic lemonade.  My colleague had a salad and he felt it had way too much dressing on it, so a word to the wise that you may want to order your dressing on the side."}
{"text":"We used to come here more frequently, thought service and quality have been getting worse. I was craving a sandwich, so stopped by. Service was slower than ever and food quality still was poor. There definitely are better vegetarian choices"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my FAVORITE vegan/vegetarian restaurants!  A dear friend treated me to lunch here and I've been coming ever since.  The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly and makes great suggestions if you can't make up your mind."}
{"text":"Update:   The temperature situation seems to have improved. I ate there the other day. Like, on site.  The best kept secret in the man-world: the women who work and dine here  are so bloody hot. If you're a straight male human, lonely, longing for the touch of a beautiful woman, eat here. Everyday. You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries.   Original review:   I love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come true. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable. All that complaining aside, I cannot recommend this place enough for the food. It's, quite frankly, delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Seriously, I crave the food regularly.  It's a bit of a drive from my house, but I don't mind because the food never disappoints!  I have only positive things to say about the food and the ataff.  The only real drawbacks for me are the parking situation (not many spots and kind of a pain to navigate when it's full), and prices.  I can't really complain because a good product and service is worth appropriate compensation (and this definitely is).  I just don't earn enough to really be a regular, if that makes sense.  Overall, I definitely recommend Green (either location), but if you come be prepared to drop a decent chunk of change, and maybe ride share if you're coming with friends"}
{"text":"This is the best vegan restaurant I've ever been to! Yummy soynami shakes, I always get the drunken mushroom and chicken bowl. I love the crispy mock chicken that seems to melt in your mouth!   I also went here for the annual vegan thanksgiving lunch, which was certainly an experience worth having at least once!"}
{"text":"Living in the Santa Cruz area, it's easy to  become accustomed to finding a variety of delicious vegetarian food. I traveled to the Phoenix area this spring for vacation and finding Green was like finding an oasis in the Arizona desert. My dining experience here was the best I had on the trip and I know if I lived in the area I'd be eating here at least once a week.   One of the things that impressed me so much was that Green makes all of their vegan mock meat and cheese goodies from scratch. The No-Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich stole the show, and was not made with your standard morningstar chik patty but rather a seitan-based lightly breaded from scratch recipe. The fake mozzarella cheese (which seemed more like ricotta) was creamy and delicious.   The vegan chili on the fries was tangy with just a little spice, and my boyfriend's Argenitine po-boy was a good take on fake steak.  The sides of tahini coleslaw and curry pasta salad were quite tasty as well. I only wish I'd had room to enjoy an oatmeal pie or a \"Tsoynami\" for dessert.   The service at Green was very friendly and it has a nice but casual artsy decor. I can't wait until my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This was a nice find on my recent business trip to Phoenix, especially since I've been searching out satisfying vegetarian fare given how I've been attempting to turn a nutritional leaf. Phoenix actually has quite a few excellent vegan and vegetarian-friendly restaurants from the original True Food Kitchen (review: http://bit.ly/2BT7Zqn) to Fresh Mint in Scottsdale (review: http://bit.ly/2Diq8m4). I can see how a healthier diet could help you cope with all the dry heat down there, and Green appears to be one of the more popular spots down there since cars were circulating the funky-retro building on a regular basis in their futile search for an open parking space.  I was lucky because I got there around 5:30PM having survived not only the rush hour traffic but also Seventh Street's infamous suicide lanes to get there. For a fully vegan menu, the selection was very home-style comfort food but obviously with a meatless twist like the use of grilled seitan for their Chicago Cheesesteak and mock chicken in their BBQ Sammie. I was immediately drawn to the $8.75 Peanut Chicken Salad since I could easily indulge myself in a bowlful of brown rice otherwise. It featured several pieces of mock chicken coated in a crispy texture, mixed greens, cabbage, carrots, green onions, and crushed peanuts.  It was all tossed in a sweet peanut vinaigrette and topped with tortilla chips I probably didn't need (photo: http://bit.ly/2EJ518M). It was quite tasty though I assume it was not as low in calories as I was hoping, especially since there was a bit of peanut sauce in the vinaigrette that bordered on decadent. It was truly entree size, but I underestimated the portion (as usual) and ordered a $3.75 bowl of Vegan Chili on the side. This was also topped with plenty of tortilla strips which made me think I ate a bag of Doritos for dinner (photo: http://bit.ly/2DCfnbv). Since a place this organic wouldn't be caught dead with Diet Coke, I took advantage of the bottomless refills of the $2.25 Strawberry Lemonade which lent puckery sweetness to my meal.  FOOD - 4 stars...tasty vegan comfort food that's quite filling AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...funky vibe, nice patio, traffic hell on Seventh to get here SERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice vegans TOTAL - 4 stars...another enticing meatless spot to check out in Phoenix"}
{"text":"A menu that offers fresh authentic vegetarian based dishes. Service was great and the food was absolutely delicious. Great tea selections too!"}
{"text":"It's a chore to find cheap veg-friendly options in the northern Tempe area and Green is usually a good choice. The staff is hit or miss..I've had experiences with some real snobs at the counter as well as some real sweeties.   As for the food...for starters, I've had the spring rolls which are greasy but ok, the crab puffs which are ADDICTIVE, the fake hot wings which are so similar to the real thing its a little scary. The hummus is intense, but good; however I wish the accompanying pita weren't fried. Green likes to fry.   The bowls are alright (would not recommend for takeout because they'll taste like the cardboard box) because the veggies are cooked well and the sauce flavor is good, I like the Mongolian, but I've had better tofu. The Singapore on the back of the menu is delicious.   The BEST thing on the menu is the Green Burger although I don't care much for the fries. The curry pasta salad is a good side option. mmmm the BEST Tsoynami is the Clunky Monkey- bananas, walnuts, chocolate :] If only I could get a Green burger fix past 9 pm!"}
{"text":"Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing \"soynamis\" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food."}
{"text":"The house tofu is the best tofu I've ever had! I wish I knew how to cook it myself! Get the house tofu in pretty much any of the bowls, and you're good. Also love their Big Wac for a splurge meal!"}
{"text":"Green New American Vegetarian has excellent reviews, which made me excited to try their vegan dishes. I ordered the Buffalo Wing ($5.50), Sesame Dragon Rice Bowl with mock chicken ($9.75), The BFF $8.75), and Big WAC ($8.50).   From the reading the Yelp reviews, I was most excited to try the Big WAC, but it was salty vegan patties with burnt bread. It does taste similar to a McDonald's Big Mac and like a Big Mac it was lacking. I would also skip the Buffalo Wings as well.   The two dishes I did enjoy were has mock chicken as the main protein - The BFF and rice bowl. After trying The BFF, I got one to-go for my girlfriend and she did not even know that it was fake fried chicken. I would try Green New American Vegetarian again for their other mock chicken sandwiches.  What I recommend: -- The BFF"}
{"text":"I've finally visited this place twice now after taste-testing a sample of their food many months ago. I'm not vegan/vegetarian, but this is still a great place to eat. It's a place that I will definitely visit again.  The buffalo wings are a must-have item. The spicy buffalo sauce incorporates fresh garlic and scallions and is better than I've had anywhere else. I get this appetizer every time I go. The Thyme fries are also a nice appetizer. The fries are thinly sliced, nicely spiced, and not greasy.  The dishes are quite large. I have tried the curry and kung pao entrees. Both had nice flavors, but could use more sauce and neither blew me away. The mock meats used in their dishes are very impressive, especially in terms of texture. The appetizers, for me, are large enough to be a meal. Meanwhile, the entree bowls are big enough for two people.   There is a nice collection of house drinks, including lime, lemon, vimto (red fruit drink), and green tea. You can mix and match them as you like and refills are free.  For desert, there is a collection of tsoynamis, which are a soy-based ice cream in DQ Blizzard style. I tried the betterfinger version, which was good, but extremely sweet (like eating cake frosting).   The order line gets backed up to the door, even during off-peak hours. By the way, you order at the counter here, get your own drinks and such, then pick a place to sit. The staff only deliver your food and you clean up after yourself when done. So, this is not a traditional, sit-down restaurant. The environment is very rustic/wooden and laid back. The prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The best vegan and gluten free American food around! Love their fries, chili, and Tsoynamis(aka vegan blizzard)."}
{"text":"The buffalo wings are out of this world-- they're the best buffalo wings I've ever had, meat or otherwise. The Argentine Po-Boy is also excellent. My only complaints are that the prices are a bit high ($8-$9 entrees) for what you get, and the service is a little bit lacking. I'd typically expect lower prices for what is essentially a fast food restaurant, but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I was as skeptical as most about this place. Have been eating without red meats for over a year and slowly weaning out the rest of meat products I eat. Its still hard to not eat chicken for me though, but I try!! I read a lot of reviews about this place before heading in. I was scared. I am open minded, but really, this big WAC takes just like a big MAC?!! Didn't believe it. My sister and I went for lunch on day and I ordered one. I was nervous waiting for it because I was hungry and this was my lunch break. I did not want to get something disgusting! It arrived and look very good. In fact it was just as good tasting. I was shocked and thought to myself how I have to bring my family in here now. They wont believe me unless they try it. My sister ordered a sandwich and ate the whole thing. NEVER eats a whole sandwich. I know its difficult to try new things, but this place is worth it. On a negative note we ordered the wantons...gross. Smelled gross and tasted worse. Others may like, but we did not. Go try this place out if your looking to eat healthy."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!    The BIG WAC is amazing. I had the Big Wac and the animal fries, and seriously, I was in heaven. If you told me i was eating a real Big Mac, I would believe you. I would never know it's not meat. This place needs to be all over America, save the animals. No need to eat meat when there is food like this that is healthier and more compassionate. I see fast food Green American everywhere.  Save the planet.  Forget meat, eat here!  You'll live longer.  I'll be back Green New American!  I swear, you are my new best friend."}
{"text":"This place alone makes me wish I lived in Phoenix.  Living in LA there are a zillion vegan restaurants, but nothing quite like this.  My husband and I spent two days in Phoenix, and ate at Green both days (actually we tried both Green locations - Phoenix and Scottsdale) and have been craving it ever since.   We tried various menu items; the spicy buffalo \"wings\", the \"no-harm parm\", \"crab puffs\", the \"green burger\" and the \"coconut curry bowl\" - each was AWESOME! We also had to splurge and eat lots of 'nami soy soft-serve ice cream! OMG!   Thinking I might drive to Phoenix this weekend, just to eat at Green!"}
{"text":"I'm from Boston & found this place when in Tempe...I'm in love!! The food is AMAZING. I've seriously considered vacationing in Arizona just so I can go back to this place (I'm not kidding). Even better they could open one in Boston!!"}
{"text":"Great concept! Burgers, eggrolls, chicken wings, mock duck, thyme fries, cream puffs.   Only thing - my friend paid for a sangria. NEVER got it. So she went and repaid. 20 minutes later, I had to go to the counter and asked for it because she still did not receive her sangria."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much more than I actually did. I've gone to Green on several occasions and have tried something different every time (in hopes that I'll actually find something I truly like).   Nope. Didn't really happen, unfortunately, which makes me so so sad.  Pros:  Major props to the designer/decorator. I do like the concept of the place--most of the decorations/furniture seemed to be refurbished or recycled items. Can't complain about how creative and \"green\" the place is! Also, I like their concept of the tSoynami (soy-based ice-cream sundae mixed in with all sorts of candies/cereals/syrups/etc. of your choice. There's a million different pre-made combos you can choose from, but I'm sure you can customize your own as well.   Cons:  I'm just really underwhelmed with the main entrees and dishes. Perhaps I went in with too high of expectations? Out of the Bowls section of the menu, I've tried Singapore Orange, Thai Peaunut, and Drunken Mongolian. Honestly, I thought they all tasted the same. The flavors were heavily soy-sauce based (which is fine...I grew up eating lots of soy-sauce based dishes), but I really couldn't tell the difference between the three. I've also tried the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, the Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy and the Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\" form the menu as well. These were decent, but were super super high-in-sodium-tasting if you know what I mean.  Granted, I'm also a fan of meat, so vegetarian shops like Green may not be my greatest area of expertise. My comments, truly,  are more targeted towards the flavor combos and balances of the dishes here.   Overall, I like the concept of Green. If a vegetarian/vegan friend was in town for a week, I would probably bring him/her to Green to check the place out. Personally, though, I'm not sure I would crave Green enough to visit again on my own."}
{"text":"So good! Love the vibe of the place, food choices were awesome. I love that it is all vegan and tastes great. We got the bff which was an imitation chicken sandwich that was so similar to chicken I could hardly tell with a great sauce and spicy roasted jalapeños on it. We also got a Brussel sprout salad which had a great dressing flavor as well. Not even that expensive either, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We try to stop by this place whenever we are in the area; however, the parking is so sparse, that it is often a challenge to find ANY space. Sometimes, we have to park at nearby business just to get in here. So, be forewarned, you may have to squeeze into a narrow parking lot to get in.  However, when you do manage to get in here, you will be well pleased with the menu. Some dishes are fairly original, and some are variations on a standard. But, so far, we haven't really been disappointed with anything that we have tried.  For starters, we often order the spicy buffalo wings (wings? I thought this was a vegan/vegetarian place), or the green hummus. Both are delicious.  For the entrees, the spicy peanut chicken salad, or the Big WAC are some of their standard and well executed.  For drinks, and this is probably one of the plusses of coming here, the Vimto juice is just such a wonderful departure from the ordinary. It's a combination of grapes, raspberries, and black currants and is wonderfully mild on the pallete. Normally, each one of these fruits can be quite overwhelming by themselves, but in this iteration @ Greens, it is quite a mild and satisfying combination.  And the service is friendly and efficient. It's not a very big place, and it is easy to miss down 7th street, but it is worth stopping by if you are in the area and want to try something different."}
{"text":"Great place for really good vegan/vegetarian options! They have soy free options too which is really nice. Definitely returning soon."}
{"text":"I found them on yelp and decided to give them a try. The best decision I made. This is my only 2nd vegetarian restaurant I've ever tried and for now Mew Green American Vegetarian is my #1 go to stop when I want a burger. Omg their famous Big Wac burger is the best vegan burger I have tasted so far and it is well worth penny. I order the famous Big Wac and Buffalo wings. I had to bring the wings home because I was full of the Big Wac alone and the 2 cups of raspberry lemonade I had which by the way was delicious as well. Don't take my word go check them out yourself I promise your tummy will thank you and you will be thanking me for this review lol. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just found this place today and couldn't be happier!  Got the BFF, Peanut salad, and fried Brussels sprouts.  Yum yum yum.  Placed the order to go and picked it up in ten minutes.  The place is warm and inviting, staff was friendly, prices were great and the food was fantastic.  What more could you want?  Highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"indifferent service, mediocre food and way to salty, wont be back"}
{"text":"Came from out of town and had to try this place because of all the good reviews and I must say almost everything my friends and I tried were pretty good. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries which was really good, the Big Mac was pretty good as well, tacos were good, wasn't a fan of the hot wings. All in all really good but very long lines"}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup while understand being busy your online ordering system told me a time which should account for the \"busyness\". I left came back and was told it would be another 15-30 minutes. Really?  Plus the person was a bit snippy about it. Parking was extremely limited and difficult and there is not a place to wait except your vehicle."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the best Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants I have been to in a while! Their mock meats are seasoned so well and the food is really healthy you feel good leaving there! Appetizer: Chili Fries...Yum! Entree: Kung Pao Chicken...Yummier! Dessert: Tsoynami with bananas, peanut butter, mallow...Yummiest!!!!! So good you must go!"}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant as I type this review.  Green has been one of my favorite restaurants since they opened a few yrs ago. I'm not vegan nor vegetarian and everything I've ordered has been delicious.   The restaurant is constantly working to improve itself and each time I go my experience is better than the prior. The Tempe/ South Scottsdale location recently updated their menus (one week ago), while keeping some favorites from the old menus, and I was a little apprehensive. I was recommended the Karma Curry. The dish is fantastic, as expected. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other newly added dishes. If you're looking for something light yet fulfilling give Green a shot, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times, and the food is great, but the recent menu change and price increase across the board puts this regular spot out of my budget. The Po-Boys and burgers no longer come with sides, so I'm expected to pay nearly $4 on top of the $9 burger to get a decent meal in, not including a beverage. It's borderline outrageous.  Green was my gateway, and go-to, into vegan food, but now that it's charging Scottsdale+ prices, I know I won't be able to frequent this favorite spot of mine as frequently as I desire."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and a particularly awesome place to eat if you are vegan/vegetarian. A diverse menu with items to please any appetite, including some of the best mock meat dishes around. Order the Big Wac, its better than the original. Parking and seating is tight during peak times, but it's worth the wait. Follow up with a delicious Tsoynami - a vegan blended ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some grub before we caught some bands across the street.....very cool little vegan place. I had a vegan big mac (looked just like the real thing) and some meatless chicken wings!  Not my normal way of eating, but it was great!! Pretty Hipster vegan place, I liked it a lot!!"}
{"text":"The foods are kept simple there, the buffalo wings are great.  The first thing that came in my mind was \"wow i can't believe this is not meat\".  saw them at Devour too.  Amazing restaurant, im so glad we finally have an amazing vegan restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"I live down the street and can walk my dog here, grab coffee and chill on the patio. It's really the best place for a vegan or gluten free option in Coronado. Super chill with coffee and sweet treats at Nami right next door...  Pro hack: The Hummas app, Big Wac and Thai bowl make even the hangriest kids come back from the dark side."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but I might become one based on this place. Everything I have had so far has been spectacular. I never once asked where was the meat. I have gone a couple of times but I do have plans to return with some meat lovers to get their take."}
{"text":"Trendy, hip, but completely vegan.  Some vegetarian places have healthy dishes alongside for the carnivores in the group. Not this place. Plenty of imitation meat dishes just totally vegan."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. Only downsides are 1) it's sometimes very busy on weekends around lunch time, 2) they don't serve alcohol. The Tsoynamis are to die for but you have to be willing to do a calorie splurge or at least split one with someone as they are huge."}
{"text":"pretty meh. on the way out of town, my friends and i came here to trick ourselves into feeling healthy. i think it's worth trying, but not remarkable in any way.  i got to try the coconut curry,  bbbq burger, thyme fries, crab puffs, and berry lemonade. the curry was super bland. i got it without a protein since i just and it was like something i'd make at home and eat begrudgingly. the bbbq burger was okay, and the fries sounded like they'd be really good, but were just pretty normal.  the crab puffs were the best! as good as everyone said. they were garlicky and hot and creamy. i was very surprised they were vegan. their drinks, berry lemonade, and limeade were both really really good and not too sweet. definitely get one if you're here.  the atmosphere was decent, cafe style with a few booths. the people working were nice enough, though i think the girl i got was new because i don't think she understood the menu exactly. this would be a cool option to try, but i probably wouldn't come back if i were back in the part of the world."}
{"text":"I am still a big fan, Another good rice bowl, and a po-boy this time.  It was the firs time I ever ventured to the sandwich side of the menu wand I was pleased.  We had a Argentinean po boy which was basically mock steak peppers and onions. The mock beef as great,  the veggies were a bit over cooked and the bun was toasted but nothing special for $8.  We did start with the egg rolls, aside from the small noodles inside they were decent as they were fried but not greasy but again nothing special. $4  We also split a \"diablo red\" bowl $7.50 despite the name we had to add some hot sauce to up the level of diablo to it. The veggies were fresh and well cooked, the mock chicken was great and the brown rice served it's purpose well.    Overall I like the format of this place, and the fact I can order anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Best food ever. I go a few times a week. Love the salads and bowls. The service is fun!!! Great people and excellent food. For a joke I bring people from work and don't tell them. They can't even tell the difference between real meat and the mock meat. It's awesome! My fav place in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! One of the very best vegan restaurants I've ever been to. Rivals Gobo and Blossom in NYC. This put Phoenix on the map for me as a place that veggies can live!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best. You must have the Dagoba Jungle. Shown here with a side of slaw. GF and SF. AHmazing!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is my 3rd time trying to post a review, and each time it has been erased when I go to press submit....  I came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and was VERY disappointed. The food was awful. I am not vegetarian nor vegan so I am not knowledgeable in appreciating good mock meat, but I CAN differentiate between tasty and unappetizing.  Artichoke Dip was watery and looked like light grey/brown colored gunk.  I got the Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl with tofu and was only able to take a couple bites because it really tasted awful. I typically really like eating tofu too. Please believe me in that I am not a picky eater and it is very rare for me to dislike a restaurant meal.  My boyfriend got a mock beef dish that had this underlying soy flavor. One plus about both our entrees was the amount of veggies in our dishes, but we couldn't even pick out the vegetables because of that strong background taste that lingered on our tongues."}
{"text":"I still want to live here.  It's quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home.      I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:    Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.    Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color)."}
{"text":"So keep in mind I am not a vegan or vegetarian.  I was brought here by a vegan coworker and I am wiling to try everything once.  I give it 4/5 because I am not a vegan & some of the food was pretty good.  Some of it for a NONVEGAN was just unedible.  However, the soynamis (sp?) are so so so GOOD!  I do come back for them!  That atmosphere was great & the people were friendly.  Green is not cheap though."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this place :) If you're looking for a great small, quaint place to have vegetarian food TRY IT!!! Their Ice Cream is Delicious, the staff's fantastic and the food is yummy. Healthy :)"}
{"text":"Delicious... I really love their wings, chicken nugs, cheesesteak, fries and their peanut chicken as a burrito does not disappoint. Try their bowls as well those are so darn good. This placs is LEGIT!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the shwarma chicken gyro with the curry pasta salad. It was delicious! Friendly staff, free WiFi, clean facility/restrooms, good price...what more could you ask for!  If you are the kind of person who puts ranch dressing on everything they eat, this probably isn't your place - I'm sure you will find a fast food place down the road where your mac-rib sandwich was mass produced out of a stamp machine."}
{"text":"One word Amazing. Everything a former meat eater would love. \"Buffalo Wings\", burgers and cheesey animal fries. Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I've found my new go to place!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place! I am not a Vegetarian and I always get a little wary about places that are solely vegetarian, but I had looked at the Yelp reviews on this place, and it was within walking distance of my hotel, so I decided to give it a try.  I was definitely not disappointed. The place is very welcoming in an ethereal sort of way. It is a mostly college crowd predictably but there were other in the restaurant as well. I spoke with the young lady (her name escapes me now) at the counter who was very friendly and knowledgeable. I told her truthfully that I was not a vegetarian and did she have any suggestions. At her direction, I tried the crab puffs and the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken. I walked it back to my hotel.  All I can say is.....WOW! The mock chicken tasted like..... well,..... CHICKEN! Great chicken actually. I don't really go for straight tofu and the vegetarian god who prepared this must have known it. I did not miss the chicken. The Thai peanut bowl was quite spicy and delicious. The crab puffs were very good, a little greasy, and not as good as the real thing, but well worth it, and if I am here again I will probably have them again. Way to go! If many vegetarian restaurants are this good, then Jeff might have to rethink his avoidance of these places."}
{"text":"A definite must for vegan eats. Their BBQ \"chicken\" wings are yummy. Hubby liked his Thai peanut bowl with brown rice. Garlic hummus was VERY garlicky. I wouldn't order it again probably. But we will be back!"}
{"text":"For all you junk food vegans- this is your treat! This place has animal style fries, GUYS!!! So many other great things on the menu you don't usually get to indulge in! If being a fatty isn't your style they've got some healthy options, too. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Loved the selection, the prices and the decor! The vibe and staff are pretty cool too  Cant say enough about it except i wish we had this franchise in florida"}
{"text":"This is a great place! I am in Tempe for a week on business and was referred here by friends (and saw the great Yelp reviews, too); rode my bike 3.5 miles to get here...      The first thing you see is the cool, quasi-hippie decor (awesome!); the menu has a great variety from Asian to burgers to Italian... I had the Kung Pao with mock chicken; it was spiced very nicely and the \"chicken\" tasted quite good! I am not a vegetarian, and even I was impressed! :) I had the Coco Loco Tsoynami for dessert and it was *amazing!* creamy like ice cream, but not quite as filling.      I will definitely come here again on my next visit to Tempe!"}
{"text":"Im not a vegetarian bc i love to eat meat but i also try to eat healthy. In my opinion this place satisfies my taste for burgers and such without feeling bad about it. This is a win win. Great tasting food, good prices and quick service."}
{"text":"I am a new vegan but have had the opportunity to eat vegan in several cities through 3 different states now and the meal here was by far the worst I've had. The \"fresh\" tofu was rubbery, vegetables undercooked, the sauce watery, and rice nondescript...very bland and not tasty compared to every other place I've tried."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and I am always satisfied! Just pure vegan decadence."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, or that everything on the menu is vegan, this is not the place for anyone on a diet or \"watching what they eat\". The food is delicious comfort food with lots of fried things, in large portions, and I love it! Sure there are some things like salads, and rice bowls, if you need to go the healthier route, but no matter what you should be washing it all down with a creamy sinful Soynami. As soon as Green gets their liquor license it will be a 5 star rating for sure."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Green before, went with a friend on a Monday night, the place was hoppin', the food was amazing (though I recognize the trick of providing a huge bowl to make the portion size look bigger than it really is, but that's a logistics issue and doesn't detract too much from the overall experience) the service was pleasant and efficient, and I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu.  I had the thai peanut bowl w/ sprouted tofu for my first outing, and I was not unhappy about it AT ALL.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad at green and that includes both phoenix valley locations and trying tsoynami treats (think vegan blizzard) as well. Go give it a shot.   Go up to the front of the line to grab a menu and then take it all in, when it's time to order try anything that sounds tasty. My favorites are the buffalo wings (deliciously spicy sauce) and their bowls are very good also.   I've brought a lot of non-veg friends here and they have made the decision to come back on their own without me. So you should get to any green location as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Phoenix location - My husband and I LOVE this place! The food is fantastic. Prices are great and the folks running it are always so nice. It's our favorite spot to go in the city."}
{"text":"A hidden Tempe gem has opened up a store in cen Pho, and changed my lunch time landscape.  The menu is the same, with sandwiches, salads, bowls and burgers. Prices are $7-9 for most items, a bit steep for the amount of food.  The ambiance is contemporary with a minimalist eccentric interior and staff to with the piercings to match.   My thai peanut bowl was good, the mock meat has a great texture, the sauce was strong but not overpowering and the noodles were cooked well.  We also had the Mexican burger that was great other than that the bun was a bit too large for the patty."}
{"text":"Best tofu ever ! Had a wonderful flavor from the minced veggies mixed inside of it.  Awesome drink selection - good prices - cute atmosphere - can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"5 stars! I love this place. The soynamis are excellent. The chicken nuggets are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I love this place but we ate here yesterday and it was not up to par at all!!!   My bowl (Mongolian) was lacking noodles and the vegetables were cut SO BIG I could not eat them. It's hard to eat a bowl with the veggies are cut as big or bigger than my fork. I had to cut them or bit them in half which makes for a difficult bowl eating experience! My wife had the same thing but with brown rice, brown rice under cooked and crunchy. The flavor was lacking and so was the sauce. It was too garlicky as well. I love garlic but I cannot stand when places go garlic mad on everything. I want subtle garlic as I would like to taste other flavors. We have been eating here for years but I feel this location at least is loosing it's focus. We will give it another shot and if it's the same, we will move on. I do prefer the 7th St location better in all reality because tempe is to wannabe for me but I think I am going to take my Vegan business elsewhere! I think this place has become extremely overrated and quality, flavor have gone downhill while the price stays the same or higher than before. I cannot justify eating here any longer as I know there are better Vegan joints out there. Over it!"}
{"text":"Amazing new American vegan cuisine!! The food is excellent! Service is fairly quick. You won't be disappointed. I would give 5 stars however parking is horrible. This won't stop me from coming back! Try the Singapore orange with mock chicken. I get mine extra spicy. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Green you let me down! Your coconut curry was so plain and flavorless!! Of course my soynami was great and the wings are flavorful but stay away from the curry! I tried putting siracha and the ranch sauce for the wings on the curry but it was still so plain. I really should've given the dish back. It was hard to eat it was so bland. This 2 star is truly only for the coconut curry. Really, really disappointing."}
{"text":"While I generally shy away from \"pretend meats and dairy,\" I have to hand it to Green for doing both exceptionally well.  Everything tastes fresh, flavorful, and generally amazing, and every non-vegetarian I have taken to this restaurant has been blown away!  I especially love the \"moo-shroom po-boy,\" which is a vegan version of a pulled-pork sandwich, made with an espresso barbecue sauce and bell peppers.  It's extraordinarily messy, but even more delicious.  Their artichoke dip is also great, and does very well in the fridge; I think it might have been better the next day.  Just keep in mind that the place is usually crowded, so if you are going with a group, avoid peak hours!"}
{"text":"Tasty and healthy thai vegetarian bowl. Grader mix of vegetables, tofu and noodles. Friendly service.  Had a great mix of people dinning there- families to monks! Would go back, if i was living around here."}
{"text":"I never thought that 'vegetarian' could taste so good!! Everything on the menu is dairy free according to the cashier, and there is a separate menu for gluten free foods.   I got the coconut curry with fake chicken meat - I could have been fooled it was the real thing. My friend got the coconut curry with tofu, which had so much flavor. The curry bowl came with brown rice hidden under a pile of healthy and crunchy steamed veggies, all smothered in a flavorful yet slightly spicy sauce. The only factor was that the curry didn't have much of a coconut flavor, but it was still really delicious.   I have absolutely no concerns about the ingredients that are used- as far as I know, Green is very transparent about their foods. Definitely the place to go to for people wanting healthier choices other than salad. I would recommend trying this place, even if you're not vegetarian. You would be surprised!"}
{"text":"I ordered their thai peanut bowl with noodle and house tofu. Tofu to me doesn't taste like tofu and I've had many tofu being that my mom cook vegetarian dish a lot. The house tofu seem like fake tofu is that's a good description. The brocoli was not cook fully and hard to chew.  Overall, it's a small place at 7th street/mcdowell so parking is small but the service was very good. A good place to hang out. maybe next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been coming here regularly for the last few months. Even though I am not a vegan/vegetarian anymore, I still love the food. I usually order the Mongolian with crispy tofu and brown rice, but have also had a couple of other menu items that have all been good. Their french fries are TO DIE FOR. Seriously... it's the kind of thing you have sexy food dreams about.  The staff are always pleasant and helpful, and the space is always clean and welcoming. I will continue to come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Well, I fell into the classic trap. Let me warn you:  VEGAN DOES NOT MEAN HEALTHY  Sure, a vegan diet can be healthier than a meat diet, depending on whose advice you're following. Fried starches are vegan, sugar is vegan, overly- processed chemical meat substitutes are vegan... you get the idea.  That being said, this place is tasty. They offer a substantial and varied menu to appeal to the masses while maintaining a no-harm attitude. Even the to-go containers are eco-friendly. I had the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. I don't usually go for the fake n' bake, but I was persuaded. This was convincing, but I would probably go for the tofu next tme. The sauce was delicious and the dish was satisfying, the veggie to chicken ratio was impressive (lots of both). Hubsky ordered thee Argentine po-boy, a fake steak sandwich with caremelized peppers and onions with vegan mayo and chimichuri sauce. He found that satidfying. I tasted it for reviewing purposes, and I have to say that it was spicy and tasty, but again, I prefer tofu or veggies to fake meat. They did a great job of approximating the texture of steak with the seitan, but the immitation was of a fattier cut of steak. I would have preferred a chewier texture \"well-done\" texture. I packed up half my dish to leave room for the much touted Tsoynami. It lived up to its reputation. The varieties available can be overwhelming. I had a Newman's Own chocolate mint thing, but I would probably go for something completely chocolate next time. The mint was too sweet for me. It should also be noted that there were oatmeal cream cookie sandwiches that I did not try but have been thinking about since my visit... three weeks ago."}
{"text":"This restaurant is inspirational!  Read on for details...  It is a tiny little place which does a great job of circling people through.  You walk in and up to the counter where you order from the overwhelming menu!  The menu is adorned with specialties and allows for much personalization in most dishes.    I do recommend starting with their famous wings!  They are quite spicy but the sauce is exquisite.  The crab rangoons are also a nice, refreshing twist on the Chinese deep-fried goodness... these appear to be baked and come with a really light dipping sauce which packs a bunch of flavor.  For the main courses, the menu is overwhelming!  I have tried the buffalo chicken sandwich which is their same spicy-amazingness sauce in the wing appetizer and comes on a submarine roll (which is a little too large for my fancy but filling all the same- I just opted to pull one half off of it).  I have also opted for something named with diablo in it-you can order it with rice or noodles (i opted noodles) and you can pick your choice of meats to add in.  This dish was swamped with veggies!  The flavor was an explosion!   If you made it through the first part of the review, please note that everything I have talked about is completely vegan/vegetarian!  That's right... everything is made of textured soy and mushroom to create a meat-like product for the dishes.  I have even \"tricked\" people into eating this food without them even knowing they are eating meat substitutes.  That's right!  Full-on meat eaters who would never order a dish at this joint were raving about the tastiness of their meals!  If you order to go, you are given wooden utensils and smart packaging... which I love.  portions are generous and you won't leave hungry...  I would even venture to say that an appetizer and meal by your lonesome is too much food!  You must be with others to indulge in both courses (unless you want left overs).  I am slowly making my way through everything on this menu.  I eat here for every single meal I possibly can when I work in Phoenix (almost weekly) so I will update once I have conquered.  See my review for Nami, it's sister restaurant in the same parking lot... I am in the LOVE!"}
{"text":"I have been dining here for YEARS. I think my first visit was back in 2011. My husband and I still frequent here when we can. We now live near Apache Junction so it is quite the drive to make it to either Tempe or Phoenix Green.  I do want to give feedback on the new menu. There have been some recent changes and I have to say I am so happy with them. Before, you were able to get a side, like fries or cole slaw with a burger. This is fine, but sometimes we didnt want those sides. Sides are now ala carte and I love this option! Before we would only get wings, our two sandwiches with the fries. NOW we are able to get wings, another side, and our sadnwiches. I like that there are more options now. I am also incredibly happy with the new patty change. I always liked wendy's pickle but I opted for otherwise because of the \"chicken tender\" type patty. The new one is way better, easier to eat, and all around tasty.  I would love to see the Raspberry Beret permanently on the menu. We love it.   Keep doing your thing, Damon!"}
{"text":"I have frequented both the Scottsdale road and Phoenix location. From my husband and I's first visit, we fell in love.   The Wings are incredible! Texture, flavor, everything! The portion is somewhat smaller than it was a few years ago, however.  I always get the Original G spicy po boy with fries. Its like a Hot N Spicy chicken, and it is delicious! I've had the other dishes as well (we are regulars) but this is my favorite. They always have fun specials, they post them on their website! The only issue is they don't always say how long they will have it :/   They serve a sunday brunch, which is awesome. Always something new. They have breakfast other days during the week on a regular menu basis.  Oh, and this is great for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike."}
{"text":"This is the joint to hit if you're veggy or vegan.  The Faux meat is good, and they have a wide selection of faux dishes.  Oh did I mention the vegan crab puffs... they are amazing.  It's worth stopping in for an order of these alone."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by their food.  I've never been a huge \"vegetarian\" but I could eat here ever week.  The food is excellent, service is always polite, and courteous."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, always a great experience! Food is always very good, I wish they'd offer rabbit style burgers instead of bread (bun).  fries and garlic ranch is incredibly satisfying"}
{"text":"Love their rice bowls! There's always a line when I go but the staff is always quick to accommodate :) Great hard ciders as well."}
{"text":"I am a total carnivore, but I have dated around 6 vegans ...so needless to say I have been forced to eat a lot of food I wouldn't choose if I was eating by myself.  Let's face it...most vegan food sucks. It's plain, it looks unappetizing, and the fake meat tastes like chewy pieces of unflavored cardboard.   This isn't the case with the food at Green. It is DELICIOUS. A million different options all waiting to explode your taste buds.  I personally crave the Thai peanut bowl and Buffalo chicken wings on a weekly basis. The BBQ chicken sand which is amazing too. Don't under estimate this place. It wouldn't be as busy as it is, or stay open as long in AZ if it wasn't so incredibly yummy."}
{"text":"This is my go-to, guilty pleasure, Vegan spot! I've tried just about everything on their menu and have yet to be disappointed. Went with my husband again last night and were impressed yet again. Friendly staff, plenty of seating and definitely worth pushing through their tight parking situation. Definitely give this place a try, even if you're not vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian for over 10 years, I have pretty high expectations for restaurants that play the vegetarian/vegan card. I had the spicy chick'n po-boy and the sandwich was only mediocre; I wouldn't order it again. The best part of my meal was the tahini coleslaw. My lunch data had the coconut curry and she thought it was OK. The noodles and veggies were cooked well, however the flavor definitely felt like a little amateur. I won't go back. Many of the patrons had deserts so maybe that is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place was popping but the wait wasn't bad at all.  Food came out quickly even with special requests.  We ordered wings, fries and 2 sandwiches.  According to my non vegetarian partner they were right on the money.   Alley loved no one was snacking on her animal friends and everyone there was super friendly.  She especially loved that vegan water straight from the cup.  Alley just couldn't get enough cup...her nose was already inside.  I think there is something special about the vegan plastic cup because she refused to use her bowl even when the water was poured from the cup.   Stop by Green for their excellent vegan items and their pupnip ingrained plastic cup.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Meh. TINIEST portions ever! I paid $3 for the lamest serving of a side of fruit I have ever seen in my life. Literally, 6 bite sized pieces of fruit....for three dollars. Same with all the other sides.   If you are a vegetarian for health reasons, don't even think about this place. The only items that are remotely healthy are 2 of the salads, both of which don't have mock meats (which are all deep fried BTW). But, why go out for that when you can make it at home?   The burgers are mushy. The \"no harm chicken parm\" was seriously barely any mock meat-mostly fried breading with oily vegan cheese. Again, good if you don't care about health but..... seriously? Blech. I'm a steak fry kinda girl, so their fries blow IMO.  The tahini coleslaw, however, is fantastic. I could eat buckets of it but it's a \"side\", so for $3, you get a measly serving of cabbage. Lame.   Dessert sizes (which exception of tsoynamis) are pathetic. $3 for that tiny peanut butter bar? Again, lame LOL.   Since it's really the only 100% vegan in the east valley it is passable, but it is *NOTHING* compared to places in SoCal or New York or Portland."}
{"text":"I used to love their Mexicali burger, but the new menu replaced it with a lesser burger. I haven't been back since. I sincerely hope the Mexicali burger makes a comeback."}
{"text":"My entire family loves Green and we visit often. It's where we go for yummy comfort food and a delicious sweet treat. The Tsoynamis are off the hook. I personally love the rice bowls, but my kids always go for the Big Wac. Love their selection of beer and wine too. Also the employees are super friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. My husband and I moved to Brooklyn a few years ago but every time we come home we make it a point to go to this place at LEAST twice. This last trip we went four times. The Wendy's pickle is my favorite. Looking forward to my next trip back! (:"}
{"text":"They jacked the price, so fries are no longer included.  I mean... it adds like $3 per order, which is kind of bullshit.  A Big Wac, effectively a Big Mac, with fries, is like $12-something now, without even getting a drink.  That's.... it's a bit much, right?  Is it just me?"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and food is great. Most of it would be what I consider \"comfort food\". Probably not the healthiest but damn good."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian, but I'm trying to lead a healthier lifestyle, so sometimes I check out vegan and vegetarian joints like this. I had the Wendy's Pickle Sandwich, Chicago Cheesesteak, and Animal Fries  The Wendy's Pickle is a mock Buffalo chicken chicken sandwich on a Ciabatta roll, and it's actually pretty decent. You can tell it's not real chicken, but the flavor it has is good on its own. The reason it's called the Wendy's \"Pickle\" is because it's loaded with pickles...I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was happily content.  My daughter had the Chicago Cheesteak and I found myself wishing I ordered it, because it was pretty tasty. It consists of mock steak filled with onions and peppers, the only thing it was missing is mushrooms...that would have sealed the deal, but it was good nonetheless.  My granddaugther had the Animal fries, which is a vegan version of the In & Out classic, it had vegan cheese, onions and Thousand Island sauce, and it was addicting.  I washed the meal down with a classic Margarita which was above average, the restaurant was a mix of hipster and grunge, and the staff was attentive - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The buffalo wings were awesome. Glad I stopped while I was in town! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I loved this veggie place.  I was in Scottsdale for my college graduation and looked for a great veggie place.  I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Just passing thru, I didn't expect to find much in the area like it. All vegan. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The menu being American fusion is really diverse. I ordered the Red Diablo (with mock chicken) which was a pretty impressive asian stir-fry brown rice bowl. All the veggies were cooked perfectly as was the brown rice in a tasty sweet spicy sauce. Other options ranged from pizza to almost any typical sports bar styled sandwich such as Buffalo chicken or 'pulled' portobello mushroom. Pricing is fair; $7-8 for most main dishes. Check out Nomi next door for coffee, tea and plenty of vegan deserts, too."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Was so excited to find an all veggie friendly place only to be greeted by a long line, unfriendly cashier, and unhealthy food options. You would think with being all vegan they would have something that wasn't cooked in oil outside of the salad. The cashier said she would have them cook it with no oil. I take a bite only to have oily sauce come pouring out the backside. If this was a no oil sandwich I would hate to see what a normal one looked like. Regardless I don't think they actually were concerned with my issues eating oils and could have just made it like normal. I got the chili as a side. It was awful!! It tasted like meatless crumbles with taco seasoning on them. I took two bites and left it.  My boyfriend got their burger which was pretty good (I snuck a bite) with thyme fries which had no seasoned taste whatsoever. Very bland!!!  For a $30 lunch I am beyond disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my \"you must try this\" restaurant recommendations for any vegetarian/gluten-free or generally open-minded eaters. My girlfriend and I either eat here or get carry out from here on a regular basis.  Our favorites include the thai peanut & drunken mushroom bowls, the jerk tofu salad, and the \"chicken\" wings. Everything is good here though, and I mean everything - I haven't ordered something I haven't liked, although some dishes I do enjoy more than others."}
{"text":"I'm not from Arizona, but I had a few hours to kill before a flight and decided to explore beyond downtown Phoenix for dinner. Yelped \"vegetarian\" and saw this place, whose menu was reminiscent of one my favorite spots back home in NYC, Red Bamboo.  This is veggie-friendly reimaginings of classic American comfort food. Po Boys. Egg rolls. Buffalo \"wings.\" Some asian fusion-style bowls as well.  The food was excellent. Service was quick - and very friendly (being a NY-er, I was a little overly conscious about taking up too much of the server's time, but they loved chatting!).   EXCELLENT beer selection and wine on tap!  And it was CHEAP, given the quality of the ingredients and portions. Since I knew I wouldn't be back soon, I wanted to sample a lot and the cashier warned me that I was ordering way too much food for one person (I did), but I went ahead and the bill was less $25 including a glass of wine.   Really awesome, forward-thinking place. Made me reconsider my evaluation of Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale after a week there. Glad to see this kind of spot in Arizona and I hope it does gangbusters and inspires other similarly-minded businesses (I think it will - I was especially encouraged by the diversity of customers. Old war vets you'd expect to sneer at some fancy-pants non-meat, hearty salt-of-the-earth families, etc. Definitely not what you'd expect at a very urban-hip type place!)  I then went to their sister vegan ice cream/coffee shop, Nami, which was excellent and I will review later."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while and was finally in the area for lunch.  Had the \"no harm parm\" chicken sandwich.  Was super tasty except I discovered I'm not a fan of mock cheese.  I love me some mock chicken, but apparently not mock mozzarella.  Had the thyme fries as my side and they were awesome, and I'm usually not a lover of shoestring fries.  Warning though, they were very garlicky so had to do double duty on the mints after wards since I was meeting clients.  Looking forward to going back to try the mushroom \"chicken\" drunken noodles!  Yum!"}
{"text":"My second time at Green (the first time at their Scottsdale location).  I tried the Diablo bowl with crispy tofu and noodles.  Great flavor and LOTS of tasty veggies (eggplant, broccoli, peppers, onions, carrots, zucchini) but lacking in noodles.  Still left full and satisfied though.    Was disappointed that they only have bottled teas/juices and no soda (Scottsdale location has a soda fountain).  I'm not even that big on soda, but I have one Diet Coke with my lunch each day so if it's not available - or heaven forbid, Pepsi products only - then I get disappointed.  Overall, a tasty meal, and I look forward to trying other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Will be nice if they gave info on what is gluten free on the menu other than that tasty vegan comfort food."}
{"text":"True, I've had more adventurous plant-based, vegan food in a lot of cities (LA, Portland, Seattle, for example), but I think Green does a really nice job with quality, service, and an affordable, approachable menu. I am so grateful to have an option like this in a food scene dominated by steaks, pizza, and pasta.   We've been twice so far, and both times got the bowls with house tofu, brown rice, and lots of veggies. They come with various sauces and spices, and all we've tried have been excellent. The salad we ordered the first time was a touch too astringent (over-salted, too much vinegar) but otherwise included a solid variety of diverse vegetables. We tried the vegan chili fries the second time, which were pretty tasty, though I generally find that vegan food trying to imitate non-vegan food comes up a little short. We also tried the chocolate tSoynami, which was basically a non-dairy chocolate shake. I'd be interested to see the grams of sugar, but taste and texture were good.   Overall, I'd love to see a few more options on the menu where plants get to be the stars, but I enjoy Green and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is too damn delicious. No animals harmed, healthy, and better for the environment!? It's incredible, I had the Thai Curry rice bowl today. I've tried almost all of the rice bowls, they're all great, but the Thai Curry is magic.  It's crazy how much better I feel after eating and knowing that I'm not contributing to global warming (via animal agriculture) and animal cruelty. I wish more Americans were aware of factory farms and how detrimental they are to the environment."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the Bigwac,  on the top 5 of veg burgers I've had. Husband had the veg chicken wings and a rice bowl, both were good. When you enter goto the back get your menu, it is seat yourself. When you know what you want, go back up there to order."}
{"text":"In my previous visit I would have given the place of four star rating, but this time around I thought it was just okay. I got a rice bowl with mock chicken and I did not find it all that flavorful or pleasing.  As was the case previously, the people were very nice and accommodating, and the place was absolutely packed."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant chain, although the first visit was in Tempe, not Phoenix. I liked the peanut stir-fry with mock chicken so much in Tempe, I ordered it again at the downtown Phoenix location.  Unfortunately, this version of the dish was drowned in so much peanut sauce, that its all I could taste.  The veggies and mock chicken were cooked right, it was just that the dish was out of balance with too much of a powerful ingredient."}
{"text":"First vegan place I've found in the area, and this was suggested to by a friend who's been a vegan for quite some time, so to her, fake meat can't be compared to real meat. I however, still eat a steak every now and then, and the fake meat here is pretty good. It's more americanized vegan food, which I've usually only eaten asian vegan. I had the chicken salad with miso dressing which was really tasty and a small bowl was plenty for me. She had the mexicali burger which came with fruit and we shared chili fries. Although I find it to be slightly overpriced, it was still tasty and I will probably come back. My boyfriend likes vegan places too even though he still eats meat, so I'll see if it gets his approval as well"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! This is an awesome spot for vegetarians and people who may be thinking of going vegetarian. They prove that you can make meatless dishes tasty and that you don't have to give up your favorites (try their wings and their chili cheese fries!) We even got my carnivore of a dad to eat here and enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"Shared 2 bowls: Diablo Red and Thai Peanut. Both over brown rice, the Diablo Red with fresh tofu, the Thai Peanut with mock beef. The Thai Peanut was my favorite by far - WOW it was good.   I'm not a big fan of beef, but the mock beef was delicious. The sauce was a bit spicy, and happily not very sweet. Very, very good.  I didn't find the Diablo Red quite as appealing, but that's just a personal preference. Service was very friendly, and it took only a few minutes for our food to be delivered to our table. A very, very good meal."}
{"text":"I visited the greater Phoenix metropolitan area for the first time three years ago, and ended up getting lunch and dinner here in the same day b/c I enjoyed it so much.   For three years I remembered the Big Wac with longing and nostalgia, and today I had it again. Its quality had not been inflated by my memory, and I really enjoyed my lunch.   Service is prompt, food is good, prices aren't unreasonable. It's also very conveniently located right by a bus stop, so it's easy to access by public transportation."}
{"text":"I went to the Tempe/Scottsdale location for lunch and this one for dinner, where I just got the chili side. I have a moderate spice tolerance - I like some, but I don't have a taste for really extreme heat - and it felt just right to me, and not a bad size for having been listed as just a side instead of an entree.   This location is also very close to a bus stop, and that line allows several easy transfers to the light rail system, so it's easy to access by public transportation.   It also has a little bit of seating outside in both the front and back, and is right next door to another vegan business, which is either great planning or a happy coincidence.   I really liked both of them. I think if I lived in the area I'd probably prefer the Tempe/Scottsdale location just because it has a bigger parking lot, a little more space, and more natural light but this one is still pretty good, and I look forward to trying more of its foods in the future if I'm ever back."}
{"text":"Love this place and so do my kids.  That says a lot.  The food is delicious and healthy.  It's also reasonable.   I love the thai with chicken and the tahini slaw"}
{"text":"Low cost, great taste, cruelty-free.  What more would you like?  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I flippin' love this place. Tasty tasty food.  I do hate that I have to order at a counter, and I hate that it's so damn loud in the restaurant, and I hate the parking.  But the food makes up for everything else. I love Green!"}
{"text":"Very good! The food was tasty and fresh!  As a vegetarian, it's so nice to be able to choose anything on the menu! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place & go every time we are in the area. It's artsy eclectic style has cafe style tables as well as a sofa and chair seating area. Different art decorates the walls. The exterior is very blah, but don't let it fool you. Once inside you will find a really hip & trendy place. Great friendly service with amazing food. The green hummus rocks as do their Soynami's! The Green burger is phenomenal too! It's always busy, but well worth the wait. We have never had anything there that wasn't good. Very affordable too. My kids & I are vegetarian while my husband is vegan and this place satisfys us all. This place is a quality vegetarian place & they like to be eco-friendly & green... added bonus as far as I am concerned. Can't wait to fly back to the Phoenix area to stop in this awesome gem of a place!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this small, wonderful vegan oasis in Phoenix. The food was nothing short of great. I had the \"karma curry\" with vegan mock chicken -- great flavors and the mock chicken was incredible. My friend had the \"thee fighting artichokes\" salad which was spot on. And we shared to the \"chili fries\" just to sample the vegan chili but ended up cleaning the plate in short order. Prices are great. Portions are generous. Staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. The food arrived quickly and hot. There are seating options inside and out. And it seems to be busy with eat-in and take-out orders at all times. Only drawback -- parking at the restaurant and next door at its sister dessert/sweets cafe can be challenging during the busy times. Still, this is my new \"go to\" place when down in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Kudos for offering tasty vegan delights and meat alternatives to satisfy that occasional craving. However, the food here is quite greasy and not necessarily healthy. I ordered the Argentinian Po Boy and it was drenched in oil. The beef seitan was literally dripping in fat, and the peppers and onions were stir fried in far more fat than necessary. I also ordered the spicy peanut chicken seitan salad. The greens could have come out of a bag, the chicken seitan was oily beyond imagination, and the dressings were 99% oil.  The single dollar sign price rating is misleading. This place is EXPENSIVE because the portions are very small. You would expect a Po Boy to come on a decently sized bun, however what I received looked smaller than a basic hot dog bun. It tasted great, but the portion size and high fat content made for disappointment.   While I am a vegan, I eat a very low fat and healthy vegan diet. Although tasty, the food here is prepared with an obvious disregard to basic dietary common sense. Don't come here thinking you are eating healthy - you are not. However, on those occasions when you want a greasy meal without the meat guilt, this is your place. I would not recommend eating here on a regular basis unless you are prepared to ingest a lot of vegetable oil with its negative consequences.  To the owner and chef - why don't you offer a healthy, low fat menu to those of us who don't want our vegan meal to contain more fat than a quarter pounder with cheese and fries? There isn't even an option for low fat salad dressings. I fear for those who come here thinking they are eating a healthy meal. Vegan /= healthy here.   Why three stars? Because I enjoy this place on those occasions when I want a greasy fix without having to eat meat or patronize an evil fast food chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Trendy, overpriced but well intentioned. The Big Wac is mediocre at best. The vegan meat patties are so thin I kept asking \"where's the beef?\" After a couple of bites the meat patties mushed up and turned into the consistency of humus. Way too much bread, it's all bread. The thyme fries had no thyme whatsoever that I could see or taste. For $12.50 (burger alone is $9.75 and you have to pay $2.75 for fries) I expected more. There are many other vegetarian restaurants in town that serve tastier and healthier food. I admire the vegan focus but the execution isn't there.  If I can make better vegan meat and vegan food at home, there's not much reason to eat at this place."}
{"text":"Ive been to Nami and thought it was awesome. But I never had the chance to try Green until now.    I tried a good amount of things and highlight all the details below.    Jamaican Bowl Thing - Super fresh, brussel sprouts were fried just right. The sauce they use was a low toned sweetness that wasnt overbearing. The vinaigrette was a little too powerful in the first few bites, but subsided immediately after.    The crab ragoons were a freak of nature. Its hard to believe that it wasnt cream cheese or imitation crab fr that matter. It didnt necessarily have the fishy taste of the sea, but it was damn close. The sauce they give with it tasted like au jus! I could have ate a boatload of those things.   The samosas were a solid option. They weren't as crispy as I like, but they had some flakiness, as well as a nice overall mouth-feel with the grease. Oddly enough, I wish the containers of dipping sauce were wider, as I had to break the samosa down for it to fit.    The chameleon taco had a great, bold flavor. I thought of it as a southwest flavor, even though I dont think thats what they were going for. The tempura batter taste was spot on for what you would expect on a piece of chicken. The eggplant and sweet potato are already soft, so they spill out of the tortilla fairly easily. As long as you eat this carefully, its worth getting.    They serve fresh fruit that tastes great, but I m annoyed that they only gave me pineapple and grapes. Im not asking for the Chiquita banana hat in my bowl, but Im expecting some type of variety. Maybe if they listed what fruits were actually available, I wouldn't have been as perturbed.   Overall, I was quite excited with what I had. I feel this establishment is a not-so-hidden gem of the community."}
{"text":"First off, I am not Vegan....not even slightly. I love myself a good slice of fish or some wholesome chicken like the next guy. However, I have shifted my lifestyle choices recently to a more healthy overall track. So keep that in mind when reading forward.  Green is the first \"mock\" food joint I have ever eaten at. Considering the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I took my fiance over here to check it out. We both were cautiously optimistic about the abundance of options on the menu. Laura (my fiance) chose a mock meatball spaghetti, the Orecciette pasta. The mock meatballs tasted more like falafel than meat, however the sauce and earlobe pasta was amazing. Also added in were the veggies within the pasta....overall she really chose an awesome dish.  I chose the seemingly popular Original \"g\" spicy po-boy sandwich, with curry pasta. Biting into the mock chicken, you could tell it was not real chicken per say..its obvious. BUT, the amazingly tasty flavors along with the buffalo sauce just run rampantly on your taste buds. The curry pasta I got as my side was as good, if not better than the sandwich itself...I could eat that curry pasta all day.  So, with that said, two dishes tried, both tasted AMAZING. You can tell the food is not real, but does it matter when the food tastes so great? I'll answer that for you with a resounding no...no it doesn't matter. It gets 5 stars just for the fact that the culinary experience may be different, but the end result is significant satisfaction on multiple levels. Think about it:  its great for you, the soy products within are amazingly healthy and everything is organic for the most part when you eat here. I will definitely be making plans to set aside a few $'s just for a \"Green Fund\" so I can eat here at least a couple times a month. Will re-post when I try something else...perhaps the pizza??? Will update soon!!!"}
{"text":"Gosh, Green is just the best. I wasn't even vegetarian when I first started coming here, much less vegan. I didn't even know it was vegan until a few trips in. I'm about 90% vegan now but it doesn't even matter. Good food is good food.  My favorite thing to get is the Original G po-boy with sweet potato tots, but always always check their specials. And the soynamis....eat them. Eat all of the soynamis."}
{"text":"Plenty of options for a great stirfry. Loved all the sauces. I think it could've been arranged a different way so that the sauces don't slop into one another. Food was served quick and I had lots of fresh veggies for my day over rice. Been twice."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant!! Fresh and delish! I've had 3 of the garden burritos - the peanut chicken is amazing! The ranchero is really good too! Oh and can't forget thee fighting artichoke!!   None of them will disappoint! :)   I would have given a 5 star rating - except I don't like the system they have for orders that are placed on line, I don't think they have a system- not even a online orders pick up here - sign! Beats the point of placing an order on line if you still have to wait in line - horrible specially during lunch hour DT!"}
{"text":"The menu changed during 2013, and I preferred the previous menu to the new.  The new mock chicken is still the best around, but it's not as good as the previous.   The food here is awesome! Vegetarian or not, everyone loves this place. The food is creative, delicious and made from fresh ingredients.  The mock meats are so good and so well prepared that you will forget it's mock. I LOVE the wings, especially the new jalapeño flavor and the \"original g\" or \"wendy's pickle\" are great choices, but so is everything else on the menu.  A tsoynami for dessert is a must, they have a long list of options, check them out, you will be in love.   You go up to the cashiers and grab a menu, take a seat and decide on your meal, then return the cashier to place your order. They will give you a number and bring out your meal, but there is no waiter service.   The ambiance is trendy, and laid back, very casual and welcoming."}
{"text":"What to say about green. Well it's a pretty awesome place to start.   I've gone there quite a few times now since going vegetarian and my first visit I was shocked on how the foods I use to eat can be mimicked and actually tasted better! Green provides all sorts of different menu items They have rice and noodles bowls with mock meats and tofu, salads, burgers and sandwiches, mini pizzas, and delicious \"Soynamis\" which are their soy based ice cream (delicious) They have specials as well so you may want to follow them on twitter or like them on facebook!  Green  also gives you a selection of side items including fries, tahini coleslaw(a favorite) pasta, etc and many come with the main item as a meal. They also include appetizers including artichoke gratine which was a yummy dip with chips, vegan chilli fries, crab puffs(another favorite!) and \"boneless wings\" with their homemade vegan ranch dressing. The only unfortunate thing is that both times I've had their wings they have been way too salty. So it kind of ruins it.  My fav things to get there, and if you're going there for the first time you must try their sandwiches! I am a huge fan of their secret bbq chickn sandwich. Messy but it is so satisfying and almost creepy on how well it imitates a real chicken sandwich but it's guiltfree and deliciously crafted! This sandwich will not let you down! My boyfriend also got me into the argetine which has a steaky taste mock meat in  a sub-type sandwich that will sure to make your mouth water. I have had one of their noodle bowls with mock beef and sweet and sour flavor but it was not as filling as their sandwiches. Maybe because I didn't think there was enough noodles but they're pretty good!   Now the place itself is pretty hipster. Artsy feel and vibe and many times there will be artwork for sale or art contests going on. It's definately a cool environment they have a couple couches and its a great place to dine in and bring your friends. It's not really a waiter/waitress type thing. You grab a menu in line order what you want at the counter and pay and then they bring it out to you when it's ready. Most the time it's ready rather quickly and you don't have to worry about flagging down a waitress/waiter if you need anything.  Green also hosted I think it was the 3rd annual thankliving last year that I went to for the first time that had a delicious vegan thanksgiving plate that included everything you could imagine for thanksgiving veganized! Delicious! Definitely an event you don't want to miss!  All and all I love this place. Veg comfort food at it's best!! And it's not just for Vegans I swear even if you're not a herbivore you will love green!"}
{"text":"Love it.. Just love this place and everything about it. The service is too notch, neck it doesn't get better. I love the people working here. They are always very warm and friendly. The good is the bomb ! I and up craving the food here more often than I care to admit. I really have not one complain about this place.. Ok maybe one.. They should stay open later and then it would be perfect-er (?) !!!!   Hem even the meat eating carnivores love the place..so the question is why are you still reading the reviews when you could be enjoying the deliciousness of green"}
{"text":"Green New American is one of the best vegan places I have tried!  The layout of the restaurant is simple with a slight hipster vibe. You seat yourself and can choose between a table or a booth. Even when this place is busy the wait is never too long. Costumers are able to grab an easy to read menu and decide what they want before they reach the cash register which makes the line go by faster. After the cashier takes your order you just find a place to sit until they bring your food out and if you are ordering out they will usually just call your name out but if you are eating in you are given a number to put onto your table. I have never waited more than 15 minutes for my food even on a busy night.  I have been here twice and tried different things each time. The first time I went to Green New American I tried the Chicago Cheesesteak with fries. Since it was my first time eating here I was not sure what to expect. However, when I received my meal in a little brown box I was surprised to see how full the sub was. I took it to go and was so excited to try it. The meal was just a delicious as it looked. You can't even tell that the cheese and meat are vegan. The thyme fries were also just a good. If you gave this to someone who did not know the meal was vegan they would have not been able to tell the difference.  Since I do not live near Green New American the second time I went here I ordered as much as I thought I could eat. I got the big WAC, animal fries, buffalo wings and a chocolate milkshake. I was most excited about the milkshake, it was nice and chocolaty and again you could not tell that there isn't any dairy. The cheeseburger was also delicious! I was shocked how real the 'meat' tasted, the texture and taste were both on point. It was one of the best vegan burgers I have ever tried. Next the animal fries, the cheese and sauce were so good! I just wish there were more in the box because I could not stop eating them. I was bit iffy about the buffalo wings they did not taste bad it just the texture I did not enjoy. However the dill sauce that came with the wings was really good, I was dipping my fries into it. Most vegetarian and vegan restaurants are usually overpriced however all the items here are not!  If I lived closer to Green New American I would probably eat it every day! I would recommend this place to anyone who is vegetarian/vegan and even those who are not. This is a great restaurant to try out if you are in the area. The only thing that would make this restaurant better is if they added one in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Good if you want vegan food. Had The po boy sandwich that was pretty good. Couldn't even tell it wasn't real chicken. A little out of my way but might return if I decide to be vegan someday."}
{"text":"We need more restaurants like Green!  Simple, well prepared food.  Plenty of variety...not mindless, \"I can't make a decision variety\"...more, \"there is something here for everyone\".  The  asian noodles are DELICIOUS.  Staff and patrons are friendly and helpful.  Comfortable, easy environment.  Everyone I know who has eaten here loves it, vegetarians and meat-eaters alike!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Had the Bid Wac!  Deliciuos!  You would not know this thing is Vegan.  Fries were good.  Also had the cole slaw which was tasty.  Afterwards we went next door to their dessert place (Nami).  Vegan ice cream!  Yum!  If you crave that hamburger you might be missing, this place, the Big Wac, will help satisfy it.  Cant't wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm vegan and love having vegan options.  They just changed their menu a bit and I miss the pizzas.  The prices are a bit high, but I find myself ordering so much food when I go there.  Appetizer, meal, drink, and an amazing Soynami.  I don't care for mock meats and that seems to be the direction these restaurants are headed.  I'm vegan because I don't like the idea of eating animal products."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan (far from it actually) but when a friend and I wanted to meet somewhere healthy and causal, this was the perfect choice. I had the thai peanut bowl with mok chicken and it was so good! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The Dagoba Jungle is fantastic, I get it almost every time I'm here. The \"chicken\" wings are great too!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good! More reviews coming soon, but can't believe how they made the veggie Big Mac very impressive and the juices on the dine in are the best I've ever had. Actually rapper ice cube is covered on the ice cube machine, very hip and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Such a good ALL VEGAN restaurant! I got the original \"g\" spicy po-boy and it was amazing! The garlic hot sauce they used on it was so delicious. I heard their burgers and wings are the bomb too. You order at the counter, get a number and pick your own seat. Then, they bring our your food when it's ready! They have sitting indoors and outdoors. They also serve alcohol! On Sundays they are not open but next door Nami's is open for brunch. You can order your food at Nami's then head over here to grab a bloody mary or a mimosa. Bathrooms outside. Friendly staff. Food came out quick. VERY SMALL parking lot."}
{"text":"So, it is kind of hard to rate this place. On one hand, my wife and I went here because we are pretty healthy eaters when it comes to our meals - she's practically vegetarian and the only meat I eat on any regular basis is lean chicken, and we both freshly prepare most of our meals with low salt and low fat. So, coming here, you get a very good vegan replication of what are high fat, high salt meals, which people like us don't like. So, was my Calexico burger an excellent replication of a traditional american double burger with cheese down to the very color of the cheese? Yes! Do I actually like traditional american double burgers with cheese? No. Chicken wings, were exceptionally good despite their high salt content, the flavors of the sauce were very much enhanced by the salt, rather than being overwhelmed by it.  If you go here with a full understanding of what you are getting, you will like I it. They have a very varied menu and speedy service. I would definitely go back and try out some other things on the menu that people mentioned in the yelp review, I think the food concept and execution is very, very good and wish we had this amongst our dining options in New Jersey. I wouldn't go here frequently, but I would go here about twice a year, to get something different - which is almost exactly the same as standard fast food, but completely different because its vegan. It's all very confusing :)"}
{"text":"Let's just say that these guys should take all my money. It was so exciting find a vegan place to eat right next to out hotel  we sort of order the whole menu but my favorite think was a plain of \"cheese\" burger. I was heart broken when I saw that they were closed on sundays. I wanted one last try before heading back home to vegas. Come to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Like many others, here is my disclaimer.  I am not a vegan nor am I a vegetarian but I do enjoy vegetarian foods from time to time.  I had the classic flatbread pizza. I wouldn't get it again. The bread was soggy and the cheese (if you can call it that) left something to be desired.  Not sure I will be back but I was eying the menu of wonder \"DQ Blizzard-like\" treats."}
{"text":"LOVE this place to bits! The Buffalo wings are hands down the best vegan wings I've ever had in regards to both texture and flavor. Every time I'm in Phoenix I have to stop here at least once for a fix. All of the salads are good with my favorites being the Peanut Chicken and the Dagobah Jungle. The crab puffs are a bit greasy in my opinion and didn't have much in the way of flavor so I'd personally skip those. Same with the burger, it simply tasted like a grocery store bought Boca burger.   If you have room, definitely get dessert! Their donuts, cookies, and etc are the bomb! Easily waaaayyyy better than their traditional counterparts. The Yankie Doodle cookie sandwich is my fave (two snickerdoodle cookies with frosting in-between). The Tsoynamis are a hit or miss in my opinion, sometimes swaying to the watery side instead of creamy."}
{"text":"After becoming a huge fan of vegan food with the opening of J. Selby's here in Minneapolis, I knew when I went down to Phoenix to visit my parents I had to try their predecessor Green New American Vegetarian. I got the Classic Burger without cheese and the buffalo wings, both of which were surprisingly cheaper than back home at J. Selby's.  The burger was good, but average. I could tell it was a veggie burger unlike the Solo burger at J. Selby's where I couldn't tell at all. The burger was very reminiscent of a Boca burger in my opinion. The wings however, oh my GOD! I could have eaten five orders of those alone! They are easily the best vegan wings I've ever had and I still have cravings for them. I just wish they could tell me how they make their wings so yummy. I wish J. Selby's would forgo their cauliflower based wings for these. But then again maybe not as I would never leave. LOL."}
{"text":"If you are a veg head ( I am most of the time, but breakdown every-so-often), this is the place for you!  You have got to have the hummus!  They have some of the best hummus ever.  They specialize in vegan food and even if you don't like vegan food, you have to try this place...you just might change your mind.  I had my sister and the kids get some take-out and the kids were not going to like it not matter what.  They loved it!  So even if you are an exclusive carnivore, give it a shot!  You might find a whole new kind of food to love!"}
{"text":"I have been vegan for almost 2 months and I am so thankful that I live close to Green! I first discovered Teese Cheese there, which they use in some of their dishes. Teese mozzarella tastes and melts just like the real thing! They sell it by the register to-go. We use the Teese all the time for pizzas and pasta dishes at home. I love their poblano hummus and pita chips for an appetizer. I absolutely adore their mock chicken; it is purse heaven. Their greenza pizza is fabulous, as is their kung pao mock chicken bowl."}
{"text":"Complete revamp since the last time I visited and boy what an improvement! The old restaurant was great too, with tasty vegan entrees and a trendy vibe. But now they've added more seating, polished up decor, craft beers and even more food/drink options. You still get a hole in the wall local eatery vibe.. But with more flair.   Everything I've ordered has been tasty.  The mock chicken is pretty convincing. You can't beat the taste or price. Finally vegan doesn't feel like a deprivation.  (Full Disclosure: I am not vegan,  but I try it out at times).  Bonus, the coolers feature take-n-bake cookies from their sister restaurant, Nomi.   Bringing the kids? They have a kid friendly menu and cool coloring comic sheet while  waiting for your order."}
{"text":"Phoenix is lucky to have this place!  Vegans rejoice as the food was amazing.  I had to go there twice on my visit.  For starters, the staff is very friendly and were happy to be there.  The drinks: Great selection with some organic choices like lime/lemonade.  I mixed it all up which tasted great.  I will say that trying each individually was nice too.  I love that they have green tea as one of the options.  I did not get anything from the fridge as they had sodas and other things there.  Nice.  The food: Fries were awesome considering they were thin cut which made them crispy throughout.  Not sure if they had another options, but we got the thyme fries.  I recommend it.  Sandwiches were bomb! Big Wac - Well, if you like the Big Mac when and if you ever ate meat, this is it without the guilt or blood.  Tasted awesome and I am surprised that this was vegan since the cheese was so cheesy.  Barbeque Chicken - A big sloppy in which you may need a knife and fork to eat.  Me and my friend split it, so we just cut it in half and it oozed with sauce.  Great sauce and great sandwich.  The extra sauce is a nice dipping item for the fries for sure.  Faux Lay Of Fish - Awesome!  Since I had a fish sandwich before while I was eating the last bite, I had to make sure it was not real fish.  My friend reassured me as she is a fish eater.  I on the other hand was surprised.  We had to get it again on our second visit.  The only thing is for those going there to try this, it is a seasonal item or special.  I hope they have it when you go!  Diablo Bowl - Not bad and had great seasoning.  We had a mix of both noodles and brown rice (friends wanted that as I only wanted noodles).  That probably didn't help the dish, but in the long run, the dish had a nice flavor.  Would try again if I am ever in the area after getting one of the above beforehand though.  We also went next door to try a cake.  Although their other stuff was pretty good based on some sampling, that cake was way too sweet.  It was my mini birthday cake though, so THANK YOU for putting that candle on it!  :)  Made me extra happy."}
{"text":"Amazing! Hard to believe it's vegan! Their wac n cheese is drool worthy! Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Yeah, that was great!  We got lucky and timed our visit between the crowds, somehow.. there were a dozen people in line when we left. (This does my little vegan heart good, btw) I listened to the server and ordered the \"taco of the day\" which was crispy potato with chipotle spices and peppers, and my hubby got a burger and loaded fries.. I also ordered my favorite, brussel sprouts, which were caramelized and delicious.  We will have to return and try more items - my husband particularly liked the name of one of the drinks, the \"electric nectar.\""}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. I started going a few years ago and have probably eaten everything on the menu with the exclusion of some salads. The decor is interesting, lots of different artists have their work displayed on the walls and it changes around every month. Green can get very busy, especially during the dinner hours, and you might have to wait for 15-20 minutes in line. The cashiers are friendly and your food is usually brought out surprisingly fast.   Decor and service aside, the food is amazing! Buns can sometimes get soggy(secret bbq sammie) and some things are very salty(the chili), but at the end of the day it's delicious and comforting food. Their Big Wac is better than Mcdonald's, and I wouldn't want mock chicken from anywhere else. Seriously, the mock chicken is like a tender crunchy giant chicken tender. Their fries are thin cut and crispy and I love pairing it with the BFF, a spicy and savory chicken sandwich. They are generous with the portions here, and I often over eat because the food is so delicious. Any of their sandwiches are a safe bet to order and what I would recommend the most. The animal fries are tasty, but I think there should be more toppings for how many fries come with it. The wings are good, as are the samosas, but for the price of both I think there are better valued things on the menu. Good vegan crab puffs are hard to find, but Green definitely delivers delicious crab puffs. Thee fighting artichoke and peanut chicken are yummy salad options, and I would also recommend the Thai peanut rice bowl. You might think after all that food I'd be stuffed, but every time I MUST order a Tsoynami. It is the end all be all for vegan ice cream. The vegan answer to a blizzard is definitely satisfying: a creamy sweet ice cream swirled with whatever toppings you choose, from vegan butterfingers (Betterfinger) to delicious granola and peaches (Lifes a peach). I highly recommend their ice cream tsoynamis. Between those and the Big Wac, anyone would be sure to leave satisfied.   I gave Green five stars, because while there are a few menu items I won't order, it is the best place I've found for vegan comfort food, and maybe even omnivorous comfort food as well. Really really tasty food has earned my 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I just went vegan a week ago and have been searching for a decent place to eat out at. I happened to come across this place online and I am so glad I did. Love it here! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. My son has so many food allergies and they were so helpful about making sure to order food that was safe for him. That is surprisingly still hard to find. Most places we go to really do not bother even though if he eats the wrong food he can end up in the hospital We ordered the 'chicken' wings, 'crab' puffs, chili, kids' 'chicken' nuggets and, of course, their infamous Big Wac. We loved it all!!!! Another pleasant surprise was that they serve wine which was very decent for $5.50 a glass. We will definitely become regulars here and our other meat eating places are a thing of the past. Thank you , Green :)"}
{"text":"If you like fancy rubber this place is awesome! I even got some soy ice cream (which normally I am a huge fan of) and it tastes like mud pies after a rainy day near a sewer."}
{"text":"Saldy, my first negative review goes to a restaurant that I used to enjoy.  For the second time in as many visits, the staff at Green forgot to prepare my food.  I didn't post a review after that experience, but felt this warranted one.  I ordered the BFF and a side of fries on the advice of one of the staff members.  But after waiting 25 minutes for the food and watching a number of people who ordered after me receive their meal, I said that I wanted a refund.  A different staff member went into the kitchen, clearly couldn't find my ticket, and asked one of the kitchen staff if they had my ticket.  I could hear the kitchen staff say they did not.  When the same staff member returned to me, I asked her if the kitchen had even started preparing my food.  She stated, \"They are cooking it, but we'll be able to cancel it.\"  At this point, after being lied to, I realized that I don't need to support this business.  Like the lack of courtesy given me about the status of the food prep, the refund process was just as lackluster.  After offering a gift card in the amount that I paid (because that's exactly what a customer wants from a business they don't like), I waited another ten minutes while two different staff members tried to figure out their point-of-sale system.  Ultimately, they couldn't figure it out and just handed me my money back while scribbling what they had done on a piece of paper to jog their memory later.  I guess the best thing I can say for Green is that, while they wasted 35 minutes during my lunch hour and made me late for my next meeting, I saved $8 by quickly buying and eating a sandwich from Walgreen's.  Maybe not as tasty, but then again, I've never eaten the BFF since Green failed to even let me try it."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best pure veggie chow around.  Their not-chicken sandwich with fake cheese is better in some ways than the real thing.  You're not always reminded that you're eating vegetarian when eating here.  It's just tasty.    A veggie place that you can take anyone and have them enjoy it is a great and rare find.  This is such a place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  The ambience is casual and hip.  The service is warm, friendly and attentive.   The price is more than reasonable.   I would be a regular here if I could, and I'm not even vegetarian!!!  Alas, I live in Northern California, so I will just have to look forward to dining here again during my next visit to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! I don't live in AZ but was visiting a friend. She brought me here on the way to taking me to the airport. I wish we would've gone here sooner so I could've had the chance to eat here more than once.  We ordered a Big Wac and the vegan chili fries with cheese. The vegan chili had really great flavor. The cheese was both crispy and melty, which made it good to eat. The Big Wac didn't work for me because it actually tasted just like a Big Mac. I never liked the original and this version was too real! The name of the place says vegetarian but one of the workers assured me that everything is actually vegan, which is sort of a big distinction. If you're trying to convert someone, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a big fan of the tree-huggy, veggie crowd, but this place wasn't bad at all.   Aside from all of the 3rd grade level refrigerator \"art\" hanging on the walls, it was actually a decent restaurant and I would go back again. I don't remember exactly what I ordered (Its been about 2 months), but it had fried tofu in it I think. All I remember was that I was very nervous going in, but when I tasted the food, I was pleasantly surprised.  Oh yeah, and just for the record: bloody, red meat is not bad for you. Moldy, green meat is bad for you. :-)"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food - Huge meat lover but loved this place. Great owner very nice guy.   We were a group of 10 people and mostly meat eaters but made for a great lunch."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give 10 stars I would.  This restaurant is the best and the staff and management are amazing to work with. I had 3 days to plan a small get together for my best friend's wedding reception.  It was happening at the courthouse and I wasn't going to let her get married without a party.  Since both she and I share similar food allergies, choosing Green was a no-brainer, especially since I could order a cake from Nami next door and have it delivered.  We ordered some appetizers (which were promptly eaten) and Jeanette was so incredible to work with.  The staff at Green and Nami really helped to pull together what might have been an empty evening into a wonderful celebration for my best friend and all of her old and new family. Thank you so very much Green for making it possible on such short notice! BTW, on a side note, their chicken enchilada nachos (which was the special that night) were positively amazing.  The food is top notch each time I visit."}
{"text":"The best fast vegan food I've found thus far! Everything on the menu tastes incredible. My favs are the Thai Peanut Wrap and the haystack tsoynami. If you're feeling a burger the Big WAC and the BFF are delicious guilty pleasures.   They have beer and wine ( I think margs too) and take and bake cookie dough, which is cool.   Only downside the place is not set up for its popularity. During rush times the line is out the door and there's not enough seating."}
{"text":"Heaven for Vegans! very popular place so unless you go on a very off time plan to spend anywhere from 10-25 minutes in line. Once you order it's hit or miss if you'll get a table there or need to take it to go so just be cautious if the space :)   Amazing food. Soynamis are a fantastic alternative to a blizzard. They even have wine and beer options. 10/10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Service was not to par. Honestly you're not at work to chit chat your life away with your coworkers and treat  the customers like their not even present. Another 2mins and I would have walked out if it wasn't for my husband walking to the counter to retrieve a menu from under another customer who was just standing over the menus, also talking to the cashier about other things that had nothing to do with ordering food. So years later when we finally ordered, And received our food... (Which we got to go) my husband got the animal style fries. Which he didn't like at all. The sauce was too much mayonnaise and no pickled relish. Which last we checked thousand island should have pickled relish. And my sandwich was super plain. Honestly it wasn't anything special. I've had vegan fast food that tasted better than this."}
{"text":"Small place yet amazing options.  Ordered - Sesame dragon with mocked chicken - portion was a meal perfect. Mocked chicken tasted yummy. I have tried mocked chicken earlier, but this place oustands the competitors I believe. Wild wings - this is a very small portion of chicken with some tangy red sauce. A side of sliced carrots and cucumber. I would just say the best. Obviously a beer goes well with the menu. I opted for a peach ale. I wouldn't comment as these guys won't brew them.  Ambience is good and a very quick service. I would rate this a 4.5. Could have earned a 5 if tables were clean and no water/food spills on the floor."}
{"text":"Hands down the best mocked meat in town.  Ordered -  Buffalo Wings : tasted delicious. The red sauce topping is the secret. Totally blasts the sour and tangy buds on your tongue. Singapore Orange Chicken - portion is huge and healthy af. Brown rice, broccoli and carrots gives you the best flavor.  Very good ambience, quick service. Parking lot is tiny but if you are lucky enough you'll find a spot."}
{"text":"I was only in Phoenix for 3 days and managed to find my way here about 3 times. I was a bit confused about the labeling here where a couple of things said vegan while others not. But everything here was plant based. Everything that came out of that kitchen was so good. The house made drinks were set up so you can try and choose which ever one you like. I appreciated this a lot. Also in the fridge, there were so many drink options including various teas and kombuchas. The people working there were so nice, and the place was so clean. I couldn't complain about the interior decor either. I was so glad to have found and stopped into this place when coming through Phoenix. It was definitely one of the reasons visiting this part of Arizona was so fun for me. Would recommend to all vegans and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Really good meatless chicken. It tastes just like chicken. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I still really enjoy this place. The thyme fries are awesome, and the bowls are always good too. Service is always friendly and quick. Everything is very affordable. A lot of vegetarian food is really expensive, but here you can have a good lunch for about $10 or less. Only downside, parking is a pain, it always has been. But it actually really improved from how it used to be at that's a wrap."}
{"text":"The only way to get me to a vegetarian joint is kicking and screaming. No more. I can't do tofu, which is the main reason I don't go to these places. Here they have a mock chicken (and beef) choice. I was told it's mushroom and soy paste. Sounds horrible to me. Delicious.  Added bonus was tamari in the sauce (gluten free). The bowl was with good veggies and brown rice. The flavor was great."}
{"text":"The food: I have had all sorts of things from the menu - the \"chicken\" sandwiches are amazing. The no harm chicken parm and the bbq chicken. YUMMMM! The bowls are tasty and satisfying. The chili fries are a nice treat. My favorite dessert is the chocolate peanut butter bar. Drooling just thinking about it. They also sell vegan products like fake cheese, cookies, grains, etc. You don't have a server, you order at the counter, get a number and someone brings out your food. They do have a tip jar at the counter. TIP THE STAFF! They are all nice and friendly there and will help you if you're stuck figuring out what to get. I've never been disappointed. I've gone many times when I lived in Phoenix and made a point to go back on a recent visit. Will eat here every time I'm in town.  The actual place: The vibe inside is casual and low key. The walls and furniture are bright and colorful. They have booths, tables and couches (my favorite corner). Very cozy. Limited outdoor seating when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This is one of our absolute favorite restaurants. The food is amazing. The first time I came, as a tourist to Phoenix 8 years ago, I came with a carnivorous friend who turned up his nose at vegan food. He was outnumbered when it came to choosing the restaurant, and begrudgingly ordered a faux pulled pork sandwich. He asked to go back the very next day.   I've lived in this city for 7 years now, and when friends come to visit this is one of the restaurants I always recommend. I have tried around half of the menu, but since I've discovered the Wendy's pickle I am hooked (fried faux chicken with pickles, buffalo sauce, and vegan mayo on a ciabatta roll...) My husband always gets the Big Wac (vegan Big Mac, obv). If it were up to him we wouldn't bother eating at other restaurants at all. I have to put my foot down for the sake of variety... still, if I had to choose only one restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life... maybe..."}
{"text":"Vegetarians & Vegans: you're gonna love Green, that's for sure. The place is 100% vegan ingredients & food. And it is delicious!  Everyone else: you're gonna like it too! Pretty much everyone that I've taken to Green or talked to that has been there (Vegetarian or not) has enjoyed the food. They've got an awesome selection of appetizers, entree items & deserts. Check em, yo."}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that would make me go right back to Arizona and head straight there before I do anything else. I knew nothing about the restaurant. I was just trying to find some place with a lot of options on the menu since the group I was with went to another restaurant with limited vegetarian options. As guilty as I temporarily felt about leaving my group, I 100% didn't after taking the first bite of food. It is incredible. I had crab puffs, blonde alfredo, vanilla ts'mores and a couple drinks. The beverages are okay. Nothing major. But the imitation crab puffs are delicious. I loved the vegan version of the blonde alfredo, especially with the chunks of vegan chicken. And as a former Girl Scout who ate entirely too many s'mores as a kid, I thought eating those were long gone as a vegetarian for over 10 years. Not so fast. I loved their ts'mores. I could've had another full cup of that alone. If/when I ever go back to Arizona, there is 100% chance I will revisit here. The prices are super reasonable. The service is casual and friendly. It can get packed in there, but because the weather is usually nice, what makes the crowds easier to withstand are a lot of people go outside and sit at the outdoor tables. Since there is no waiter service, people order from the front and get their foods sent to the table. I loved it. As much as I usually tend to lean towards quieter vegan and vegetarian restaurants, I liked that this one had a \"Noodles & Company\" or \"Chipotle\" vibe and speed. And again the food was mouth watering."}
{"text":"Green is amazing, best vegan junk food I've ever had... Ever. The big wac is a veg version of a big mac, it's delicious and their fries are great too. While your there stop at their sister store Nomi, and grab a dessert, ice-cream but vegan, yum town. Thats at the 7th ave or.. Street location.    Decent atmosphere, but the food is what justifies driving from Tucson just to get it....yep, its that good, even non veggies will love it. I also adore the wendys pickle, its like fried chkn in a bun with mayo n pickles... With fries... Love that one, kind of a po-boy sammy thing."}
{"text":"I love this place! Take your meat loving friends here and I'm sure even they will be surprised!  First time we went healthy and opted for a bowl- it was good but this time we got the Big Wac and had to leave a review!  Its gluten free and suffering free (vegan) and taste like junk food!"}
{"text":"Green is the new black, just don't tell my husband! Actually, he might agree with me. Finally got the meat eater to come to Green for the first time and he was in heaven! It was my third time there and this time I got the Spicy Thai dish and my husband got the Kung Pao. Both meals were delicious, filling and satisfying.  We may actually head back there for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!   We ordered some starters with one burger. The starters taste amazingly close to meat unlike other vegan restaurants. The ambience is nice and cozy and the service is sweet.   Over all if you want to have something not too lavish but good enough to satisfy ur taste buds in a warm atmosphere l, this is the place !"}
{"text":"I'm not even done eating yet and I had to come leave a review.   This place has their shit together! So good.   I'm not even vegetarian   Can we please have one in the East??  #cometoAJ #mesaworkstoo"}
{"text":"Let's be real. This is vegan fast food. Good if you want fake meat done well. But I do find it ironic that Green serves nothing green. I would give them a solid 3, but my last visit, I don't know if they changed things... but I always remembered having a side of coleslaw with my sandwich, and now you literally just get a sandwich on a blank plate. Nothing else. Just seems kind of like it's - not a meal at all. I'd rather stay home and make healthier plant based food.   Bummer."}
{"text":"Oh Green, why did it take me so long to try you? I came here with a very picky vegan friend and we both left very satisfied. We had the hot wings, peanut tofu and the curry bowl with tofu and brown rice. Everthing was Yum! Everything was so tasty I didn't even reach for the siracha, and I do believe that is the best compliment I can give, because I LOVE siracha! I also had the lavender soda which was a great change of pace from other sodas out there. Green my only request is: Please come to CenPho!!!!"}
{"text":"Green is amazing! Great vegan food and desserts. They also have a small selection of vegan grocery items, like vegan cheese substitutes and vegan snacks, which are all delicious. The employees are friendly and the atmosphere is nice as well. Finally, just writing this review makes me want to go get one of their amazing Soynamis, which are like blizzards, but even better (and vegan)!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Texas \"Moo Shroom\" Po Boy and it was delicious. Portabella, caramelized onions, red peppers and espresso bbq sauce? UNF. Seriously though, that sauce was amazing.   The thyme fries were perfectly seasoned and not at all greasy. They were a little thin and \"stick-like\" for my preference but I still ate all of them! That's the only reason I gave the place four stars instead of five.   I had no complaints about the staff and my order was brought to my table in no time. I'll definitely be returning to Green!"}
{"text":"I love this place for comfort vegan food.  It has everything I like.  My favorite is thyme fries.  I actually have not found anything I dislike there.  The owner really has a good vision of what great food tastes like.  It is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome! Big Wac tastes just like a Big Mac!"}
{"text":"It would get five stars but the food took a really long time to come out (Scottsdale location). Other than that it is an awesome place for vegetarians, vegans even meat eaters!"}
{"text":"Almost every time we come into Phoenix from my home up north, we stop at Green. It's hard to go from the quick, tasty grease of traditional American carnivore meals to vegetarian. Green makes it a little easier :). The Big Wac is amazing, tastes better than a Big Mac and I have convinced a lot of carnivores to go try it. A few decided to go full vegetarian after knowing they could still get flavorful, comfortable tastes without having to settle on just rabbit food or squishy tofu. There are a few thing that didn't tickle my taste buds (the kids mac&cheese, tahini coleslaw and crab puff dipping sauce). But everything else I have really enjoyed. LOVE the Spicy Peanut Tofu as does my tofu-hating brother, which is saying a lot. The No-Harm Chicken Parm is the best and the Original \"G\" and BBQ Chicken/Portabello Mushroom Sandwiches are incredibly tasty. I like to ask for extra thyme for my fries because yes, depending on the kitchen, I have noticed it can get be a little skimpy :/. Overall, if you're in the area and willing to try something different, try Green."}
{"text":"Tonight I lost all respect for this company. I have eaten here many times and all the food has been okay but nothing has been great. I usually just go to treat myself with a soynami, however, tonight I went to get some soynamis for me and my siblings and was extremely disappointed. All of the soynamis were filled close to the top except for one which was only half full so I asked that they put a little more in it thinking there should be no problem. The gentleman, the owner of the company, told me that he could not fill the rest of the cup because they are \"weighed out\". I asked again if there was anyway he could just fill the rest of it because there was such a difference and he continued to refuse to go ahead and fill the cup. It was a simple request and the customer service was completely horrible. I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Tempe. The wings are amazing, the big wac is filling, and the artisan drinks are refreshing.  Don't then this place down because it's vegan, everything tastes like chicken or beef and in some Instances, better."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ tempeh mushroom bugger,  kombucha, and protein bar to go. Best vegan comfort food I have had in a while. Wish we had more restaurants like these in Denver. I go out of my way to places like these when out of town and it was well worth the drive. Met the owner. He was working along with all his people. Great indi feel. Support small business."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS MY JAM!! So, after figuring out that i'm lactose intolerant, it's hard to go out to eat good food that also helps our world out a little bit more while also not endangering me from any nasty flare ups.   Enter Green and their sister restaurant, Nami. You gotta get the big wac if you wanna have the vegan equivalent of a big mac (and IMO, tastes a million times better!). I love the dagobah jungle in a wrap and their fries are delicious. Nami is equally awesome with their Tsoynami's that let me satisfy my sugar cravings without a dairy flare up on a hot Phoenix day. They also always release a limited edition, one day Tsoynami so run down and grab one before they're gone"}
{"text":"Went there to have lunch, had the bff, it was awesome.  My friend had the big WAC and was impressed as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I are vegetarians, and make a point of eating at local veg establishments when we travel. I was very excited when I saw the website for Green...it really looked intriguing.   We've been fortunate to have been able to dine in a lot of really, really, good vegan establishments, so we have pretty high expectations. The days when \"vegan\" meant \"bland,\" \"underseasoned,\" \"hippy\" cuisine are long past, or so we thought. I guess there are still some places out there that are stuck in the 70s...definitely Green fits that description.  I was a bit taken aback, after looking at the website and reading about \"Chef Damon's\" vision, to find myself in a tiny hole in the wall waiting in line for counter service, though I could have gotten past that had the food been stellar. I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas.  Still, if the food had been good...  I ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler.  Almost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving.  The samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing.  My husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them \"French Fries\" and have done with it.  My take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it. If this is the best Scottsdale has to offer vegans, you're better off cooking at home."}
{"text":"So unbelievably good. Small restaurant and parking is tight but went there on MLK Jr. Day, Monday night, about 7 pm and could easily park. There was still a decent line inside, I can imagine a Friday or Saturday night might be a bit crazy here. Split the crab puffs, Big Wac, and Wendy's Pickle with a friend...all of it was amazing. Definitely can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Thai Peanut Chicken Salad today...AWESOME! I had the small size and it was perfect. Not to big or to small. I will certainly get this again and soon!!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the location off Scottsdale Rd so this was my first time trying the 7th St location. I used to go to this location when it was the former restaurant \"It's A Wrap\" back in the day and I love the remodel since Green moved in the space. Parking is always hard at this location so I had to park a few businesses away and walk over. I got there a little before noon and there was already quite the line. The line moved slower than it does in Scottsdale and I ordered my Spicy Thai Chicken Salad (my favorite) and ordered it to go incase I didn't have time to finish the entire salad during my lunch hour. I'm really glad I did because by the time I got in the door, stood in line and got my order I had 10 minutes to eat my lunch. I think next time I will call my order in ahead of time so the wait is a little less and I can eat my lunch with more time to spare.   Still very good, services was good and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Healthy and satisfying. I had a rice bowl with \"chicken\". It had tons of flavor. Also tried the BBQ sandwich was was yummy too. Great place"}
{"text":"Super tasty vegan food that has a ton of options. Recently I ordered the \"chicken\" sandwich and I loved it."}
{"text":"What an adorable and delicious spot. Enjoyed the big wac and the yummy tea. Then went next door for an ice expresso and cupcake... Absolutely delicious. Also tried their chicken wings and artichoke dip, both tasted very good as well. If you're a vegetarian, and ever crave the taste of meat, but can't eat it... This place will definitely satisfy your craving. Will be back to try something new. My husband is not a vegetarian, but loved the food as well. The portions are filling and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I get asked \"Have you been to Green yet?\" almost as often as I get asked \"Have you done a summer here yet?\" Thankfully, I can now say yes to the first question. And I think Green may be an answer to my survival of the summer here in AZ.  My friend and I wanted to get a bike ride on a beautiful night but didn't want to just get a beer and we kind of wanted to go around the Tempe lake, ruling out southern Tempe options. Green. Green is open on Mondays! (BUT NOT SUNDAYS) And til 9! Its 7:15-lets get our asses movin'!  Smack inbetween major traffic lights (thus hard to cross), we found a full parking lot and an empty bike rack...sweeeet. Just about every table was full with a pretty diverse crowd-mostly hip, but everyone was real casual and didn't have their Scottsdale poker face on. I was confused when we first walked in-do we get seated? I stared and smiled at one woman who I thought was a waitress-but then she sat down. Whoops. A tad awkward, no? Went to the counter and greeted with beautiful lil menus-they have a LOT of stuff. AND I CAN EAT ALL OF IT.  I am a lactose-intolerant vegetarian. But not vegan. But a vegan diet is the healthiest one for me, obvi. My mind was blown away. Even at vegetarian places I still have half the menu eliminated due to dairy. Only at the Angelika Kitchen in NYC Village am I this over-whelmed. And while Green may not be as healthy-who really cares when its THIS GOOD? I was so overwhelmed I just went for the Argentian sandwich-fake beef strips with hot sauce and fake cheese added WITH a choice of sides for 6.50? That is VALUE. I opted for the fountain soda (their unsweetened iced tea is a good deal), but I saw they have Virgils' Root Beer, the best root beer on earth after Stewarts-and will totally get that next time.   We sat down in the somewhat dimly lit room-it is kind of industrial feeling, but not hippy at all-but not overly chic at all. Reminds me of a cross b/w Orange Table and Lux in terms of ambiance with the casualness and hottie factor of Pita Jungle. There were multi-coloured car doors lined up on the far wall of the restaurant and the noise level was cordial. We got our Crab Cream Puffs first-ooooooommmmyyyygoooood. For like 3 something, I was in a very special place. I didnt even know you could do that with tofutti cream cheese! Amazing with a sweet tangy sauce. Our food came pretty quickly and I got to have my thyme fries with a side of Vegannaise. My sandwich was HUGE and for no other ways to describe it as BANGIN. I miss Philly Cheese Steaks-and this is my happy replacement!   The owner ended up talking to us and I asked about the soy ice cream-they were out of cones which made me inexplicibly sad. He said they do Soy-namis, which are their version of Dairy Queen's Blizzards where they made a thick shake with goodies added in. I walked back up to the counter and had trouble figuring out what I could possibly add to my stomach so I didn't keel over in a food coma off my bike on the way home. I went for the super sweet and did like a sundae in a cup with newmans chocolate oreo things and chocolate sauce with cherries. It was amazing. It was like 3.50 and it was too much for us 2 to share...but that doesn't mean we didn't finish it.  I can't believe it took me this long to come here-the atmosphere, options and the cheapness of the food shocked me. I mean, people had told me it was good, I just didn't expect it to be THIS good.  My friend even admitted she went back the next night b/c she couldnt stop thinking about my sandwich!  So yes, those Soy-Namis may be how I will \"do a summer in AZ' '07!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegan spot. Coming from an Austinite, that's high praise. The Kung Pao tofu bowl was amazing. Expand to Austin, even if it is just a trailer ;)"}
{"text":"I called and ordered to go on Saturday night around 7:40. I ordered 2 orders of the buffalo wings, the  cheesesteak and the BBQ mock chicken sandwich. They told me the wait would be about 20 minute. I got there at a few minutes past 8 and the place was jam packed. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking for quick service on a Saturday night. I could see my order finished and waiting but I had to wait in a line of about 5 customers. Not a big deal, but I think it would be beneficial to have a line specifically for to go orders.   I waited in line for about 10-15 minutes and got my food. I brought it home to my girlfriend (whose vegetarian) and we sat down to eat. She got the BBQ sandwich and it looked and tasted great. The wings were awesome too! My only problem was my cheesesteak. I don't think it's normal for it to only come with one bun (on the bottom). It still tasted good, but obviously it was a bit messier than I was hoping for having only one bun.   All in all, the food was great and I'll be sure to come back. I may not order to go again though.   Cons: Parking, order pickup, lack of buns.     UPDATE: Came again to show my mom and brother. The food was much better. I think it does taste better fresh out of the kitchen VS. Out of a to go box. I had the Po Boy sandwich and loved it! Much better experience this time.   Best of all, they gave me 2 buns this time :)"}
{"text":"Since coming here for the first time in July, I have visited green vegetarian 3 more times. I have gotten the chicken nuggets, blonde alfredo, macaroni and cheese, and the BBBQ bacon burger.   I got the blonde alfredo with the mock chicken. I was not expecting the pieces of \"chicken\" to be breaded and fried. I was expecting it to be more like grilled chicken. They didn't really belong in a dish with a cream sauce.  Speaking of the blonde alfredo sauce, it's very good! Tastes very similar to the real thing. I will definitely be getting this wonderful dish again but I will probably get plain tofu or no \"meat\" on it at all.  For the Mac and Cheez it was lacking in flavor and the cheese was not melted enough.  The BBBQ bacon burger had a bit too much mayo and barbecue sauce on it. The tempeh bacon was okay, but nothing like actual bacon. It was too thick and did not really have the flavor of bacon. The sauteed portabella mushrooms and caramelized onions were the best part of the burger, along with the sesame seed bun!  The chicken nuggz had the flavor and texture of real chicken nuggets! The barbecue sauce and ranch dressing it comes with are also wonderful. These would definitely fool your kids. ;)  The blonde alfredo and drunken mongolian probably tie for my favorite meal at green vegetarian.  To wrap up my review, this is my favorite restaurant in the area! I love green vegetarian so much."}
{"text":"Unbelievable i haven't put my 2 cents in about Green, despite being a frequent customer. this vegan restaurant is so adept at making non-chicken \"chicken\", you will swear they made a mistake.   the first time i ate here, i for sure thought they put chicken in my sandwich but was assured it was not chicken. since then, i've tried a variety of their dishes from the noodle bowls to the \"buffalo wings\" to the \"rib\" dinner and have never been disappointed with any of my meals.   Green is a testament that vegan/vegetarian meals don't have to consist of just a plate full of side dish vegetables. the prices are extremely reasonable and the interior decor is kind of like that \"kitsh-industrial-hippy\" look. customers order at the counter and the food is brought out quickly, and you self-serve drinks so the water glass is always full!"}
{"text":"the wife treated myself and her sister to another great meal at green restaurant tonight. i opted for the lemon pesto with house tofu, pan fried noodles. it was again, quite delectable. the pesto was plentiful and the tofu soaked that goodness right up. we again opted for the buffalo wings and i am always impressed at how damn good they taste!  always a great food treat!"}
{"text":"For being a vegan restaurant, this is probably going to be the best you can find. I must say that I'm really not a big fan of the fake meats or dishes that try to be vegan when they really shouldn't. However, I would say that the stuff that we ordered was really good. We started with the chili fries and these were actually super good. Fries were nice and crispy and the chili not only had flavor of a legit chili but the texture was there too. You have to get a side of the ranch too. My wife and I split the Thai peanut \"chicken\" wrap and it was definitely the best fake meat I had ever tasted. It actually had a good texture and the crunchiness from the peanuts and the sauce all went really well together. Whether you are vegan or not, you will most likely enjoy this place."}
{"text":"This food is delicious!  I heard about \"Greens\" when I attended events that they catered, and the food was so good I just had to find the restaurant. I'm so glad I did!  Just go there!  Do it!  Your tummy will be happy!"}
{"text":"Heard about Green from alot of friends of mine who are vegetarian or vegan. Thought I'd take the family to try something new. Glad we did!  Ordering was very easy and before we knew it, the food came out, super fast and hot! My lady ordered the kung pao bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. The kids got a burger with cheese. I got the Big Wac. All the food tasted very fresh and filling. Super satisfied.   As a whole, this place was great. Super friendly staff and great food. We will for sure be making Green a norm on our food outings."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Amazing! Got off our flight from San Francisco and was greeted by all this amazing vegan food?? Everything we ordered was awesome and if I'd had the time I would have gone back to try more. We had the buffalo wings, bff sandwich and Chicago cheesesteak. Didn't get to try a Soynami but they came highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very disappointed they ran out of average things in the menu. No pork tacos and no chai tea. Better be better prepard"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. It is my oasis in downtown Phoenix. I understand that the food here is not terribly healthy but it is INCREDIBLY delicious and all vegan (praise be to Jah!) As a vegetarian, I already eat pretty healthy so this place is always a treat for me.  I would avoid the obvious lunch and dinner hours because this place is very popular. Also the parking lot can fill up pretty quickly so plan the timing of your visit accordingly.  I don't really care for the salads here but I compare every veggie burger I eat anywhere to the outstanding BIG WAC (a vegetarian Big Mac) and I also love the buffalo wings, crab rangoons, and occasionally I get the tahini cole slaw. The same owners own Nami next door so on the rare occasion that I still have room in my belly for more, I'll get a s'mores tsunami from Nami as well."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant for anyone who thinks that vegetarian food can never be as good as its non plant-based counterparts. If you are on a quest for delicious vegetarian comfort food, you'll definitely want to try Green. (AND they're kid-approved!) They've got a fridge full of yummy Kombucha, an Ice Cube-adorned drink machine and vegetarian hot wings that will make you forget that you're not eating meat. The fried Brussels sprouts are amazing, I have to have them every time I go to Green. Their staff is always so cheerful and nice. You can also hop right next door to their vegan dessert-y counterpart, Nami, for yummy cookies, ice cream and other sweet treats."}
{"text":"This is a must every time I'm in Phoenix. Food is incredible. Service is great. And then I always stop by their vegan ice cream shop next door.Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is superb!! They are extremely nice and yes it is difficult to make a choice.  Note to the customer: if you see a line behind you don't just stand there and make people wait because you can't decide. What I did was take a menu and stand outside of the line and when I was ready I hopped back in.  That's a new concept! Isn't it!  Lastly, the food was delish! That's why they are getting a 5from me."}
{"text":"Let me just say, their vanilla soft serve with fruit is the bomb! This is a great place for anyone who is craving something on the unhealthy side. As a vegan who eats mostly healthy, sometimes I just gotta ditch the fresh veg and go for something like this - it hits the spot well."}
{"text":"Oh my, so good!  Their Big Wac is amazing.  My husband who is a legit meat eater was in awe of the taste and how it literally was better than a Big Mac.  My toddler gobbled up the chicken nuggets, more so than \"real\" chicken nuggets.  I think I drank a gallon of the elderberry tea.  Everything was so darn good.  I only wish there was one closer to me in the East Valley (open one in Gilbert!).  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My daughter who once told me she loves whoever invented meat asks to go here, I think that pretty much says it all."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good. Highly recommended. Service and atmosphere are good but not outstanding really. But not bad and the food is great, so there you go!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived the place was full with only one seat open, which was a good sign. We got the bbq wings and the samoas. Being a restaurant called \"green\" we expected the dishes to be presented more healthily. The wings were lacking in flavor and only came with 2 carrot sticks and celery. The samoas were good in flavor, but rather oily. Overall, the best part of our meal was the kombucha."}
{"text":"Amazing tasty delicious food!!! BBQ Sammie was flavorful with tangy sauce.  Very satisfying. Yum!! We will return."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I liked it better before they changed the menu. I feel like it's harder than it should be to eat gluten free here. Most of the items on the menu have wheat and gluten in them. I recently went vegan, and I wish this could be a regular spot for me, but vegan and gluten free is tough to do here. I love Salad and Go and will continue to go there as it's far easier and less expensive to do vegan and gluten free. I will probably not return and will make Coronado my to to place as they make vegan and gluten free easier and more delicious."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOOOOVE GREEN.   I don't love their parking. Beware. Carpool if you can. DON'T PARK AT COCO'S. They sometimes tow.   That being said, their food is DELICIOUS! Proof that vegetarian and vegan doesn't mean tasteless! Definitely get the fries, they're seasoned and pretty much perfect. You get a decent serving of them, as well.   Brunch is served on Sundays, I've never been disappointed. The Biscuits'n'gravy is quite tasty."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a really nice atmosphere and a great selection of vegetarian and vegan options. The fake meat was really impressive and tasted delicious! One thing to note, however, was that there wasn't very much parking and it was really hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"I am one of the hugest carnivores but I really wanted to visit Green and see what it was all about Also I use Yelp to find different dinner meals through the week Before I showed up to Green I noticed that it had a ton of good reviews which made me think A) Reviews all/mostly written by Vegans B) The food is really legit I ordered the small \"thee green salad\" and it was very yummy The cucumbers were my favorite I am not a huge fan of green olives but I ate some of them :) I don't know what the dressing was, but it was delicious I also had the veggie rolls with the sauce and they were really great  I think Green is one of those places I will visit to get a break from all the bad stuff I eat"}
{"text":"I have been here countless times. Every time it's stellar food. Seriously. These guys know what they're doing when it comes to vegan dishes. The entire restaurant is vegan, and my mom who is an omnivore loved her food too.   I usually get the BFF because of the jalapeños and the vegan ranch. They're AMAZEBALLS.   Also, try the thyme fries. Sooooo gooood.  ETA: the fighting artichoke salad is spicy for someone that's sensitive to heat!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best vegan food I've ever had. I will drive from Mesa to eat here once a week if not more. Delicious food and amazing people. Try the BFF - it's awesome especially if you love avocado and jalapeño. Ammmmmaaaaaazing food. Cannot say it enough."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh best food ever!!!  I'm not a vegetarian but my mother and father-in-laws are.  So on my girls day out with my mother-in-law yesterday I decided to take her to this restaurant due to great reviews with yelpers.  I got tired of eating the same thing and it's hard to pick restaurants for vegetarian.  First of all the staffs are wonderful and so helpful.  Place was very clean even though it was very busy which is a good sign of great food.  I ordered BBBQ bacon burger with thyme fries and my mother-in-law ordered Singapore Orange with fried noodles.  We shared it all to taste since it's our first time there.  Oh my gosh the sandwich was so yummy with that awesome BBQ sauce.  And fries...best fries other then my mom's of course. Even my mother-in-law who's not a fan of fries couldn't stop eating this fries!  She loved this place so much that she's going to bring her husband here.  I was shocked that they never came here since they lived in Chandler for at least 20 years.  Oh and the Singapore Orange was delicious with mock chicken that I could eat all day.  Only thing was my mother-in-law wished there was more noodles so next time we'll order extra fried noodles on the side for her.  We also had tsoynamics recommended by one of the staffs there.  My mother-in-law likes ice cream but doesn't do well with dairy due to her IBS, so when she heard no dairy is in tsoynamics we ordered one and nice staff split one for us.  It was delicious even for me who is ice cream snob.  I LOVE ice cream and this was delicious with very clean after taste.   Yes I will be coming back to try other fabulous items with my meat loving husband.  He's going to be shocked!!!"}
{"text":"The big wac is always a great go to! The meal is incomplete without a delicious Nami!"}
{"text":"I've never actually been here but at work we get take out from here all the time and it is incredibly delicious. It's so good and I can't believe it's vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"Bicycle-friendly and vegan, Green is one of my favorite places.  I ordered a Mickey sandwich with a side of faux Buffalo wings.  While that was being prepped, I ducked out to Nami next door and got a peanut butter and chocolate blizzard, non-diary treat.  It was obvious that I should eat the Nami first, because its the best.  That Nami was so delicious it made the whole meal a real treat.  Thanks to the cooks at Green and the folks at Nami I had a vegan feast fit for a peasant.   Cole slaw, french fries and tasty vegan meats layered between toasted bread of the Mickey sandwich, it was simply good."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian restaurant.  Good food and really inexpensive!  Nothing fancy but gets the job done.  You feel good about what you have eaten!  Hidden in a crazy little strip mall but worth seeking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good stuff here! So I've been to Nami before and it's one of my faves but this was my first time at green. Awesome place to get your meat-free junk food fix. Everything on the menu looked so good it was hard to choose! I ended up getting the big wac with a side of fries. I feel like $3.75 is a little pricey to have to pay for that side of fries, but they were pretty yummy fries. The big wac was massive! I loved the sauce on it. Honestly didn't care as much for the patties but I think that's just my personal taste. Was a nice big meal though! The friend I went with got a mock chicken BBQ sandwich and a tsoynami that had a bunch of stuff on it, she enjoyed it!  A little pricey but cool place to go try something new. I'd like to come back and maybe try some tacos!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, so so food selection. I guess my gripe is that the food here is really just glorified healthier stir fried Asian food.  Props for offering textured protein as an offering (rather than just tofu).  The sauces are good, and the portions are decent.  It's just not the type of food I crave, possibly because it is so healthy.  Be prepared that the parking lot is terrible.  Drive the smallest car you can or carpool."}
{"text":"Being a new vegetarian, I am trying my darndest to find veggie-friendly restaurants that offer variety and don't suck the life out of my wallet. GREEN is, by far, the most brilliant. I went for lunch, and the staff was friendly, the food was awesome and the atmosphere was very laid-back-- not too hipstery, not too commercial. My favorite thing, though, was the fact that the \"pseudo meats\" were super yummy... sometimes they really just taste like cardboard. But not at GREEN! Yay GREEN! ps. The Tsoynami is also ridiculously yummy. Get the peanut butter and chocolate."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The staff is great. The owner is great. You should upload a photo of that AMAZING person that won the photo contest!!!"}
{"text":"Ever chug a gallon a water and still feel as if you're thirsty from food that's been over-salted?  That's exactly what happened to us.   We checked out Green in Phoenix.  I must warn you, parking is a bit of a nightmare.  Very limited spots and fills up fast.  Standing in line to order was very disorganized and it took about 25 minutes to get our food.  I can understand waiting that long if you have a sit-down restaurant, but it's a pretty casual restaurant.  The wait seemed excessive.  I ordered the Singapore Orange and hubby had the Original PoBoy.  We shared our meals and I'm sorry to say, I was under-whelmed and felt queezy from all the saltiness.  We drank tons of water thru the night and still had a funky after-taste the next day (YUCK!).  I really wanted to like Green as I've enjoyed other Vegan restaurants.  I think they have way too many cuisines.  They serve: Thai, Indian, American, Italian, Greek & Mexican.  Focus on one or two and make them exceptional."}
{"text":"Went in hungry to check out the Big Wac and left satisfied and happy. It wasn't very obvious that it was a vegan burger for anyone steered away by that fact, but  it was all delicious. It is quite a hefty portion, and a bit more than you would pay for it's meaty counterpart, but certainly worth it."}
{"text":"This is the BEST vegan food I've ever had. In fact, it's the best food be had in general."}
{"text":"Absolutely impeccable food. Vegan is the way to go. Green really allows new vegans to experiment with something incredibly realistic and delicious. Not to mention their dessert spot is to die for, but not literally because no animals had to die for it to be THIS GOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a vegetarian for about a month now. I was sooo happy when I found this place! Their food is amazing and helps me get that \"meaty\" taste I've been missing. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegetables! I got the coconut curry mock chicken bowl with noodles and it was great! Veggies cooked quite firmly but nicely done dish overall! Good amount of seating. Fast good for lunch break or a catchup with a friend !"}
{"text":"For some of you this place is a Great little spot to eat .  For the rest of us we dawn robes and Chant religious verses in dead languages inside a Dimly lit old stone church too appease the great Green . All hail Don't ever change beautiful."}
{"text":"One 3 letter word. WOW. I was in the mood for something spicy, so i got the original spicy \"chicken\" sandwich. It was delicious mock chicken and the veggies were fresh. The spice level of the sauce was perfect it had a really nice kick to it, but not  the point of watering eyes. My one complaint was the gluten free bread. The texture and density of it was not good.  It was really dry and it soaked up too much of the sauces on my sandwich.   Not going to lie though,  I was still hungry after I finished eating. Mind you i just finished playing a sand volleyball tournament. So next I ordered the green hummus the chicken wings and the BFF which is a fried \"chicken\" sandwich to try and take home leftovers. The hummus was great, as well as the corn tortilla chips it was served with, nice and crunchy. The hummus said it was made with roasted poblano peppers which I didn't notice but it was very tasty. I didn't like the quality of the \"chicken\" wings as much as the chicken in the chicken sandwich. It may have been the same but just sliced differently. And as for the BFF fried chicken sandwich it was outstanding. non-vegans might have thought this was real Fried Chicken. I also asked for a side of their Expreso barbecue sauce which turned out to have great tang and flavor. I can't wait to go back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"A treasure on a trip was found today.   I was in AZ until just a few hours ago, and I feel compelled to write my first AZ review about this place, GREEN.   A definite vegetarian delight.   The offerings were many, and my Green Burger, actually Red, was DEE-Lish.    The thyme fries also yum-yum.  The space was welcoming with the VW car doors & various parts + poetic justice painted upon the wall, the mini-market shelf & cooler grocery items also just a straight-up love fest for me.   I also had some crazy good tasy coffee beverage that carried me all the way back to Chicago.   Happy people go here, you can see it on their faces, and the staff - super-duper friendly to out of towners like myself, offering up words of wisdom on the area for my next visit.   The place is hard to find in a tiny strip mall in the corner, next door to the Salvation Army and a fantastic bike shop.   Happy visitor made happier by GREEN."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Adina Howard - Freak Like Me)  Let me Bo Bites as I dine I got a little vegetarian inside And you know that my fans  Has got to deal with it  I don't care how I sing I'm not about to stop for anyway Cause it's all about the food in me Mm-hmm   I want some Green in the morning Some Green in the evening just for me I need a Soynami That can satisfy me just for me  If you got that kind of taste Cause I'm into that kind of eats I got a veggie craving, everybody eat Cause we don't give a damn about a thing   Green has been a vegetarian staple restaurant ever since I've moved to Phoenix!  Every time I come back there's something new and something old.  Improvements and renovations are always made in this quaint little corner restaurant.  I don't feel like I'm a hippie when I come here since there seems to be all walks of life young and old that come here.    Today I started with a craft beer and the Big Wac Burger.  I actually order the little Wac with fries since the Big Wac seemed like a little too big for my appetite.  Overall, it was a knock-off version of the Big Mac, but with no processed meat.  I thought it was pretty interesting, but in the end nothing too original.  My buddy ordered their spicy buffalo wings made with soy chicken -- this was probably my favorite bite of the night; spicy indeed and a hint of crunch.  I think if they didn't douse it was the sauce it would have made a perfect combination, but still good overall.  I also ordered the Soynami for dessert; a valley favorite and must eat especially during the summer time.  It's pretty much soft serve ice cream in a pint with toppings of your choice of candies or baked goods.    In the end, Green is definitely a local hot spot for vegetarians, but also foodies whom want to venture out and try something new.  With the popularity of Non-GMO and Vegan movement coming strong; I can see Green staying for generations ahead! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Green was one of the first places I went after going vegan. I made the decision over night, so when I woke up one day and had decided not to eat any animal products again, I felt totally lost. Green is where I went to get a meal that would actually fill me up for long enough that I could figure out what to eat next!   I could go on and on about this place. The staff is always wonderful, and I have actually had pretty much every single item on the menu and would recommend almost everything.   Being vegan makes dating difficult, but when a guy asks me, \"Where can you even eat..?\" I feel confident that whatever he likes, he'll find something he can enjoy if we go to Green. The local beer doesn't hurt the cause at all.   THANK YOU for being awesome, Green!!"}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you Green! My family and I have started a vegan diet about 3 weeks ago and Green has been a life saver for me.  My lunches out during the week have been rescued from missing all the foods I used to eat by given ng me healthy vegetarian options.   Do I miss meat....yes, yes I do. Is this diet forever? Not sure yet, but regardless of that I will probably always find myself coming back to Green."}
{"text":"By far THE best vegan place I've been to. I've been to multiple vegetarian and vegan restaurants in different states, and none come close to Green. I thought it'd be easier to find places like this in LA, but I can't find anything that compares! As for the menu, I've had every bowl, multiple appetizers, and one of the sandwiches (bbq mock chicken) and I have NEVER been disappointed! You're good with anything you order here. The tsoynami's are bomb too.  Tip: Always ask for extra sauce when ordering bowls! They make them pretty dry, but they are AMAZING when there's enough sauce."}
{"text":"After reading an article in the Arizona  Republic paper about the best Vegetarian restaurants to dine at, I discovered Green. I went with a coworker during our lunch break and since they open at 11am we got there shortly after they opened. I had \"Thee Argentine\" with thyme fries and she had the \"The Green Burger\"; my sandwich was unbelievably good, strips of seitan mock steak sauteed with caramelized peppers  and onions, vegan mayo and a spicy chimichuri sauce, all on a scrumptious sub roll.  My friend loved her burger she said you could not tell it was meatless. We both got Tsoynami's  her choice was \"The Fruits\" where you pick the ones you want, and I got \"Deez Hazelnuts\" mine was heavenly. My total for the sandwich , fries and dessert was $13.50 not bad for a tasty,filling healthy meal. I went back and had the Original \"g\" Spicy Po-Boy made with spicy buffalo mock chicken, lettuce, tomato and  vegan mayo. This place rocks and it is always packed that is a good thing cause I need them to stay in business."}
{"text":"Once again Green comes through with fantastic vegan fare! My cousin was in town for a conference and she wanted to meet up with me for a meal before heading back to L.A, so we decided to meet at Green and she loved it, she ordered all apps, the buffalo wings, spicy peanut tofu and the crab puffs. I had the Big Wac and my husband had the Alfredo. Everything was flavorful and delicious. No one left food on their plates and we finished our meal with desserts from Nami next door."}
{"text":"Berry lemonade and veggie burger w/Sriracha made me very happy!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant I have ever been to but weigh that with the fact that this is the first one I have visited.  :) I have wanted to try this joint for some time given they carry their version of a Big Mac, called the Big Wac and if I am going to try vegetarian I wanted to be doing it eating a Big Wac. In addition to my first visit, I brought my 74 year old father who also has never had a vegetarian meal and thought it would be fun for him to. As for our food experience, wow, if that was vegetarian grub, I am now officially a vegetarian. Everything we had was on point. The spicy wings were awesome. The sauce for the wings was what made it stand out. So flavorful. As for our Big Wacs, oh and with the thyme fries of course, it was a tasty meal.  Now don't get me wrong, it does not surpass the Mac as the flavor of real meat does carry weight but our Wacs were darn good. Tasty and as close to a Mac as one could ask. Could of used a little more sauce, if I am being picky. Overall, a real nice meal with a slightly higher price point. That seems to be par for the course though when eating anything that is slightly better for you. Will have another Big Wac in the future for sure."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, let alone vegan, but I ADORE Green. I had their Big WAC and can't stop thinking about it days later. Will definitely be back! Nice staff, great food, happy tummy!"}
{"text":"Came here to chill. And a chill place it was. The fries and the buffalo wings were good. I didn't expect them to taste that great but the flavor was authentic and so was the texture. The prices here were not too bad either so I recommend any vegetarian to try this place. :)"}
{"text":"Diverse menu and unique specials. I have to admit that sometimes I want a dish with a meat=like texture. Green menu has that and great variety of other vegan dishes. Then there is the guilty pleasure of vegan desserts at Nami - right next door. We ask family for gift cards to Green, as we know we will be regular diners there throughout the year."}
{"text":"Yummy! Not too many healthy options, but if you're looking to splurge on some junk food, or convince your non-vegan friends that vegan food is fun and delicious this is the place to do it. They recently updated their menu, with that their prices went up...again. However service is pretty good and the food is delicious, creative, and filling. I often wonder why they aren't open on Sundays, especially because Sundays is the main day of the week I have the time and energy to travel to one of their two locations, but I have learned to live with it, especially supplementing with Nami and their deliciousness (see other review).  Be aware of their hours of operation and check out Sunday brunch at Nami which is served at Nami, but essentially hosted by Green."}
{"text":"Ex and I used to eat here and I'll probably be back if I don't see him around haha. Seriously though, their mock chicken is super flavorful may it be in the salad or noodles. I love the tea drinks!!! The ambiance reminds me of Haight st. in San Francisco, very chill. I love their fries! Waitstaff was always helpful specially for a newbie like me. A solid recommendation for my fellow vegans!"}
{"text":"I am in complete shock. I am a meat eater I just ate the best burger I cannot believe it.  Get the big wac and you'll just sit there smiling enjoying what you just had in your stomach. Yum. 5 out of 5 stars. My girlfriend had the orange chicken lettuce salad and it was very good four out of five stars."}
{"text":"In an attempt to move toward a more vegetarian/vegan diet, my husband and I decided to give Green a try. We were both completely amazed at how good our meal was and are sure to be repeat customers.   It was difficult to decide what to have since almost every item on the  menu looked delicious. I finally settled on the No Harm Chicken Parm with Thyme Fries and my husband had Wendy's Pickle with Tyme Fries. We both had green tea to drink.   Our sandwiches were both delicious. This was my first try at vegan cheese and the faux mozzarella on my sandwich was delicious and added just the perfect touch. The tomato sauce was rich and garlicky and balanced out all of the flavors.    My husband took one bite of his sandwich and declared, \"This is really good!\" High praise from a man who eats everything but rarely gets excited by any of it. We both loved the bread our sandwiches were on and thought the fries were awesome.  We will be back, Green, to try all of the delicious items on your menu. Next up: The Big Wack!"}
{"text":"Since switching to vegan I haven't eaten out in literally months. I kind of lost my desire to because home cooked vegan meals are so good, until I stumbled upon green.  Their mock chicken wings are to die for, the mock crab puffs are seriously amazing, and their animal and thyme fries are delicious!  I will continue to cook at home, but it's nice to know if I ever need a vegan option for food it's available!   My only complaint is the f-ing line you have to wait in when you show up. Due to it being in Tempe and basically the only vegan place around that wait time was insane. I went in at 630 on a Friday and the line was out the door (literally) and I had phoned my order in at 6. It was done already, and I sat in that line for almost 20 minutes.   Also, the staff looked like they hated their jobs - not a single smile on any of their faces.   The food was worth it though! The quality of food was all in all pretty good.   Just make sure if you choose to go here to plan accordingly, this isn't somewhere you can show up for a \"quick bite\" to eat. There is a wait time, and the staff could give a sh!t less how long you wait.  I personally can get over that stuff for some good food (that I didn't have to cook myself), but I know others can't."}
{"text":"Ugh one of my favorite restaurants in the valley and I am not even vegan! Been coming here for many years. Sure the lines can be long and they may occasionally leave something out of your order, but it doesn't take away from how amazing this restaurant is. I am so addicted their soynamis (banana cream pie and s'mores especially) and their big wac and Thai peanut bowl."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious here, but my one complaint is the portions are kind of small depending on what you choose. Today I had a salad with mock buffalo chicken and it was perfect! Will be coming back soon (:"}
{"text":"I love Green and this location is so much more convenient than the Scottsdale location. My only gripe is the hours. I feel like they close too early and should be open on Sundays too. Give me MORE Green please."}
{"text":"Pretty good vegetarian food. The dishes were pretty darn savory and tasty. Also, there was a nice selection of foods to choose from. Prices were decent for what it was. If you want a meal without meat this place offers a great alternative."}
{"text":"We are addicted to this place. We love the ranchero as a wrap with avocado. We usually split this and add animal fries and potstickers. Oh my goodness. So good. We tried the spinach fundido and it was not our favorite. It was bland. Everything else is fabulous."}
{"text":"This place has great Vegan options. I had the cheesesteak special that was very tasty. My friend had the salad with  Brussel sprouts that was so tasty. GreAt service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a business trip to Phoenix. I have to say the big wac was amazing. It brought back all the memories of a McDonald's Big Mac without all the concern with ingredients. I will make this a staple meal on my business trips here. We also had the buffalo wings, crab cakes and everything was delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If all vegetarian food tasted like this I would stop being a carnivore. The skinny  After missing out on a movie premier and having some time for a date with my significant other who happens to be a pescaterian we decided to try green as she has been dying to try the big wac. We called in our order and decided to pick up order took less than 10 min in and out great :-). The burger was great I could see why it's a big hit and the French fries are awesome I ate the whole batch. What really made my day was the organic sweet lime drink omg it was not too sweet and not too bland but just perfect mix almost like what u would like ur lemonade to come out like. The price was a lil high for me $11.50 for the meal but I think it was worth it. I was beyond full. The bad  I asked the cashier if it was possible to try the tea with a sample cup she said yes and gave me a big cup and charged me for it even though I asked just to sample maybe I didn't say it loud enough, and she charged me for it without first confirming that the price went up it ended up being ok as I liked the drinks they had. So no big deal. Overall This place is a must for anyone looking to improve eating habits or wanna try something diff for a change I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I love Green. All of my friends (veg or not) love it as well. They never have any qualms about going to Green for a meal (or treat). I go to Green a few times a month, and always leave happy and full! You can't go wrong with the wings. I typically  try the special if there is one. My go-to is the Original G. It's a buffalo faux chicken sandwich-sooooo good! I am mildly obsessed with their wing sauce. Other faves of mine are the BBQ Chkn Sandwich, the Ranchero Salad (Sub buffalo sauce for bbq), the Spicy Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl, and of course Soynamis.  The staff is mostly pleasant and accommodating. Green is a great place to people watch, too. Yes, it definitely has a hipster feel, but there is quite the variety in their cliental.  Green maybe not offer the healthiest and lightest of vegan fare but definitely some of the best tasting! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Visited Tempe/Scottsdale area and found this treasure.  Went three times for take out in two days, for four total meals and a tsoynami.  Everything was delicious!  Had the Argentine Po Boy, Lemon Basil bowl, Thai Peanut Bowl and the Chicken Artichoke salad.  Wished I lived nearby.  I would definitely eat here often!"}
{"text":"This vegan restaurant is simply amazing.  You would be hard pressed to not realize the meatless products you are eating are not made with, well, meat.  I have never had a bad meal here, and would recommend it to anyone.  You should definitely try the buffalo wings and the fries.  If you stop in, the Tsoynami lives up to its grand reputation."}
{"text":"As first timers, we had a great experience and ordered the following:  Buffalo Wings Animal Fries  Big Wac  BBQ Sammie  The wings were the best part of our meal. The buffalo sauce was very good and the texture of the wings was nice and chewy. The wings aren't particular crispy, but my non-vegan boyfriend said he preferred them to Buffalo Wild Wings. We want to order a platter for our next football Sunday!   The rest of our meal was still great. The Big Wac was very filling and the BBQ sauce on the Sammie was to die for (vinegary and sweet and smoky). Animal fries were a good side but I'm sure we would've been happy with any of the others!  Can't wait to come back! Also, the service was great and staff were patient and helpful. :)"}
{"text":"We found this place on Thrillest and my salad is delicious (Thee Fighting Artichoke).  1st time here.   *Service was fast  **Food is fresh and healthy  ***Would come back again"}
{"text":"First trip out and super happy with the food. We ordered the balsamic picnic salad and the singapore tofu. Both were excellent. The strawberries were ripe and flavorful and the dressing was done well. The tofu was crispy and tasty and the rice noodles were perfect. Service was a little aloof, but hey aloof is better than pushy, rude, or absent. Definitely going back and definitely telling all my peeps about it. MM-MM good."}
{"text":"It's hard not to fall in love with this place, whether you're vegan or not! I've been coming here for a few years now. I'm vegetarian so hands down it's one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.   The food is great. It's truly a vegan/vegetarians dream - comfort food, vegan style! And although it's vegan it still taste amazing! So flavorful!  Recently they changed their menu up, which I'm pretty bummed about. The sandwiches no longer come with a side and they changed a few sandwiches and got rid of one of my favorites - the No Harm Chicken Parm :( whyyyy!?  Although, they did add a new sandwich, the BFF. Let me just say, it makes up for my old fav. The BFF is a mock chicken sandwich and it is so good. The mock chicken breading was crunchy and crispy. There's avocado on it. I subbed the jalapeños for Cholula hot sauce. And then there ranch sauce. Ahhh, I'm getting hungry thinking about it! That along with the chili cheese fries and I'm in heaven.   Another bad change, the kids meals. They now include a side and the price went way up. $8 for the mock chicken nuggets and $9 for a plain veggie burger...you gotta be kidding me! Although, I still bought it for my little ones lol.  What can I say, I'll always love this place."}
{"text":"Food was really good to excellent.  Service was slow.  Moderately enrage you slow.  I went to Green on a Thursday at 12:15 and ordered the following to-go:  1.  Crab puffs (meh. decent but not memorable.) 2.  Ranchero salad (not remotely spicy, but good texture on the wings and a great assortment of veg. Ranch dressing was pretty tasty.) 3.  Big WAC (I could eat this every day and die enormously fat and happy. I made moaning noises whilst eating to the horror of my lunch mates.) 4. Secret BBQ chicken sandwich (lunchmate who is a pretty die hard meat eater enjoyed it. Said the BBQ was good, texture was fine \"but definitely not chicken.\") 5.  Iced tea (I drank at least 5 glasses. So tasty and fresh!)  It took 45 minutes to get my TO-GO order. No apologies given. Other people came in, ordered, ate and left while I was still waiting. Place was crazy busy. Everyone looked happy though. I think my experience was an anomaly.   Bottom line, I will definitely be going back. Much more to try!"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to religiously when I'm feeling like eating healthy. Being a pesceterian, I frequently get meat cravings, and GREEN is the place I run to. Their mock chicken is delicious, tasted just like real chicken, and their version of the Big Mack the \"Big Wack\" is even tastier than the real thing, from what I can remember! I absolutely recommend the spicy peanut chicken salad, it is so filling and full of flavor. To whoever judges vegan food as \"cardboard- like and tasteless\" needs to try Green. I have gotten several of my omnivorous friends to try this place and they have all loved the food and the atmosphere. Its very artsy-fartsy inside, and when you walk in you immediately feel the positive vibes bouncing off all the healthy people inside. Its really really nice overall. The location is a little hidden, but nevertheless, when you find the place you will always go back!  STAY GREEN!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere.  I had thai Peanut bowl and my wife had the \"chicken\" swarma.  They were both delious and filling.  When you go try the tsoynami deserts. Very nice to have on a hot day."}
{"text":"I've been a vegan now for about 15 years and have eaten at every possible vegan friendly establishment I could find in my travels.  I can honestly say with no hesitation that in terms of good old comfort food done vegan that Green leaves every other place I've eaten at in the dust. This includes every restaurant frequented while living in Portland, OR which to many is some kind of vegan mecca.   Get the Big Wac. Best vegan burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful, and I love the secret BBQ sandwich with french fries. many non-veg eaters will enjoy this spot."}
{"text":"This place was super busy so be prepared to order so that the line keeps moving! We ordered a Thai peanut bowl with fake beef and the buffalo \"wings\". Both dishes came really quickly and the portions were very large. There were tons of fresh veggies in our bowl, and it definitely had quite a kick. A lot of water and the ranch sauce from our wings helped to curb the spice. There is plenty of seating inside and outside, and the bathrooms are clean and gender neutral. There are also many vegan products for sale such as cookie dough, marshmallow fluff, and chocolate syrup. Truly a vegan paradise."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything I have tried is incredible! I love the spicy buffalo wings! The only thing that would make it better would be delivery service"}
{"text":"I have been here before and I enjoy my experiences. I thought I would write a review. We went around 6 p.m., the place is consistent with a nice atmosphere. The staff was very nice and good customer service. The wait was not long to order and have our food served. I ordered the usual, buffalo wings. They are delicious. The price is not bad at all. The tables were full so we sat on the tables outside. I think some music and some water mists would be a great addition. Other than that I will be back."}
{"text":"Mmmm...  I finally made it to Green for lunch today.  I'd been once before but only had a drink - not sure why it took me so long to return.  But now that I've eaten there, I'll gladly return anytime!  I really enjoyed my Balsamic Picnic Salad.  (Toasted organic pecans, apples, strawberries and  figs over fresh greens tossed in a homemade  balsamic syrup.) Delicious!  I went with the large version and ate it all!  I also shared an order of thyme fries although my lunch companion and I agreed that we couldn't taste the thyme...  I noticed there were a bunch of fun and unique vegan products for sale including some sweet treats that looked damn good.  Service was friendly and efficient (thanks Stevie).  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. The owner, Damon, is a genius! His creations are unique, delicious and cruelty-free. Whether you eat meat or not, this place is BOMB. Check it out!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. The owner, Damon, is a genius! His creations are unique, delicious and cruelty-free. Whether you eat meat or not, this place is BOMB. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I always try to hit up the most popular veg restaurants whenever I travel, but nothing compares to the food and atmosphere at Green. I'm so happy that the best veg restaurant on earth is in my own city. The Big Wac, Wendy's Pickle and Blackjack Pita are a few of my favorites, but everything on the menu is pretty delicious. And don't forget to grab a treat next door at Nami after your meal!"}
{"text":"A vegan and vegetarian paradise. Hands down my favorite place to eat at. I've tried most things on the menu and I'd have to say the BFF is my winner with sauteed jalapenos, avocado, cheddar, ranch, ontop of mock chicken. Its also a blast to give their mock meat to carnivores, who usually wouldn't give meat substitutes a second of their time, and see how conflicted they are because they're so damn good. Proves that vegan and vegetarian lifestyles don't have to be boring!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! My favorite is the Ranchero Wrap & animal fries. Only con is the parking is very limited & the employees aren't friendly most the time. Sad because I really thought it would be a cool welcoming atmosphere....  But as long as you sit outside or just as far away from the counter where people order food ( it gets really crowded & employees are constantly trying to get through to deliver food)  you should have a nice visit."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food! Their meat substitutes are solid but I'm not a veg and ultimately would rather just have meat. But when eating out with the veggie friends, this is a great option for everyone. I've had the drunken Mongolian and the Thai peanut bowls. Both are good!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently amazing! I used to be a vegetarian so this was a go to place for me! Now that I am back to eating meat I still frequent this awesome vegan restaurant. The BBQ sand which is amazing and would fool any meat lover. My favorite is the Singapore Orange bowl with mock chicken. Also, try the Soy yogurt for dessert!"}
{"text":"I really really love Green's menu. Just because you are vegan/veg it doesn't mean you have to eat healthy boring food all the time. My favs include their buffalo 'chicken' sandwich, apricot miso noodle bowl and 'crab' puffs. I wish I had their recipe for the fake chicken, it is aaaamzing. Servings are large on the sandwiches and slightly smaller on the noodle bowls. Their iced tea is also really good not surprisingly. The food here has been consistently good and it is definitely my spot to hit up when I am in the valley. I really would like to try the 'wings' as well as other sandwiches, I guess I need to visit AZ more."}
{"text":"Sadly this restaurant quality of food is terrible.. always burnt frys  and the customer service is terrible.. when are they going to produce good quality food.. we found hairs in our food .. this is not a place I would recommend for vegan food"}
{"text":"SIMPLY, THE BEST! That is right. Hopefully, the song is running in your head as you read this review. My veggie friends all raved about Green when I moved here many moons ago. I am not one to buy into hype, but I definitely wanted to give it a try. I have now been there over 2 million times! Well, actually, more like a few dozen, but still, as many as I have been able to squeeze in. I take my veggie friends from far and wide, and they also fall in love with this place. I even brought my meat eating boss back a bar-b-que sandwich from here once, and he loved it! If you knew him - one of those guys that thinks anything labeled vegetarian is tasteless and disgusting - you would know what a big deal that is.  The food here is always wonderful. They have a great variety, and their unique inventions are always good too. I am a fan of bar-b-que, and their bar-b-que sandwich is delicious! It is as good as any bar-b-que I remember eating as a child when society forced me to eat the flesh of Earth's beautiful creatures. OK, I am being a bit dramatic. I would eat animal flesh bar-b-que with the zeal of a wild beast back then, and love it. But now I know better, and Green provides me the exquisite flavor of bar-b-que I loved as a beastly, carnivorous child without the need to murder innocents!  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I greatly enjoy their food.  I should mention, I do not mind the dining experience, but I suppose, from reading the other reviews, some may. You do have to stand in line to order your food, and at times, they can get very busy. So it might take some time to get your food. However, it has never taken a ridiculous amount of time, and most often it takes only a few minutes.  Luckily, I have had the pleasure of dining here with some great friends, and we always have no problem entertaining each other. Vegetarians are very intelligent, and some of the most interesting people I have met. My girlfriend is a carnivore, and she often has a hard time keeping up. I think grease congeals in their minds and slows everything down. JK! She is brilliant and beautiful, and she loves the food too.  Sorry if my review has been a bit silly and off point at times, but just thinking about Green makes me giddy. If you have not done so, I hope you visit them and enjoy the place as much as I do."}
{"text":"Was amazing my husband had the Thai peanut bowl and I had the Jamaican Brussels sprout wrap.(I can't remember the menu name)Both were delicious. Parking is difficult here but well worth it. Service was limited but very good!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't need my five star review... the 4.5 star overall rating with 900 reviews on Yelp already says enough.  However, the concept and food here is so good that I just had to add an extra 5-star to the pile.  I opted for the Big Wac on my first day eating here, along with Buffalo Wings and a side of fries.  Everything was so good that I came back for lunch before heading to the airport to leave town.  On my second trip I got the BFF (fried chicken sandwich) and fries.  I travel extensively for work and have eaten at vegetarian/vegan restaurants all over the country.  This is one of the best ones I've ever been to.  It reminds me of Hip City Veg in Philly, if anyone has ever been there, but feels less like fast food and more like a cafe.  This is the type of vegan restaurant that you bring your carnivore friends to.  This is the type of place that makes them say \"Oh... this actually tastes good!\"  This is the type of place that has you asking \"How do they do it?\"  This isn't one of those vegetarian places that tries to be too healthy.  It serves burgers, milk shakes, and fried \"chicken\" sandwiches, but it is all delicious, and sometimes you want to indulge in a bacon cheeseburger with mayo - vegan style!  I highly recommend the place... check it out, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Second time there. Came back for the Big Wac as it was obviously cooked fresh the first time. Unfortunately this time my wife and I both ordered it with a side of their animal fries. All was very obviously precooked and very dry. Too bad as we are both vegans and eat out so infrequently. I would always be happy to wait for fresh food but it seems they were sandbagging the burgers and fries to stay ahead of the rush. Good idea for the cooks ticket time but that's about it. Still 3 stars as I appreciate the effort and it was good the first time."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Delicious! I just wish it was closer to my house. Other than that, I have no complaints. The price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great. Couldn't ask for anything else!"}
{"text":"In a corner of a strip mall lays a vegan/vegetarians dream.     This is the place to be... I can get a burger with Big Mac sauce and fries all without MEAT!   Are you kidding me, this place is incredible. My girlfriend and I order the kids burger with fries.  Woohoo!  WHAT!!! You can order from the kids meal menu....  Oh yeah, let's not forget about my fried Brussels sprouts..... DELICIOUS.....   The burger was great it's a soy base protein burger.... listen it's not the real deal but if you really dress it up... add lettuce, caramelized onions, slice tomatoes and vegan mayo and ketchup....it truly is a great substitute.  All of us want to improve our lives so why not start with what we eat.   Give this place a try... you might be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the espresso BBQ sauce, so the potabella sandwich on wheat bun really hit the spot.  The hubby had the singapore orange bowl with rice and mock chicken, he said the flavors were really good (other than the mock chicken, it was his 1st experience with mock chicken and he is a real chicken fan, so you can't blame green for that)   Good prices too :)"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this restaurant. It has a nice and casual indoor and outside area, friendly staff and a menu with just the right variety at a very affordable price point. This place does not disappoint! My favorite is the Thai Peanut rice bowl and the Chips and Hummus. So delicious. I am a fan now and I will keep supporting them."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Service was courteous and prompt.  The salad I had was the best I've ever eaten.  I also tried the chili-cheese fries and they were very good.  The drinks were really good too.  I wish Green were in my hometown."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for vegan food. What I like about this place is the originality when compared to many other vegan restaurants I have been to. Their sandwiches and appetizers are amazing. My non- vegan friends loved it too.  The restaurant has a very casual ambience and cuisine ranges a mix of American to Asian fusion.  The best part is that they have some amazing soft serve ice creams and milkshakes. I notice that many visitors come here just for the desserts.  My only recommendation - I wish they had smaller sizes for their sundaes and desserts, I never order them because they are so big for one person :( However, that's probably a good thing if you are only looking to get their desserts ;)"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty. I had the green lemon plate and it taste amazing. The service however it's poor and the cashier is an ass. It was my first time eating here and she make it quite hard. I didn't tip her!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I, from San Diego, went to a Jiu Jitsu tournament in Phoenix and were looking for Vegan places. We ended up coming here two days in a row and ordering almost every sandwich they have and three or four Tsoynamis(sp?), everything was wonderful.  This restaurant was the deciding factor in using traveling 10 hours round trip the next weekend for another Phoenix area torunament. We came here twice again. We tried the rest of the sandwiches, including the turkey pesto artichoke special wrap, and a few more tsoynamis.   If this place was in San Diego I'd quit my job to work here."}
{"text":"The Tempe site is bigger than the Phoenix site, which made for a more cozy atmosphere. Lastly, the bbq Sammie was delish."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place when I was in town for a wedding a Yelp'd \"vegan\".  I wish that it was in Orange County.    The food was great.  I had \"Thee green salad\" and some samosas.  It was easily enough food for two people, but I knew I would never be coming back so I wanted to try a few things.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and the flavor profile was very well put together.  The samosas were cooked to flaky, perfection."}
{"text":"Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My \"Artichoke dip\" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My 'eggless eggrolss\" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Was here for Smunch.  Let me get the one bad thing out of the way: the parking lot stinks.  While there are lots of fake meat options, which several in our party had, I went with stir fried vegetables and fried tofu on rice. It was really good.  Nobody in our group disliked their meal.  The people are really friendly and the service was good.  It is fast casual so you order at the counter.  Because it is not standard fare for most folks they can all answer questions about what ingredients are in each dish."}
{"text":"I love this place!   I've been to Green about five times since I've first had it in April. For all of you vegans or vegetarians who cook a lot of your meals at home, this place is a satisfying getaway from the kitchen. I wouldn't eat here every day of the week because I love preparing my meals and saving money, but Green is a lovely treat!  As for customer service, I have no complaints! The employees are welcoming and always deliver your food within 10 minutes of ordering.   I recommend the Singapore Orange bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. It's delicious! Treat yourself to an almond milkshake for dessert.   You'll leave full and happy :)"}
{"text":"So tasty I ate here twice when I was in Phoenix only two days.  They have a separate menu that lists gluten free options, which was nice.  I loved the selection of sweet limeade, berry lemonade and some tea beverages that come with free refills.  The artichoke gratin dip was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Meet up with some friends for dinner, one being a vegan, and Green was the place suggested, and I was looking forward to checking them out.  I bet you're thinking a meat eater wouldn't find anything good or filling at a Vegetarian/Vegan place, but I'm here to let you know, you can! And you will walk away full and liking the meal you just had!  After checking out the menu, I went with Thai Peanut bowl, right of the bat I knew I loved spicy peanut sauces, so this was up my alley, and it comes with pan fried noodles (you can get rice too if that's your thing) sautéed veggies and I picked mock chicken to go with mine, but since I wasn't sure if I would like the mock chicken, I asked for it on the side.  When the dish arrived, it looked like a great stir-fry bowl, it didn't scream vegan at all.  The mock chicken, to me looked like and had the texture of chicken nuggets, but were better tasting, I was kind of disappointed I asked for them on the side, instead of the dish so they could get saucy,  but next time I'll know.  This was a great meal, everything tasted great including the mock chicken. Glad to have tried Green, I also like that Green is Vegan restaurant that offers comfort food.   Looking forward to trying out more dishes for sure!"}
{"text":"You gotta love Green's take on vegetarian cuisine.   I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan or anything else but I do love good clean food. Green serves up delicious meals that make you forget this is not a traditional restaurant. The decor and staff also add to the experience. This spot is on my rotation for easy dinner options in south Scottsdale.   Tip: try the Big Wac or one of the rice bowls on your first trip."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. My general tsaos v-chicken was the right amount of spice but had a slightly burnt aftertaste I wasn't bothered enough to complain, but it did bring this from a 5 star to a 4. Friendly staff and an abundance of options as long as you like Asian food. Burger and fry people should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let's just say that every time I make a trip to phoenix I must stop by Green! This place is positively fantastic. There is honestly nothing on this menu that has ever let me down. I especially love their black jack pita! Prices are a little higher than the college budget, however their customer service is nothing short of exceptional. This vegan/vegetarian joint has something for everyone in your party. Get there early because this place fills up fast and for good reason. See you next time Green!"}
{"text":"We've always loved the Tempe location, and this one is also a great addition.  Got the jerk tofu salad, hubby got the diablo bowl--both were as good as always. Would have liked more 'stuff'' in my salad (only has greens, carrot shavings and tortilla strips along w/the tofu) but it was my fault for not asking more to be added.  Service was awesome; one girl in particular was especially jovial, helpful, always smiling and very personable. Another at the counter looked like she just swallowed a lemon and acted irritated or just rude at the mere asking for a condiment.  Maybe she was having a bad day...  Overall we love Green and plan to come back when we're downtown again. The location is artsy and nice, limited parking is tricky but we made it work. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what they claim to be.....vegan comfort food.  Went with my mom who was visiting from out of town.  The Big Wack tasted just like a Big Mac...and the thyme fries were thin and crispy and perfect!  The tahini coleslaw was also very good.  The Calexico burger was good, but not as good as the Big Wack.  We also had the artichoke gratin.  Good, but probably wouldn't order it again.  We had lunch there again the following day because there were other menu items we wanted to try, and were we're so full from our burgers the previous day that we didn't have room for a soynami.  This time we tried the Singapore orange bowl with house tofu and brown rice, and the Kung pow with house tofu and noodles.  Both were really good, but the Singapore orange was better, as was he rice.  Lots of veggies and tofu cooked perfectly.  We even had room to share a soynami made with homemade vegan kit kats and chocolate syrup.  It was really good...although the kit kat could have been chopped smaller.  All in all, really yummy.  Not health food by any means....and quite salty, but yummy still."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! I took my daughter who has been vegetarian for 6 years. We went for the vegan Big Mac called the Big Wac. We both loved it! She said it was exactly as she remembered a Big Mac tasting, nay, better!  What a great place to indulge without compromising your values and beliefs. I have read some reviews claiming how unhealthy this place is for Vegan food. I think that's hilarious! Anything vegan is a healthier option than the \"real thing\" any day of the week! I don't know about you, but I don't eat French fries because I think they're healthy. I eat it once in a while because they're delicious duh! I can't express how impressed we were with the quality and creativity of this place. I have had vegan and vegetarian food for years. Even though I am a carnivore through and through, this is now one of my favorite places. That says a lot, trust me!"}
{"text":"This vegan place is two things - simply delicious and totally casual.  They also rigidly adhere to their stated closing times - so you need to get there well before.  We  eat there at least once a month and with all the guests we've brought and our wanderings around the menu can state nothing is bad.  Of course you'll develop your own favorites."}
{"text":"We were excited to find a vegan restaurant, so we've given it a chance several times.  The food is very good, but almost every time I go I end up feeling not-so-great later that day.  Not sure if I'm choosing the wrong items,  but even my husband has the same problem.  I do LOVE their burger and soynamis so sometimes I go and take the risk.  If your a veghead, it's a definite must-try."}
{"text":"I just made the switch to vegetarianism a few months ago, and have been scouting out some decent cuisine when I stumbled on Green today.  I ordered the Spicy Po Boy, and damn if it wasn't the best Po Boy I've ever had!!!  (vegan or otherwise).  Casual unassuming atmosphere with a bit of a beatnick vibe.  I will definitely be going back to try the \"Drunken Chicken\" along with a Tsoymami desert!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! One of the best vegan places ever! I had the Big Wack that was so much better than a Big Mac! Fresh and flavorful with a beautiful bunch of fries. The place is small and adorable. The staff are friendly, hard working and polite. Oh! And their bottled beverage selection is surprisingly kitschy. They serve local canned beer as well! I would recommend this place for a quick and quiet lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent option in a sea of big boxes and chain restaurants.  The vegan \"thing\" is not as rare as it used to be in this Valley, but doing it well still is. These people rock"}
{"text":"Green was a breath of fresh air while I was visiting my sister in Phoenix, being a Seattlite and all. I was afraid I'd have a difficult time finding a vegetaraian friendly- let alone- vegetarian restaurant in a town that is chock-full of fast-food chains.  The Phoenix-area has come a long way!   I had the Coconut Curry rice bowl which was pretty good and a bite of my friends \"Chicken\" Parm, which was also tasty. But I have to say, the Spicy Buffalo \"wings\" are what stole my heart!   I was a bit disappointed the menu was quite limited. I am allergic to nuts and there were a lot of dishes with nuts and I am also gluten-free, so I felt limited. I didn't eat a lot of comfort foods prior to becoming vegetarian like \"chili fries\" and \"burgers\" so I can understand some cynicism of Green gravitating toward these menu options."}
{"text":"Just had my first lunch at Green, and I'm completely stuffed, and deliriously happy! The food is awesome, and I kept forgetting that it was all Vegan! I had the black jack pita, which was great. They added artichokes to the wrap, and it was filling and had tons of great flavor. The only thing I didn't get was the thyme fries. I didn't taste the thyme. That being said, I didn't go there for the fries. James shared his Big Wac with me, and I wished I had ordered the same. It's all in the sauce, it tastes like a real-deal Big Mac.   To drink, I wanted to try their Berry Lemonade, and it was the perfect summer drink. I also tried the Lime. Very tasty, and not as sweet as the lemonade. I'll get that one again for sure. For our after lunch treat, we shared a Peanut Butter bar, and an incredible Tsoynami shake. Both were amazing, we were impressed at how well each item was prepared. I need to take better care next time, because I could very easily pack on the pounds at this place.  I will definitely go back to this place. Hopefully next week!"}
{"text":"This was our first time checking out a vegetarian restaurant after cutting meat from our diet two months ago. This is the type of place that makes you wonder why you would ever need animal based products. We had animal fries, eggless rolls, and the dragon rice bowl with \"chicken\" and everything was fantastic. I will admit the vegan cheddar cheese looked a little scary, but it was delicious, don't be afraid"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Friendly staff, cool atmosphere, and most importantly, tasty vegan food! I love the \"chicken wings\" and \"hamburgers\" the most. Yes, I miss the real stuff and this place tastes like the real thing! I also like their salads."}
{"text":"Best ever!!! Really. The wings are to die for. The hamburger made all my non-vegetarian friends envious.  The food comes out quick. The service is also very responsive. I just love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Oh wow, love this place!  I have attended their ThanksLiving event for the last two years and have a great time enjoying delicious fake turkey (made from seiten and breaded), side dishes, and yummy desserts. Plus, the proceeds go to the Humane Society.    Besides ThanksLiving, this place has faux meat down! Many of my meat-eating friends say that the fake meat is just as delicious with a very similar mouthfeel as the meat they're imitating.  I have ordered salads, stir-fries, and the desserts here and have loved everything.  The stir fry vegetables are cooked to perfection - not too overcooked and crispy but not too raw still. The place can get packed on weekends and evenings, though, so sometimes finding a table can be a problem.  If one chooses an off time, it's usually no problem.   Besides the slowish service, I haven't been superimpressed with the cashiers."}
{"text":"Funky little spot on 7th street with friendly servers and excellent food!   I enjoyed Green in Tempe and was excited when the Phoenix location opened.   Parking: This is one problem area of this location. Parking is tight.  There is likely street parking around the area.   Service with a smile: The employees are always friendly.    Food: Amazing!  This is vegetarian comfort food.  I have ordered almost every salad and bowl on the menu. Some veg-based places skimp on flavor and spice, but Green knows what it is doing!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. My favorite is the windows pickle but you seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Every time I have ever gone I have received quality food with customer service to match."}
{"text":"I am not a VEGAN (I love meat) but wanted to try this place with a friend. Good variety on the menu & is was good.  Place is very small with limited seating. And the music was too loud you couldn't even hear the cashier."}
{"text":"Surpassed all expectations. I had the big WAC and my jaw dropped as soon as I bit into it. Tasted just like a Big Mac from McDonald's. I also had the chicken wings appetizer which was incredibly tasty as well. I'm already planning a return to this place again cuz they have so many other tantalizing items on their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. All the food had great flavor. The service seems slightly unorganized but everyone is friendly. I'm not sure what coffee they use but it was delicious."}
{"text":"So, I'm from Chicago and my biggest food upset right now is that Green New American Vegetarian is 1,753.2 miles away from me.  My partner and me visited Green's on our way to the mountains (oh, I don't like this name for a restaurant BTW and I don't even care because the food is so delicious).  I got the chicago cheesesteak.  She got the big WAC.  We went back and ordered 4 more meals to take with us on our trip - screw going to the grocery store and cooking stuff over the fire.  As fun as that is, Green's food is so delicious, we weren't interested in anything else or trying to recreate this deliciousness from scratch over a campfire.  I'm so glad we got more to go.  The chicago cheesesteak we roasted over the campfire that night was even better than what I had in the restaurant.    Then on our way back north to Sedona, we went out of our way to go back to Green's and get more food to go.  Honestly, we didn't get enough to go and fought over it several hours later (although I'm not sure there will ever be enough).  I'm stirred up by my experience at Green's.  Their chicago cheesesteak is better than any chicago cheesesteak I ever had back in my meat eating days.  That means there's like 3 million Chicagoan's eating cows in the form of cheesesteaks that aren't even as good as cow free cheesesteaks.  That's just stupid.  It's not worth the cow.    I'm trying to figure out how to get Green's food here in Chicago.  Can I just order it?  Have it frozen and shipped?  Should I open a Green's New American Vegetarian here in Chicago, on my block, so I can eat it whenever I want?  Maybe.  I've been avoiding writing this because now I want a big WAC, a cheesesteak, a karma curry, a peanut chicken... and they are 1,753.2 miles away from me."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now, and really enjoyed each meal. My husband and I each twice had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich (vegan mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in espresso BBQ sauce with vegan mayo, $8). I most recently enjoyed the \"Argentine\" po-boy (strips of seitan mock steak sauteed with caramelized peppers and onions, vegan mayo and a spicy chimichuri sauce, $8). I usually get fresh fruit as a side to my sandwiches; my husband gets fries. Their fair-trade green tea is also very good. Whole grain rolls would be the only improvement I would suggest for the sandwiches.  The decor is early college student, but we'll continue to return for the delicious vegan food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good restaurant, the food's good, etc. All in all not too shabby, except the customer service aspect is kind of *pulls shirt collar*. I bought a kombucha and I'm not gonna lie, this is my bad, but I opened it too quickly and it got all over the table. And I was all embarrassed and all that and my fiance and I looked around for where we could find napkins and there weren't any, so I told the waitress nearest by and she was like \"Did you shake it?\" (all condescendingly, like I've never consumed a carbonated drink before) and I was like \"No\" and she was like \"You can grab another one.\" and walked away and i'm just like still sitting here with kombucha all over my table lol. Like damn, Okay (= I work in food service and I get irritated at customers, but I don't just straight dismiss them like that. That's nasty. Thankfully another guy could help me out with a rag."}
{"text":"Best vegan fries in town! Add a shake and meatless burger and you will be feeling the American pride with none of the American guilt!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian nor do pretend to be, but this place is pretty tasty for vegetarian fast food.  The mainstay is the Big Wac.  Two NON beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese.  The bun is tasty.  the flavor is similar to what I remember of a Big Mac.    Also had the cheese steak.  The imitation steak was well imitation, but it was still good in its own right.  For starters, the Ranchero Salad.  This was OK.  Veggies fresh.  The 'wings' were a little on sweeeter side.  Sadly, the sandwiches do not come with sides.  Overall, this is a solid spot for a vegetarian bite."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, and a great menu. This is my first vegan restaurant visit since moving to AZ. It's great to know that I can find treats like in the area. I hope they get more GF options as I would love to have a Big Wac too."}
{"text":"I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong!  The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Really good! I love the house made tofu. The tsoynamis are my favorite too! (The rocky road with marshmallow fluff is amazing!) I am not vegan but I love the noodle bowls.   My only recommendation-- don't get anything to go! They stuff it in a tiny Chinese food container and the portion is much smaller than if you order it in person."}
{"text":"I really used to love this place but they are changing and not for the better. The quality of the food is not the same plus they have went up on prices of the meals slightly and removed the sides that come with the meal. For marketing purposes this is horrible, your better off raising the prices slightly but leaving the sides with the meal.  The ladies and gentleman that provide service there are AWESOME and this needs to be mentioned because you will always get great service! I will still be getting breakfast occasionally  from their sister place NAMI but I am retiring from Green Vegetarian for now."}
{"text":"I walked in last month on a whim and have become a regular; I am not in any sense a Vegan. However, the food is scrumptious, the service is excellent, and it is very good for my health. The space is very comfortable , open, and minimal. Lots of natural light.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best vegan restaurant in Phoenix/Tempe. It's a jewel! They need to open more locations!  The only drawback is the name... try Googling \"Green\" when you're trying to find this place. I even had a hard time finding it on Yelp to write a review! I'm just saying...  Not the healthiest spot, despite the animal-free fare... But a good place to bring a non-vegan if they're trepidatious  about trying veggie food.  Try the vegan version of the DQ Blizzard called the \"Soynami\", the Buffalo Wings are INSANEly delicious, and don't be afraid to sample a special. They always have something creative and pallate-pleasing on the chalkboard."}
{"text":"This place has food that is absolutely delicious. I love their  Big WAC Burger, in fact all of their burgers are incredible. Then, go next door to Nami's next door for creamy and tasty \"ice cream\" and doughnuts."}
{"text":"We had the Big WAC, omg just like the other sandwich we used to eat.  Loved it!!  Also, the animal fries are the bomb!!  We just need the recipe to the berry lemonade I need to make this at home."}
{"text":"The mock chicken here is bangin good.  Tastes almost like real chicken.  I'm not vegan but loved all the food here. Very flavorful and you don't feel guilty stuffing your face.  What is gluten?  No gluten here but all them sauce and spice is legit.  Checkout the berry lemonade, took a glass home to add to my vodka, very tasty.  Will make some vegan friends and bring them here soon."}
{"text":"I have been to both Green locations many times, and I do prefer this one just because there is always plenty of parking here.   I have always had great experiences with the customer service here, and my food is always made correctly which I appreciate.   The inside is always well kept, and the staff are incredibly friendly as well.   As far as the food goes, most of the things I've had have been good. The kids chicken nuggets, though, were not the greatest. They were very soggy and lacking flavor. The animal fries, surprisingly, were not the best either. The sauce was good but the cheese was not. In my experience, pretty much everything else besides those things on the menu is great.  Overall, I definitely plan on coming in again and I recommend it to anyone who wants to try vegan food."}
{"text":"My 6-year old argued with his 10-year old brother that his \"chicken\" nuggets were real chicken. So it passed the kiddo test. Awesome food. Great environment. Craft beers. Win!"}
{"text":"I love the this restaurant they have the best food in town. I love there big wac and there spicy wing dings. I also love there salads. The Services, is wonderful."}
{"text":"Cute, casual cafe. Good food, though they forgot to bring me my soy ice cream at the end of my meal. Interesting car parts on the wall."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food is always good and it's reassuring to know it's 100% vegan."}
{"text":"Relatively new to the vegan environment so I'm always in search of options, especially when traveling. Kudos to Green, veggie burger and tahini salad was probably one of the best I've had. Even if you not on the vegan trip :-) this place is worth trying out."}
{"text":"I love this place! Kind and informative staff, amazing food that vegans, vegetarian, and meat eaters a like can all enjoy! It's fun they have wine and beer as well! I had the spicy wings and chili cheese fries! I went back again and got the same thing it was so good! Next time I'll try a burger and I want to try the vegan dessert place too! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great experience! The place is nice and clean and the food was amazing! I got the coconut curry mock chicken bowl and my husband got the \"Big Wac\"... He loved it! It strangely tasted just like a Big Mac. The fries were delicious as well. The parking lot was a little small and cramped, so you might have to wait a bit to park if it's busy."}
{"text":"As with the other location--drool. Like all the reviews say, Big Wac--and if you aren't carnivorous, you'll be welcomed with open arms here. They have a litany of strange teas ( basil cucumber, anyone? ) and plenty of other things to keep your mind from straying towards the objective at hand: a cheap meal that will keep you satisfied.   This particular location also has a chalk board that some genius writes hilarious sayings and references on. The last time I went, there was a Nami dedicated to twin peaks, Agent Cooper reference and all. Doesn't take too much to get me, and this got me. Hard."}
{"text":"Big wac, Big wac, Big wac. Just remember to say that to the person behind the counter and you will find yourself in a happy place.  This is a true vegan/vegetarian restaurant that caters to any sort of dietary restriction (except of course if you're a carnivore).   Most places are scared of not having a meat option on the menu, because they think it would drive away customers. Well this place is bustling most hours of the day, as is the companion dessert-shop Nami right next door. As with most places in this area it can be sometimes challenging to find a place to park, but if you're crafty it shouldn't be too hard.   You could also try the Calexico burger, that was tasty as well.  The staff are always cool here, if a bit hipster (hell, I suppose the whole place has that kind of vibe but it certainly feels less judgmental than say...Cartel Coffee).   I'll be a customer forev."}
{"text":"I have to say my bf food was good. He got the chili cheese fries and a Chicago cheese steak. My son got just plain fries and I got an artichoke salad. For me it's hard to find place to eat thats vegan/vegetarian and accommodating to wheat, corn, and soy allergies. So when asked for gluten free option they told me everything is on a shared grill. Now to me that's not gluten free, they are cross contaminating their food. I break out in hives eating any of these ingredients. Also, the little chips that you ask for the gluten free option they give you corn chips. So I didn't really eat my salad. Kind of a disappointment. So if you have food allergies I would suggest not eating there because of the shared grill of all their food. Too bad."}
{"text":"Vegetarian/vegan awesomeness.  Their flatbread pizzas are delicious, as are their noodle bowls.  I think i've sampled most things on their menu and they still keep me coming back for more.  Even meat-eating friends enjoy Green!"}
{"text":"I only wish they had longer hours! And brought back the mock duck sauce for the crab puffs! But this place is simply amazing."}
{"text":"My first visit...Big Wac, thyme fries, and mashup (carrot cake, chocolate chips, rice crispies, chocolate/vanilla swirl \"ice cream\"). Seriously an awesome meal!!!!"}
{"text":"The Jerk Tofu salad was delicious and I left feeling satisfied and healthy. Prices were very reasonable. I wish there was a restaurant like Green in my area!!"}
{"text":"It's a shame I can't give negative stars based on service. I was served horribly cold food!  Called an order in at 7:09p and was told my order would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I got there and paid at about 7:35, by 7:55 I have been watching the cashier flirt with every girl that comes in for half an hour and my food is still not ready. I watch countless people come and go as I am standing nearly directly in front of him. I see a bag on the shelf with multiple go boxes in it shortly after I had arrived. Finally at 8:02 he hands me that bag and I leave furious. I immediately open the bag to check the temperature, and am not at all surprised at ALL that the food is cold, dry and disgusting!!!! I spent 40:00 dollars here!! I have never been so mad at any restaurant. Absolutely NO excuse for this. I will be sharing this post on ALL of my social media and will be warming everyone I know about how horrible this experience was.  On a side note.. I sure the HELL marched right back in and demanded a refund. And the guy with the \"Scottish\" accent didn't seem to care at all. Shocking . Not!"}
{"text":"Big Wac & Thai Peanut rice bowl was excellent. Never thought I would love a mock meat ths much. Can eat this everyday"}
{"text":"Love this place!  My friend and I both ordered the thai peanut bowls with noodles.  I got the house tofu and she got extra veggies.  The thai peanut sauce was delicious with just the right amount of heat.    We arrived around 11:30 and the place was pretty emply but when we left around 12:30 all the tables were filled and the line was out the door.    I will definitely be back to try the Big Wac :)"}
{"text":"I love the food at green but would suggest the Tempe location as the customer service at the Phoenix location is appalling. If you do end up in Phoenix I'd suggest sticking with Nami next door."}
{"text":"So the atmosphere was cute, food was good, and reasonable prices and I would of given this restaurant a 4 or 5 - BUT my stomach is not agreeing with me!  My stomach has been rumbling and making noises for the past few hours since I ate lunch!  Ugh!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Service was TERRIBLE!!! I ordered online and waited 45 mins when I got there and it still wasn't done. The girl at the front said she would call my name when it was ready and that wasn't done either I had to continuously go to the counter and check. Don't go if you're on a time crunch. There is absolutely no sense of urgency AT ALL."}
{"text":"Green is one of the best places for vegetarian/vegan options in the area! Their menu is super diverse and it's great to have so many different options. My personal favorite is the BFF which has some great toppings. The first time I went I had the secret bbq sammie which was also amazing but a little messy. I really love sandwiches but I recently got the Ranchero salad  which was also good and much more filling than I expected. I cannot stop going back there and every time it's a struggle to pick just one thing to try! It's basically a vegan paradise and if you don't eat meat you need to check it out!   I originally went to the location in downtown phoenix before moving to Tempe and they are similar and the food is exactly the same. The Downtown location has a much different more artsy vibe and feels a little smaller. I do not love the Tempe locations outdoor seating because it's just a patio with a view of a parking lot and street."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes.  Some of my non-stand-bys are hit-or-miss, but this is the perfect comfort food for anyone on the meat-eating spectrum.   Note: do not read \"vegan\" as \"healthy\". It's comfort food, which means in all likelihood it is greasy, cheezy (with a z because it's not real cheese), and food-coma-inducing.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think the staff here is nicer than at the Scottsdale location.  You can easily drop $15 on a casual meal/drink/add-ons, which is my only beef (ba-dum-CHA) with this place. Ingredients are good, and the \"meat\" is all made in-house (none of that weird packaged, preservative stuff), so I don't think it's totally unreasonable. This place has a cult following and national veg cred for a reason.  HITS Original G Po Boy Big Wac No Harm Chicken Parm Cole slaw (peanut - can get it as a side with most sandwiches) Drunken Mongolian bowl Vegan Wings Peanut Tofu Chili fries Eggless rolls Mac and cheese (on the kids menu... try it WITH the wings. Uh-ma-zing.) Chicken tenders (also kids menu)  If there's a special, always get it, because 90% of the time, it will be your new favorite.  LESS OF A HIT Samosas Argentine po boy  Omnivore tested, vegan approved."}
{"text":"After about a month of being vegetarian, I was starting to feel sad about my lack of options at restaurants.  Enter Green.  Heaven, I can eat anything on the menu!!  An amazing feeling, I must say.  I've enjoyed the crab puffs, and the Mexican themed burger as well as some of the bowls.  It is reasonably priced, has a great mission (in my opinion) and not pretentious at all.  Love it- and I think it is a great place for veggies and non-veggies alike!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, even if you're not vegan! I love the Thai peanut bowl with vegan chicken, and Dagobah salad which was Jamaican jerk spiced Brussels sprouts over baby field greens with a creamy Jamaican dressing. There was a lot going on here, and every bit of it was good! The milkshakes are good too!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food is amazing and the folks who own it:::very cool.  If I lived in Tempe, i would eat here 3-4 times a week.  Anytime I visit AZ, I will eat here over and over and over ......."}
{"text":"We both had the Thai Peanut Veggie w/ Tofu bowl. Good, and loaded with veggies. They could have been cooked a tad longer though and then they would have received 4 stars.  The hummus was good and the pita chips were addictive.  Atmosphere is good and we like the music.  We would come back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere! Delicious food especially the Buffalo wings. I'd come back just for that anytime!!"}
{"text":"A vegan place with familiar flavors; don't get me wrong, I love new and interesting cuisine I just think this place will make veganity (is that a word?) accessible to more people.  RECOMMENDATION: Try the crab puffs and the secret bbq chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is defiantly a gem. The place is very cute and urban. I got the original \"g\" spicy po-boy and my boyfriend got the Thai peanut bowl. The sandwich was amazing if you like buffalo sauce but oh my... my boyfriends good way so much better. I would defiantly recommend this place for those who want to start their vegan journey!"}
{"text":"We visited on Thursday due to the reviews on Yelp. The parking lot is small but the food makes it worth it to deal with it. I got the Big Wac and fries and was in food heaven. I used to eat Big Macs, now that  I'm vegan I thought I would never have anything similar. This was even better than the Big Mac. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"stunning vegan grub!  The Big Wack is bar none my go to burger in AZ, maybe the earth.  Love the wings. Sauce is tangy, unique and totally delectable!  Always solid service and beautiful design and decor."}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting to try this place for months!  I'll start with the good...  I'm not a vegan by any stretch and I thought the food was phenomenal! I ordered the Singapore orange bowl with mock chicken and noodles...just wonderful! Seasoned well, fresh veggies, and the mock chicken was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to taste and feel fake, but the taste and texture was just like chicken!   My friend ordered the MAC and I swear it tasted exactly like a Big Mac from McDonald's! The thyme fries are delish as well!  To top it off I had a cookie dough Tsoynami...OMG...amazing. Like a blizzard that tasted and had the texture similar to mochi. I loved it.  So clearly the food is not the issue. I will come back despite the problems I'm about to list because the food is so good!  The bad...  I was not happy with the service I received. Not warm or friendly at all. I don't appreciate that smug hipster attitude. Sorry. And they don't serve a hot chai latte??? That was annoying. So I settled for tea and they forgot to give me my hot water and then acted annoyed when I asked for it.  My tea cup was dirty. It had lipstick on it. Hello, we are in the middle of a flu outbreak right now! Not happy about that.   It is expensive. $5 for some ice cream (the tsoynami)? You will not get your money's worth here.  Not many options if you can't have soy. It is in practically everything.  The food gave me horrible gas (sorry tmi). Not the fault of the place but just be aware if you're not used to vegan food. Maybe it was the mock chicken and/or tsoynami because I eat veggies all the time."}
{"text":"Ok...count me in the \"I'm not a vegan but this place was great\"  crowd!  Went and had lunch with some new friends  one is a vegetarian, so we thought we'd give it a try.......VERY GOOD and VERY reasonable... 5 appetizers for around $17 and 2 entrees with tea were around $22..  Between 6 of us, we tried the pizza, several of the bowls (apricot was awesome!),   edimame, Hummus, peanut thai tofu, artichoke dip, crab puffs, and 4 different desserts.  everything was wonderful!    the only negative in the entire meal was that our group thought the artichoke dip was runny but flavorful.   we got there for lunch right as they opened at 11 and were served first...the place was full very quickly after that.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and talked to us \"newbies\" at length about the menu, how to order, and what the vegan cheeses were like.  They even brought us samples of the ice cream to help us order! We will definitely be back, thanks for a great time and a great meal! Richard and the APS crowd:)"}
{"text":"This place is YUMMY! I used to be a Veggie and love the food still. I work downtown and have a ton of options for lunch but, I'm always wanting Green. I recommend the Thai Chicken Salad and the Po Boy Sandwich. The Po Boy is so SPICY but so bomb. You must go! I ordered the kid's chicken nuggets today and they are so good! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I absolutely love this place! I enjoy the variety of the menu and the atmosphere. Some of my favs include: Wendy's pickle, the big wac, and any of Asian inspired bowls."}
{"text":"Came in around 8:30 pm for desert, we had the chai tiramisu, the fruity tSoynamis and a 'make your own.' Without a doubt, amazing gf choices, dairy free treats.  My grandson love it and we're happy Green serves healthy alternatives!"}
{"text":"wowza.  this place could probably convert a Texas rancher to a vegan, the food is THAT GOOD.  I started with a yummy salad- greens with balsamic, dried figs, pecans & strawberry.  the \"small\" salad was a very good size. then had the apricot miso rice bowl with tons of veggie mock chicken.  incredible sauce, I would have licked the bowl, had the restaraunt not been full.    speaking of full, even though I WAS full at that point, I could not pass up the Soy-namis.  had a Ginger Snap & damn if I did not eat all 16 glorious ounces of it...  my belly is distended. it was worth it.  good thing I was wearing my platform peeptoe shoes when I showed up, this place is for young hipsters.  the vibe is young & cool (2 things I am not), but not in a snobby way. more grungy hip, if ya' know what I mean."}
{"text":"love love love. when I was in PHX last year, this location was not open, so I went to the OG outpost in Tempe.  this one is a lot more convenient.  had every possible meal at Green.  I have to take advantace of the vegan delish whenever I can.  main dishes I tried: Coconut curry w/ fake chicken, Mongolian fake beef & Thai fake chicken.  plus some salads & starters. and tasty housemade bevs.  everything there is AMAZING.  brought a veggie friend & an omni & they were huge fans, too!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of Vegetarian food that makes me think I could never eat meat again.  Its delicious, flavorful and healthy.  I had the Balsamic Picnic Salad, a tasty combination of fresh dark greens, figs, strawberries and tart green apples.  We also had the Green Hummus and Artichoke Gratine.  Yum!  I can't wait to go back!  I think next time I will definitely have to try the Tsoynami..."}
{"text":"Given that Green has 400+ reviews and four and a half out of five stars, I'm pretty sure everything that needs to be said, has been said.   Between my sister, her boyfriend, and myself, we had:  BBQ chicken pizza, Spicy Peanut noodle bowl with chicken, Crab Puffs, BBQ chicken sandwich, and my sister's boyfriend had a strawberry almond milkshake. For dessert, I had a chocolate almond milkshake and my sister had the Soy Captain Tsoynami.   We're still in a little shock that EVERYTHING we had was 100% vegan. The three of us are lactose intolerant; I kept on waiting to get sick off the milkshake but it never happened.   The only complaint I have is that a places like Green are few and far between. Literally. I live in San Diego (I only know of one other fully vegan place in my area), Green is in Tempe, AZ.   As an omnivore with a meatatarian streak, Green is allll kinds of super amazing."}
{"text":"Our very favorite restaurant in PHX and I am not even vegetarian!  We had the vegan breakfast of sausage and gravy and wow- amazing!"}
{"text":"Best vegan meal I have found!  I go here frequently and have the staff surprise me with the meals each and every time.  I have been here many times and I will continue going back.  The staff has been excellent each time and only once have I received a meal I didn't like.  I think I may have eaten each item off of the menu by now."}
{"text":"This is a really yummy place to eat! They just need more space. I really enjoyed the food and the employees were very nice!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a vegan nor am I a vegetarian. I actually love meat, dairy, and most things that come from animals. Having said that, Green absolutely blew me away. I never in a million years would have thought that I'd actually be reviewing a restaurant that only serves vegetarian/vegan options with such high praises, but here I am.   I love the whole \"comfort food\" thing they're going for. I got some egglessrolls to start and the diablo red bowl. Both were awesome. The atmosphere at this location was also really cool. Super friendly staff that were patient with me."}
{"text":"Went here after trying Nami for their brunch. Seriously great. I tried a Philly cheesesteak sandwhich, the bbq chicken wrap and the big wac burger. The big wac takes the cake out of the three with a close second for the bbq chicken wrap."}
{"text":"I ordered food to bring home. Everything was AMAZING!!!!!! This is the best vegan \"junk food\" I have every had. Seriously. Try it."}
{"text":"will not go back. when i visit asu  i always go to tsom or pomegranate cuz food is wonderful and great prices.  but today i decided to give this place a try.    i am a vegan who do not like fake meat. so i ordered the lemon and walnut bowl with brown rice. there was barely brown rice. and the veggies were all fillers veggies. ie zucchinis and carrots.   they put way too much oil which was a bummer cuz there was no rice to soak up. when i asked the guy how much rice do they put in a bowl he didnt know the answer. hmmmm. also the meal should have came with a lemon pinenut pesto sauce. ummm. i got lemon and oil sauce. i must have gotten a new new cook. what a shame."}
{"text":"*****Wanted to let all know this location is closed for remodeling. The other location off of 7th is open though.  Great food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Green, and will not be my last.  I really loved this place, and after hearing co-workers rave about it forever, I'm glad I decided to give them a try.  My only complaint is that you have to wait in what could potentially be a long line to order your food.  I would prefer to order at the table.  This would not be such a problem on their slower days, but when they're busy, be prepared to wait awhile to order.  Not a good thing when you are starving!  Other than that, I think this place is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. The mock chicken is great! Buffalo wings are flavorful and delicious! Try this place. Won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am neither a vegan nor vegetarian. But this place is something encourages you to be so. The food is so good and satisfying. The place is nice and clean and the vibes as well. I saw so many people are leaving no crumbs on their plates. They got inside and outside tables. It is safe to go on open days as well. I asked for my food to be Safari so I do not mess it up while I'm studying, and still got a nice representation and quantity. I got the semi chicken and the coleslaw salad and both were so good. I would come agin and bring friends to try new plates. There are many spots for the parking on the back. JThe one star missed for the bathroom only."}
{"text":"This place has great food , but to wait 45 + minutes for my food every time I come in . If it takes you an hour to open the kitchen I think you guys should open at 12 . But until this is fixed , I will not be supporting this establishment"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I came to AZ for a work training and I am the only vegan in the group so I had to go alone : ( I ordered a classic burger and animal fries. They were delicious and very filling. I will definitely be going back and my co-workers now wanna go since they saw how good my food looked."}
{"text":"This is so far my very favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Delicious vegan comfort food, I didn't know there was such a thing! I always get their no harm chicken sandwich, which is amazing. I LOVE that all the cups and silverware is biodegradable. Their Nami desserts are also delicious.  I very much prefer their San Fran location as there is far more parking and more room inside but either location deserves a happy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"True carnivore leaving a review here. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and delicious, delicious, meat-free food. I had thee argentine po boy and I wasn't disappointed. The umami taste had me doing a double take and the warm, soft roll that completed my sandwich only blew my mind some more. I'll definitely be back for more of this meat-free deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered Green New Vegetarian restaurant when my diet needs changed. I was looking for something tasty yet vegan. I know, sounds like an oxymoron. I really did find some great things at Green. The business is in a nondescript retail Plaza on the west side of Scottsdale Road, to the south of the Salvation Army store. There is a small outdoor patio, which is nice. The inside is very clean and open, and lends to the trendy side. I especially appreciate the ice machine comma which is correctly labeled with a million small pictures of Ice Cube. There are some great selections on this menu. Let me interject by saying they also have a good selection of beer, wine and other drinks. On my first visit, I tried the classic veggie burger. It was really great. The burger was tasty and had a nice size. The thyme fries, while a little bit on the soggy side, were very tasty as well. On my second visit, I tried the buffalo chicken po-boy. I wasn't as big a fan of this sandwich. It was a very large portion comma and the buffalo sauce had a nice flavor. I think I was just not a fan of the mock chicken texture itself. Again, I had the thyme fries, and they were the same as before. On my most recent visit, I had the Thai peanut Rice Bowl. There was not a whole lot of rice, but just enough to accent the amazing amount of vegetables and perfectly marinated tofu. The sauce was a bit runny, but had a nice flavor. On this visit, a friend and I also ventured into the world of tsoynami. These cups of heaven come in many different flavors and are absolutely delicious non-dairy ice cream treats. We tried the s'mores flavor and also the cookie dough flavor. I could eat the cookie dough all by itself. As a matter of fact, they do sell the cookie dough comma which is also hilariously named DOH!. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting Green. Although, I did go in uniform a few times, and I don't think the guy there is too fond of me. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Green is a vegetarian staple for residents of the Valley. With a diverse array of options, they cater to every palate. I'm a huge fan of the Big Wac, but I loved the No Harm Chicken Parm when I was a student at NAU and would visit home. The only complaint I have is that they're a pretty small location, but this will hopefully change as they continue to expand."}
{"text":"I had high hopes based on the great reviews, but my experience with the food was just ok.  I got take out.  The curry bowl was pretty decent but I also got the fundido sip and the chips were very stale. Noboday likes stale chips!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegan comfort food! Had a BFF budget with fries which was pretty good but the dogobah jungle in a bowl was amazing! Also had the San Diego and chameleon tacos. Favorite vegan place to eat so far in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"The Argentinean Po Boy, The Big Wac, and Seitan Wings are fantastic comfort food to me.   I cant go to Green without splitting a order of the wings with my husband.  We lick the basket clean, haha.  On the advice of a friend, I recently tried the Kaisor Söze Reuben weekly special,  and hope it is added to the menu. LOVED IT!!  We live in South Phoenix and its so nice having one in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak. and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am. i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think it's just psychologically strange. BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.  my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos.   their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.  green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head."}
{"text":"Ordered the BFF and cole slaw..did not disappoint! I'm just now starting to go to vegan restaurants and I was hesitant at first, I'm not at all anymore! It was delicious and honestly tasted like a real chicken sandwich...service was great and during my lunch I saw John Jay from the radio show :) overall fantastic food and experience"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Green. The food is consistently excellent. Families, hipsters and everyone in-between seem to agree this is the place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend and brother. To start off the parking was extremely limited. Next to impossible to find a spot between the two combined  parking spots. Go inside it was sangria day so of course I got that, I was good but not spectacular, couple dollars over priced. The food was good. My brother hated his salad but he ate all the other 5 appetizers we got to try and was well satisfied afterwards. No server came to our table, not sure if they were supposed to hit we went up to order and the woman said oh I'll tell her to come to you, so we went and sat back down and about 5 minutes she took our order, food came out in a timely manner, but after that the server was MIA."}
{"text":"I had a date here last weekend. We ordered the green hummus, which was pretty good. I had the green burger which I thought was just ok, I've had much better veggie burgers before. My date (a vegetarian) had the pizza, which she didn't like at all, I think the mock cheese had something to do with it.   The location is in a strip mall, which wasn't that great, and the ambiance in the restaurant seemed very eclectic (not in a good way).    All and all I'd say I much prefer other semi-vegetarian restaurants, such as Pita Jungle, over this place."}
{"text":"Carnivores and junk-foodies, don't be put off when your crunchy granola friends want to drag you to Green. This fare may be vegan, but it doesn't look it, taste it, or is healthy for you at all. Don't get me wrong: it is completely, totally, and utterly delicious. Their fries were far superior to many traditional burger joints'. But... they're still FRENCH FRIES, people. The jerk tofu salad was impressively spicy, but laden in too-many FRIED won ton strips and chunks of FRIED tofu. Do you see the theme? No wonder my SO nodded enthusiastically throughout the whole meal and offered to come back any time.   I had the G po-boy, buffalo \"chicken\" on a big spongy roll, dripping and oozing in spicy sauce and vegan mayo. The fake meat they use is really, really, really authentic. Like, so authentic, I'm not going to get it next time because I really don't like meat in the first place, hence my vegetarianism. Stringy fibers in my fake chicken grosses me out as much as the stringy fibers in real chicken. The sandwich was tasty -- the bread surprisingly excellent -- but greasy.   So yeah. Two hesitant thumbs up. I'll definitely go again, although I'll have to dig a little deeper on the menu to find something not quite so artery hardening."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food. This is more of a vegan comfort/fast food type of joint which is harder to find than healthier vegan food. Done very well!  The wings were FANTASTIC. Po' boy was excellent. Crab puffs were pretty good - definitely unique - I've never had a vegan version.   Reasonable prices. Friendly and quick service.  I liked the atmosphere inside. I got my food to go but I noticed their craft beer selection and was impressed. Cocktails and wine available too.  Parking lot is a bit small so might get packed during lunch time."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!!!   Animal fries are just fantastic and the burritos are just the best"}
{"text":"A friend of mine flew in from Denver and I found this little gem, since she's vegan. I've eaten here on 3 separate occasions and wanted to try a few things before I left a review. Non dairy milkshakes were my favorite, I missed out on the chocolate cake the 1st time as its a bit pricey here. I did however try their red velvet cupcakes, the cheesesteak, chili cheese fries and woc burger were all very awesome. You wouldn't even notice they were all vegan, I even got my bf to try the Woc and he was surprised cause he's not about that vegan life. Hot wings were also legit and the sauce they make is so good! I couldn't attach a photo because I was so excited and finished my food before I could take a picture"}
{"text":"Found this spot after a search for a quick and healthy dinner after a long drive in from California and was highly impressed with the quality of the vegan/vegetarian food. Spinach, artichoke \"queso\" dip is to die for and the veggie patties on the burgers are truly top notch. Highly recommending this place to my friends here in Phoenix. I'll be back next time I'm in town for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place it's so good. The atmosphere is awesome and the food is out of this world. Please come to LA!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  A separate gluten free vegan menu for those of us wanting to skip the wheat gluten.  I can't eat the tsoynamis, so the desserts here aren't as fun as the the Green in Phx that's next to Nami.  Even so, the food is to die for...especially the buffalo wings and chili fries.  OMG!  Besides the \"junk\" food tho', I love their sweet and sour chicken...yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  Is it me, or has this place gotten even better lately??  They even have a separate gluten free vegan menu, which is helpful.  LOOOVE the chili fries and the buffalo wings.  Favorites include anything with their chicken in it...the sweet and sour chicken is to die for.  LOVE that this place is next to Nami.  It's perfect...get our yums on here and then head to Nami for dessert.  The brunch is very good here as well.  Have I mentioned the buffalo wings?  oh myyyyy."}
{"text":"vegan junk food at its finest-went there a few months ago and REALLY need to go back again!"}
{"text":"OK SO HERES THE DEAL.   I used to love this place. I took family here, mom , grandmas, brother, cousins, the whole shabang . I brought dates here, I brought friends here, I had meetings here, my friends were the ones that brought me here in the first place and I fell in love.   Well honey, that was a year ago, or maybe a few months ago, BUT NOW that has all changed because they CHANGED THEIR MENU.  and its awful.  Long story short, Im a phx native, but I go to school out of state and I had always craved green when I was gone because I wanted GOOD vegan food, that the boca burger and salad crap. So after 14 weeks away I decide to order one of my two favorites and really the only two things i order other than a soynami or wings; the orcettee bowl with no harm chicken parm or the sweet and sour. SO I call to order to go and find out that both of these are NOT on the menu anymore and that they changed their menu literally days after I went back to school. SO , I CANCELED THE ENTIRE ORDER AND WENT SOME WHERE ELSE THAT DOESNT CHANGE THEIR MENU AND TAKE THE BEST THINGS OFF. aka pita jungle.  Literally I am so devastated that i decided to look up other responses to find that I wasn't the only one complaining and that they had changed other things on the menu as well as taken favorites off. They changed their delicious burgers to disgusting boca burgers, and added a bunch of salads.   SERIOUSLY. YOU ADDED BOCA BURGERS AND SALADS? AND TOOK OFF SOME OF THE BEST VEGAN FOOD IN THE WORLD? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I wont eat a boca burger if it was the last thing on earth. Im so sick of going to bbqs and being asked if i want a boca burger. NEXT thing is adding salads? REALLY? did you ever think that salads are really the only thing that vegans can eat at normal restaurants? and you decide to take the good food that vegans cant get anywhere else and replace it with the only thing we can eat.  WOW. THANKS FOR GOING FOR THE STEROTYPE  . VEGETARIAN = ONLY EATS SALADS? REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GOIGN TO TAKE AWAY NEXT? THE WINGS? THE SOYNAMI? im getting out of there waaaaay before that happens. like maybe now. THANKS GREEN.  you hurt my feelings. :(   I honestly dont think i want to go back im so up set. In fact DONT GO. whats on the menu now is nothing compared to what it used to be.   THE POINT IS:  IF YOU HAD SOMETHING AMAZING WHY CHANGE IT?  if your going to add things to the menu dont take things away. the sweet and sour and the ocette pasta was literally the only thing i ever got there besides wings and a soynami and now what? you may call me stubborn but both of those were so good that all you ever wanted were those two items. If you have the ingredients why not put them back together to make something amazing?  so thanks green for making my homecoming suck because you changed your menu and made it horrible. MAYBE you should just Add on to the old menu and not completely wipe it off the face of the earth."}
{"text":"Wow. Cannot get enough of this place. It's got a really nice ambience about it and the service is really good. My husband and I are recently vegan so we sometimes crave burgers and such. I did not know vegan food could be so good. We would come here even if we weren't vegan. The Big Wac Burger is incredible. Kills those burger cravings every time. Def recommend."}
{"text":"If only the customer service were as good as the food. The man working the cashier stand informed us that we couldn't bring outside drinks in (I was unaware and brought a tea in with me), I proceeded to ask if we could sit outside then and he responded saying \"I guess\", rolling his eyes, and seemed visibly annoyed with us. It's unfortunate that Green is one of the few vegetarian restaurants in the area or else I would have taken my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm probably the longest customer; I came here when it was veggie fun and just bought from the old owner. Green has come a long way but after a visit back to Arizona, this will be my last trip.   I am accustomed to prices at casual restaurants in California with higher rent and higher wages. The current menu price increases put them higher than California restaurants and definitely full service prices with out full service.   Will not be returning as the prices cannot justify the service and quantity."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I took my boyfriend here and was hesitant about it because he's such a fan of meat. He ended up loving it and won't stop asking me to take him back! The Kung pao with brown rice is my favorite"}
{"text":"I have been to Green over 10 times so I feel confident giving a review. I have yet to try something there I didn't like. We always order the wings to share and then get our own meal. I am gluten free and they make it easy to find delicious and filling items."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of eating meat. I am by no means vegetarian and don't try to be. My fiance had to practically drag me in this place and it is AMAZING!!! I have eating here numerous times and every item is fantastic. I can't even tell their chicken isn't actually chicken. Their secret barbecue chicken is fantastic. I keep finding myself coming back here again and again to try something new. I recommend Green to anyone who likes good food which I think is everyone."}
{"text":"It was so good! They take comfort foods and make them vegan and so delicious. Wish we had something similar in Prescott."}
{"text":"I haven't been to green in a while, since I moved further south, but today I was trying to think of a good lunch to treat myself to and remembered about Green and I'm so glad I did.  Note: I am not vegetarian or vegan or anything else.  The food here is just fantastic. I actually really love fake chicken and beef and contrary to what most omnivores think - this vegetarian food is neither bland nor tasteless. Actually it's the opposite, the curry and thai dishes are to die for.   If you've never been here you're missing out. If you're not a vegetarian, I hope you'll give it a chance anyways, you may find that you like it better than some meat based dishes at other restaurants. Oh, and don't forget to try a Tsoynami while you're there, it's a soy milkshake with real fruit. Mango is my favorite."}
{"text":"My neighborhood. I'm so spoiled. It's also next to Nami. Everything I've had there is good. And vegan.  The fries are incredible. The burger also delicious and perfectly sauced. Great beer, too. Only problem is, it's always super busy. And that means--because it's so small--it feels cramped. Honestly though, that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant.  Literally everything is good here. I love the mock chicken artichoke salad and the blonde alfredo. The staff is friendly and there is always cool art on the walls. I wish there were more vegan places like this is the valley!"}
{"text":"A Green-loving friend of mine finally got my to try this place out with her - I'm slowly becoming a fan!!  I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian, but I welcome new tastes with loving arms (er..mouth)...Anyways, I've been here a couple times now, and the \"mock\" food was pretty good!  The 1st visit, I tried the Lemon Pesto bowl with mock chicken, it was pretty good overall, but I wasn't really a fan of the weird, chewy mock chicken.  Luckily, there were only 3! pieces in it, so I was okay with that I guess.   The second time around, I tried the Coconut Curry bowl with the house tofu.  It was delicious!!  The house tofu is lightly fried and seasoned, so good I think most people would like it,  even if they weren't into \"health\" food.   Since I'm an ice cream lover, I had to try the Tsoynami, \"homemade vegan soy tSoft tServe, \" which then they stir in all sorts of goodies like cakes, cookies, chocolate, peanut butter and just about anything you can think of. I loved this copycat of a Blizzard!  I got the Dough Boy, which had vegan cookie dough in it and organic chocolate syrup.   I would definitely return here anytime my Green-loving friend wants to get her fix!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to eat every time I visit the Phoenix area!!  Brought my meat eating brother once and he did not know it was all vegan. Loves it!!"}
{"text":"Love it here. I feel like it's a little piece of heaven! They have tons of great vegan/vegetarian options...so much so that you carnivorisaurs will still love it.  The calexico burger...omg. DO it!! Right now! The hummus is so flavorful and amazing. The \"burger\" itself is a little spicy, but perfectly seasoned. And for you usual meat lovers, I recommend the argentine po-boy. You won;t even notice there isn't meat in it. Trust me.  And save room for a soy-nami. Lots of room, these things are massive. Or share one, because after about 6-7 bites into it you might feel ready to explode. Yes, I know from personal experience."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about Green, and it's taken me years to finally get down there to try it out.  It's the kind of vegetarian restaurant that even a carnivore would enjoy. The menu is large and creative, and \"meat-substitutes\" like fake chicken and fake beef are available (I'll stick to tofu, thank you.)  I went with a friend and we both ordered bowls off their menu. I got the one with the mushrooms sauteed in sake (so good) with brown rice, veggies, and house made tofu. With a tip it was about $10, and I had leftovers.  Definitely will be going back there again."}
{"text":"Green was wonderful! I ate here last Thursday. I know, this review is a little late :) The atmosphere at Green is very laid-back and comfortable. We had the buffalo 'wingz', classic burger and the chao sandwich. Everything was delicious. I am by no means veggie but you could have fooled me. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who's veggie, carnivorous or who just wants to eat good food that's good for you! Eat at Green! You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I like this place a whole lot. The atmosphere is pretty neat (unhinged car doors along the wall, couches set up for comfortable nomming, and pretty writing on the walls. I don't know much about the vegetarian/vegan lifestyle, but I do know that every vegan item I have ever put in my mouth has been immediately spit out. I told the girl taking our orders that I am not a vegan, thinking I may be shunned from the establishment, but instead she told me she wasn't either and then she assured me that their faux meat actually tastes like sweet, juicy, animal meat (my words, not hers). Praise Jesus! And she was so right! I had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and it actually tasted like chicken! However, it didn't feel any healthier to eat. Loaded with BBQ sauce and mayo, I still felt like a fatty. My husband, also the polar opposite of anything vegetarian, ordered the Diablo Red and fell in love. This place is nearing a 4 star review, but the menu looks so scary to me that I don't know if I can give it a 4 yet. Lots of spicy items and I don't like spice. Really good food, service, and atmosphere. As the Terminator once stated, \"I'll be bock.\""}
{"text":"Oh my f****** goodness! I am so in love with this place and can't wait to come back for more. Vegan paradise for real. I'm sitting here waiting for my Tsunami Chai and I just smashed a PoBoy with Animal Fries"}
{"text":"Big Wac all the way!! Every time we visit Tempe we grab a big wac, fries, and tsoynami!! It NEVER disappoints!!! The buffalo wings are also one of our favorites!! Yum yum yum!!! Now I'm craving it!!!"}
{"text":"During the tail-end of our trip to AZ this past weekend, my vegetarian husband and I found Green and loved it so much we ate there 3 times in 2 days. It would have been 4 had it not been closed one morning.   As a meat-eater with a soy allergy, there are many reasons not to eat here, but I gave all of that up to enjoy as many entrees as possible.   Where do I begin...we tried the buffalo wings which had the right taste and texture as meat ones, and the ranch dressing was perfect, the CRAB PUFFS which were mind-blowing, the bbq sandwich, the curry pasta, the argentine sandwich (delicious bread and chimichurri sauce), the fish tacos (which were good but not nearly as amazing as the other entrees), and the kung pao chicken. And oh yes, two cupcakes and the betterfinger soy ice cream.   I am so depressed there isn't one in Austin, but I would say Green is reason enough to go back to AZ."}
{"text":"One star for the rude guy who told my guest that she can't have outside drinks....okay get it ...didn't have to say it in a rude way."}
{"text":"First time here. We thought it may be in a \"hip\" place downtown so we skipped the closer location to us in Tempe. It's not in a good spot but it is cute, clean and friendly. Parking was minimal so we had to park down the block and walk. The portions were large. We certainly could have shared. My husband isn't vegan but he really liked the food as well."}
{"text":"I love green.  I had the \"chicken\" made from tofu and it was really good.  I think I actually liked it better than regular chicken.  Green is awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Arizona. My family eats here regularly for their glutton free options. Would recommend to anyone the staff is nice and the good is great. Worth a try."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Arizona. Great gluten free option nice staff and great location. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I am always a bit cautious about new vegan restaurant's,  but Green New American Vegetarian got it right and the crowd in a other wise empty strip mall is an indication on how good it is.  I ordered the take on a famous national chain burger,  their BIG WAC lives unto its reputation as being not great but awesome,  turning meat eaters to non meat eaters,  very well done.   That an an order of Thyme fries and my lunch cravings were met and exceeded.    I can't wait to go back and start exploring their menu.  Keep up the good work, Green New American."}
{"text":"Every vegan in the world should come here for the Big Wac.  No, not just every vegan, everyone.  I'm sure the rest of the menu is great, my husband has gotten the buffalo chicken sandwich before, I just can't NOT get the Big Wac.  Make sure to go next door for dessert at Nami too"}
{"text":"Love this place, everything I've tried has been great, my favorite is the Big Wac with fries!  Vegan junk food at its best, but you don't have to go that route if you don't want to, you can go with healthy vegan, but why would you when you can get the big WAC?!?  They also have several craft beers, and a good selection of bottled soda.  Make sure to get dessert next door at Nami!"}
{"text":"Beer plus vegan food?!?! Look no further. Holy moly is this place legit. If you're in town and need a grapefruit Sculpin on tap and some vegan buffalo wings, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I'm not into fake meats so I can't speak to what appears to be a significant part of Green's menu. However, I've been wanting to try this place for a while since I'm in Phoenix every now and then for work. Glad I finally could.  My order of Red Diablo was good but inaccurately named. An entree with \"diablo\" in the title and described as being spicy with roasted eggplant and tomato should have kick...not to mention eggplant and tomato. Instead, I got lots of carrots, broccoli, and zucchini in a decidedly un-spicy sauce, and 4 small pieces of eggplant. No tomato that I could discern.  Was it good? Yes. Was it what I thought I was getting? No. Would I go back and give Green another try the next time I'm in town? Definitely.   (I also tried their green hummus - creamy and refreshing with raw garlic zing.  Sesame oil drizzle was a surprising and welcome twist.  Curry dusted pita chips were a nice accompaniment. Yummy!)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great tasting food, and awesome concept. I'm not vegan and it still taste normal to me. Great place to ease someone who wants to become vegan. Try the drunken mushroom or big wac. U won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a rather picky eater and my first attempt at a fully Vegan restaurant   was interesting. I like my meat so when I first saw 'mock' chicken and 'mock' beef I had to double take at the menu. I decided to play it safe with ordering the balsamic strawberry and green salad. I was a tad dissappointed the dressing was  a tad bland and the fig's in the salad through the flavor off for me, but it wasn't bad.  would I order that dish again, probably not. Would I go back? I think I would just to give it a try and see if they have something of more flavor but wouldn't be the first on my list of options."}
{"text":"Why would it be okay to serve a burnt sandwich?? The bun and the patty were scorched and so was my friends sandwich. Today was an extremely off day for you guys. Even the tables being cleared and cleaned was not done and it wasn't that busy. Did you hire new staff?? Short staffed?? I should of refused my sandwich and asked for it to be remade but I needed to beat the rush hour traffic on the 10. ?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Best vegetarian restaurant in the valley by far. Last year I stopped eating meat and I must say, it's pretty challenging to find these meat spin offs that actually taste good! I'm kind of weary about even trying them tbh but everything I've tried here has been beyond delicious. Plus, the staff here is absolutely wonderful:)   I'm definitely recommending the hot wings, they are my favorite! I even share them with my meat-eater friends and everyone loves them"}
{"text":"Traveling through Phoenix as road warriors on a hot summer day we  found a place even Mad Max  would approve of. We had the Singapore Orange bowl, and Wendy's pickle for lunch and started it off with the buffalo wings with creamy cucumber ranch dressing. All were fantastic. The Singapore had an orange sauce on mock meat and I picked noodles that were cooked just right as was the veggies. Wendy's pickle was made with REALLY good bread, mock chicken and lots of pickles and came with thyme fries. All vegan but bring the meat eaters.                                                  Imperator Furiosa: You never gonna have a better chance. Max Rockatansky: At what? Imperator Furiosa: Redemption."}
{"text":"Go to Green! I've had problems in the past with servers, but I believe those employees have moved on from Green. Other than that, let me list the reasons why I love Green:  1. I am a vegetarian. It's nice to have a completely vegan restaurant--I don't have to worry about what I can/cannot eat on the menu! Also, the food tastes like vegetarian food. This could be confusing to meat-eaters, so let me explain; a lot of vegetarian options at places that serve meat are cooked like you would cook meat, therefore the taste is different. It's nice not to be overloaded with spices or sauce just because it's all veggie food.  2. The atmosphere is comfortable. Sometimes the music is a little loud, but it's definitely not as bad as a lot of other places around The Valley.  3. Take Out! This is one of my favorite places to grab food after roller derby practice! It's quick, healthy, and filling.  4. I have a lot of friends that eat meat. Not one of them has said anything negative about the food here. Plus, the people here don't look down on meat-eaters. One of my biggest pet-peeves is when vegetarian extremists think lowly of people that eat meat--you're giving a bad name to us other vegetarians! Calm down!   5. It's affordable. Yes! Affordable vegetarian food! Amazing, right?!  6. Have a Tsoynami. No, really. Trust me.  Personally, I think the food tastes better at this location than the 7th Street location. And, as mentioned earlier, there have been a couple of staff members that have been...well...rather rude. But they don't work here anymore, as far as I can tell. There's always a rotten apple, right? Except for the food. Nothing rotten about the food.  Go here! Every day!"}
{"text":"If the review box would like me type delicious ten times, that would be my review :)  Next door is an awesome vegan ice cream shop too!"}
{"text":"Loved this and its sister restaurant in Phoenix. Favs were the Cheesesteak, Thai Peanut Bowl, Crab Puffs, Egglessrolls, and Chili Fries. Great options, tastes, and textures. I would be here constantly if I lived in this area...but I'm glad I travel here a few times a year because this is in my top 3 veg joints ever."}
{"text":"Impressive! Loved the Cheesesteak, Thai Peanut Bowl, Crab Puffs, Egglessrolls, and Chili Fries. Even got some to go to eat in the hotel room. Seriously, everything tasted great, had perfect texture, and even some spicy kicks here and there. Can't say enough good things about the food."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but I do love this place.  I'm not picky about what the food is, I like good food, and they serve good food here.  Any of the rice bowls are great, as well as the burgers I've tried.  Thyme fries are great!"}
{"text":"I am not a big vegetarian but this place is bomb as hell. They have a large menu of items and options that resemble traditional meals but they are all vegas safe.   Everything i have gotten here has been excellent. Full flavor and good combinations. Most things dont taste exactly like their non-vegan counterpart but still excellent non the less!"}
{"text":"Best Vegan restaurant in AZ!  Bottom line if you want great vegan food this is the place to go! The restaurant also features local artists from the community, which I love. I have even brought some of my meat eating friends here (they either love it or hate it).  I am not sure that I would describe the food as \"healthy\", but if you are in the mood for a fat-kid veggie comfort-food fix this is your place.  I am sad they are not open on Sundays!   Huge fan of  -Drunken mushroom chicken -The green salad (that is what it is called),  -Buffalo chicken wings.  -Poboy  Would skip -Crab puff (I am in the minority here...my friends are obsessed with them) -The taco special (bleh)"}
{"text":"YUM!  I have recently become a vegetarian (NO MEAT!) and really enjoy having a strictly vegetarian eatery within a half hour drive.  The food here is amazing & makes me come back for more.  Anyone who likes good food or is trying to cut down their meat consumption, should definitely check out the Green Vegetarian Restaurant."}
{"text":"After listening about this place so much finally I found a good occasion to visit it. It was a great choice for a Lent Friday and my mom. She had the Drunken Mushroom Noodle Bowl and yes WE SCORED! (she doesn't like food in US in general) so this was a great choice, not spicy, not just meat and carbs, and not overpriced.  My friend had the Singapore Tofu Noodle Bowl and was delighted. And I had the  Argentine Po-Boy, YUM!! it almost taste like tender beef! though I was not able to perceive the chimichurri ... To finish we had a vegan double (or was it triple) chocolate slice. Happy ladies after that!!!  Staff is really friendly and service is great despite the demand they have. I would join their carnivore caravan if I were around. For sure a lot of hard core carnivore could consider reducing their intake.   Downside? plastic cups, and other not very earth friendly material in their serving baskets. Maybe  next time !"}
{"text":"You guys have great food and I haven't had a problem up until today.    I thought it was a messed up move that when we ordered our two soynami's with dinner that their size was reduced by half but we were still charged the same amount as before.  We had to call to find out this was not a mistake and were disappointed that this was told to us after the fact."}
{"text":"Well this adventure started off as a simple quest to try out Green's tsoynami. Somehow the quest grew and sent Joyce W. and I on an epic journey of wondrous taste and exotic delights. Calvin put it best when he said, \"Some days even my lucky rocket ship underpants don't help.\" You know that feeling when your stomach says no more but your taste buds are jumping up and down as if they were in a club yelling out, \"More!\"? Well Green does that to you. I'm not a big vegetarian but if my own dishes always tasted this good, I wouldn't mind. I had their special, RocknRolled tacos with a side of addicting fries... nami nami so good in my tummi. Then washed it all down with their delicious drinks. However it doesn't end with the taste or super smells but there are the sights. The place is decorated in an artsy cool urban look which gives Green a unique flare all its own. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of an all-vegan restaurant. Green is all-vegan and so you know you can have a guilt-free meal. The food is mostly mock-meat versions of stuff like chicken parmesan, buffalo wings, etc. If you like greasy, fried food with heavy sauces and want to try the vegan version of it, that's what Green is good for. It tastes good, but I don't feel so great afterward.  If you prefer healthy, clean organic food loaded with fresh veggies and minimally-processed, try Chakra 4 or Persian Garden Cafe."}
{"text":"If I was given the option to eat nothing but meat for the rest of my life (and stay healthy) I would do it. And if it could be nothing but fried meat with gravy smothered all over it... even better. Yet here I am at a vegan restaurant... and I ate every single bite of my diablo red... and I'm excited to come back... has Hell frozen over my friends!? I doubt it. I think Green just has an absolutely phenomenal chef. Kristen's secret barbecue chicken sandwich was great too, you basically would have no idea these were vegetarian dishes. While the atmosphere is a little too hippie/hipster for my general liking, the food was really good and the staff were awesome and very willing to help us first timers. You've gotta try this place, if nothing other than to expand your culinary knowledge, but I'd be surprised if you left disliking anything you tried."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Everything was either fried or so salty I could not even eat it. The atmosphere was nice, laid back and stylish but the food was not good. I got the tofu with veggies and brown rice and it was so salty I could even take more than 2 bites. We also the hummus and pita as an appetizer. The pita chips were FRIED and so greasy! I left with a stomach ache. Very disappointed. I came all the way from the bay area to try this place and will not recommend to vegan friends or anyone else. Sorry guys! Need to go with fresh local produce menu and help make vegans proud... help all people  eat healthy...not stuff them with fried processed food that will contribute to America's obesity problem. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat! Their \"buffalo wings\" are my favorite! I always get two orders with a side of brown rice and mix everything together! The only thing that doesn't impress me is the type of buns they use for their burgers. Other than that, great place and great food!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints at all on this one. My first time here and I tried the Thai Chicken. It was very good, staff is wonderful. I hope to come back to this area again to try out more on the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because most of the reviews are awesome, and I've had multiple meat eating friends recommend Green to me. Sadly, my first experience was far from what I expected. The woman who took our order was rude, impatient, and unhelpful. Our food was served quickly, but most of it seemed like it had been sitting around and was zapped through the microwave before it got to us. I ordered the BFF and chili cheese fries. The sandwich was only slightly warm and had cold spots throughout. The chili fries were cold and soggy. It was apparent that they only heated them enough to melt the cheese on top. Everything I ordered was lacking in flavor. Basically, the service was crap and so was the food. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came here last night to experience all that is Green.  I was excited because I'm trying to go on this less meat eating path, and Green is the perfect place to do so.  The setup is absolutely adorable with the denim insulation and the VW hubcaps and car doors.  And the menu layout for all the tsoynamis is equally cute.  My friend and I got the wings to start, the red diablo, and the kung pao bowl.  The wings were really good, and I love the dipping sauce they came with!  I was in heaven with my red diablo bowl.  I loved the consistency of the mock chicken and the eggplant had been soaked in sauce for a while so it was completely mushy, just the way I like it!  I completely polished off my bowl, and my friend did the same.  Yet he was still craving the tsoynami since the guy at the counter gave us a free sample.  After going through all of our options, at which point he decided we would never be friends again because I don't like coffee, rootbeer, or mint, we decided on the rocky road tsoynami.  These things are huge and perfect to split with someone for an after dinner treat.  They definitely do not skimp on the toppings.  This place is perfect to get some flavorful vegetarian in, and it's served at a pretty good price.  I definitely have to come back and check out the salads."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch. I'm dealing with food allergies (soy and gluten being one of them) so I'm a little limited. I can eat a couple of the salads and the coconut curry due to the overwhelming soy on the menu. I believe they have a decent number of gluten-free options if soy is not an issue. The few menu items I can eat are really good especially the green salad and the balsamic picnic salad. HOWEVER, I confirmed with the cook and staff the canola oil is NOT organic which means it is Genetically Engineered (GE) canola oil. You must ask what the oil is if you are ordering something that is cooked, sauteed, etc. To avoid the GMOs ask for EVOO or organic canola. I was told the soy is organic and should be free of GMOs. My meat loving brother and fiance LOVE the Big Wac and say it tastes better than a Big Mac."}
{"text":"Fresh quality vegetarian cuisine I have tried two dishes thus far and based upon these two I can hardly bring myself to eat anywhere else The juice fountain has various juices and teas for $1.75 Refills are free A very small venue welcoming and friendly Lots of smiles all around"}
{"text":"Hell yea! I love every item on the menu. I am so cereal!!! And you don't have to be a mega hipster to eat there (don't worry, there are still plenty if them there)"}
{"text":"Best veggie restaurant in Arizona (not that the competition is stiff here in this cattle loving state, but Green could hold it's own even in more liberal territory).  Faves: buffalo wings, chili fries, samosas, any of their po'boys, any of their vegan \"shakes\" Great place to take a meat eater to introduce them to fake meat options."}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure Vegan eats. The Big Wac is awesome as are the \"buffalo\" wings. Place can get kinda crazy busy. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good! Some of the workers looked overworked and unhappy, but other than that, the experience was an overall positive.  Try Nami next door too, they have some awesome vegan soy-based ice cream. Delish!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was super good!!! We had the buffalo wings, samosas, and egglessrolls. You would never guess there is not meat in there nor do you even miss it. They also sell agave soda which is a huge plus for me as I am always on the lookout for healthy sweetener alternatives. Also dig the use of the car doors as decoration. Creative!"}
{"text":"Very popular place. I ordered coconut curry with mock chicken for take out. It was delicious. The ice cream was spectacular. I love the taste of vanilla soy milk. I will definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Everyone that works here is super friendly and always happy to help. The food comes out fast and is so amazingly delicious!!! My bf who is not vegetarian loves this place too. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place in AZ! Well I should probably back that up, it's the only place I have eaten in AZ. But it's great food was amazing and quick. Line was long but it's cause they have great food! And they have beer...."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by this place. The first time I tried it was on a trip visiting some friends when I didn't live here. I finally got my meat eater boyfriend to take me and I loved it!  The staff was really friendly and helped me pick out the green burger (that is really red) with vegan cheese. I LOVED it. I have really never had a vegan burger that tasted that good. And the fries are to die for, the best I have ever had also. Which is saying a lot..because I like french fries.   They lean more towards the \"comfort food\" than healthful choices, but even vegans need their comfort food sometimes.   The decor was unique and really pleasant. One of the walls was decorated with car doors and it looked like all the tables and plates and such were from ikea.   I know that they sometimes have live music there but I have never gotten a change to catch it.   I would recommend everyone try this little place. Even if you eat meat you will love it, at least that is what all my carnivore friends say."}
{"text":"Took my very non vegan relatives here for their first vegan meal. They were impressed, and said they would come back! Good food and relaxed atmosphere. I tried the Wendy's pickle and loved it! I can't wait to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"So my doctor has put me on a mandatory 1 month vegan diet. Lucky for me Green is a vegan restaurant!   I have always wanted to try Green, but had never really had an excuse to go.   So Friday night the hubs and I make the trek across town. We arrived about 630 and it was JAM PACKED. Not a seat to be had. At Green you stand in line and place your order at the register and pay for it then. You find a seat and a waiter will come out and yell your name and then deliver your food.   We placed our order and took a table outside as that was all there was. Kinda sucked, but oh well. It did start to rain, but there was a little over hang keeping us dry.  We ordered starters. Crab Puffs and Spicy Buffalo \"wings\" Both were pretty good. The crab puffs were spot on, you really couldn't tell a difference between them and the real thing. The \"wings\" were good as well, but for sure a big difference between the real thing and the mock. But still tasty.   The hubs ordered the Original \"g\" Spicy Po-Boy, a Spicy buffalo mock chicken sammie and I got the Mum's Meatball Po-Boy. Both were really very good. The Thyme fries are really crisp and tasty, but like other reviews, you cant really taste the thyme, not sure whats up with that.   After we were done, we decided to get a couple Tsoynamis to go. I am a ice cream FREAK, so that WAS going to be my biggest challenge getting through the 1 month Vegan diet...but not anymore. OMG...The tsoynami's are AMAZING!!! I had the Deez Hazelnuts, freaken fantastic! The hubs got the Betterfinger (Greens version of a butterfinger) SO GOOD!!!!   We will be going back to green even after I am done with my 1 month stint as a vegan."}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food that is the best. Staff is awesome and knowledgable. I highly recommend the wings. The Namis. And really everything else. Some items (sauces) can be a bit salty so beware. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix hands down! Everything is amazing and I can bring my non-vegan friends and they leave satisfied! Get the red diablo, it's perfection! Also the peanut butter chocolate bars by the register are AMAZING after a few minutes in the freezer!!! Yum yum gimme me some!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this place is AMAZING. As a person that loves cheese (sorry! I'm working on it)... the Mac and Cheese doesn't really meet the standards...  BUT! I can go out and enjoy incredibly tasty hot wings, and thats just the best thing ever. Their drinks are great, their crab puffs are super tasty, and the eggless rolls are great. I wish I could eat here daily for lunch."}
{"text":"I love being able to get vegetarian hot wings. Now I have no reason to go back to meat.   As for the rest of the food, the chili is good, the mac n cheese is a little weird... but the crab puffs are tasty!  It's a litle hit or miss on some of the food items with regards to their 100% meat duplication, but nothing is bad on it's own without meat comparison.   I'd love to go back again!"}
{"text":"Facts  Food: delicious  Variety: amazing Quantity: good Drinks: refills on green tea, strawberry lemonade, regular lemonade, this burgundy drink that tastes delicious, and bottled selection (no refills). Restaurant: clean, cute, cozy, very small Staff: friend Wait for food: fast, quick  Parking: a nightmare, the worst.   I ordered the chili cheese fries, special jalapeno and avocado big wac, samosa (4), curry chic bowl and that yummiest burgundy drink. I think it was called nectar.   I would like to see other mock meat options besides soy.. I'm a vegan and a cancer survivor who do not eat soy due to the cancer soy estrogen risk.   Yummy additions: Portobello mushroom burger. Non soy veggie patty  This is a safe serve restaurant.  Stand in line. Give them your order. Pay. And u will receive a  number standy to place on your table. They will bring your good.  They will also remove the dishes from your table when done.  My rating Food Taste, quality & quanity: 5 stars Parking: 1 star Food selection: 4 stars (would like to see more non soy selections)  I would return."}
{"text":"I had the vegan chili fries with thousand island on the side. I also had one ultimo taco and maybe red sangria. My husband had the big wac burger and a bottled cream soda. We spent $35  So... EYE (yes I but with emphasis) enjoyed the ultimo taco. My husband didn't so much. It's a pretty basic American made taco with chunks of tomatoes and lettuce (not my style of taco) but still tasty. The mock meat was pretty good. The chili fries were OKAY until I added the side of thousand island dressing that doesn't come with it. My sangria was refreshing and HUGE for $10.   My hubby was disappointed in the wac burger. It REALLY tastes like a big Mac burger... and we didn't pay $35 for McDonald's tasting foods so He wasnt happy. He said here wasn't a lot of flavor their fries were basic as hell... they call them thyme fries and charge $4 for a handful.. basically McDonald's fried but less crispy .   He wanted to give a two star review but I DID enjoy my food and obviously plenty of other do since the line was out of the door."}
{"text":"I like to think of Green as the fast food for the GI challenged.  Whether you're allergic to something, can't tolerate the taste of a particular item, curious of the spectrum of the V's world, drop by this hidden niche.  It's right beside Acme printing and has some pretty decent grub.  I love food but this is a different type of love as in I was hungry an hour later type love.  The food is pretty good with mock grass grazer type substitute which was part of the appeal and sparked my question of \"if you can't eat something because you have a particular thought for the furry and cute why try the mock with the same name?\"  Anywho personal thought integrated.  The service is very courteous and overall the restuarant is very community involved which is super nice as well.  More than just a place to grab food but also grab some local news!"}
{"text":"The first few times I tried this place, I would've given it 4 stars. However, the saltiness aspect makes me detract a star. I love their faux chicken (seitan? Soy?) and I usually get the original g spicy po-boy sandwich with the thyme fries (that don't taste like thyme but are still yummy). Big WAC and the BBQ sandwich are both winners. I stay away from the bowls, the food always seems to get cold quickly. I like their samosas and chicken wings as well. Please cut back on the salt, people! As much as I love savory foods, it's really too much. Otherwise, service is always top notch and the place is always busy. Parking can be an issue at times."}
{"text":"YUM-DIDDLY. This place hits the spot. It's kind of hidden in a little strip mall off of Scottsdale so make sure you are keeping your eyes peeled when you're looking for it. Everything I've ever had here has been good. I loved it when I was a vegetarian and I love it now that I'm not. It was definitely hard to convince some meat eaters to come to a vegan place but once I got them there they all loved it. I don't know how this chef does it but all of the mock meat tastes so real its crazy. I think the Calexico burger is my favorite thing that I've tried thus far but the menu is pretty big so I still have a lot of ground to cover. The bowls and the po boys are the bomb too and so are the crab puffs. I've only tried one of the soynamis (I think it was a PB&J one) but it was soooo good. I always go with the intention of getting one but then I'm too full after eating my main meal that I just can't do it, rough life. I'll have to go back one of these 115 degree days and go solely for that reason. Also, I've seen some vegan jerky in there that I've wanted to try before. And they usually have a really good special of the day. One thing to note is don't expect that it's going to be some super crazy healthy vegan place. I would classify this more as vegan comfort food. NOM."}
{"text":"House tofu is so good. I always order the rice bowl with house tofu. Veggies are fresh and crunchy. Buffalo wings are also super good with spicy and nice texture. Crab puffs are another menu we always order because of their crispy and creamy.   After meal, I enjoy nami soft serve and some vegan baked goods."}
{"text":"Delicious buffalo wings and house tofu with veggie and rice (does not matter what kind of sauce/style you get)."}
{"text":"First: The food tastes all right, albeit very salty. However, after eating here for some time I had to stop. Unsure if it's the salt content or the amount of processed ingredients, but I feel terrible after eating here.  Which is sad, because I have a soft spot for the po'boy.  Sum up: if you don't mind indulging in junk food that's still vegan, this is a good place. It's convenient, it's fast, and it's pretty relaxed.  But if you're looking for something nutritious and clean, there are other places."}
{"text":"My boyfriend showed me this place and I was super impressed.  They have a great menu full of healthy vegan options.  They also sell wine and beer, which is always a huge plus in my book.  Wine is life.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan/vegetarian fare for non-vegans. I've had the Big Wac and the Po Boy. Both were great and really filling. Would never have known they were vegan. My favorite though are the Tsoynamis. They are SO good. If you go, get one."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and the food was delicious! I had the Po' boy sandwich and a banana creme shake. So good! I had no ideas you could make a vegan shake as heavenly as they do."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT Vegetarian place! Especially if you want to taste something that is faux-meat.  PROS:   - Lots of tasty options, even \"meaty\" alternatives   - Vegan   - Fast   - Prices are good  CONS:   - A bit loud with the music playing and not much sound damping   - Not really healthy, you must order the right stuff for that"}
{"text":"Best place ever. Big Wac?!  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not a vegetarian or vegan. That said, I am not well versed in what types of food vegan restaurants typically offer but I love Green! I can't even tell their mock chicken isn't chicken. I have tried several dishes, and all were excellent. My favorite is the Jerk salad- the dressing is delicious. The service here is great and you can get in and out pretty quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place ! I had the Big Wac and was shocked of how much it actually tasted like a burger ! Also , their their organic teas , black currant and lime juices are very good in the big self serve containers ( dont expect to get soda here) .. I wish I could eat here everyday ! The menu seems so creative , will definitely be back to try more items !"}
{"text":"We were here in January. On our hunt for food,  we found this place.   We had the \"bff,\" the \"Chicago cheesesteak,\" and the chilli cheese fries.  The chilli cheese fries were okay. The fries were too thin, so they got soggy pretty fast. The flavor was okay as well. I would order them again, just wouldn't pour the chilli cheese on the fries and instead I would dip them.  The Chicago cheesesteak wasn't that great. The meat substitute had no flavor although the onion and bell pepper were cooked perfectly.  Now the bff was amazing. It is the reason for the 4 stars. The \"chicken\" was soft and had a overall wonderful flavor.  We were only in Tempe a few days, but if we go back, we will make sure to stop by again even if it is just to get the bff."}
{"text":"\"Buffalo\" wings and the Big Wac are so so delicious! It is one of my favorites restaurants to go for delicious vegan food. I see lots of meat eaters that are surprised to find how delicious vegan food can be."}
{"text":"Ah, what more can be said about this little slice of Heaven in North Tempe? Well, let me offer something from a new perspective: I am a conservative Republican Catholic and I love Green!  I often like to come here after work. It is right in the middle of my 2.2 mile commute, and so I can easily walk here, eat, and walk to the next bus stop. So if you see me in my work uniform - I work at a Catholic parish - you will know that I think it is worth the walk.  I especially enjoy coming here on Fridays, when I abstain from meat. Now I could be somewhere eating seafood or dairy or eggs, but I choose Green because the food is just that good. My motto? \"Hippies have the best food!\" Restaurants usually try to be apolitical. The key to a good restaurant is mostly in not offending anyone's ideologies. Green's decor and ambiance is clearly quirky and off-beat and appeals mostly to young hipsters, but you can tell that the only politics important here are kindness to animals and care for the environment. I can get behind these things!  I have been here many times now. It is becoming even more of a regular thing as I get used to the three-block walk in between buses. I have tried various dishes and they're all fantastic. Some of the best are the Lemon Pesto Bowl and the Chili Fries with \"Cheese\". I have also had Edamame, Samosas, and No Harm Chicken Parm, all great. Once I had a mock burger that was weird and would've been sub-standard even for Jack in the Box. But I'm happy to ignore the outliers when the rest is delish. Lately I have quite enjoyed my share of Vanilla Almond Milk Shakes. I am sure these have more than a few calories but it's definitely a refreshing treat on a hot day. And the portion isn't huge, so I don't feel that guilty about indulging.  The price is right! Everything is so reasonable, and the servers are super-friendly and nice. An especially nice feature is a big fridge full of interesting drinks, none of which I've ever tried, not to mention the fresh-mixed juices and ades on the counter. Also there is an impulse-buy set of shelves for things to take home, all of which are full of vegetarian goodness.  If you're in doubt about what to get, try my favorite. The Lemon Pesto Bowl with House Tofu and Brown Rice. You really can't go wrong. The walnuts in here are a special treat. Plenty of mixed veggies in a delectable tart lemon sauce. I like to break out the chopsticks for this one. Also, don't miss the Tsoynamis, a soft-serve treat that is also refreshing on a hot day. I tried one once and it was wonderful. But being on a diet, I shy away from sugary creamy frozen treats as a matter of course. It's not for me but perhaps it is for you!  I am known for my ability to eat just about anywhere a bus stops. I adamantly refuse to go out of my way to eat - that's why when I'm at home on my day off, I am likely to order delivery food or, in a pinch, I might walk one block to a restaurant. Green is so conveniently placed on my commute, and so delicious, that it has rightly taken its place among my regular hangouts. And I am proud to recommend them to other conservatives. Don't let your politics keep you away from really great food!"}
{"text":"Let me put it to you this way fellow yelpers, took the family to Greens for lunch about a month ago which included my son in law Mr Meat and Potatoes and he LOVED it!!!  He got the Philly Cheese..  The fried brussel sprouts are AMAZING!!!  I got the Big Wac finally and everyone had some and LOVED it too!!!!  This is the best place!!!!  Need more of them around the valley!!!  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"\"Wait, we're in Arizona?\" \" No seriously, this is Arizona?\" I had to keep blinking cause I could've sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table.   My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly, neither of us were too stoked on the visit. We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix?? Anyways... she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green.   I LOVED EVERYTHING. From our appetizers (hummus + fries) to my entree- I had the chicken curry noodle bowl, to my beverage- a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade (YUM) to my soy ice cream treat (I had the mint with paul newman oreos!) which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed. This place is ridiculously good. And reasonably priced. And fresh. And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway. Basically, this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near... Tempe. Which fortunately we do not, but I have to say, you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green. And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ!! :D"}
{"text":"Not much of a vegan food fan but decided to try it on whim. Things you do when you are far from home.  The staff was very friendly and the surroundings have a bohemian feel. Visited at night on a weekday. It was fairly full.  I ordered the jerk tofu salad to go. I really enjoyed the taste of the dressing and the flavor it infused in the tofu. The only thing I found odd was the following:  It seems they are interested in reducing waste and polution. they packaged  my salad in cardboard packaging instead of styrofoam,they provided a wood fork  (which shows they are onboard witht reducing waste and care for the environment) but they put it all in a plastic bag. (I guess the SurfRider foundation rise against plastics campaign has not reached Tempe yet). Overall good change of pace"}
{"text":"I should like Green. I have been a vegetarian for over ten years and I really like when I can go to a restaurant and eat whatever I want. I like the concept of Green, but after two tries, I can say with full confidence that I do not like Green.  Atmosphere: I have no problem with the heavy hipster vibe. In fact, it reminds me of home (ATX is a hipster Mecca during South by) and boyfriend and I make jokes about the decor while standing in line. What I dislike is the \"I don't give a damn\" attitude from the staff behind the counter. The first time we went to Green, I asked the guy behind the counter for a recommendation between two items. He scoffed at me: \"I guess if I *had* to pick, I would go with the sweet and sour.\" Wow. The second time, the girl behind the counter could not be bothered to greet us. She was too busy talking to the other girl behind the counter. When she finally saw that we weren't leaving, she took our order as if it was some great inconvenience to her. Sorry, dear. (Don't worry, I will not be back.)   Food: Boyfriend and I hated the food we have gotten here. First time: He ordered the greenza flatbread pizza and I ordered the sweet and sour. The pizza was an inedible mess of waxy \"cheese\", soggy bread, and pesto. He ate two bites and pushed it away. I mostly liked my sweet and sour except for the fact it was drenched in the sweet and sour sauce. (Dear Green, I *like* the taste of vegetables and tofu, you do not have to hide those things from me. Sincerely, Liz) Second time: I ordered the No Harm Chickn Parm. I can say that the bread was good, but it's a bit too hard to mess up bread that you buy from a third party. The chickn was inedible. It tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency. I do not understand how some Yelpers said this was the best mock chicken they have ever eaten. Boca and Morning Star Farms are infinitely better (and cheaper). Boyfriend got the green hummus. He said it was good. Not worth $4, but good. The pita chips were over-fried--almost burnt. Icky.   Other:  1. The drinks are meh at best. All the drinks in the refrigerated case can be bought at Fry's or Whole Foods. Please do not waste your money.    2. There are not enough tables for the amount of people. I guess Green is to be treated like a coffee shop, not a restaurant. Plop down, claim your table, eat some noms, and surf the web. Do not leave for hours! I guess this is nice for some people, but it is impossible to get a table at dinner time. FYI  3. No AC in the \"restaurant\" during the summer. Unacceptable.   TL;DR: Waxy \"cheese\", too much sauce, inedible mock meats. Don't go."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD. The Bff sandwich and the buffalo wings are so damn good, always ask for a side of their dilly ranch. This place is soooooo tasty. The Big Wac was a bit salty for my taste but it was alright. My boyfriend even loves this place and he isn't vegetarian. He says the patty in the Bff legit tastes like chicken, its been a while since ive had chicken lol but i do know that its mouthwatering and just soooo soooo gooood. Must try for every one even if you aren't on the vegetarian band wagon!"}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more about wanting to give this place more stars!   My husband and I (just recently vegetarians) met a good friend (a life-time vegetarian) at Green for dinner last night, and WOW were we impressed!  There was a constant flow of customers in and out in the 2 hours were sat, ate and talked. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you; the line moved fast and the food was fast to come out of the kitchen piping hot  We started with the \"buffalo\" wings - the sauce was super flavorful and the dipping sauce was sooo good we ordered more to go with our meals  I had the \"Wendy Pickle\" - closest vegetarian Chik-Fil-A sandwich ever! It was so flavorful and the fries that came with it were great!  My husband had the \"Big Wac\" - vegetarian version of the Big Mac - he said it was amazing!  To finish it off we had the Dough Boy for dessert - YUM YUM YUM!!!  We cannot wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Fairly sure I weigh about 10 lbs less now that I don't live within a 5 minute drive of Green. I used to do work on those Tsoynamis! I am not vegan, but I have an egg allergy, which makes eating dessert hard sometimes :'(  Green holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever ate dinner at in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona my mom (who also has an egg allergy) came out to look at apartments with me. We were staying around the corner at the Holiday Inn in Old Town, where they recommended we eat at Green for vegan food. We then returned every day for either lunch or dinner for the remainder of our trip. Once I arrived in Arizona I used to get Green at least once a week, generally as take out. Everything is delicious, not really super healthy for the most part but I can deal with that when I am eating vegan food sometimes! I also don't think that is the goal here, I believe Green is taking a vegan twist on comfort foods and they do it well. I used to get a Coffee Tsoynami and the Calexico Burger--so good, but you'll need a siesta afterwards.  I personally prefer when not a lot of meat substitutes are used in vegan food, which is the only reason why I am giving Green 4 instead of 5 stars. Most dishes use a meat substitute like seitan or tofu, though I'm sure you can avoid this by ordering something else with beans for example. I feel sad I never went to Nami in my time out in Phoenix and when I visit next I will need to try their food out too in addition to returning to Green!"}
{"text":"We loooooove this place! If you don't know what to get, try the ranchero as a burrito, add avocado! The animal fries and crab puffs are bomb too."}
{"text":"Great vegan place, been vegan since beginning of the 2013, and I have eaten at vegan places in Philly, NY, CA prior to becoming full vegan and Green New American Vegetarian is a great place in Phoenix!  Great food.    My wife and I enjoyed the wings both times we visited this establishment, we highly recommend (make sure they give you their vegan ranch!).  First time we were there we also tried a Po Boy and it was good.  Second trip there, we had the Jerk Tofu Salad which let me tell you was some damn good tofu salad!!!  We also tried the Mac n Cheese and it was good in the sense if they did use nutritional yeast it wasn't overpowering, tasted like real mac n cheese but lighter.  We were hungry so we also ordered the samosas which were good, I thought the sauce needed more heat but that is just because I like spicy food.  Next time we are in Phoenix we will definitely stopping in again!"}
{"text":"Don't call in your order expecting for this to make the process faster. You still have to wait in the very long line when you walk in to pick up."}
{"text":"Been enjoying Green for years. Sadly since the remodel the food has not been the same. A bit before the remodel when the menu changed the eggless rolls went from being a little but of heaven to being the main thing I detract people from ordering. Today my po-boy was by far the worst if had from green. It is so close & have been proud to give local & vegan my business, I'll give it a few more tries."}
{"text":"I am the reigning Duke here so clearly I love Green. However, I'm writing an updated review because Green has changed. They still get 5 stars for being all vegan, having convenient locations, green practices, friendly staff, and a mostly good menu.   They recently changed their menu and removed the noodles, fettuccine Alfredo and pesto sauces and consolidated their salad, rice bowl, and sandwich options, and made a few other changes. They no longer have a small salad, just large for about $10, but what if you just want a side salad? Not an option. Sides like coleslaw are now only al la carte instead of automatically coming with the sandwiches - not a big deal, but if you're a hungry guy you'll need more food than just a sandwich. Other than the Karma Curry, their rice bowls (Thai Peanut, Singapore Orange, and Sesame Dragon) all kind of taste the same now - like a mixture of soy sauce and sriracha and the sauce is heavy. Overall there's fewer options and we miss some of our old favs.   Plus, on and off for about a year (not related to menu changes) their tofu has had a funny taste. I mentioned it to them and they said they were experimenting. It hasn't gotten better. And it's not consistently bad so it makes me wonder if it's sometimes spoiled or they are miss-handling it. It tastes and smells like mothballs. I only get fresh/steamed tofu so maybe the fried tofu loses the mothball flavor. If you get the fresh and it happens to be one of these off batches I speak of, you will know. It's so bad I spit it out and then pick out the rest and swear I'm done with these tofu defilers. But then I order it again and hope someone else has complained and they've fixed it.   Our favs now are the Ranchero salad with wing sauce instead of BBQ sauce, Wendy's Pickle, Tahini Coleslaw, Dagobah Jungle (as a wrap versus salad), Chili, Thee Fighting Artichoke salad, and of course their Nami treats like Tsoynamis (dairy free blizzards), cookies, and cupcakes. The salads are fresh and the sandwiches are consistently good.  Like I said in the last review, the staff seem to like their jobs and they get our take-out orders right almost EVERY time, which is amazing, and there's never any accidental cheese or meat in our food. But with fewer menu options to mix things up we definitely don't eat here as often and I expect to lose my crown."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is vegan. Try them all! A lot of the items are naughty, but good. They will make things to order so you can order healthier options. We prefer the spicy peanut with brown rice and steamed tofu and the ranchero salad with wing sauce instead of bbq."}
{"text":"Much built up anticipation over this place... it's located far from my house and I don't have many veg friends, so I knew it would be awhile before I could try it out. But as a life long veggo I was super excited that there was a comfort food all vegetarian restaurant in the valley, that wasn't too strange. Finally!  It was different than what I expected inside... much more casual I guess. Counter service and fending for yourself over finding a table. I thought the decor was pretty unique and cool though.  I liked the selection of teas and lemonades. The green tea was yummy.  For starters we had the artichoke dip and crab puffs. Both were delicious but we were a little disappointed with the serving size of the crab puffs. 4 little pieces...  3 of us had the Po-Boy sandwiches. I had already tried a piece of the buffalo chicken at Devoured so I knew I would like the sandwich. They did not disappoint! All the components of the sandwich were good. The bread tasted bakery fresh and even the vegan mayo was good! It tasted just like real mayo. The shoestrings were hot and crispy, like upgrades fast food fries. My husband had the no harm chicken parm, which he thought was good but not great. He didn't like the texture of the cheese.  Kinda wish they had a liquor license... a glass of  wine or a brewsky would definitely enhance the meal. It seems like a lot of vegetarian eateries don't serve alcohol. What a shame.  We will definitely be back. There are so many other dishes I want to try!"}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced with small portions. I don't add salt to my food at the table, but even I needed to ask for some from the kitchen. Fries served lukewarm, so sent them back, but a fresh plate of them were quickly supplied.  Worth a try, but not a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian and this place was fantastic.  I didn't miss the meat AT ALL. I had the peanut noodle bowl with fried tofu and my family had meatless chicken sandwiches.  We had the meatless chicken wings as an appetizer - they were spicy and flavorful.  As a bonus, the restaurant has a fun vibe.   I'd definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I'm a Los Angeles native and have access to some of the best vegan food in the world. That said, my \"vegan-restaurant-expectations\" are pretty high! (^?^) Green delivers on all fronts and is a MUST go-to-stop for an absolutely phenomenal bite to eat. Seriously, if you're in the Phoenix or Tempe area you've got to go to Green.   My dad and I attended a conference in Tempe and happened upon this gem of a restaurant. We were impressed by the ambiance, the staff and of course the cuisine. (Side note for you gamers out there, the soundtrack to \"Zelda: The Ocarina of Time\" was on the whole time... WHAAAAT??)  The ambiance is retro and laid back, perfect for both hipsters (we have plenty of those in LA) and families. The staff is as unique and inviting as the ambiance. Our meals were delivered within minutes (for real) of us ordering, even though it was lunch time on a Saturday!   Now here's the best part, the food is AWESOME. Like I mentioned, I'm an LA native and have high expectations. Who wouldn't with dozens of highly rated vegan restaurant right in their backyard? My dad (who's more of your \"meat-and-potatoes\" kind of vegan) ordered the Kung Pao Bowl with mock beef and brown rice (spicy and yummy). I ordered the Peanut Sauce Bowl with pan fried noodles (nom nom nom). Also, we both shared the Buffalo Wings. Mock meats can be tricky but Green does a wonderful job with them, the texture is amazing! Our dishes were perfectly spiced and super filling.  Whether you're vegan or not, you'll enjoy Green!  www.VeggieSoulFood.com i.g. @VeggieSoulFood tweets @VegSoulFood"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't understand why this place has such good reviews. We wanted to try something healthy so we decided to come here and give it a try with the great reviews it had. I got the g spicy dough boy and it was alright nothing I would come back and order. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the sangria which you can pretty much get anywhere. It all seemed like a bunch of fake meat vegan junk food, I'd skip this place and try something else. It felt like I had ate vegan fast food but with a fat bill not worth it!"}
{"text":"Such a great vegan place, me and my boyfriend go here every time we are close. Only tried the big wac and fries so far but it was soooooo good. Please open one of these in gilbert!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely vegan comfort food. It's greasy and heavy, but that's what is awesome about it. If you are craving those foods that you miss, this is the place to go. I always have to get the big wac because it completely reminds me of a big mac. It satisfies that fast food craving. This place has even pleased non-vegetarian/vegan, picky eaters."}
{"text":"First visit here!! Customer service was awesome and food was OUTSTANDING!!! Will definitely be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least a handful of times in the past 2 months and it's quite delicious!!"}
{"text":"I am a meat eater so when someone told me about this mock chicken sandwich I had to try it. We arrived to a pretty packed house it looked like a pretty hip crowd of people. Everyone was really friendly and nice we both ordered The Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich (Mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in our espresso BBQ sauce with vegan mayo) served with the thyme fries. This tasted just like I was eating chicken I was shocked really good sandwich fries were great as well. Will go back for sure.."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place, I flew in to Phoenix for business and thanks to Yelp I found this great with reasonable prices even better than what we have in LA !! Had the Chicken BBQ Burger !!!"}
{"text":"Came into down just for a few days. So glad I found this place. Cute and inviting atmosphere.  The service was friendly and fast. The best part was the food, I tried a few things on the menu. Everything was delish!! Booked marked this place and will definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill in the past year. My first few experience were wonderful, but recently service and quality has not improved and even the portions have gotten smaller. Disappointed in the direction they are going."}
{"text":"While I'm not vegan, I can't help but love a guilty pleasure at Green every once in awhile. Everything tastes like real meat food I would typically enjoy, which makes a meatatarian like me happy, though I'm not sure if vegans like that or not, but am assuming they do.  The dry sodas they sell and their homemade lemon and limeades are amazing. One of my favorite reasons to come there.  While I always leave extremely full and satisfied, I can't bring myself to make this a routine part of my lunch rotation; everything seems to be overly processed in order to look and taste like what it's not."}
{"text":"I love the big wac, which is similar to the Macdonalds  big mac. The big wac is way better than the big Mac. I also had the animal style fries, which were so good with the sautéed Onions on it! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tasty dinner!  Best bet is to go with the crispy tofu, even if you are normally a meat-eater, and fake \"chicken\" will distract from how great the rest of the food is!  Loses a star for service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the quality of the food or service. The ordered mock chicken tacos. 10 minutes after eating, I was sick and in the restroom the rest of the afternoon and night. I'd never eat there again."}
{"text":"This was great!!  Even if there were a lot of vegetarian options in the area.  I've been vegetarian my whole life.   Great variety! Will def go again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is the burner! I am not even vegan but I love eating there. Their ice cream is out of this world and their food tastes amazing. The place is fairly simple but it still gives you a nice feeling when you there or you can just call in and take the food with you. The waiters are great and you feel comfortable talking to them. An absolute must if you live in scottsdale"}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant in all of Phoenix. And actually the best I've ever been to, well...ever. The Buffalo \"wings\" are my favorite item on the menu. That's been one item going vegan that I miss, and to be honest; I think the vegan are better than any \"real\" ones. The big wac, extra pickles and the Wendy pickle sandwich are my favorites. My husband loves the big wac, of course, and then the philly sandwich. The cookie dough to take home is where it's at though. This place is perfect for a new vegan and someone missing those comfort foods. Perfection!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times the food was good. There menu is a nice break from traditional vegan fare. I like the vibe of this place. The community style seating with the long shared table is a nice touch, but they also have smaller tables if you want to get some privacy. The food also comes out really quick so this place makes for a great lunch location if you are in the area and on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Um, I always end up feeling like I should recommit myself to fitting into those skinny jeans every time I see the scene at Green. And it is a scene.  But then I'm also compelled to order those Thyme fries with my veggie burger. What's a girl to do?  Good food :)"}
{"text":"Green's food is good enough to turn me vegan (just kidding i love meat)! But seriously, before ever trying Green, I thought \"how can this vegan crap possibly be any good?\". Eat here, you'll understand. The \"no-harm\" chicken parm is out of this world, as are the \"burgers\" and the buffalo chicken wings. I've never had a bad dish here, and the texture of the faux meats are strikingly similar to the real thing... if I didn't know any better, I'd swear it was!   Save room for dessert! The Tsoynamis are a vegan version of a DQ Blizzard, yet again somehow just as delicious, if not better!!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!! Green has been talking about a downtown location forever and it is here and WORTH THE WAIT!  Best Vegan food you'll find anywhere, and you don't have to be Vegan to enjoy it! I'm a hardcore meateater, but I'll take Green's buffalo wings and Mexicali Burger over the real thing any day!! The \"No-harm chicken parm\" is the bomb.com too!   The parking is an issue, only because of the small lot Green was built on, but again... it's worth fighting for a spot! The interior is very comfortable, and perfect for a sunny warm afternoon when they can open the large garage door at the front of the building for some fresh air!  Go Vegan!! Even if its just for one meal, and give Green a try!!"}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for pure vegetarian food in Phoenix, then this is probably the default restaurant.  We are all veg in our house, and my son's a picky eater and also a homebody, but he loves to come have their veggie burger and fries.  While I can't name all the dishes I've had there, I can certainly vouch for the BBQ chicken sandwich and burger, and I've only had one dish there that didn't excite me, but that's a pretty good track record considering the number of times we've eaten here.    Love the atmosphere here and enjoy occasionally sitting with people we don't know at the bigger tables.  As others have said, there is very little parking.  We've always been lucky and found a space, but if you can bike here, then I highly recommend doing so (so there is more parking for me)."}
{"text":"I'm a meat eater and eat gluten and all sorts of messed up things..... However this restaurant is the best in the valley. Price, quality, service and atmosphere all top notch. I have had the Mongolian, wings, hummus, salads, and last but not least big wac. All amazing I can't say enough about this place. You reading this review needs to stop and drive your silly ass over there and taste for yourself.  My favorite place to grab and go or to eat there. Keep doing what you are doing don't change anything."}
{"text":"I have their bff sandwich and brussel sprouts all the time! Favorite vegetarian restaurant in the valley! :)"}
{"text":"FOOD: I am not a vegetarian or vegan, so maybe I do not have the mindset to appreciate this place. Establishing a vegetarian restaurant is a good idea, there are plenty of vegetarians. But why is everything on their menu a mock of regular, meaty foods? Damn it, if I'm going out to eat vegan, I want dishes with REAL veggie dishes proud of being vegan, not this mock meat/cheese crap. It's like the restaurant is saying, \"We are vegen and we know it sucks, so we're gonna try to re-create all your favorite meat dishes!\" No thanks, I know there are good vegetarian dishes out there and if I want a pizza, I'll get a real pizza with real cheese! I guess this place is marketing solely to vegetarians and not regular omnivores. The pizza was horrible, and the ice cream was not the best I've had. Not good vegetarian food!  PRICE: Way too expensive for what you get. I don't remember the exact prices, but I remember questioning myself, \"Why did I pay that much for this? It has no high-priced meat in it!\"   ATMOSPHERE: Laid back place perfect for a college crowd. Easily sits large groups.   SKINNY: If you want vegetarian food, my suggestion is to get Muslim or Indian veggie dishes. They are actually tasty. GREEN offers some self-ashamed vegan cuisine that only reminds you h ow much you enjoy meat and cheese."}
{"text":"wowza! Had a great dinner here last night. We had the chicken salad with the lemon tahini dressing, the BBBQ Bacon Burger and the Thai Peanut bowl. We were both blown away by the salad. The lemon tahini dressing was perfect, creamy, sweet, tart, coating the lettuce perfectly. Then we tried the soy chicken....WOW. Jerk chicken spice, perfect texture, amazing! add it to the salad and it was our favorite part of dinner. Had two nice local IPAs to wash it all down while sitting on the patio under a star lit night. The BBBQ Bacon burger was made with seitan (which i've never had) and was delicious. The portobellos were a bit small, much like traditional white caps sliced thin on a burger and the caramelized onions were a bit too crisp but overall the texture of the burger really made it shine. My girlfriends thai peanut bowl was also very good, real peanuts in the bowl with steamed tofu. I think next time we'll change up the tofu for a sligthly less healthy flash fried tofu. Either way we're coming back here for date night."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian food in Phoenix. Mock jerk chicken to die for, save room for desert at soynami next door"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious. I have sadly since moved from AZ, but I stumbled upon Green when a vegan friend from out of town came to visit and we needed a place for lunch that offered more vegan-friendly menu items. I went back numerous times after because the main and side dishes, tsoynamis, and GF/vegan cookies and brownies were all just so tasty. The portions are filling, and you can just tell that a lot of thought and soul went into making the menu and food. The staff at the register were always super friendly. My favorite bowl was the Coconut Curry or Drunken Mongolian."}
{"text":"The recent price increases have made Green an absolute rip off.  The food has never been great quality.  More often than not, my food would be too salty or over-cooked.  With the new prices, I am definitely not going to gamble on whether Green's kitchen is having a \"good\" day.  Thanks to brands like Gardein and Daiya, I can make my own vegan junk food at home for a fraction of the price. It is surprisingly easy to make a delicious vegan Big Mac at home."}
{"text":"When Green first opened, there were few vegan options at restaurants and grocery stores.  It was worth paying a premium for the opportunity to enjoy vegan junk food.  Now, in a time where vegan options are much more prevalent, Green has raised its prices to almost fine dining level.  If the food was truly gourmet, I would not have an issue with the increase.  However, the food tends to be overly salty and is very hit or miss.  More times than not, I have been disappointed with my meal due to careless preparation (e.g. over-cooked, skimpy toppings, etc.).  Hopefully Green will start imposing better quality control standards in their kitchen.  Until then, I can easily get my vegan junk food fix by going to Whole Foods.  It is surprisingly easy to make a vegan Big Mac at home for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Coming from a city where we had 0 vegan restaurants, this place is a blessing. Tried most of the menu so far, everything has been great."}
{"text":"So tough to judge a place when you've only had one meal there...  however, I shall do just that.  I took other yelpers advice and went for more junk food oriented fare.  Had myself some fries and what resembled a philly cheese steak.  Amazing!  Totally what I was in the mood for and just perfect."}
{"text":"I've been to the other location and got confused, thinking this was that location!  What a different interior than the other; a lot more upscale looking, a nice patio, good beer selection.  But no big fat ice cream bar?  Or maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough.  Ah well, I just wanted good, not desert.  Went with the Big WAC (second time having this) and buffalo wings.  Damn, eating that Big Wac makes me feel like a kid again.  So freakin' delicious.  And they have Teese vegan cheese you can switch out for Daiya (which I eat all the time).  Sweet!    My companion enjoyed his huge chili dogs and we split the wings, loved em.  What a great ranch sauce.    I'd be here all the time (other location too) if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp(I am way overdue) and it undoubtedly has to be Green. My first venture to Green was actually before I was a Vegan, I had just transitioned to trying vegetarianism and I thought \" Wow, being a Vegan is easy!! \" Well not exactly, but Green helps - unfortunately not all Vegan food is as creative or tasty.  Green isn't a health food place but some of there items are better for you then others. But you can be sure you are not getting a stack of cholesterol/saturated fat and animal protein to give you years of bad health and interesting diseases (yep I said it).  Pretty much everything is good at Green, I can only think of one so-so meal I have ever had and it was a special.  I am convinced it was not made correctly in the first place. The Spicy Po'Boy sandwich was my 1st and 2nd meal at Green and still a favorite, all the burgers are good, pizza is decent, bowls all taste similar but are all great. Appetizers are cheap and all good(try the hummus, non-wings, crabless puffs). Tsoynamis are incredible. Most of their specials are good, and don't forget about Green on holidays when you feel like not eating an animal(like the majority of folks). July 4th this year had an excellent spread and all for $5(which went to charity of course).  I forgot about the location a long time ago, yes the strip mall is nothing special and unsightly but who really cares. The atmosphere inside has improved over the years and all the people who work there and go there all seem to be quite chill(even the meat eaters). I just wish there was a second location closer to me in North-Cen Phoenix(maybe someday)  Phoenix doesn't have a ton of Vegan restaurants, but this place rivals other Vegan restaurants in much more Vegan friendly cities. My one complaint(or hope) is that someday they won't have to call things \"mock chicken\" and \"mock beef\". I know this is to appeal to the masses and most people even in the Vegan community could care less but TVP, Seitan, etc all have a unique taste and texture and should be celebrated for that and called exactly what they are. \"Wheat meat\", \" Veggie meat\", \"soy meat\", whatever. Animal \"meat\" doesn't have the bounty on the word meat, what do you call the innards of a coconut or avocado? Ahhh now you get me, ok end of rant.  Go to Green, Carnivore or Herbivore, or anything in between, for the good food/atmosphere. Keep coming back for the reasons of why Green exists at all."}
{"text":"Went here with a colleague off of the recommendation of the concierge at my hotel. I wasn't expecting much honestly, but was very surprised by the experience. I ordered the Big Wac burger and thyme fries and fell in love immediately. It was literally the vegan version of the old school (circa 1979-1982) Big Mac sandwich from McDonalds (back when McDonalds used actual beef and not \"meat product\". My colleague had a salad that he was very pleased with, and we shared the eggless spring rolls which were also amazing. I recommend this place to anyone looking for great vegan food in a relaxed/chill and casual environment. Unfortunately the place closes at 9pm so if you're going to go, go early."}
{"text":"nirvana for quirky diets. homemade tsoynami dessert, buffalo chicken wings. put on your flower shirt and that dreads wig your brother brought you from bahamas and just go.  --staff knows every ingredient of every dish. haven for allergy prone or those just making quirky choices (sorry, vee-jees. i just don't get it) --get one of those cookies under glass at the counter. thank me later. --order the tsunami dessert special. i could almost hear my mom's ice cream maker grinding in the background. --what every indie coffee bar SHOULD be: serving healthy food made from freshly prepared ingredients. --keeps your palate on its toes at all the flavor substitutions. bloody brilliant!  eating these buffalo \"chicken\" pieces reminds me of the absolute CRAP that other places are calling meat right now, and I realize i'm WAY safer right now.  thanks for the compliment on my \"chops\". anywhere else i would have just got a frown a squint, and an unspoken \"geez. get a haircut, you slob!\" don't worry, I went immediately to the salon and they're back where they should be.  [prejudiced, judgmental observation and affirmation] to whit: i do respect your-all's choice to not eat meat. I really do! i also respect you for being just damn GENIUS intelligent. but you don't have to make this choice to earn my respect. proof in the recent majority of \"FATTY, \"ANTIBIOTIC-PUMPED-TO-KEEP-ME-ALIVE, STOOD-IN-MY-OWN-POOP-'TILL-THEY-SLAUGHTERED-ME\" _FEED LOT_ \"MEAT\".

{"text":"Awesome vegan comfort food. I love the chili fries and crab puffs. Best vegan mac & cheese. Big Wac is on point. Haven't had anything bad thus far."}
{"text":"Being the only person in the family that is vegan it's sometimes not easy to eat out with everyone. So glad for Green. Here I can eat and be comfortable. And knowing that the food is delicious that even my non vegans can eat is a bonus. Would highly recommend. Well deserving of the 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is the best! We are a family of vegetarians who are routinely disappointed on vacation. I can usually cook such better things than I can buy at a restaurant. Not true here. Interesting stuff. We got three different vegetarian bowls: two with tofu and one with fake chicken. Three different sauces. All three winners! We shared the buffalo wings appetizer. Yummy. Beer and wine a plus. Outdoor seating. Heavenly!"}
{"text":"Eh. Lost me with the price increases, menu change, and no small salads. Still love the food if you're OK with the new prices. I have a hard time getting people to go there for lunch with only the huge salads."}
{"text":"Okay it is UNBELIEVABLE how much I am in love with this restaurant. I was introduced by a friend last year, and now I go every chance I get. I live in north phx, so green is a little further away from me, but it is totally worth the drive.   I've tried basically everything on the menu but my favorite dishes have to be the secret chicken BBQ sandwich and the spicy buffalo wings. I used to eat meat but for the past 5 years I have been a vegetarian. I used to miss meat but after I found Green, I stopped having a craving to eat meat. Actually the food at Green is SO MUCH better than any other meats I've had.   My best friend is a full on meat lover, but one day I made her come with me to Green. She was a little skeptical at first but to her surprise she absolutely loved it. So even if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian, this is a must try.  oh and a little side note, the service is so amazing. The employees are so nice and caring. You can tell they really love their job. Also everything inside the restaurant is recyclable stuff.. so it is pretty interesting to look around the place while you are waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about vegetarian food done right!! Green puts a delicious innovative twist on their menu. It is a must!!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, a top 5 of mine in terms of vegan places. I come here every time I'm in Phoenix. Love everything about it including the ambiance. I've had several things but my fave are the tacos because you know it's the Southwest. They are flavorful and the sauces used are scrumptious. Any of the shake options are amazing. The cupcake and cookies are yummy. No matter what I have I love it. My highest recommendation for vegans."}
{"text":"The food is ok but service is awful.  Ordered lunch today.  Waited 15 mins.  Politely asked how much longer.  Another 15 mins..not happy..snotty one at counter says..we are busy...they should tell you before you order or hire extra help at busy times..they know lunch is busy..and so are all customers who have to get back to their jobs..got my money back and left.. $12 for small burrito"}
{"text":"We just finished having lunch at Green.  I doubt that we will go back,  After reading the yelp reviews I ordered a \"Big Wack\" when the waitress brought it to the table I asked for a slice of tomato.  The waitress went to get it and returned saying that tomato was another 50 cents.  I went to the rest room to wash my hands and found that the water was turned off.  My wife ordered a salad and said that she couldn't eat it; I tasted her salad and thought that it was OK.  The service is sub par the food is just OK (not great) we told them that this was our first time eating at Green.  They made no effort to insure that we had a nice dinning experience and the restaurant isn't particularly clean.  If you are vegan or vegetarian dining out can be difficult but I think that you can get more  value for your money else where.  In my opinion, they could and should do a better job."}
{"text":"The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!    I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.    Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.    I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for vegan fare. The Wac Burger and the Original \"G\" Spicy Po Boy are my favorites. I don't know what they put in their vegan ranch but its incredible. I wish I could buy a jar of it to take home. I highly recommend this place to vegans and non-vegans alike. The only thing I would say as a negative is ordering pickup. I have ordered to-go meals from them twice and both times certain things were missing or wrong. Double check the order before you pick up the bag and walk out the door. Other than that, its a great spot."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by stating that I am not a vegetarian. I am especially not vegan. I am a shameless meat and diary eater. But I am open to experimenting with different cuisines and always looking to try \"healthier\" foods. Green is a restaurant that I've driven by countless times and always tell myself that I should give it a try. I finally did last night, and I wasn't terribly disappointed. While it's still not food that I would go out of my way for, I appreciate the level of quality Green offers.   I decided to take an adventurous route and try the original \"g\" spicy po-boy. I consider this adventurous because the idea of mock chicken doesn't sit well with me. The real thing tastes better and the health differential is open to debate. The sandwich was decent but small. It's only a po-boy in spirit. If you've ever been to New Orleans and had a po-boy, you'd know that they are obnoxiously oversized and stuffed with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of fish or meat. What saves this sandwich is the sauce. It's perfectly hot and the tofu absorbs all of its wonderful flavor. I like that Green uses mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce. It may take away the crunchiness, but I like the taste much better. Green also goes light on the mayo, which I appreciate. The thyme fires are really good. They're thin and crispy, and the herb really enhances the flavor. They give you a lot of fries, which makes up for the sandwich being a little undersized, but I'd rather have more sandwich than fries.   Since heaven forbid I be strong enough to pass up on sweets, I also tried a peanut butter chocolate bar. Not bad. But certainly not worth its $3 asking price. It reminds me of a store-bought peanut butter rice crispy treat. I recommend only having this if you are a strict vegan.   The restaurant is exactly what you'd expect it to look like. It's dark and artsy in a hipster bohemian style that you'd find in New York's West Village. It's semi-service. Order at the counter, wait at the table, and someone brings you your food. Green may want to look into assigning their customers a number, or a pager, to place on the table. Even though I was taking my order to go, I'm not a big fan of someone walking around and yelling names (way too fast food for me). They also may want to put their menus out near the front the place. They're all at the counter and there isn't a big menu board posted. How is someone new supposed to have a clue what's on your menu if they can't see it until they make it the place where you order?   A meat eater reviewing a vegetarian restaurant is like a vegan reviewing a steakhouse. I can appreciate the place for what it is, but it's just not designed for me. Green caters to a specific clientele that needs more restaurant options like this. I'm glad that there is a place like Green in the valley. It's everything that people who live this lifestyle can ask for. If you're a meat eater hoping for something that tastes just like \"normal\" food, you're obviously going to be disappointed. I'm certainly open to giving Green another try, and would even suggest it if I were planning on dining out with a vegan or vegetarian friend."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. The buffalo \"wings\" and fried brussels sprouts are awesome! Good, fast service."}
{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale to go to Taliesin West, and was trying to stay true to my vegan diet while on vacation.  Yelp gave Green its highest rating in the area, so my wife and I went.   And we were so happy we did!   Terrific menu of super tasty, vegan food. We shared the faux bbq 'chicken' wings to start.  Super good.  Then I had a burger with 'bacon,' and couldn't believe I wasn't eating beef. My wife liked her tofu rice bowl.    And we both LOVED the tsoynami dessert.  (There we're so many to choose from, which all sounded great). We picked one with chocolate soy cream, bananas, organic peanut butter and rice 'marshmallow' fluff.  I think it was called a fluffernutter, or something silly like that.  But it was amazing.    Good atmosphere too. the place was busy with lots of college students and young couples on dates  (some stopping just for a tsoynami to go), but the counter service moved quickly.  The food was brought to the table quickly and hot. And everyone working there was nice and seemed happy.  Made for a really pleasant dining experience.    Hope they open one (or more!) of these in LA soon.  They'd be a huge hit!!"}
{"text":"this place is the epitome of vegan junk food! do not go here if you think you're coming here to be on a diet/ eat healthy food.  although there is no animal fat rendered protein a lot of the things are deeeeep fried and carb heavy. that said, the carbs are deeeelicious and they do it right!  the soy-soft serve is pure joy bliss."}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time there so i kind of knew what to expect.  Practically the only Vegan place around town, unless you count those Ethiopian places.  But i like green for the effort, tastes, and ambiance.  The variety is pretty good ranging from salads, pizzas, burgers, \"po-boys\" and noodles.  This time i had the Mexicali burger and my lady friend had the spicy peanut sause noodles (with is pretty much like a Thai noodle bowl, with mock-chicken).  The burger was sup-par.  the patty was more of a ground meat texture than a patty so it broke apart easily.  The flavor wasnt really there and it took ketchup and siracha sauce to bring it up.  The fries however very very good.  Thin cut, light and crispy.  Definitely a highlight of that meal.  as for the Thai noodles, it was pretty good too. The mock chicken was very good. not too dry and had a good texture to it...dare i say almost like chicken.  My only complaint is the price.  You really dont get for what you pay for.  the portions  are a lil small and the tofu/mock meat are far and few in between.  but still relatively inexpensive to eat, all entrees are about $10.  but we could get a lil more fries, or noodles or vegies for that much.  another complaint was didnt save enough room for the tsoynami ice creams they looked absolutely delish.  next time... next time  Pros -only vegan in town -flavorful with a good selection of dishes -cute decor   Cons: -meals a lil small for $10, but not that bad."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for four days, and I ate at Green four times, and even twice in one day. I would have gone again if I had more time before I had to get to the airport. So what kept bringing me back?  This place is all vegan and has tons of gluten-free options. They even have a separate gluten free menu that explains what they have and how to order to make sure you get what you want. They even have gluten free beer, and it's only $3. If it's busy, someone will come out to the line and start taking people's orders to move things along more quickly. And the people who work there are super friendly and helpful.  As I said, I went four times, and I ordered something different each time. My favorite was the salad with mock chicken and artichoke hearts. It was so delicious that I wish I could have it at every meal. It was a substantial salad that more than filled me up for lunch for less than $10. I tried a couple of the different po boys - one on a gluten free bun (which I do not recommend - it was kind of dry and tasteless), and one with gluten free tortillas (recommended). You can go to Nami next door for vegan desserts, several of which are gluten free.  I just love that everything is so well marked, and the employees are helpful and understanding. Not having to struggle to find something to order or to get the employees to understand my dietary restrictions was a welcome change. The fact that the food is also quite tasty made it even better.  I would gladly go here every day if there were one near where I live."}
{"text":"Outstanding find here on Yelp.  I don't know how we have missed this place in all these years.  Probably driven by it 1000+ times before finally learning about it.  Had the portabello mushroom noodle bowl while my daughter (the vegetarian in the family, sigh) had the \"chicken\" parm sandwich.  Both were great, but her fries were the big hit.    Great food, friendly helpful service, and happy customers.  Try this out carnivores, you'll be surprised.  I'm going back soon and often."}
{"text":"Terrific vegetarian food.  I ate their twice in two days during a business trip.  The menu is varied, prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.  I couldn't have been happier with the dishes I ate."}
{"text":"How they make those meatless chocolate chip cookies will always amaze me!!!   Well maybe I came in with high expectations and that led to disappointment...But seriously if I want meatballs...I shouldn't be a vegetarian...so why would I want \"mock balls\"...they were strange...I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth...The gratin dip was this liquidy green goo to be eaten with corn chips...disgusting...crab puffs...who needs pho-crab...how about a pizza that has fake cheese on it?  It was so doughy and odd...kinda like something at a school cafeteria...how is this so natural and green...fake things that are supposed to be like the real thing...how about just some great tasting food that doesn't include animal products?  Believe me no animals were harmed in creating this meal...unless someone brings home a doggy bag for Rover!!!  Ugh...I'm still feeling green from this meal!  This is a slap in the face to vegans...vegan food should be tasty and fresh...not contrived!  It's time to shine the light on this \"Emperor's Clothes\"!   I like the idea of a vegan restaurant...but I prefer the idea of great tasting food!"}
{"text":"2240 N Scottsdale Rd Tempe, AZ 85281 (480) 941-9003   We arrived at Green at 6:00, and were surprised to find the place so busy. We stood in line to order while perusing the menu. While vegetarian food is hardly new, finding a place that was totally packed and had such varied items on the menu was an new experience.  We all started out with the eggless rolls ($4.00). Crisp, beautifully made spring rolls with cabbage, carrots, noodles, and spices, served with a lovely dipping sauce. This was so good that it set the stage for high expectations for the main course, and we were not disappointed.   Most of us ordered the Big-Wac ($9.00), a perfect take off on the Big Mac*. It was offered with your choice of frys, fruit, or cole slaw. Even with your eyes open you believe this was made at the golden arches. The faux meat looked and had the texture of real meat patties. It even had special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and a sesame seed bun. It was also just as filling as the variety with meat. This came in a basket filled to overflowing with pencil thin French fries with what had to be homemade ketchup. The only word that comes to mind is delicious.  One of our companions ordered the kung pao bowl ($8.50). While he said he could taste the difference between the faux meat and the real thing, he none the less said it was very tasty and enjoyed it.  A number of us ordered dessert. A large cup filled from the bottom first with cookies, then homemade banana ice cream, and topped with whipped cream. I could not finish either my burger or my dessert.  Beverages are all non-alcoholic, with assorted teas being the only option for those who cannot have sugar.  The premises were clean, and tables were bussed almost as soon as they were emptied. Service was prompt and courteous.  3 stars for quality of food, service, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Nebraska and this place is really good.   So far here is what I have eaten, I would recommend all of these.  peanut chicken - Awesome  thee fighting artichoke - Awesome  classic burger - Awesome   Tomorrow I am going for the Big WAC :)"}
{"text":"Bern here a couple of times.  One star lost because service is less than inspiring. I can't bring myself to give it four stars only for the bowls I've had. I *can* for the chili cheese fries however."}
{"text":"So I've never actually had the food at Green - but from what I have heard people love it! I personally go to Green for the tsoynami! I know nami has a free standing location but Green is close to where I live and the people there are always so nice! All I have to say is that if you've never had tsoynami, you have to try it. It's dairy free, and sooooooooo good. I'm not technically dairy free, but I do try to limit my intake of it - which is why nami is perfect! I'm a HUGE ice cream lover and would choose nami over any other frozen treat... it's that good! You choose your base (vanilla, chocolate, or swirl) and then choose what goes in it. They have many creations available on their menu. My go-to is vanilla banana cream pie, add peanut butter. I've been coming here for about 3 years now and it never gets old!"}
{"text":"Excellent healthy choice for lunch however it is not cheap/inexpensive like Yelp labels it"}
{"text":"3/17/10  I know it's been awhile since I was last here, although not quite as long as sixteen months!  I see that the decor has changed yet again-- last time major add I knew of was the painted poetry on the wall next to the restroom.  There are now car door cutouts-as-art lining two walls near the front of the resto, along w/ a couch, or two.  Eclectic, and a nice add to the vibe that Green already exudes.    Tried the crab puffs again (it's been awhile since I last had them).  Wished I didn't.  Don't know if it's the ingredients in the vegan cream cheese (it contains corn/derivatives), or the fact that they're deep-fried (not all fried items make me queasy after), or both, but I'm not going to order these again.  I should've just thrown them away, but the crunchiness of the wonton (have I mentioned that I love crunchy-munchy foods?) and the cost of this app, $4 (or $1 a pop), made me plow on.  Never again.  The original \"g\" spicy po-boy made me forget my disappointment, however, as I crunched through the scrumptious mock chicken and its lovely and indeed spicy buffalo sauce!  Three battered buffalo mock chicken patties nestled between tomato slices, arugula, and Green's amazing vegan mayo on a toasted vegan hoagie roll, along w/ a side of thyme fries... Mmm... a must-try!  Seeing others enjoying their tsoynami sundaes made me want to get one myself, so after some deliberation, I decided on one of the daily specials- Death by Chocolate: vanilla soy ice cream w/ vegan brownie chunks, Newman's Own chocolate wafer crumbles, and vegan chocolate syrup.  Undeniably choco-licious, but something was amiss... I believe I was wishing for a colder sensation that regular ice cream offers and that soy ice cream cannot deliver.  It wasn't a warm day, and the tsoynami sundae that was delivered to me already had that sheen that regular ice cream develops when it's allowed to sit around and melt.  Don't get me wrong- it's the combination of cold/ solid and slightly melted and slippery that makes a frozen dessert a success for me, but tsoynamis generally make me wish I'd saved the calories and visit a gelateria, instead.  Which, as a non-vegan, I will.  Next time.    While the app and dessert left me wishing I didn't indulge, the \"g\" spicy po-boy indubitably made my tastebuds sing.  I'll just have to stick w/ the artichoke gratine and say sayonara to tsoynami in the future.  Don't the photos look divine, though?"}
{"text":"We were surprised to the find out about this place; It was packed when we arrived for lunch on our way to SD. Wouldn't never expected there is such a great vegan place like this in Phoenix!   The setting is very casual and the staffs are really friendly! We really like it! Too bad we don't live in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food, and staff was super friendly. My meat and potatoes mama even loved eating here. Great spot for plant based junk food. I had the Wendy's pickle, and thyme fries (YUM). Indoor seating is minimal, but there is a ton outdoors (weather permitting). Bathrooms are FREEZING (I suggest you hold it). My only issue was the lack of parking, as you literally park alongside the building, in what looks like a drive-thru. Will definitely be visiting next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mr:  get the big wac...just do it,  don't even think about it, get it!  We have had many things here and everything has been amazing, this by far our favorite vegetarian restaurant we have ever been to!  Nough said"}
{"text":"I love it! My new fav. restaurant!! Big Wac taste just like a Big Mac, Curry bowl is my favorite, thyme fries are great, crab puffs were delicious, buffalo wings super tasty, chili fries could have been better but were still very good!"}
{"text":"My partner and I had just become vegetarian last month and I've searched for a vegan/vegetarian restaurant and yelp found me this place. This place rocked our socks out! We took a risk to try infamous spicy buffalo \"wings\" and we loved it to death! It tastes exactly like a regular chicken. The buffalo sauce was at it's perfect spiciness. As for meals, I ordered original \"g\" spicy po-boy with thyme fries and my partner ordered secret BBQ chicken sandwich with thyme fries. We both loved them and eat them all up! Absolutely delicious! And the staffs were so friendly and knew how to communicate with us in a heartbeat because we both are deaf. We are coming back no question about it! We will try Nami's their little sister 100% vegan bakery. You need to take your friends over here!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick restaurants - vegetarian or not -- cool atmosphere, great staff, and very tasty menu items---I always get the ranchero salad with buffalo sauce instead of bbq and its delicious"}
{"text":"Vegetarian or not; doesn't matter!  My first \"GREEN\" experience was in downtown Phoenix.  I was driving around the neighborhood on break and saw this cute little building with the word \"GREEN\" on it.  Being vegetarian, I thought, \"they'll have something for me\".  I went in and that was all they have!  I was in heaven!  I got the Coconut Curry Tofu Bowl for two days in a row and found the other \"GREEN\" in Scottsdale.  Their food is perfectly flavored and I love the hippie atmosphere.  It's always cool to just sit back and enjoy a great meal here.    **If you're not vegetarian/vegan, you've gotta try this place.  It just might change your mind!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Green for years and I found out that they are opening a new location in Phoenix. This is good news because my friends and I are fans of this place. The food here is awesome and another great thing about Green is they try to be eco-conscious. They use biodegradable products, they serve organic and natural beverages and have stevia sweeteners!  :)    Here are some of the items that I've tried at Green. :)   1. Edamame with seasalt and squeeze of lime  2. Artichoke Gratin - Very easy, tasty and flavorful 3. Green Hummus - Yummy! 4. Eggless Rolls - Not a fan. :( 5. Samosas - Good. Similar to indian restaurants 6. Jerk Tofu Salad - Very healthy even without the faux meat or tofu 7. Spicy Peanut Salad - Very tasty 8.Drunken Mushroom Noodle Bowl - I always order this 9.Singapore Tofu Noodle Bowl  - Same here 10. Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl - My ex-roommate is addicted to this. He likes it with fried tofu. 11. Coconut Curry Bowl - Yum! 12. Diablo Red Bowl - Delish! 13. Crab Puffs.  14. Mum's Meatball Po-Boy - It was okay. :) 15. Argentine Po-Boy - Delicious 16. Tsoynami - Delicious 17. Chili Fries 18. Spicy Peanut Tofu - Yum!  I haven't tried the flat bread pizzas yet, but I'm sure I will once they open the new location."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Damon opened a second location in Phoenix.  The renovated building is beautiful and not stuffy at all, and I love the garage door that opens up. Very cool. The new restaurant is modern, simple and clean.  I love the decor and of course the delicious food. Healthy, cruelty-free and eco-conscious too!  It's one of the best vegan restaurants on planet earth. Okay..maybe the best one in Phoenix. Green Vegetarian is an excellent place for lunch and dinner. Without a doubt, If you are ready to become a vegetarian. This is an excellent place to start because the flavors are explosive!  I have tried pretty much everything in their menu because my friends and I frequent the one in Tempe.  However, it's too far from where we live, so we were delighted when the second location finally opened in Phoenix. I took a few pictures and posted them to show you what we ate this evening. Since I enjoyed the Singapore Tofu Noodles in Calgary today for lunch, I decided to try it again this evening in Phoenix.  My friend Boston ordered the Apricot Miso Bowl. He said it was sweet but delicious. I will be taking more pictures of course because I intend to eat here again and again.  The employees here are also very nice, polite and unobtrusive. I really love this eatery.  You don't have to be vegan of course to love this place. The dishes maybe vegetarian and vegan, but in no way restricted in its choices or flavor. Great place to get out of food rut and find your food groove!"}
{"text":"Strap a feed bucket on me loaded with mock chicken and I'm set for the weekend. It's that good."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The best place for vegans!!  The samosas rock.  It is so awesome that I can eat EVERYTHING on the menu.  The ice machine is hilarious.  GREAT."}
{"text":"I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.  I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original \"g\" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!  Service was friendly and efficient. _______________  Update:  12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious  12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.  12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.  12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Green! I would easily become a vegetarian if I could afford to eat here for every meal forever. The mock chicken is fantastic, I can't get enough of it, the texture is amazing. I like it way better than actual chicken, no other mock chicken can compare. Try the buffalo wings, samosas, krab puffs and curry with mock chicken, TRY EVERYTHING. And don't forget the vimto! Then head next door for some delicious pastries and tsoynamis!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan burger with bacon and thyme fries. I sort of wished the fries had a stronger thyme flavor. The vegan bacon added nothing to the burger. The burger was well constructed, really tasty for a vegan burger. The sesame bun was kinda boring. Ooo, would be nice if it was on a pretzel roll instead, although it would make that more German than American. Haha."}
{"text":"If you are a vegan or vegetarian I don't know how you don't live here.  The food is amazing here and you will feel like you are eating a juicy burger.  The berry lemonade is a homerun."}
{"text":"Very good! I had the Sesame Dragon Bowl and enjoyed it! Very impressed with this place. I was introduced to this place by my cousin who is also a vegan and am so happy she did! This will definitely be my go to spot when I'm in town. The service is quick, prices are right, and food is fresh! What more could you want? They also have this very delicious lemonade! Omg! It is to die for. You get a lot of food for your money, so this place is definitely worthwhile. The buffalo wings are also very delicious! They are made out of mushroom stems, but one could never tell, that's how good and flavorful they are! Please stop here if you can! You will not be disappointed. And not to mention they had patio seating, which is great for dogs! And they have a little bakery/ice cream shop right next door, which also has some vegan treats!"}
{"text":"Green never fails. Great quality, organic, whole food ingredients. Try the apricot miso with veggie chicken, It is incredible! The veggie burger is made from scratch and one of the best you will ever eat. Have it with a side of sweet potato tots, they are awesome and will make you feel like the cool kid in school. :) Lastly for desert they make these wonderful soy ice cream shakes called a \"Soynami\" Try the one with strawberries mixed with Cap N' Crunch berry cereal. The service is always friendly and all of the local \"Best of\" awards are well deserved. Healthy food that tastes great and will leave you smiling after you eat it. Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I am lowering my review from 5 stars to 3 because i got the thanksliving meal. I am only upset because on their thanksliving menu for desserts it said some sort of cobbler and below it a pie, so me thinking we would get both because it didn't say one or the other. I called and they informed me after i picked up on Wednesday, that apparently if you reserved for Wednesday you only get the cobbler....why didn't you have that on the paper, online or anywhere. So if i had known this i would have made my own pie."}
{"text":"I am vegetarian twice a week for religious reasons (Don't even go there) so i was very excited about this place.One lazy Monday afternoon i decided to give them a try.  I got the samosas $6 (stuffed with curried potatoes, peas, carrots and fresh garlic) served with a tamarind dip. Thai peanut bowl $8.50 (sauteed vegetables,mock chicken with pan fried noodles). Thyme fries $3 (one of the most popular items on their menu).  The samosas are an epic failure,i'd rather go to an Indian restaurant to get them. The thai noodle bowl was filling and the fries were good.The USP of this place i would say is the fact that they are Vegan and offer a Gluten free menu.The food is reasonably priced with decent portions.They also have outdoor seating.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I thought this would be a fitting review to write on St. Patrick's Day. Plus I just had lunch with a friend here yesterday and realized I had never reviewed Green. I don't come here too often since I am not a vegetarian. But when I do I am always amazed by how much flavor is in their food and how I don't miss the meat at all. The only thing keeping them from four or five stars is the fact that they don't publish the nutrition information for their menu. I suspect that the reason their food tastes so good is because it probably has more sugar and salt in the sauces than I would want. Just because it is vegetarian doesn't mean it is low on calories. But I know that is not a concern for everyone..."}
{"text":"The BEST burger I've ever eaten.....meat or meatless!!!!! It was FABULOUS!!! I highly recommend this place AND their prices are very reasonable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Green is just the best. If you're eating there for the first time I'd go with the big wac as that's kind of their signature burger. But they're all amazing and it's one of the few restaurants where I can say I've had a majority of the menu at one point or another.   But the burgers are where it's at. The fries are also amazing. They don't come with the burger anymore which is a bummer, but I'm also probably a few pounds lighter as a result so maybe it's for the best.   They have awesome specials and check out their tsoynamis as well. The one with captain crunch is amazing as is the raspberry one. Or the windmill, or... you get it, they're all pretty amazing.   They have a small selection of deserts although nothing to write home about. For that you have to go to their sister cafe, Nami. And that's a while other five star review.   Awesome employees. Good vegan food. Cool atmosphere. This place is the best."}
{"text":"Love this place and always have to visit when in the area. Would probably be dangerous if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Pretty much one of the best Vegan spots in Arizona. So delicious and thank you for your part in the push for a cruelty-free world."}
{"text":"I happen to be in town for work and as a non-vegetarian, I must say I'm quite impressed.  Short line at 12:30pm on a Tuesday (though it was raining).  I was in and out in 10 minutes.  The tables did all look full but I got my food to go so didn't matter to me.  The drunken mongolian with mock chicken is delicious.  Kudos to Green!"}
{"text":"A must for the gluten-free diner who wants variety and quality.  You don't have to be vegan to love the place.  The gluten-free menu is very straight-forward, easy to understand and there are plenty of options to choose from.   My fave on appetizers are the Mock Chicken Wings, as they are wonderful and full of flavor.  They have gluten-free buns, so you can actually get to eat a sandwich like a \"real person\", but the rice bowls are tasty and plentiful.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  You won't leave hungry.  When one has food allergies, no restaurant is totally safe, but this place comes pretty close."}
{"text":"Tried vegan for the very first time. I enjoyed it. The big Wac tasted like a big Mac...i think, since it's been decades I've been to a McDonalds. Tried the chili fries and edamane, both were delicious. Totally meet my expectations."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The staff was very friendly and seemed pretty fast.  Ordered the Buffalo wings which were small but pretty good (and pretty close to a meaty texture). I ordered the mooshu po boy which was kind of disappointing and definitely not worth the price. I've been to plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants and don't mind paying more money for quality food, but I just felt I've had better."}
{"text":"I would recommend to anyone local or out of town who is vegan, vegetarian and just plain looking for a great food experience. Food was great, relaxed vibe and staff was super friendly. Please come to California!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go!! I come here once a week with my boyfriend and their lemon pesto bowl with noodles and mock chicken is to die for!! This is great for vegetarians, vegans, and even you meat eating folk :)"}
{"text":"Oh so tasty, with excellent vegetarian and vegan dishes that can taste better than the original meaty versions.  The no harm chicken parm was excellent, with perfectly crisp breaded seasoning, flavorful tomato sauce, vegan cheese that was a very close texture to mozzarella, on a soft fresh bun.  I also tried some of the buffalo wings, which were tangy, spicy, with a nice texture similar to chicken.  I was surprised to discover that the wings are actually made from mushroom, but that explains why it was so good (I love mushrooms).  While I'm not exactly a vegetarian, I have friends that are vegetarian and vegan, and I do appreciate good food when I taste it, and will definitely go here again to try more dishes.  P.S.  Their vegan ice cream is amazing!  The coffee ice cream with coco puffs is heavenly."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service.  I had an order of crab puffs, which tasted exactly like the type you would get at a fast food Chinese restaurant.  The parking lot here is lilliputian and narrow, so large vehicles beware!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever ...got an order to go asked for extra crisp tyme fries no tyme and soggy. Chili 4 dollars for a half a cup of nasty  sauce on imitation meat with NO chili beans. Totally inedible!!!!!....the coleslaw was full of sugar inedible and Overpriced."}
{"text":"The Best!  We visited several vegetarian restaurants on our Arizona trip, and this one was the best!  The food was excellent, the service was great, and the prices were reasonable.  If we lived nearby, this would be a regular haunt for us."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan place! Get the burger and animal fries and thank me later. :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Um...I am confused with all the great reviews. Granted I am from Richmond, Va where lots of restaurants do vegan/vegetarian, and they do it really, really well.   This place is quasi-vegetarian foods. It's just mock meats...where are the black bean burgers, the lentil burgers, the wholesome vegetables?!?! Wah. I was really disappointed. This is definitely a place to ease people into vegetarianism.   I got the blackened jerk chicken pita (it wasn't spicy....?) and my boyfriend got the chicken parm (obviously not real chicken on either). Both were valiant attempts. They still failed. The fries were good, though.   I would give it only 1 star, but we did go at 8:15 pm and they close at 9. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt....  The service was also really bad. Lady didn't look at us while we ordered (her eyes were wandering around), the bathrooms are outside with no signage, and I guess you are supposed to assume you order at the counter?   I am not trying to make this overly-critical, but this place could do A LOT better in many ways. I probably won't go back unfortunately; too bad, I was looking forward to this!"}
{"text":"For vegan fare, it's passable. I liked the food, but not totally in love with it. The teas were the best though, and didn't have any dessert but it sounded amazing."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It's a super awesome vegan place to eat in a bastion of crappy fast food in Phoenix. The food here is moderately priced, it's family friendly, the staff is nice, and they have the best vegan buffalo wings I've bitten into! The wings aren't too spicy, a bit tangy, and absolutely yummy. It was busy when we got here, just a few minutes after they opened on a weekday - I suspect it was the lunch crowd, but, service is quick!  Also. Save room for vegan desert next door!"}
{"text":"green is great. im not even vegetarian and i like it. a lot.  the rice bowls . . . eh, i think i have had them once or twice.  my favorite is the argentine po-boy and the buffalo chicken wings are the bomb.   great angle to try and attract non-veggies to eat vegan/veggie food. they have \"normal,\" fried, \"unhealthy\" food. honestly, you wouldnt even know you are eating hippie food.   and make sure you get a tsoynami for desert. its like a blizzard made with house-made soy ice cream. they have like 20 flavors (different combos of mix-ins, like). but you probably want to split one becasue they are pretty big and filling, esp after you eat some buffalo chicken wings, and share some salad and a sammich.  oh yeah, i tried the pesto pizza once before and wasnt too impressed."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix and I am glad I stopped in. The drinks are house made and very tasty. The Vimto reminds me of the soda but not as packed with sugar. I love everything I have tried, especially the thyme fries. Very friendly staff and clean place makes me very happy. My new favorite vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get vegan junk food. I am absolutely in love with the Wendy's Pickle. I have liked everything I have tried here and the service is top notch. They have an excellent selection of drinks that are made in house, my favorite is Vimto which is similar in taste to the carbonated version you find in Middle Eastern stores but no carbonation. I also love the thyme fries which are shoestring style. They have other food which is healthier like the Diablo Bowl which my wife enjoys. My son loves the chicken nuggets and carrots. I only wish they had more parking. I have been here multiple times and had to leave because of no parking or extremely long lines. I guess that is what happens when the food is so good. ."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town.   Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!"}
{"text":"Awesome dining in downtown Phoenix. The worst part was trying to decide what to eat. As a visitor to the area, I wanted it all, knowing my time in Phoenix was limited. Decided on the BBQ chick'n, crab puffs and the boyfriend had the Big WAC.   Restaurant was clean and fun, outdoor seating was lovely. The cashier was super friendly and helpful as we were trying to pick some lunch items. I would recommend Green highly, and would be there weekly if I was a resident. I can't think of anything that could improve it!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Tsoynami is to die for and vegan wings! yum"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Food is super delicious, tasty, whatever you use to describe great vegan food. Give this place a try! Like now!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a great place to bring a true carnivore to prove other options. Never had a bad entree. Peanut butter fudge soynamee was a true winner. As a Vw Bug enthusiast I appreciate the art work. I am a harsh judge of rest rooms and this one isodern, clean and fun!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday Yummy. I had the mock chicken thai peanut bowl hubby had the big wac A mock burger He loved it !"}
{"text":"Lovely place in a location on 7th Street around a bunch of other cool little places to eat. I was there last weekend and had their mock buffalo chicken sandwich and it was messy but great. They use a great bread for the roll and it comes out literally burning hot so wait 2 or 3 minutes before you dig in and have plenty of napkins. They also do a variety of vegi and mock meat stir fries that I've had at their other location and though I've not had them their vegi burgers look amazing.  Parking can be a bit of an issue if it is busy but the place draws a wonderful eclectic crowd, sort of the same group that you might say, see at a showing of an independent film. Oh, and I especially like the fresh teas, lemonade, and  ginger drink that they have available and the ice maker has a wrap around of face pictures of the rapper ice cube, how cool is that baby!  I hope that one day they open another location near Mill avenue, I think it would do well and I would eat there on a much more regular basis!   Bottom line, give it a try and the other thing, the boneless mock chicken buffalo wings, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great, hip and trendy place downtown. Loved the place, but didn't care too much for the food. That being said for what it is- mostly faux meat tofu specialties (as opposed to just healthy vegetarian eating, with minimally processed tofu perhaps), it's good. It didn't blow my mind, but I liked the place, the vibe, the social consciousness and the people."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you like a crap ton of salt and oil. I suppose if you are trying to mimic real shitty food like Big Macs and fried chicken then they hit the nail on the head.  They couldn't even get the chili right- it was full of oil and salt. Just a shame.   I'd rather eat the face off a puppy than eat at this place again."}
{"text":"I like it!! Because is vegan. The older lady is the best to serve and her customer service is very good."}
{"text":"Yaaaasssssss! So much goodness - this is legit vegan food. Sadly, we vegans/vegetarians/pescetarians settle for less than not when it comes to vege restaurants. This was not the case here. I'm seriously thinking about flying back to Phoenix just for this place.   I basically did a tasting and ordered the Big Wac (so amazing - totally had that \"mouth feel\" we're searching for), the Wendy's Pickle (a little fake meat taste to be honest), the buffalo wings (spicy for my taste but still good) and the vegan chili which will soon become a late night snack.   Couldn't eat it all in one sitting of course, but had to try it! This was a Postmates delivery, so I'm sure it would have been even better at the restaurant itself.   Don't cheat yourself - visit here!"}
{"text":"If you love McDonald's Big MAC, then I highly recommend to try the Big WAC!  For someone like me who hasn't had beef or a philly cheesesteak in the longest time, I really appreciated the Chicago Cheesesteak.  For dessert, go next door to Nami's! You can get a complete vegan meal with Green's then Nami's!"}
{"text":"For anyone looking for amazing vegetarian food I highly recommend this place for their food, culture and style!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! The Burgers are Delish! The Buffalo Chicken nuggets are FAB! The Soft serve is AMAZING!  So glad my bestie introduced me to this gem! Can't wait to go back and try some more awesome food!"}
{"text":"Well, that was pretty great. I've been to my share of vegan restaurants in my life having been vegetarian for 27 years and this one is definitely among the best.   It has a cool, hippie-hipster vibe that makes you wonder if you're in Seattle or Humboldt instead. Being a lover of all things PEACE, LOVE, and HAPPINESS, this place is totally my jam.  It's an order-at-the-counter place or what we all kind of dub as \"fast casual\" or whatever. You grab a drink from the case, some vegan cookie dough for later and order your food. They hand you a number and deliver to your table. They don't have fountain soda, but awesome, homemade juices that take the place. You can buy sodas though, just fancier ones in the bottle cooler case.  We had a variety of things--mock orange chicken with veggies and rice (good), egg rolls (a bit bland but fixed that with sriracha--would've been better stuffed with more crunchy veggies and glass noodles), thyme fries (yum), veggie burger (decent, topped with high quality stuff) and the favorite, fried Brussels Sprouts with lime. It was alllllll about those Brussels, people.   I am dreaming of those, honestly. I could eat a whole dinner of just those. Mmmmm.  Definitely see the appeal and for those crispy little mini cabbages, I'd come again and again."}
{"text":"The food, the service, all amazing. People are right, the mac and sauce is delish, as are the animal fries! I also tried the Thai peanut wrap, and I still have dreams about it. Parking can get a little tight, but it's worth it. This is definitely one of the best vegan places I've tried. And when you're done, go next door to Nami for some vegan friendly desserts!"}
{"text":"This chain of side by side restaurants is wonderful. I love vegan restaurants, and this one especially because you don't even realize the food is vegan. The vegan big mac is so delicious that I couldn't put it down while eating. The BFF is my favorite thing on the menu - it's crispy, cheesy, and spicy, all in one! They also have a good assortment of drinks and great decor. Staff is always friendly and personable."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but that seems to be pretty standard for np vegetarian or vegan food. I had a large tasty salad and my beloved had a rice bowl. We both left feeling satisfied. I'd rate it at very good, but not great."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Green for years - when I lived in overseas for over a year, the food I missed the most was Green's fake chicken - the artichoke salad and buffalo wings. I deeply appreciate how thoughtful the food is and that I can bring non-veg friends here and everyone leaves smiling.   However, I am not very disappointed in the shifting menu. Before, the vegan meat was INCLUDED in the salad -- now I have to pay upwards of 30% more to add it. Moreover, the salads are noticeably smaller with less fresh greens. I've also noticed a stark difference in quality in the Tempe location (much worse quality of ingredients and much smaller portions) compared to the downtown location. As a loyal customer and promoter, the menu changes are disappointing and wallet-breaking. I really hope management reads and listens to these reviews."}
{"text":"Vegan goodies bomb!! Such a cool Vibe inside. Save seats or order first as place gets pretty packed. We came on lunch time and had to leave since in a hurry for a tournament because of packed line. We came back the day after and glad we did!! Food was great in flavor, packed in goodness earthy vegan ingredients indeed. We had the vegan peanut bowl, a great substitute for Thai flavor. The Brussels were fried just right and great tasting. Don't expect humungous portion in their somosas and crab puffs but at least they make up for taste. Animal fries was worth the guilt. When you're in downtown Phoenix, it's a couple of blocks but great vegan options indeed. Must come back again to try more."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best vegetarian/ vegan food ever! We are from Michigan and were vacationing in Arizona. We ate at both locations of this restaurant. I'm sure we went here about 4 times. The food is THAT good! We really wanted to try everything on the menu. They do a phenomenal job with their dishes. Even non-vegetarians would love it!"}

{"text":"Love it. Best vegan selection in town. Meat eaters will not be disappointed, though they should considering coming over to the good side of life. :)"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Not only is the food great, but the staff is really friendly as well. I tell myself that I'll try something new every time I go, but I typically always end up ordering the original g po-boy because it's that good. I managed to get all of my friends hooked on it as well. If it's your first time at Green, you have to try a tsoynami for dessert. I just recently had the pumpkin pie tsoynami (seasonal I'm assuming), and it's hands-down my favorite so far. If I lived closer, I'd be here way more often. They should definitely consider opening another location."}
{"text":"I had heard about Green before, and didn't realize that I had passed it a bunch on Scottsdale Rd. Me and Jon S. were meeting with someone before they caught a flight home the next day, and decided to meet over late night Tsoynamis. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and it was pretty poppin'. They place smells really good, and if I hadn't already had dinner plans I probably would have tried something off of the menu.   The guy at the register was nice, and I decided on the almond joy-esque tsoynami, with soy ice cream, almonds, chocolate syrup, and coconut. Jon had the pb&j and added vegan cap'n crunch. While we were all consumers of meat and dairy, the tsoynami's were super good. You get about 16oz of goodness, and after licking the cup clean, you don't feel weighed down as you might after eating the same amount of Cold Stone. This is definitely someplace I'd come back to, and may even be daring enough to try lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"Not only does it have absolutely delicious vegetarian/vegan food, but apparently it's also a great place for celebrity sightings.  My friend and I saw Jim from Jimmy Eat World grabbing lunch there yesterday.  Clearly, we all have fantastic taste!  Favorites: the Sweet and Sour bowl with crispy tofu ... and don't forget the organic limeade!"}
{"text":"im so disappointed not in the food but seeing wait staff wearing sleeveless shirts and exposing my food to armpit hair ....gross semi tall girl on Tuesday wearing white sleeveless shirt and black pants . thats really gross i dont want to see your armpit hair handling my food !!!! wear a sleaved shirt . i throw my order out"}
{"text":"First things first....I love meat! I will never become a vegan or a vegetarian. But I am not going to turn my nose to a restaurant that serves Vegan/Vegetarian options only.   I loved the cool ambiance that Green offers. The staff is super friendly and gave me some great options since I explained my lack of vegan knowledge. I ended up ordering the mock fish and chips. Not my smartest decision. I have to remember never to order anything with the work mock in it. It doesn't mock the real thing, I don't care what they say.   I did enjoy the fries and their artichoke dip was amazing. I even took home a very tasty cupcake.   I would come back and try something a little more reasonable, like a salad or noodles."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? I think I have eaten out here more times than anywhere else in the valley! Must try their fresh vegetarian burgers. The Big MAC is amazing and according to my husband (who eats meat) it is close and so much better than the real thing. I personally like the BBBQ burger the best. My advice get it w/ chili fries. Also dont forget to come on Sundays for brunch at nami,next door."}
{"text":"This place is tasty but it's nowhere near healthy for a vegan or vegetarian. The amount of sauce and oil drenching the food might as well just inject you with fat. It's not heart healthy nor is it thoughtful. Fat is still FAT and when food is swimming in it, it's downright insulting when you are health-conscious. And don't even get me started on their pastas and salads that would put Olive Garden to shame on its calorie and fat content."}
{"text":"My friend and I split a Po Boy, BBQ chicken sandwich and some crab puffs. I'm not a vegan but I decided it was time for something healthy. i liked the Po Boy it was quite spicy. It was almost as good as the vegan Po Boy at wholefoods. The crab puffs tasted good but I like the regular stuff. I loved the BBQ chicken though it tasted almost like regular chicken and it was really tasty.  The fries were really tasty too. The only missing star is because the atmosphere to me different I'm not quite used to it but I highly recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Great gem in Arizona!!  Their po'boy sandwiches were delicious and a great value for the price!  I was in AZ for 9 days and ate here twice!! So good!! If you love American comfort food this is the place to go!  This place is 100% vegan."}
{"text":"I was so pissed off.  I ordered the Coronado Enchiladas, the special they had last week. They were awful. If I wanted undercooked tortillas with a veggie filling, and taco bell sauce, I could go to Taco Bell. But nontheless, I paid $9.  And they did not replace my crap food for free. I ended up paying $17 total for the Mongolian... Which is good, but not $17 good.  Make sure that you are going to enjoy what you get, because them not owning up to shitty food is a bad idea."}
{"text":"Cool place, and you don't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy it. My fiance honestly thought he was eating chicken shwarma made out of chicken. I told him after we left."}
{"text":"We tried Green this past Friday night.  Yeah, we are totally fans.  A little backstory...My Wife and I have been vegan for about the last 9 months.  Our Son was out of town last week, so we decided to try a couple of new places during our \"Staycation\".  After a rather disappointing meal at another establishment just down the street, we decided to try Green on the recommendation of a server at another restaurant.  We arrived about 6:30 on Friday evening, and the first thing we discovered is that parking is not so great.  This almost made us go somewhere else, but I'm glad we didn't.  We were able to find parking on a side street and had a short walk back to the restaurant.  The restaurant was busy, but we were not deterred.  We got a menu, and got in line.  While waiting in line, I was looking around the place.  There is one main dining room with the ordering counter/drinks at the back.  Out front facing 7th Street is a nice patio, and the main room has a roll up type door for nice weather.  I also found out later, that there is a back patio that I would love try.  The place was very clean and modern; but be warned, it's loud.    While looking at the menu and deciding what to have, I was also \"window shopping\" other customers plates.  Everything I saw looked good and the portions were large.  While there was a lot of talking going on, people really seemed to be enjoying their food (a very good sign!) and not letting it sit on their plates.  Turnover was also pretty quick, people seemed to eat and go, not a lot of lingering.  My Wife and I both decided on the big WAC burger (Green's take on a popular burger from the \"golden arches\" place), thyme fries, and an order of the buffalo wings for an appetizer.  We both had iced tea to drink (there are 4 house made drinks to choose from).     While it took a little time to get our food (understandable, it was Friday night and the place was busy).  It was sooooo worth the wait.  Our burgers and fries came before our wings.  We both requested no onions, and that's how we got them.  The presentation was awesome.  The burgers and fries were hot and looked like a million bucks. The patties came to the edge of the bun, the \"cheese\" was melted, the taste was phenomenal.  The burger was huge.  The fries were crisp and not greasy.  I'm trying not to use too many exclamation points so my review doesn't get canned, but I could put them after every sentence, the food was just that good!  We both felt like we were cheating.  The only let down was the Buffalo sauce.  When our wings arrived, they looked great and smelled good.  The texture was spot on and they were sized nice, but neither of us cared for the sauce.  Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist when it comes to wing sauce, but I would try them again.  Overall, this was a fantastic experience and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Green to anyone.  Vegan or not.  Great job Green!  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I've never had something here I didn't like. My husband is very much NOT a vegetarian and he loves this place. Their mock meat is incredibly real tasting. His go to is the Big Wac. I usually opt for the Spicy Peanut Chicken Salad. We took a Cheese Burger and fries home for our 15 yr old son and he had no clue it was mock meat.  Staff is awesome and service is fast."}
{"text":"This is the best location to get vegan food that I have found in Arizona yet.  Especially if you are a newly turned vegetarian or vegan this will help you ease your way into the lifestyle as Green offers a great variety of foods that you will sure to miss.  I would recommend Green to even those who are not vegetarian or vegan, its a must try."}
{"text":"I love a good vegan find and if you're ever in Phoenix, make sure you come here!!!   The place is super cute even though I stopped here on my way to the airport so I didn't get a chance to sit down and eat.   I got their famous Big WAC, the vegan version of a Big Mac and let me tell y'all.....I side eyed questioned if it wasn't actually real meat! It tastes just like an actual Big Mac!!! But what was 10x better about it was 1- you're not eating any actual animal products, 2- there is none of that McDonalds food after taste that used to linger for hours (belching not included) and 3- you didn't get that \"omg I'm going to pass out I'm so full\" feeling after you ate it.   The Big Wac with a side of thyme fries and a berry lemonade really makes you question how important IS that flight you're about to catch. Maybe it could wait the savoring of such a surprisingly delicious HEALTHY fast food meal.   And side note, Amy fiancé, a non vegan, took a bite (which turned into a few) and he himself could not believe it was actually vegan. So whether you are vegan, or not, this place is a must!!! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG ... If you are asking yourself \"should I go here or there\" GO HERE!!! I wasn't sure what I wanted, the young lady at the counter was so helpful and I took her advice and got the \"Wac Burger\" it was everything and more than I expected! Also got the banana cream soy ice cream parfait.....I almost died! Already planning on going back for dinner tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"After a weeklong vacation to Arizona, and three visits to Green within that week, I can say that this is the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant I have ever been to.  Tried a few new dishes this week including the mexicali burger, the artichoke gratin, the buffalo wings, and three flavors of tsoynamis.  All were so good.  The wings were delicious and amazingly \"real\" in texture and taste.  The tsoynamis are freakin' awesome - the first one I had a few years ago, I didn't really think the texture was quite right.  But I definitely think its exactly like a blizzard but with better flavors, like fluffer-nutter (pb, banana, marshmallow fluff. yum)  But nothing beats the old standby of a no harm chicken parm with chili fries on the side.  The fries are the best fries ever, and the chili is so good.  The no harm parm sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it.    Like I said before, if they opened up in my neck of the woods, I could totally be vegan."}
{"text":"Green is the spiiiiizzzooooot for vegan - which I am not. However, an O'G Poboy and peanut and chocolate soynami hits the spot anytime - give them a shot, and keep an open mind to vegan."}
{"text":"Best vegan meal I've ever had, hands down! The chicken wings appetizer was awesome, I didn't even realize I wasn't eating real chicken! I had a curry dish with brown rice and it was very delicious, my fiancé's dish was great too, something with mock beef, I forgot what. The drinks were good. The desserts were great! I had a Soynami with \"Betterfinger\" mixed in (think of a blizzard at DQ) and it was SO good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love Green and Nami both!! I come to green multiple times a week and am always helped by Diana, she is the best!! I take comfort knowing everything is vegan and there's no contamination of meat stocks etc.. hiding in my food, I have had experiences at other places where I find a random piece of meat in my food! Not here!!! The food is consistently good and the service is always great! Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Good food but it was way too oily/ fatty for me. Everything was pretty much deep fried but I enjoyed what I ordered. (Fish tacos, buffalo wings, egg rolls)"}
{"text":"So far, this place is the best vegan resto that I've ever meet. The menu have a lot of option. I tried the green salad (awsome flavor!), spicy fried tofu with peanut sauce (it reminded me to my Indonesian peanut sauce!). Bravo! I can't go back to try others menu. Total 3 orders was $$..:)"}
{"text":"A new place for vegan with so many options! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Green has stepped it up. Went today for lunch and the food was delicious. Ordered the wings again, so spicy and wonderful, this time I went with the \"meat\"ball sandwich, the marinara was very good and the ratio of cheese to meatballs - perfect. Think Mama Mia's meatballs, great consistency.  I also really enjoyed the fruit cup it came with, it had pears.. Pears on a fruit cup are rare.  The beverage selection was also great, green tea freshly brewed and all sorts of green, organic sodas. I will be going back for lunch. (Even if I could make it in my own kitchen)."}
{"text":"The first few times I liked the food but the last two times I ate here, the food wasn't that great and additionally I didn't feel too good after eating here. I think the burgers are good, but the noodle dishes weren't that impressive. Even then, there are better veggie burgers in town. It's definitely a great idea,  the service is fast and friendly, place is spacious and clean but I think some work is needed on the food items. One thing I would come back for is the shakes, they are definitely worth a trip and their lemonades are pretty good.   Get the burger, lemonade and their ice cream shake as dessert, avoid other items."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place after numerous drive bys. This place is delicious. It's all vegetation but there's options that will please everyone. The Brussel sprouts were spot on and yummy! Try something new and this place is it!"}
{"text":"Never dissapointed  I love that it is Vegan  My son likes the hummus  I like the karma curry"}
{"text":"Had the big wac of course! umm yeah it taste just like a big mac! messy like it too so be prepared for that. was delicious, and I eat meat and I couldn't taste the difference."}
{"text":"This place has it all:  inventive combinations,  ability to customize your meal, fresh from the farm vegetables and tasty vegan options!  The lines of satisfied customers are proof that this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome vegetarian restaurant (although I'm not the best critic being that I'm a meatatarian, but maybe that's saying something in itself). I went here with my girlfriend and her pescetarian mom and I admit that I was a little iffy at first, but is was soooo gooood!  Meat fans, seriously give this place a shot. I'm saying this as a person who would wear a bacon strap wristwatch if someone invented one. They have things like Big Macs, wings, noodle dishes, just so many different kinds of food but there is no meat--just very close imitations of meat. You'll be able to get the savory taste of what you are craving and not feel like you're in a food coma afterwards. Whether you're into spicy food, basic foods, they have a great selection as well as a fridge full of many different types of sodas and drinks that are out of the norm.   I love the decor and the layout of the restaurant, but the location is a bit strange and some of the employees (repeat: SOME of the employees) are straight up arrogant. Being a restaurant like Green in a state like Arizona is a tough feat, so the staff should be more welcoming and not as smug. The person who ran our food was very friendly, however. She had cool tattoos running up her arms and a huge smile on her face--she basically saved the day as far as service goes.  Again--meat lovers--you don't even have to step outside of your box to enjoy Green--order the wings or burger you want and enjoy (warning: you may have flatulence afterwards)."}
{"text":"If your goal is to eat stuff, but avoid a place that serves meat, then this is your spot.  However, if you seek decent food that holds up to comparison with actual restaurants rather than your high school cafeteria, then you may be disappointed.  This is truly mediocre, yet totally veg, fare."}
{"text":"I wanted it to be so much better but it was just barely ok.  Really they're only getting 3 stars because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and vegan options are limited as it is, so I always root for vegan restaurants to do well.  The flavor was pretty much there but the execution of dishes was lacking, sorry to say.  My friend and I ordered the fried won tons which were way too dark.  We also ordered dip (spinach/artichoke?) which was way too runny.  I ordered the golden arches style burger (forgot what it was called) and it had way too much special sauce on it which dripped out of the burger and made the texture too soft throughout (trying not to say mushy here).  We went Saturday night 1/28 and while it was busy and obviously popular, the food seemed like it was made by their second string cooks and we could only assume that their top staff had the night off maybe?? It's a bummer because we were only in town for that weekend anyway, but I really wanted to love it since their menu sounded so old fashion diner style good."}
{"text":"Green is REALLY great for non vegans, vegans who miss meat, or transitioning vegans. Personally I would like to see more seiten and falafel on the menu. All the fried food and fake meats/mayo/fake animal product really turned me off, but that said, it is called green American food so I think it's just my bored taste buds and dislike of meat and American food. I get the peanut or curry bowl expecting thai food quality, and it's just not that. It's a substitution for real meat and at that they do a decent job, I'm just not into it."}
{"text":"Very clean. Consistently environmentally friendly down to the Meyers hand soap in the bathroom. I took my carnivorous husband here for lunch. We wound up selecting bar food, animal fries, hummus, wings, and spinach dip. He loved the wings; great texture with a delightful flavorful sauce and dip. We both loved the hummus, super fresh with a little kick. The chips it comes with were yummy, not heavy at all. The spinach dip was weird, almost had a chemical flavor to it, we wouldn't order that again. The animal fries were naughty, in the best possible way. We will definitely be back, for some healthier fair. Service was friendly, like you were eating over at a friends house. The decor and music is \"old Mill avenue\", chill, hip and fun."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this place on Yelp! It was my first time and walking in the place I knew that it was for me! Very fresh, colorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Two words for you- ANIMAL. FRIES. This dish is a must have!  First time eating here and the service was fast and friendly. The menu is a bit long, so the fear of picking the \"right thing\" was rising.  When my burger arrived, the patty was very thin. The flavor was still there and complimented the fries.   Overall I really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  The staff is always fantastic The place is always clean The food is always as good as the last time I love a place where I don't have to worry about cross contamination of animal byproducts thank you guys so much for being in Phoenix and being so awesome"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...wait, beyond amazing! The truffle fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and the chocolate almond milkshake was the perfect guilt free dessert. It's a 30 minute drive from my work but totally worth the journey. I'm making it a point to eventually try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I gave Green a chance after banning it from my already incredibly small list of vegan friendly restaurants. I was shocked at how expensive everything was for such small portions. $7 for four samosas? Maybe you could fool some people who are vacationing in veganism but it's not going to fly with me.  The food was fair. Just fair. The sauce for my samosas was almost disgustingly sweet (no chutney?). It took a ridiculously long time to get my main meal out and I was disappointed to find that it was /really/ greasy. I understand that the point of Green is comfort food but excuse me if a quarter cup of grease just makes me sick.  After dinner we popped over to Nomi where I tried the BFs twinkie which had an incredibly dry cake and unfathomably greasy cream (which I think has more to do with how long it had been out and how they decided to store the cakes rather than how it was made).  The only good part of this time's visit was that I could stomach the food. Last time I went there I had a lemon slice on my freaking pizza. Who the hell puts lemon on a pizza??  I don't think I'll be going back. If I want Asian food I'll go to Loving Hut otherwise I'll be making things myself. It's not worth the price nor the taste to be ignored while surrounded by artsy fart \"hollier than thou\" attitudes among fellow vegans."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurant I have ever been to. They don't skimp on anything. From the buttery crispiness of a toasted bun burger, to the juicy taste of their chicken wings, it hits the spot every single time. I really don't know what to recommend... probably just order the whole entire menu??? If you are plant-based and longing for the taste of old fashioned bar/diner type of food without all the grease, this is the place for you. The hip atmosphere is also really fun to be a part of."}
{"text":"WOW! I grew up on meat and lived in Texas and love the taste and texture. I became a vegetarian and always have craved a burger....so my roommate brought me to Green and the Bic WAC IS OUTSTANDING! I can't believe its not meat. The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh. I also loved the samosas...much better than my fav indian restaurants...not greesy at all but very crispy!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the west coast! I love and miss this place. All the foods in the menu are great as well but my favorite hands down is the Big Wac. When I come to town to visit I know where my pit stop will be at."}
{"text":"Love love loved it! I've had the opportunity to sample their food at local festivals but this was my first time to the restaurant.  Seating options include inside and two patios- a louder one off of 7th street and a quieter on at the back of the restaurant.  We ordered the hummus and the chips were perfect accompaniments.  We also spilt the secret BBQ chicken sandwich. Okay this is where I tell you that I am not a vegetarian but thought this was amazing! Also ordered a side of the curry past salad- good add on."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always packed and always recieve friendly service. Really cool specials and craft beers. Parking can be tricky here, theres only so many spots behind the restaurant but i have always lucked out and found a spot .Majority of their food is heavily mock meat based but its all pretty yummy. Clean chill restaurant with alot of personality and im all about supporting vegan restaurants. The big wac is my favorite but this time i got the bbq wings salad with a tangy ranch dressing and crispy tortilla chips. Light but filling, veggies were fresh and wings had lots of flavor. I think ill do the wings in buffalo sauce next time though, i think it would go better with the dressing. I sat out back on the patio under the tree and it was pretty relaxing.also, love the varieties of house made ice teas! I mixed some of the sweet ginger tea with some lemonade and dangggg, so refreshing! I will be back as always! Cant wait to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Amazing little hole in the wall vegan restaurant!  Went on a Tuesday night with a friend and it was packed!    The cashier was very friendly and helpful.  Their credit card machine wasn't working and she was very apologetic.    Started off with the crab puffs and artichoke gratine.  So delicious!  Hard to believe this stuff is all vegan!?!    For the main course, I had mum's meatball po-boy with thyme fries.  My friend ordered the singapore tofu.  Both were really good!  The singapore tofu tasted like thai food.    For dessert, we both had a soynami.  They were huge!  And very good.  They're kinda like the Dairy Queen blizzard's but made with soy instead.  Green is also a great place to people watch.  So many different types of people came thru.  It was very interesting to see.  I definitely recommend Green.  Even if you're not vegetarian."}
{"text":"Carnivores have their comfort foods, why can't vegans too?   But it's funny that carnivores don't take in meats tasting like vegetables, but the vegans take in foodstuffs tasting like meat. Hmmm....  Squirrel!  Anyways, I was in the vicinity of some green unhealthy new americans and decided to finally try Green restaurant. It's popularity proceeds it and after reading the menu online, there were a couple of dishes I wanted to try.  Mainly the Dagobah. Day-go-wha? Yeah, Dagobah. Actually the full name is Dagobah Jungle ($8.75): jerk spiced fried brussels sprouts over fresh greens tossed in jamaican jungle dressing with carrots and crunchy tortilla strips. That's how I ordered it but the cashier also gave the choice of having it in a burrito.   Daay-oh. Day-ay-ay-oh! Dagobah come and me want to eat it all. It arrived to the table in a large bowl with ample brussels and a decent portion of salad. On first taste of the dressing (I think it was tahini based) the sky must have parted and heavenly light shined down on me. It was delicious and made me forget about the jerk seasoning which was completely AWOL. Too bad, because now that I think about it, spiciness in this dish would have probably sent me UP to heaven.   I also tried the samosas ($6.75): curried potatoes, peas, carrots and fresh garlic wrapped in a thin fried pastry with tamarind dipping sauce, says the menu. Well...four small samosas came on the plate in thick crispy fried dough with - maybe - two cubes of potatoes in each one. Curry? Couldn't taste it. Garlic? Couldn't taste it. Carrots and peas? I'm pretty sure I would have been able to spot them -- if they were there. But they weren't. Did I already say AWOL? i would not order these again.   Oh yeah, I also had the animal fries ($5.75) which are supposed to be potatoes seasoned with thyme and smothered with melted cheese, grilled onions, and 1k island sauce. These were really good, but thyme was not on my side? It was AWOL.  Are you seeing a pattern here?  So, overall, even with all the absent flavors, the dishes were good. Nothing was too oily or over done. Portions were generous, much better than I'm used too. I would like to return and try the Karma Curry,   If I could change only one thing, it would be the onions on the animal fries. Onions flavor was weak and they were chopped very small, almost insignificant. If it wasn't for the sauce I would not have liked them as much."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, you already know about this place. If you're looking to take a vegetarian somewhere -- this place is a sure spot. Best veggie/vegan cuisine I've ever had."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly after 8:30pm to realized they closed at 9:00.  No worries as they were quick to say, \"Come on in!\"  Prior to our arrival we didn't know if Green was a sit-down or counter service.  Upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience.  Nice and laid back. I immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats.  Patio dining is available but the far end also has a see-through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too.  Quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything.  It's so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren't.  I settled on the Mexicali Burger.  However, when I went to order I noticed the special....\"The Big Wac\".  What?!  This is what everyone has been talking about in the Green Facebook Group. You see, The Big Wac is basically the vegan version of the Big Mac.  It's not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it.  I made the quick switch, ordered the Big Wac with fries and my husband ordered the Kung Pao bowl.  Did the Big Wac live up to the rave reviews? Yes, and more! Although I admit I was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers I've had in my life.  Seriously.  My husband's meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the Big Wac too. Partnered with the yummy thin fries I had the perfect meal.  I can't wait to return to have another fantastic meal!"}

{"text":"Haven't been here in over a year. What the hell, price increase that is slightly ridiculous high for what you are getting! The food quality seems to have changed too. Makes me kind of sad to see this happening. Oh well, sign of the times I guess. God Damn honey badger!!!"}
{"text":"I am an avid meat eater - I love love love beef! My vegan friend had a birthday dinner at Green and was advised to try the burger. I was highly skeptical of this advice because of course I've tried veggie burgers before and they never imitate the real thing very well. Well I was ASTONISHED! Green has perfected the art of fake meat - the burger was delicious and I could not believe that I was enjoying a veggie burger! It was even pink inside. Perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Today I took a continuing education course at Sky Song which lasted for 8 hours. I knew the snacks I packed would only hold me over for a couple of hours. i was pleasantly surprised when a classmate found this place.  I ordered the samosa appetizer that came with a cinnamony dipping sauce. This is the first time I've had samosas that were not heavy & greasy. My main meal was the lemon pesto with mock chicken (carrots & zucchini were thrown in). Everything taste sooooo good. The pesto was so lemony and the mock chicken taste like chicken. It's been a really long time since I've had chicken and I hadn't realized how much I missed it. I'm taking another continuing education course next month and can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to take away stars, but I must. The website does not show which exact menu items are gluten free, but I know there are some so we decided to go there for lunch. I am mostly vegan, sometimes vegetarians and all the way gluten intolerant. I decided on the \"chicken\" nuggets with fries. I chose those items because there was a GF next to them. I confirmed with the cashier that those items are in fact gluten free. No they are not!!! While wheat has not been added to the products, they are cooked in a fryer that has had wheat products in it. Total cross contamination. The \"chicken\" nuggets and thyme fries are totally confusing and should NOT have the GF next to it. I ended up ordering a brown rice bowl with curry veggies. It was good but not at all what I wanted.  Please have 2 fryers in the kitchen, 1 for wheat products and 1 for non wheat products.   For my gluten free friends, please confirm that your dish is in fact gluten free. I would hate for you to get sick."}
{"text":"Big Wac is better than a Big Mac hands down. Had no idea what to expect going to this place walked away very impressed with the food and experience.  We started with the wings which are were very flavorful and delicous. Then split a salad that had charred brussel sprouts. Finished with the one and only big wac which was very filling and a good value for the money. Whole bill for 3 items and an izzy drink was 25 bucks not bad. I like the fact its a fast casual set up where u order at the counter and they bring the food. Def a cool hipstery spot and a place I'd come back to!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Green with Brady K.  Given the fact that this is a vegetarian restaurant, they don't serve meat. (No shit, right!)  Anyway, I was absolutely amazed at how this place prepares food like chicken wings that aren't really chicken.  Brady K. had the green burger and he loved it.  I had the BBQ Po-Boy and it was awesome.  I'm still trying to figure out what was in this sandwich.  It looked like pork.  It tasted like pork.  But it wasn't pork!  This is killing me!  The pasta salad on the side was also really good with just the right amout of curry seasoning.  If all vegetarian food was this good, we'd see a lot more vegetarians and lot less spare tires."}
{"text":"Those who know me might need smelling salts right about now.  Yes, I ate at a vegetarian restaurant.  And I liked it very much.  The dagobah jungle was really great, though - who can argue with spicy brussels sprouts, and I had them do it up like a burro.  Tortillas really do make everything good anyway.  My dining partner had the peanut \"chicken\" which she loved, though fake meat is where I draw the line (not judging others here, I just choose to stick to eating things that really are what they're called).  I would come more often for lunch, but it took 20 minutes to get our food, so need to go when I have extra time."}
{"text":"AMAZING  This past December i visited Tempe - my first trip to Arizona in about 3 years. Why wasn't Green open when i lived there?   I'm so happy that people living in this area have yummy, delicious, affordable, exciting vegetarian/vegan options. Service was friendly, helpful, and fast. Food was delightful. I loved the rack of packaged vegan items (i.e., Dandies, Newman-O's and other hard-to-finds) available for sale.  We had two non-veg-heads in the group and they loved it.  Green is a lovely little gem."}
{"text":"Green is under new management and has aquired a totally new design since it was known as \"Veggie Fun\".  Gone is the kitchy decor - it's new, hip facelift makes it a place that you aren't afraid to bring family or friends.  A rotation of artists are now featured with their art on the walls, so there is always something new to see.  The food is generally good, but some items are a hit-or-miss.  I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef and a vegan soft-serve cone for dessert."}
{"text":"I came in and I liked the vibe in there! Nice interior and exterior their ice machine is my favorite with the rapper \"ice cube\" on it! I was debating on the the original \"g\" spicy po-boy for 6.50 or the the big WAC for 8.50 guy at register said both were really good but I thought his opinion would matter but it didn't so I literally just went with my gut, and got the poboy it was delish and enough spice for me! I'd recommend it! Drink choices are wonderful they carry box water to a lot of organic drink choices and house made drinks from green tea to a strawberry lemonade! I'm definitely coming back and trying more things. I just wish I got a side with my sandwich since it doesn't come with anything that's a selection you have to make on your own."}
{"text":"A really great restaurant, this deserves to be said first, and the best vegan/vegetarian in Tempe.  Going on my best of Tempe list.  If you are one of my anonymous followers on Yelp, you know I love meat.  When we make plans to eat at Green, I get excited because the food is great despite the fact that there is no meat.  They just make great food at Green.  I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food.  Never had one that tasted good, but it is fun trying them all.  Maybe one day I'll start worrying about my sugar intake.  And the tSoynami's are really good, but closer to a dessert than a drink.  The wings were suggested to me on my first visit, which seemed a bit daring for a vegan restaurant, but . . . they were great and I get them all the time.  I would not recommend a vegan pizza unless you know what you are getting yourself into.  My mostly vegetarian daughter lives off of cheese and mushroom pizza, but couldn't stomach the vegan verity.  Now she has the crab puffs and peanut tofu appetizers.  And my vegetarian wife gets whatever she wants and doesn't have to ask about unmentioned ingredients, which I have been told is a rare and liberating experience.  The layout of the interior provides a friendly and inviting atmosphere.  We usually try to snag the couches.  Art from aspiring artist usually decorate the walls, and the bathrooms offer really cool sinks.  Opposite the wall of art is a mural made up of re-used and re-claimed materials.  I like it and my daughter always has a few questions about it (e.g., Are those car doors real?  What is that?), which gives me a chance to point out that re-using is even better than recycling, although both have merit.  A few more visits to Green, and I'm sure my daughter will know what I'm talking about.  And our Tempe location, the original location, is better than your Phoenix location.  There, I said it.  But maybe I should try the Phoenix location first."}
{"text":"Wait, did Green open up another restaurant in Phoenix?  Like many of you, I was overjoyed to utter that wholly unexpected turn of events.  Am I in a giant garage?  There's a hangar door for a narrow, long car.  I suspect this set-up works well when it is warm, but not hot, and you want to eat outside.  Or eat on the edge of being outside, but remain inside.  You get to choose how close to being outside you want to be without actually being outside.  The way I see, Green is a great restaurant and it happens to be vegetarian/vegan.  Where Green surpasses other restaurants is flavor.  The salad, the most neglected item on every other menu-- flavorful.  Other menu items -- flavorful.  Did I mention that I like meat?  If you are answering, \"no?\", then you need to read some of my other reviews.  And feel free to endorse them as funny or cool.  The answer is yes, people.  The reason I like Green is because what I like even more is good food.  This incarnation of Green has an artsy (in a good way), trendy, causal kind of feel.  There's folksy art on the walls available for purchase, and am in a hangar for mini airplanes?  There's also the companion coffee-dessert shop next door, called Nami.  It is where you get the Tsoynami.  If you don't know what that is, maybe it's time to find out."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The food is always a 10 and they have such an incredible variety. I also appreciate the wide variety of drinks.  I brought my skeptical parents here and they went out of their comfort box a bit to try some vegan/vegetarian food and were very impressed! They have requested to go back:)"}
{"text":"Trying to eat better and a good friend told me about this place. An amazing way to ease into eating vegetarian, many of the meals have imitation meats made with vegetables."}
{"text":"So now that I've come up for air, I can write this review. I don't even know how to begin to explain just how amazing this place is. I started with the sangria which comes in a huge mason jar. Two straws you ask???  Nooooooo thank you ma'am. Then came the buffalo wings right before my enchilada fries and my husbands cheesesteak sandwich. The flavors are out of this world and I never want to go back to earth. Well played Green New American .... well played!"}
{"text":"This place is a regular pit stop for me! Almost anything you get here is good. Chili fries are a must try, also their eggless rolls are yummy! The mongolian with mock chicken, and the green burger are some of my favorites.  Oh and they have good vegan icecream!"}
{"text":"I love Green. Green makes going vegan easy. They have it all:  vegan meats, vegan cheese, vegan baked goods, and even vegan ice cream! I had an \"Egg McMuffin\" the other day and thought I was legit eating meat and eggs again. Seiten chicken and tempeh meats galore here at Green. I'm both sad and glad that I don't live closer to Green. I'm sad because they're delicious and glad because I would go broke.   It's a clean little eatery and seating dwindles fast here during lunch. Eat clean and green at Green!"}
{"text":"Wellll had I known this place existed, I might have become a vegetarian sooner!   We went here for \"late bday dinner\" for the first time. We probably looked completely out of place (probably because we didn't look like unshowered hipsters..jk!)   Anyway, I got the Singapore soy, which was zesty and delicious! I loved the crispy tofu! My friends got the big WAC burgers and the Mongolian bowl. They were both extremely satisfied with their choices.   We will definitely come back! Oh and their vimto drink is amaze balls!"}
{"text":"This place was very delicious. We decided to not order anything healthy and tried the Big Wac and animal fries and both were so good! I usually do not love vegan cheese but it tasted so good in both dishes. I am a long-time vegetarian and want to go vegan soon, so I hope to come here in the future, both to try other menu items and get some inspiration for recipes at home! It is so good."}
{"text":"Green is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It's nice to go somewhere knowing I can eat something totally vegan without sacrificing flavor.   My favorites on the menu are the buffalo wings, the spicy chicken sandwich, and definitely the big wac, but everything so far has been amazing! My vegetarian friend didn't even eat all her chicken because it reminded her too much of real chicken. I, on the other hand, love this, because I still enjoy the taste of meat and dairy. Green gives me that satisfaction without having to give up being vegan.   Come to Green is you want delicious, cheap, junky vegan food, and make sure to stop at Nami afterward for vegan ice cream!"}
{"text":"My only regret for my meal was that I came alone, because I wanted to try so many different dishes but I could only eat so much. It's so perfect for a hearty yet healthy-ish meal, AND there's free Wifi! I loved my peanut chicken bowl. I usually don't get mocked chicken at vegan restaurants, but Green's chicken was delicious. Just don't expect it to taste like chicken.  At the counter, definitely order one of the pastries (or two). I loved my peanut butter bar, which was essentially like a really creamy peanut buttery rice-crisp bar with chocolate on top. I also caved and got a soynami after my meal, but honestly, I'd skip it... I got one of their specials, the Almond Brothers (chocolate bark with almond + housemade caramel sauce + chocolate base). It definitely tasted like normal froyo, but a little too sweet and icy for me."}
{"text":"We've been coming to both Green locations for years, but recently the passed two times we've been there the manager has argued and been deeply rude to the customers. The first time was at Nami, a woman was simply confused of the pricing because I guess she was in there prior, ordered the same thing and it was less. She was very calm, and the manager was really snobby and kept bickering with her. It was really embarrassing for both the customer and the establishment. The second time we came in today, my friend tried to order the same salad she always had to find out you guys changed the menu..The pricing had gone up and now there was no chicken...no big deal, but she wanted something taken out of it. The manager brought he salad back and was just like \"can I just bring you a plate and you just pull out whatever you don't want?\" It was pretty inconsiderate and having been a manager myself for 6 years at a staple AZ restaurant, I know this was probably not the best way to approach the situation. Shouldn't you be offering your customers good food AND friendly service? I would hate for green to get pretentious."}
{"text":"Most of the food arriving to the table was room temperature when it was meant to be hot. The prices were a little bit high, for the quality."}
{"text":"We come here every now and again to indulge in a soynami. I will note, we are not vegetarian but do enjoy coming here once in awhile. For us, soynamis area great treat and they offer a variety of great tasting combinations that closely match (if not taste exactly like) their whole, non-vegetarian counterparts.   Being able to eat other options, I think they are a bit pricey for the amount you get. They used to be bigger. However, they area a great treat and if I only ate vegetarian I would literally have to come here pretty much every week to get one! haha   Keep up the great soynami love and if you've never had you - you HAVE to try it! So gooood!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for an early dinner.  Husband got the Burger. Thyme fries on side.  I got Coconut Curry Rice Bowl, all vegetables.  Everything was very delicious. Would get again.  Sat outside; it was nice.  Only negative: Hubby's burger came first, alone. My meal and his fries didn't come until he was 3/4 done eating burger. They need to work on timing.  Would definitely come back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"I got a side of vegan chili and my friend got the vegan green chili cheeseburger. Both were so delicious, we will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great for hanging out with your vegan and vegetarian friends"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. We've lived across the street for almost 7 years and this is my first visit.  Off the bat: pretty busy (granted it's a Saturday but this isn't a prime location - this is a destination concept and this location is tucked right next to the Salvation Army store). I didn't realize it was quick casual (you order like a fast food place but they bring you your meal). Great beer, wine and cider selection. Couple of fresh brewed teas in addition to a reach-in cooler full of beverages.   Menu looked pretty decent! I wanted to try so many items but I know I am not a big eater so I settled on the cheese chili fries. They were so good! I paired with a cider since they aren't always available in PHX. I'm coming back for the spicy tomato pasta number next time.  I am so excited to see they have almond milk shakes! Dairy is not my friend and ice cream pretty much kills me even though it is the most amazing thing on Earth. I'm having one of those with my daughter next time. She'll be thrilled I can have some ice cream with her.  All-in-all, a great find. Looking forward to another great visit. As I write this review, the line is out the door. That's really great to see in this neighborhood.  Ps - really read the reviews. If you are having a bad experience, speak up to someone who is running the joint; chances are it's not them, it's you."}
{"text":"I already knew I loved @greendamon/Green because they offer a safe haven for vegans (and non-vegans) that realize being vegan or vegetarian does not mean you have to eat healthy, and that every meal doesn't have to be made of vegetables.  So, there are some majorly delish dishes... the artichoke gratine, the samosas, orecciette pasta with meatballs, the secret bbq chicken sandwich... and they always have some creative special.  Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured....   and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!  So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.  An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...  BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.  So - do yourself a favor. Try Green because the food is great, they care about all living beings, they have vegan blizzards, and one day they will have the best thing you have ever eaten on their menu.  I'm going to write a letter a day until they add it to their menu. I'm serious. I can be a real pest."}
{"text":"It is an honor to be the First To Review this brand new Green location!  Just like Green Tempe, the menu provides an array of delicious vegan treats ranging from salads to flatbread pizzas to bugers, Po Boys, and bowls filled with various varieties of mock meat.  Everything at this location tastes exactly the same as the other location, however, the love exudes from every meal prepared by the incredibly friendly and eager staff.  The location is great, and is perfectly located next to Nami - where you can pick up your vegan soft tserve \"blizzards\" in any form you desire. I recommend peanut butter with double chick-o-sticks.  The actual restaurant is super clean, modern, and fresh. The front is a glass garage door that when the weather allows, will open to a patio. I cannot wait for this.   If you have not been to Green, I highly recommend you give it a try... the artichoke gratine, chili fries, yellow curry with crispy tofu, and secret BBQ sandwich are among my favorites.  And don't forget your dessert next door at Nami!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite finds in Phoenix/Scottsdale. I've had several items and have seen a lot of consistency.  Lots of flavor, easy on the greasy, and the food is filling.  I would have given 5 stars but both restaurants could do better cleaning.  Sitting at sticky & broken tables with left over food from previous guests isn't appealing.  Great place for a casual lunch to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"it's okay. i think there are cheaper and higher quality vegan foods at whole foods! if it weren't so close to the asu campus and scottsdale, it wouldn't be that busy!"}
{"text":"Good vegan food.  Just don't ask for anything special (like cheese on side of a big WAC - apparently they insist on it being melted which I don't like). Service really stinks"}
{"text":"Have loved Green for years. The staff know my husband and I by name. However, with the \"recent\" changes they have made we will no longer be able to support Green. Al a carte menu is what we feel a sneaky way of increasing prices. In addition, they took some of our favorite options on the menu away. Very sad day."}
{"text":"The best food: tasty, fresh, reasonably priced, served in a totally unpretentious setting. Great selection of dishes and drinks. The vibe is very laid back. The last time we were there a group of bikers parked their choppers in the parking lot, came in and chowed down on some real vegan treats. Very copasetic!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice people. Poor service. Waited 20 minutes past my scheduled pick up time.  Not acceptable."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here while I was visiting her from Palm Springs and wanted to try the vegan options they had here. Surprisingly there is quite a bit and this has gotta be one of my favorites of all time! The jerk salad was sooo good and I still crave it! The big wac was scarily similar to the real thing too. Id recommend both. We also tried a couple bowls and the wings (i think native foods has better wings) overall great vibes and loved it"}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Green New for about 2 years now. I'm from Los Angeles, but have a ton of friends in Arizona and discovered this place via Yelp. On every visit I made it a point to stop at Green New. I moved here in November and have only been 3 times. My 2 visits were just as I remember it! Excellent on every level. This last visit - Not so much. My husband and I went in for a Big Wac. We were about to place our order when I looked down and noticed the menu's looked different. I inquired about them, and was told they had an updated menu with new items. We decided to take a quick look and apparently they downsized....and raised the prices. The Big Wac no longer comes with a side, but is now $8.95 for just the sandwich and all sides are additional. We wanted fries and those are now $3.75. Whatever. We knew it was going to be good and we drove 35 minutes for this specific meal, so we ordered. The woman with the red hair was very nice, took our order and gave us our water cups. The thin pale woman with the short dark hair looked as if she hated her job. No smile, no warmth, she appeared to be just miserable. Totally not the friendly faces I'm used to! Really weird to see because everyone has always been super cool! I even made friends with one of the manager ladies who always recognized us and knew about our treks back and forth from Los Angeles. Anyway, out came our food, served to us by the dark haired girl. She said \"Enjoy\" and took off. Eh, no matter, cause I'm about to get down on this Big Wac! So I took a bite and it was tasty as ever! Picked up a fry and that sucker was cold and hard. The portion was a handful and they were unseasoned! WTH?! What happened to the seasoning? So I asked my husband if he wanted a dipping sauce and he asked for a side of 1000. I get up and wait at the counter...and wait...and wait...and wait. These people have just taken my order and just served me my food, but I was forced to wait in line while other patrons ordered and all I needed was a side of 1000. And it's not like they didn't see me. The girl who served me my food was looking right at me while she was just stood around. By the time I was given my sauce my food was cold and my fries were stiffer then when they were served to me! NOT COOL!!  My Big Wac was just like I remembered it - DELICIOUS. The service, however, was not. Of course I'll go back because the food is tasty. I'll just need to prepare for the bad attitudes the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre \"Vegan\" food and service.  I'm better off at Whole Foods. My original post was removed anyways after I pointed out the braless rude cashier. Lemonade was extremely sweet, bbq mocked chicken burger was super greasy and it tasted like burnt salty bbq sauce. My Sister's salad was also super greasy and bland."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I loved this joint. Great food, good portions, good beer. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Big wacs are crazy good. they're not open Sunday, but next door has good vegan breakfast. We eat here all the time, whenver friends are in town and when we're craving some delicious food in a cool environment. Big wacs!"}
{"text":"So far, I've tried the Thai Peanut Bowl, Lemon Pesto Bowl, and Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\". Every. Single. Item. Was so unbelievably tasty and satisfying!  I'm positive I could bring my meat eating friends here and they'd feel the same way. I'm a very new vegan, and the taste and feel of meat is still very memorable. Their mock meat game is totally on point, and they use quality ingredients.   I especially loved the half sized pieces of walnut in my pesto bowl. Really a nice surprise.   Take caution with the parking.  It was my first time parking here today, and I only have a not-so-green Toyota 4Runner. The parking area is tight. I almost had to park elsewhere. You'd have a serious challenge parking anything much bigger."}
{"text":"I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.  We entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.  Chili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for \"chili fries\" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't \"chili\" in any capacity that I would recognize.  In terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.  My wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with \"mum's sauce\" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.  The egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.  The atmosphere was \"hip\" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare \"WE'RE VEGAN!\" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place on many occasions and have tried a few things myself from the big wac (which is very good) to lesser popular items on the menu that are very good as well, its a small place and gets crowded at times but very well worth it try it someday you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great selection of items!!! The BBQ Sammie is beyond amazing! And there's so many tea choices."}
{"text":"This is really good food but the only issue I have is the line. I ordered to go over the phone and when I got there the line was very long. I'm on my lunch break and I have to be back on time so it's really irritating for me. When I got my food, sat down, and it wasn't even hot anymore. You guys should really look into getting more registers or at least a designated to go area. I love the food, just wish it was hot by the time I sit down to eat it..."}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this place before since my friend owns it, but I guess I haven't. I'll admit that I'm a meatetarian, so this place isn't for me - but WAIT! It is for me... this place aims to make vegan food that tastes more like what \"normal\" people are used to since most \"normal\" people can't stomach most vegan cuisine.  I'm one of these people that can't stomach it. I prefer my meat and cheese and gluten and whatever else vegans cringe at. Not everyone is cut out to be a vegan. Some vegans I know of are kinda fat - they get this way because with the restrictive diet, they end up loading up on carbs eating nothing but chips and bread and candy and bean burritos and pasta. I'm not going to argue on how healthy or unhealthy this lifestyle is, but I'll say that the food at Green isn't diet food. It's rich and flavorful and a good. It's a perfect place to go if you're a couple and only one of you is vegan.  I dated a vegan once... I'm used to normally being the picky eater, but holy shit. We couldn't eat anywhere due to her \"diet\" restrictions and it was terribly annoying. Eventually, I got her eating burgers and steaks and real food again. Before that, of the few restaurants we were allowed to eat at - this was one of my favorites.   The menu is creative and there's something for everyone (unless you're allergic to veggies and tofu). I dare say my friend is a culinary genius and I suggest you all check out That's a Wrap (his other restaurant) as well."}
{"text":"Great veggie options but a little pricey for what u get!  Wished the portions were bigger!  We did enjoy our meals there as they were truly vegan!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend checking this place out! The food was delicious. I ordered the rice bowl with \"chicken\" and orange sauce and it tasted like authentic Chinese food. The portion was bigger than I expected, but I still managed to save enough room for the famous ice cream they serve. It was so creamy and they didn't skimp on toppings like most places. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the wait. The line was literally going out of the door onto the patio and they only had one person taking orders. I waited at least 25 minutes just to get to the cash register. If you have extra time on your hands I would definitely check this neat, modern restaurant out!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy this place. The food variety is fabulous without being overwhelming. There are great healthy options mixed with mock bar food options and honestly all the options are fantastic.   I love the atmosphere. The service is always quick, friendly and fun.   I am a regular here and I highly recommend checking it out!  The Artichoke Chicken Salad is wonderful, the chili cheese nachos are good, the Kung Pao with noodles and tofu is delicious.   DO NOT skip the fresh lemonade or green tea. Honestly, it would be a big mistake! And I dare you to mix them...doooo it!"}
{"text":"My review is mostly because your service is not good. If a person orders ahead don't make them wait an hour in line while their food gets cold. They ordered ahead for a reason. My friend had my animals in the car which was her bad but it's your bad that you wouldn't let her pay. She didn't want to stiff you and leave. Do better, because this is a consistent problem. People don't call ahead so they can wait while everyone orders to purchase their food. It's why my takeout is always cold."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints... Great staff, amazingly delicious food.... Service is fast.. There is always a line here but you won't have a hard time finding a place to sit... Plus they have good wine.... I keep coming back.."}
{"text":"I honestly end up at Green every few weeks. I love the atmosphere, service and food. Whether you're vegan or not you will enjoy their food (I brought my non-vegan grandparents here for my birthday and they could not get over how amazing vegan food can taste).  The menu is great and there is something for ANY mood. Although you've GOT to try the \"crab\" puffs. Also- tsoynami. Enough said."}
{"text":"We were only in Phoenix overnight, but we ate there TWICE! because the food is so good. Wish this place was in Philly. Food was excellent, although it's a bit loud inside, outside in back was very comfortable. Only one vegetarian in our group, but we all enjoyed the food. The staff is consistently very nice, will definitely eat here again. (oh, the fries are awesome!)"}
{"text":"Delicious yummy and filling had the Big WAC!!! And it hit the spot, the flavors and consistency was perfect! Ask for medium rare!! LOL"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food! Great atmosphere! Nice people! Super affordable!  ABSOLUTELY LOVE ITTT!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Went there just now and paid 13 dollars for a big wac and little bit of fries. Though they charged me for a full side of fries. Asked one of the guys that worked there if it was normal to get this little fries after paying for a side 5 dollar side of fries... \"Uh yeah, uh I guess...\" Then walked away. Awesome customer service Green."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Super loved the eggless egg rolls. Had the blonde Alfredo full of perfect veggies. My daughter loved her chai latte and veggie burger with fries. Will definitely do this again and I'm not vegan!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Since becoming vegetarian I've missed chicken wings; Green has a tasty, vegan alternative! For an appetizer, Chili Fries are tasty too!  I've had the No Harm Chicken Parm and the \"Meatball Po-Boy; both were pretty good, but the Thai Peanut Bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes and yes, so good! Vegetarian place with so much amazing mock chicken and mock beef and all the things your heart desires! The tsunami is amazing of course my favorite thing is the lemon pesto bowl, and their fries are to die for!!"}
{"text":"First time every going to a restaurant that was Vegan and had a menu just for gluten free items. My friend is vegetarian and had been asking me to go try her favorite place with her for some nice meatless lunch. I was in heaven!!! Especially with the new year and trying to eat healthier it seemed as a good idea. I didn't necessarily get healthy of food but in comparison for fast food it was a lot better for you. I got a Big Wac...hehehe which as you can get the hint from the name it was suppose to be a Big Mac. Was much better. We also split the spicy buffalo \"wings\" which were phenomenal as well as a Pickle Wendy. A must try place for something different and yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but my girlfriend is. Out of every vegan place she has taken me to, this is easily my favorite. I got the Big Wac. It was so good that after finishing my first, I went back and got another. We also tried one of the Tsoynami, which was pretty good as well. I don't live in Arizona, so I've only been once, but if I am ever nearby I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to a vegan restaurant. I was so thrilled to come here, I couldn't contain myself. The employees were nice, but they were busy. The people in the restaurant seemed a bit snobby, but I shouldn't care about them anyway. I am there to eat, not make friends.   I was overwhelmed with choices. I went for the buffalo wings and the spicy chicken po' boy sandwich. My boyfriend got the Green Veggie Burger, and his sister got the no-harm chicken parm. We are vegan, she is not.  The wings were by far my favorite! I think I will order them as a meal or to share though. Some reviews said the portion was small, but I couldn't finish them despite how delicious they were. My sandwich was pleasantly messy and delicious. The texture is truly fabulous as far as faux meat goes. Don't come here expecting gardein textures and flavors - it is the best of the best!   A lot of people said it was greasy and oily. I am familiar with a low-fat diet and usually eat as low-fat as possible. Even though this is not health food (unless you get the healthier options), it doesn't feel heavy or disgusting like traditional SAD food does. There is a noticeable difference. The salt level could be taken down a notch, but other than that, this food is AMAZING.   After going to Vegas and trying vegan food at restaurants here, Green is still winning as far as value and quality goes. I can't wait to go back, and Green will certainly be on my mind for awhile."}
{"text":"Green is my favorite restaurant ever.  Price, quality, service, taste.  I recommend it to anyone (omnivores, vegetarians, or vegans alike) to stop by if they're anywhere near the area.  I usually have the no harm chicken parm, which is delicious.  I think I've tried about half of the sandwiches on the menu and while they are all tasty, none compare to the no harm.  From the appetizers, I've had the crab cakes, which are interesting, but I wouldn't feel compelled to order them regularly.  I've also had the artichoke dip, which i think is fantastic.  I've had a number of the soynamis as well and they are a wonderful treat.  Pick from the already creative menu or create your own.  My girlfriend went to Phoenix last month and brought back a no harm chicken parm on the plane for me.  It was the best surprise!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but can appreciate vegan cuisine so I decided to check out Green New American and was happy with my meal.  I went with the Big Wac and fries which was really good and tasty.  It's quite interesting that they are able to make those patties taste so beef like but not have any meat in them.  I'd definitely come back some time to try some of the other options on the menu.  Worthy of a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Been on a kick on cleaning up my diet and was on the search for alternatives meat products, that not only tasted good but was wallet friendly. I've heard little blips of how yummy Green's items are and found that their Secret BBQ Sammie is one of the best mock chicken sandwiches you could order!  Green is conveniently located next to Nami which serves up soy-based ice cream, pastries, desserts and coffee. However, I needed food-food and Green serves up some of that and it is all plant-based! Green also serves alcohol, if you are so interested. I ordered the Secret BBQ Sammie, a side of fries and got their House Made Strawberry Lemonade. Items are a la carte.  The space is a bit small but has a patio out front and out back. Big windows to allow bright light in. There's bar seating and tables. The staff was really friendly and informative.  The Secret BBQ Sammie has slices of thin mock chicken, slices of bell pepper and carmelized onions in a espresso bbq sauce and vegan mayo. Legit BBQ sauce, it was tangy, sweet, hint of spice and then some. The mock chicken was thin like sheets of tofu, but had a texture similar to chicken but with more bite and chew to it. I really enjoyed it, it's one of those things where you can appreciate it's similar characteristics while still being it's own thing. The bun itself held pretty well to it's filling and did a good job of soaking up all the BBQ sauce. The fries were okay, they didn't seem hot or fresh but are the typical thin cut fries. I ended up taking half of my meal home because it was really filling. The house lemonade was good, I also tried their limeade and found both to be refreshing while not being overly sweet.   For price point I'm pretty impressed, this meal with a drink came out to be around $12 which is not bad for a plant-based meal that actually tasted legit!   Parking is a bit of a pain here during lunch time and turning into Green or Nami on 7th can be a bit of a hassle during peak times. Despite the traffic, I'm excited to try the other things Green has to offer!"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot to eat, I gave it a try cause my brothers family is vegetarian and I was surprised by how good the burger I got was, I ordered the big wac $8.50, The wait wasn't to long and the food was fresh. The only down side is the food doesn't come with a side you gotta pay extra for fries or whatever side you want."}
{"text":"If you're not in a hurry, this place is probably better. I called a head to order because I didn't have much time, and I still had to wait. I loved the vegan strawberry shake, but the hummus and chips were pretty mediocre and definitely overpriced for what I got (those were the two things on the menu they could serve me quickly)."}
{"text":"Love this spot! I always call ahead because the line is usually out the door. The Brussels sprouts are a must! Love the faux chicken as well."}
{"text":"We go back here when we want to know what we're going to get... if that makes any sense. You see, it's tasty and they have a lot of options ranging from very healthy to \"junk\" food and a lot of desserts.  But despite all the choices, it never seems exciting or imaginative but rather, consistent, and kind of like a diner where all the choices are vegetarian.   And despite how it sounds, I don't mean any of this negatively... sometimes it's exactly what I'm looking for! Good!"}
{"text":"Casual and friendly! I have been here a few times, my favorite  starter is the samosa and then Carne asada sandwich.  Sangrias are very good too! Many options to chose and so far all have been very tasty. Place gets crowded worth the wait. oh ice cream specials to end and lots to choose from"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu! My husband and I both got a burger, we shared fries and buffalo chicken bites. The sauce on the burger was especially good and so was the buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"would it be too brief to simply proclaim \"best place ever!\"? ok, fine.  how about elaborating by saying order thee green salad and the kung pao bowl or some \"wings\"?  they are so good, you'll thank me later.  you dont' have to be vegan to appreciate the yummy-ness."}
{"text":"Googled a lunch spot today after visiting Desert Botanical Gardens, for something in the area and this came up highly recommended.  I am a serious carnivore, but figured what the heck.  What a pleasant surprise.   It's exciting, fresh, cool, bustling, funky and delicious.  Interesting menu with lots of choices (even if I didn't know what many of them were).  GREAT homemade lemonade, limeade, and the  best \"red\" drink that I forget the name of.  Lots of vegan options.  Good portions. VERY reasonable. Nice staff.  Hip patrons. College kids, etc.  It is an order at the counter place where you get a number and they drop the food off at your table.  Simple, quick and worth the trip.  You definitely don't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm not a vegetarian. I don't have the faintest idea how they get tofu to taste like chicken, but it's great! Great menu and nice atmosphere. Love the walls! Read the story about Fred on the wall, it will make you happy while you eat the great food!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Green last night for the first time and LOVED it.  The food is all vegan/vegetarian and it's awesome.  They have quite a few choices on the menu, much of which is made with mock chicken or beef. You can also get crispy tofu or fresh tofu in most anything too.  You order at the counter, and the staff is super friendly. We got the samosas for an appetizer.  They were pretty tasty, although a little mushy inside.  The sauce they came with was delish.   Although there are tasty looking bowls and pasta on the menu, I got the Original \"g\" po' boy and my boyfriend got the Mum's meatball po'boy.  Mine was sooo good and really spicy.  The sauce on the mock chicken was awesome and the thyme fries are delicious.  My boyfriend loved his too, and the few bites I had of his sandwich were definitely enjoyable. He got the curry pasta salad with his and really liked it.   We decided to try out a Soynami too- which is soy ice cream mixed with organic ingredients.  We chose the Newman's chocolate cookies with chocolate sauce.  Really good.   The food was great, and the best part is that it's super cheap.  Our sandwiches were only $6.50.  That's crazy! Our app was $3.50- even crazier!  I talked with one of the employees and he told me that they have plans to get a liquor license and once that happens, they will become a full service restaurant.   The decor of the place is pretty cool too.  They have artwork lining the walls, including one titled \"Penis bites man.\"  Hmm.  I really liked their lighting- it gave the place an intimate feel.   I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone and everyone- not just vegetarians."}
{"text":"Love Green.  Love Nami too.  Had breakfast there this morning.  I am vegan, my wife is not.  We both like the food at Green.  If you're really going for comfort food try the Big Wac!"}
{"text":"Eat the tsoyamis!! The soft serve ice cream is DELICIOUS! They have a lot of different flavors, but they will also serve you plain vanilla soft serve if you want some simple indulgence !  In addition to the the delicious tsoynamis, there are a lot of options to choose from on their menu - from burgers, wraps, and fries, to fresh salads and food bowls (similar to what can be found in portland)  an all-vegan restaurant in the desert of phoenix/tempe. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I love vegetarian meals, love Thai food, love flavor, so after my daughter recommended Greens and I found myself in the area, my husband, son and I stopped in. My son loved his veggie burger, my husband got something which was supposed to be spicy  veggies and rice noodles, while I got curry/ coconut veggies, rice noodles and mock chicken. My husband and I were only able to tell which bowl was which by the mock chicken in mine. There was absolutely no difference in the flavor between the 2 bowls. I told the waitress that there was no flavor in either, and she just shrugged and said \"it depends on who's cooking on how it tastes.\" I told her that mine had NO  flavor, that if I closed my eyes and had a spoonful, I couldn't tell if I was eating a piece of broccoli or the mock chicken, and there was not even a hint of coconut or curry. She just said \"sorry about that\" and walked off. For $10 a bowl, it was definitely a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for over a few decades, I tend to seek out vegan and vegetarian restaurants in every city that I go to. Without a doubt I have always had a positive experience at Green. The staff is always courteous, the facilities are clean, I have not waited long for food, what I order is typically delicious, and the price is very reasonable for the quality that you're getting. I have eaten at both locations, and even had an art show at one a few years back. The individuals running the establishments are professional, socially conscious, and in touch with their community. It would be very hard-pressed to find this anywhere else."}
{"text":"The entire time I was eating the big wac, all I could think of was \"I can't believe this isn't beef.\"  It was bigger and tastier than a Big Mac. Although there was a bite where the meat wasn't mixed well and I got a mouthful of black pepper. The coleslaw was okay. I will definitely try their other dishes if I have enough time!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience, coming from Los Angeles I was not expecting much vegan fare at all in Phoenix, much less a fully vegan restaurant. Not only are they full vegan, they have a good selection and my husband and I both enjoyed the food.  The puffs were good and the bowls as well. Yum!  A bit too expensive for this to become a regular go to, but if I'm dying to be around some legit vegan food this will be my first stop."}
{"text":"Yum! We had already eaten at their other location and loved it. We were close to this location and stopped in for a quick bite.   Friendly service and we got our food quickly. I ordered the Argentine Po Boy to reminisce on our recent trip to the South and enjoyed every bite. Delicious and messy!  Great beer options too. I'd love to check this place out for brunch sometime."}
{"text":"Great healthy affordable vegan options! The hummus was delicious!! Love the bowls and the teas :) cute place located in phx.  Has a hipster casual feel to the place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough!  We were here 10 days and ate here 8 different times!  We went to both locations as well.  Would love to have something like this in Lehigh Valley Pa. Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First, as many other reviewers here, I am not a vegan or vegetarian. With that out there, today I had lunch at Green with some coworkers and I was really looking forward to the experience. Time was short so we did pick up and I ordered chili with a side of tahini coleslaw. $8. Eight bucks for 2 tiny little side containers (see pictures ... taken before a spoon or fork ever touched the food ... They did not even FILL the little cup of freakin chili) most other restaurants would use these for sides of dressing . I actually thought they were joking when they brought it out. The taste is okay .... Nothing fancy nor exceptional .... The chili was pretty salty ... And cold....and when I ordered the tahini slaw I assumed it would be garlicky and creamy but this is pasty and tastes vaguely of peanut butter. If I had half a brain I would have asked for my money back but I think I was still in sticker shock. The place was overly warm and dingy so I was glad to miss that dining experience. However My coworkers ordered the ice cream and were very impressed. Maybe I will return for a sweet treat but never ever for a meal. My $8 bucks would have gone much further elsewhere. It's crazy to be just as hungry when you've finished eating as when you started. Total waste of funds. For my own experience, 1 star .... The extra one is for the ice cream because everyone seemed to really enjoy it .... Especially our lactose intolerant ladies!"}
{"text":"I am such a meat eater so this means a lot that I am giving a vegetarian restaurant 5 stars... Or a review at all!! But wow bravo to Green for creating a vibrant menu with a large range of dishes that actually interest people other than just vegetarians!! I've gotten the Big Wac two times already because it literally tastes exactly like a Big Mac... Like you ACTUALLY feel full afterwards it's crazy!! Helped me nurse a wild hangover! The environment is so welcoming and aesthetically pleasing :) only criticism is that it's a tad bit too nippy inside! I will be a returning customer, see you soon Green!"}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian/vegan, nor do I live in Arizona, but I get Green every time I visit (and sometimes more than once in a visit)!  The Big Wac is the star for me.  Tastes just like a Big Mac (probably better!), and you wouldn't know you weren't eating meat if it wasn't advertised.  The fries are delicious, too.  I wasn't sure how to feel about the Tsoynami (like a McFlurry with soy ice cream), but that was delicious, too.  The staff has always been friendly.  The prices can be a bit high, but not bad considering how full I feel every time I eat there.  And I don't go because it's healthy, I go because it's delicious, so that doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have vegan alternatives and not be stuck ordering side salads everywhere. Just by having a place like this earns them the extra star from 3 to 4.  My friend ordered the sweet & sour tofu and said it was OK. Since we were hitting a bunch of restaurants this night, I didn't have a main course, but I DID get the \"tsoynami\".   Speaking to the tsoynamis, they are delicious. Soy based ice-cream blizzard treats. I didn't realize how much I had missed milkshakes since going pescatarian, and this tasted like it came from Dairy Queen (I got the cookies-n-cream tsoynami). All the yummy goodness of a blizzard w/o any of the stomach aches, health issues, or moral issues (or whatever reason you've given up dairy).   The rest of the menu looks innovative and tasty and I wish we had more time in Scottsdale to try more items.   If you were to compare this to a non-vegan place, I don't know if it would rank as high. But, for what it is, this place seems to have found a niche and is doing it well.  **things to note** This place is almost impossible to find. It is tucked away in a corner in a non-descript strip-mall (by a car dealership if I remember correctly). If I didn't have GPS, I would have given up on trying to find it. Also, the employees are all kinda dirty looking - expect hippy-types with dreadlocks and piercings and stretched earlobes. While I respect everyone's personal choices, I also appreciate hygiene in the people who are preparing my food... just sayin'...."}
{"text":"Really good had to look at it a few times to make sure it wasn't REALLY meat! We ordered the \"crab puffs\"...peanut \"chicken\" burrito and buffalo \"wings\"...all in all everything was yummy...the buffalo wings however hands down the best!"}
{"text":"Are you in Phoenix and looking for decent vegetarian food?  If so, Green is a good spot to try.   They had an interesting variety of sandwiches and stir fry with tofu or fake meat toppings.  It seems like they are more on the \"fake meat\" instead of \"eat something else\" side.  Personally, I'd prefer to stay away from meat substitutes so I got my dish with tofu.  I had the Thai peanut with the tofu (fried not soft).  It was a nice serving of vegetables with a strong peanut sauce with a bit of spice.  Not that much spice so unless you can't take anything, you will be able to eat it.  There are a large numbers of tables and chairs and a more limited number of booths.  If you go around dinner time it will be fairly full or busy.  Not so bad if you don't mind popping in for some quick food."}
{"text":"I too am in love with this place. Its delicious, vegan, funky, friendly....I am one of those non-meat eaters who misses meat, and this is the perfect place for me to indulge in all of the delicious things I didn't think I could eat anymore (and which just don't come out the same at home). I have had the chicken and pickle sandwich (AMAZING) and the Big Wac (FABULOUS) , and amazing fries, tahini slaw, amazing lemonade bar, and lot of other things that were all wonderful. I'm so glad Green is here!"}
{"text":"delicious vegan food! i always have to eat at green every time i am in phoenix. this time i had thee argentine po boy. it was great! the staff is always so friendly here, too."}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure what to expect of this place. I didn't read too much up on it before visiting, but I'm happy that I did. They have a large selection of \"mock\" meats w/ dishes vegetarians normally don't get to have. I had the Singapore orange rice bowl. It was a blend of broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and mock veggie chicken (you can choose from tofu, beef, or chicken). Flavor was good, my only complaint however was the absurd amount of sauce. The veggie:rice:sauce ratio was too much for me. I know for next time, I'll be asking for my rice on the side. My girlfriend had the spicy po-boy. I honestly had no idea what a po-boy was prior to this experience. I managed to get a few bites - it was pretty darn good - but also, too sauced out for our liking. We couldn't taste the rest of the goodness in the sandwich - just buffalo sauce.   There's enough stuff on the menu for me to come back and see what i like and don't like. the price is also right - they give ample portions for more than fair prices. They also make gluten free very accessible. Makes it easier to put on my list of restaurants that I'm allowed to frequent.   Looking around, they also serve alcoholic beverages. Can't complain about that either. There was a large amount of sitting space. It didn't look as big as it did from the outside. Nice patio as well! This place is definitely worth a try if you're vegetarian or not!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Was a long line but moves pretty fast. The food was very reasonably priced, and the mock chicken was delicious! Loved the dragon rice bowl with mock chicken. The fried Brussels sprouts were great too."}
{"text":"This is the best vegan food I've ever had! I'm from California, but make sure to eat here every time I'm in the area. I usually order one of their mock chicken sandwiches, which doesn't have that aftertaste some mock chicken has. The bf usually gets the big WAC, which is also amazing! Make sure to save room for a tSoynami after!"}
{"text":"New to vegan eating, my tastebuds, firmly rooted in meat eating, were happy little campers. Staff is knowledgable and helped us figure out what was a good fit for each of us. Tea is great, teen had mac and chees, ditto, hubby had curry and I had blond Alfredo bowl. We all ate 'til full and have enough for lunch tomorrow! All was good!"}
{"text":"Had the Big Wac and it was excellent. If you didn't tell me it wasn't meat I wouldn't have known better. Prices are reasonable. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"A vegan Mecca in the Arizona desert. Whether you are a plant based connoisseur or a carnivore you will love this place. I recommend the 'Big Wac', root beer float, buffalo chicken, crab puffs.... wait a minute - I recommend everything. Go wild, be naughty and try something new."}
{"text":"Walked in after 5 minutes of trying to find parking and dealing with traffic.  My 4 year old son had a yogurt with him and left it on the table. The lady that was cleaning the tables got it and almost threw it out before my husband walked up to her to let her know it was ours. She looked at my husband and handed it to him as if she was disgusted with it and said \"If it's not vegan it's not allowed in here\". Really?!   We just walked out.  Horrible!  So if someone walks in with leather shoes or a purse they'll also be kicked out or is it just food. Kind of a double standard there if you ask me."}
{"text":"Ugh I wish they could be next door to me and make me food everyday. Luckily both my jobs are close to their locations so I guess I shouldn't complain. But anyway, I love love love this place. I guarantee I will try every single thing on their menu but my favorites so far are their wings, the artichoke gratine and the drunken Mongolian. I'm not vegan but they would definitely make it easy for me to be. I will be returning for more, without a doubt."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb, and I love me some beef!! This time \"Challenge Accepted\" while visiting Phoenix! I got myself a Big Wac and washed it down w Mexican Coke!! Best Vegetarian Burger ever!! Better then San Diego (Home Town)! If I had the Big Wac in Sunny SD there be no more In N Out for me. Lol :) But I dont, so I have to settle for Beef Burgers. :(  Excellent Service at this place too!! Get the Big Wac next time you passing by!!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever ordered here is AMAZING!! I even turned my 'meat & potato's' husband onto this place who had lunch with me here  'just to please me'. He now eats his lunch here EVERY Wednesday like clockwork! We are both addicted! I adore the thai peanut bowl and hubby loves the mexicali burger. The garlic hummus is also YUMMY as is the No Harm Chicken Parm!! My only gripe is that they dont have a 2nd location in North Scottsdale!! (hint-hint!!)"}
{"text":"We tried and the Big Wack with fries   I've never tried a Big Mac from McDonalds before, but my husband said it was very similar. If you like a vegan burger that's meaty tasting, you'll love it. So so good! Must try if you're in the area!"}

{"text":"I'm a meat eater and I would go vegetarian if I could eat Green for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their soy-nami desserts are also amazing and have been known to turn any frown upside down."}
{"text":"As always friendly staff and great food. Went with the Singapore  orange and a twisle/mixed berry soynomi.  Nice Az winter day. What's not to enjoy. Pay them a visit."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Green location - I love the Tempe location but decided to try something different yesterday.  Green is located next to Nami in what looks like a tiny vegan complex. I love how cute and cozy Green was! The ice cube machine made me laugh too. Service was friendly, food was good as always. I was happy that they had the same menu as the Tempe location so I was able to get my usual - the calexico burger with thyme fries and buffalo \"wings.\" Yum!   I'll be back to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome.  The best vegetarian place in town. Their food is delicious and they bring it out really fast.  I'm def coming back on my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"On those days I wake up feeling like a hippie.. I come here. No offense to the regulars, but it is without a doubt the center for hippies and hipsters of Scottsdale. Attire: Unique?   Now do not be put off by their food selection. Yes it is all Fake Meat. Yes it is all vegan. No it does not taste like cardboard. Yes you will love this and feel bad about liking meat and go into a moral dilemma. Don't worry grab a vegan cookie and you will feel even better/worse. Just Kidding.  I have enjoyed every single thing I have had on their menu.. and their desserts are really good. I always question if the meat is real or not.. because it is super tasty.. and the flavors just pop in all of their bowls."}
{"text":"Good place, my veggie friends love it. The only thing I'd have to complain about is that the \"chicken\" tastes pretty fake. The Buffalo \"wings\" are amazing though, its just that the chicken tastes weird in the salad. Fair prices, good flavor and the soy ice cream is good"}
{"text":"Earthy, mellow, and a great place to spend many study hours in!   It's one of the few places where you can look around to see health conscious individuals. Everything from the string of white lights to earth toned chairs, tables, and even biodegradable spoons is refreshing! One of the best things here besides the food is the tea/lemonade/sweet-lime drinks. It's also free refill!   Back to the food -- The mock chicken was pretty good, I could eat this in place of real chicken any day! I couldn't even tell it was mock chicken. The No-Harm-Chicken-Parm Sandwich was so tasty and big enough to share between two. The Thai Peanut Bowl was just right, not to heavy, not to light. It's healthy, very flavorful, filling, and you can tell you're getting all the right nutrients!   Desert was one of the best parts of our meal. Forget Ben&Jerry's, now I'm always going to be craving the Coffee Co Loco Ice Cream . One thing that's very surprising about is that they place soy ice cream in the mix with coffee grinds. I know, coffee grinds? The coffee grinds are neither dry or bitter, its almost like they're mini vanilla beans or even sprinkles of chocolate. They also place chocolate and coco puffs. What I wonder is how do the coco puffs never get soggy? They're in the bottom of the ice cream and they're still crunchy.   Overall, I'm a definite fan of Green -- Makes me think if I could turn Vegan.  Con: For optimal studying purposes, I wish they had just a tad more light (Day light bulbs)"}
{"text":"Went here last night and I'm still thinking about my meal!  Hands down best vegan place I've ever been too! Can't wait to come back when I'm in Tempe.  I'm from NY and haven't found anyplace that comes close to this place! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I love this place let's just start there shall we? I'm so glad I found Green New shortly after moving to AZ because it is certainly full of options. We started with the buffalo wings, not my fave (it's a texture thing) but my gf loved it. The samosas were a bit greasy for my liking but the Big Wac made up for that! Man, that is a good sandwich. Back in the day when I ate meat and loved Mcdonalds that was my jam and now here we are in veggie land just as dee-lish! I come here just for this sandwich. Staff is always helpful and friendly and I love going next door for vegan desserts after. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is an amazing vegan restaurant! The menu is so creative (a Big Whak, with special sauce)! Can't wait to go back yet I hope the staff realizes what customer service is. I felt I was doing them a favor for being there. Also, we were there for almost 20 minutes and the staff didn't bother wiping down a spill at a nearby empty table the entire time. Granted, the place was busy yet I think wiping a spill doesn't require hours of time."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food. And it's all vegan! They have a good selection of beers and ciders. And it isn't s bad price for everything.  The chili cheese fries are my favorite, and the chicken sandwich. Good food, good atmosphere, and they have an outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The vegan chili fries and Po Boy sandwich are my go to here. They have a good beer selection and the sangria is amazing too. All the salads are really awesome too. Vegan comfort food at its finest."}
{"text":"I really like this place, especially when I am in the mood for vegan comfort food! And that's just what it is, comfort food! Don't expect to find anything adequately healthy here.  On my most recent visit, I got the brussel sprout bowl wrapped up as a burrito. It had crunchy tortilla strips and a southern sauce, and the brussel sprouts were sautéed to perfection! So yummy!  Their homemade drinks and teas are also quite delicious! I got a mix of the green tea and their fresh strawberry lemonade.  Overall, the meal was super good and the employees are generally friendly and helpful. It is a bit on the pricier side but there are only a handful of vegan restaurants that are this good, so it's understandable. If you enjoy vegan food and need a good cheat meal, this is the place! Then stop over at Nami for dessert ;)"}
{"text":"Best burger I have EVER had. Newly vegan and have had many real burgers before. This was amazing. Literally the best burger I've EVER had (the big WAC). I also got to try my friends \"hot wings\" it was amazing as well. Highly recommend this for anyone. If you are a new vegan, this will give you the hope you need. If you don't believe that a meatless diet will taste good, you have to try this place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Background: we've been coming to green for over 5 years and have patronized both their locations and talked them up with our friends and family.  The Good: these guys still make the best non-meat meat in the business (IMO).  The not-so-good: the last 3 or 4 times we've come here things seem too be deteriorating in terms of food and service.   Today we ordered fries, the BFF sandwich and the Street Taco special.  We waited almost 30 min (the guy before us had 2 beers waiting for his order!) when it arrived, the fries and my sandwich were barely warm.  WTH!   Hope they get their act together and don't simply rest on their laurels because I want to support them by they need to earn that support."}
{"text":"This place is a go-to spot for me up to 3 times a week.  The food is fantastic for vegans and carnivores alike.  I have yet to try something here that isn't delicious.  I wish they had a location in Mesa.  Six stars!"}
{"text":"So many options!! From a full menu of delicious vegan meal options to the vegan cookie dough, \"shakes and soft serve\". And if you're still undecided...they also have a great beverage choice including beer, wine, and margaritas.  The staff is great, the food comes out hot, and the atmosphere is relaxed.  I'm happy I found Green, but I'm more happy to share with you. Stop in and enjoy."}
{"text":"The have amazing food, vegeterian or vegans dream. Their mock chicken wings are delish! Definately will be there as much as possible."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Tsoynamis are the best vegan ice cream I've ever had. Everything here is vegan and delicious. The big wax and 'buffalo' wings are super popular. Cole slaw and fries are both delicious too. I just wish they were open on Sundays!!"}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE. Destroy cravings with the like minded earth friendly ninjas of this kitchen. 5 shuriken every time. Never been let down, turned away or sour faced with my meal."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of vegan and vegetarian restaurants throughout the United States this is by far the best vegan restaurant I have ever ate at in my whole entire. life I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"After all of the glowing reviews I read about this place I figured it would be the end all to good veggie/vegan food here in the valley!  Either my expectations were too high or Green just doesn't suit me...    The location is a lttle hidden but after driving up and down Scottsdale Road only twice we located it at the end of the strip mall.    Walking in the word that came to mind was \"kitschy.\"  Cute, creative and not over the top.  Smelled good!  Staff was OK... We were both hesitant with the menu since neither of us had previously been there before and the girl behind the counter seemed to be a little impatient... certainly not rude but just not overly helpful.  I had the buffalo \"chicken\" po boy and the tyme fries.  It was OK... nothing fabulous.  Very messy... (who puts halfed cherry tomatoes on a sandwich???? they're just gonna pop out when you eat it!)  Apparently the cook had no time to add the tyme on the fries or salt for that matter... they were crispy and hot though so that's a plus.    My friend had the mexicali burger and coleslaw.  The burger had good flavor but way mushy and it was just the patty, sauce and bread... could definitely been improved by some lettuce to add a little crunch.  The slaw was bland... but once she added a little siracha to it was much better!     We did share a oatmeal cookie sandwhich which was very yummy.  I am curious about some of the other menu items so I will try it again.... just won't rush out to do it..."}
{"text":"The Big Wac was the best version of Big Mac I've tasted! The BFF, Wendy's Pickle, and Animal Fries were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Only been here once due to it not being very close to my house, but will definitely make the trip again! Went with a few people so I had the pleasure of trying many of the dishes, and it did not dissapont! I only wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I just moved to chicago and wish on just about every star I see that Green will relocate here with me.    This place is amazing.  I've eaten at SO many vegetarian/vegan places all around the world and this is by far one of the BEST. The prices and service are awesome as well.    Food recommendations are:  classic pizza with just about any topping, pesto pizza is good but too rich for my tastes.  The wings, crab puffs, and chili fries are out of this world good.  Original G spicy po-boy [think buffalo chicken sandwich] and the argentine [think philly cheesesteak] are pretty much unmatched.  Order off menu the BBQ chicken sandwich!  Its AMAZING.   Jerk tofu salad ooooh how I miss you. And they make their own organic vegan soft serve?  AND they make them into tsoynamis [think DQ blizzard]?!  Yeah.  This place owns.  Basically, if you are lucky enough to be vegetarian in phx [hah] at least you have one great thing on every other vegetarian in more veg friendly cities.   Even my non-veg family and friends want to eat here over just about anywhere else in the valley as well.  Take that applebeees!"}
{"text":"Ew. As a vegan I'm into new and creative ways to make real food (aka vegetables, fruit, grains, etc) taste good. Not into weird fake meat with questionable texture. I literally felt sick when we left. I cannot believe all these reviews, I was super disappointed."}
{"text":"I never once thought that one of the best burgers I've ever had would come from a vegan resturant, but it does. I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I've been to Green numerous times and while I've enjoyed many things on their menu, I keep going back for their \"Big Wac\", their version of the Big Mac, or \"BBBQ Burger\", their BBQ bacon burger. They're delicious! The texture and flavor is exactly that of the meat version of the items they represent. They have everything from healthy options that you would expect from a vegan resturant, to bar food style options like mock buffalo wings and chili cheese nachos. There really is nothing negative to say about this place. I can't even think of an \"it might be better if...\". This is definitely a must try! Make sure to hit up Nami right next door for coffee and dessert when you're done!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We just stumbled upon it and it was wonderful.  The food was really good and the staff helped us figure out what was going on.  We're vegetarians but it was like, huh?  So yummy.  Also weirdly the cleanest bathroom I have ever been in in my life, ever.  I'd come back to Phoenix to eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Best fries probably ever.   and desert is a must. imagine a mix of vegan icecream with cocopuffs but magically the coco puffs do not become soggy..  Don't get the pizza. yu-ck."}
{"text":"I had the coconut curry. Although it was tasty I just didn't get the coconut. Where was it? I wanted chunks of fresh coconut. Still. Very good. Casual atmosphere. Too many soy dishes. For those of us who stay away from soy meat alternatives are just not here."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really cute and clean. Everyone was respectful and unique in their own special way. The animal fries were to die for and since I am not a vegan it was a good way to introduce yourself to vegan food. Out of the four dishes I was presented with I would say that I liked the wings the most. They were crunchy and the sauce was made to perfection. The BFF was very filling, it's more of a one and done sandwich due to the thick bread and the friend mock chicken. I will definitely be back here to enjoy the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"THIS is how you do vegan and gluten-free food RIGHT. Many options to choose from from the gluten-free menu. The employee who was helping me suggested some of her favorites, and when I said that I was in the mood for one of the sandwiches, she highly recommended the Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy with their gluten-free bun and suggested the sweet potato puffs as the side.  I'm SO GLAD I went with those suggestions because holy moly, both the sandwich and the sweet potato puffs were absolutely delicious! The Po-Boy had gluten-free mock \"chicken\" that was very tender and not chewy, smothered in a delicious moderately spicy Buffalo sauce and a little bit of vegan mayonnaise.  And then those sweet potato puffs! Think sweet potato tater tots but fluffier on the inside, and the outside had a nice, thin, crispy crust. A perfect combination of textures. Each one was like a little nugget of heaven in my mouth.  I just wish my stay in Phoenix was longer so that I could have come back and tried one of their many other yummy-sounding gluten-free options, especially the other sandwiches on their menu! But I guess I'll just have to come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once (but a handful of times to the Tempe location), and it has a far more casual, almost fast-food vibe to it, even though the menu and service is essentially the same. The interior decor and seating arrangement just made it seem more of a rushed dining setting than the Tempe one. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but just something I noticed right upon walking in.  I got the Secret BBQ Sammie, which was one of the two sandwiches that could be made gluten-free (the other being the Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy), and even though I could have gotten it with their gluten-free bun, I was in the mood for more vegetables, so I asked for it without any bread and just on a bed of salad greens. WOW IT WAS GOOD. And the espresso BBQ sauce they used on the mock \"chicken\" and the onions and peppers? I wanted to lick my plate clean until every drop of the sauce was in my belly (but I maintained some dignity and didn't).  Also unlike the Tempe location, I'm not sure if there is a dish return station, and if patrons are just expected to leave their dishes and utensils on the table when they're done. Because I ended up feeling awkward trying to bring my plate and fork back and not finding any place for dirty dishes. But this meant a lot of the tables weren't bused right away, so finding a clean table to sit at outside was impossible until an employee came to clean the tables.  But otherwise, a good place to get a hearty vegan (and gluten-free if you desire) meal in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Had a great veggie and noodle bowl! The milkshakes are on the sweet side, but really good too! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a vegan restaurant. We were starving and needed a quick snack to hold us over; we saw all the great reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. We ordered the hummus and chili fries. Both were very good and I'm a little embarrassed to say we scarfed it all down in a matter of minutes! The hummus was really flavorful, with hints of poblano pepper and LOADS of garlic. Don't eat the hummus unless you're not planning on speaking to anyone the rest of the day. After we ate, my sister said she thought she could kill a vampire with her breath because it was so garlicky. I really enjoyed it in the moment I was eating, but desperately needed a few breath mints afterwards. The chili fries were also very good. Not sure what they used in place of the \"meat\" in the chili, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegetarian/vegan spot in the valley. I recommend this spot to anyone who says vegan food is \"boring\". The place itself is on the smaller side but there's still plenty of seating to hold 25+ people. The parking isn't the greatest and can be rather annoying when it's busy. With that being said the food is great.   They offer a \"big wac\" which is a vegan twist on the classic Big Mac burger and it's greatly done.   The buffalo wings are a real winner and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't order them at least once.   I've tried a variety of their \"burritos\" and have yet to be disappointed. The peanut chicken burrito is my favorite. The mock meat they offer makes it very hard to even realize you're not eating the real thing. This is a great place to introduce someone to vegan food for the first time.   Be sure to order a drink and try they're house made drinks! All of them are delicious and compliment the food well.   If you still have room after the meal right next door is a vegan bakery!"}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband I were visiting Scottsdale for a couple of days and decided to eat here twice because we liked it so much the first time. I am a vegetarian and he mostly eats vegetarian. During our first visit, I had the Calexico burger with thyme fries and my husband had the Big Wac with thyme fries. The second time we had the Kung Pao Bowl with brown rice/vegan chicken and the Peanut Sauce Bowl. Although this places gets crowded, it can be hard to find a table at times, and the prices aren't the best, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Great place, some of the friendliest folks around, a wide variety of reasonably-priced choices, and some awesome presentations make for a wonderful place to congregate with your vegan / vegetarian friends... that is... if you guys can carpool as their parking lot is tiny. Who needs meat when there are places like this that use color, spices, flavorings, and lots of pizzazz to make their food stand out?"}
{"text":"The fact that this place has a separate glutenfree menu and the person on the phone when I called to ask about it seemed knowledgable (while still offering the same tired old \"don't sue us\" disclaimer of \"it's a shared kitchen and we can't guarantee there won't be cross contamination,\" I was optimistic and hopeful. They warned me about fried items in a shared frier (fries and sweet potato tots), but anything on the gf menu would be fine.   The cashier in person didn't seem to care that I stressed two members of our party need to be glutenfree. I should have taken this as a sign. Ordered buffalo wings and artichoke dip for appetizers, and they were so delicious, I was so happy, and thought things would be okay.   Then my jerk tofu salad comes out and the tofu looks suspiciously deep fried. I get up to ask, and sure enough, they deep fried my glutenfree tofu. I said I can't eat it, because I have celiac disease. She asked if they could just remove the cc'd tofu off the top and offered raw tofu in its place. No, that's not how celiac disease works. You have to remake it.   Since she was so ill informed, I decided to ask about the wings and dip. Turns out the wings and corn chips are also fried in dirty oil... Even though they were on the gf menu. When I pointed that out, she said \"well we SAY we can't guarantee there's no cross contamination.\" ...that's different than knowingly bathing all the gluten free menu items in gluten, lady. (The menu didn't state that these items were deep fried, and I figured the corn chips were store bought, so I didn't ask. Stupid me for assuming they had a clue. That shiny fancy gluten free menu was just so distractingly beautiful....)  She tried to make me pay for the remade salad, but after I said I didn't want to pay since I'd just bought a ton of food that 2/3 of our party couldn't eat even though it was on the gf menu, she comped the salad. I should have just walked out then and there, but didn't want to ruin my companion's meals. My spouse eats glutenfree so he doesn't make me sick, so any minimal contamination wouldn't harm him, thankfully.   I'm angry that their employees are so ill informed, but I'm absolutely disgusted and infuriated that the owner(s) went to the trouble of printing gf menus and pretending like they can cater to gf customers while not actually caring about the ramifications of their dishonesty and ignorance.   If you're a gluten free fad dieter, you'll have fun here pretending like you're being glutenfree because you're doing it to be trendy. But if you have celiac disease or gluten intolerance, don't bother giving these people your money.  I don't expect perfection when I eat out as a person with celiac disease. But I do expect honesty and an honest effort to minimize contamination. Neither happened, and now I am incredibly sick. Shame on you, Green. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! My vegan family and I are on vacation in Phoenix and were absolutely thrilled to find this spot. Every single thing we ordered was incredible. I had the Chicago Cheesesteak (which was SO tasty but admittedly a bit spicier than I'm used to!), my dad got the BFF Chicken sandwich, my mom got the Peanut Chicken Salad, and my brother got the brussel sprouts wrap. Also, their soft serve definitely curbed the sweet tooth after dinner. Would totally recommend to vegans and non-vegans alike."}
{"text":"So the wifesky said we should eat something healthy today and wanted to give this place a try. Well, if the little lady wants to try this place out, that's what we'll do!

A word of caution, if you use Google Maps (like I did) to search for this place, it'll show you a location on Scottsdale road (2240 N Scottsdale Rd #8 Tempe, AZ 85281) which obviously isn't the location for this restaurant as listed by Yelp (2022 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85004).  I'm not sure if they're both affiliated or not. When you're driving on N 7th St. and you don't know what you're looking for, it's easy to miss the restaurant. The signage is large but it's decorative with decorative writing so drove past it.  The entrance too can be easy to miss as it's a bit small and the signage to enter was just as small. The parking is very limited and also....small, so if you've got a monster truck or SUV, you might have difficulty parking in the back.  Parking is also shared with their sister restaurant called Nami located next door that apparently serves vegetarian pastries.  We were lucky to snag a parking spot however, if the parking lot was full, then I'm not sure where else we would've been able to park. (-1) The outside had the usual seating for dinning but was small in size and close to the busy road. The interior was also on the small side. At first we didn't know if we had to be seated first and wait to be waited on, but after seeing a line forming by the cashier, we promptly joined it.  Apparently what you do is grab a menu, join the line, and while you're waiting to get to the front of the line, you choose your items to order.  Then you pay, you're given a number which you place at the edge of your table of your choosing wherever you wish to sit providing there's seating. I'm guessing if the place was packed, I'm not sure where we would've sat.  Perhaps we would've ordered to go.  Menus - the menu was self-explanatory.  The cashier who took our orders answered any questions we had about the food and the drinks.  Service - once staff brings out your food, we didn't see them again checking in on us.  Seems like they're there to either bring out the food and clean the tables/area.  Food - I had the big Wac -- 2 hand packed vegan burgers, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame bun and the thyme fries (you can choose fruit or a tahini salad). The thyme fries didn't taste different than regular fries which I guess is a good thing but it was certainly crunchy, fresh, hot, and very tasty.  It certainly wasn't oily and greasy like regular fries was. The vegan burger also didn't taste like a vegan burger and in fact, I thought I was going to be biting into a piece of cardboard.  While it wasn't meat from ground beef, it was certainly very tasty and didn't lack any flavors as I thought it would.  In fact, the special sauce, cheese, pickles, and onions only served to enhance the flavor of the veggie burger patties itself and brought out the taste even more.  Even the sesame bun was soft and fresh as if it was just baked.   I think the various vegan items on the menu is enough to bring me back however I'm a bit leery of how small the establishment and their parking is."}
{"text":"What a delight to find a place like this in Phoenix. Really amazing vegan food, I will surely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good healthy restaurants.  I'll be coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's the perfect place to bring vegetarians and meat eaters.  The tofu is cooke perfectly, they sell gelatin free jello, and the fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Kinda tucked away in a corner, But thanks to yelp I found this place. Only in town for a week on business and will probably eat this place everyday I can and try all of this goodness. Amazing food and great service. Must try."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Green in a really long time, well over a year if not longer. A few years ago I was a regular & came on a weekly basis but then my lifestyle diet became more strict when I eliminated the \"comfort food\" that I craved, dropped sugar, & increased my workouts. I decided to go today b/c I've been sick w/ the flu & this is my third week not being active so I guess my body needed that \"comfort food\" satisfaction. I went to Green and had a salad, & for that comfort food cravings, I had the crab puffs. The salad was good & so were the crab puffs, of course the post meal feeling has me feeling tiered, which I am not used to but the food definitely hit the spot for the time being since I've been having that naughty food craving. Although I don't plan to return for a long time, maybe when that craving hits again, I still want to give Green 5 stars for being vegan, using organic ingredients whenever possible, & my salad seemed like a quality salad, so why not. It's great that Green is able to introduce vegan foods to non-vegans whose mind may not have been open to trying vegan food, that alone deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Green is absolutely delicious. I first ate here a couple of years ago and I still cannot get enough of this place. I love the eggless rolls, I love the greenza, I love the crab puffs, I love the thyme fries and I absolutely adore the tsoynami. I wish there were more restaurants as delicious and as vegan as is this one."}
{"text":"The best vegan food in Arizona! Nami is great too! I go there all the time. I would give them more than 5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Love that there is a vegan place in Tempe! It is pretty simple decoration inside, but they do have a good selection of food. They have bowls and burgers and some sides like fries. We had the coconut curry  bowl and the Chinese ginger flavored one. I like the curry one, curry taste was mild. And someone was very hungry and got another \"Big Mac\", it was too salty. The bun looks sad, but tasted good. And they do have some beer and wine selection. When bf asked the counter boy for recommendation what's good. He mumbled and then he said he doesn't drink. Bf said that he hadn't been drinking for a long time. The boy said 'why start now?' Wow!! That clicked! Bf realized that he shouldn't drink under his condition now, and decided to keep record clean. Thank you so much for helping save him from falling!"}
{"text":"Recently came in for a small meal to conduct a class project. I came in with no expectations (since I am not vegan) and had my stereotypical doubts. OMG was I totally wrong. Green is absolutely delicious!! I tried their Chili Cheese Fries and you would never even guess they're vegan! My friend got their Boneless Buffalo Wings and they were great! I would totally come back. Service was extremely fast and the ambience was super chill.  Only knock I have is the limited parking and the confusing line/waiting area. Also, the menu is not on the wall, but physical handouts you have to look at in line. I wish instead of alcohol they had some food items on the chalkboard. Consumer Behavior theories would back my ideas ;)   Either way this is such a great place for a great price!! Love that they also have the Nami across the way for dessert. :)"}
{"text":"My cousin and her friend came into town and we were looking for a place to have a quick lunch. Her friend came across this place on yelp & wanted to try it out. They both are vegetarians and I am a meat lover but I'm always down for trying new places and new things. Plus I don't mind eating like a vegetarian every once in a while!   I ordered the spicy po boy & decided to enjoy a nice cold kilt lifter along with that. That po boy was one of the best I've ever had! It came with mock chicken which was kind of hard to eat because when you take a bite, it doesn't break apart that easily. It was like I took a bite and the whole piece came out right with it haha. The buffalo sauce was a bit overpowering. It had this tang to it that really hits you. When I took a bite and inhaled some air through my mouth, that buffalo sauce completely just choked me. That's the only thing that I didnt like about the sandwich. It wasn't drenched in Buffalo sauce so it balanced out very well.   The ice/water machine is funny! It has pictures of ice cube (the rapper) face on it. Overall it's a very chill place! Kind of small on the inside but I'd definitely come back to eat here again to try different items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried a bad thing here yet!  This is a great place for nonvegetarians and vegetarians alike. The \"mock\" meat tastes just like the real thing.  Everyone I take there loves this place.    The atmosphere is super casual with couches to sit on as we'll as tables and booths. The service is always super quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by informing you that I have been vegan for 15 years and have a couple of vegan kids. I am over all of the healthy vegan trendy foods. In my humble opinion, it takes a near act of God to make quinoa taste like food that a non-ancient Inca would enjoy. The same goes for acai, or as I like to call it \"dirt fruit.\" Part of the reason that I choose to be vegan is health, but another part is because I enjoy eating good food.   The reason that I give Green five stars is because they make tasty, straight forward vegan grub. It's not pretentious, nor does it get too adventurous for its own good. I don't live close by, but every time we come to spring training (What? A vegan baseball fan? I thought they were all hippies. Are you sure it isn't practice for burning man?) I make an effort to eat here.   I'm used to having one or two choices from a menu, and it's always a little overwhelming to have so many choices. I asked the cashier what they recommended and she directed me to the item voted \"best faux chicken sandwich in the US\" by VegNews, the Secret BBQ Chicken. She did not steer me wrong- it was great. My 6 year old wanted the peanut sauce noodle bowl, but it was too spicy for his sensitive, young palate. When I told the woman up front (after avoiding the long, Saturday dinner line) she said that it was no problem, and gave us a No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich for my son, who loved it. I offered to pay and she refused. Right there, she made a customer for life. You should be too.  After all this, I didn't get one of the fantastic looking Soy-Nami deserts. What a mean dad.  I'm happy to see Green doing so well in a location that requires its diners to seek it out. Your mouth and your conscience will be satiated with every meal."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is excellent! The burgers are our favorites, but the salads and rice dishes are tasty, too. Great beer and wine selection, and their gigantic sangria is very good."}
{"text":"YUM!  This place is amazing.  I am not vegan anymore, but I still love cooking and eating vegan every once in awhile.  This place does it well.  Amazing flavors, great options, and Stronghold wine on tap!!  My birthday is this weekend and I have veggie, vegan, and gluten free friends, along with bachelor types that eat burgers.  I know going here will make everyone happy.  My only complaint... I wish there was one in San Diego!!"}
{"text":"In the Phoenix area for business, I ate at Green two days in a row. The atmosphere is pleasant,  the crowd is cool, the menu is relatively diverse.  I enjoyed the spicy buffalo chick*n po boy and vanilla shake a lot. The rice bowl on tbe second day was mediocre at best. I wish they had a frequent quest card/club, where you could receive a free entrée after purchase of 8 or 10 - unfortunately,  they don't."}
{"text":"Great place to chill! Features local art... Eco friendly... Tsoynami is equal to a DQ Blizzard... But no animals were harmed! And the soft serve soy ice cream is home made! Get the big WAC, and wings... Great flavor. Def. junk food for vegans.. But what a treat! Service is friendly and prompt. Certain hours are iffy... Perhaps shift change, or conflict amongst coworkers... Still, a gem!"}
{"text":"I am no longer a vegetarian, though one of my best friends is. When she visits Arizona, Green is one of her stops where I happily tag along. We recently went twice in one week. I hadn't been for years prior and it looked like they had remodeled the restaurant. I ordered the Big Wac and fries for my first visit. I enjoyed the burger and the fries were decent. On the next visit I tried the Chicago Cheeseteak and was not impressed. I honestly should have tried a salad instead but I wanted to try the greasy vegan food items!!! The food is also expensive in my opinion so I think of it as a treat."}
{"text":"Mexicali burger is aces.  Cheers to the mock Chicken teriyaki bowl"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. I've taken many meat-eaters with NO complaints! If ordering fries (or other sides) I'd say you should have 2 or more in your party or it's a waste of money and food. Everything is super filling! I'm not a huge fan of vegan cheese so get the chili fries with no cheese if your unsure.  The downtown location (second location in Scottsdale) has the option of serving liquor as well as Nami the wonderful vegan bakery next door and outdoor seating.   I only left off a star due to the atmosphere which is somewhere between diner and cafeteria and the prices which seem a little steep (keeping in mind I always leave full and stayed that way for hours!)   Try it out for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Food is fabulous! Decent service.  I am not a vegan, came with my son who is.  I ordered the cheese steak"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Big wap was unbelievable!  It took me a while to find a spot to park my truck tho, parking lit is tiny and its packed!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians deserve cheat days to eat good deep fried food too!!! Welcome to  Green New American Vegetarian. As a carnivore, I must say, this place is very good. I have had their buffalo sandwich and the BFF. Both are outstanding and I will order both again. Their thyme fries are very average. They have a large juice section as well. The ambiance is fast food casual with some cool modern art hanging around the walls and for sale. Order atthe counter, they will bring out the food, and make sure to clean up after yourself. This isn't a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Causal and city wine cafe ambiance. The food isn't the healthiest, but is very good and all vegetarian. Living with 2 vegetarians, this is a great place to let them eat with their taste buds and not their brains."}
{"text":"I think this place is OK. I believe most people who like it are new to vegitarian-vegan items."}
{"text":"Feel excited to eat amazing vegan food, leave having eaten so much you with you hadn't  Its amazing in moderation. I'd like to actually manage to save room for desert next door one day."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place. The one in Phoenix is cool cause it has a bakery next door but the Tempe one is great cause you don't have the parking issues you sometimes have in Phoenix. As a long time vegetarian my girlfriend and I have visited several vegetarian and vegetarian friendly places throughout the valley and always end up coming back here. Their food is spectacular and the staff is always very nice. Try the Buffalo wings or the crab puffs. The BBQ chicken sandwich is good too but a bit simple. If you're in Tempe (and possibly Phoenix) try the soynamis they're awesome."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this vegetarian restaurant. They have a wide selection of food to chose from and it's all so good. My favorite things to get there are the jerk tofu salad, the spicy peanut chicken salad, the green hummus and the spicy peanut tofu. You really can't go wrong with anything you order though. For those of you that don't even like vegetarian foods, well try this place because it will certainly change your mind."}
{"text":"Always a winner when we visit AZ, from Appetizer to Dessert, a great meal all around!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for all vegan lunch on our road trip across Arizona, and so glad we stopped!   This place is totally a gem worth finding. From the cool laid back bohemian-hipster atmosphere, to the friendly staff and great selection of eats, this place is off the charts.   A lot of restaurants really try at this, and the bar was set high from living in Austin, and having a lot of that culture within an arms length, we were spoiled. However, I am looking forward to my next road trip just so I can try new things and eat great food while on the road.   Locals you are truly gifted a wonderful vegan eat spot! Try the buffalo \"wings\" - they are incredible!"}
{"text":"The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.  Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for \"ditto\" instead of the \"diablo red bowl\".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her \"coconut curry bowl\" shared in that sentiment.  The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites étaient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!  Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused \"sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont\".  I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!"}
{"text":"I love Green because it's just a short bike ride away from my apartment. During the afternoon it seems like it's always busy, sometimes too busy and I take the food to go. Now I'm not a vegetarian but I do love vegetarian food. The bowls are so tasty, I usually get the peanut thai or the mongolian. I've tried all the mock meats and my favorite is the mock beef. My favorite part of Green is the tsoynami's!! I always get the Soy Captain which has fresh strawberries and Captain Crunch Cereal. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere always has a positive buzz."}
{"text":"I understand how business works, price increases happen for a myriad of reason; leases, raw materials, salaries and wages, all understood. It just really sucks to see the big price increases and the menu change. Burgers are priced the same as before but now you must pay extra for sides. It was 'affordable' but now it's almost $15/person to eat here. Food is as delicious as it always has been, but the new prices are leaving a bad taste in my mouth (see what I did there)"}
{"text":"We finally had an opportunity to drive to Green's Phoenix location and it was amazing!   First we had the artichoke gratine, which was very artichokey, not very cheesy. With heavenly Daiya vegan cheeses and Tofutti ricotta cheese out there, it is possible to make ooey-gooey vegan dishes. However, the gratine was still tasty.   The vegan crab puffs were crispy and had a nice texture, but fell a little flat with flavor. Perhaps a dash or two of kelp flakes would give them a bit of ocean spark. The dipping sauce and lime wedge added extra needed kick though.   The absolute delight of the meal was the big Wac sandwich-- 2 veggie burgers that had an awesome flame broiled taste were smothered in a special sauce and then layered with pickles, lettuce, and onions. All this between two sesame seed buns-YUM!!! Next weekend, (if we wait that long!!) we are going to try the BBBQ (vegan)bacon burger and mac n cheez with veggies.  I Love vegan comfort food!!!"}
{"text":"This place was all it promised to be. In the signage is kind of hidden but once you find it, you walk into a very nice airy atmosphere. The selections are vast. There is something for even the most hardcore meat eater (me). I tried the Big Wac. Loved it! Better than Big Mac . Fríes... Delish. I'll come back often."}
{"text":"Green totally fulfills the need for the college town to have a collegey, hippey, hip, dim-lit vegan restaurant. I like the ambience though I couldn't find it the first time I was there. The options are pretty expansive and the pricing very very reasonable.   I have always been a vegetarian, so while meat eaters love the authenticity of the mock meat texture, I wouldn't say I was entirely comfortable with all the mocks. On one of my million visits, the flavors of one of the dishes (a rice dish that I can't recall now)  didn't work for me, but that is probably just me. And it was just once."}
{"text":"Im not a vegetarian so take this review with a grain of salt. I found the place to be a bit dirty and the food to be lackluster.  It was OK but if you want healthy and veggie I feel like Chop Shop is a much better type of option. This place is trying a bit too hard to be trendy. Hipsters working the counter and overall feeling of dirtiness to the place.  The Ice Cream is good but it's soy. Do your research on Soy before getting too excited."}
{"text":"Liked them before,  and now they have beer! Don't have to be Vegan to like the food.  you won't feel empty. Only gripe,  and minor... The limes in the food were dry."}
{"text":"Green is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in the Valley. The ingenuity of offering comfort vegan food is matched by its excellent and delicious execution of the concept. Here you can find inventive takes on veghead staples such as salads and Thai-inspired noodle dishes to daring vegan versions of chili fries and hot wings (made from mushroom stems) that prove worthy rivals to the animal-involved originals. The bistro features a varied menu, bolstered by specials that change daily. Green also features a handful of prepackaged vegan specialty foods, including gelatin-free marshmallows.  Perhaps what I like best about Green is its hip, progressive vibe that has not fallen victim to the snotty hipster nonsense so prevalent in The Valley's \"cool\" restaurants. On the contrary, the staff at Green is always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan comfort food restaurant in Phoenix!    I've tried several vegan restaurants since going vegan and this one is the winner that I keep going back to.  Again this is comfort food...  The Big Wac (totally tastes like a Big Mac) - I've been back for this several times! Their Buffalo Wings are good as is the Cheese Steak sandwich. They have Animal Fries!  Yum.  They have specials regularly.  The Carne Asada Fries that was excellent - wish they would keep it on the menu!  I don't care much for vegan cheese, however theirs is great.  They know how to flavor for a totally savory meal.  Nami is next door for vegan desert afterwards!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and love this place when I am in Phoenix.  It's super casual and in a very veggie prone area of Phoenix of 7th street.  The menu is very user friendly with juices, sandwiches, salads,  burgers, and small bites in which you can mix and match.  It's almost hard to decide but what I love about this place is if you get their handhelds which is the burgers and sandwiches you get to choose your side and there are all kinds to choose from fruit to vegan chile to coleslaw and even brussels sprouts.  Now I know there are many people who hate brussels sprouts but believe me they probably make the best ones in the entire planet, if you don't like these then yes stay away from brussels sprouts period:).  My go to dish is the dagobeah jungle which is a fancy word for jerk spiced brussels sprouts over salad tossed with a jamaican dressing and tortilla chips. You can also get this as a wrap.  If you don't like spice then avoid this dish but if you do you are in for a treat.  It's got this great spice and the brussels sprouts a so amazing the way they char them.  It's perfectly filling for lunch.  The burger here is also like crack and I love that with coleslaw.  Now here is the deal.  This place is so reasonable it's almost like I feel guilty how little I pay for such a great fresh meal.  I end up tipping handsomely even though you walk up and order yourself.  As far as beverages they have a whole line of fruit drinks from teas to ginger lemonade and you pay one price (again cheap) and you get unlimited refills.  This is cool because I got to try them all.  Some are a little sweeter than I like so I stuck with the tea and the berry one and added water and ice to make it exactly how I wanted.  It's all self serve so it's great.  They also have beers on tap and  wines and they give you a nice selection.  Overall I'm a fan and will keep coming back.  Win win win!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Everything is delicious and there are many choices. Top any meal off with a specialty ice cream and you are set. Non vegetarians i have invited are surprised and satisfied."}
{"text":"For being, basically, the only vegan restaurant in the downtown area, these people deserve 5/5. I've rarely had mishaps with my food and even when I do the food is still delicious. For being vegan, this place is the best of the best. The fries are a bit skinny for my liking but I still devour pleasingly them with the seasonings and ketchup and fake ranch provided. They now offer alcohol, which is a major plus for the demographic nearby. You have to try the wings. They are delectable, especially for carnivores. And the food is downright delicious. Make sure to check out Nami, next door, for their brunch on Sundays or their Tsoynamis any day of the week!"}
{"text":"The food was good for vegan, specially the chicken. Overall the service was not as friendly as I would hope, price was more then expected and overall not a welcoming place unless you were a reoccurring customer. For a place that services alcohol I am surprised at how the food is ordered and make sure the line goes the right way or the employees have no problem telling you to move."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant. My husband son and I go on Sundays for brunch and order take out for dinners. Amazing is an understatement! The staff is the best, really down to earth! I love everything about this place! Thank you for the awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"Get the Big Wac. Just get it. I absolutely cannot tell the difference between this one and The Big Mac from Mcdonalds; so if you're craving junk food, may as well do it meat-free!"}
{"text":"This place had a funky ambiance and great menu options. I loved the Goku v Vegeta jars almost as much as I loved the chili fries. It's nice to know places like these make eating vegan easier."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wings: For me, this was the standout. SO GOOD. Indeed it was so good that I actually had to make sure I didn't eat too many and not leave any. I don't want to be the hog when sharing a dish after all. The wings are like small little nuggets covered in buffalo sauce that tastes legit. I wish I had some right now!  Kung Pao Noodles: Huge disappointment for me. Lacked flavor, spice, or anything to redeem it. I'm begging you to try something else and trust me on this one. It will not fill that \"I am craving Asian food\" void you might be feeling. It won't even fill that \"I would like something with flavor\" void. Harsh, but true.  The meatball sammy looked amazing, and the side fries were VERY good. I like the smaller fries that pack just the right crispy. I totally wish I would have ordered that dish!  I shared one of the ice cream things. I didn't really find myself being blown away but it is what it is. If you can only have soy then it might hit your sweet spot.  Overall its a solid spot, and I would try some other dishes. However it isn't so good that I'm dreaming of it here in SD...well ok, maybe those wings........."}
{"text":"How does this place have such a high rating?  We went on a recommendation and were excited for the healthier versions of wings!  VERY disappointed. The wings were too spicy, the salad was underwhelming, the fake chicken had no flavor. Luckily, we were in downtown PHX so it wasn't too out of the way otherwise, we would have been even more bummed. We are both non-vegetarian but LOVE vegetarian food and will have to keep searching for our go to place.  Save your money and cook better veggie dishes at home."}
{"text":"I love love Green! I just moved less than 5 minutes away so I try to go here as much as I can when i'm craving delicious vegan food! The place is super easy to find, the parking lot is pretty large so that is never an issue which is nice. There is seating outside of the restaurant and inside so when it does get busy there are both options, although since it is starting to get hot I wouldn't particularly want to sit outside now. Everything i've tried on the menu is delicious, i've never had a bad meal here. The animal fries are a definitely must try menu item and the Thai peanut is so good. The employees are always so nice and make sure everything is right when you order. The prices are definitely fair, especially since other vegan restaurants are a lot higher with pricing their items. Their homemade teas you can get as a drink option are all delicious and refreshing! I definitely recommend coming here if you're vegan, or not the food is that great!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. My friends and I only tried the soy ice creams, but I want to come back and try the foods.   I like the chill, hip mood inside. It's a perfect place to come and chat with someone. On one side of the restaurant are car doors. There are plenty of tables and booths.   You order & pay for your food at the cashier, you get a number on a stand and the waiters come and deliver it to your table.  I tried the cookie dough ice cream, which was pretty good. I noticed they had some korean items, which I'm interested in trying next time."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Just wish prices were a bit cheaper - sides are extra to add with sandwich or burger. Big WAC is so good and one of my faves."}
{"text":"There are several foods that are worthwhile, but I have had some that are average. The wings and ranch is the best food they have; the bowls are, well, underperformers. The burgers are very good, and their pizzas are worthwhile. Green is good for quick vegan on the go, and I think that most of the food is good at Green. It is definitely college-aged ambiance dining in. I'd really love to see the veg world in Phoenix take off, and find some competition. It's a limited pool here in town."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass.  I'm a huge fan of non-hippie vegetarian food.  I hate the idea that you have to just eat veggies all the time.  With the advances we made in soy products, it is nice to see someone really going to town with quality ingredients.  So I ordered the buffalo chicken po-boy.  SOOO good.  Plus it came with fries.  Can't hate fries.  It's really hard to describe the texture of the sammie but it was exactly what I expected and it was brilliant.  I literally can't wait to go back.  I think I ask my wife every weekend if we can go.  It's so good."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the vegan or vegetarian. Pretty much everything on the menu is top notch."}
{"text":"Jordan is amazing!!! You leave feeling like her best friend. She is so fun to talk to and gives you honest opinions on what would look best on you!"}
{"text":"I'm not a critic and neither are you... However, Yelp can serve as a fantastic forum to help spread the word about fantastic local business. Green, and also Nami at both locations, is some of the absolute finest Vegan cuisine, and hands down the best Vegan comfort food in AZ. It gets busy and they deserve it, so be ready to wait if you show up at 6pm on a weekend. There isn't a single bad thing on the menu... all of the bowls are awesome. The Big Wac and the BBBQ Tempeh Bacon burger are the best veggie burgers you will have... period. Hook up a Tsoynami if you know what's good for ya! The staff rules, the food rules and it's a great way to support Tempe, and PHX business."}
{"text":"When you call, place a $40 to-go order with a ten minute wait & the person on the phone repeats your to-go order, one expects to get the right sides with the sandwiches. This was correct for 1/3 of the sides. If you were out of a side, you had my phone number to offer us something else or ask us when we arrived. Don't get me wrong, your fries are great, but 2 of us were really craving some of your cole slaw. Bad on us for not checking when we picked up, but I sent my husband to grab the goods. The big wac wasn't as great as it usually is. There was a definite lack of sauce, which I believe makes this mock burger so great! Haven't placed a to-go order in a while, because during busy times you can see your to-go order sitting on the counter, ready, while you have to wait in line to pick up & pay for it while others are in line deciding what to order. If I had the time to dine in, I wouldn't mind, but I am picking up a to-go order due to my lack of time. We love your restaurant, but the customer service isn't what it used to be either. We have been coming here since becoming vegan in 2013. Wanted to keep giving Green a chance, because we love your restaurant, but don't feel like our business with you is important anymore. I wish Green the best in expansion & hope that your growth doesn't also come with lacking in the customer service department."}
{"text":"This place is beyond great! Out of all of the years I've been coming here, I've never had food that I didn't enjoy. I usually get chili, eggless rolls and fries, bur I went this weekend and finally tried the big wac. IT IS SO GOOD! I will definitely be ordering it every time from here on out. Ambiance is great, staff is super friendly and they always have a decent selection of beer! Definitely recommend! PS bring back the mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. But it was good for what is was - diner type vegan food. We got the buffalo wings to share and I got the Big Wac burger. The buffalo wings were okay. It was slightly sweet and spicy. But, I didn't like the sauce runny. I wish the sauce was gooey and nicely glazed on the wings, but it was runny and the wings were just sitting in a pool.   As for the burger, this was the best vegan burger I have ever had. The patty was the closest to taste and consistency to a real beef patty. BUT, I was so disappointed with the \"secret sauce.\" I could barely taste anything AND my burger barely had any sauce in it. The thing I detest the most is a dry sandwich. This burger falls short from perfection because of the flavorless sauce and the lack of sauce."}
{"text":"Whoot! Finally an awesome veggie place that serves tasty mock meat and alternative fooooodddssss! I lament the fact that Vegas, which is a major city as well, doesn't have anything even close to this place.  First off, the serve every vegan, vegetarian and organic eater alike, and the food is GOOD! So good, even my carnivore boyfriend liked it. I got the Thai Orange bowl with mock chicken, and he got the No Harm Parm chicken Po'boy. The Thai bowl seemed to be very popular since I saw nearly half the people in there with it, and it was very good, full of fresh veggies cooked perfectly and not at all soggy, with a semi-spicy sauce to die for, but only a few pieces of mock chicken. His meal, however, with the giant Po'boy and tasty potato tots was fricken AWESOME. I tasted his mock breaded chicken and nearly cried. It was like a biscuit covered in country gravy and soooo moist.  They have really cool alternative sodas and organic lemonades- I got my favorite Zevia cherry cola and he got the cup (which you can go and choose from three lemonades, endlessly) and got the organic berry lemonade. The place is really cool too, but kinda hard to find if you have never been there, only because it is so laid back and not \"HERE WE ARE VEGGIES\". It's sign is very dark, but no worries, just remember it is right by Coco's. Parking is very tight, so I advise to park either at Coco's, or down the side street by Coco's in the residential neighborhood and walk."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend after reading about how awesome this place was. Upon entering, I noticed another good friend of mine sitting at a table, waiting for the lunch he had ordered. He had been waiting for 15 minutes for his sandwich, and it took another 10 for it to arrive. Not a good sign! 25 minutes for a sandwich! They were busy..but he didn't order anything crazy.   It was hot inside. The first thing I notice when I walk into a building, is how comfortable the temperature is. Green made me sweat.  I ordered an iced latte which was amazing. To eat, I ordered the coconut curry with chikn. The buddy I brought along, ordered the same thing, but with crispy tofu. It took about 20 minutes for our food to be brought to our table..The potatoes in this dish were perfectly cooked, and tasty. Everything else in my bowl was mediocre...and actually kind of bland. The friend we ran into said Green's menu items are hit or miss. I will give it another try someday."}
{"text":"Love love love love absolutely love this place. Best vegan/vegetarian ever,  hands down.   I got my family to eat vegan food. The meat \"imitation\"....  they couldn't tell. Haha. Chicken, meat or sea food. Nope. Not at all. My cousin said \" what? this isn't real meat? This is awesome.\" Hahaha  I come here for dinner and nami which is next door for brunch :) my favv.  I always come back.  Always."}
{"text":"My friends and I have visited two of the locations while in town, and we love Green! The food is fresh and delicious, and there are lots of tasty beverages to choose from. I LOVE the house tofu, which is battered and lightly fried. Be warned: it can get very busy around lunch time, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love. So great. I had the secret bbq chicken sandwich- mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in espresso bbq sauce with vegan mayo and thyme fries. Hubby had the Texas mushroom po boy. Both really great tasting, soft bun- messy, good stuff! We also had the crab puffs- very tasty. I headed next door to Nami to get some iced coffees and a oatmeal cookie sandwich and peanut butter cupcake to go. Also totally fabulous!  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest food, even if it's vegetarian.  Also portions are small, so you still are hungry after eating a bowl.  Finally, the hours suck.  Went there on a Saturday night at 9pm, closed. Are you kidding me?   I prefer Chipotle or other places for my veggie fix."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Green a couple times, and I don't think I will ever go back there with the intention of eating a meal. I might consider one of their rice dishes, but nothing else. The sandwiches are  extremely greasy. I've had the original \"g\" spicy po-boy, which is a buffalo chicken sandwich with some faux meat. It just tasted like grease and buffalo sauce. I got the chicago cheesesteak on another occasion to try out their seitan, and it was just a greasy mess too...greasier than the real thing. I've also had the chicken nuggs and the texture leaves a lot to be desired and is quite flavourless. I think I need to try something without the faux meats and stick to tofu or just veggies to get a good meal there. I'll probably give them one more chance for lunch by getting a rice bowl and maybe update my review at that time if it improves my impression of their food.   I have come here for tsoynamis, and they aren't that consistent with making them. I usually get more than one, and one usually has noticeably more dessert than the other. I wish they were more consistent with these.   The pastries are a bit pricey, so I haven't tried any of those. I bought one of those really dark energy bars though, with the semolina and stuff in it. I didn't like it at all. It was way too sweet and the texture was off. I wouldn't spend my money on it again.   It's nice to have a vegan place in the metro area, but besides the tsoynamis, there are better options for a good healthy vegan meal."}
{"text":"Our kids are challenging us to have a more vegan way of life. This is one way to convince us that there is nothing lacking in the lifestyle. Great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Overall our experience at Green was great. We ordered crab puffs, artichoke gratine and samosas to share and sat on the back patio which was nice. The food was tasty and I was really excited for the crab puffs as I've never had them made vegan. It is worth noting that part of each of these appetizers was deep fried so they were a bit oily so they probably shouldn't be a meal which is what we attempted to do. The staff was very friendly and there were so many options on the menu that it was hard for us to decide what to order. We will need to return multiple times to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I love the big whack!  Very filling and tasty.  I have taken non-vegan/vegetarian people here, and they enjoy it too!!"}
{"text":"Yay I love this place. Are you a vegan or vegetarian and miss American classics? I typically don't, but on that off chance you miss a burger and animal style fries... You found your place. I kept feeling nervous and asking if it was actually vegan. They also have that more traditional \"vegan\" food... You know the delicious tofu bowls and stuff so you really gave options. Side note, they actually have beers on tap and house sangrias that are fantastic AND if you save room Nami is 20ft away and you can get down on a Sounamu for dessert."}
{"text":"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent \"manhood\" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.  There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...\"Asshole\".  He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...\"vote with your feet\"...but I guess that's another review.  The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!  At the very tippy top of the \"near and dear\" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.  Whit is a Vegan...with a capital \"Vege\"...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.  So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!  I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!  I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!  We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!  Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!  The big question about Green is \"why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?\"  I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.  I like to \"fit in\".  The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.  I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).  I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!  I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!"}
{"text":"This place has my soul! They are mostly Organic and NON GMO and 100% Vegan! I have never had a bad experience eating here, the food is always delicious! I take my non-vegan friends here all the time and they love it! They cant believe that their eating a vegan meal.   I was here yesterday and ordered the black jack pita with thyme fries and it was AMAZING! I had some elderberry ice tea that they had made and it was so refreshing I think I refilled like 3 times !"}
{"text":"I love Green.  I hate that there is not one closer to Peoria.  So it is special treat to go there.  My favorites are the buffalo wings, apricot miso bowl with mock chicken, the original g po boy (which tastes like the buffalo wings, so don't get them together).  The fries are also excellent, and I'm not even a huge french fry eater.  I want to like the crab puffs, but I'm not vegan, and I still love my real cream cheese.  Oh well.  Love the Soynamis when I'm not so stuffed that I can eat them, but that hasn't happened very much!"}
{"text":"Love Green!  I had the buffalo wings and the crab ragoons. Very busy on a Saturday night, but I found a spot on the patio!  Right next door to Nami so I also got my dessert on. Wish they'd open one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Yowza has this place sadly gone downhill. Prices are up, quality is down. The last few times I went there, I got sick, really sick. :( I really hope this place can one day go back to the quality it used to be."}
{"text":"Sadly this place has gone downhill.  It used to be great,  really high quality food.  The quality has sadly lowered. I don't know if they changed the oil they use,  it seems like they have, but it definitely is not being heated up enough changed or not.  The fries are no longer crispy,  the fake chicken was slipping out of its breading and it was extremely greasy. This has been over the last five times we have gone so it seems to be a permanent change at both locations.  My family and I are sad regulars who will no longer be returning and we have been going since the store opened.  Bye bye Green :( it was a good run while the food was still amazing."}
{"text":"Anyone who asks, \"are you a vegan to lose weight?\" should come to Green and eat their words. And everything else.  In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's \"Food you can eat that I actually like.\" Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.  Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.  On another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere. Even if you love steak more than anything in the world (and there are steak po'boys, might I add) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place."}
{"text":"Another Green? You mean, we don't all have to eat at Green in Tempe everyday? Vegans, scatter!   To be fair, this location doesn't have the super-customized hipster vibes of the original Green, as in, there aren't painted car doors lining the walls, but it offers the same great food in a metropolitan area. Plus, Nami is right next door, which is essentially a fat, animal-loving kid's heaven.  Currently, my nom of choice is the orecchiette with mock meatballs. If you're missing meat, or need to convince some judgmental bacon-lover that vegan food isn't a leaf on a piece of tofu, order this. Delicious, savory meatballs, smothered in cheese and marinara over veggies and pasta? Hardly part of an ascetic lifestyle. Oh, and it's eight bucks. Double awesome.  Nutshell Review: Tastebuds: delighted. Tummy: full. Wallet: fat. Conscience: clear."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Vegetarian and meat eater heaven. Please just go here and go here at least twice, and make sure one of them is breakfast.   Get anything and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"My first time at Green, I was unimpressed.  My second time at Green? I fell in love. The employees are all friendly (and even helped me out immensely when I lost my phone in their trash can - it was the worst :( ) and when I asked them what I should get (I love actually being able to do that!), the Original G was recommended to me. And man, did I enjoy it. I love spicy food, and the Original G is mock chicken with spicy buffalo sauce, lettuce, tomato, and vegan mayo. IT IS SO GOOD (and clears your sinuses out!). The thyme fries are absolutely awesome, as well. I could eat them all day.  The crab puffs are also so yummy, and completely different from what I expected! The puff itself is crunchy and flaky and delicious, and the mock crab is warm and creamy and so good. But above all, the shining part of the dish? The sauce they serve it with. SO GOOD.   Overall, I am so glad I gave Green a second chance. My advice? Go for the mock meat sandwiches. The bowls are ok, but the sandwiches are where Green truly shines."}
{"text":"Went here last night with three friends. Two had been here before, me and the other had not. Person number 1 ordered chili cheese fries. Person number 2 ordered a po boy. I ordered buffalo wings and crab puffs and person number 4 ordered the chicken parm sandwich. All food was enjoyed and it was all vegan meaning no dairy and no meat. But it tasted really good. One would never guess that it was all vegan. One of my favorite things there is the delicious juices they have... there was a berry one that was very good. Want to try the desert place next door."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We need a location in California!! It was so good. Everything we got. The desserts were especially delicious. You can not beat that root beer float! The chicken sandwich was so filling and had such a great taste. My husband and I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is pretty cool too. The only caveat is that the portions were a bit small and my mother asked for no onions and they still put them on her gyro. Still, even with those complaints, this place is an oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for dinner and it was AWESOME! She got a chicken sand which and a Pb Chocolate Soynami (which she said were both amazing). I got the burger and a Doughboy Soynami which were also fantastic! We'll defiantly be back soon!! Awesome place for new Vegans:)"}
{"text":"My version of fast/comfort food. Consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian restaurant and it actually caters to the vegans.  Try one of the specials."}
{"text":"Green is good. Green is great. So scrumptious you may lick your plate. Seriously. I was a fan of Green long before I moved to PHX. It'd be my 1st stop once off the plane, & my last stop before getting back on the plane. Now that I live here, I practically live there.   This is some of the best veg*n comfort food on the planet. I've had @ 95% of the regular menu items. My favs are:  Big Wac: a vegan version of the Big Mac that could fool even a carnivore. Delicious & super filling. (Those with smaller appetites may want to cut it in 1/2 or share it.)   Wendy's Pickle: crispy fried \"chicken\" pieces w/ vegan mayo, a spicy sauce, & of course, pickles. An explosion of flavor for your taste buds.   Argentine Po'Boy: savory seitan steak with perfectly grilled & seasoned onions & peppers, plus mayo & spicy sauce. mmmmmm Mouth-watering!  Original G Spicy Po'Boy: mock chicken in a buffalo sauce w/ vegan mayo. I get mine sans tomatoes & extra spicy. Amazeballs!   (You can request light spicy sauce if you're spice sensitive.)   There's a BBQ \"chicken\" sandwich & a BBQ Bacon Burger. Both are equally so amazing that I have to eenie-meenie-miney-mo in order to choose. Their BBQ sauce is excellent!  All of the above come with a side. I suggest the thyme fries. So fresh & tasty!  When I need something on the lighter side, I get: the Jerk Salad w/ mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing makes me want to beat my chest & proclaim, \"Me Jane!\"    My 2nd favorite salad is the Ranchero salad, which features their yummy BBQ \"wings.\" Go all out and add a side order of their buffalo \"wings\" for an epic party in your mouth.   The chili fries are very good...in the winter. I personally can't do chili in the PHX summers.   Then the chef comes up with these amazing specials, which they announce on their social media pages. Today, I had the San Diego \"Fish\" Tacos: crispy tofu (& I'm not a tofu fan) mock fish, in soft tortillas, with a special sauce. SO good!!   Don't you dare leave here without trying a Tsoynami (think dairy-free Blizzard). My favs are:  Soy Capitan (for a fruity sensation); Dough Boy (cookie dough, chocolate syrup & soft serve. Hello!); Cookies n' Cream (classic); & my own creation of pretzels, chocolate, & toffee nut syrup.   They'll sometimes have fresh baked goods too.   There's a small selection of vegan groceries.   They have a cold case with a large selection of beverages, including a very tasty Butterscotch Beer (non-alcoholic).   Nice decor. They have plenty of tables, but on a busy night, or during the lunch rush, it fills up quickly. I suggest calling in your order if you're in a hurry. There's a patio outside, but there's only one table at this time. (This may change once the weather exits Hades.)   Order at the counter, then take a number & commandeer a table.   The parking lot was recently repaved & remodeled, which has made for a better parking situation.   Green. Don't leave Phoenix without it!"}
{"text":"This Green location is an expansion of their Tempe location. Sometimes when establishments do good and grow, one or some of their locations suffer. Not here. You get the same great food that you've come to expect from Green. And in an ingenious business strategy, they'll offer different specials at each one.    For the sake of not being completely redundant, I'll just sum up my favorite dishes.   Vegan comfort food: Big Wac (simply amazing; that is all)  Wendy Pickle (awesome!)  Original G Spicy Chicken & the Argentine po'boys (both equally yum!)   BBQ Chicken or the BBBQ Burger (BBQ is on point!)   All of the burgers & sandwiches come with a side of your choice of fruit, thyme fries, or a Tahini coleslaw. (99% of the time, I choose their fries because they're SO good!)  Feeling light? Jerk Salad w/ their succulent & perfectly seasoned mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing is delicious!   Ranchero Salad, which comes with BBQ \"chicken\" & their homemade ranch. I hated ranch when I was omni, but I like their vegan ranch.   Both of my fav aforementioned salads come with a spinach + dark medley salad mix (no icebergs here!), shredded carrots, & tortilla strips. You may opt for a 1/2 or full sized salad ($6 vs $9). I usually get the full and eat the 2nd 1/2 another day. Just remove the mock meat, heat, & replace on salad. Unless you remove the tortilla strips prior to refrigerating your leftovers, those will be annoyingly non-crunchy the next day.   This location has liquor options for all of my beer guzzling and mimosa-loving lushes. (Which is ALL of my friends.) I don't drink, so I am unable to assist in that area, except to say that they have drink specials sometimes.   Speaking of... This location implemented it's first happy hour this summer. It's not every day or every Friday, so I suggest stalking, er, following Green on Twitter, ig, & FB for the fastest updates & news.  Happy Hour specials have included delights such as Sloppy Jose's (sic) sliders, Buffalo Cauliflower bites, Roasted Brussels, & Garlic Potato tacos. All beyond amazing for my taste buds. (Happy hour prices extend to certain alcoholic drinks as well.) HH has only been at this location, so far.   Live music sometimes.   Nice and clean inside. Pay at the counter, take a number, & they'll bring your food to your table.  If you prefer fresh air, there are a handful of tables outside.    The restrooms are outside of the building. I am extremely OCD & shuttered at the thought. But when I was finally forced to utilize the facilities, let me tell you! That has to be the nice & cleanest little \"outhouse\" in the history of outhouses. I was very pleasantly surprised!   It shares a parking lot with its sister store, Nami. It's a small lot & it fills quickly during lunch & dinner times. If you're going for lunch, M-F, I suggest arriving no later than 11:30am, to beat the lunch crowd.   One of my favorite restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"Fake chicken has never tasted so good. The \"diablo\" dish is really really nice."}
{"text":"Amazing. New to vegan and I've been here twice. It has restored my hope that healthy conscientious food can also be delicious. Big Wac, no brainer. Sampled many things off my families plates and they were equally as delicious. Decor is also very unique and interesting making it fun. Parking can get a little tough but it's worth the effort. Staff are so very nice, friendly, and helpful. Next door offers some of the best vegan desserts in town. We make the drive from Lake Pleasant and it's worth every mile. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food but a rude order taker behind the counter today. Short guy with brown hair...didn't thank us and before we even moved out of the way he was already talking to the people behind us. I made a quick change but apologized for the hassle and no response from him. Bro...if you hate your job go get a new one but you're ruining the experience for the rest of us."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last night. I am newly vegetarian and was struggling with craving a burger and fries or just something real Americana. Found this place through Yelp, and decided to try it.   I ordered the Big Wac, the bff, and the fries. I have zero complaints. I enjoyed every bite of both! I saved half of each for the next day. The bff is as close to a fried chicken sandwich as you can get and the big wac will make you question if it is vegetarian. So in love with this place!  Also, I placed my order to go and it was out in less than 10 mins. Excellent front end service, very warm and inviting cashier."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in all of AZ.   Green proves that vegetarian, and more importantly, VEGAN food can be interesting and delicious. More importantly, the dishes served here can fullfill your junk-food cravings.  I am a vegetarian, but not usually a fan of mock meat products. Green does such a great job at creating tasty vegan creations that the mixed crowd will amaze you. Not to stereotype the vegan \"look\", but if you come in to Green during the very busy lunch rush, I would bet money that 50% of the patrons are regular meat-eaters. The food is just THAT good!  I have tried most everything on the menu, and my personal favorites are:  spicy buffalo \"wings\" jerk tofu salad mexicali burger thai peanut bowl with crispy tofu original \"g\" spicy po-boy sammy  One more thing:  They always have delicious daily specials and homemade desserts."}
{"text":"I am a carnivore and I love Green! I feel that should be said prior to beginning this. The food is healthy, tasty, and well made. I am slightly addicted to their samosa.... Okay. I lied. Totally addicted. Their noodle bowls are fun and I have enjoyed their sandwiches and burgers. I have not been disappointed. Great food all around."}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian. I come here because the food is good (and healthy), the staff is super nice and prices at very reasonable. they have a lot of normal meals that are just made with vegan substitutes."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants I have ever gone to.   My husband and I were traveling in arizona so I did some research on  veggie restaurants in the area and found this one on yelp.  I just can't stop talking about how great the food was and the atmosphere rocked.   If I had not looked it up prior to going, we would have never found it as it is in a small strip mall not close to the downtown area.   We ended up going here twice on our vacation and tried the burgers as well as one of the bowls.   This is as good as it gets hands down for veggie food.  Loved it."}
{"text":"All I can say is I'm very sad there is not one of these in the Bay Area . I may or may not have came here a couple times In a couple of days before I left back home . So amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I read reviews on Yelp all the time, but it takes something special to cause me to write one.  Green's food absolutely blew me away.  The flavors and combinations are just amazing.  I was in Phoenix on business and ate here 5 times in 3 days.  The sandwiches are the best vegan sandwiches I've ever eaten, and the salads are great too.  Friendly staff and a cool atmosphere top it off."}
{"text":"in brief: Yum yum in my tum tum! their vegan dishes are enjoyable even for the carnivorsaurs. However, if you're not vegan, pass on the soy-based \"ice creams\"  I ordered:   1. Mac and Cheese with Veggie ($7.50):  Delish! It was warm cheesy and gooey and just all the positive adjectives you would want to associate with a mac and cheese. I could tell from taste that it wasn't normal cheese, but it was still delicious none the less! It's a cheddar based cheese sauce with elbow macaroni, with broccoli, zucchini and carrots. The taste was spot-on as a vegan mac and cheese, although the macaroni were a little softer than I'd like; definitely not al dente. I'm thinking its because vegan pasta noodles cooks differently than regular pasta noodles, so it's not fair for me to complain :)   2. Banana Cream Pie-- one of their Soy, vegan \"ice creams.\"  (~$5 for 16 oz) This flavor i had ordered was their special, it was banana cream pie. It was good enough to cool you down on a hot day, but it was meh tasting. The base tastes like soy milk with thickener, and it was mixed with added banana slices and then topped with a blahhh tasting whip-toping. :(  Although it wasn't too sweet, and I appreciated that; but I'd much rather have a pint of hagen daaz of coffee ice-cream for half the price at a supermarket than to get this.  I would definitely come back to try their other items! I had a piece of their mock chicken and mock-bbq meat, both as were delicious in salads!  Recommendation: try one of their bowls! There are many exciting ones to try on the menu!"}
{"text":"Holy mother of veganism this place rocks!  I'm an occasional meat eater and not ashamed about admitting it. But going to this place makes every carnivorous instinct in my body shrivel with shame. If more places like this exist, there would be no more meat-eaters in the world. I know it.  Seriously, every dish I've had here beats its non-vegetarian counterpart by several strides. The fake chicken tastes better than real chicken, especially when it's seasoned so well here.   Everything from the eggless spring rolls to the \"fake\" meat bowls and flatbread pizzas is wonderful. Top any dish with endless toppings for just $1 and finish your meal with a tsoynami dessert.  I only wish there's a place that is equally delicious in San Francisco. There probably is, but I just can't seem to find it...  -----  Distinguishing factor: This gem offers some of the best vegan dishes you will ever have. Especially in AZ."}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is in a crappy concrete shopping mall, it is certainly worth visiting for the green burger, samosas, peanut butter chocolate bars and the thyme fries. It's an overall excellent vegan spot that sells evamor water (hard to find in Tempe) that is light on ambiance. It's always packed and always good!"}
{"text":"Went to the tempe one originally, but love this new location. much prettier (not a strip mall), with the same great food. the green burger with thyme fries is still my favorite. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting a ton of vegan/vegetarian places in the world and this is in my top 5.  I had the \"chicken\" burger and it competed with many crispy chicken burgers I had back in my meat eating days.  If you're into fake meat this is a must try. If you're a veggie for the veggies, this might not be you're ideal spot."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother, his wife and friend..for the first time. They never had vegan or mock meats.  They are in love! Everything we had was amazing. Unfortunatly they all live out of state...but I am a fan..will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian restaurant. The name is a bit misleading for me because when I hear 'new american,' I expect something upscale. This is a very casual spot and no wait staff.   Food was good though. I ordered a Brussels sprout salad and a local craft beer. It was packed around noon on a Saturday and there was no seat. The Brussels sprout was crispy and well cooked and had really nice spicy dressing. I had no idea what to expect with this salad but I was really happy with it.   Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I would pay their rent if they'd open a store by my house!  I became a vegan about a year ago and was introduced to Green by my also newly vegan hair colorist. It is hands down my and my husbands favorite place!!! Though we can \"figure out\" something to eat at most of the restaurants we frequent, we love coming into Green and having an entire menu of deliciousness to choose from. I haven't tried anything I don't like, the specials are always fantastic and you don't have to be a super cool veg to enjoy the food. Last year we brought my mom to the \"Thanksliving\" dinner (kicking and screaming mind you) and she has not stopped talking about it! She tells everyone it was the best Thanksgiving meal she has ever eaten. Some of my favorites include any of their  \"chicken\" sandwiches, drunken mushroom bowl, \"tuna\" melt and the artichoke dip is UNREAL! Go and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not the best customer service kind of rude.. wasn't the most pleasant experience but the food is really good I can not complain there just wish they would have better customer service to all their guests!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Green. I've tried many other vegan restaurants in the valley and Green is by far my favorite. Please consider opening a Chandler location, I would be able to go way more often."}
{"text":"** Note:  This review is ONLY for their \"Soyname\" soft-serve soy ice cream.  Their ice cream is the BOMB.  It's soft-serve homemade soy icecream that tastes like real ice cream!  No gross soy taste or aftertaste, no weird consistency, just pure ice cream goodness!  I really don't know how they do it, nor do i care.  It's served \"blizzard\" style with a variety of add-ins to choose from.  My personal favorite is the vanilla soy ice cream with chocolate and mint syrup and chocolate chips mixed in.... heaven!  When I stopped eating dairy I was bummed and thought I would never again truly know the joys of an awesome ice cream treat, I was wrong.  I drive from Higley to this place just to get a Soyname, it's THAT good.  Even folks who don't eat dairy-free say it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Sooo... I'm not a vegetarian, but after biting into my first spicy \"wing\" the whole vegan, vegetarian lifestyle seems way more approachable. The wings are epic; not for vegan wings, but for wings in general-- and their ranch is delicious! I also ordered the Thai Peanut Bowl with house tofu and noodles. The portion is heaping and I would have probably had enough for leftovers, but it was all too good to stop eating. Everything excelled past my initial expectations, hence the 5 stars. It's a fast casual atmosphere so order at the counter and help yourself to a seat."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I've never seen a staff more annoyed and disappointed in having new customers, you could find more livelier service at a graveyard. Food was okay as there is better vegan food places downtown and even the Tempe location is superb but the worse past was the girl at the register. She was rude, didn't smile once, I asked her what she would recommend for my younger siblings and she briefly pointed at a few items on the menu without giving me a chance to see what she was point at and she didn't say a word when she did it either, for a second I thought she was a robot I could go on and on about remarks and lack of attentiveness from the staff probably won't return based on that"}
{"text":"We luv Green. Big Wac and secret bbq sammy were great tonight. I tried the dagobah jungle salad and did not like it. Had a bitter taste to me. It came highly recommended so maybe it's just me. Ranchero salad was delicious as usual. Very happy that all of our food (for our family of 5) came out at the same time. I can't remember the last time that happened at Green and that was always frustrating. Sometimes someone would be done with their meal before the rest of the food came out. Hopefully they've fixed that for good. Finished with tsoynamis next door at Nami of course. Yum."}
{"text":"Perfection!  This is a vegan joint. Don't let the name fool you.  Great staff, great food, great ambiance  Make a difference, show compassion and support this place by eating here.  I brought a \"meat eater\" (boo) and he loved this place.    Thanks for a great dinner"}
{"text":"I was over the moon to find that Tempe had a vegan restaurant to offer its visitors!   In a nutshell, the food is greasy and I felt like I had to do a cleanse after eating the samosa and chili fries.  The vegan soft serve was yummy and if I'm ever back in Tempe, I would stop by for this frozen treat.  This place is like junk food vegan in my opinion."}
{"text":"Okay vegans. If you need to be bad and not actually be bad, just fulfill your carnal evil desires....Big Wac & Wendy's Pickle. It's insane how much these things taste exactly like the real (yet dead and disgusting) things.  If you have a non vegan friend, these items would be an excellent phase one to conversion. Vegans really can and do have it all."}
{"text":"Love green, delicious food... whats more to say... could eat here everyday if I had the funds... big wac yumm!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian. I love meat. Yet, this place is absolutely delicious. I've tried a few noodle and rice bowls, their Big WAC, and now the Argentinian Po'Boy. The \"steak\" is moist, flavorful and full of spices. I can't believe it's not meat. Their peanut cole slaw is my favorite side. So good!   The parking lot is small so good luck during the lunch and dinner rush... But I've never seen it so packed that I had to drive away. I personally love sitting on either the patio out front by the sidewalk or in the back under a tree. They have excellent service and even make an attempt to remember your name if you become a frequent customer."}
{"text":"This place has been on my 'to try' list for a long time, but a little part of me always pushed off going here. This changed the other day when hanging with my buddy Dave H. We went here at lunch time. You walk up to the counter, order, and sit down to wait for food delivery. We ordered the hummus, the samosas, and the coconut curry bowl with the house tofu. We quickly had the hummus delivered and then.... crab puffs? Woops. Well, we had discussed the crabpuffs, so we figured they just put in the wrong order. That was ok, we were happy to try them. The crab puffs were good... I don't like regular crab puffs, but the veg version was fairly tasty, creamy, and crispy on the outside. The hummus was very good, a little spicy, but overall tasty... now, it was no Pita Jungle hummus... definitely not at the same caliber, but it was good. I liked the crispy pita chips, but I think it might be better with just normal pita. Anyway, I guess they realized they brought out the wrong item (crab puffs) and they brought us the samosas... woohoo! The samosas were by far the best item I tried there. They were cinnamon -y and delicious... crispy with a wonderful filling. I would come back here just for the samosas...yum. The curry bowl was also good, but I wish it had more sauce.... it wasn't the most flavorful food I've ever had, especially for a curry. I would want to try it again to see if maybe it was just lacking sauce on the day we were there. I will definitely be back here!   PS the decor here is beautiful, very clean and modern.  PPS the prices are affordable- less than 10$ per person"}
{"text":"Love Green!  Buffalo wings, fries and the whopper burger......delicious.   The iced teas are fresh and tasty as well.   Great selection of beer and wine too!   Num.  Num."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Green in an effort to be a little more healthy in 2010. Tucked away in the corner of a very inauspicious strip mall off Scottsdale Road I can't say I was excited as I walked up to the front door. Luckily that all changes when you walk in where you are greeted with a vibrant atmosphere, really friendly staff and fantastic photographs adorning the walls.  I had a spicy bean burger with to die for thyme fries and I could have eaten the meal twice it was so good. Fresh and tasty is how I would best describe my food and my companions choice too.   I was stuck in a bit of an East Valley rut last year going to the same old favorites but now I can add this terrific little restaurant to my list of regular haunts and I couldn't be happier about it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Be patient the line could be long. It's worth the wait order at counter they bring out to your table. The guy taking the order help out so much answering my questions about what is this Vegan mock meat. So I gave it a go and ordered the burger mock meat and side of fruit also had to have the Thyme fries they make their own ranch dressing yummy. I'm not usually crazy about Vegan type food but this place is definitely not your typical boring tofu dishes . Great menu , great service ! Easy parking and the line moves fast to order."}
{"text":"Pretty busy for a Monday night. Got the buffalo \"chicken\" sandwich and an knock off big mac.  Both were pretty good.  Fries were crisp and the fruit was fresh.  Prices were great compared with other vegan/vegetarian restaurants.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian food, although I'm not a huge fan of their fake processed meat products. I do like their bowls. Nice, casual ambience."}
{"text":"Seriously can not get enough of this place. I absolutely love the burgers and the animal style fries. The nami ice cream desserts are also delicious! I rave about this place all the time. Hands down my favorite vegan restaurant!"}
{"text":"Where to I start..I have been to this Green probably about 1 Gillion times (I realize this isn't a REAL #) and I can't recall the last time I was disappointed except when this location was closed for reconstruction, but I can't hold that against them.  Anywho I love this place and almost the entire menu with my favorites being the Big WAC, Thai Peanut bowl, Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\", Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy, and the Ranchero Salad with the Strawberry Shake and/or NO's 'n' Mint or Betterfinger tSoynomi for dessert.  My wife and I seriously go 1-2 times a week and LOVE it!  Yes, I understand it's a problem but I'm OK with that."}
{"text":"I can only give this place a 5 star rating because of its completely vegan menu and consistency!  On my most recent visit, I had the Spicy Chkn Po' Boy, Thyme Fries, and Sangria. The fries were a wee bit cold, but still tasty and I didn't want to wait for a refire. I learned there was fairly new staff on board and that's such a small detail that it's forgiven. I know if I asked, they would have happily remade them! The Spicy Po' Boy was good and messy!! Their wing sauce is my favorite, I probably won't order that sandwich again, just too messy for me. I prefer their Bufalo wings anyway (eaten with a fork)! My standard order includes the wings, definitely what made me fall in love with Green. The Sangria was large, slightly dry, not uber sweet, and had peach slices! They have other cocktails beside wine and beer, but I wouldn't expect a full bar. However, the cooler full of non-alcoholic bevs holds quite the variety!   The Scottsdale location sells the tsoynami desserts inside, along with the full menu, while the Phoenix location shares a lot with Nami. Nami is the stand alone coffee shop where you'll find all the vegan desserts!   Great vegan fast food, there are healthy options, but who wants that when you can get a Big Wac?!   There's lots of indoor AND outdoor seating, the art lining the walls is local and can be purchased, it's counter service where they deliver to the table, booze, and desserts next door. Keep in mind that parking is limited and have patience with the parking lot, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"In addition to having fantastic food, the customer service here is SUPERB. Diane is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about veganism. The house chili is outstanding, as are the vegan buffalo wings. Regardless if you're vegan or not, anybody with a taste for quality food will love this place. Highly, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Ranchero Salad has been my go-to for years....can't get enough of those buffalo wings! Save room for a Tsyonomi!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Fast service!! Value priced? But not value taste;) Nice to come to full vegetarian (Vegan) restaurant that I can order anything off the menu!!! Had the Big Wac and crap puffs, my wife had the Alfredo and eggless rolls! All of it was really good, I am impressed!! Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that i am not a vegan, but would LOVE to be; hence, i have a really strong appreciation for all you veggie lovers out there and i try to eat like you as much as I can - but i do consume meat....so maybe my body just wasn't used to all this soy protein and that's why i had really bad indigestion after visiting Green.   Also, both of my friends didn't feel well after eating at Green either. All of us just felt so bloated and unwell after our meal. Is it normal for a carnivore to feel this way?   My husband got the Mexi-Cali burger. The \"meat\" didn't hold together and seemed like mush....which means the texture wasn't appetizing. The vegan cheese on that thing was NOT good.   I got the steak po-boy. It was really more like a philly cheesesteak without the cheese.   Our friend got the peanut curry noodles. He liked the first few bites.  We really, really, really wanted to like Green esp after all these rave reviews and for the veggie lover, i'm sure this place is heaven! But for us semi-carnivores, it just didn't sit well. I'm sorry, i wish my review could be better!"}
{"text":"Fuckkng amazing !!!! That big wac is the real mac ya dig"}
{"text":"I scrapped my original review and am leaving this one in its place. The first visit in late 2014 was a fairly large disappointment. We went back for a second try in March 2015, and it was soooooo much better. We had three or four different items (we were fairly hungry) and they were all outstanding. It was simply a matter of choosing the right items. So, stay away from the crab puffs, and you'll be totally fine.   Really looking forward to going back. (And with the next update, I'll make sure it's more timely, and we have the menu items so we can steer you in the right direction.)  Yet another update. We went to Green New American Veg again in October. It was even better than the last time. So, we are now at three great visits, and one mediocre one. I think it's becoming a better and better option every time we go."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I am transitioning and this meal makes me get right on the vegan boat! I got the Big Wak and it tastes better then most beef burgers. The food is fresh and fast. I can't wait to bring my skeptical daughter here so she can hop on the train with me."}
{"text":"Our friends end suggested this please and we all enjoyed a great lunch. The hot wings are OK, sauce was ok, not quite a buffalo taste I've had at other places. Still worth getting. We each had a bowl which were all tasty. Didn't care for the big broccoli stems, some weren't fully cooked. The desert was very good soy cream."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Just get the sandwiches and salads. You don't go to a place like this to order Asian food. You must try their Big Wac! Wow!! they make the vege-meat patties in house and it tastes like (better actually) than the real thing. Their Wendy pickle is excellent and the artichoke salad is so amazing! I'm not that impressed with their buffalo wings i was expecting something like what you would get at Veggie Grill, instead they are like buffalo bites.   Overall though, their sandwiches and their patented soy-nami's are better than McDonald's and Dairy queen.   I don't know how they do it."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I'm so happy I live so close by and I'm vegetarian!! The food is great make sure to try their vegan animal style fries!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat, as a vegan. Everything on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most amazing vegan restaurants I have ever been to. Many things on the menu sounded great but I decided on the Big WAC (vegan Big Mac). It was insanely delicious. The burger patties were great and it was topped with plenty of special sauce and vegan cheese. It came with a generous side of fries and ketchup. I had to try the vegan chili and it was amazing as well, I wish they sold this in grocery stores so I could eat it all the time. It had a perfect amount of flavor and it was the only vegan chili I've ever had that wasn't made with beans. I highly recommend this restaurant to plant based eaters and carnivores alike."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. I love the Big WAC burger!!! Great service, always friendly. Great selection of cold teas and I think I honestly drink about a gallon before I leave. I wish they opened one closer to me in Peoria (I think I would eat here daily)"}
{"text":"Ordered an order for pick up recently.  Was worried about being able to park etc, as it's limited, but found a spot right away... order was ready (We called right at 11 to order it which I think was key here- I've heard it can be slow during lunch.  Staff was super pleasant and WOW it was GOOOODDDD!  Green hummus with pita was awesome.  Had the Coconut curry with house tofu and it was awesome- perfect amount of 'sauce'- just coated not swimming- which my waistline appreciates.  Everyone's food in our party  was super.  Just under 10.00/person with tax- no drinks- but SOOO worth it."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location seems to be having quality control issues. My fries were completely soggy and limp. My Big Wac was missing lettuce, onions, and sauce-plus it was gleaming with extra grease. My friends salad dressing tasted exactly like feet. My other friend got her normal tofu bowl with peanut sauce-and didn't finish it. She said it \"tasted funky\" EPIC FAIL. Even the iced tea was different, it had very little flavor. Since Green is one of my favorite places, and this was my birthday meal, I was even more bitterly disappointed.  New cooks? FIRE THEM."}
{"text":"I love Green.  I love every thing about it. Especially the fact that I can order anything I want and not have to worry about ingredients. The meatball sub is bomb, the bowls are bomb, the limeade is bomb...  But the Wac burger...the Wac is the best thing I've put in my mouth since the pad thai at Loving Hut. OH MY STARS!  pair the Wac with the thyme fries and you have complete perfection. The people running the place are super nice, and this location even serves wine and beer.  The restaurant itself is very nice inside-sort of casual elegant.  I would highly recommend it for date night if it weren't so hard to hear your companion when inside.  They have a tiny back patio, and a larger front patio-so if you can score one of those tables-you'll really enjoy your meal.  They have a companion vegan bakery next door and that's where you get the soynamis instead of at Green--go next door too!  It should be 5 stars but it did take quite a while to get our meal, and it's really hard to hear inside.  Food is 5 stars though-NO QUESTION."}
{"text":"I live in Glendale and this place is in Scottsdale...so we def have to 'plan' to eat here.  The food is good, you can't even tell that it's not real meat.  I wish they had a location closer to Glendale."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Thank you for having such a great place with awesome employees and the most yummy food I've tasted since going vegan."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best vegetarian food I've tasted in the AZ. I hope they open up a place on the west side (Chandler) soon. I've had the Big Wac, Cauliflower crochets, roasted Brussels sprouts, PO boy sandwich just to name a few. The lines are always long, so I definitely call ahead. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Really delicious food that even my meat-eating friends like. Everything we have ordered is delicious: hummus, veggie burgers, chili cheese fries, salads. I love healthy vegan food, but their vegan versions of junk food are totally satisfying as well. And a lot healthier than the mainstream versions!"}
{"text":"I was just here a few weeks ago.  The place is decorated very urban/retro.  I love the car doors lining the south wall!   Service was super-friendly.  I would have given 5 stars except for one thing: THEY HAD NO VEGGIES THE DAY I WAS THERE!.  That's right!  I even said to our waitperson :How can a vegan restaurant have no vegetables??????   I got peanut noodles and it was still ver good, despite the lack of veggies. I will go back, though, fo sho'!"}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian cuisine.  Everything I have had is consistent and the beverages are delicious!  It gets busy at prime times but worth it!  Very reasonably priced for the quality of food!  Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for vegans and vegetarian, for well missed fast and comfort food. My friends who are not vegetarian enjoyed food here as well! However, food here is generally salty, and mostly fried which is not the healthiest food option out there. However, I really enjoyed the buffalo wing with barbecue sauce (you have to specifically ask for barbecue sauce, and this option is not listed on menu), and the artichoke chicken salad. I wasn't too impressed with asian dishes though, which is understandable since that's not really their specialty. I would go back again but probably only once in a while when I crave for less than healthy indulgence."}
{"text":"So, I must admit that when I walked into this restaurant I did not really know what I was doing. As a recently minted Vegan my friends have been telling me to try this place. Figuring from their name, they'd have vegan options or at least items you could modify to be vegan. Upon looking at the menu the \"Big Mac\" grabbed my attention. It mentioned that it was a vegan burger but had cheese. \"Why would they do this?\" I asked my friend. \"Why would they put cheese on a Vegan burger and make it un-vegan? Why even bother making the burger vegan then?\" I queried. She then pointed to a section on the menu that described the restaurant. Much to my surprise, Green is a 100% vegan restaurant!  Now, I didn't know what to get because everything sounded good, being Vegan. The waitress suggested we get the special they were offering that night, which they were doing for NYE 2013. The special included hot & sour soup, \"egg\" rolls, vegan crab puffs, BBQ \"chicken\" skewers, some baby bok choy, and some sort of vegan duck dish. I have never had duck so I have no basis for comparison. I must say, everything was absolutely delicious! The vegan crab puffs...I can't get over how good those were.  They also have really unique drinks and they do offer beer and wine.   I will definitely be back to this restaurant or their Tempe location."}
{"text":"Green is A-OK with THIS meat-a-tarian.  First, let me tell you I'm not a vegetarian. I like bacon way too much and I have a hard time even liking vegetables. I went today for a going away lunch with a co-worker and so surprised at just how good Green was!  I admit, I was totally trash talking the mock-chicken before I had it. It just sounded weird. Pssshaw....\"mock\" chicken.   I'm just super excited about the fact that most of the bowls are gluten free except the Thai peanut. I got the coconut curry \"chicken\" and boy, was it tasty! They make it with tamari sauce instead of soy sauce, hence the gluten free-ness of the dish.  If I wasn't so full from the artichoke dip I would have devoured a soynami (vegan blizzard). They don't have any gluten ingredients in them either, except for whatever toppings you might toss in. It's pretty rare that I can go to a restaurant and eat 80% of the menu. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Best vegan comfort food imaginable! Their food is always tasty but I couldn't handle it every day. The no-harm-parm sandwich is my favorite with their curry pasta salad. So good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for vegan comfort food! Love the new menu and creative specials."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing the tasty, Green!   Parking is kind of crazy, but totally worth the hassle! It's a quaint cute little spot and has a super cute patio! The girls working there that took our order were super polite and helpful.  They offer lots of different varieties - YAY!! (It's hard to come across good vegan places with variety like this, so that itself is refreshing!) Anyway, I ordered the Diablo Red bowl with tofu which was absolutely delicious and SO much food! They also serve local craft beer (Four Peaks), which is always a plus in my book! I'd say the prices were pretty normal for a place like this.. Expect to pay $7 - $10 per plate.  I definitely recommend this place and will be going back!"}
{"text":"As card-carrying omnivore, I sometimes like to take a break from meat and play for the other team. I have never eaten at the Green original in Scottsdale. This place is so close to my work that I was able try it. The first time, I had their buffalo wings and an apricot noodle dish. Their take on ranch dressing with cucumber is a to-die-for concoction. What I wouldn't give to be swimming in that. Soooo good. They need to bottle that. NOW. The buffalo wings really tasted like what you'd get in a sports bar but they were a little salty for my taste. Another time I had the vegetarian chili fries. Very authentic tasting also. The faux-cheese was meh. But it went well with the fries. Another winner is their green chile hummus with the fried pita chips. I would love to work my way through the whole menu. I also like the decor of woods and recycled materials. So far, I haven't found much to complain about. If you're going to pick up to-go, definitely call ahead first. Also, parking can be tight; you may have to risk parking at Coco's. Still, I'm all for going 'green'!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm not even Vegan. Though, after eating at GREEN, I'm seriously considering Vegetarianism.  Problem is: I'm a creature of habit. When I find a meal I like, I just reorder it over and over. (note to self: change that!)  My meal of choice at Green is the Mongolian Noodle Bowl w/the mock chicken, which is to die for. The veggies are fresh & flavorful and the mock chicken is absolutely delicious.   Equally as satisfying is the Soynami, frozen vegan ice \"cream\" delight and the Peanut butter thingy.  I do wish they had more drink choices.   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd like to see them use whole wheat noodles and Organic. But really, that's minor. Cause like the other review mentions, their other restaurant \"That's a Wrap\" in Phoenix has healthier fare.  For the conscientious greenie, GREEN lives up to their name in more ways than one! The floors are concrete, the tables are made from sustainable materials (is that sorghum?) and they are definitely saving energy with what appears to be a swamp cooler. Not overly cooling on a hot Arizona afternoon but energy efficient.  Green is hands down my favorite Arizona restaurant and I've been here for 8 years. Arizona definitely needs more of these type restaurants.  The downside? They're about 40 or more miles away from my home. But with the food quality, relaxed atmosphere and Green interior, it's worth the trek for me."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Green last December when they catered a Lucky Dog Rescue silent auction. I can still remember my first encounter - the buffalo wings and dipping sauce. I thought I heard someone mention that it was vegan. No, there's no way a chicken wing could be vegan. But then I heard it again- everything is vegan. You might say that I loaded up on those little buffalo wings, but who could blame me! There's a reason they've won awards... they're amazing! Next, I tried the mock chicken skewers that were smothered in green's original espresso barbecue sauce. I have to say that Green has really nailed the mock meat. The texture, flavor and taste are so authentic that sometimes I find myself second guessing the mock in the meat.  It's no surprise that off of their regular menu, my favorites are the buffalo chicken sandwich and the barbecue chicken sandwich. I also order a plate of the buffalo wings as an appetizer every time I stop in. Their pasta bowls are also really good, and their mock meatballs are pretty delicious. My only less than stellar experience at Green was when I ordered the Mexi-Cali burger. I'm not sure what the patty was made of, but it was red, and I wasn't really into the flavor. But the thyme shoe string fries rescued the meal and my tummy.  The lemon-aide and lime-aide are also delicious, and I would recommend giving them a shot if you're generally a cola-junkie.  One last tip would be to get there early on Saturday nights as they get pretty busy and you might be hard pressed to find an open table."}
{"text":"I've recently found this hidden gem,and it's amazing! It's nice to just order off the menu without trying to make sure things are vegan friendly.& the coconut ice cream is TASTY!!!! I've been to both locations and the Tempe one is slightly less packed. Don't worry though it's worth the wait and the prices are super reasonable"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was the worst I have experienced. It was very busy but after waiting a good 20 minutes we had to ask for our table to be wiped down as it had food remnants still on it from the previous diners. The food came out in stages with the last meal coming 50minutes after everyone else's food had arrived. Had we not had to pre-pay, we would have left. Asked to speak to the manager who was less than thrilled at hearing some criticism (hey - I get it - it's busy as heck and the service industry is not an easy one to work in - but at least act like you care.) In an annoyed tone she asked me if a gift certificate to the bakery next door would \"make it all better?\"  With all the money they're making on those delicious vegan burgers and with the place packed you'd think they would hire more staff to accommodate! That would actually \"make it all better.\""}
{"text":"Wow I love this place, tried it out since I was hungry and in the area.  The Big WAC was so amazing, the tea hit the spot. It was nice to get a little \"less healthy\" meal since I usually eat most fruits and veggies. I will be sure to let others know how awesome this place was."}
{"text":"I've eaten a huge percentage of the food on Green's menu and I love it all. If nothing else, come here to try the Soynami's (vegan Blizzards). I'm not a fan of rice or soy ice cream but this stuff is amazingly good.  The bowl meals are packed with great fresh vegetables. I mostly eat whole foods and don't consider the fake meats to be especially healthful, but I love to eat the fake meat here once in a while for the texture. It's so good. It's not exactly like the real thing, but it doesn't need to be. It's delicious as it is.   There is always a huge variety of people eating here all the time. It's always packed, always hard to get a table. Good for Green Restaurant!  Atmosphere: The restaurant is made with green materials. Every time we go they are showing the work of a different artist. It's college-indie and casual.  The employees don't act super enthusiastic, but they're decent and polite and do a good job. I love the humor of whoever it is that writes up the food specials on the chalkboard.   BTW, you can get vegan whipped cream here and it's SO GOOD!   :)"}
{"text":"Green is vegan junk food. Very fun and delicious, but not incredibly healthy. If you are more health conscious, you can get a bowl of steamed veggies in various sauces from the bowls section of their menu. They do offer an organic tofu option if you are concerned about GMOs. Just ask for the \"fresh\" tofu. If you are not worried about health, everything here is delicious. The chicken wings are great. Not very chicken-wing-like; more like like little soy nuggets drowning in spicy sauce with a side of ranch. Super yummy. The artichoke gratine is amazing, also spicy. The chili fries are just ok IMO; their ranch is amazing though. Next time I would just get the fries with ranch to dip them in. Seriously the best vegan ranch I've ever tasted. I could go on and on because I ate practically everything while I was here. It's all good, you guys. I love that their water is room temperature. The people who work here are super friendly and helpful. The restrooms are great. You may be tempted to sit on the front or back patio in the evening because the weather is nice and they keep it pretty cold inside, but being eaten alive by mosquitoes is not worth it. Bring a sweater and brave the A/C."}
{"text":"I love to go to Green! They're a bit pricey, so It's not something I eat often, but it's a great treat for those times that I'm craving that comfort food that's harder to score as a vegan.   What's even greater about this place is that the food is SO good that even non-vegans eat there. My meat-eating husband often craves their buffalo \"wings\".   I highly recommend the buffalo wings or the Big Wac (which is Green's take on the McDonalds' Big Mac.   The people who work there are also great. They've always been very polite and the service is fairly quick and always friendly. I heard somewhere that the head chef and creator of the Green menu even won some culinary award. I'm not sure if that's true, but it wouldn't be hard to believe based on the taste!   If you're a vegan looking for some hard to find comfort food, or if you're a meat-eater looking to either dabble in the vegan cuisine or need to take a vegan friend or significant other to lunch, I HIGHLY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable! Great for vegans and vegetarians. Even good for people who like meat as it's so tasty and has lots of fake meats."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Sunday morning and got brunch, and everything was SO GOOD! I got a breakfast burrito filled with tempeh, cheese, potatoes, eggs and other delicious goodness but also tried my friend's yogurt parfait and soft serve ice cream. Everything was completely vegan, but it honestly tasted better than any real meat burrito I've ever had. And the staff were wonderful and answered all of our newbie questions. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone, vegan or not. Can't wait to go back to try their vegan big mac!"}
{"text":"Food is always great! The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because they really need to work on their efficiency in handling guests and their long lines at lunch time! I typically order online or call in so that my food is ready for me to pick up when I get there. No matter if you order online or pay a heady, you still get stuck waiting in line for 10-15 minutes while they assist others ordering. Then I get to the front of the line only to tell them I ordered online and then be handed my food. It's frustrating when you order and pay ahead just to avoid this. They should have an area specifically for \"To-Go\" orders. Again, nothing against the food because it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ode to my little vegan haven...you are the sweet escape from the strife and angst of eating out almost everywhere else other than my kitchen, a delicious relief from the menus that more resemble checklists of things I cannot/choose not to eat. I can at last read \"chicken wings\" and actually order them, extra sauce. I can drool at the thought of a po' boy sandwhich, spinach and artichoke dip, or spicy singapore noodles. I can wear a baseball cap, order chili fries and kick it with the home team. I can introduce you to all my beloved carnivores and listen to the \"mmmmm\"s without any questions as to why I choose to eat the way I do. ** Sigh **"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place! This is my first time really at an actual vegan place. I got the bff sandwich with fries. It was good but a little greasy for me. I haven't had food like this in a while-since before going vegan so I'm just not used to vegan food like this. I'm not really into heavy food like this all the time but when the feeling strikes I'll be back and try something else next time. Parking is tight too."}
{"text":"\"I couldn't help it. I can resist everything except temptation.\"   - Oscar Wilde  After consuming a small salad for lunch at home, Linh L. and I made the decision to try out Green's Tsoynamis around 3PM.  Being part of the 80% of Asians that are lactose-intolerant, I've been wanting to try out their decadent \"tsoft tserve\" soy-based ice cream.  A short car ride later, we sauntered into Green, the Garden of Eden, and were instantly tempted by the forbidden fruit in the form of a delicious aroma.  I was suddenly hungry and something warm was all too tempting.  \"Would you like to see our menu?\" asked the hipster-looking cashier.  Yes, Eve.  I would like to see the menu.  Also, I swear you were in the art program at ASU with Linh and me...  Weird.  Even though I really have been wanting to try Green's Tsoynamis since I first stumbled upon a picture of it on Instagram, I've been creeping on their online menu.  Naturally, I got the Thai Peanut with house tofu.  While it has great flavor and the sauce coats the broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and fried tofu well, it sadly didn't have a strong peanut sauce flavor.  I suppose I went into it hoping it will taste like Thailicious' peanut sauce salad dressing but that was my fault.  It was still delicious on the organic brown rice and I was full without feeling heavy and gross.  I love clean eats!  Linh had their special \"RocknRolled Tacos\" with Seitan chicken.  He liked it.  Although we were both full and satisfied from our impromptu late-lunch, we decided to splurge and get dessert.  TSOYNAMIS FOR DAYS!  My banana cream pie tsoynami was delicious.  Linh's Dough Boy was also pretty darn good.  It had giant chunks of cookie dough that made my skirt flip [not literally, unlike my time at Fired Pie].  I sat cross-legged in the booth merrily eating my lactose-free dessert while staring at the artwork, the car doors lining the wall, and all the artsy hipster customers and I was happy.  Outside the rain began to fall.  We came, we dined, and we gave in to the temptation that is Green.  Linh even left with a spumoni cupcake.  You guys are good.  You guys are real good.  \"When women go wrong, men go right after them.\"  - Mae West  I think Mae was talking about Green and me.  My wallet is feeling lighter and all is right with the world.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Green is probably the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to. And I've been to quite a few. Living in San Fransisco for two years gave me the experience of restaurant hopping.   When my friend asked me to go I was quite hesitant. I didn't believe that good vegetarian could be done outside of a food hub city. Boy was I wrong.  We had the vegan chili fries, the green burger and the ice cream. Every single item was amazing. I was basically licking the chili out of the bowl. And the soy ice cream was better then any Haagen Dazs I've ever had.   I wouldn't consider myself a vegan/vegetarian or even a person who is generally interested in that kind of food. But Green was completely worth going to, and I highly recommend it to anyone--vegetarian or otherwise!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Green a few other tries. I've been back for the Soynami's multiple times even. They are VERY good, almost unbelievable how they make them taste. They don't have that nasty nutty soy aftertaste that seriously makes me want to hurl.  I also tried the original spicy po boy. It's basically just a spicy mock chicken sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of the mock meats but I found it to be ok. I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad. Their fries are very delicious and soaked in a layer of grease, which is probably why they taste sooo good.  The staff is always nice and helpful. When I've asked them about gluten in some of their desserts, they're very knowledgeable and immediately know what does and doesn't, which is a nice surprise."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but my good friend (who was with me) is and has been for a long time, so we decided to check out Green New American Vegetarian (actually, it's Vegan).   I'm glad we did!  The place is super cool inside - definitely a trendy place with a lot of young people.  We got there just in time, before the lunch rush, because at about noon, the place was insanely packed!  The menu is pretty big, so there are a lot of choices for the true Vegans.  I ordered the green hummus dish to start - really good and spicy - but not too spicy. The pita chips are freshly made and have a nice spice on them, too.  I didn't get the pickle garnish... a little strange.  I had the small Green Salad - it was really super de-lish.  The dressing was also a little spicy, but it made it really great.  Tons of green olives - so, you better like olives (which I do).  My friend ordered the Argentine Po-Boy - she scarfed it down... she had the cole slaw side and said it was really yummy.  Keep in mind to get there early - the parking is big enough for about 10 cars (we were luck to get one of the last spots) and the place is small, but you'll love it!  Definitely worth trying - even if you're not a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan. I've never eaten at a vegan restaurant, nor could I (at least right now) choose to be vegan 100%. Yet if anyone was ever going to convince me to go vegan, it'd be Green.  The sweet potato tator tots were delicious, as was my huge salad filled with fresh greens and figs.   I'm not a fan of soy (unless it's edamame), so I was happy to hear this place offers alternatives to soy-based fake meats and cheeses.   The decor is rad. The place is eco-friendly too.  The staff is friendly and helpful.   Yep, this place is pretty damn amazing."}
{"text":"First visit wont be my last- loved the menu and the choices. Portions filling and healthy and very tasty! I want to try everything! Be sure to end your meal with a Banana Cream Pie Shake.  Only advice- open more locations!!"}
{"text":"this restaurant was amazing. they have a nice ambiance, and a wide variety of food and drink on their menu. we had a rice bowl with tofu, and the flavors were so spot on, the spice was delicious without being overpowering and the tofu was crisp and delicious. they also have a wonderful strawberry margarita that was really tasty.   would definitely come here again, i have no complaints."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. However, some people that work their don't really understand gluten free and were not really sure about options even though there is a \"gf\" marking on their menu. If you are very sensitive to gluten I would not recommend. They are more focused on no meat than no gluten. That is for sure. I got the mock chicken Thai peanut salad. It is listed on the menu as a wrap but just get it as a salad. It is seriously so good and now I crave it!! I was a little worried about the mock chicken not being gluten free and the girl who worked there said she thinks it's gluten free. It did not both my stomach at all so I'm going to say she was correct. I am also not as sensitive as others. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"If I didn't see it on here first, I never would've found this hidden gem tucked in a corner of a strip mall between a bike store and a Goodwill.  The menu seems like there are a lot of options but what they do really well are their bowls and their sandwiches. We had their Diablo Red bowl - a spicy veggie and rice creation we got with 'chicken,' and the pasta with 'meatballs.' We also split the 'wings.' They totally have their mock meats down. I was most surprised by the meatballs which were tender and flavorful with a near perfect texture. Their bowl sizing is perfect, I could eat more but that's probably about as much as I should have.   The next time we had the 'green burger,' a house-made veggie burger with oats that's actually red in color. It inspired me to start Googling around for how to make something similar because it was such a fresh take on a veggie burger. He had another bowl- the curry with 'chicken' which was fantastic.   This is the best overall vegan place I've tried in a long while, it nails the balance between creative and attainable where all feel welcome.    I hope they eventually slide into a more cozy atmosphere. It's not awful, but I can't see its dinner business growing in its current location."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Green.  I only came here because the people I worked with on a recent program had ridiculous food restrictions of the vegan variety.  I try to just cover my ears and not listen to them when they talk, because it's like listening to bubble boy.  Have we rebelled against our very nature?  Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The \"mock\" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.    They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.    I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.  5 Stars"}
{"text":"Came here my parents and we all enjoyed it. It was hard to tell that it was actually not meat, because the recipes are so unique. It also it a quaint place to dine in during the day although limited in seating because of how popular it is for lunch there apparently... Am curious to go back and try a different dish soon."}
{"text":"Yes please!  The food is great.  The only reason for the 4 vs 5 star is due to service.  When you place your order it's a bit disorganized and takes a.w.h.i.l.e.  Save room for the Tsoynami!"}
{"text":"Yum! Loved it! Veggie restaurants always run the risk being... boring? Not the case with Green. Stopped in for lunch with some friends and I was not disappointed.  There's a small parking lot shared with Nami. You can also park around the perimeter of the building in different marked spots. The restaurant is modern and simple and comfortable.  Lots of different wines and beers available, and I would have loved to have one, but I opted for one of many different healthy flavored water drinks in the fridge by the counter. I had the Thai peanut bowl with house tofu and noodles. Sauce was spicy and delish; noodles were cooked well, and there were nice big pieces of fresh broccoli and carrots alongside perfectly done tofu. It was filling and yummy, and I did not feel depressed (from grease and calories) after eating it.  The big wac really does taste like a big mac. It looks beautiful - the way you'd hope a big mac would look, and it tastes awesome. Calexico burger was pretty good. Cole slaw is really fresh, really good, and the fries are amazing. I could eat the fries all day, every day.  I will be back! Even if you're not huge on veggie only food, this place is worth a try. If you like tofu, definitely stop in. Faux meats taste really close to real meat so again, give it a go!"}
{"text":"I really, really love Green. It is one of my favorite vegan/vegetarian places in the valley. I truly wish they would open a 3rd restaurant in Paradise Valley or N. Scottsdale because never have I been disappointed with ANYTHING I've eaten here.  The animal fries are smothered in cheese, onions, thousand island sauce and are sinfully delicious and worth every calorie.  The crab puffs are to die for and taste just like actual crab meat.  The eggless rolls are insanely good.  Thai peanut bowl is yumtastic.  The imitation \"Big Mac\" (called a big WAC) is my absolute favorite veggie burger OF ALL TIME.  However, I will say that while I enjoy the thyme fries ok, there should be an option for just PLAIN French fries and it'd be nice if they offered sweet potato fries as well.  Still love this place and I never neglect to head over to Nami for a delish sweet vegan treat after dining here!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try."}
{"text":"Yum! For all those skeptics who fear trying vegan cuisine, this is the place to start. I have not had anything on the menu that I disliked, and you would never know that these dishes are completely free of animal products. The Green Burger and the Mexicali Burger totally satisfy my need to chomp into a big ol' burger, which I occasionally miss since I became a vegetarian. The Drunken Mushroom \"Chicken\" Bowl is amazing. All of the vegan \"meats\" and \"cheeses\" they use at Green are awesome. They even sell some of them in their mini grocery store so you can take that vegan deliciousness home with you. And the desserts... oh, boy! If you haven't tried it already, go now!"}
{"text":"Ooops...I haven't reviewed Green yet. No bother, if you're reading this you're already curious about the place, and should stop in already.  This place is Mecca for Vegetarians in the East Valley, as vegetarian spots/options are hard to come by out there.   Their mock \"meat\" is especially great... with just the right texture, perfectly absorbing the sauce or spices it accompanies.  My favorites:  Spicy Mock Chicken Salad - Filling, spicy, fresh The Samosas - Sweet/tangy flakey Balsamic Picnic Salad - Berries berries berries! Tsoynamis - You MUST Get one...get one...just do it.  Now, the carnivores I've taken here are especially fond of the mock-meat bowls.  So...anyone you take here should come away satisfied.  They also have Brunch on Sundays with awesome vegetarian options like, a long missed favorite of mine: Eggs Benedict.  Thank you Mr. Damon Brasch."}
{"text":"Freaking love This place!!!!! Been here 5-6 times over the last few years and it never disappoints. Love the buffalo wings, big wac, soynamis, donuts, breakfast burritos... like I said, never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"everything is very good. i always enjoy coming here. soynami's are super delicious as well."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and service we received at this restaurant. Loved everything about it- the wings are delicious and everything is vegan. I will be back and recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"I'm def not a vegetarian but I decided to give Green a-go when my co worker (veggie head) wanted to grab some lunch. She had been here once before with less than desirable food, but figured she'd give it one more shot.  Well, no more shots for Green are in our future...  We ordered at the desk and our food came out within 15 minutes. No big deal there. My friend ordered the artichoke dip that was served with chips and hummus that was served  with deep fried pita chips, and I ordered the Kung Pao \"Chicken\".   If you didn't tell me there was artichokes in the dip, I would have never known. It was more of an enchilada sauce/bean dip weird mess. Not horrible on the pallet, but def not what we expected was ordered. The Hummus was spicy and came with a pickle (??) on the side. Pita crisps were way too deep fried for their own good. Needless to say... we did not ask for a to-go box.   The Kung Pao chicken wasn't bad per-say, but my \"Chicken\" was very stringy and foamy to the texture. Yes, I said I wasn't a veggie head, but I have had Morning Star \"chicken\" before and it's 10 times better than what  came in my bowl.  I get veggie heads love this spot because they don't have to narrow down the menu to 2 items, but me thinks not."}
{"text":"It's nice to have place solely focused on the vegan in humanity. Atmosphere in this place is mellow, and minimalistic, with thought provoking, psuedo intellectual, writings on the walls.  this place has a great selection of food, especially when it comes to meat imitation.  Unfotunately all the meat imitation is soy based, and therefore hard on the stomach and digestive system. I once had a Po' Boy Chx Sandwich that stayed with me for 12 hours before deciding we didn't get along. Everything else here is great, the ice cream, salads, fresh made lime-and-lemonade. just stay away from the Soy heavy product."}
{"text":"I recently became a vegetarian, and this place is probably by far the best, tastiest restaurant ever. First time I was introduced to Mock Chicken, when I got my BFF chicken sandwich I was a little hesitant because the chicken looked so real. It was crazy. What's even crazier is... How amazing and delicious it is. I almost felt like I was cheating. Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian this place is amazing, the food the environment is so hipster and cute. I went in on a Friday afternoon and since it was my first time I didn't realize how many others have found out about his place, I waited in line for a while but didn't mind because the atmosphere is so cute and everyone around was so happy and nice. I can't wait to come back and I have been telling everyone I know about how great the food is here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!!! The buffalo wings are addictive and yes possibly not the healthiest thing on the menu but dang they are tasty! I will say the wait is crazy when they get busy and it's annoying having to wait for people to get up so you can sit down.... We were nice to offer part of our table to another couple that was looking for a seat, but I guess our table was tiny. Luckily it planted a seed and another couple offered them a place at their table that was bigger.   Besides the seating and the wait for the food, there was so much that we wanted to try! The spicy edamame was great! I ordered the Curry noodles, they were nice and a great portion! My boyfriend ordered the fake CHicken Parm Sandwich... he liked it and had no complaints. I would highly recommend that you try the fake buffalo wings, they were so damn tasty that we tried to venture back to get another fix before we headed to airport, sadly they were closed ! :("}
{"text":"Absolutely love the buffalo wings here! They are a must! Love the big mac its sooooo good! Ordered the curry bowl also and we had so much food that we had to save it and finish the rest of it for the next day, but it was awesome because we wanted to go back for more buffalo wings and realized that they wouldn't be open till later on and our plane was leaving. If your a vegetarian or vegan or even a meat eater.. I promise this place will not disappoint! Its mad awesome delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is so ridiculously overrated. It's the only time Yelp reviews for a restaurant have misguided me.  The problem isn't that the food is bad (it's decent)... it's that the food is comically expensive for what it is. My wife and I paid $50 for our meal, which consisted of two basic stir fry's, a tiny portion of vegan chicken wings, and two bottled teas... from a restaurant where you order at a counter and find your own seat. If it was literally half the price this would be a 3-4 star review.   I actually got buyers remorse from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I totally loved the lunch I had there.  As a traditional omnivore, I put them through a hard test for a vegan place to pass: hamburger, fries, and milkshake.   It was awesome. They passed with flying colors, and I would totally eat there again.  Maybe tomorrow, in fact...."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Been a frequent customer since becoming vegetarian. This is by far the best vegetarian place I've been to.  So glad they have another location in central phoenix.  I often go for the Big Wac (its like a vegetarian version of the Big Mac). Probably similar in calories too but it's meat free! The curry dish is also good. I love that they serve fruit as a side option. Overall, you can't go wrong with most of the stuff on the menu. I prefer the mock beef over the mock chicken, I've found its a bit more tender. Still, 5 stars from me! My only wish is that they were open a bit later!"}
{"text":"Let me say my peace to the Mock BBQ Chicken:  What yum wizardry was this? Medallions of mock chicken stuff so superly slathered in delicious espresso BBQ sauce. Accompanied, of course, by flourishings of sauteed onion slices and red pepper magic.   Face, marauded with tasty sauce. Mouth, accosted with the deep and boisterous flavors, the tantalizing textures of this feast.  And the side, the joy of the coleslaw? The cold crunching cabbage of fine and seasoned tahini company? Scrumptious with honors.   The lost tummies of yore are gnashing their teethy parts, they're wailing and weeping at the heavens for not having been born in times as these; these moments where one could get the secret BBQ chicken sandwich at Green. Oh, dear eater, hast thou had such an explosive endeavor upon your tasty tongue buds? Have you dined upon such sorcery as is this so noble of sandwiches?   I say nay, I say too that you must. These are the songs of my taste buds and to these songs you should harken and heed. Have.... the Secret BBQ chicken sandwich  The sweet limeade is yumy too!"}
{"text":"Here is the equation for this review:   +5 stars for Tsoynamis:: So appropriately named: These things seriously pack the gale-force taste to knock your tongue-hut off of its timbers. Fun hand-mixed flavours to choose (Rocky Road -choc chips, choc syrup, walnuts, marshmallow...PB&J -peanut butter, grahams, strawberries...Almond Joy, S'mores, Don Quixote, and a Choco-Coffee Creation) or build your own...all with a base of their fantastic soft serve -*vegan* soft serve. True. These things are about 16oz...and a little natural disaster in a glass, so I recommend sharing if you are not plan to make it your meal. 3 words: Tsoynami for breakfast.   -2 stars for pizza and sandwiches:: These were just dissapointing. The Texas po'boy with portabello in their Espresso BBQ sauce sounded unique and delicious, but it was really a let down. The BBQ sauce was altogether too sweet. The peppers were sauteed to a point of sadness, and they just contributed even MORE sweetness to the dish. Really missed the BBQ mark (I am a 'que sauce executive, by the by). The hot-wing po'boy, however, seemed to have stolen ALL of the flavour and spice from the Texas. *Very* hot (I enjoy heat, so it was fine for me, but I caution more sensitive buds), and too greasy for my taste.  But the pizza was the BIG misfire. I had heard good things about the type of vegan cheese they use, so I definitely wanted to try that while we were in town. My mistake. I just have to face it. I am NOT into the melty-cheese thing (all of you dairy-dos are rolling your eyes...yes, I get it, the big 'duh' for the vegan girl). Horrible texture, taste and ALL too much of it. (Omni-mum agreed). Even scraping it off, the taste lingered. The sauce was nice, but the mushrooms and onions, again, were too oily, and the veggeroni was just store-bought yuck. (I was hoping for some home-made-less-processed seitan or something). The crust was just a thin flat-bread, which I do not like for pizza. The sauce was tasty...but too thinly spread (and affected by the yuck cheese).   +1 star for free fresh fruit substitute:: Seriously, how many times do you have to give a kidney in order to get some fruit or veggies subbed for a side? Thank you, Green, for being reasonable.  So, do the math and you have 4 stars. Seriously, the Tsoynamis did all of the work on that one. I am tempted to advise Green to just shut down the food side and roll out the Tsoynamis non-stop. However, my mum really liked the fries.   Next time we are in Phoenix, we will definitely go to Green again, but only for Tsoynamis...and maybe fries. I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"I am really surprised at how good the food is at Green. Considering I'm not a vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination I can't believe that I actually really liked it. I got the Kung Pao noodle bowl with mock chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was spicy and flavorful. The veggies were fresh tasting and not overcooked. And I couldn't believe how tasty the \"chicken\" was! I don't know what's it's made out of but it really did taste like chicken.  They were super busy at lunch but they kept things organized and brought the food out pretty fast. I also liked all the healthy beverage options. I would definitely eat here again and any time I am asked for a vegetarian restaurant recommendation this is what I will say is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken wings are tremendous. the crab ragoons really could have been better  the buffalo chicken po-boy and thee Argentinean po-boy we had the next morning and were very good cold though we recognized that warm they would have been absolutely delicious.  (see my reviews of the other green location and nami for more about the menu!)"}
{"text":"I kinda expected the drunken mushroom chicken bowl to have broth in it because of the title? upon further review i realized my mistake. It was just better than okay for me (the vegan chicken was yummy but the rest lacked the flavor i was craving.) the meatball po-boy was quite good (as were the fries)  (see my reviews of the other green location and nami for more about the menu)"}
{"text":"Lunch and dessert! Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The staff is friendly, the food is amazing, it's not generally over crowded, and a great place to eat NO MATTER what your diet. Everyone loves this place. Seriously. Everyone.  I don't like fake meat, but my meat-eating friends loooooooove the fake meat here! I've eaten the fake chicken one time, and I literally freaked out about it because it looked and tasted just like chicken. Not for me, but if that's what you're down for - you won't be disappointed. I stick with the house tofu which is equally as amazing."}
{"text":"I love their Wendy's sandwich and their ice creams.  Not the healthiest but fun to have once in a while!"}
{"text":"Went there today for first time. Great service, great selection, great prices. Suggest the Buffalo Wings & the  Spicy Peanut Sauce with Tofu.  Wish there was one of these in the E. Valley. Great for anyone looking for a lite-healthy meal. We also got their ice cream. Definitely suggest trying! I've also heard the side of thyme fries is worth checking out. Strip mall that it is located in was a little hard to find. North of McKellips, right next door to The Salvation Army Thrift Store."}

It is the glorious Big Wac (with extra Wac sauce).    I have made the pilgrimage to both Green locations for several years now, and the Big Wac is always amazing and still has yet to be beat.    And for you McDonald's lovers, my friend says this burger tastes like a real Big Mac (I've never had one in my life, so I can't confirm).  So just try it.

And if you're flying to Chicago from Arizona, please bring one back for me!!!"}
{"text":"I never knew how exceptionally good vegetarian food could be until I had it here.  They truly knocked it out of the park, for me.  One key trait that separates a great restaurant from an average one is whether they are consistent.  And my dining experience here demonstrated that.  I've swung by here for lunch and brunch on separate occasions.  During my first time, I took a stab in the dark and went for their Thai Noodles with \"Chicken.\"  Boy, did I order right.  The noodles were perfectly cooked al dente! The \"chicken\" had great texture and taste.  The veggies were cooked firmly and evenly.  The freshness of all the ingredients made the biggest difference!  The sauce that glazed all over was on point! Everything was balanced nicely.    As for brunch, the fiancee had their \"eggs\" Benedict and I had the breakfast burrito.  The Benedict was just okay, we thought.  The \"ham\" that came in it was on the rubbery side.  The burrito was definitely much better.  What stood out from both dishes was the \"egg.\" Although it didn't quite taste like an ordinary egg, it certainly appeared like one given the texture and color.  The tortilla tasted non-gluten while the potatoes and \"sausage\" were cooked nicely.    I wish I lived closer as I would frequent more often.  I certainly hope they expand.  This is truly a hidden gem in my book.  7th St. & McDowell Rd is not known for being a food area but a trip here is definitely worth it.  Parking can be challenging, so if you can't find one, go into the neighborhoods on the south side and park on the dirt lot (you can't miss it) or by the curb.  It is minutes away from Downtown and the I-10 freeway."}
{"text":"I had the \"chicken\" curry rice bowl for a Saturday lunch. It was ok and definitely tasted best hot and fresh.  It wasn't nearly as good when I got home. I should've taken the cashier's advice and tried the wings or the Big Mac. The restaurant was pretty busy but the service was still great. I'll definitely go back but I don't recommend ordering the curry. This place is great for someone new to vegan/vegetarian foods!"}
{"text":"A boy named Bacon gives Green his seal of approval.  Yes. It's true. This happy carnivore enjoyed eating an animal-free meal yesterday. And I plan to return to sample more of there menu offerings. Terry T and I had our second meal of our bike ride here. She ordered the chili cheese fries and I ordered the Buffalo chicken and Samosas. Terry's fries were wonderful, and the chili was surprisingly spot on for the real meat deal. While I found the chicken to be overly salty (something Terry mentioned to me before ordering) the cucumber dipping sauce was good enough to drink. My Samosas were a terrific blend of sweet and savory.  The only thing that really had me scratching my head was the scales in the restroom. Huh? I weighed myself before eating, just for a goof."}
{"text":"Food is good, but honestly, everyone I've encountered working there seems so moody. Just kind of kills the vibe."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan (my husband is though), but their food is delicious and flavorful and a nice change of pace.  It can be a bit pricey, but I've discovered that if my husband and I each get a bowl and cups of lemonade we can keep it to about $20, which makes it much more wallet friendly for an impromptu weeknight dinner out.  Their curry bowl with fried tofu and noodles is one of my favorites, it's spicy, flavorful and piping hot.  Also their buffalo 'chicken' wings are fantastic, and very 'meaty' and spicy!   Tip: Avoid the pre-bottled sodas and drinks in the case, they are SILLY expensive.  Just get one of the cups for an in-house beverage (tea, lemonade, etc.) from the dispenser on the counter, they are very yummy and refillable."}
{"text":"3rd time visiting from Boston. Could potentially relocate just to eat here.  A vegetarian's dream.  Perfect menu. And all the diners are uber-fit (well, perhaps, except for me:)"}
{"text":"Never been to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, never had a veggie burger, about as new as I could be to the scene. The person taking the orders was very nice, patient, and friendly. I had a cider that was definitely not the best, but I ordered the big wac for my meal and it was ORGASMIC. If it was closer, I would be here every day!  While I was there, there was consistently plenty of seating. The staff were all very attentive as well. Great first experience at a restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome everyone was so sweet to us . On top of that the food was ready and served in under 20 minutes that was seriously the best part until I took a bite of my cheesesteak wow so yummy I'm still in complete shock how everything was vegan  and so spot on with taste and texture def coming back to Arizona for more .im lactose and I finally got a chance to eat animal fries such an amazing taste"}
{"text":"I was brought here by my team at work and was truthfully afraid I'd starve (I'm not a vegetarian). The environment was fun and inviting and I ordered the \"Big Wac\" and would you know, it was much better than the Big Mac! Five stars because this place is truly awesome!  Caution on parking, though, there's not much of it and a lot of people don't seem to know how to negotiate the lot."}
{"text":"WOW! What a find! We just went vegan a month ago and this place was a phenomenal find - it gave my husband the will to survive :) vegan 'junkfood' - everything you can imagine in vegan format. There's no deprivation in sight here!  We had the Mongolian bowl, vegan chilli cheese fries, Texas poboy, BBQ chicken sandwich and mint Choc chip tsoynami for dessert. Amazing food, tasted like the 'real' thing, only this IS the real thing - real food. Wow!"}
{"text":"Green keeps their vegan comfort food simple, and I'm going to do the same.  When I hear \"Green,\" I think: Best crab puffs ever, bar none.  Flavorful, filling vegan sandwiches, made only more comforting the vegan mayo.  Crispy thyme fries.  Fragrant, spicy Asian-inspired bowls with the most terrifyingly authentic mock meat I've ever tasted.  Overwhelming variety of unique, delicious drinks.  Does it cost a couple bucks more than your average hero or Chinese take-out?  Sure.    Is it worth it?  Oh, yes.   (This doesn't fit in anywhere, but: the decor is also super sweet, and there's a blonde waitress there who is my Style Idol...)"}
{"text":"I've ordered here from twice for lunch being both of my boss' are huge fans! The soynami (vegan version of a blizzard) is absolutely amazing! It ruined my life becuase I think I may be addicted. I got it with the crunch (vegan version of butterfinger) and chocolate chips. Sooooo good!  The last time I order the spicy peanut tofu sald. It was definitely yummy but could stand for a bit more veggies in the salad itself.  This should be a national landmark for vegans!"}
{"text":"My last couple experiences at this location of Green have not been so great.  On my most recent visit, my friend and I both ordered Drunken Mushroom bowls with chicken.  My daughter ordered something off their new kids' menu.  When our bowls arrived, neither one of them had any mushrooms!  What the...?!  Also, my daughter's food came way after ours arrived.      When a manager came out because our bowls were made incorrectly, he did not apologize.  He just said he didn't know how it happened and he'd make sure they were made right.  We waited an awfully long time for the mushrooms to be added to the bowls.  And, while I did not expect anything as a comp for our inconvenience, we did not get anything comped.  We also asked if they had any bowls that were not made with sugar in the sauce due to my friend being a diabetic.  They told us they had NO sauces or marinades that did not contain sugar.  Wow.  I knew Green was like fast food for Vegans, but there should be SOMETHING without added sugar.  Perhaps a simple soy and garlic marinade?  Since they had to remake our bowls anyway, my friend just got vegetables without any sauce added.    While I still do love the Green New American Vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix, this location just does not have the customer service or the attention to detail that the other location has.    Sadly, I don't make it to this part of town enough to warrant a return visit after this last visit."}
{"text":"After having visited the Tempe location, I was excited to try the restaurant downtown.  This space is so much more urban chic, with clean, open decor.  It is much more my style than the other location!  I arrived right as the restaurant opened, daughter in tow.  We quickly perused the menu and decided to order the hummus plate and the drunken mushroom chicken bowl.  We also ordered a couple fountain drinks and filled up with some organic berry lemonade.    We were served the hummus quickly by Chef Damon (though we did not introduce ourselves).  It was spicy and I loved it, but it had too much of a bite for my daughter.    The bowl came out quickly, and my daughter and I shared and devoured the entire bowl.    We chatted a bit with Chef Damon, who told us they were introducing a kids' menu in the next couple weeks.  It will have things like Mac N Cheese and Burgers.  I told him my kid loves the rice noodles, etc.  I really hope they offer kid sized portions of some of their milder flavored bowls.    Overall, I LOVE Green!  My daughter loved it, too.  She asked me if we can go there every week when we are downtown for her appointment.  That's even without making a trip to Nami, which we plan to do next week.  The employees at this location are on point and are very friendly and helpful.    My daughter loved the music and chose to dance a bit while the restaurant was still empty.  Hey - she wasn't bugging anyone!  Who can resist world music?!  Here's to continued growth and success of a fabulous restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that could turn a carnivore into a vegetarian.  I have always been very resistant to soy products and any form of faux meat.  It just always seemed so gross to me.  Due to a recent change in my lifestyle to be healthier, I have looked into healthier alternatives including what I used to turn my nose up at.  We saw a demonstration at Devoured by Chef Damon where he turned some of the weirdest ingredients (to me) into a beautiful yummy dish.  I had to see what else he had to offer.  First of all, the place is nothing like I expected.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something along the lines of True Food Kitchen.  Instead, it felt like a mess hall at some weird Liberal Arts school, and I say all that in a good way.  It's an order and pay at the counter then wait for your food at a table ordeal, which normally is fine by me.  Unfortunately the girl who had our food never bothered to call out the name we gave and instead walked around casually asking people who she thought might have ordered our dishes if it was theirs.  Finally she made her way to us after about five minutes.  That was annoying.  Forget about that though, because the food is good enough to make up for that little mishap.  (Other staff members seemed to call out names perfectly fine, just not that one.)  I ordered the Drunken Mushroom Chicken and grabbed an Oogave soda out of the cooler for my dinner.  The soda was great, and you can buy them at Sprouts, awesome.  The \"Chicken\" was expertly crafted with a texture almost identical to chicken and a taste just as close.  The breading around it was yummy, slightly crunchy, and a tiny bit sweet.  My bowl was packed full of delicious fresh veggies and loads of mushrooms.  There was also a generous helping of rice noodles buried in there too.  It was all fantastic, and I would eat it every night if I could.  i will most certainly be back to Green to try everything else on their menu.  Everything looks so good!  When it's actually good for you too, you just can't resist!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while in Phoenix for the day. After reading glowing reviews about the Big Wac, I just had to try one for myself.  My husband and I arrived around 6:30pm and the restaurant was pretty busy. Luckily the line at the counter moved quickly and we placed our order. Two Big Wacs, 2 orders of thyme fries, and \"wings\".   All of our food came out really quick. Wings first, followed by the burgers. The wings were great! Good flavor and the dilly ranch paired very well with them. The Big Wacs were great! A little too salty for my taste, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the burger and fries! My husband, a carnivore, was shocked at how much it tasted like the real deal. I've tried the famous vegan versions in other cities, but the Big Wac blows those out of the water!  While the service and food were both great, I feel the price was slightly too high. In my opinion, burgers should just come with a side of fries automatically.  Great restaurant that's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy peanut tofu, picnic salad and lemon pesto bowl with tofu, brown rice and vegetables and it was amazing!! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant had a great vibe to it! Highly recommend and not too expensive! Currently moving to Tempe so I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has the best vegan food in town. I cannot wait to try the entire menu. The parking sucks, but definitely worth the hassle. It is our go to place."}
{"text":"Overall, its not the healthiest vegan food but damn is it good. There are so many great items on the menu but 90% of the time I get a Big WAC and fries. My prediction: If you blindfolded an animal eater and they took a bite out of a big wac they wouldn't know it was not animal and would comment on how it was the best big mac they've ever had.  The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the ordering situation could really be improved. There is always a long line with usually only 1 register and that person has to man the phone as well. Also there are not menus before you get to the desk to order so that slows things down more as ppl are still deciding at the register. Lastly, a pick up spot for ppl who phoned in takeout orders is needed."}
{"text":"Green is AMAZING!!!!!  I absolutely love this place!  I go here a few times a month and I think I've tried everything on their menu.  All food there is vegan and they serve up amazing comfort food that resembles foods I ate growing up as a full on carnivore, but now I can enjoy them as a vegan too.  The wings are amazing and I usually get them every time as a side dish.  They have awesome sandwiches, rice or noodle bowls, salads.  They are the only place I know that serves up crab puffs that taste like I remember, only meat and dairy free!  The Tsoynamis (basically a vegan version of the Dairy Queen blizzard) are absolutely amazing.  This restaurant is amazing for vegans, gluten-free vegans, vegetarians, omnivores... everyone!  Thank you GREEN for being there and working hard everyday to create amazing food!"}
{"text":"I'm loving this place. I hate that it is so far from where I stay they should open a location in the east valley. Tsoynami Cookies & Cream so yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm. In. Hea. Ven.  This food rocks. Of course, I am biased for a place that is compeletly dairy free. But, they really do know how to work those flavors. Now, I'm not typically big on the mock meat, (vegan food can be made well enough where you do not \"miss\" the meat in the dish, therefore, no need to replace it) However, I did like the texture of the mock stuff in the sandwhich I ordered. I had the \"mock chi-Ken parmesian sandwhich\" it tasted *exactly* like mozzarella sticks (or, at least, what I remember them tasting like from years ago....) which I happend to LOVE.....That sandwhich was sooooooo good, even the bread was perfect! I can't wait to try the other stuff on the menu....  Their tsoynamis are good too (tho, not as well made as the Nami location in Phoenix....my friend complained she only had one banana slice in her clunky monkey, where as at the other location it was FULL of banana) I had the Chai tirramasu (or something like that) it was DELISH! I think that is my new fave flavor (or it's a tie between that and clunky monkey)   So happy this is nearby, and that I don't have to drive all the way to phx to get my nami and green fix :)"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food! I heard someone once say it was junk food for vegans. But they have a delicious variety of sandwiches and salads that are healthy too! The buffalo wings are made from dehydrated mushrooms and they are amazing. I'm not vegan but I love this place"}
{"text":"Green is one of my favorite restaurants! I frequent this joint often because the food is fast and delicious. I am certainly not a vegan or a vegetarian but I do enjoy their food. My favorites here are the wings and the big wac.  The wings are an amazing texture and come with cucumber ranch that is very good. The big wac is messy but it taste very similar to the Big Mac without the guilt. I love their sweet potato tots and their French Fries as well. If you've never tried their vegan cookies or the soynamis at 'Nami' you must give them a try too. Everything is very reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I love taking out of towners here too!"}
{"text":"I went to Green to grab food the other day as a newly vegan eater. I got the peanut stir-fry dish with crispy tofu. The flavor was excellent and I REALLY enjoyed it. The ambiance at Green is amazing, and so are there teas and drinks. I also got a chocolate peanut butter bar and it was very tasty. I will definately be back to Green!"}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful food and yummy ice creams. Love this place! I'm not even vegetarian much less vegan, but I like mock chicken more than real chicken now thanks to you. I find myself craving a big wac every now and then and brunch is great too! So glad to have made your acquaintance :)"}
