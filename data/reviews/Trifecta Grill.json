{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. We were anticipating a bar and grill atmosphere and were stunned when we walked into what felt like a deli. A short menu hangs on the wall including burgers, wings, salads, and chicken strips. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was perfect for kids and families. While it wasn't what we expected, it was very good and our kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Had the wings a while back. They were okay, but I prefer nearby wing king. Also had a Greek salad & that was delicious. I heard it closed due to the owner falling ill and could not run it while he was out of commission."}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews for this place. Is it because the food is cheap? I went with a friend a few weeks ago and ordered chicken fingers. I didn't even finish half of my meal. I would have been happier going to McDonald's and ordering McNuggets. That's not a reflection on my taste... It's a reflection of the quality here. I thought it tasted like something from the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Update: I heard back from the owner twice not only letting me know he is aware of my situation, but recognized the customer service issues I brought to the table. I am pleased with his follow-up and will give the restaurant another try in the future I changed the rating from 1 star to 3 for now.



*************************************.


I ordered beef on weck with fries and cole slaw and wings through their online ordering process. order would not go through without entering a tip for the driver...problem is they don't deliver, but no problem I planned to pick it up. Total bill $18. I got to the restaurant 10 minutes after and waited another 5 minutes as they just received the online order...

Got home and found I was missing both sides I ordered, looked at the receipt and only one side was showing. Called and spoke to an employee who said to come back to get the missing side. I told her that it was not worth the drive back. She offered no other option or even an apology. 

I thought about the situation for a minute and called back and asked for a credit for the one missing side and the tip I had to leave since the service was non-existent. She said it would take a couple of weeks to process the credit. I asked to speak to the manager and was told the manager was not in. I asked for him to call me back when he got back. I never heard back.

The food items I did get was nothing special, a sandwich and 6 wings definitely not worth the prices charged."}
{"text":"My first love affair with the Beef on Weck took place at Lebowski's nearly 3 years ago. I take sandwiches very seriously, and this my friends, is a seriously good sandwich. Recently got the Beef on Weck at Trifecta, and it's just as delicious as it is over at Lebowski's. Also tried the buffalo wings for the first time and they were top notch: hot, fresh, and very tasty."}
{"text":"The beef on a weck is a poor representative of Buffalo NY. The roll was too soft and dry. The prime rib was replaced with Arbys style sliced beef. The fries, frozen, were greasy and tasteless. The au ju wasn't a side, it was necessary to get the imitation \"weck\" roll down.
I would drive by and not stop as this isn't even a one horse restaurant let alone a trifecta...
Zero stars!!!"}
{"text":"I had the fish and garlic fries I did enjoy both of them the fish is seasoned nice and is a pretty nice version of some fried fish. We had the wings (garlic parm) and I really liked the way that they cook the wing perfect crispy but not dry .. The place its self is kinda small we got there right at noon and beat the rush ..."}
{"text":"I've tried Trifecta twice as the first time I was very disappointed.  Portions were small, food was cold, menu hard to figure out even though it had a small selection.  For the price of what you get, it's not that great."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant that I will ever come back to. The food was poorly made, not a representation of the images on the menu. I spent the early portion of my morning and day attending to a very upset stomach after a few bites!"}
{"text":"Lebowski's Beef On Weck makes an appearance in South Charlotte/Indian Land...great roast beef and chicken fingers seem to be the winners on the menu...garlic fries and fried pickles also traveled from East Blvd to Highway 521...a tad different from East Blvd, a more \"Showmars\" style restaurant, order at the counter, and your meal is brought to your table...service was quick and attentive..any fan of any sandwich MUST try the Beef On Weck, one of the best dishes anywhere in town..."}
{"text":"Tried the beef tonight with \"garlic\" fries.  The beef really didn't have any flavor,  it was mainly just bland meat. I didn't get the Au Jus but I don't feel I should need that to enjoy the beef, which I didn't.  The \"garlic fries\" were not garlic,  they were just fries.  I don't know maybe they gave me sweet potato fries but even still they didn't taste like sweet potato fries.  So I don't know what the heck I got.  For $10 (combo) I would say I was very disappointed. I want to support local business but what I ordered doesn't really warrant a return.  There's a lot of great food around this area. ..better step up your game or end up like Donatos. Good luck with everything though,  I do wish the best for you so prove me wrong!"}
{"text":"Could be a high two star, but it was, truly, OK.  Recently opened in the former Donati's Pizza location in the first shopping center south of the NC border.  Look for it or you will zoom right by it.

Basically a limited sandwich shop with fish & chips, burgers, wings and chicken tenders.  We had the roast beef on their weck roll and it was good, but nothing to shout about...just a basic roast beef sandwich.  The weck roll had poppy seeds on it.  Au jus was extra and all you got was the sandwich.  Fries were an additional $.99.

One annoying thing about ordering is that I was repeatedly asked by three different people if I wanted my order \"to go\" or if I would \"eat in.\"  Once should be enough, but it further seemed that there was a division of labor: ordering, serving, busing, supervising  & preparation.  Normal food serving functions, but it reminded me of a union shop with just one person responsible for one area.

They do have \"combo it\" so check the menu, otherwise the add-ons truly can add up:  sauces and dips, chips, au jus, sides, drinks.  Try and bundle.

Beer and wine are served.

Worth a shot and you might find something that you like.  We will try it again...if it is convenient to us."}
{"text":"I am bumping this up to 4 stars based on the burgers.  I had one for the first time the other day and it was awesome.  I went back last night and it was just as good.  For the price and the quality, I will probably get these more than the beef on weck now."}
{"text":"I've tried Trifecta twice. Had Fish-n-chips once, and roast beef on the Weck roll today. Both good! Great lunch spot on a busy day. WiFi available. TV's...
Black-Jack rice is good (you add the seasoning). 
Very friendly service. Moderately priced.
Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Excellent wings, Beef on Weck, fish and chicken fingers! Haven't had the burger yet but I'm sure it's great as well. You really have to try the Beef on Weck - it's amazing. Don't question it, just order and enjoy! Excellent food, fast service and friendly people! Seriously, what more are you looking for?"}
{"text":"Yummy. The fish is well flavored. I like the garlic fries. It's pretty good in general. Make sure the cole slaw is fresh."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, which is fine. Wife got the fish & chips she said it was ok but a little bland. 

I went with the Beef On Weck, which I thought tasted great no complaints on that at all. 

We will have to go back to try the wings and looks like they are starting to serve beer and wine this week!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Trifecta Grill closed due to the health of the owner, Kirk Weaver. Kirk underwent a triple bypass recently and opted to close the restaurant. To concur with Brian F, this is a tough location for a restaurant. It is going to be replaced by Groucho's Deli."}
{"text":"Hey I still love the Beef on Weck but I've been here a few times now and there really isn't much here besides that sandwich, a burger, chicken fingers, and thank goodness the wings finally showed up here. Where are the Famous Lebowski Salads? A handful of greens and a protein isn't what I'm expecting from you. Wjhere's the Turkey Burger? I know you can't bring everything from the other location but you need some of the favorites. And the bag of chips a la carte with my Beef on Weck? Charge me more and put them on the side so I don't feel like it's a Wendy's or KC. I love Lebowski's, and I want to love this location too but you have to help me out a little."}
