{"text":"Cheap cheap food!!  It can get slow, but cheap and authentic!  Ordered a big family size Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef Chow Fun, Hong Kong Style Noodle, and extra rice and side of broccoli for just $25! Ate them with my family of 5, got bloated with leftovers! Real good deal."}
{"text":"Had the pork shumai and pork buns. The shumai was so good we decided to go back and order the shumai for catering. I ordered shumai party platter for 30.50+ plus tax around 6ish. The guy told me to be there at 7pm. I arrived at 6:58 pm and they told me it's going to be 15 minutes more as they started throwing it in their pot. Then the guy told me we're busy. Some advice from someone whos been in the service industry for awhile. Work on your service and and appearance. Don't have your family hang out in the front and clean the place up. Looks like a hurricane went through there."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here 5 times now, but this is the absolute last. Really good Chinese food, like this place is a hidden gem... but wow, incredibly HORRIBLE customer service. Whether I call the day before, 6 hours before or an hour before -- you will ALWAYS have to wait 30-45 minutes sitting here to get your food. In my last case, 2+ hours.  What set me off is I made sure to call at 12 noon to make an order for a party tray and asked for it to be ready for pick up at 5:30. I had to sit here for TWO HOURS for a pick up? What pissed me off is there was a guy waiting for the same order (who walked in after me by the way!) and he told me he called to make his order an hour ago... YET THEY GAVE HIM HIS TRAY FIRST. Mind you, we ordered the same thing. Just ridiculous. I even complained, they seriously didn't care. I called over five hours in advance! I was here before him!  The food might be savory, but what is a business with shitty customer service? NEVER AGAIN.  PS, the inside of this place is disgusting. Makes you second guess eating the food too. Gag!"}
{"text":"I love this place I alway go here but food and I love their salt & pepper pork and shrimp fried rice!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Walked in and right out as soon as I saw hair in their food."}
{"text":"I drive past this place constantly but never really hear about it- good or bad. Finally stopped in for takeout and was impressed with the quality and selection of dishes. Cafeteria-style ready-made dishes available as well as a large menu for fresh-made food, takeout is their specialty but they do have a few tables to dine-in as well.  SALT AND PEPPER PORK CHOP: Gigantic portion, flavorful and good quality cuts of pork. Wish there were a bit more peppers and onions for added flavor. SINGAPORE NOODLE: This is more or less a combination pan fried noodle dish with veggies, chicken, bbq pork, and shrimp, along with tons of veggies and noodles. Portion size can easily feed two. BOKCHOY AND BLACK MUSHROOM: Simple but good, generous portion. BEEF & PORK SHUMAI: Better than expected, and much larger than other versions elsewhere at dim sum specialty places. Bit less flavorful than expected but still better quality than most would associate with the location appearance.  Most dishes are a flat $9, their ready-made combination meals are also really affordable. Service is polite and prompt, if the order takes a bit longer than expected they may tuck in a few Hong Kong donuts in your order gratis."}
{"text":"I have never eaten inside this place and I probably never will... but call ahead and order your food and make sure they make it fresh... you will not be disappointed.   Best deal in town or anywhere I've actual ever ordered from for shumai (large pork/shrimp balls wrapped and steamed commonly seen served at dim sum dining. The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event.   Their cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here.   They have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they're cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can't beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying.   Honestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a \"Rice To-Go\" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you'll save money than ordering anywhere else. So rightfully I have to give 3 stars for awesome affordable cheap pricing, good food when you order, and for the best LARGE shumai in town!"}
{"text":"Pork hash is winnahz here if you don't know now u know suckahz hahaha jk phone ahead cuz I does take long and they also have rice cake for sale"}
{"text":"We were in vegas and ready to go back home to LA but my husband wanted to eat some Chinese food from Chinatown so we decided to look at a few near by places and their reviews. While he looked at Google reviews I of coursed looked at yelp. His had a 4.6 stars for this place and i had 2. He read a few on his and i read a few of mine.. We went with his and chose to try it out. Hate to say it but yelp is pretty on point. Soon as you walk in you notice the dirty tables and floors like a fellow reviewer staded, there are only 4 tables in the whole place and one was occupated by the owners daughter or granddaughter id guess who was painting, place was not packed so no reason for the dirtiness. The food on display looked like it was sitting there all day so we decided on going a la cart to get it fresh. I had the orange chicken and he had the general chicken, neither looked as they should at all and were ok tasting the only thing that was pretty good was the chicken fried rice. Would not recomend this place at all :/ should of went with what yelp said."}
{"text":"Rice to Go is a little hole in the wall type of Chinese fast-food. Located just off Decatur & Spring Mountain, it caters to just about anybody for that quick fix. There is nothing really special about that place that screams come on in. The parking area is small & entrance can be hard to get into and out depending on traffic since it is close to the traffic lights. Inside of the restaurant is bright white, yet easily points out how sticky icky the place could be. It is what it is, but one thing this place does serve up is flavorful and good sized portions of pork siomai.  They are a hit  especially at parties or pot lucks. One of the guy at the register, didn't get his name is very friendly though and happy to have customers of course. Sparks up conversation and very informative and funny. He speaks mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog and Spanish. Not sure if I would try any of their other stuff. Food doesn't appeal to me much, but I may come back just for the siomai."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the \"hole in the wall\" Chinese food spot this is it. Born and raised in Cali and I'm always looking for that hidden gem that has that good American Chinese foody goody. They serve the biggest and really good tasting Hawaiian style pork hash. The main guy Liu is awesome and you can tell he cooks with passion. The food up front maybe looking like it's possibly been there for a while but when you order your food they cook everything fresh. It's best to call 25 min ahead of time and do a pickup order that way it's fresh and ready. Which is why i believe it's called \"rice to go\" lol love this place. 10/10. Their beef order, general tso chicken, shrimp soup, pork hash is my favorite thing to order. :)"}
{"text":"To my Fikipino who is going to throw a party - Get the siomai. Your party will be talked about because of the siomai, I promise you. You'll be ask about it over and over again over again too.  but seroiusly they are very good and the size is 3 times the regular size."}
{"text":"Remember it is what it is. Very cheap prices and ok food for the price. Been there twice and it is what it is. If you want lots of food cheap give it a shot."}
{"text":"Nice food good atmosphere. Not expensive.  right on Chinatown. Nice family stuff. Not a bad place to go eat lunch"}
{"text":"This place is on the corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur. Kind of hidden but if you look, you'll be able to find it. They have a small parking lot that's shared with the neighboring business'. This place used to be 5 stars but the quality got so bad here. It was my favorite Chinese place in all of Vegas. I actually hated Panda Express because of how good this place was. Everything was always fresh, they cooked everything quickly, the food was great quality as well. Over the years, the quality got so cheap. The noodles even started getting over cooked a lot. The worst part was the beef (broccoli and beef) was literally like eating rubber. I was so disappointed. The fried rice is still great though! Their portions are still huge too. Maybe I'll try it again one day and hopefully it'll be better."}
{"text":"The food is so good!!! We love the siomai chicken wings and the chow mien. We always order here every occasion every person tried the siomai asking me where i got it. The owner is so friendly and always gonna give you free food :) the place is small because it is RICE TO GO, but they are graded A by health department,unlike the other places..  Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"This is place is great. Hands down the best price for almost everything they have to offer. Will definitely have catering done by them. As for the taste it's close to where I used to go out of Vegas and better than a lot others around Vegas. I only tend to get the large fried rice combo that feeds 3-4 people all for under $9.00! Recently tried the wanton soup and was equally impressed."}
{"text":"This is my regular post-haircut teriyaki stop.  Nothing too special and or amazing...standard fare that is in most teriyaki places,  but cut down to just the basic selections served in a choose-through the glass fashion.  Nothing really stands out its a pretty cookie cutter place... I would have given it two stars... But the $3.95 daily special Teriyaki cant be beat for a quick bite that doesn't bog u down.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese fast food joint in the valley. Family owned. Very friendly. Everything on menu is awesome with large portions. Try the Mongolian beef and pepper chicken. Delicious."}
{"text":"Good for Chinese fast food it's a but hotib here. They serve cans and bottles. They even gave us donuts as a treat for the kids."}
{"text":"This is for there pork hash or whatever closest one to Hawaii's one so far in Vegas don't forget your hot mustard people"}
{"text":"Well..... the facebook reviews we're very good so I just had to try this place out. When I walked in all 4 tables we're dirty as well as the chairs. Dried food on the tables and chairs. The floor looked like it hasn't been cleaned for months.   They didn't have much options that was in the glass area. The first 3 items I ordered they didn't have even though it was printed on the menu. The lady looked confused so I pointed to what I was ordering and she said no. Finally ordered eggplant, mushroom pork, pork hash, pork buns and rice cake. The mushroom pork was good but the others had no taste and was slimy feeling. The rice cake was very thin sliced and tasted like chlorine. Same as the rice that was served tasted like chlorine. They took 30 minutes for our food to come out and we we're the only customers in there besides the few people who ordered food from the glass.   I don't recommend anyone coming here. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"One of the worst places to go, the food taste like plastic. I order the broccoli and beef and I didn't get any beef. I have high blood pressure so I just let it go, don't waste your money here guys"}
{"text":"Good food bit not real clean. Pretty good selection if you ask for what you want. Pretty good deal and price. Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Was given recommendation from a regular patron, So the place is small and I would have not tried on my own. The had lots to choose from, my pick the egg foo young that was not egg but like a pancake so that was okay but not the norm. The shrimp were big and plenty. The potstickers were average and so was he shrimp fried rice. I will give another try before I make a final conclusion."}
{"text":"Back in Vegas...so, I had to stop for my favorite...chicken & eggplant!!! And it was better than the last!  I absolutely love this little mom & pop's spot.  It's just a nice friendly and down-to-earth business."}
{"text":"I love the Siomai here. They're huge and still tastes great. Be sure to call ahead of time to avoid any wait. The parking lot is also pretty small along with the actual establishment. I'd use them for catering but wouldn't actually dine in. The restaurant itself needs some TLC. The price is amazing and did I mention the Siomai?!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. This is cheap, delicious Chinese food and I have come here countless times. I enjoy all of their items and they are always friendly and remember me and my order when I come on in...  The only reason they do not get a 5 star is, that they are VERY SLOW. Especially  with larger orders. We do not mind waiting at all, at times up to 30min... We always call ahead and show up 30min later, usually still with another 5min wait. I have countless times seen people get upset with the wait but if you have time, it is worth it.  I will return and I already know I will wait but I don't mind... :)"}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by its cover. From the outside, you would not expect to receive the amazing food that they make. It is family owned & although the lady who serves you is hard to understand, it does not take away from the service & food quality. The portions were VERY GENEROUS. I could not believe how much she managed to fit in one tiny bowl. Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"this place is located in the corner of a stripmall on the edge of chinatown. i have driven by for years & seen their huge banner waving offering cheap teriyaki rice bowl specials. after a horrible experience at dq-i was up for some teriyaki chicken & rice. when you go in it a really small diner with 4 or 5 tables , a tv and the counter. the food is already made served buffet style in warmer pans on a steam table. they have 2,3 and 4 item meals & a la carte. the lady ahead of me ordered the last of the orange chicken-apparently they weren't planning on making any fresh after 5 pm. i ordered a 2 item-chicken teriyaki w/rice($4.99) & added a huge bbq rib for $2 they chicken had no kind of any teriyaki flavor but it was very tender & moist. the rice was cooked perfectly but had nothing special to it. the rib was salty tough and was like it was cooked under a heatlamp for 24 hours. the lady running the place asked me 4 times here or to go!! i thought it was rice-to-go and since the tables were dirty, the tv was off and some guy was doing paperwork in the only good bother where exactly are you gonna-for here!! i would not waste your $5 here-the ribs look good & cheap under the lights but they really really suck-everything looked like it had been sitting since at least lunch. and i went at 5 pm"}
{"text":"Experience:  I am still looking for that takeout Chinese (American style) place that has good beef and broccoli, fried rice and egg rolls. I have found many authentic places, but I also enjoy good takeout.  Saw this place, and the name made me think this might be my lucky spot.  Facility:  this is a very tiny place with 5 small tables and a takeout counter. They have a small display case with some pre-pared dishes too. It's kinda divey, but clean enough I don't feel like I have to leave.   Service: A lady came out from the back and took my order. I like that I can see them in the back cooking the food in a wok fresh. The wait was a little bit longer than I expected, so I would call ahead next time.   Food: I wasn't real hungry, so I only got 2 things.  Pork fried rice: (4.5/5) I really liked the fried rice. Most places I've tried, it's bland and even a bit dry. This was moist and flavorful. I would definitely get this again.  Egg rolls: (2.5/5) these were the big eggrolls and not small spring rolls. They were a tad greasy, but they were still decent eggrolls.   Overall:  I would come back here again. It's not the best takeout Chinese I've ever eaten, but it's better than most in Vegas I've tried. So, the search continues."}
{"text":"Never tried the food here, we come for the pork hash!   We always call ahead of time when we order for parties. 60 pieces for $36 and they're huge!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food! Service is slow due to it only being the owner and his wife working. The food is definitely worth the wait though. Singapore noodles, salt and pepper shrimp and the veggies in oyster sauce is super yummy!"}
{"text":"Rice to go is our go to party food , food are affordable, servings are generous and they taste good. I particularly love the shumai and salt and pepper fish fillet."}
{"text":"Took a bite of the teriyaki chicken and threw my whole plate away, the food tasted old, maybe because I went later in the day but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie some of these reviews are spot on... But i wanted to try & see for myself i went Wednesday May 2nd around 8pm small dine in area not the smallest or biggest ive seen. Or cleaniest or filthiest ive seen... There was a girl perhaps owner or employees daughter at a table. The food in the bins were little too none but i was here because i wanted to try... I'm glad i did. Food was excellent flavours i could only imagine if it were more fresh... I had orange chicken glaze is great kung pao delicious jalapeno chicken i believe & beef something not sure of the name but also good! The noodles aren't thin so i loved them bigger noodles rice was sitting but was sauce & glaze was on it delicious. I've found a new spot. Pricing is good too. Only down fall is only can & bottle drinks no fountain... You can order a cook to order item also which i can only imagine is tasty. I will be back. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Nothing to run home to mom about. Stopped in the other day after driving by this place so many times. A fan of teriyaki bowls and after seeing the $3.49 special sign, I decided to stop in. I'm never one to shy away from hole in the wall food and thought the $4 was worth it. A bit dark when you walk in. There was a guy sitting at a table to the left. When I walked in he got up and went behind the counter and turned on the lights above the food. Looked like they had a decent lunch rush so they must be pretty popular in the area (only know this because the trays were pretty empty and the register had a lot of receipts still attached to it. So I though I may have just stumbled upon something good. Ordered the bowl and he went into the back to fill up the to-go bowl with white rice. He came back out to front trays and topped off my rice with a bunch of teriyaki chicken. Not a bad portion for $3.50. The meat was actually pretty tender and juicy but lacked much flavor. Definately needed more teriyaki sauce. The rice was fine, no complaints. Not a horrible spot, might give it another try and have a combo so I can try the other items they have. I wouldn't recommend going outside of prime hours as the food probably sits. I stopped in around 1:30pm.  I only give 2 stars because nothing stood out about the meal or the place and the guy was grumpy and looked almost pissed off he had to get up to help me. I even left a dollar tip and it looked like it killed him when he mustered up a half-hearted \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"They have bomb shu mai and honey walnut shrimp. They don't have many tables so it's best if you order to go. Often when I order over the phone they probably just start cooking it once I get there because I usually have to wait but I don't usually mind. We usually bring their shu mai to parties and everyone loves them"}
{"text":"This place was once my family's favorite place to get food catered from. They would make us huge orders fresh and would be ready within an hour for us to pick up. The food was delicious. The quality of their food is great.  The last time we bought food from there was a terrible experience however. There was a couple waiting over 20 minutes just to pay for their meal. We waited for about 30 minutes for our food after they called us and said it was ready. Their party trays were significantly smaller than they use to serve, but would pile the food up so you get the same amount. They use those boxes from Sam's Club to help with moving the food to go. When we brought the food home, the sauces made a huge mess in our car and on our clothes. There were little leaks in their trays and seeped through the boxes. We called them about this and they really didn't have a response.  I love their food so much. But I'm not sure if we'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Rice-to-go is a no frills Chinese take out place that has fairly good food for a pretty good price.  It's nothing special, but it proved to be a pretty good quick lunch while at work option.  My only real complaint is that the lady behind the counter wasn't welcomingly friendly.  She wasn't rude by any means, just a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Idk how the food taste, but the pork hash (pork shumai) is awesome and HUGE.. I'm going back and buy a pan, Hawaiians, I promise you, this one get ACKSHUN"}
{"text":"I love to eat if I need food after I've been drinking and it could be a coincidence that there's just a bunch of bars around in the area so I'm usually drinking when I go there the staff are always nice to me and I still go there even when I'm not because it's pretty close to my house it's probably not everybody's likeing"}
{"text":"LARGE WAR WON TON SOUP TO GO PLEASE!  jam packed with pork, beef, veggies, chicken and shrimp!  this review is for the WAR WON TON SOUP only!  don't waste your time trying anything else as is mediocre, but they have a bomb war won ton soup in my opinion!  call in ahead otherwise you will be sitting and waiting a good 20 minutes while they make it.   enjoy."}
