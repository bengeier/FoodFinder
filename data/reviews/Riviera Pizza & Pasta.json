{"text":"Like an earlier reviewer, I live in Observatory Hill where there's a dearth of delivery options. We were very grateful to find Riviera Pizza! Yummy pies, fast delivery and friendly service."}
{"text":"I've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because I am able to order online. Tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him SO much grief about adding to the order that I finally took the phone. Asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. I get on the phone and this jack wagon says \"It's not MAGIC, ma'am!\" Ummm not asking for magic. He hung up on me. Solid business skills. Cancelled my order and got Dominos. Learn some people skills, you idiots"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner on 4 different occasions to ensure that it wasn't a fluke and their menu looked promising. Nope, they are consistently rude, don't keep pizza in a warmer just throw it in their cold trunk and hand it to you with the cheese no longer stringy but hard and barely warm, three of the four times the delivery person forgot part of my order!, the first time delivery took 1:40, second time it was 2:10, and the last two times were approximately 1:20. Twice the food was recklessly delivered and the sauce leaked out all over the outside and into the plastic bag which was completely coated, and the other items and they just handed it over with no words, he didn't even respond to my hello. The guy with a strong accent who answers the phone is rude and doesn't respect his customers. I'll give an example, I called to check on my order as it had been over 75 minutes and I simply said that I was checking on my order. He said \"we're busy, you can wait. It's going to take an hour\" to which I replied \"ok, well it's been well over an hour do you know when my food will be delivered?\" He said \"don't order from here. We won't take your order\" and hung up on me."}
{"text":"I think the other reviewers' taste buds may be clouded by their desires for a viable local pizzeria.  

My food was absolutely gross and an insult to Italian food.  After ordering thru grubhub and waiting an hour and a half for delivery, which was about 40 minutes past their estimated delivery time, I received my \"meal.\"  

I ordered a Stromboli, cheesy sticks, and fried dough balls. The total came to $32.00.  The cheesy sticks were edible. But the almost $20 Stromboli had little meat, no veggies, and was simultaneously soggy and burnt.  The burnt parts flaked off, revealing a slimy, spongy, salty yet tasteless mess. It was terrible. I was refused any kind of refund.

Finally, the fried dough balls basically resembled little pieces of fried chicken and had the consistency of stale fortune cookies, but without any flavor or sugar. Very strange; not edible."}
{"text":"Well, I have been ordering from Riviera for a while -- since the glory days of Riviera. 

This last order was probably the last for a while: 

Riviera used to be a solid 4, almost 5 star pizza joint to me -- quality pizza, and all the other items on their menu would be on point -- plus they came piping hot, in a short amount of time. 

However, within the last year or so prices have been JACKED up and the quality has remained the same, if not gone down hill. 

This recent order included a teriyaki chicken hoagie, chicken parmesan, and a small white pizza with tomato. The small white pizza was delicious and a great price actually. The chicken parm was expensive for what you got, and mediocre at best. The teriyaki chicken hoagie was the real problem -- it came in a complete mess, teriyaki sauce all over the top AND bottom bum, leaving it nearly impossible to eat without leaving your hands a sticky mess. Now I am not one to give a bad review simply on a messy display (please see my review of Pgh. PoBoy) - but this was just unacceptable, the teriyaki was super sticky and was an annoyance to get off while trying to grab a drink. 

This place used to be a real winner and my go-to when I got home late and needed some quick food -- sadly they are down on the list now. 

Hopefully Riviera can get their act back together and make up for those higher prices they are now charging."}
{"text":"It's okay. Portions are generous for the price but overall the food isn't that great. The pizza in particular tastes very commercialized and not homemade. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"2.5/5 - Buffalo Chicken Hoagie: Good flavor, nice texture with the potato fries, big, kinda dry.
1.0/5 - Bacon Cheeseburger: Cooked well done (ordered rare), bacon bits, shaved iceburg lettuce.  Bread was better.
2.0/5 - Breadsticks.

The last several times I've ordered for delivery, it's been around a half hour late.  The food doesn't arrive hot and fresh, either.  And this is ordering at off-peak hours (2pm)."}
{"text":"They have a solid track record with delivery to my home. The pizza and service is good enough to keep me as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Very rude staff on the phone and in person, got my order wrong, and the only employee there waited to finish a few leisurely texts before acknowledging my existence. Food is mediocre. No wonder the place was empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Called in to order delivery. God forbid you try to remove an item from a hoagie like onions because they absolutely won't do it. They were very rude when I asked them to as well. So the customer isn't always right. So anyone who is looking for something slightly customized your way (allergies) or good customer service, do not order from here because you are basically SOL."}
{"text":"This is easily the best pizza in town. Have ordered multiple different items from this place and all were excellent! Always delivery within a timely fashion"}
{"text":"The delivery guy refused to give me my proper change and did not deliver the soda I ordered. He also did not speak English so it was impossible to explain anything to him. The food was bland and the bread sticks were purposely smashed by the container of dipping sauce. The pizza was cold and the hoagie was soggy. Hoagie had no dressing and they would not make it to order. Not at all impressed and will never order from there again."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizzas in town. So we decided to try their wings.Wings are actually wing dings but flavor selection was pretty decent. We ordered 30 garlic parmesan wings around 24 bucks. As addition to pizza and wings they have very good authentic gyros."}
{"text":"Best pizza period. pizza!  You named they have it . Salads, hoagies , gyros and other delicious food to give a brake your hunger! Late and relatively cheap food!"}
{"text":"The food is so good I can not go a night with out ordering the drivers are so awesome very polite and do there best to get your order to you fast I would recommend the restaurant to anybody like I said it's so good I can't keep my self from submitting orders"}
{"text":"The chicken bacon ranch pizza is delicious! I do not know how they make their ranch taste so good, but it is addicting! All of their pizzas are loaded with toppings and cheese. I have never had a bad pizza from here. I suggest calling ahead and picking it up if you want it quicker than delivery. However, their delivery service is good too if you aren't starving. Definitely a hidden gem and worth a try."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Highly recommend.  They are very fast, professional and have never screwed up and order for me.  The pizza is VERY good!"}
{"text":"Easy to order online.  Our delivery arrived early.  Pizza was hot and had the perfect amount of toppings.  Crust is SO GOOD.  The little ranch dip is perfect for dipping that crust into.  Really enjoyed the pizza as well as the chicken sub.  Price was good for the amount of food we got. We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"We have ordered and enjoyed: buffalo chicken salad, steak salad, Caesar salad, tossed salad with cheese, spinach rolls, eggplant parmesan hoagie, the Napoleon pizza, and pizza with and without toppings. As others have mentioned, the cheesey breadsticks are great. I'm vegetarian and I love their eggplant parm, especially on the Napoleon pizza. 

We get delivery in Fineview in 45 minutes or less. I've ordered online, through Eat24 and GrubHub. I prefer Eat24 and their weekly $2 coupon, as well as their Pizza & Sticks deal for $16.99 (large cheese pizza, breadsticks & mozzarella sticks [toppings extra].)

I believe the horrible driver people have mentioned no longer works there. We've been ordering delivery on monthly basis from Riviera Pizza for over two years and have had a problem only once."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and fast delivery. Especially Salads and wings are all delicious!!!I already ordered 4 times in couple weeks."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here a lot - especially late night. The food is consistently great, and the service dependable, friendly, and quick. We like the buffalo fries with nacho cheese and bacon, buffalo chicken pizza, and some of their pasta's I've had are great as well. Best delivery place that I've had available to my home ever and I love that they deliver late!!"}
{"text":"I have NEVER been more insulted than this evening by not only the driver of this business but also the so called \"manager\" who apparently was hatched and doesn't have a name.

We ordered a combo consisting of a large cheese pizza, wings and an Italian hoagie for pickup, but then changed it to delivery. 

Upon delivery, the driver was given a $100.00 for an order of $28.00.  HE chose the tip he wanted by TAKING it out of the $100.00 and gave the change back to my daughter.

The pizza was good and so were the wings, HOWEVER, the hoagie was COMPLETELY soaked and the bread was soggy to the point that it was falling apart.  I had my daughter call the store and a man that answered the phone was screaming at my daughter telling her that it was her fault for changing from pickup to delivery.

I was sitting across the room and could hear him insulting my daughter, so I took the phone from her.  He was ranting and raving and would not stop long enough to hear that I was not the person he was originally speaking to.  He then started telling me that it's plain physics that the bread would be soggy.  Yes, he knows so much about physics which is why he is making pizzas?

Both my daughter and I asked to be credited for the hoagie and next time we ordered we would use the credit.  He continued to scream at me then hung up.

I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER order or recommend this place.  They have no idea how to treat customers - at least the women anyway.  Perhaps that is how he is used to treating women, but I will NOT put up with that.

Although the customer isn't always right, this guy has no idea that without customers at all he would not have a business.

gross hoagie 3"}
{"text":"Outstanding hot wing sauce. Not the typical sauce, different and delicious. Wings were meaty and fresh. Steak Pizza was very good as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza and ranch!! Incredibly quick delivery time! Always accurate order and have never been late."}
{"text":"I am usually a huge fan of this place. Love their food. Tonight... Not so much. I placed an order using the Eat24 app (also love & highly recommend) but the Riviera calls me shortly after stating they can't split an order. I ordered 24 wings, 12 Mild and 12 parmesan garlic. They couldn't do that? I had to order 24 of the same flavor?! What? I asked if they could just for one order of 12 and then another order of 12 and the guy in the phone said it would be $3 more. Seriously? Does anyone else not see how ridiculous this is? I asked if I could just give the delivery man $3 or would just cancel my order. The man in the phone said this time theyd split the order but next time I can't order a 24piece wing with two different flavorings. I'd have to order two 12 pieces which would cost more. Ha ha ha. Am I missing something? While I appreciate the guy offering to go out of his way to split my order, they screwed up my salad order and didn't even deliver to my door! The food is good but their ordering options using the app leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for their delivery or eat-in.  We are visiting in Pittsburgh, and wanted pizza, so we ordered Riviera pizza for pick-up.  This pizza is amazing!  We did order it with extra cheese, so please remember that, but this is great!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Pittsburgh, I had difficulty with finding a good pizza place downtown. I found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I ordered a Caesar salad, Greek salad, Philly cheesesteak sub, and a Cheese Lover's pizza. The food tasted OK, but I am on the lookout for a pizza place that is even more satisfying."}
{"text":"I will say that the service is good. I was surprised they delivered out to me. I bought chicken tenders and as I ate them thought to myself I should have listened to all my friends and gotten a pizza.
I will try again for sure"}
{"text":"This place has changed our lives. Seriously! 
My wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. 
Then, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!
The food is a solid 3.5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous. We've been desperate for a neighborhood pizza place that we actually like. Finally, the storm clouds have parted and Riviera Pizza has emerged. And we are certainly some grateful fans!"}
{"text":"We order from there at least once a week. Food is very good, my daughter likes their gyros. We normally get their hoagie special or pizza."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here since we bought our house in November. Always good food delivered quickly with nice drivers. Tonight, however, sealed the deal that we'll forever order from them. 

We accidenly overpaid the driver by $20 ... We're good tippers, but not that good (it was stuck to another bill and we didn't notice)! He came back to our house and returned the money to us. 

So now in addition to their great food, we know they also hire honest people!"}
{"text":"I am so bummed that we moved to Spring Hill 2 year ago and only discovered this place 3 months ago.  It's really in a strange place in Spring Garden - no other businesses are around and it's just this neon green building with just enough room for a counter and some pizza ovens.  But, its the closest pizza place to us and we decided to give it a try after the positive reviews it had already received.  Holy cow, jackpot!  I'm pretty picky with my pizza and this is great pizza!  I haven't had a single thing I haven't liked yet - I've had white pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, cheese pizza, strombolis (these are great!), fried mushrooms, and cheesy bread sticks (OMG, I can't wait to eat the leftovers for dinner tonight!). My hubbie has also had the steak sandwich and really liked it.  This is now our go-to for takeout when we feel lazy.  What a great little place.  

Oh, and you can order online.  So easy."}
{"text":"The guy on the phone was not very courteous and difficult to understand. They weren't very nice when we picked up the pizza either - everyone working there just seemed miserable. To top it off, the pizza was seriously disappointing. Definitely needs more garlic or sauce or something. We gave them a try because of coupons that were available, but won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this parlour to my worst enemies. After they didn't deliver my food on two seperate occasions, I was refused any sort of explanation by the rude manager on the other end of the phone. Poor customer services, awful pizza (when it DOES get delivered), they always forget the sauce or ranch, drivers who don't carry phones. Whoever is running this restaurant needs to be fired, rehired, and then fired again. Terrible."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza from here a few times--they are one of the FEW places that does North Side deliveries.  We usually get black olive + mushroom + hot pepper pizza, and it's just okay.  Better than Pizza Hut but not life-changing or anything.

Their cheesy breadsticks are AWESOME, though.  I could just eat those for dinner.  They are doughy, cheesy, and perfect.  

The service has always been speedy and the delivery guys are nice.  

If you're ordering online, make double sure you have your order right:  I ordered a small pizza one time on accident and called to make it a medium, and they couldn't change it for me over the phone--told me to go online and change it, which online ordering sites don't let you do.

**Updating my review to add a star because we have ended up ordering from them quite often.  The pizza has gotten better, they are consistently faster than their time estimates say they will be, and the delivery guys are always friendly."}
{"text":"So my wife and I just bought a house in the area 6 months ago and wish I would have tried this place earlier! Like others have said, not many places deliver to the North side. We like to go for walks, and often walk past Riveria, and their staff is always friendly and busy. I sometimes go in there to grab something to drink and figured I would give them a shot. 

I called the night of the stadium series game, right at game time, so they were busy, really busy. While I was on the phone I heard him ask 2 other customers if they could please hold while he took other orders (my order). He was polite, understood everything and I was off the phone in less than a minute. Very easy and streamlined conversation, done! He said it would be 45 minutes. My chicken ranchero pizza was here in 35, it was actually 10 minutes early!!! The delivery driver was very friendly and even said sorry about the wait, even though he was early! 

The pizza was delicious! It had lots of chicken, bacon, and fresh tomatoes. Some places like to skimp on the chicken, but they don't!! Everything was very tasty, and they even included a side of ranch to dip the crust in! (I posted some pictures of the pie) 

I will continue to order from them as they've really impressed me, I can't wait to try the calzones, strombolis and hoagies!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad from here to be delivered. The delivery guy was rude on the phone when he called to tell me he was here, I went outside to get my food and he wasnt here. I called him back and he yelled \" I'm here!!\". Sooo unprofessional and rude, especially because last time I ordered a salad there was a HAIR in it. I wish there was somewhere else closer to work that delivered on days that I forget my lunch. If I could give them o stars, I would."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. I just moved to town and my husband has been ordering for years. He said they used to be better but the prices have gone up and the quality has stayed the same. 

He ordered a chicken teriyaki hoagie and I got the chicken Parmesan. His sandwich was poorly assembled and messy. The sauce made the bottom of the bread too soggy to support the sandwich. The chicken Parmesan was only okay for the price. The chicken breast came chopped up and mixed in with the noodles which made the chicken breading on the pieces a little soggy. 

My experience wasn't terrible, but definitely not the best. Not sure if I will order here again."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in the whole world. Just fantastic! Great friendly service and there's always a coupon in Clipper magazine or the weekly circular. They have all sizes and kinds of pizzas from small to gigantic and every kind of topping. Just yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few days ago. 

Had the taco pizza.   Wasn't too great.   The pizza was real heavy on lettuce and crust and short on all the good stuff that makes a great taco pizza (beef,  jalapeños,  tomatoes,  cheese)"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here before for delivery without an issue. Last night I ordered for my family on yelp and waited over and hour with no sign of the delivery . The estimate said it was about an hour so I waited to call the restaurant. When I did call the guy you answered made me repeat the address and my order over 5 times before telling me he never got our order! I had a conformation number and email . I'll never be ordering from here again. Terrible experience."}
