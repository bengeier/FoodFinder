{"text":"Expensive and small quantity.  Rather go to Peaktop Restaurant in front of Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place!!! I came in there near the end of the day and the roasted pork is still very tasty. I was greeted warmly and wrapped it very nicely."}
{"text":"A no fuss chinese bbq place run by a mom and pop tandem. Got the roast duck and roast pork combo for $9. The duck was good but the roast pork was amazing! They serve it with drippings that you can pour over rice. Great value for money! Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ pork  Only standalone BBQ pork spot I've seen north of Steeles outside of the Markham area  BBQ pork is and has been good for years solid 8/10 Roast pork, BBQ duck and roast duck also tried both ducks get a 7.5 the pork a 7  Owners are fantastic and make every visit a pleasant one"}
{"text":"Very yummy and great service! They only take cash. BBQ pork steamed rice and roasted chicken leg hit the spot."}
{"text":"You can tell it's authentic. The owners barely speak English, and the clients were almost exclusively oriental. And then there was the roasted whole pig being rolled out of the floor-to-ceiling oven.   This place is \"Markham Authentic\", with the small menu of pictures taped to the wall, a whole four tables that will seat a grand total of about 12 people.  And meals running about $8.  I ordered a plate of BBQ and Roast Pork on rice. The pork was nice and tender, and the BBQ pork was marinated, with a nice subtle flavour. The owner/chef seemed concerned that I might not have a clue what I was ordering. No sweet and sour chicken balls-after all, I am an expert!  What's unusual but nice is finding real Char Siu in an area that has endless pizza joints. And it's only a few blocks from Chatime!"}
{"text":"Hidden inside all the way at the back in the plaza, this restaurant serves a great roast duck! We also tried the BBQ pork, which was all right, but the roast pork was amazing! It had those crunchy rinds on it. So delicious! And such an inexpensive place too. Great value for the money. The place is run by a husband and wife and they are extremely nice and friendly. The place is very clean albeit small. Not much room to sit but they serve some delicious food that is fresh. They make all their sauces and chili etc. on the premises and overall it's a great hidden gem of a place not to be missed if one is in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Wok in bbq is tucked away in a plaza on the north east side of Weston and Rutherford just past the 400. To be a bit more exact, Wok in bbq even within this plaza is located deep inside and on the corner of a plaza and can be easily missed unless you know what your looking for. My other half and I happened to be in the area, and wanted to grab a take out for dinner later on and found this place through yelp.  Upon entering, we were pleasantly greeted by the owner in a few different languages as she was I assume trying to figure out if we spoke Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese or just plain English. Once we got past this, the pleasant conversation continued as she was very very friendly and accommodating. We ordered a combo of cha siu with roast pork. She packed the take out container with rice, and a lot of veggies (broccoli and cabbage). She then proceeded to top this mountain off with the cha siu and roast pork. We were admittedly a bit disappointed at the fact that she went to the back into the kitchen to get the meat, then came out to chop it up. Usually in restaurants like this, you expect to see all the meat hanging there in all its glory and to be chopped \"fresh\". But with out seeing the meat, your not sure if it was pre made and may have been sitting there. A small thing, but still a thing. This was on a Saturday afternoon around 2 PM. Maybe they sold out at lunch? But then that would mean they had nothing left for the dinner rush, but we were still a bit surprised that it looked pretty bare when we went in.  The food itself was ok as well. Definitely better then anything you could get at an Asian super market such as T&T, but I wouldnt rank this place as one of the best Asian BBQ places I have tried in the GTA. The cha siu was a bit dry and underwhelming, and was lacking the little charred bits on the outside I have come to expect. The roast pork was also cut up fine, but not as well as other places I have tried. The other establishment I have in mind, when ordering roast pork the person chopping the meat tends to pre cut out the fat, by removing the skin/fat from the meat, then removing the fat and placing the skin back on top. Not necessary, but definitely a nice touch, which this place did not do. Again, not a big thing, but still a thing to note why I cant rank this as one of the best places I have ever tried in the GTA. I would rank this place as a pretty solid 3 out of 5, but the lady behind the counter is again super duper friendly. And did not seem stingy at all with the quantity. So what this place lacks in taste and quality, more then makes up for in personality and quantity.   If I am in the area, and had a real hankering for Asian BBQ I wouldnt mind coming here. But I would hesitate to go out of my way to come here, or recommend any to go out of their way to come here to eat."}
{"text":"Tiny. Place. What?  This fantastic hidden gem in Vaughan located near the 400 and Rutherford is a treat.  The good. Perfectly crispy BBQ pork and duck. Sensational accompanying sauce(?) That is neither too sweet but just savory with a hint of sweetness. Rice that keeps you coming back for more. Fresh vegetables. Did I mention the chow mein???  The bad You walk in and feel like you may have made a mistake. Sticky tables. Cash only. Styrofoam and plastic cutlery. Food court feel.  The redemption Mom and Pop restaurant.  You can meet and be greeted by the chef. Amazing customer service despite language barriers. Clean nutritious food. Not greasy and no bad after tastes.  These guys are completely amazing and a rarity worth savouring. Not your average chinese BBQ."}
{"text":"Small husband and wife run Chinese BBQ - only one North of Finch.  $7.50 BBQ pork, rice and veg; $8 for BBQ pork and Roasted Duck  Updated review: Here's the deal - they brine the whole pig, then grind a proprietary dry rub from scratch, and then roast or BBQ to perfection.  And that's just the pork.    They literally sell out everyday before 6pm so call in the morning or better yet the day before to guarantee your food."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop shopping serving authentic Cantonese style BBQ. The shop owners are super friendly and u can even call ahead to get your perfect crispy duck or roast pork.  The place has sit in eating for those who want a quick fix b4 a full day of shopping close by."}
{"text":"Very friendly people. The pork and duck was very delicious.   My first impression of the place was wow.... Ghetto. The food must not taste as good.   But when I tried it. It was amazing. The pork was crispy and so flavourful. The people were super nice and amazing, extremely sociable.   I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Wow. Honestly i was expecting craptacular bbq duck and pork but it was really good. Not soggy, and just enough saltiness. The BBQ pork had that satisfying crunch people come to these types of places for. Had a conversation with the owner and practice my not-too-good-cantonese and she was very nice about it."}
{"text":"Love the authentic Chinese BBQ of this place.  Small with only few seats but we usually get take out, owners are super nice and makes the best BBQ duck in town.  BBQ pork noodles is also our favourite dish.  Really nice and hidden gem in Vaughan."}
