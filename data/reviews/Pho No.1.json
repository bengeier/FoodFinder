{"text":"6.99 for a HUGE bowl of pho.   Their soup is homemade and the beef is just tender enough, and they always give so generously.   You can add an extra bowl of soup for 2$..if you can still stomach it after your first bowl of pho.  If you catch their morning-4pm specials, you can get the L1 combo of Pho and Spring-roll for 6.99$ (essentially adding a spring-roll to a regular sized pho)  Come here all the time now."}

{"text":"My first time going there! It look SO much nicer inside than it does outside.  I'm surprised of how classy it is considering it's area. Definitely nothing like it. I got the spicy curry chicken and it definitely has a nice flavour and spice. Taste very homemade and warms me in the right way. Good for small groups too. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place another star.  Came as a couple on a Saturday for lunch.  Had the Tom Yum soup, red chicken curry, deep fried tofu, and tofu pad thai.  The soup was very good.  Lots of chicken and vegetables.  The tofu was alright.  No dipping sauce, but a decent portion.  The pad thai was okay as well, but just okay.  It was mainly rice noodles, and I think there were literally three tiny cubes of tofu.  Also, it was supposed to be spicy, and I didn't detect almost any of it.  One of the few times I didn't take the leftovers to go.  The red curry was a huge disappointment.  It wasn't red, and it had almost no flavor whatsoever.  I have no reason to ever go back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 dishes for take out, was skeptical because the place was completely empty. The portion came out to be good and taste was not bad. Might come back because it's so close to my parent's place,  not worth a special trip though"}
