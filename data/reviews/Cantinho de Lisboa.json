{"text":"Very nice staff. I had the feijoada and it was delicious.  I recommend the pastries too."}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty. Proprietor takes a sincere interest in the quality of the meals. Beautiful presentation. Three course omelet dish!"}
{"text":"We were planning on going to Olive & Gourmando, but we arrived at 8 and it was not open until 9 and this place was right across the way.   I'm glad we spotted it and that O&G was closed because this place was a gem and likely wouldn't have known about it otherwise! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The coffee was delicious (they also warned the milk) and the pastry was divine. We would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast but they offer limited choice, mainly omelette. It was really shocking that they served the first dish and the last one with 10 minutes delay!!!! So my poor friend who got it first had to wait for all of use to get our food.The waitress told us the omelette would come with fruits. Although we ordered 5 omelette, she brought us two dishes with very very small amount of fruits on each. Also when we asked for more bread to eat with our jam, they charged us more! But, I should add that the atmosphere of cafe was really nice."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast -- pastries were exceptional, esp. the croissants, and great coffee too."}
{"text":"Freshly made everything! Stopped in for breakfast. Organic foodie fan stop. Awesome ham & cheese omelet, orange cake, and yogurt/granola topped w/fresh blueberries. Helena, the owner has her grandmother's original recipes on parchment paper artfully framed on the walls. Adorable cafe, great food!"}
{"text":"Sandwich proscuito sua grosse coche avec des champignons. Servi avec une salade verte et des toutes petites frites."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! The portugeuse nata pastries were deliciousness, it was my first time trying them and I'd strongly recommend it. I also had the fishball and porkball, both of which were loaded with flavor. The salmon salad sandwich was a family favorite. The location and ambiance were great of course."}
{"text":"In a touristy neighborhood with a ton of expensive (and probably mediocre) restaurants, it was nice to find Cantinho de Lisboa. I just wanted a light brunch and this place was perfect. The cafe is so warm and inviting when you enter- loved the quaint, old-country atmosphere. Servers were friendly and efficient. I ordered an omelette which, to my delight, came with a small plate of beautiful fresh fruit and 'tartine' with butter and jam as a starter. My omelette was perfectly cooked and came with a few baby potatoes and some fresh mixed greens on the side. Everything was nicely presented and delicious. Another reviewer mentioned expensive sandwiches...my bill was less than $10US with a beverage. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Walked by this place just as they were opening and it looked so lovely inside I decided to stop and have lunch.   I ordered a latte and the beet, potato, and chorizo salad. It was a fantastic choice. Very fresh, very well done. I took the raspberry, vanilla, coffee pannecotta to go and had it later after dinner. Again, fantastic! I never tried any pastries but they looked amazing.   The service was very quick and very polite.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After a failed attempt getting into another restaurant, we stumbled upon this gem! What a pleasant surprise! With rich, hearty, earthy flavors, my palate was ooohing and ahhhing the whole time! This Portuguese influenced hotspot was warm and friendly to start. We had to order at the register first, and then the staff brought our food to us. From the simple ham and cheese croissant sandwich, the salmon and avocado sandwich and the hearty puréed vegetable soup, each person enjoyed their respective dishes. The complex layers of spice and flavors made each bite delightful. Also of note was their stew-like Feijoada, which had a tomato base with stewed pork, carrots, and a medley of spices. It was served with crunchy bread crisps seasoned with various herbs and spices which also paired perfectly when soaked in either the soup or the stew. The Americano and Mocha were absolutely divine as well~~the Americano was similar to gritty Turkish coffee, but much milder and less gritty. The mocha had actual chocolate in it, melting away at the bottom. Finally, the brownies were the last item to mention be use they were dense, but not too sweet. Perfection! I flagged this spot for a future stop!"}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee and bites. Service is friendly though on the slow side for a café. I would recommend their almond croissants!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to go to Olive et Gourmando on a Monday (they're closed then) and this place was right across the street. What a treat! We had their omelettes which were done very well. They came with fruit and baguettes.   On the way out they had some cookies fresh from the oven, that were fantastic. Give it a shot, you won't regret it. People were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Cheapest place you're going to get natas in Old Montreal.  This is not a bad place, cute little area. You could go to the other Taberna just beside it, but the natas there are a whopping $3 each. Ouch.  Will definitely come back for a coffee here and a pastry."}
{"text":"Five star for this little place because of first its service and then for its simple but creative and delicious Portuguese  dishes and it's location. This place is at the heart of old Montreal, just across the street from Olive and Gourmondo, which was the place we planned to have lunch, but we didn't want to endure the crazy wait time and rushed service there. How lucky of us to give this little place a chance. Helena, our server, made us feel right at home by explaining the menu and taking the time to understand what we liked. She even taught us a few Portuguese words. We had their seafood salads with garbanzo beans and warm sandwiches as well as their deserts and coffee.  Their coffee was was excellent. We loved the friendly service and the location, and the food was delicious and unique but reasonably priced. I loved it, definitely will come back here next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Popped in here randomly with high expectations for some awesome natas but was left pretty disappointed. There were several flavors available which we tried (maple and hazelnut) but all fell flat. The place itself is part bakery and part groceryesque with lots of items to purchase off the shelf (all Portuguese of course). There are also a couple seats available if you want to eat in house. Very cute place, but the natas aren't very good unfortunately! Can't speak for any other items so come check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"Just had to grab a couple Pasteis de Nata while on my way somewhere else, but they were some of the best I have ever had. Delicious"}
{"text":"Went there as a part of a walking food tour. Very reasonably priced prepared foods - great for a snack. Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's a simple but cozy place. A resto as well a marketplace for some small stuffs such as jams, cheeses and cold cuts. Foods are delicious, people are friendly, not much to complain."}
{"text":"Cute little place to get a cup an espresso and croissant. Great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and get some rest after long walk. Restaurant is very very clean and welcoming atmosphere. Restroom is very clean too. Staff is nice and helpful. We ate vegetarian sandwich and tried a few desserts. They were all delicious. This neighborhood is little bit more expensive than other restaurants but it is okay when you convert to US $.  And definitely worth it because everything is delicious. After tou eat, check the other items that you can see all over the cafe. You will find something interesting, buy it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here once we saw the wait at Olive st Gourmando.  What wonderful luck!! This place is amazing. Such fresh food with a quant, cozy atmosphere. My boyfriend had the prosciutto sandwich and I had the octopus salad. Additionally, we got a bottle of sparkling cider to accompany lunch. I would recommend stopping in for a refreshing meal!"}
{"text":"Very good and extremely reasonable priced lunch menu.  I had the prego sandwich with soup (potato chorizo) and a creamy sour and sweet dessert.  The meat in the prego sandwich was succulent and tasty. The poached eggs was a little over cooked but nonetheless was tasty.   The only drawback was the order my lunch came in. It started with dessert then drinks them main and finished with the soup."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and couldn't have been more satisfied!  I ordered the smoked salmon with cream cheese.  Changed the bread to multigrain bread instead of reg sesame bagel and it was just PERFECT.  The ratio smoked salmon, cream cheese, and caper and onions was perfectly put together.  The smoke salmon was extremely fresh as well.  My husband and the croissant with ham, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and he said he was just right and amazing.  We also order cod croquette and beef croquette which were both very good.  also- service was really great.  Decor was catchy and awesome  Would totally recommend."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place while waiting for the infamous brunch joint across the street. At first I thought that it was a French cafe, but then...I found Portugese egg tarts! Portugese egg tarts are one of the only eggy desserts that I truly enjoy. So without further delay, I ordered a cup of espresso and a tart. The tarts come in large and small sizes. They also carry some other pastries and sandwiches.the egg tart was sweet (as expected) and a bit airy to the bite. The tart was served cold, which was great since the temperature was warm. The coffee was good as any other cafes in montreal.   They have a nice dining area with lots of natural lighting. However, I have to take a star because of the constant crowds that squeeze themselves inside the store. I think this cafe is a stop for a Montreal food tour. Overall, a great place to hangout and grab a snack while waiting for brunch in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Pricy, but what isn't here?  The rest is just perfect. Topped with the most amazing cheesecake.  Thank you for a great breakfast (turned into brunch)"}
{"text":"Voilà quelque chose d'intéressant dans le Vieux-Montréal. Ouvert en avril 2014 par Helena, cette chef du resto portugais qui porte son nom sur la rue Mc Gill, cet endroit sympathique a de beaux jours devant lui. Un mélange d'épicerie, de boulangerie, de traiteur et de restaurant, on y sert également des plats pour emporter. À fréquenter sans modération. Passez le mot !"}
{"text":"Très belle épicerie dans le vieux Montréal. J'y suis allé plusieurs fois depuis son lancement mi-2014, autant il y avait peu d'habitués au début, autant désormais beaucoup aiment venir chercher leurs lunchs ici ! Je trouve cela assez révélateur de l'intérêt de l'établissement, surtout lorsque celui-ci se trouve juste en face du très prisé Olive et Gourmando. Le service est ici toujours amical, j'opte à chaque fois pour le menu pour emporter entrée-sandwich-dessert. Les salades sont excellentes, j'ai un faible pour le sandwich à la sardine et les desserts ne m'ont jamais déçus ! Si vous vous sentez d'attaque, optez aussi pour les pasteis de nata, ils sont excellents."}
{"text":"I came here this morning for breakfast with my family,it's a small Portuguese cafe offering breakfast, lunch & dinner. Very quick  & easy to get to from the hotel St. Paul Seating holds about 15 people on bar stools with a larger  table in the back with chairs can seat approximately 6-8 people. This is a good spot to get your early morning pastry & coffee.  They also sell Portuguese cooking sauces & condiments, jams,cheese etc. from Portugal-I'm buying some items to bring home to Toronto cause they have a selection you can't get there. Did I mention how perfect the pateis de natas are?! Well it's the best I've ever had! I've eaten these my entire life and nothing compares to theirs; first it's pastry is light flaky but not too flaky where it falls apart on you. Then the custard filling is a perfect balance of sweet & custard taste. The ones I get in Toronto are good but most of the time they are too sweet,not enough custard flavour & the pastry is too firm.(I think they \"cheap\" out to make a buck; So I'm buying a dozen or two to bring back to have.  The price range is decent, keep in mind it's in the tourist spot of old Montreal. I had a mushroom & cheese  omelette sandwhich on a ciabatta style bun for $10 it came with some fruits. The ham & cheese croissant was $4.50. Taste was good what I expected.  The coffee (cafe au lait) was exceptional, milk foam was thick, coffee was smooth. I could drink 5 cups easily. A lot of people were grabbing takeout.  Overall if you visit old Montreal this place is a must try for the custard tarts (pateis de natas)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  My second time visiting this location and it's consistent in term of taste and service."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful place! Truly beautiful...from the people working, to the store, to the food....all is gorgeous! Ate here 2 times while in montreal! LOVED it all.   After spending time in Braga and Porto I felt like I was back in Portugal! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is delicious and authentic - the food is amazing and made to order, and the sweets are something to write home about. Try the orange swirl pudding cake - unsure of the name of it but it is to die for.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"It is quite charming but the food is okay to bland. I got a stew and it was lukewarm, watery, and had a half-poached egg on top where the whites were still uncooked and clear."}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH EVER! New to Canada and Montreal. We were actually planning to have a sit down meal somewhere. It turned out to be way better to pack up a sandwich and keep moving to old port. The sandwich here was brilliant! It is at the junction of Saint Paul and Saint Pierre, opposite another crowded gem Olive and Gourmando. Honestly, if you are in the area, you should stop by!"}
{"text":"It's cute spot but the wait staff takes a while to handle orders. More a cafe than a sit down restaurants with a few basic breakfast items"}
{"text":"We were going to go across the street for breakfast but it was packed. So we wandered in here. No one was in there so I was skeptical.   They didn't have a menu but I asked and she said oh yea we have breakfast and gave me a menu. The veggie egg breakfast sandwich was excellent as were the accoutrements. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a breakfast cafe."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe, pastis de nata were delicious and fresh and staff were very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Looking for decent but pricey sandwiches in Old Montreal ? Well, Look no further coz Cantinho de Lisboa offers exactly that. Sandwiches that taste good (not great) come neatly packaged in a nice takeout box and a fancy paper bag. If you get a combo during lunch (Sandwich plus soup/salad), you get a tiny complimentary dessert. So next time you are in old Montreal and you wish for a fancy takeout box and neat paper bag, and if you are hungry.... Then THIS is the place you go to. Or if you just want a great sandwich, walk across the street and grab one from O&G.   Food : Good Service :Fast Ambiance : Cozy Worth the price : umm......err...... maybe"}
{"text":"Delicious food and selection of Portuguese goodies was heavenly. So glad I found that place!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for coffee - and so glad we did.  The staff and store are both cheerful.  They had a nice selection of Portuguese decorations (think painted roosters), cookbooks, food items and utensils.  Best of all though, they have coffee and pastries.  My cappuccino was perfect and my pastry was *amazing*, to die-for.     Would I return:  Yes Would I recommend:  Yes"}
{"text":"I recommend the little round custard pies. We ordered some and quickly ordered more. The staff is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Today while visiting Old Montreal we stopped in at this Portuguese bakery and cafe for some lunch. Overall I loved the atmosphere here and it reminded me of a newer aged take on traditional Portuguese food.   We ended up buying two bifana sandwiches which came with an arugula salad and potato sticks. The meal was delicious but definetly a newer variation of a traditional sandwich. The Natas here also looked incredible which are always a staple in Portuguese bakeries.  The final highlight from our visit was the service we received from the staff. They spoke to us in Portuguese which was a nice shift from the broken French we have been using and when we received our bill we loved the fact that they wrote \"Casal Portugues\" or \"The Portuguese Couple\" at the bottom of our receipt which made us very happy! We totally recommend stopping at this cafe."}
{"text":"VERY YUMMY! Lots of flavor and very fresh. There are seats in the rear of the shop. The server spoke French, Portuguese, and English. The little tarts are like cheesecakes. Heavenly! It's a great place to grab relatively quick food. My toddler was a fan of the cured sausage, which is a great grab-and-go snack while walking the city."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick brunch. Really great pastries, coffee and sandwiches! Very friendly girls work inside as well!"}
{"text":"This was a really cute place. The lady who owns it shares the recipes of her grandmother. She framed the written recipes and placed them throughout the cafe.  We sat at the tables I  the back of cafe to rest our feet and charge up our mobile devices. This cafe was part of 'The Old Montreal' food tour. I got the potato soup and Cobb Salad."}
{"text":"Lovely cafe, friendly service and great food. Make sure to order the pastel de nata, creamy and delicious and maybe the best in town. We also ordered the Caldo Verde, made with potatoes, Portuguese spices, sausage and some veggies - recommended by the staff and one of the best soups I have had so far. The cafe is also a store which has various cute things to see/buy. We will for sure be back next time we travel to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Heerlijk ontbijt hier, van omelet tot zoetigheid. Koffie is redelijk. Heel gezellig en supervriendelijke bediening. Aanrader!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop on St Paul Ouest.    They serve breakfast, sandwiches, salads, pastries, coffee, etc.  We went there for lunch and I got an Octopus Salad !   Perfect.  The meat was tender and tasty, well seasoned...not chewy at all.   The kale, peppers and other greens were fresh and perfect.   The only thing I wish was that the portion was a bit larger, but it was a great deal for CAD $13.  For dessert I got a cream filled palmieri and it was flaky, sweet and well prepared.  They also have Portuguese nata pastries, Queijadas, and many other delicious Old World desserts.    A nice spot in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I went to Portugal for the first time a few months ago and a good portion of my diet while there was octopus. I had a craving and saw this place so I stopped in here for a quick lunch with my mother while she was in town. The octopus salad hit the spot 100%. The octopus was tender and plentiful and there was a great balance of flavor throughout the salad. My mother had a shrimp salad sandwich that she liked. It had a little kick to it to make it more interesting.   They were sadly out of natas when we came, but we tried a few of their other custard desserts and enjoyed them a lot. I would definitely like to come back and try more of their menu, although I don't know if I'll be able to not order that octopus salad.   The price wasn't bad, my salad was I think $13 Restaurants can sometimes get crazy with prices for octopus/seafood in general so I think it was a fair price, especially considering it's in Old Montreal where everything is at least a few dollars more expensive than you want it to be."}
{"text":"What a beatiful place. I'm not sure what Cantinho de Lisboa is, a coffee shop, brunch restaurant or simply a market with Portuguese ambiance, but I can tell you, they have good coffee, absolutely amazing pasteis de nata and superbly friendly personnel. It all started with my desire to serve pasteis de nata at my Birthday party, which lead to a biking trip dedicated to check the quality of this wonderful pastry. We had the standard size and mini pasteis, and they were both amazing, delicious filling and crunchy tart shell. The next week I ended up ordering a box of the mini pasteis and my guests were very happy with them. I didn't have time to warm them up in the oven as suggested in the store, but next time when I have another craving for pasteis de nata I would certainly do so, or just consume them at Cantinho de Lisboa."}
{"text":"Ok j'ai essayé  le sardines , le fruits de mer et aujourd'hui  sandwich omelette  végétarienne  pas vege . Lolso delicious  and buttery accompagné  de salade d'epinards 10$ imbatable"}
{"text":"This lovely cafe is across the street from the famed Olive and Gourmando.  While their name is on their window, it can be hard to spot. Well, it was for me because I'm so hypnotized by the beauty and charm of Old Port, I've walked passed them a zillion times.  I wanted to try the octopus salad some Yelpers raved about, but as fate would have it, they were out. I wasn't in a sandwich mood so none of their amazing looking sandwiches appealed to me. I asked about other food items. The cashier cheerfully began to rattle off suggestions but she had me at feijoada.    I instantly thought of Anthony Bourdain and his coverage of Sao Paolo on The Layover. I recalled him saying he would eat feijoada over ANYTHING.  Any thing?  ANYTHING.  Never having tried it myself and still in mourning of his death, it was a no brainer. Being in Old Port was a far cry from the hole in the wall AB visited but it was so good, I will be exploring more Brazilian food.  Especially this flavor bomb called feijoada.  The feijoada was beautifully served in a small cast iron pan which looked intimidating but perfectly portioned so not to give you a food coma. Or maybe I just have a really big appetite.  Don't get me wrong, it's a hardy meal. It's just compared to the other ladies in the restaurant with their dainty salads, I felt like a complete glutton.  If that wasn't enough, I actually wish I had a pile of rice with this. Because I think AB had his with rice. Ugh...rice would have been good but would put you way over the top full. If you're ever in this predicament, think of AB. In the words of the late and great Anthony Bourdain, \"Your body is not a temple. It's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.\"  Definitely try the feijoada here. It's so good and the staff loves to serve it because it smells and tastes delicious.  They also had amazing looking desserts. I will be back to try the octopus salad but will probably have to order the feijoada, too, because it's that good!  If you do leave this place in a food coma, walk half a block to Flyjin for a latte. That should get you sorted and back to sight-seeing normal.  Here's to you, AB. Thank you for broadening our horizons and our bellies.  RIP."}
{"text":"Such a cute place to have breakfast before exploring for the day. We ordered an almond croissant, chocolate croissant and pastei de nata. Everything was delicious! They did forget about our coffee and tea but no biggie. They also have delicacies for sale such as olive oils, cookies, maple syrup etc. While we were there, there were two groups that came in briefly. They looked like they were food walking tours. So I guess this place is considered legit!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast before we left town and this place could not have been better! Super cute and the service was wonderful...the young lady behind the counter went out of her way to make us feel welcome. We ordered a veggie omelet with chorizo and 2 croissants...OMG this was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had. On our next trip to Montréal we absolutely will return to Cantinho!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Cantinho de Losboa is located in Old Montreal on St. Paul.  The space is very comfortable and charming inside. Ordering is done at the counter and a server brings the food to your seat when it is ready. They have some Portuguese items for sale in the store also.  I had this Portuguese sandwich that was awesome. It had really great bread and pork, chicken and cheese with a slightly spicy tomato sauce on top and a fired egg. This was delicious and filling. They also make omelets and we had one with Chorizo that was fantastic.  The coffee and pastries were also excellent. This is a great little restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Cute shop/restaurant. Excellent food no matter what I've tried. Highly recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is run by the nicest lady. The food is good too - we were supposed to be having tea somewhere but we couldn't resist having a nata and apple pie, both of which were delicious. The apple pie would have been better warm, though. We had cans of Zumol, which was very expensive - I think you can probably have it cheaper at one of the Portuguese roast chicken restaurants - but I'm ok with paying a premium for the nicer environment and also being in Old Montreal. We will definitely be back to have a full meal here!"}
{"text":"Joli café et epicerie, j'avoue que c'est cher mais le gout est delicieux , mon sandwich au saumon acompagné avec soupe et dessert pour 18$ m'a sauvé d'une file d'attente du resto populaire juste d'en face.. Alors pourquoi faire la file si on peut avoir un bon repas sans file ;)"}
{"text":"Worst service! We went hungry and left hungry after an hour!  All we ordered were omelette, croissants and coffee. After 5 mins another waitress came and asked for the order again cos apparently they missed the order first time. THEY NEVER PUT IN THE ORDER even after that! All we got was just the coffee and 40 mins later they ask us if we want the Cheque! Never ever coming back again!"}
