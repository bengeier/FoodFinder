{"text":"I have gone here fairly often and it is good. However, when ordering on Tapingo they don't always look at your full order. I asked for dressing on the side because they tend to smother it in dressing. Yet every time they do my dressing for me and I have to get it corrected. It really takes away the fast and efficient part of the process if you have to remake it when I get there."}
{"text":"High quality and healthy choices, efficient and friendly service"}
{"text":"The customer service was definitely below average on my first visit. Sheila muttered everything she said (seriously, I couldn't hear her) and never even hinted at a smile. The other two gentlemen were more pleasant to talk to and thankfully kept the experience a pleasant one. The salad and all of the condiments tasted fresh. A fair salad for a fair price."}
{"text":"I love this place on campus but 
The staff is very rude ! The guy is the only nice one there ."}
{"text":"I eat here because I go to UNLV and it is one of the few healthy options and I have been loyal until I got sick. The employees don't seem happy but I'm willing to go through that in order to obtain a healthy meal. I know for sure it was the romaine salad that sent me to the doctor. My partner and I ate there and we were both super sick. Basically, I had to miss a week of work because I got E. Coli. I want to eat here again but I'm afraid of getting sick again."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch during my daughters orientation. I'm happy to see there are healthy options for the students here at UNLV. You basically just choose your own ingredients for your salad and they mix it up for you and serve it in a to-go container. I ordered the kale salad. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and I was pleased with the salad. This is probably the healthiest place to eat while your at UNLV. I would recommend that you give it try."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places on campus. The manager, Rhandi, is great and always smiling. The topping selection is decent, and the addition of pasta makes it filling and satisfying."}
