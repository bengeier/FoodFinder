{"text":"Great selection of teas and tea lattes. Tried both the scones and cupcakes, which were lovely. The place is small, and many students come here to study, which means it can be hard to find a table or place to sit. A little pricey for a regular thing, but overall super cute cafe."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get some serious work done. It has great wifi, delicious desserts (Point G macarons!), and a superb selection of tea. 
After you order at the cashier, they bring all of your drinks & desserts to your table which I think is really nice. Their huge selection of tea always has me taking too long from making my choice. When you do order, you get your own personal teapot that is very cute. I've never had trouble with their wifi even with the cafe being completely full of students. With a few macarons to aid your brain, this cafe is a great place to study, work, or chat with some friends."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, wonderful selection of well made teas. Would recommend the monks blend or earl grey lattés."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this gem while visiting the area and we can't recommend it highly enough! The interior is beautifully decorated and very clean, and it's obvious that everything has been thought out and well cared for. The staff is very friendly. Alex greeted us and made an excellent recommendation (dragon pearls - very good!). Our drinks were served hot, smelled lovely, and tasted even better! We also had a fresh scone, which was served with some tasty jam. Next time we're in Montréal, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's cozy, nice music selection, comfortable chairs and couches, a wide variety of teas and desserts, and affordable prices.

I usually go there, order a teapot (which lasts for 4 or 5 cups) seat next to the window where I have lots of natural light and draw or read for several hours. 

Nobody bothers you and you don't have an annoying waiter coming every two minutes to ask if everything is ok.

The hot tea is great and they also have bubble tea with tapioca. 

Definitely one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I ordered bubble tea and macaron. The macaron was tasty and fresh but I didnt like the bubble tea so much. The atmosphere and the music playing in the background were nice."}
{"text":"Je cherchais une bonne place pour étudier pour mi-session.  Très bonne ambiance et place très confortable. La place était néanmoins très bondé et nous avons eu de la difficulté à trouver de la place. Malheureusement, le wifi n'était vraiment pas top (très difficile de se connecter et une fois connecté, très lent). 
Je donne 3 étoiles parce-que notre première théière de thé était brûlée mais on nous a gentillement offert de nous remplacer la prochaine si ça venait à se reproduire."}
{"text":"Well, at 4.88 min for a tea, this place is mad expensive.

But the interior is very nice and quiet, seems like a good place to work.

The iced tea was nicely made.

I will go back occassionally if I need to work or meet people at a cafe but wouldn't go just for the tea"}
{"text":"Coffee houses are plentiful in Montreal but not every cafe offers decent tea. Even chic and highly-rated places can disappoint with mediocre (and expensive!) bagged tea. I stopped into Chai Tea Lounge on a cold and damp afternoon and was delighted to find high-quality loose leaf tea served to me in a pot on a lovely wooden tray. I visited on a weekday so it was not very busy, which was perfect, as I could find a seat, warm my frozen toes and charge up my phone a bit. I ordered the Earl Grey and it was gorgeous. I also ordered a slice of their chocolate zucchini bread- wow! Deep, dark chocolate flavor and incredibly moist - it was delectable! Service was prompt and friendly. Decor is sleek but still warm and welcoming. Lots of tables, some with power outlets beneath. I was in the neighborhood to see a film at the wonderful indie movie house down the street - Cinéma du Parc - and would definitely drop in again on a future visit!"}
{"text":"Nice place to chill or get some work done. Good macaroons and the flower tea I ordered was good too. It was pretty empty when I went in the afternoon so I got a nice spot. Only problem was the plugs in the wall didn't work!"}
{"text":"Quiet study ambiance. Modern decor. Student hangout. Good selection of tea. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of sweet goodies, amazing tea, and good atmosphere. The matcha lattes are delicious and frothy. Although it can be quite loud at times, Chai is one of my favorite places to study. Too bad getting a seat can be difficult during exam season. I love to go at night when it's pretty empty."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit! Comme je ne bois pas de café, j'aime bien un endroit où ils savent faire du bon thé. Ils ont leur propre ligne de thés et une carte assez variée qui peut répondre à tous les goûts: thés blancs, verts, oolongs, noirs, matés, matcha, roiboos, tisanes, bubble tea, thé lattés... Et qui peut résister à des scones chauds servis avec du beurre et de la confiture?Certainement pas moi! 

Il y a des tables pour travailler et des divans si on veut juste relaxer. Personnellement, j'aime bien aller y passer un après-midi à lire dans un divan avec mon amoureux, un bon thé et un scone. C'est aussi un endroit idéal pour travailler puisque le niveau de bruit est assez bas et il y a beaucoup de places assises. Le personnel est chaleureux et serviable. On ne se sent pas poussés à partir une fois notre théière terminée. D'ailleurs, on peut faire remplir notre théière d'eau chaude gratuitement.

Il y a aussi la possibilité de manger un repas léger (soupe, sandwich ou salade) qui vient du resto d'à côté, le El Mundo (qui a été condamné deux fois par la Ville de Montréal pour insalubrité, en passant)."}
{"text":"The cupcakes are really sweet. I am not a big fan of their environment. No savory snacks available. I love their latte but it's the same as the one you get next door at El Mundo. Beautiful tea sets."}
{"text":"Welcoming service, very cozy and delicious treats and drinks with many options. Love it! xxx"}
{"text":"First things first, let me admit that I would be highly tempted to give an extremely bad review to this business, simply to keep this GEM to myself. However, it would be impossible for me to do so, not only because Christmas time is near (and X-Mas is a time to share), but also because everything about this tea lounge makes me all warm inside. They have a very large selection of white, green, black, Wulong, Herbal, Flower teas, as well as Pu'er, Rooibos and Mate. Whether you like your tea pure and simple, sweet and fruity, bitter, or tangy, they have an option for you. Aside from having a ginormous assortment of beverages, they also offer a wide selection of pastries: Cupcakes, macaroons, name them! (not to mention that they are de-li-cious!)

Last time I visited, I tried the Long Island Strawberry Green Tea, which was delightful, as the bitterness of the green tea balanced perfectly the sweetness of the strawberries. A friend of mine tried the Kyoto Cherry Green Tea (which is apparently one of their most popular teas), and she seemed to have enjoyed it just as much. 
I also decided to give their macaroons a try: I ordered three, i.e. Salty Caramel, Latte and Maple, and they all tasted very good. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Alright! This is a decent tea lounge with a wide selection of teas and a peaceful ambiance. 

I like how peaceful this lounge was; there are two sides, one with some couches and comfy chairs. It seems to be popular with university students, as it gets pretty busy during university exam season. 

There was only one girl behind the counter, taking orders and making the drinks, which slowed down the service. I ordered a taro bubble tea, and it was as little too frothy for my taste. It was also a little too milky, and the tapioca--while tasty--was too soft. The tapioca bubbles kept getting stuck in the straw, which made it a little difficult to drink. It was made with a black tea, and the taro flavour was quite good.

I would recommend this tea lounge if you're looking for a peaceful atmosphere to do some work. It's got lots of seating, but it can be pretty busy during university exam season. I would suggest their raspberry hot chocolate, which I quite enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Location: Parc Avenue above Sherbrooke. You can easily walk from downtown in about 10 minutes, depending on where you're walking from. 

The place: I quite liked the space - it's very spacious with high ceilings and neutral colors. It felt very Zen, which of course, I like. Great music, too, which is key because I can't hang out in a place with sh*tty music. They have a great leather couch that we took possession of, as well as leather armchairs and your standard tables. The couch is definitely prime real estate. 

Service: Good - the girl behind the counter was friendly and patiently waited for us to decide what kind of tea we wanted. Once we made up our minds, we paid, went to sit down and waited for her to bring us our pot in a nice little tray with two pretty cups. No complaints here!

The tea: They have a huge selection so I can't imagine a person not finding at least one tea that they like. I was feeling lazy so asked the clerk for a recommendation - something to help with digestion. Upon her suggestion, I opted for an herbal blend that turned out to be amazingly delicious. When I asked, the clerk told me that most of their teas were from Camellia Sinensis, though I'm not sure the herbal blends are because I couldn't find mine on the C-S web site (EnerTea). 

The perks: If you've read my reviews for Point G and Les Glaceurs, you know that I am a HUGE fan of macarons and Red Velvet cupcakes.  I was positively delighted to find that Chai carries both brands - SCORE! The clerk did tell me that they buy the cupcakes in bulk and freeze them which I tend to dislike, but the mini cupcake that I had was just as good as buying it directly from Les Glaceurs so it passed the test. I would image that they also buy the macarons in bulk and freeze these as well, but I forgot to ask. They offer a combo that includes a pot of tea + 2 macarons for around $7-8, or you can buy a box of macarons (different format - you pick the flavors) which ranges in price from $9.75 for six, and upward.  Free refills on your pot of tea. 

Price: Pretty darn good. A pot of tea with free refills is about $5."}
{"text":"Endroit qui ne paie pas de mine de l'extérieur, mais très confo et relaxant à l'intérieur. Tout le monde est très calme, il y a des sofas, le monde reste aussi longtemps qu'ils veulent..
Il est toutefois possible de discuter, si pas trop fort
Grosse sélection de thé, ainsi que scones, muffins et macarons qui avaient tous l'air délicieux!
Très bon service
A essayer!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best tea house I have been to. They have a really big list of different tea, they serve delicious dessert and the staff is super nice.
You can easily find a plug to charge your computer and your Iphone, people are nice, if you are a student its a great place to meet other students or just focus on your own thing."}
{"text":"Great place to have tea at night. Wifi is on and chairs are very comfortable. Very cozy place  in town."}
{"text":"Chai Tea Lounge, or as the regulars call it \"Chai,\" has pretty much been my second home for the past year.  The ambience is wonderful and they have 2 rooms that I found have different dynamics-- the front best for studying while the back good for catching up with friends.

You can choose from a huge variety of teas prepared in quite a few ways, or coffee of course.  They also have some DELICIOUS scones, cupcakes, macarons, and other snacks.  In addition, you can order a meal from their sister café, El Mundo, which is right next door.  I'm personally a big fan of their warm bubble tea and the brie avocado sandwich with pesto from El Mundo :)

I'm going to miss this place once I leave Montreal!!"}
{"text":"One of my fav study spots and it's not far from campus. Really good drinks, snacks and sandwiches. I recommend a matcha bubble tea with half coconut syrup and half sugar cane. Only reason I'm giving 5 stars is because the wifi is really spotty. If you need internet, beware, it gets frustrating!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to drink tea! Try the scones, a delicious bread served with a little touch of butter and jam, huge variety of teas, great service and the faster internet I've used in a coffee or tea place."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. The bubbletea were light and airy to the taste. Loved the matcha, lavender and rose flavours."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea but definitely over priced. 

Worth it though if you stay to enjoy the nice atmosphere and fast internet."}
{"text":"Almost a 3.5 if the internet had been a little better.

We visited on a quiet and rainy Sunday afternoon/early evening. Perhaps because it's June and past university exam season, the cafe was relatively empty - with maybe a dozen customers in it. There was only one girl behind the counter doing everything from taking order, to making the drinks and food, to cleaning up after guests, so things could get a bit slow from time to time. In addition to their teas, lattes, and bubble tea, they also have an assortment of food items - sweets (cupcakes, macarons), salads, soups, and sandwiches. I settled with a Chai latte and opted for the Pumpkin spice chai, as opposed to regular chai as the base, which was $4.25 + tax. It wasn't that special, I found the drink almost a bit watery and lukewarm. I would definitely try their teas next time since the teapot set looks so adorable and seems perfect for an afternoon of studying. 

There's plenty of seating in the front and back room and a very clean washroom in both rooms. There are both regular chairs and tables for traditional studying/laptops and also long sofas and comfy chairs more suited for a bit of chatting and relaxing. Just ask for their wifi password, but personally, I found the wifi a bit slow and also flickering. It could be a nice place to get some work done, since it seems to be relatively quiet and does have many outlets."}
{"text":"Brilliant, modern decor with very welcoming atmosphere and lots of really comfortable seating. Excellent selection of teas and excellent lattes too. Very good selection of pastries, especially small cupcakes. Great service too."}
{"text":"Great cafe for working! A good amount of background noise and a comfy atmosphere. I had a pot of tea for less than $5 and it's unlimited refills (though I only refilled the pot once). My friend got a drink + cupcake combo and the cupcake was also delicious! Slightly pricey but I guess you're also paying to use the space to study. Got quite busy at one point but eventually died down during dinner. Will come again!"}
{"text":"The cupcakes served at this place were amazing - appropriately small for the dense caloric content of the ingredients and simply wonderful.  I would recommend the cookies/cream (oreo) cupcake.  

The tea itself I surprisingly found lacking.  I had one of the tea lattes and found the flavor of the tea to be watered down, perhaps it was not steeped appropriately like a chai to concentrate the flavor?"}
{"text":"j'ai habité à Cupertino en Californie ou il y a des dizaines de boutiques de milk tea au mètre carré, autant dire que j'ai pu en essayer beaucoup. en plus de ca, j'ai travaillé pendant un an dans ce genre de café et c'est au Chai Tea Lounge que j'ai goûté le meilleur bubble tea. je conseille le peach ou litchi green tea qui sont tous les deux très bon, ainsi que les lychee jellies ou tapioca comme topping! je reviendrais évidement."}
{"text":"Un salon de thé confortable et peu achalandé en ce mercredi après-midi d'été. Parfait pour lire le journal et des revues sur un bon sofa ou discuter avec des copains.

Bon choix de thés glacés, chauds et de bubble teas. J'ai essayé le thé blanc bai mutan. Un goût d'algues assez prononcé et un peu amer, plus thé vert que blanc à mon avis. La théière est 4,00$ plus taxes, ce qui n'est pas donné, mais ce pot donne trois bonnes grosses tasses de thé et on peut partager.  

On peut aussi acheter du thé en vrac, des accessoires, des macarons et des pâtisseries pour accompagner notre boisson chaude préférée.

Pas cheap comme endroit, mais très relaxant et calme. Super si vous êtes dans le coin et sûrement mieux que les chaînes genre Tim Horton!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot with a selection of desserts coffees tea etc
Great location walking distance from most of downtown
Delicious macroons!!!"}
{"text":"Si vous cherchez un salon de thé dans le Ghetto McGill pour lire ou travailler, c'est la place pour, y'a du thé/café, des macarons/cupcakes, wifi gratuit et déco sympa + sofas/fauteuils confos !"}
{"text":"This is a cute coffee-tea lounge which is perfect place if you need to find a place to work or study or meet with friends. I'm not a coffee drinker, but their tea selection did impress me a bit. Their Long Island green strawberry tea is delicious and smells amazing. Yes, definitely would come there again."}
{"text":"Ginger Mango Black Tea, oh so refreshing!

I love how they make all the tea from scratch when order and no sugar is added!

Salon de the Chai Tea Lounge is such a nice surprise. 

Friendly staff, chill and cozy environment and of course tasty beverage!

Highly recommended if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Went there on evening of Monday for studying.
The place was filled with students. Decently quiet environment and fast wifi.
Would come again!"}
{"text":"Studying with some bubble tea? Sounds good to me or so i thought...The bubbles are sometimes way too rubbery/hard, and there ALWAYS seems to be this slight moldy smell from the cups. Not to mention, there is wayyy too much foam on top so that the drink is literally 1/3 foam. I couldn't finish the last one that I got when bubble teas are one of my favorite drinks..

Aside from that though, I come here often to study because it has a nice vibe and it's pretty relaxing here! They have nice treats like pocky, macaroons and even scones here! I LOVE THE SCONES. I usually take the cheese scones and they heat it up too and it's amazingggg!

This place is especially busy during exam season since a lot of students come here to study so it does get pretty cluttered and sometimes a bit dirty but otherwise it's pretty decent, get the hot teas, scones or cupcakes! They're pretty good! If you want good bubble tea go to chatime--literally 2 mins from this place.
Still, would come here to study and relax!"}
{"text":"Cool cafe with lots of space (and college students on their laptops).
Rus and I hung out here while waiting to check in to the place we were staying.
They serve lunch sandwiches, interesting pastries (biscotti, muffins) and a GREAT assortment of teas (hot & cold).
I ended up getting a cappuccino and it was frothed to perfection.
Great, quiet hangout with wifi."}
