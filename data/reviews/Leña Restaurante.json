{"text":"Such a disappointment! We were excited to try this restaurant and it was far below expectations. 

Have to say first that the room is lovely - it's retro and yet almost eclectic- but freezing cold by the window. The service was pleasant but once the wine arrived we sat and sat ..... and sat. People on both sides of us (who arrived well after we did) received their food while we waited for appetizers. Finally the waitress told us the kitchen \"forgot\" our order and it was on the way. My husband had the olives and pickles - pickled onions, not cucumbers. There were biscuits and crackers and bread with it. I had the broken avocado salad - almost flavourless, I didn't bother to finish it. Tip to the kitchen, I don't want to fuss with cutting up my salad. And dumping smoked paprika on half an avocado didn't add anything much. My husband had the brisket burger - forgettable, he said the best part was the fried potatoes. I had sea bream with TWO kinds of potatoes and some half mushed up peas, I ate the fish, pretty much left the rest. I didn't even finish the Pinot Grigio - which never happens. 

Not going back. The star is for the decor."}
{"text":"3.5. I've been to Leña for both brunch and dinner. I would recommend Leña for brunch -- they have a great menu, and the prices are pretty readonable. However, I don't recommend their dinner menu -- while I really enjoyed the vegetable escabeche as my appetizer, the mains (the trout and the chicken) really should have been $7-8 cheaper. For the price of those mains, I could have gotten better dishes. So, in short, good for brunch, not so much for dinner."}
{"text":"I came for dinner for Winterlicuous with two friends. 

The décor is stunning, the green sofa on which I was sitting very comfortable but the place was overcrowded with tables. In my opinion when you can see clearly the people on the table next to you, the tables are too close to each other. Also about the washrooms, we had to take a lift to the floor below, really??

Our server was very attentive but for the food he recommended, I will just quote one of the other reviewers who wrote \"my level of enjoyment did not match the price tag\".

Details about my food:
1. Caldo Verde (kale & potato soup, chorizo, picual olive oil) - very plain with exactly 2 thin chorizo slices. 
2. Caballa à la Plancha (seared mackerel, tomato, piquillo pepper & matane shrimp ragout) - a small portion of slightly overcooked fish - nothing memorable. Again, what was the purpose of the ham pieces on the top of the mackerel? What about a person who chooses fish because he /she does not eat pork.
3. Ciruelas Borrachas (drunken prunes, brandy, saffron brittle, crème fraiche) - just OK but nothing special. And I don't recall the saffron brittle very well. I regret that I had not order the cake but I went with the server's recommendation.
4. We shared a bottle of white Argentinian wine - Torrontes - that was really great! Very light and the pineapple flavour was surprisingly pleasant. 

I don't think I am coming to come to eat in Lena restaurant again but I will definitely come for a glass of Torrontes after shopping! And I will be also checking the Torrontes selection in LCBO - my new favourite wine now."}
{"text":"I went with my friends for the winterlicious menu. When we arrived we were seated right away as we had made reservations. The atmosphere is quiet but the tables are quite close and you can easily bump into people's chairs and tables if you are not careful navigating through the room. The service was a bit on the slow. We had empty dirty dishes left at our tables for a while before they were taken away. We tried all four different appetizers and I would say that the lamb cappacio was the best one. I had the ensalada which the biggest in portion. For entrees we got the pork shoulder, mackerel and clam pasta. The pasta was good and filling though it was too salty. The pork shoulder was good although the components didn't seem to go together. The mackerel was good and probably the small dish. We ended with getting the almond cake and dry prunes. Overall it was a nice meal although they could turn a notch down on the spices."}
{"text":"I had a good time at this restaurant. Firstly it is much larger than it appears, there is a dining area and private event rooms upstairs. The decor is catching with the whole Art Deco, gilded age theme. The staff was mediocre, our oysters which we were supposed to share before the mains were brought after the main dishes were served, and I had to catch the attention of the guy bringing it myself after I saw him walk to 2 other tables asking if they order oysters.

The food was good, I had the octal and it was very rich, tons of pasta in it. Oysters were fine as well. It's a nice lunch place for after shopping"}
{"text":"We were there on Friday for winterlicious lunch. The restaurant was busy, but shouldn't the restaurant expect a high turn over based on the reservations? Our main course didn't come after 20 minutes of the starter. People arrived after us received their food before us. Our waitress didn't even ask the kitchen until we talked to her, twice. We had to pack up our main and dessert to go. The waitress didn't apologize (understand it was not all of her fault), but on behalf of the restaurant shouldn't she express some sort of empathy? We were even debating if we should tip or not. Food was fine. To be fair the ceviche is delicious. overall the restaurant need to out more effort on customer service."}
{"text":"Was here on a Wednesday night with two of my girlfriends. I would say the restaurant was full but not as busy as I have seen it on some evenings when there is only standing room available. Got a table and initially were told that we may need to vacate because there is a reservation. Julian the manager is amazing he came to say hello and introduce himself and realized that there may have been a misunderstanding and confirmed with the hostess that we didn't really need to vacate.  He did this in the most pleasant non awkward or official way it almost felt like we were in his house and he was inviting us to stay longer for the evening. He's an amazing fellow! 

Our server just as great he was always on point and around when we needed him. Glasses never empty nothing ever missing. I should mention we may have been a little rowdy and laughing but never did we get one of those weird looks or stares and not even from the patrons around! 

Food is tapas style and is just absolutely delicious. The salted cod and the \"buratta\" salad with sweet potatoes is so good. Highly recommend. 

In summary, Lena is a place with amazing atmosphere where you can go with a date girls night, after work,  or just grab a drink at the bar to enjoy their Art Deco Great Gatsby decor. Delicious food and service that by far exceeded our expectations! 

Thank you Julian and the rest of Lena staff, I'm sure you'll see us soon."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Friday evening with my hubby and another couple. The place was busy and the decor was great. That about sums up the positive aspects of this place. The moral of this story is that O&B on the high end is not worth it.

Between the 4 of us we had the beef tartare, salmon, the lamb dish, steak and a veggie risotto. The food was fine but really nothing to write home about. The service was terrible. Our drinks came after the appetizers and dishes were not always brought out together so that you could all start eating the same course at once. The waiters were so well trained that they waited while you, the guest, made space on the table for whatever they were delivering. Real amateur hour, which was surprising for a spot where you will easily spend $100+ per head on forgettable fair.

Perhaps the cafe area is better. The restaurant, the cafe and the lounge downstairs were busy so perhaps this place is still just coming into its own. However, we will not likely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Friend of mine recommend this place 
She was in a group with us and we got there 7:30 
Took them good 30 min just to come to our table and see if we would like to have some drinks 
Service wasn't good (basic ) at all 
Foods on a menu weren't available to order so after spending 10-15 min to decide then we had to reorder and we had to catch a show and already told them we need to be out of there by 9!
I'll give service a 0 
After paying out our bill we asked for a manager and this Russell guy ( \"manager \" ) doesn't know what costumer service is .. 
As a local foodies don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"We had a bunch of appetizers including tuna, sea bream and ceviche, and for entrees had the chicken and veal and all were excellent as was the wine, the service and the decor!  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night I went to Leña to celebrate my 24th birthday wiht co-workers and my girlfriend.
I had gone for the first time on Wednesday with friends for some tapas and wine and had a fabulous time and our server brought me a surprise birthday dessert at the end of the meal so I got up at the end and asked the hostess if I could reserve a spot downstairs for my party of 10.
We walked down and chose a nice spot with some booths tucked away in the corner so as to have our own private area.
Upon arrival the hostess told me it was all ready and to head down, so I made my way downstairs only to find that there was no table ready. The spot I had picked out was full of other people as they apparently had a Lost Craft event going on.
I was upset. I could have gone anywhere for my birthday and it was actually my first birthday in Toronto since I just moved to the city a few months ago.
I went back up and told her what I had seen and she apologized and said she would try to get me something and I told her exactly how disappointing it was.
Then I walked right up to a man who was clearly the manager and asked to speak with him privately.
I told him everything and immediately he apologized, got me a glass of sparkling rosé while they sorted it out and got my reservation back on track.

When I walked down he came around with a bottle of champagne, and glasses for all my friends, offered us sparkling water and then our server came by with plates and cutlery and about 20 minutes later all of these appetizers arrived at the table.
The restaurant is pretty pricey, each one was probably about 20 on average.
They brought out about 6.
He came around and told us about each dish, and then made sure we had any other drinks we wanted.
After having lots of delicious craft cocktails and a few shots we were so content and ready to enjoy the rest of the night and then out of no where the manager appears with a platter covered in candles and desserts with \"happy birthday\" drizzled out in chocolate. 
I could not believe it. Then someone else appeared with two of their churro desserts and I was dumbounded.
Then to top if off they came back with a bowl of ice cream and a brownie with ice cream....I couldn't believe they gave me this many things to make up for the beginning of the night.

We spent the rest of the night in good company eating good food and having amazing service.
Although the beginning of the night was not so perfect that manager really did his job and went above and beyond what I would have ever expected. Those dishes, and champagne (plus he brought out some sherry wine for dessert!!) probably added up to 100s of dollars.

I wish I knew his name, I'm sure I'll be going back there and I will thank him again and get hims name but shoutout to him and the management team for picking him because he literally made my birthday.


Thank you so much!!
I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The main course (rabbit and snails) was my favourite. With the empanadas as an appetizer and the potatoes you will savour every bite. Absolutely loved the ambiance, music and a nice decor can go a long way. The desserts are not very good however. Didn't like the churros and the flan. Not sweet enough and you could feel the oil (churros) and the egg (flan)."}
{"text":"Very yummy food, but spotty service.

We had a late brunch one Saturday after 2pm.  Made a reservation, though I don't think most people bother.  It seemed like walk-ins were seated pretty quickly.  I ordered pan de miga, my wife revuelto.  Both were finger-licking excellent.  We split a chocolate & dulce de leche tart for dessert, which was also good.

The staff was all super polite and welcoming, but they seemed inexperienced or confused.  When we asked for the dessert menu, the waiter first began to tell us what they have.  But then he seemed to change his mind and went to bring us the dessert menu, from which we ordered.  And then he brought a neighbouring table a dessert we didn't recognize from the menu.

When a server brought us our dessert, we were short a set of cutlery.  We asked for it, and she brought us a knife and a fork... to eat ice cream with. :)

There was a corner table next to us, and two different sets of diners occupied it during our visit.  Both actually complained of being neglected by the waitstaff.  I wonder if there was a miscommunication between different waiters about who would cover the corner table that day.

A word to parents: there are no changing tables in the washrooms; plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner. Had the veal carpaccio for appetizer, chitarrine a la amatriciana for the main course, and almond cake for dessert. Food was tasty, but nothing too unique. Service was good too. This may not be my top choice for dinner, but this could be a good spot for drinks because of the ambience."}
{"text":"A beautiful one-of-a-kind place to dine and enjoy some cocktails.   Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious and cocktails were reasonable. But for tapas incredibly expensive . $3 per piece?! This stuff is free in Barcelona . I was absolutely starving after. Come for the drinks but go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance, great service & wonderful food! The restaurant was already pretty busy at approx 6pm on a Tuesday. Dined downstairs in Bar Lala. I ordered all of  Kevin's (Server) suggestions. Had Veal Milanese as entrée. I could not believe the size of meal, I had enough to take home for dinner next evening. Burnt cheesecake dessert was delectable. I can't remember the last time I had cheesecake that actually tasted like CHEESE! All in all it was a lovely experience & definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday brunch and it was amazing! We had the tortilla, revuelto, crepes and the empanadas. All were great and the mimosas were fab! Service was splendid and our server even surprised us with a little treat with candles for me to blow out! She was amazing! Beautiful decor and ambience!"}
{"text":"I came here for the $28 Winterlicious menu for 2017 and I must say Excellent food and very fair portion, however what made me give a one star is the terrible service they provided. 

Everything went very well until our entree came and everything went downhill.

The waitress poured sauce all over my purse and all of the sauce on the plate of the mackerel was gone. She just left my friends dish in front of her making the plate extremely unpresentable and she did not insist on getting a new dish for her. The waitress proceeded to get a dry towel (keep in mind this is oily sauce) and very reluctantly and provided a sloppy attitude of wiping my purse which did not go away. We asked for a damp towel and she still did a very mediocre job on assisting me with my purse. After a couple of minutes, the waiter did not ask me if everything was alright and left my friends unpresentable dish there so I told him I would like to speak to the manager. Once the manager came, he gave a very monotoned and short response. He did come back with another mackerel dish but said nothing about my purse. At the end we did get our sparkling wine reimbursed but the process of not handling the situation professionally ruined the experience. It's a shame a high class restaurant with great food would provide such service to their guests."}
{"text":"4 out of 4 dishes were bland, would not visit again.  Service and ambience were fine."}
{"text":"*Visited October, 2016*

Leña is a restaurant with historic roots: the hidden, nondescript entry to the Hudson's Bay led into venue with décor that highlights Saks' art deco accents. The designers gave birth to a beautiful octagonal, marble bar that acts as the centerpiece. The leather upholstery, velvet booths, brass lamps, and two-storey windows, accompanied with the original stained glass and grand staircases all give Leña a unique flair. The main level seating feels slightly cramped at the booths, which is why they have two more floors with private and semi-private dining rooms which you can explore.
Being a new restaurant, there's bound to be hiccups in the services at Leña regardless of how cheerful and bubbly the gentleman and ladies are. Being escorted to our seats, our waiter was extremely attentive and offered suggestions on the style of eating (tapas vs. mains). The only two slips were being told there was brunch offered everyday (miscommunication?), and water spilling when being poured and not cleaned up thereafter.

Quail Eggs: They're served as adorable little bites, topped with an amazing piri piri sauce. While they were undoubtedly creamy and delicate, more celery salt or heat from the jalapenos would have been appreciated.
Charred Beef Tartare: Contained lots of flavor, dusted vegetable ash is where the misleading title comes from. The raw beef came with a raw quail egg. The texture of the meat was further softened by the creamy umami-packed oyster mayonnaise. The fennel bizochos added a great crunch and as we felt that they didn't give enough initially - you can ask for more! Personally, I would have preferred less of an airy texture from the bizochos.
Pan de Miga: Since when did sandwiches become so pretty? The iconic and crust-less sandwich is a staple across Argentina. Traditionally, it contains just provolone and ham, but that's where Leña gets creative. The combination of flavours with the green olive relish was a delight, as well as the perfectly done toast.
Poached Arctic Char: Presentation was lovely: the warm corn and tomatoes, followed by the leafy greens and arctic char exemplifies comfort food. The char was seared to perfection, pairing moisture with crispy skin, offering the slightest resistance when digging in, and garnish for a fresh twist. The creamy corn and fregola on the bottom were also great, and the texture was a mouthful of fun. Overall, lovely dish but personally felt it needed something fresh/cool as well to balance out the rich flavours of the dish.
Pollo Doña Aurora: One of Lena's signature dishes. The flavours surpass the ingredients and the meat braised to perfection. Incredibly juicy, it pairs perfectly with its rich sauce. Could have been more depth - maybe a touch of acidity. 

Leña is a safe choice. Most dishes were great, but hardly memorable, and were modified for the western palette - so be wary if you're looking for true Argentinian affair. The price reflects the high-heeled shoppers and business clientele of the area."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Appetizers were tasty..got the peppers and empanadas. However, my cabonara pasta was bland and dry.  Not sure if I would go back to try other dishes. Quite pricey."}
{"text":"I was hoping to try their Winterlicious 2017 menu but when I arrived, I was told that the Winterlicious menu would not be available until 11:30AM (this was not stated on their menu or on their website). When we asked if we can wait until 11:30 to order our food, the waitress came back saying that the table was reserved for 12:15PM. We then ask if they would be able to serve the food in 45 minutes and they said they can't guarantee that so we ended up ordering from the regular lunch menu. 

The food was very disappointing considering the price of the dishes. The breakfast empanadas were very hard and seemed like it was over baked; the chimichurri did not stand out and there was very little of it. The Seville orange crepes had too much syrup which made the crepe very soggy and sweet.

As for the service, the waitress kept coming back asking if we wanted drinks and brought our bills when we did not ask for it. Also, when we left, there were still tables available and at 12:30PM, the table was still empty.

Considering the subpar food and terrible service we received, I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Loved the Decor. But the food wasn't good. We shared a bunch of small plates. Although everything came out fast. It was clear it was pre-made and reheated. The croquettes were overheated. The cod fritters were gross. The salad was nice. But $18 for a salad was a bit steep. If you want good Spanish tapas please try Bar raval or Patria! It's much better food and not has pricey!"}
{"text":"Great decor and location but overpriced for what you get. Lentil soup was a bit bland and watery. Salad lacked creativity. Budget 2 hours for your work lunch as the wait staff seems overloaded."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7.5/10
Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 9/10
Service: 8/10

The food at Lena is good, don't get me wrong. What I am finding hard to swallow is the price point.

I met a friend for dinner and had 1 cocktail and 1 entree, resulting in a final bill cost (pre-tip) of approximately $50. I am not beyond spending that much on myself, but the food will need to blow my mind to make it worthwhile. 

The rest of the experience was good. The server was accommodating and the inside is really quite stunning. We were seated in the second floor area which at the beginning of the 6:45 reservation was a bit vacant, but filled over time.

PRO TIP: when making a reservation, ask for the main area (the one you can see from Yonge/Richmond). If you don't, you will likely get seated in another area.

THE BOTTOM LINE: there is nothing glaringly wrong with the food or the experience, but you're paying a lot and it is not quite worth it."}
{"text":"If I can go back in time I'd walk right pass this place. I am sitting at the table right now and honestly the only positive thing about this place is the wifi...

We ordered capiroska and Caesar for drinks and my 4 year old nephew could've made them better. They both taste disgusting... The waiter couldn't even give proper recommendation for drinks and just had pretty bad attitude - I have worked in the service industry so I'm pretty generous and understanding of bad service but this was unacceptable. 

Not coming back to this place. Won't recommend for drinks."}
{"text":"The 1-star is mainly because it took an hour for our appetizers to arrive which ruined the whole experience for us. 

We came here for lunch and the place was busy but not packed. Given that we ordered off the standardized Winterlicious menu, I couldn't think of any reason for such a long delay. The table next to us (who arrived later than us and also ordered after us) were already finishing their mains by the time we got our appetizers.

Food was okay and flavours were different but honestly nothing to write home about - and certainly not worth the price tag. First floor decor is nice but that doesn't really matter if you're seated on the second floor in oversized chairs that makes the whole space unnecessarily cramped. Service was alright and they at least allowed us to pack our main and dessert to go but it meant that presentation was a solid 0/10. 

This was probably the worst Winterlicious experience I've had to date. If I had known this place would be so incredibly underwhelming, I would have just walked the extra block to Eaton's Center and go on a shopping spree instead."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good and attentive, ready with menu details and recommendations if you're looking for it.  Had the grilled shrimp that came with a side of about 8 mini Yukon potatoes, and the taste of the dish was just fine, but the cook on the shrimp was sketchy. 

At first I thought it was just me looking too carefully at the doneness of the shrimp, but realized about halfway through that some of the shrimp were *just* cooked (with the meat not quite firm, the heads still being a bit goopy in texture, and the shells having tinges of grey). There were at least 3 which were completely grey-shelled on the underside, which I had unfortunately missed until after I ate it (too enthralled with my date! :). Not great, considering there were only 8 shrimp on the plate to begin with. Not to mention extremely precarious as a pregnant lady - especially when the seafood wasn't sashimi-grade nor meant to eaten raw. 

Was luckily just fine after the meal, but it was a scary enough experience for me to lose trust Lena's kitchen and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicous lunch with coworkers. Excellent job on the appetizer and dessert, but the kitchen really screwed up the main course. Ordered pan seared fresh tuna, what eventually arrived at the table appeared to be overcooked canned tuna...."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with friends. I had a yummy egg and potato quiche style dish and a pastry with an americano and mariquilla (passion fruit juice). The service was extremely friendly and the inside of the restaurant is quite beautiful with a very authentic south american feel to it. 

The pastries/snacks I had from the breakfast menu were ok, on par with starbucks' baked goods, nothing exceptionally mind blowing. However, based on the breakfast food I had, I would return to try the lunch or dinner menus."}
{"text":"never experience this slowest and non professional service. Food is average but very slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww like a turtle"}
{"text":"A 3.5 would be more accurate. 

My bestfriend and I came here as she heard good things about this place's interior ( she's an interior designer..) and she unfortunately regretted her choice. We had cocktails and a few share plates. First we had the croquetas and the empanadas..both were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I really enjoyed the  stracciatella though! The hand pulled mozzarella was perfectly balanced with the freshness of the greens, the citrus from the celementine and the sweetness from the sweet potato. I would recommend trying this if you come here. The cocktails on the other hand were pretty standard. Service was super friendly, though we did always have to wait a while to get our server's attention. Still my bestfriend did leave this place feeling robbed she said. The food just wasn't good enough to justify the price. I don't think we'd be back anytime soon. --The interior was nice though ;)"}
{"text":"We only had drinks but found the decor and service to be very nice. I don't think the place knows what it wants to be, the decor and location support the expensive cocktail prices and yet the limited beer selection is actually quite cheap. My suggestion would be stick with the quality cocktails and improve the beer selection or remove it all together."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, good service, but mediocre food. Lunch menu was particularly small and not enough selection for a quick one hour or one hour fifteen minute lunch."}
{"text":"If I get the opportunity, I'd give this another chance, but I wouldn't suggest it.
45 bucks for a lunch size pasta and a cocktail. Cocktail was good but a no brainer. Service was slow but good.
I had the ricotta canelloni. Sauce very green pepper heavy which I happen to like. But the pasta was gross. Tasted like it was over cooked 3 days ago then recooked and over cooked today. Noodles and cheese were indistinguishable mush. Bleh. And a small portion. Not even close to worth the price tag. Was like a lean cuisine with a fresh sauce on top. Anyway, that was only one dish so they might have redeemable offerings, but for this first go, no thanks. 
Restaurant is beautiful. Decor made for Instagram much like Oretta."}
{"text":"You expect good service when you go to an OB restaurant, so we weren't overwhelmed by the sincere friendliness and attentiveness we received (although we did really appreciate it because of course it's not something you get everywhere). But we really didn't know what to expect with the food - we've eaten a wide range of Latin cuisine and honestly had no idea whether or not we'd enjoy ourselves at Lena. This being our belated Valentine's Day though, we had high hopes!

Chef de cuisine Julie Marteleira has put together a menu that has variety, class, and elements that will educate and inspire anyone with even half a stomach (if that's even a thing!) We were lucky enough to enjoy several dishes, including the empanadas, the crab fritters. the iberico ham, the seabream tartare, the rabbit, the canneloni, and the churros.

I'm no food writer, so suffice it to say that the detail and love put into the dishes was exceedingly evident. Maybe we were swayed knowing there's inspiration from grandmothers and family recipes, but it really did feel like we were eating a dinner created with a caring and nurturing hand. The ambiance and decor really fit as well, making us feel like we were indeed in Argentina in the '50s or '60s.

We honestly haven't had such a well put-together meal in a restaurant that was also so authentically charming and lovely. I will mark this down as one of my best restaurant experiences!"}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch with a friend and a few of her co-workers. Great food and friendly service but our server seemed to be super sweaty and it was a bit of turn-off. It was a super hot day, but it would have gone a long way for him to pat a towel on his forehead."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious $48 three-course dinner as the restaurant is a new addition this year. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff are all dressed up in matching outfits. 

An important point to note. Upon looking at photos of other customers who went to Winterlicious earlier, the plating was what caught my eye. They used plates with elegant blue floral designs. I was disappointed as I only received a plain white plate for my dessert. The man beside my table received the blue plate that I kept seeing in the photos, he ordered before I did.

We ordered the following:  

App:
- Dorade Ceviche (milk aioli, lime, sepia dressing, escarole, shoestring potatoes)
This was the best dish. The fish was fresh and nicely paired iwth the sauce. It was also topped with shoestring potatoes (which reminded me of Hickory sticks). 

Mains:
- Chitarrine a la amatriciana (clams, egg noodles, guanciale, tomato sauce, reggianito, chili) 
This was disappointing. It seemed like something you would get at a restaurant that prices it for cheaper. The sauce was a bit spicy but the sauce was a bit too salty.
- Eggplant Milanesa (northern woods mushroom and chickpea stew, green olives, red wine sauce)
This was interesting. The eggplant was fried and was plated on top of the chickpea stew. The flavours were flavourful, but nothing spectacular. 

Dessert:
- Candied Orange & Almond Cake (marmalade syrup, sour cream ice cream)
The cake was very dry and dense. The marmalade syrup helped to lighten it, but it was still not the best. The sour cream ice cream was unique however, and I enjoyed it. 

Verdict: I will not go back again. The food is not anything too amazing. For the price of what I'm paying, there are many other places you can go to."}
{"text":"Decor - you feel like you're walking in to a bar that you'd find in the Great Gatsby. Very elegant and chic.

The Food - it was alright. Nothing immensely memorable and for the price, I was hoping for memorable

Service -Excellent.

Overall - I would say go for the cocktails + decor and if you're peckish, stay for the oysters."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time thinking of a rating for this place so I decided to default to 3? (I mean, how do you quantify subjectiveness in 5 stars anyways?)

My friend's sister recommended this place to us and apparently Lena is all over Toronto for their wonderful Latin American food. But, the brunch? It was okay. It was fine. I got the full gaucho: leña spiced egg, morcilla, jamón, mushrooms, potatoes à la plancha, all of that fancy Latin American food? 

I don't really know what to say. I probably will not come back to the place just because it didn't leave an amazing impression on me. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of 1 star reviews of this restaurant which I don't think Lena deserves. The brunch IS quite expensive, but overall, it was filling and didn't taste bad at all. One thing I did note was the amount of oil on the plate. (There was a lot). I also thought the location was odd. It's sneakily located on Yonge and Queen, and the mall is right there too. 

If you want to REALLY try out their Latin American food, don't go for brunch, or maybe try out more of their less breakfasty-foods?"}
{"text":"Lena Restaurant is under the umbrella of Oliver & Bonacini group of restaurants in Toronto. 

Lena is located in the SE corner of Saks. It's marketing itself to be South American cuisine with a \"nod\" to Spanish and Italian tastes. 

At first glance, Lena is Art Deco inspired with opulent light fixtures and retro decor. The place itself is very nice and in particular, the flamboyant wallpaper in the lower level of the restaurant is amazing. 

I have been here on two occasions and will combine both experiences into one review as the service was not remarkable and does not account for my score. 

The first visit to Lena was shortly after they had opened and it was for lunch. A friend and I ordered two items to start and share: blistered pardon peppers and salt cod fritters. Both dishes were lacking flavor, and to note, the peppers were completely bland. Next, I ordered the ricotta cannelonni which was also bland, and disappointing. The taste was almost \"yuck\" because I knew what I was eating ... but it didn't taste like what I was eating. I'm not sure where they went wrong with this.  For dessert we shared the orange and almond cake. The cake looked good, but when we sliced our forks into it, the cake was very greesy/oily. It was saturated with oil and that was very offputting. There's one thing to have a moist cake... but this was oily and gross. 

My second visit to Lena was for dinner. After my first experience I decided to try it again, but this time for dinner as I would have the opportunity to select from a larger menu. 
This time to start I chose the Ontario garlic shrimp. I hate to say this but anyone who has eaten at the keg, has had this dish. It was shrimp drowned in garlic butter with lemon. Next, I chose the charcoal bluefin tuna. The veg on the plate were well cooked and had flavor however the bluefin tuna was very disappointing. I have had better at many other restaurants in Toronto who serve the same dish. For dessert I had the chocolate and dolce de leche tart, served with sour cream ice cream. It was very good. 

On each visit I had the rose wine from Spain which was excellent.

This restaurant is over priced and not delivering on the food as you would expect for an upscale restaurant. 
I hope they improve... but diners be warned in the meantime."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent level of deliciousness from plate to plate.  Some dishes were very tasty (the appetizers, the bread, the churros), others were rather underwhelming (the chicken, the pasta), and one salad (with anchovy fillets) was essentially inedible (we sent it back and got comped).  

Very nice, professional server and good wine selection.  Charming atmosphere.  But the food was disappointing for the price we paid.  We were treating a colleague visiting from abroad to a nice dinner and so the inconsistent dishes were a little bit of a downer."}
{"text":"For my last brunch of 2017 I decided to visit Lena . Its very spacious, coat check was a nice touch and service was top notch We weren't rushed at all and for a large group our food came out in a timely manner"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. Gorgeous restaurant, the food was very good. Empenadas were nothing special (go to Jumbo Empenadas in Kensington Mkt instead)  but the rest of what we had was delicious. Would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"After looking through a few menus of restaurants participating in Wintericious, we decided to go with Lena for lunch on a Saturday. The prix fix menu was $33 plus tax and tip, and we left with our bellies feeling very satisfied! 

The restaurant on the main floor is quite stylish, with a large circular bar in the center that had a nice coffee aroma. We were seated at the lower level, which was less exciting and there wasn't much natural light, but the atmosphere was still decent. 

For the appetizer, I ordered the Jamon Blanco, which came with a large slice of crostini style bread on the side, some flavourful cooked ham dusted with what looked like paprika, and it was served on a bed of smoked eggplant (although I couldn't taste any smokiness). There was a good drizzle of olive oil that added a slight nutty flavour to the dish. One of my friends ordered the cured sardine toast and that was also a great choice. The sweetness of the piquillo peppers complimented well with the saltiness of the cured sardine. The portion sizes were good, and the Jamon Blanco was definitely bigger than we expected for an appetizer. 

For the main, I ordered the cavatelli, which was an eggless pasta with braised chicken and cured pork (guanciale). The pasta was al dente, and I really enjoyed the guanciale and garlic flavours infused in the oil, topped with a light cheesiness from the pecorino. The chicken was less impressive as it was just chunks of dark chicken leg meat, mixed in with the pasta. My friend ordered the albacore tuna, and the coriander dressing was very refreshing. The fattiness of the fish was balanced with additions of tart flavours from the tomatillo and pickled vegetables. 

For the dessert, I ordered the quince tart with sour cream ice cream. The sour cream ice cream was delicious and rich, but the quince tart was pretty average (a bit on the sweet side for me). My friend ordered the orange and almond cake, which was moist and fluffy and went well with some prunes on the side 

Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience and found the meal to be pretty good value. The chefs were good at mixing ingredients to create balanced flavours, so I'll definitely return to try out other dishes on their regular menu."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Probably not, but it's not bad; it's just expensive.

We came here for Winterlicious 2017 and this is what we ordered in order of how much I liked them:

--1) MAIN: Bondiola y Mrocilla (braised pork shoulder & white beans, guajillo pepper marmalade, leña black pudding)
This was my favourite dish. The shoulder was so tender and whatever citrus fruit they had with it brightened up the dish. The blood sausage slice was out of place; I don't see why it was needed. 

--2) DESSERT: Cheese and Quince (spanish & italian selection)
The cheese, crackers, and the mashed fruit squares were actually delicious. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the blue cheese and quince.

--3) DESSERT: Candied Orange and Almond Cake (marmalade syrup, sour cream ice cream)
Not a fan of citrus in desserts, but I could barely taste the orange. Also couldn't tell the difference between regular ice cream and their sour cream ice cream. But the combination of almond slices with soft cake and melted ice cream was tasty.

--4) MAIN: Caballa a la Plancha (seared mackerel, tomato, piquillo pepper & matane shrimp ragoût)
At this point, there was a bit of a pattern of uninspired dishes. The mackerel was good, but I don't understand the strips of ham on top at all. That was like an afterthought. The shrimp in the ragoût didn't add much. Frankly, the potatoes were my favourite part of the whole dish.

--5) APPETIZER: Vitel Toné (charred veal carpaccio, oyster mushrooms, preserved tuna mayonnaise, pickled & raw vegetables)
The veal was quite bland, but the sauce and this dish as a whole was much more flavourful than the crudo.

--6) APPETIZER: Dorade Crudo (milk aïoli, lime, sepia dressing, escarole, shoestring potatoes)
This wasn't bad, but it was boring. The flavours were kind of muted and \"shoestring potatoes\" were pretty much hickory sticks. The textures were nice, but it was a little lackluster. 

The restaurant is nice, but it reminds me a lot of Dineen, the coffee shop a little further south. The food was paced perfectly, with the next course coming a few minutes after they take away our dishes. Like someone else mentioned, we did have instances where our plates were taken before we were done (and it was so quick that things were moved/stacked before we could object), but everything else was fine: we were checked up on regularly.

The place wasn't bad, but it was underwhelming. I get that it's in Sak's, but I just don't feel like my level of enjoyment matched the price tag."}
{"text":"I was concerned about taking my clients to eat here after seeing the poor reviews. However we had a lovely time. Food, cocktails and wine were excellent. We ordered a range of tapas all delicious. We didn't have to wait any longer than you would expect. Service was good from everyone who served us."}
{"text":"5 stars on the decor and space. Food was a meh. Forgettable dishes. 

Highlight: Ambience. A stylish spot downtown to meet for a drink, coffee or apps/salads."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the steak I got, juicy and right amount of fat on it, we also got the quail devilled eggs and 24 month jamon for starters, both quite good. I would love to go back and try their rabbit and snail next time."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much as it is decorated beautifully and very close to me.  However we came here for brunch and the service was not the best.  Our server seemed very clueless and out of it. My tea had gone cold and I had to wave them down for more hot water.  My smoked salmon scramble was okay, nothing special and the fare was pretty standard.  The churros were very good so thank goodness for that.  Another weird thing is that for such a classy looking place they were playing hard rock?  Are they trying to be the next Hard Rock Cafe?  Maybe?  Anyway I will give this place one more try for dinner and then after that give it up altogether."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend. The selection was pretty slim, but as I have not gone to these restaurants, I would assume that this was normal.

Overall, the food was very tasty. The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the combo of the fried hash on the salmon was amazing

I was not a fan of the blood sausage. I have never tried it before so thought we should. It was not for my taste.  Everything else was pretty good.

The atmosphere was pretty good as well. A casual place for a slow weekend morning. 

Overall, I would go back"}
{"text":"The stars are really for the décor. The main room with the bar is stunning. The colours, the architecture...art deco. Amazing. The service, from wait staff to management was also very pleasant. 

The food - Sorry to say, subpar for the prices they are charging.  The croquetas were dry on the outside and not crispy to the bite, again for the $14 price tag, not worth it. The shrimp main - $27 for 5 small cold flavourless prawns spread out on a plate with a sprinkle of asparagus and a side of boiled baby potatoes. A little creativity, please. The flavours a total disappointment. The only saving grace were the empanadas ($16 for 3 small pieces). Shame that the food is no comparison for the beautiful surrounding. 

If I were to return, I would sit at the bar for a cocktail but wouldn't eat."}
{"text":"4/5

Disclaimer: based off the Summerlicious lunch offering 

Came on a Sunday afternoon, around 12:15. Some of us were late for our initial reservation but they were accommodating and we were able to move the time back. The location is very accessible (right from Saks or off of Yonge). 

Ordered the following: 
Veal Carpaccio (App): Veal was nice and tender, and plenty of peppers and onions to match with it. Server recommended this one so thank you! 

Albacore Tuna (Main): Expected a bit more flavor, but the tuna was nice and light, complementing the salty taste of the potato.The vegetables were relatively chewy. 

Panqueques (Dessert): The glaze on the crepe was nice and sweet. Would have made for a 5 star desert if there was ice cream (or something similar) to pair with the crepes. 

The portions were quite big and I found this to be the most value out of my summerlicious ventures. Service was friendly, enthusiastic, and kept joking how we were lucky to make it to the last Summerlicious serving! I don't usually eat South American but am interested in trying more in the future after this."}
{"text":"Located right inside Sak's on Queen street. Atmosphere of this restaurant is beautiful. Very modern and artistic. Upon arriving, there are two sets of doors you can enter through. One through Yonge/ Queen Street and one through Sak's inside the Hudson Bay. Host was friendly and brought you to your seat quickly. One interesting fact: Lena actually has 4 floors! Some reviewers had already mentioned it, but the little space you see through the windows of Queen and Yonge is deceiving. 

Upon being sat down, my server took quite some time to come. I thought it was because my other guest did not arrive yet, but even after she had arrived it took her almost 15 minutes to come by and take our order. When she did, we opted for the winterlicious menu. The menu itself is quite diverse but the food at best was mediocre.

We started with the cooked veal carpaccio and the ceviche. The carpaccio was overly salted but the veal it self was cooked well. The ceviche was my favourite part of the meal. It had a tangy taste with a sauce that resembles pesto. They also sprinkled a bunch of hickory stick chips ontop to garnish... quite interesting.

For the main, we opted for the mackerel and the spicy tomato egg noodle. Mackerel was cooked pretty good but it was small. It was also on top of a bed of tomato/red peppers... once again. quite salty. The spicy tomato egg noodle seemed like it was just spaghetti and tomato sauce with a little bit of calabrese. Once again, OVERLY salty.. but the noodles were cooked well. 

For dessert, we had their cheese plate (one hard and one soft cheese with some apricoat and mini baguettes), and also had their candied orange and almond cake. The cake itself was quite tasty and the cheese were generous.. could not finish it. 

Overall though, the service is what knocked all the stars down... after every course we waited 20 - 25 minutes for the next course. This is ridiculous, especially since they are catering to the financial district employees... The server we had was also very slow and didn't pay much attention to her area (we noticed other tables were also annoyed at the slow service and incompetency of the server). It's sad that a O&B restaurant has this kind of reputation. One fun fact though, we saw one of the Masterchef Canada judges Michael Bonacini at the restaurant.. seems like he was fixing some visual of the restaurant rather than cooking at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks after our movie and loved the atmosphere! The bar is soo beautiful and the food menu looked delicious! The bar tender was very friendly, it was excellent customer service. I highly recommend coming at night time as this place has a magical, enchanting feel inside!"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious. Let's just say the food is sooooo underwhelming. I'm quite disappointed in this O&B restaurant. For a place that is sitting next to saks fifth and with the prices set high, this place truly does not deliver. 

The tuna from the appetizer tastes like canned tuna. The veal was bland. The pork for the entree was decent. The cake at the end was dry. I know this is winterlicious, but if you can't impress your guests now then they won't come back to pay more to try the regular menu. Cooking on a budget doesn't have to mean bad food. And for a Latin American restaurant, I would expect flavor to be more bold, yet everything were bland. 

Service was slow and cold. Servers didn't seem like they want to me there, took no time to explain each dish, and reaching over everyone's arms when clearing the table. If you are going to go the high end restaurant route, you have to do better than this. 

Sadly, the only thing that I like about the restaurant is its Art Deco interior. High ceiling, upholstered leather seats, nice floor tiles."}
{"text":"Lena specializes in South American food. The atmosphere is upscale chic. The decor of the restaurant is gorgeous - great use of Art Deco. The service is attentive and friendly. 

I have been here several times and I was never disappointed. I was there for brunch during my most recent visit.  I ordered \"The Full Gaucho\" which came with lena spiced egg, morcilla, jamon, mushrooms, potatoes a la plancha. The Full Gaucho was essentially the breakfast with an Argentina twist. It was delicious and filling. I would recommend leaving a little room for the churros dipped in the Soma chocolate. 

The cocktails were creative.  While I did not sit at the bar during this particular visit, I enjoyed sitting at the center bar on a prior visit. It is fun to people watch from the center bar. There is a New York vibe to the bar - it could be the Art Deco design that gives it that 30's New York feel. 

Overall, Lena is an enjoyable restaurant. It is pricy for what it is, but not so pricy to be unreasonable."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have known this restaurant can be assessed from inside of Saks.  Opening the door, you stepped into a lively crowd , a contrast to the quietness in Saks. The restaurant has its main entrance from Yonge street, it was not immediately obviously where we should go to get seated but we found our way.

The staff were thorough and knew their menu, if they weren't a bit slow. We had the steak and the winterlicious menu. Both were delicious though I think the steak, from their regular menu, was done better than the winterlicious one. Could also just be we didn't order the right items on the winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful Bar with mediocre food and service... the first bartender took 10 min to come around and when she did she offered if I would like a glass of water. I accepted while I looked over the menu. Then she disappeared and a second bartender came to take my order. My French martini was made without chambord and polar Ice vodka yet it was priced for 15 dollars plus tax..will not return."}
{"text":"Like many others, I came here with friends for Summerlicious dinner and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back. 

I had the salmorejo soup (which I don't usually find at all restaurants), pork loin (which was so juicy and delicious) and a cheese plate to cap things off. 

My friends and I walked out with full bellies and were not rushed out the door at all as we sat for a bit after settling the bill. Lena also has lots of seating with a lower level area as well (I had initially thought it was what you saw at street level). 

Will definitely be making another visit back!"}
{"text":"Went this past Saturday for brunch and had the best burger I've had in a while. We also ordered the toast and the poached eggs which were all delicious and prepared with impeccable flavour pairings. The staff were wonderful - just the right amount of friendliness and very knowledgable about the dishes. No pretentiousness which I love to see in Toronto.  Recommendations were on point with what we were looking for. I agree with other reviewers about the beautiful modern art deco structure and finishings. Will consider Lena for a private function in the future. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised as the reviews regarding service on Yelp weren't that great. The only problem with service we experienced was with the hosts - the lady who served us couldn't find our reservation, didn't smile at all, and made it feel like it was our fault that she couldn't find our names. However, our waitress was very enthusiastic, provided us with great service, and we enjoyed the rest of our experience at Leña.

We ordered only starters to begin with, as the food on the appetizer menu interested us more than the mains. We intended to order our main after but by the end of our appetizers, we were actually quite full.

Quail eggs - I like quail eggs, so this was good, but there was absolutely nothing special about it. For the price, I wouldn't order again.

Clams - delicious but a little bit on the salty side.

Salt cod - nothing special. Pretty much just fish on a layer of hummus.

Leña Stracciatella - Absolutely divine!! Who knew a mix of house-pulled fresh mozzarella, sweet potato, and honeyed clementines would taste so amazing! This was the highlight of my meal.

Monbranca (cocktail) - essentially a mojito.

Many of their dishes came with bread on the side and I really appreciated how they actually used different textured bread to complement each dish appropriately.

Given that we only ate appetizers, our bill ended up being quite reasonable. (~$100 only before tip)

I would come back to try their mains."}
{"text":"The two stars are really for the decor, which is stunning. Sitting there is like taking a trip in time. 

I went there on a Saturday morning and ordered the tortilla and a lemon curd beignet. For a Spanish influenced place, the tortilla was really subpar... On the other hand, the lemon curd beignet was delicious. I would've definitely ordered a second one after that bad tortilla but I didn't feel like spending more money. I've been told the brunch is good but after that tortilla, I'm not sure I want to give their brunch a try."}
{"text":"Back for drinks and light eats before a show last week. We had appetizers quail eggs, shishito peppers, beef tartare, shrimp ceviche, stratitelle. Mojoto cocktail was excellent. Only thing I didn't like was being seated in the busy street level area and they had the windows open late evening which made it too cold. May weather isn't really ready for open windows. Also the metal arm chairs scratched my leg and I wasn't comfortable. Didn't try dinner entrees this time."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best, HORRIFIC service.  The fact it took 40 minutes to get the tartare and cod fritters brought out to the table was simply unacceptable, but the kicker was that our server kept coming over to ask US where our food was...um, hello...isn't that kind of your responsibility?!  He was abrupt, scatter brained, and I'm sorry, when a customer asks for your menu suggestions, don't recommend an item you haven't actually tried. Furthermore, when you mess up your customers order, don't just leave the plate on the table and walk away, and then make the customer feel like a criminal and accuse them of not communicating clearly.  I had brought my girlfriend here for her birthday celebration, but we didn't even bother to order mains and just wanted to get the heck out.  This place is an embarrassment to the O&B family."}
{"text":"Services is excellent. The place is stunning but the food is not worth the price. It's far from Argentinian food. I won't return there"}
{"text":"I love snacking here!!!! Came on Thursday for after work munchies. 

I had the pan bread (just butter and bread), blistered padron peppers and empanadas. I asked for their aioli on the side to eat with the padron peppers!

The drinks are definitely over priced :("}
{"text":"Food is good - unique menu with some classic O&B flair but the service is awful. This restaurant is not inexpensive and the service was unlike anything we've ever experienced at a high-end restaurant. We were forewarned by friends who had a similar experience - they said \"the food is great but service is horrid, we won't return unless someone else is paying for it.\" We had dinner at Lena last Saturday evening. We had a 7:45 reservation for 3. When we were greeted by the hostess, she barely spoke and didn't offer to take our coats, we asked if we could check them. She seated us at a cocktail table beside the bar. The table was cramped and the restaurant was less than half full so we asked if it would be possible to move to a proper table. The server obliged. When the server took our drink order, we ordered a few appetizers while we perused the entrees.  Two of the four appetizers were delivered in a reasonable time. Two were missing. The server said they would be back with the other two. After 10 minutes the server asked if we'd like additional drinks, we ordered another cocktail and asked about the other appetizers. After a few minutes she returned to the table, apologizing, saying the appetizers would be out momentarily and we would not be charged. She forgot the cocktail we ordered. Another server brought the second set of appetizers to our table - one we had ordered and one we hadn't. We pointed this out to the server. They left and returned with the correct appetizer.  Our entrees arrived a few minutes after the appetizers were served. Still no cocktail. The server asked if he could remove our appetizer plate that was clearly not finished. The server mixed up our entrees and gave the rare steak to the wrong person. Not a biggy - easy to switch - but again, not what you expect from a $400 meal. When we left, we approached the hostess station - she hardly acknowledged us. We held out our coat check token and a young lady asked if she could get our coats. We asked the hostess if that was the manager, she indicated it was. The manager returned with our coats - she was pleasant but said nothing, didn't enquire about our meal.

Regarding the food...we ordered the salt cod fritters, charred rapini, shrimp and empanadas for apps. Strip loins and organic chicken for entrees. The steaks were prepared beautifully. The chicken was delicious but had too much sauce - it was smothered. The appetizers were delicious. I loved the empanadas. 

The food is well prepared, of fine quality and delicious. However, there are plenty of fine restaurants in Toronto that offer better service. 

The staff are all quite young and obviously inexperienced or unaware of the level of service expected in high end restaurants.  We get better service at the Keg. We can't see this restaurant lasting if they don't address the service. Unlike our friends, we won't return regardless of who's paying."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night and the tables weren't filled. I think this place would be better of you approach it for drinks and tapas rather than dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a Friday night Campari and whiskey having walked passed it all the time. Completely disappointed by the drinks. They whiskey had to sips worth in size. And the Campari not much better. Expensive too. Interiors are nice but we won't visit again. Especially with places like Richmond Station across the road."}
{"text":"Talk about a disappointment.

I love going out to restaurants at work and have experienced some truly fantastic meals in the downtown core. This place was not one of them.

We ordered the empanada, brisket burger and sea bream. Empanadas were over-fried and dry. Brisket burger was ok. The most boring and unimaginative burger I've had in a while. I didn't have a chance to try the fish but the impression was also mediocre.

Here are some other problems. Your napkins left white lint all over my black pants. Thanks. After the empanadas, the server took the dirty forks but put the dirty knives on the table next to the clean forks. This is completely unacceptable. The staff were also missing that friendly and gracious attitude. 

Last week I went to the restaurant at Nordstrom. What a difference. Who ever reads this I urge you to go to Bar Verde in Nordstrom instead. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is lively, and the staff is incredibly nice. Pusateris also opened up, they are better too. I will be spreading the word around the financial community that this restaurant sucks."}
{"text":"Leña had amazing service with great food. Maybe the hype I had heard didn't live up to my expectations or maybe the price was high on comparison to other places with almost as good food. Beautiful location and decor and again, service was impeccable."}
{"text":"After hearing many good reviews and blog articles about this restaurant, I decided to come here for Winterlicious lunch with some of my friends. A relatively new restaurant still, Lena is located near the Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto and connected to Saks By Fifth. Its two floors and when you walk in, you notice the nice design of the restaurant. It was quite busy when we came here for lunch. They had drink specials so I ordered the Granda Smash which has rum in it. It was good. For the Winterlicous lunch, I ordered the Dorade ceviche with milk aïoli, lime, nasty sauce, shoestring potatoes, Pork Bondiola which is the braised pork shoulder & white beans, guajillo pepper marmalade and the Candied Orange & Almond Cake with Marmalade syrup and sour cream ice cream. My only thing was how the food was served to half of my friends while my other friends had to wait a bit and flag the waiter down so that he noticed not all the food was served at once. Loved the ceviche with the rich flavours and seasoning. I enjoyed the pork shoulder as it was cooked nicely, very succulent and juicy and fatty which the way I like eating pork. The almond cake was decent and wasn't too sweet. Overall, a nice dining experience at a new restaurant. Highly recommend it if you are near the Eaton Centre looking for some good Spanish eats!!"}
{"text":"If you like pretty decorations and nice artitictures, this is the place. But do not come here if you are hungry.  The food comes at a pace that is way too slow: there is a 20 mins waiting period between the Finish of the last course and the next, meanwhile you are just sitting there. No one from the restaurant is even acknowledging this is a problem (they are not even making eye contact with you). It does not help that the portion size is also on the smaller side. 



Now the good (normal) part: The place offers modern twist on south American cooking, with plenty of wine and liquor to choose from. Decors and artiticture is the hilight of the place. Food is a bit too salty in my opinion. The flatware for appetizers and desserts are pretty unique and fun to look at, definitely complements the dishes. 

Service is pretty decent, although they do pay more attention to larger tables."}
{"text":"had empanadas, sword fish ceviche, patatas bravas, and rabbit + snail rice.
.
not sure what to say man, it was all very basic.
i feel like the rabbit could've at least been de-boned ... that was a struggle to consume.
food was dissonant with the great decor and service.

washrooms were stellar. very nice. +1 star for washrooms."}
{"text":"Came in around 2PM for lunch on a weekday, it wasn't full but there were couple of occupied tables. I always wanted to dine here as they have beautiful decor and was excited but slightly hesitant as to why this place only had 3 stars on Yelp. 

We started off with the broken avocado salad and the quail eggs. Then for entrée we had the carbonara and calamaretti, finished off with egg white flan. Now.. the eggs were just boiled eggs with some mayo sauce on top and the avocado salad was more dismantled rather than thoughtfully broken down decoratively. Both tasted fine but lacked finesse. For entrée I had some dietary restrictions and had to tweak the dish a bit. Our server took every word carefully and the chef executed it perfectly 100%. I really appreciated that and would've given a 4 star.. but leña lacks that 'umf' in their food in both flavour and presentation. The chic art deco bar in the centre with the tall lamps are definitely beautiful but that's it. Oher then that, from the dinnerware to the layout of the restrooms.. it was subpar. Overall it's an okay restaurant but I wouldn't be coming back as there isn't anything I'd particularly miss especially at that price point."}
{"text":"Lena is part of the O&B group so can be confident with the quality and service.  Our server was as expected very hospitable.  The food was good I wanted fish and the server suggested the trout which I found to be good.  Also liked the steak very tender and juicy."}
{"text":"It seems a lot of the reviews are based on Winterlicious experiences, my review is based on my experience dining here on a regular night. The obvious: the decor is beautiful- right down to the plates they use to serve the food. I came here a while back to evaluate the venue for a company party, and I highly recommend booking with Lena if you're looking to impress and save money, you can't beat the value! It's comparable/less than some other higher end spots in Toronto, but the decor here really sets a higher end ambiance. Onto my review of the food- I must disclose, I chose safer options, I had the pollo dona aurora and torta de queso. The pollo dona aurora was well executed, the side dishes complement the moist and tender chicken. The torta de queso's concept sounded interesting but it was a bit too sour (I know, there's citrus in this, but it could've been a little bit less so that it wouldn't overpower the cheesecake)."}
{"text":"First time here and I was disappointed. I tried the Tagliatelle Carbonara and it was extremely salty, I wish I sent it back. My boyfriend had the Ricotta Canneloni and the egg noodles ended up being soggy and not what you want when you order canneloni. The 2 good things this place has going for them: good attentive service and their Chipas buns. With lots of restaurants in the area, I don't think I'll be coming back here for the price and food quality."}
{"text":"Went to Leña for my birthday the other evening. First off the decor is so striking and stunning, you walk in and are immediately impressed. 
Since it is a brand new restaurant, there are as to be expected, a couple of hiccups in the service, but we were a large party and overall everything went smoothly. 
The food is absolutely fantastic. At first glance it's a little pricey but trust me it is well worth it. The small plates are very small and maybe not what I would suggest to go for but the appetizers and mains are excellent. Some stand outs for me included the blue fin tuna which was superb -very clean and really showed off the fish, the sea bream ceviche (which is party of the seas good tasting) and the lamb with goat cheese crema -all of these dishes were absolutely incredible.
I'm celiac and the servers took the precautions to make sure I only ate what was safe for me, warning me of any possibility of cross-contamination -there was one mistake where one server told me something was safe for me to eat and when it arrived the other server ran over and said it wasn't. The disaster was avoided so I'm okay with that haha. This is definitely a place where you treat yourself, don't expect cheap and cheerful but the food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious and the food and service were honestly just okay. Nothing that spectacular and worth another visit. While their decor and tiled flooring is pretty, their seating is quite odd, and I ended up on a half-couch, in which I couldn't really see the person I was eating with. Service was a quite abysmal and slow, as we sat with dirty dessert dishes for 15 minutes before getting the bill. The food was well-done with solid ingredients, came out warm, and properly seasoned, but not worth a regular visit in my opinion. It is on the louder end, so while its quite pricey, it is also a somewhat casual atmosphere, likely not the best for formal old-school business meals."}
{"text":"The food is very good overall, but some items are pricer than expected.

Lena is the newest addition to the Oliver & Bonacini empire, and is located at Queen & Yonge, in the Saks Fifth Avenue/HBC building. The restaurant is beautiful and modern, and surprisingly large with a semi-private dining room and a larger dining area upstairs in addition to the front area. The food is South American, which is a welcome addition to the Toronto food scene. 

We got the following dishes:

SMALL PLATES:
- Smoked Jamon Croquetas ($12) - delicious little morsels, but you only get three of them.
- Gaucho Empanadas ($13) - tasty beef empanadas
- Salt Cod Fritters ($11) - these were okay, wouldn't get them again. Again very small serving for what you pay.
- Patatas Bravas ($8) - these were great

APPETIZERS:
- Burrata ($19) - did not enjoy this burrata! It was overpriced and too soggy.
- Heirloom tomato salad ($16) - a few tomato slices for $16, way overpriced.

MAINS:
- Chitarra with octopus, malbec, bone marrow, fava beans ($29) - this was quite good
- Rabbit & snail rice ($34) - quite good
- Striploin ($44) - surprisingly this was the standout dish of the night. The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and came with a delicious chimichurri sauce. I honestly think this steak was even better than some fancy steakhouses in Toronto.
Polo Dono Aurora chicken ($27) - another great dish

DESSERT:
Churros with soma chocolate ($12) - delicious

Overall, I would forego the appetizers, get ONLY the jamon croquetas and patatas bravas, and focus on the mains."}

{"text":"Review, in short: fantastic food/dessert/drinks/ambiance executed with 2 star service. However, I chose Lena's restaurant & planned a special Mother-Daughter dinner here two weeks in advance so I had high expectations & Lena fell really short. 

First I made a reservation two weeks in advance & requesting a corner table seemed to be no issue at all when I placed the reservation. It just seemed strange that on the night of the dinner when I called an hour ahead to confirm the reservations were sorted out - that it took five minutes to find and confirm reservation details...of course, I'm thinking my worst nightmare has come to fruition & they lost my reservation & now I've got to scramble around & find another restaurant. Thankfully, they found it & nerves were eased & then I brought up the issue of the corner table to which the lady suggested that we go into the private dining room. Oh, private dining room you say? Well yes that sounds divine. The sound of private & secluded sounds great to me. 

However on arrival they sat us in this strange tight booth against the wall in the center of the room. It was super uncomfortable and I knew right away that I was going to ask to move. I love a velvet booth just as much as the next person but not when I can't move my elbow & I'm trying to chat face to face to my mom & you know, eat my food. Seemed like a simple request but whatever. 

So Mom arrives. They do not offer to take her jacket - small things that irritate me at a high end restaurant. If you are going to take mine please be consistent. Then there's a good 15 minute wait to get any service. I'm starting to rethink this whole \"private dining\" area & cursing myself as 1st of all the private dining room was in fact quite cramped - beautiful, albeit, but cramped and fairly loud for a private dining section. 

So we wait another 5 minutes on top of the 15 to finally get a server over. The first server was a disaster. Eager to finally get service, we swiftly ordered our drinks, soup & entrees then I made a polite request to move to one of two corner tables. He later came back & denied that to which I reminded him of the other table in the corner & he left to double check again & upon return w/ only 1 of 2 drinks he hum'd & haw'd & did the whole \"mmmm i don't know, seems like a lot\" song & dance then finally succumbed to going 'over & above' to help us - the bleeping paying customers - feel a tad more comfortable & switch us over. While he's doing that my mom is clearly agitated & mentions that the 9 oz of wine she ordered in fact was about 5 oz - yep, she's right. SMH. 

The server now has totally succeeded in getting under my skin so I knew then that the tip was going to be pretty light & I assume that he knew too because after the move two tables down he quietly decided he didn't want to continue serving us. The new server assigned to us was clearly just as confused because he asked us why we hadn't been served any water at the new table and when I asked if he was our new server he said he was just helping out with the tables. Ok - lol. More smh. Whatever. We eventually all realized that he was going to be sticking around for the long run since incompetent server #1 had somehow fallen off the face of the earth & I never saw him again. No need to tell us that we are getting a new server- don't worry about any professionalism - none needed over here. Thanks for caring. New guy serving our table is a nice guy & everything you would wish your server to be like - friendly, considerate and professional. I don't think the calamity of mishaps that ensued afterwards & long delays of service had much to do with him as there was likely a lot of confusion RE: who is actually taking care of our table? 

Soup is served by one of the kitchen helpers. Ah nice, looks good, first real meal of the day, I'm thinking. No offer of cracked pepper - odd, but even odder is that we had no spoons to eat with nor table serviettes. Sigh. I finally get the attention of our server and he brings them to us. 

Well, thankfully the Lena cocktail begins kicking in for me & my Mom opens her gifts so we're having a good time. I decide to order a 2nd cocktail & as it's taking so long to get service, I decide to do a little test. I know holding a menu is a subtle sign for servers to approach the table but that didn't work so I fully held up the menu (arms-up)for a good 3 minutes. Being passed & ignored by so many servers I'd had enough & finally decided to bring the issues to the manager's attention (Russel). He was very professional and empathetic -a nice guy. But offering another glass of wine & cocktail on the house just doesn't cut it. I was furious when I realized this was the only adjustment made to bill & that the pretty card he gave me was not a gift certificate but in fact a promotional flyer. 

I do not recommend private dining here
The food was great but at the cost of almost ruining the night? Is it worth it? You be the judge."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to catch up with friends! We came here based on a recommendation from one of my friends. Originally, we wanted brunch (which was unavailable on weekdays) but stayed for lunch nevertheless. 

The restaurant was very classy and the service was great. I ordered a Broken Avocado Salad and although I'm not really a fan of beans, I enjoyed them with the dish. The avocados and tangerines were an excellent addition!

The only downside was the price. The meal came to a total of about $38 after tax and tip (and chicken is an additional $8). Overall, it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"People can be critical of the O&B empire, but hey... they do things right. :)
Lena is lively, colorful, and serves great food. The sardine toast appetizer could easily be my daily breakfast for the next year... so good! 
Winterlicous can be hit n miss, but it really delivered here. 
Plentiful portions, lots of choice, and the service was on point. 
Recommend the pear mocktail if you are keeping it dry right now."}
{"text":"Pluses:
Loved the decor and the ambiance 
Good service
Cocktails were great
Bathrooms!)

Minuses:
Was not very happy when we got the bill)

The food was fine, but not great. We only ordered appetizers as we weren't very hungry. It's a nice spot to have a drink or two but if you want to get some good food you better go somewhere else. And yes, as other reviewers mentioned it's expensive.
Would've given them 4 stars if either the food was better or the prices were lower)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and the restaurant was already pretty full (but no lineups). The atmosphere is very comfortable and great for a chat with friends. 

I don't think there was anything special about the food tbh. The portions were pretty decent but the taste wasn't anything special. Seems too pricey for the whole experience. 

Servers were friendly but didn't care much. Seemed to be understaffed since it was hard to ask for something.

Oh and the churros...don't recommend getting them since they just taste like flour drenched in oil. Every single bite of it had oil spilling out."}
{"text":"Had after work drink and some small dishes. The first floor is extremely loud even though it is not crowded. There are 4 floors, basement is a special event lounge and 4th floor is private event as well. 
The second floor has a more dim lighting. 
The service is excellent. The non alcoholic pear apple drink I ordered tasted very good, the pork belly is tasty. 20 day aged smoked ham is decent. Spanish dumplings are biggest and tasted alright."}
{"text":"Remarkable and delightful. Our meal was wonderfully presented and the flavors blended perfectly. We started with the peppers and the salted cod fritters from the small plates, then enjoyed the shrimp dish and the veal. Both were perfectly prepared and presented. The staff was attentive, personable - lovely. Camilla provided us such wonderful dialogue and provided explanation and suggestions at every turn, but was not overbearing at all. Perfect again. We enjoyed a moment with Chef Julie who gave insight into how they created the extraordinary blend of flavors. What a great first meal in Toronto this trip. We believe it will be very hard to top! If I went backtomorrow I'd be happy to recreate the experience in its entirety! Well done, Lena, and thanks so much for a very memorable evening! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The interior of Lena is simply stunning. Very art deco, especially the gorgeous central bar. Came here for brunch on a Sunday, and had the mushroom omelette, which was very good. However, service was slow."}
{"text":"O&B newest restaurant! Named after Anthony Walsh's mother-in-law Elena. The food and service was amazing! I highly recommend it! There are not a lot of prominent South American food restaurants in downtown! Heard about this place from a friend and decided to try it! 

We order the Oysters, Arctic char and Beretta farm Striploin. Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was so attentive!"}
{"text":"Date night atmosphere with mediocre but overpriced food.  Totally forgettable until you check your wallet afterwards."}
{"text":"THe first thing you notice is the central architectural detail. 
It's such a beautiful space. 

Took the opportunity to come for brunch and happy I did just to say I finally made it here.

Now keep in mind, this menu is definitely not typical. The South American influences here are what will make you read through each offering in more detail. I ordered the full gaucho: leña spiced egg, morcilla, jamón, mushrooms, potatoes à la plancha. 

 Biggest disappointment is how this meal came cold. You can see it in the photo of the full gaucho. I may have liked it more if there was some heat. The funny part is the servers that brought them to our table holding plates with clothes as if they were warm or who knows maybe for sanitary reasons?

Despite that I was hungry so it was filling. What  surprised me was the vinegar base as part of the eggs. I was not prepared for that. I enjoyed it after I got used to that bite of acid with the egg. The potatoes accompanying everything were kind of 'meh.' Not very appealing.

Loved the atmosphere and am rather curious of the other dishes because again it's not a typical brunch menu which is good. At the same time I wasn't overly thrilled by it. The coffee was not too good which for me is incredibly important for a morning start.

Second dish: NORTHERN WOODS MUSHROOM OMELETTE
sautéed greens, shoestring potatoes, provolone, tomato jam
This too was okay. I can't say it was something that I would order but glad my curiosity was satisfied. 

I would try it again for dinner but not brunch."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and delicious food. My friend and I both had the wild keta salmon with smoked paprika and it was so delicious! Churros were wonderful as well. Definitely recommend! Also, be sure to check out the lounge on the lower floor."}
{"text":"After reading a review of this place in Toronto Life where it earned Top Ten New Restaurants for 2016, I sought this place out while my wife went shopping.

The small footprint of a restaurant, on the corner of Yonge and Richmond inside the Saks Fifth Avenue store, is gorgeous.  22' ceilings, brass appointments surround an octagonal bar that is the showpiece of the venue.

Floor to ceiling windows flood the place with natural light and enhance the ambiance accompanying the Bose ten speaker array which pumps out interesting jazz-esque music. Interesting art adorns the north wall.  Everything feels good here.

The food unfortunately couldn't live up to the surroundings, despite the impressive looking menu.

Quail's eggs to start were great- adorned with chives and a small amount of mayonnaise.

I had the brisket burger which was unfortunately lacklustre- the accompanying potatoes were very good. The burger came with charred cucumber, but  pickles or tomatoes may be a better option to a very dry burger.  Brioche bun, and hearts of romaine couldn't lift this dish beyond mediocrity.  My wife had a King Crab and egg scramble which was too spicy.

Eight craft beers on tap.  The Bloody Caesar I had was too spicy for me, with fairly basic accompaniments.

A really nice place to watch the world from- I was hoping for more from the food.

Service was quite good."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to grab brunch, this place is new and the interior design looks so fancy. 

The restaurant is beautiful, we sat at the lower level. 
However, I was disappointed with the food... I order the Burger from brunch menu. The dish looks good but the burger itself barely has any tastes.... 

I want to love this place, but the food is not so good. Not sure if I will go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a Winterlicious lunch; we showed up a bit earlier than our reservation so had to wait a little bit until our table was ready, but this gave us a chance to take in the beautiful, airy Art Deco bar.  My meal started with the crispy, peppery rúcula salad followed with fideos--a flavourful vegan \"paella\" with capellini, piquillo pepper, charred leeks, almond & garlic aïoli.  It's from the Winterlicious menu but I hope they add it to their regular repertoire. My husband enjoyed his rustic and homey cured sardine toast and the well balanced layering of flavours in the albacore tuna. We shared the pastfrola and orange & almond cake, which was served with some syrupy Malbec prunes. Our server was friendly and we enjoyed chatting with him briefly about his travels at the end of our meal. We like Winterlicious as a way to try out a variety of restaurants; we'd definitely come here again for their regular menu."}
{"text":"I went here for a date night. It's really lovely -- not too formal and beautifully decorated. The service was excellent. It was also very busy so I recommend reservations. We had tons of things. I recommend the beef tartar and the lamb shoulder. I do not recommend the Rabbit with small rice -- neither my husband or I could handle the taste of the Rabbit for some reason. Despite that, I am giving it a 5/5."}
{"text":"Overhyped. If the only good thing I can say about Lena is that the architecture is captivating, then that's a big problem since I don't go to restaurants to admire the place. For while the interiors were beautiful, I was quickly turned off by the curt service (it was busy but I don't think that's a valid excuse) and the average-at-best food (generic at best, bland at worst). I'd spend my money elsewhere if I were you."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to Lena, it's as good as last time. I met my girl friend here for drink a a bit to eat on Wednesday night, as soon as we came in we were greeted promptly and I asked to sit downstairs this time. The music was a bit louder in the lower level than the ground floor, but still manageable to have a conversation. I love the small plates can be shared and try different items at the same time. Drinks also delicious too. Must try the hot peppers (not spicy at all) and cod fish balls, Empanadas are out of this world, I can't stop. All and all, beautiful restaurant, price is reasonable in Downtown core, like the location, service is always good. I will comeback to try their brunch. :)"}
{"text":"Nice place, courteous staff, and most importantly, great food. Must try if you enjoy tapas. The quails eggs and the smoked salmon croquettes are really good! Also well located."}
{"text":"Welcome back to a taste of the 30's Art Deco era. 

Beautiful small but lively restaurant/bar. 

I was treated for a birthday lunch and when I walked in was immediately greeted and escorted to my table. 

The male staff was friendly and dressed in a modern yet fashionable way. The female staff were in dresses. 

The menu 

Interesting options with several pasta items, a bit of seafood a steak and of course a chicken dish. 

I choose the steak and yucca friends with the dip. 

The steak was good but needed a bit of salt. 
The yucca fries were delectable!!!!!! The best yucca fries ever!! Perfectly cooked, warm on the inside and crispy on the outside. 

My friend had a delicious salad and fish cod fritters which were also very tasty. 

For dessert we shared a Flan. Not your typical flan that were used to. 
The table next to us was intrigued and thought it was an angel cake or lemon meringue. 
It was interesting but tasted like eggs w sliced almonds. This I wouldn't recommend to ppl who had enough eggs for the day. 
And definitely not if you are expecting the typical flan were used to. Maybe this was a \"Spanish\" version. 

The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. For this of us who remember that section as being the exit of the Bay, I did remember it as that when I would look up the stairs. However the bar area in the middle is just beautiful with the older lights and marble bar top, high comfy roomy stools and a step bar for your feet along with a purse hanger under the bar. The details of what makes a place inviting. 

I would suggest that they get some sort of blinds for when the sun does come through for ppl sitting against the sunlight. 

Overall, great place for a lunch outing with your friends or colleagues. Great staff, and pleasant atmosphere. 
I wonder if they do brunch? ;)

Oh one last thing it is quite pricey so make sure your up for that. But then again comparable to other restaurants of the same caliber. 

Buen apetito amigos !"}
{"text":"masterfully designed to echo the best elements of the art deco period and its premium corner location. Yes its a cacophonous, loud space but exciting at the same time, especially for the holiday season. We snuggled in whispered secrets over the din of the others and enjoyed. The veal sweetbreads with salt cod was perfectly cooked and scrumptious. I really could have done without the cod as its saltiness tended to overwhelm but was prepared - I asked for lemon....would have been great to have a wedge of roasted warm lemon on the plate. Unfortunately, the overzealous waiter was on us like flies at every turn and made it known he needed to cash out by clearing the plates so each one passed by our face as we tried to talk.
I would go back if I didnt get him again. My friend had the chicken which was good but not exciting"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing decore. The raw tuna was sweet and salty. Drinks were made generously and the atmosphere was lively. Great lighting downstairs, perfect for a date."}
{"text":"Was recommended this restaurant for a couple of different people, so was excited to check it out.  The decor was fantastic, and the bathrooms were decent as well.  Yes, I'm the kind of person who judges a restaurant based on its bathrooms.  The food was passable, not as great as I thought.  We had the salt cod, chicken, rabbit and small rice, and churros for dessert.  The churros were a bit larger than expected.  Most likely would not return unless there are no other options around."}
{"text":"Found out it was highly rated by Toronto Star. Reserved a table for 2 to celebrate our anniversary. Service was actually very good. From booking hostess to server to other very attentive staff who look after you. Food, however, I'd have to say was not impressive for me personally. Not going into details here but just nothing was special enough to mention for its'  creativity. 

Acoustics  makes it impossible to hear yourself think. Or was it just very loud groups of people we ended up sitting next to? Worth visiting and judging for yourself. But I don't think we are coming back too soon."}
{"text":"I have to say that the restaurant was stylish, staff are friendly, but there is a  disconnect. The menu is interesting, but really over priced for what you get. Why, because restaurants with the same style and price range have better service, staff that actually have a certain level of elevated service. Our waitress once we paid couldn't wait to have us leave. She continuously kept coming in to the room and restocking glasses, or plates; the underlying tone was PLEASE LEAVE. 
Don't think I would every return. 
Food and Drink Over priced: a fountain pop in a champaign glass with ice was 3.75, which is rediculous. Clams tasted good but they where a little too salty and not washed properly because there was sandy grit throughout the sauce. 
Coffee was the same, over priced 3.75 4oz cup of lukewarm warm nothing special brew. There are better, much better tapas style restaurants in town, try Patria on King!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, good service. Tasty food. But beware high prices. Party of 4. One had chicken entree said sauce was great but chicken overcooked. One had swordfish. Good but very small serving fpr $26. I shared tuna crudo, vegetable escabeche & patatas bravas with my friend. All tasty but for $42 were very small servings. Not sure we would go back, there is better value at this price point"}
{"text":"Decor of Lena is nice.  Seats comfortable and everything looked new and clean.

Caesar salad - tasty and dressing tastes fresh and lettuce was crisp and properly cleaned and torn.

Organic chicken - nice flavours though somewhat understated.  Colour of sauce was beautiful and plating was very nice.  Just wish that there was bigger flavour - there was nice taste just not enough.

Service was decent but not friendly or engaging.  Just took orders and delivered.  No explanations or suggestions or even acknowledgement.  How about even a small \"how is your meal\"? 

So price to flavour and somewhat unengaged service gets a 3/5."}
{"text":"The vibe was great. The cocktails were beautiful and tasty and the food was magnificent. Definitely get the fritters and the romaine salad. I would go back for sure because everything on the menu sounds delicious. Go with a group so you can taste a bunch of different dishes!"}
{"text":"*Summerlicious 2017 Review*

First of all go do a quick Google Image search of Leña, because I think the best reason to come here is because it is absolutely gorgeous. The interior design and layout of this restaurant is top of its class for Toronto. There are very few restaurants in this city that can compete with its design -with that said, it is right downtown so you're not going to have a stunning view of the city, like you might get at Canoe (another Summerlicious participant).

First Course: CHARRED VEAL CARPACCIO - Roasted red pepper, pickled pearl onion, jalapeño & caper crema

I am happy I went with the carpaccio. The roasted peppers and seasoning was very flavorful and the veal was tender and filling. I believe this is the most popular appetizer on their Summerlicious lunch menu.

Second Course: ALBACORE TUNA - Salt-roasted potato, caramelized onions, olive relish

I actually thought this could be more flavorful. It's probably not a good sign that I enjoyed the caramelized onions and potatoes most! The texture was quite good though. I'm not a tuna expert so take what I say with a grain of salt. If I could do a redo though, I would order the orecchiette. 

Third Course: ROASTED PINEAPPLE - Malbec syrup, vanilla ice cream, pineapple compote

I'll tell you what I told my date as I downed this sweet concoction: \"this is making me happy!\" Mind you, that might have been a dopamine rush from all the sugar, but my god this was gooooood! If you have a sweet tooth this one is for you!"}
{"text":"I wish the service had been as great as the food!!

I recently dined here with my colleagues and was excited to try this restaurant. I had previously been here, but just for cocktails.

It is a beautiful establishment with several floors, include an intimate bar downstairs, as well as an open bar and dining area, and private seating.

I was the first of my colleagues to arrive for dinner, and by 6:30pm it was already quite busy. My colleagues and I were seated on the main floor by the bar, and the area itself was quite congested due to the number of people.

To preface this, the food was great and lived up to its expectations; however, our server was rather unpleasant for the duration of the entire evening! She was quite 'short' and impatient with us in reviewing the menu and taking our orders. She did make recommendations, but only upon asking. For the remainder of the evening, the service was impolite overall.

We selected a bottle of wine for the evening that we had previously tried. Unfortunately, when it arrived, it was apparent to three of us dining that the wine had been 'corked.' We asked the server to return the bottle for this reason; thereafter, several staff members came out to our table, and in a public scene, proceeded to smell and taste the wine, as if doubting our concerns of the wine. Ultimately, they concurred (as it was quite obvious); however, my colleagues and I were left with an even more unpleasant 'taste' at how the situation was handled. We weren't given another chance to review the wine menu again before a second bottle was brought out. Fortunately, this bottle was what we had hoped for in the first place!

For dinner, we had several shared plates including the blistered peppers, the griddled shrimp, the tuna tartare, the stracciatella, and the organic chicken. We were so impressed by the quality and authenticity of the food. It was beautifully plated, and delicious! Between 4 of us, we enjoyed 8 small shared plates and one main dish, which was more than enough food.

This food and ambiance were fantastic; however, the service was quite disappointing overall. I hope that others will have a better experience in the future!"}
{"text":"Given my penchant to skepticism I stayed away from Lena for the longest time because of all the hype when it first opened. Boy was I wrong. The interior is impeccably designed, utensil choices are tasteful, it's a wonderful space to be in. The dishes we had were delectable; the portion size is moderate but the flavors left me fully satiated. But here's what sealed the deal: service. Restaurants in Toronto, for the most part, are lacking in competent and attentive service. Not Lena. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and what seemed to be a well run operation. Can't wait to return. Might up the review to 5 stars once I know the consistency is there."}
{"text":"There's no lunch on Saturdays. The service was okay. I sat at the bar. It's an upscale place that looks nice but isn't really all it's cracked up to be."}
{"text":"Tried Leña for the first time with 4 friends on a Saturday night. I have no desire to return.

Awkward, inconsistent service, and mediocre, bland food. I gave two stars only because I felt that one would be too mean.

I'll start with the positives:
*The design of the restaurant is beautiful and I love the art deco inspiration. The colour combinations are gorgeous. 
*I was greeted by the hostess immediately upon entering.
*I liked that when my cocktail was brought to me, I was told of its history  and the region in Spain (Basque) where it was/is a popular drink .(As an aside: It was basically wine and pop--not much different than what I would get as a child at all our Italian family weddings---ohhh the memories).
*Our server's personality seemed to eventually warm-up for initially being rude and cold, though he still seemed confused much of the time.
*They can bill by individual guest which when dining with a group, is nice.

The unfortunate aspects:
*The tables are placed close together. I had to be very careful that my bum didn't graze the food on the table of the couple seated next to our group.
*There were 5 of us and we were provided with only 2 menus. Like, just two our of five people were given menus! Not sure if they were short on menus but cammaaan! Being seated at the end, I couldn't see what was written so I asked for another menu. The server gave me a lengthy and perplexed look like what I had asked for was unreasonable. He then, in the most passive-aggressive way, brought me a dinner menu, AND a bound wine list, AND a bound cocktail list AND the separate desert menu (because as he snarkily said, \"some people prefer to eat dessert while the others have their entrée\"). His tone came off as a mixture of being obnoxious and patronizing and was really just plain rude. I didn't appreciate this especially since providing a menu to each guest is pretty standard. I didn't think it was unreasonable for me to ask for another.
*We started with 4 small sharing plates. Two of which we chose were no longer available. The kitchen should have communicated this to the front-of-house staff. And, if they did, our server should have let us know in advance. Not usually a big deal to be told that something is no longer available but this just contributed to the lousy experience.
*The meal was *very* oddly timed. There were a number of gaps in service.
*Our appetizers (these were different that the small sharing plates) came out with our entrées. Not sure why they're called \"appetizers\" if they arrive with the entrée.
*There were quality checks when we had the small sharing plates but no quality checks during the rest of the meal.
*We asked what ice cream and sorbet flavours were available. Our server said he would ask--and he didn't return for quite some time (yet he spent a lot of time gabbing with the table next to us). When he finally returned he guessed at the flavours then brought over another server to let us know what they were. So, he never actually asked.
*Our server came when food was delivered but didn't return afterwards and so I wasn't ever asked if I wanted another cocktail. 
*Small detail and maybe I'm just being picky, but the 6th place setting should have been removed (as there were only 5 of us) and one guest who wasn't drinking wine should have had her wine glass removed. This is an O & B restaurant and these little things should be standard.
*Our dinner plates were not cleared for some time.
*Taste and palettes are subjective so I take opinions on flabour with a grain of salt (no pun intended) but this food was bland. SO BLAND. When one thinks of Spanish and South American food they usually think of major flavour but Leña lacked this massively. I was seriously disappointed. 
*The restaurant was cold. Two in our group ate with their coats on and I was close to putting mine on too.

I feel there were two big misses: the food (which completely lacked flavour), and the service which was inconsistent.  Not sure if our server was inexperienced, nervous or just having an off-night. Sometimes great service can compensate for disappointing food, and there were ample opportunities to do that here, but they fell short.

My advice: Go for a drink, sit at the bar and take in the pretty decor, but skip the meal."}
{"text":"Last week we decided, a bit on the late, to invite a couple of friends out for dinner. Of course, all the restaurants where we wanted to go were all fully booked, but for Lena. That should have tipped me off right there.

 

The menu, which boasts of Spanish-influenced Argentinian cuisine, seemed to have potential for exploration although it was fairly limited.

 

We first ordered drinks. How difficult is it to screw up an order of Vodka/tonic and a shot of Knobby Creek on ice? Well, they did. No ice with my Bourbon, and soda water instead of tonic.

 

We started off with what the menu calls \"small plates\", which is what you and I, entitled members of the middle class that we are, call \"tapas\".

 

Call me a purist, but I think that trying to pass Shishito peppers for what the menu claims were Padrones should be ground for a public flogging. They may seem the same, but Shishito peppers are, of course, much cheaper and readily available in Toronto. But they do not quite taste the same.

 

We certainly are quite a distance away from Buenos Aires. The patatas bravas reminded us that we were definitely not in Barcelona. Where one expects a little bit of crunch, we were served chunks of potatoes that had gone quite soggy. I should be grateful that they opened a fresh jar of pil-pil sauce for us. The typical aioli you would expect with bravas was replaced with \"milk mayonnaise\", something that felt and tasted like thickened milk.

 

Tasking the salt cod fritters with salvaging this fiasco was a mistake. These four deep fried buns of bland mashed potatoes, flavored with some kind of fish - probably cod, and maybe, just maybe of the salted variety, we can't be sure - were sadly sitting in a plate surrounding a small ramekin filled with what is described as \"caper & dill crema\", essentially a tartar sauce with fancier aspirations. Yup, bland too.

 

Maybe it's me, and maybe I'm spoiled, but it's been a while since I've been to a restaurant that charges patrons for bread. At Lena, the bread is listed with the tapas, er, \"platos pequenos\". Since Lena does not boast of making their own bread, I'll assume it came from Whole Food, which would explain why they feel it's appropriate to charge 5 bucks for 4 half-slices of bread.

 

On to the main plates. We had heard great things about the Pollo Dona Aurora, and were eager to try it. I was reluctant to try veal Milanese in an Argentinian restaurant, the same way I am reluctant to order the salad when I go to Schwartz. But the table next to us had ordered it, it was just served, and it looked delicious.

 

So that's just what we ordered. Essentially, both good, but not great. Some of the pollo was a bit dry and over-cooked, but the real treat here were the mushrooms and the laurel, lemon, and saffron \"braise\" juices, which had a nice and subtle complexity that saved this dish from the mashed potatoes which were, altogether now, bland. 

 

The veal portion was generous, and I suspect they covered it with an egg to, on one hand, avoid having to deep fry it, and on the other, show how dull and grey veal meat is when you have to grill and don't want to transform it into an un-chewable slab of leather. So brownie points on that. It was tender and decent tasting. With the sunny-side up duck egg, I don't understand why this dish is not paired with some mushrooms. I was also secretly hoping for green chimichurri, which would have shown some boldness. But alas it was to be red, fully revealing the Italian influence of the dish. The boquerones were a nice touch, although I suspect they came from the same store as the bread.

 

Understandably, this is Toronto, and finding fresh ingredients may sometimes be a challenge, but in a restaurant that aspires to be of this caliber, you would expect boquerones to be marinated in house. Maybe it's me, but I blame Juan Arzak for spoiling it for me every time I eat out.

 

The wine selection is interesting, and we found a little gem in the Spanish Viognier from La Mancha. It did the job quite nicely with the pollo, acceptable with the veal.

 

The desserts were unremarkable.

 

Service was decent, with a few mistakes here and there. Fork was missing and I had to get one form another table. No milk or cream with the coffee. Water glasses that remained unattended to. 

 

A bit over $400.00 for four people, including drinks, wine, and service.

 

Overpriced, overhyped, underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I had a truly memorable evening at this restaurant.  The staff (Peter) was well versed in the history of the chef, the cuisine and even the popular dishes and was able to cater to even very difficult requests.  The food itself was spectacular with authentic ingredients (I had the octopus, wife had the salmon, and friend had the lamb).  Typically desserts are where a restaurant tends to get a bit sloppy but Lena shined through.  The egg white flan, arrollado, and churros were incredible!  Overall, a true 5/5."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner with the girlfriend on our last trip to Toronto. We were quickly seated on the lower level. I have to say, the interior of the restaurant including the lower level bar where we were seated are all really quite nice. Atmosphere was pretty intimate with a good selection of music playing.

The waiter who was really nice and helpful came over and explained the dishes extremely well to us. I ended up ordering the Rabbit and Snail Rice along with some Scotch. The food actually came out quite fast which was nice. As far as the dish itself and the taste of it, it was okay at best. Everything leading up to trying the food had my expectations set high but the dish itself was definitely a let down. The rabbit itself was not over-cooked or anything, but there was just nothing to the taste that grabbed you and says THIS IS AMAZING...which was disappointing. The rice wasn't that great either, had a super plain feel to it as if I was eating something out of a box. 

I don't mind paying $36 for a dish, but I expect it to be good at the least. So in the end, the service? Great. Atmosphere? Great. Food? Meh."}
{"text":"For the price, you can get better food elsewhere. I came for Winterlicious dinner with 2 other friends. Everything was well made but not exciting enough to make me want to come back to try the regular menu. The best part of my meal was the veal starter which had a good balance of flavors when you get a bit of each ingredient in each bite. The mackerel main was a hodgepodge of ingredients that didn't quite come together. The candied orange and almond cake was a simple way to finish off the meal.  

Overall, it was a good experience. The most notable part is probably the decor and the patterned dresses worn by the hostesses that match the patterned plates."}
{"text":"I've been here two times for brunch so in terms of brunch, I give this place a 4/5! I am absolutely in love with their REVUELTO dish. The scrambled eggs are cooked perfectly soft and fluffy complimented with the smoked salmon, some samphire and bread.  The restaurant is also beautifully decorated. I've sat both on the main level and on the upper floor which offers two different atmospheres. The service is also good and I've had a great experience every time. I also find it useful to make reservations for brunch on Opentable in advance as it does get quite busy on weekends."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this South American restaurant despite the ratings but after having brunch here a few days ago, I have to say that the overall 3 star rating is fair. 

The restaurant's main focal point is the sleek black and gold decorated bar that looks like something out of The Great Gatsby and that whole Art Deco era. I have to admit that wanting to dine here had something to do with being in this restaurant's nice setting with that bar in the background, along with being curious about the food of course. 

Speaking of the food, here's what we ordered:

Two of my friends ordered the breakfast empanadas, which was actually stuffed with meat inside and came with a poached egg on top. I would have ordered this if I knew it had more than just eggs in it. When our server was asked about what else was in the empanadas, he said that it only had eggs in it. Simple mistake that wasn't a big deal but servers should also know the menu well as that can affect what a customer decides to get. Anyways, my friends said that it tasted good enough but that the olives in it gave it a different flavour than expected and that it was a small portion. 

Another friend and I got The Full Gaucho, which seems to be one of the more popular things to order on the menu and the server said it would be heartier than the Pan De Miga which he said was essentially a breakfast sandwich. The Full Gaucho is the dish seen in many of the Yelp pictures as well. It had a spiced egg, jamon, mushrooms and potatoes. While I enjoyed the seasonings on it that added a certain refreshing element to the dish (sorry, it's hard to explain), I couldn't help but feel like it was just a fancier looking version of something that could be made at home. The presentation was nice and the dish was filling but I wasn't quite satisfied with it. It just wasn't as flavourful as I thought it would have been and didn't feel like it was worth the $19 + tax price tag.

My husband got the brisket burger which we had asked to be well done but it came out medium. I didn't feel like complaining about this and sending it back as we were starving. My husband and I usually half our dishes so we can try two different ones but since it wasn't cooked to my liking, he ate it all. He said that it was filling enough but just tasted alright in terms of flavour. He said that it wasn't anything out of the ordinary in his opinion and felt that it should probably taste better for $21. 

I also got the alfajores, which were 2 shortbread cookies filled with dulce de lece and coconut flakes. This cookie was tasty (tasted exactly as it sounds), it had just the right amount of sweetness and melted in my mouth. It was worth trying for $3.

Overall, I would recommend lowering your expectations when coming here. It's probably better to come here for drinks and maybe apps, as well as for aesthetic purposes of course. We could have just ordered the wrong brunch dishes and maybe their dinner offerings are better here? I don't know that I'd come back to try them though.

It may have also been an off day in terms of customer service as the hostess was polite enough but our server wasn't the friendliest or all that helpful. I guess I would be annoyed if I had to work on Good Friday too... 

Again, we didn't have an overall terrible experience here but it wasn't the best either. Let's just say that I can understand why the reviews for this place are mixed and will leave it at that."}
{"text":"This restaurant had amazing decor, fantastic staff and they know how to cook even with a full house. I would say the sharing plates were better than the entrees (4 of us shared the empanadas, croquettes, yellow fin ceviche and market price shrimp). So good! I may have been too full to completely appreciate my rabbit and escargot rice, but my husband appreciated it as well as his yellow fin tuna. I must have been saving room for dessert as again, 4 of us shared 3 desserts. More than enough! We had the slightly burned cheesecake, flourless chocolate torte and the churros with chocolate sauce and a hint of cinnamon we're amazing!

After dinner we went to the lower level for a night cap. The best sever! After having an all alcohol after dinner drink that I watered down, the boys wanted tequila. I knew I couldn't handle that so the server brought my friend and I water in a shot glass! So funny! I have to admit I was fooled for a second! Thought it was the smoothest tequila ever! 

Do yourselves a favour and visit Lena! The portions are generous so you might want to share small plates and save room for desert!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful. Services was great. The food is delicious. A bit on the pricey side but I guess that's expected since it shares its doors with SAKS. Great space for private dining."}
{"text":"You know when the first thing you can say about a restaurant is something about the decor means it's not a good sign, so I won't talk about the food , which was mediocre. The decor reminded me of Ceconne's in WeHo, with an Art Deco twist. The music was a little disconnected...I enjoyed the night in great company.
Great atmosphere to meet for drinks, loved the huge windows and high ceilings"}
{"text":"This place gets my 2 stars for the ambiance and great customer service.
I came here for lunch ordered empanadas for starter, Trout and an egg dish, the good presentation was Ahmazing---but the food was worse then the hot dog stand food---I am so heart broken to say this the food sucked! The drinks also were watered down. I didn't try their desert or hot drinks---I rate this place like a runway model all strut no brains."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We walked in got too much attitude. Seated in a crap spot.  We asked for a different table and got ignored. 

We walked out. 

First and last time there. There are so many good places in TO that this will be a footnote soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with its gorgeous Art Deco interior.   I didn't read any Yelp reviews prior to coming which made it a little harder to order.  Yelp reviews are usually spot on so I probably wouldn't have come if I read the reviews.

The service was impeccable but the food didn't stand out for me.  I came for lunch with 2 friends.  We decided to order a few dishes to share.   The empanadas and croquetas were good but not outstanding.  As for the cod fritters, we all thought it was only okay.  We also had their daily special pasta dish - I think it was cappelletti stuffed with ricotta cheese topped with chicken.   This was tasty and we did enjoy this dish.   Maybe we should have each ordered a main and skip the tapas or order 3 mains to share.  I also really liked the coffee with free refills which I don't often see at a nice place like this.

Given that it was a bit pricey and the food didn't hit the spot for me, I wouldn't be coming back anytime soon but I probably would give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Leña is an alternative choice of resturant located in downtown Toronto.. I passed all the time bit didn't have chance to try.  We were downtown looking for brunch on a Sunday morning.  Nothing is opened except the eggspectation which has 30 minus wait.  This is very convenience since I can access from the 5th Avenue.  We ordered a toast and a full cowboy breafash.  Omg.... It was one of the most amazing breakfast in financial district.  The southern American favor is eye opening around the area.  My cowboy breakfast is amazing with very soft texture, saute mushroom, fried egg with interesting sauce.  I can say this is the best breakfast I've had so far in financial core. If you are fan of tradition main stream 3 eggs with ham you willbe disappoint here.  But if you are a good advanturist you will love there selection.  Their southern twist is my favorite selling point in this restaurant.  In term of service, they are very friendly and attention to detail.   It is a bit pricy compare to the sunset grill across the street but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday after stopping by Kleinfield. Service was really slow, we did have a group of 5 but I still don't think that would warrant a 45 min wait for our meals. Not to mention our server forgot to ask us if we wanted anything to drink before we ordered our mains.

The menu was interesting, but there were too many items that I didn't know what they were and didn't appeal to me. I suppose it's good cause that's what makes it authentic, but I had to google a lot of the ingredients.

Mushroom Omelette ($15)
Omelette stuffed with mushrooms, sautéed greens, shoestring potatoes, and provolone, served with tomato jam and a cheese bread on the side. The mushrooms and sauteed greens inside the omelette were flavourful, but could have used more. The tomato jam was too sweet for my liking, but I guess it is supposed to be on the sweeter end since its jam. The cheese bread was really tasty, texture was super soft and spongey, had some cooked onions in it too. The dish was quite filling for some reason.

Food was okay but expensive for what you get. I supposed I had higher expectations for an O&B restaurant. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. The space and service was really nice and pleasant, but the noise ambiance is louder than we expected. It's not quite a quiet romantic dinner space, at least not in their main dining hall. 

Our server suggested a cocktail which I forgot the name now, but it was really yummy and refreshing. As for the food, these are the items we shared:

Quail eggs - it was really creamy and delicate tasting. I wished there was a bit more celery salt or heat from the diced jalapeño.

Patatas Bravas - we've been to Barcelona, so we've had many Patatas Bravas. This one sealed the deal and did not disappoint.

Chitarra (octopus, fava beans pasta) - the pasta was cooked al dente, and the sauce is very thick and flavorful. The octopus was nice and tender, but I didn't care for the fava beans. 

Rabbit and snail rice - really nicely charred and juicy rabbit paired with creamy snail rice. My husband loved the dish, especially the artichokes. The rice was a tad salty at the last few bites. 

Overall, we will be back for the service was great and the food was good!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Leña con el hermano de mis dueños. The fish fritters were quite on-point, really fresh tasting, sorta-like delicious lil crab cakes. Had the pepper starter too, quite nice, a solid rendition of an increasingly common dish. Split the beef tenderloin entreé, really well broiled meat on deliciously seasoned fava beans and cabbage. This dish was a real winner. 

¡Muy bien!"}
{"text":"I went to Lena couple of times before but never realized how big this restaurant is, I have been seating in the dinning area and it is really beautiful and cozy there. Staff are friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu, I ordered the snail rice and rabbit meat, very tasty dish and a good portion, the veal steak is good as well. They have private dinning floor which is good for special events."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place!  I've been meaning to try it out and got my chance in a Friday night around 9pm with a friend.  The decor was exquisite with an Art Deco feel and the bar where the lights were showcase and the intricate design was very welcoming for those just seeking a drink after work on their own.  

After I was sat down I waited for a friend to arrive and noticed the bartender were very attentive to their patrons and it looked very warm and friendly at the bar.  

The waitresses were friendly but the service was still not what you expected for such a high price point locale--unfortunately.  It was ok, Stepford if you will.

I had the Leña classic which was a delicious cocktail consisted of an 18 year maker's mark bourbon, fernet-branca, charred cedar,sour & scorched cherry--damn it was good! Hats of the barkeep!

Food wise we had shared the following:
LALA'S PATATAS BRAVAS
pil-pil, milk mayonnaise
This was great--not outstanding, was missing a kick to it.
DAILY CLAMS
sliced garlic, olive oil, coriander, albariño
Unfortunately only half the shells has meat, a good dish that could have been great.
GRIDDLED SHRIMP
garlic oil, chili, lemon
Cooked to perfection, I did wish we were given a lemon wedge...

We finished off with a FLOURLESS CHOCOLAtE TORTE in a Malbec reduction with cherries and dates--topped with a creme of... I forgot but it reminded me of cheese and it was such a great combination of flavours because it was incredibly rich, tart, sweet and then the flavours melted with the creme... but oh so rich!

Overall it was ok, nothing spectacular and I wished there was a bit more of a personal touch to the service since that was the biggest lacking.  It's too bad, I would have loved to say the experience was incredible but it was simply not."}
{"text":"--- Food / Atmosphere ---
It's the first time my partner and I came to eat at Lena. The hostess kindly greeted us and told us a brief introduction to the restaurant. Four floors in total (top is for private corporate events). I made a reservation for a quiet spot and they provided us a comfortable spot near the side (that was great!). 

I came here for the Winterlicious menu. $28 for 3 course lunch. They feature all dishes that aren't on their traditional menu for their chefs to showcase their unique dishes. 

App: Caldo Verde - kale & potato soup was delicious. Dorade ceviche - that was even better, tartare with some delicious sauce. 

Main: Mackerel a La Plancha - well cooked Mackerel with tomatoes. Pork bondiola - the braised pork shoulder was too dry and tough. It would have been better if it was more juicy and tender. 

Dessert: Candied orange & almond cake - delicious orange almond flavour! A little too sweet though. Ciruelas Borrachas - my partner did not enjoy the creme nor the presentation of the dish. 

--- Overall ---
Overall, we really enjoyed our dining experience here. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere inside was beautiful, the chairs were cushioned and comfortable. The food was tasty, not very memorable except the tartare dish. But we would likely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day with my boo. Ordered a glass of wine and of course the server decided the $25 one would be best for me- even though we ended up ordering the price fixe menu with wine pairings. My boyfriend spent a fortune on the bill. Every single one of my dishes had a weirdly large amount of potato so not very G free friendly. Food was fine portions were small. Too pricey but you're likely paying for the location and decor. 

Very interesting crowd too! Lol fun place to people watch that night. Was a bit bewildered by the bathrooms. My door didn't lock, very messy individual style bathrooms (get a staff member to check them occasionally- people are animals) and one of the faucets was falling out of the wall."}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance here as it's private but cozy at the same time. The food was good but the plating could use some finessing. I tried the popular empanadas, the Chitarra (octopus and bone marrow pasta) and the Veal Milanesa. The fries were surprising good and was actuallt my favourite part of the veal dish. They also have some interesting cocktails. I got the Pedro Sour which was a nice combination of citrus and egg white."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Friday with a friend after an exhausting day. We were instantly greeted by the host, who outright told us that there are no table available for two (even though there were a couple of unoccupied tables that we spotted). She suggested the bar and we followed her to our seats. As we got to our seats, the host simply put the menus on the bar and left. The bar tender rushed towards us, and screamed at the host that those seats were occupied. 
After we finally got seated it took the bartender a while to get our drinks and food order. The kitchen forgot to prepare one of the dishes we ordered and it still appeared on our bill. We politely asked the bartender to remove that off the bill since we never got it. He just grabbed the bill, without apologizing reprinted our bill and walked away. 
The food was OK, nothing special. 
I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, but unfortunately it's mostly limited to just the first floor/bar area, and the food is forgettable. When my friends and I came for dinner, we were seated on the 2nd floor, which is just kind of a dimly lit room, so that was disappointing. My friends and I shared the sea bream tartare to start, which was pretty good, but really nothing too special. It came with some sweet green tomato, lime, nasty sauce (LOL - our server described it as similar to chimichurri, except it wasn't really spicy) and potato. Then about half of our table ordered the rabbit and snail rice, while the other half ordered the veal milanesa (veal strip loin with duck egg and yucca fries). I thought the rabbit and snail rice was overwhelmingly tomato-y, and overall just didn't really stand out to me. The rabbit wasn't too dry though, which was good. While it wasn't a bad dish, there just weren't really a lot of distinctive flavours, and I didn't think it was worth the price of $36.

I'm not sure I would come back. Maybe just for drinks so I could sit by the pretty bar? But I think it's a hard pass for me for dinner."}
{"text":"Handy location, good oysters. Had the best churros ever. Don't skip the dessert. Nice ambiance, music is a bit loud though."}
{"text":"I dined at Leña with my parents and friends, and what a delight it was. The wine selection was overwhelmingly good and the menu made us want to try everything. I would certainly recommend it for celebrations or a romantic outing just for two. The only downside was an aspect of service when the server brought us the toothpicks in his hands. Having dined out in other 4-star and 5-star restaurants, I expected they would be presented in an appropriate plate or container of some sort. Other than that, excellent place to go."}
{"text":"The first restaurant that I tried in 2017!! Yesterday night, I was at this Argentinian restaurant which had a nice atmosphere and nice service. The tables were a bit too close to each other so there was less privacy. 

These are the dishes we tried: 
A. Patatas bravas - a very small bowl of fried potatoes tossed in a sauce. Good taste but not worth the $8. 
B. Empanadas - it was baked which was nice, but not traditionally the size of one from Argentina. Too small of a quantity again for $13.  
C. Iced scallops - they ran out of this and gave us a substitution of raw salmon without asking us. At the end, they didn't charge us for this small plate. 
D. Clams - decent portion of thick clams but it was salty. 
E. Chitarra (octopus) - pasta dish with pieces of octopus on top. The sauce had spice and it was pretty good. The best dish I had that night. 
F. Pollo Dona aurora - organic chicken that was over cooked and the mushrooms were salty. The potato purée was the best part here. 
G. Rabbit & snail rice - I didn't try the rabbit (not for this Cat) but tried the snail and the sauce. It was ok but not my thing. 

Overall, we shared all the dishes so that we can try more food. Verdict: I wouldn't go back. For that expensive price per dish, I'll rather go somewhere else fancier. And I hate salty food."}
{"text":"I went to Leña with a group of colleagues this past week. 
What a let down.

1 - the service was slow beyond belief.
2 - the food was good overall - but slow coming out.
3 - there were a group of servers helping  - but no one really took the lead, nor checked in to see how we were doing.
4 - at one point, they wanted to clear the table while we were still working on what was (still) on the plates.
5 - they forgot a couple of items.
6 - the waiter brought over two double espressos, one of which had one ounce of liquid in it. He tried to convince me that the cup with one ounce of coffee liquid was also a double espresso. I was baffled. 
7 - the coffee is as bad as it gets.

It's too bad - it's a really nice looking joint, with decent food. 
It could (and should) be amazing. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a bit of a whim on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch with some colleagues without realizing its Summerlicious in the city and that Leña is all up in that action. Normally I stay away from 'Licious spots during this time of year - the staff are stretched thin and sometimes the food quality is not as high. Not the case at Leña! Our server was extremely pleasant and attentive and the food was delicious. Still, I opted not to order off the Summerlicious menu - while very enticing I just didn't want that much food - but instead ordered a few smaller plates off the regular menu. And a white sangria because sangria is always a good idea. It was really tasty - refreshing and a little boozy and with a welcome touch of cinnamon. 

For food, I ordered...
+ Patatas bravas: Ever since experiencing these in Spain 10 years ago I'm obsessed with finding legit ones here in the city. These ones were excellent. Tossed in a garlicky sauce and with a nice creamy dip on the side, I could have snacked on these all day. 
+ Stracciatella: A really nice, interesting combination of flavours. This iteration was presented with marmalade, asparagus, pine nuts, and some bread. It was listed on the appetizers menu and really would be better shared than for one person. I only ate about half the cheese before finding it too rich. A group of three to four people would be perfect for this dish to share as an actual appetizer. 

Since my colleagues ordered off the Summerlicious menu, they each had desserts. We each had a few bites of the two they ordered - the roasted pinapple, and the panqueques - and oh my they were both really good. I'm not sure if these items show up on the regular menu but I would come back to Leña just for a glass of wine and a dessert after trying these. 

Final note: as we left we all commented how nice this place would be for a business lunch. Bright and colourful and not too stodgy, but efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few co-workers and I was blown away by how fancy the place looked. Do we even belong here? Although it was during the busy lunch hour rush, we were easily able to get a seat. This restaurant has multiple floors, so finding a table is fairly easy.

We started with the Lala patatas bravas. They were cooked perfectly. The potatoes were soft. It had a bit of spice kick and you can taste the fresh herbs. I ordered the ricotta cannelloni. It definitely looked different than I was expecting, but it was delicious. The cannellonis were stuffed with soft and creamy ricotta and spinach. The green pepper tomato sauce was tasty as well. But man, that ricotta was definitely the star of the dish and Leña did a great job of showcasing it. The dish was topped with even more cheese and freshly cut basil.

I thought the prices were reasonable and service was excellent. I'll definitely have to come back and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"You know what? Sometimes you just have to go for it. Kind of corporate, right in the core, but still worth the time. Looking for somewhere bright and well-designed, with food you can depend on? If so just get here and relax. We've had the peppers, the burger, salad's... all excellent. Not cheap, but dependable. This is a great lunch spot or after work cocktail. Haven't checked out the dinner vibe, but have to assume it's also top notch."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch on wednesday. We had the summerlicious menu (3 courses). I loved every single part of my meal! I had the tuna salad for app which was delicious. I've never had such a refreshing tuna salad. Whatever my boyfriend had was also quite flavourful. Our mains (chorizo sandwich on a ciabatta bun with a side of salad) was also super good. My pineapple desert with ice cream and some sort of compote was also just right. My boyfriend had the crepe and he loved it too. We weren't expecting such large portions considering we've done summerlicious af other restaurants and the portions are usually much smaller. I would definitely recommend coming here to try out their summerlicious menu. I will definitely come back to try some stuff off of the regular menu as well. The service was good too. It kind of took some time to get our meals out because they were having their lunchtime rush and the manager (i think it was the manager) asked us if we were okay for time and helped speed up the process. The restaurant also looks pretty nice too."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch during Summerlicious. Service was top notch, the food was delicious, the decor is beautiful. 

I had:
SALMOREJO (chilled tomato soup) to start - perfect for a hot day. Fabulous mixture of textures, great flavour.
ORECCHIETTE (guanciale, sweet peas, rapini, tomato) - delicious.
PANQUEQUES (dulce de leche crêpes, crème fraîche, charred orange) - dulce de leche on anything is a win."}
{"text":"The jamon croquettes are a must try: cheese+jamon+fried=goodness. The sea bream tartare just explodes with flavours. The dish as a whole has amazing texture; the little cigarette potatoes complete it perfectly. It might be considered a bit too spicy for some, but had just the right amount of kick for me."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and inattentive service.
Literally waited 1 HOUR (or perhaps more) for the main dish to arrive. The waiter said the kitchen was \"backed up\" but all the rest of the tables around us who came later had their meals served right away...

We came in with my bulky coat and We saw a coat rack on the side but server never asked. So I asked if it was self serve or something and she then offered....

The table was extremely small (the basement) and I order tea and it was not hot. As we waited for a whopping 1 hour, she never, not even once came to ask for more hot water or another cup of coffee or no updates with the food whatsoever.

So finally my friend went over to the bar and told the staff that we have been at that point waiting for Over an hour and she obviously looked surprised and few minutes later manager arrived with the food.
Our waiter finally \"appeared\" towards the end (she was clearly avoiding our table). 

Food (winterlicious) was mediocre. was expecting something with more of a latin flare. 

And of course we didn't have to pay for the meal. Will never come and back. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"Sampled a bunch of the menu and it was all excellent. The empanadas, jamon, and rabbit were our favorites. The endive and blood orange salad and soup were very good too. Service was also great. Very unique and tasty, little expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for my Winterlicious dinner experience here a few weeks ago. What I liked - the beautiful space and friendly service (even though they initially brought me the wrong appetizer). I was less overwhelmed by the food though. Maybe my expectations were too high, but nothing really stood out. I enjoyed the flavors in the cured sardine toast, but found the albacore tuna a little dry on the outside and quite forgettable overall. For dessert, I got the quince tart with sour cream ice cream. The ice cream was definitely the highlight for me. 

It wasn't a bad meal but I definitely wasn't blown away. I didn't think my experience justified the high price and while I left feeling decently full, one of my friends was still hungry so we stopped at a fried chicken joint down the street afterwards lol. I'd be open to trying Leña again, but I certainly won't be rushing back anytime soon. My wallet still hurts!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: 
This would be my 2nd time visit to Lena! I decided to go during Winterlicious for dinner where the price was set at $48 for a 3-course meal. I came back because I really liked the ambiance and decor of the restaurant, it's small but intimate. However, I will not be visiting anytime soon. For their price range, I know of many other places that are at least 10 times better. I also had terrible service. The server was not welcoming at all, when he came around to do his quality check on our entree, my friend mentioned that she was not happy with her meal and that it was too salty. His only response was \"okay\" and did not proceed to ask if there was anything else he could do for her. He did manage to recover at the end when we were paying our bill by taking her entree off the bill but her and I were still completely thrown off by his reaction...(or lack of).

MY MEAL:
App: Vitel Toné - Charred veal carpaccio, preserved tuna mayonnaise, jardinière pickles (Winterlicious 2017)
Review: My first dish and meal for Winterlicious 2017 and it was well, mediocre. I love carpaccio and I'm a sucker for pickled veggies. I thought this dish was light but a little too acidic. I didn't mind it myself because I love pickles and pickled veggies but I thought the dish could've been better balanced out in terms of flavour.

Entrée: Chitarra À La Amatriciana Classico - Egg noodles, guanciale, chili tomato sauce, reggianito (Winterlicious 2017)
Review: My main for my first Winterlicious for 2017...and I was disappointed. The dish was way too salty and just tasted like spaghetti. I guess I was expecting more than that, especially for a higher priced pre fixe menu  

Dessert: Candied Orange & Almond Cake - Marmalade Syrup and Sour Cream Ice Cream (Winterlicious 2017)
Review: The dessert and it was also underwhelming. It was very dense and sweet and must not have been the right dessert for me because I don't have a huge sweet tooth. I thought I would like it more but I only ate the ice cream and picked off the almonds. Left the cake basically untouched."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere are plush. Loved the half-moon romantic banquette for two. We shared 3 apps and enjoyed the unusual cocktails. Tasty. Would like to return for main courses and dessert."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening on Friday night. The atmosphere is really unique and seems good for groups! The bar is in the centre when you walk in and there's multiple floors. We only had dessert! It was okay, my friends and I came here for the churros and just dessert after a meal elsewhere. 

The presentation of the desserts were a bit sloppy and careless, my friends didn't enjoy that. The flavours were unique but nothing special. For the same price tag I could have eaten a dessert from a 5 star restaurant with better quality and taste - for the same price. I might come back to try their dinner and see how it compares. My friends mentioned they wouldn't return and it wasn't worth it. The atmosphere is really pretty and nice for drinks!"}
{"text":"After a long morning of ploughing through some work with my fave colleagues, it was time to get our lunch on. 

We live for lunch. 

We wanted to check out somewhere none of us had ever been. We decided on lovely Lena. 

Well shit, it's Summerlicious. This is not my favourite. A lot of really full restaurants being stretched thin with their prix fixe hustle, but Lena handled it really well. They had walk in room in their upstairs area, and let us order from either the Summerlicious menu or their standard lunch menu. 

I had the tuna salad, orecchiette and grilled pineapple. I liked it all and I highly recommend Lena for your next bidness lunch."}
{"text":"Went to Lena for brunch on Sunday with my boyfriend. I had made reservations ahead of time as I was afraid it would be busy (knowing that it is right by Eaton's Centre). The interior is beautiful and very picture worthy (would have loved to sit on the main level, but got seated downstairs). The restaurant and the customers that eat at this place give off a very upscale and trendy vibe (understandable since it is right next to Saks Fifth Ave).

For brunch we both ordered the breakfast empanadas. The dish consisted of 2 empanadas, poached eggs, chimichurri, and sauteed spinach. The dish itself was very good in terms of flavours, but would have been enhanced if a bit of heat (spiciness) was added to it. Moreover, the portions were okay but both of us still felt hungry afterwards. We then ordered the churros. The soma mayan chocolate dipping sauce it came with was heavenly and delicious. Would come back for more churros. 

Overall, an ok experience. Felt like if I wanted to be fuller I would have needed to order more food. Price wise, it is a bit more expensive."}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday for winterliciou lunch. Very uniquely decorated place. Appetizers came pretty quick, entrée and dessert too a bit, but everything tastes great, the appetizer with veal was memorable. This place was packed, some people were there for regular brunch."}
