{"text":"Our go to spot for Breakfast!  Love, love, love the raisin toast.  Fast friendly service, great food.  Can get busy on weekends, but they open quite early.  Have had lunch there a few times also, always good.  The prices are very reasonable.  Try a cinnamon roll, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday morning for breakfast.  I ordered the Morning Mix-up, which really hit the spot.  Just enough food to fill you up without overeating.  The wait staff was very attentive and we got plenty of refills on our iced tea. The décor was nothing special, just some hometown Michigan university and Big Ten in general pennants and license plates.  We will definitely go back here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Not a dinner place.  Chicken fried steak not edible.  Gravy tasted like spackle.  Depressing atmosphere.  Friendly server."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Red Mountain Cafe today and we must say that we were very satisfied. From the warm welcoming greeting at the door, the awesome service we received from the kind and humbled waitress, to the delicious omelette and breakfast burrito we've purchased. All around amazing place. We didn't know of it's existence until today when someone recommended it to us. It's small and cozy which made the visit that much more pleasant. We will be returning with our dear family and friends."}
{"text":"Every week I go here for fried cod with fries and a salad. It's the best fish that I found around, it's always fresh and it's all you can eat.   These people will treat you right and if you had any problems will happily fix it. I intend to keep my fish ritual here.   I'm local and ate there all summer and I have to say it's even better then."}
{"text":"Red Mountain Cafe makes me sad. I wanted to like this place and love supporting local restaurants - but my entire experience was so disappointing.  It took about 30 minutes for a waitress to take our order. She was very friendly, which I must say was the only plus. I ordered a corned beef sandwich and my friend ordered the cheese quasedilla. My sandwich was about an inch tall top to bottom, with soggy bread and some weird congealed mystery meat patty, which I'm guessing was from a can. It had a greyish color to it and was cold. Also there was NOTHING on the sandwich except for the bread and the canned meat. Not even mustard like the menu said. My friends quasedilla was so greasy he said he could \"oil a car for months\" with the grease.   It stinks because the staff is so very friendly. But a LOT of work in needed on the management side of things - especially with the cooks. :( Will not be back."}
{"text":"There should be a minus rating.. We just walked out after being there for over an hour and never got our food. All the tables that came in after us (6 of them) ordered after us an were already done eating and paying their checks!  Never again.."}
{"text":"Really happy I found this place. We were driving by and yelp recommended it with 4 stars and I have to say they were spot on. We came in they had maybe 2 waitresses for the entire place but we're greeted promptly and had our drink ord r s taken within 5 minutes. Our server Constance was excellent she was attentive and always keeping us filled with drinks and got our orders perfect. I was in shock at the prices $6 for a chicken fried steak meal 20th eggs and potatoes sign me up. My wife ordered the mix up which was scrambled eggs with ham and peppers and onions over hash browns topped with cheese. I ordered the above mentioned chicken fried steak and eggs as did my Mom. The food took some time but it was worth the wait my food was perfect, eggs were over easy steak was nicely seasoned and cooked. My Mom said the gravy had a little.too much pepper for her taste but I out cholula  all over mine and it was perfect. Mom Got Home Fries Which Were Awesome And I Had The hashbrowns  Which Are Very good. My wife's was not to my taste as the vegetables were not cooked to my liking but she ate it all up. I had a scratch biscuit on the side that was excellent and made me want ro try the biscuits and gravy when I go back because I will be back. If you are in the area I think it is higher quality and better food than crackers and Co down the street ( just the location on greenfield the other crackers is a favorite of mine)"}
{"text":"Delicious! The staff is super friendly, the food is great, and they are quick! Their cinnamon roll is amazing, but does have small pieces of cooked cinnamon apples. Lunch was decent, but we mostly just go there for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a really laid back place, like to come here for breakfast, or Lunch, after church on Sunday,  or Saturday,  Biscuits and gravy is really good, along with Eggs and  Bacon or Ham, The waitresses are all very friendly and attentative to your needs,  And The prices are extremely reasonable,  I will definitely go back, again and again..."}
{"text":"Would give this place no stars if possible. Went on a Friday night for all- you-can-eat fish fry. Put in my name for 15 minute wait for a table. After half an Hr wait my husband went to check on our table only to find that they had scratched our names and given our table to someone else. After another wait we were finally seated. Took another half Hr to get our food...the special for heaven's sake. Fish was dry as shoe leather. Inedible for sure. Only thing edible was the baked potato. Guess they started the food when we signed in for the table & just kept it warm until we were allowed to eat it over an hour after entering their establishment. We were charged full price, no offer of free dessert for our inconvenience, no apology, just business as usual for them I guess. We were also told that they made true yooper pasties. Other than no rutabaggies, they were great, you just have to order ahead. No problem, except they stop making them in March so when I called ahead last week, I was told they aren't making them anymore. News flash...all eating Arizonans don't flock north for the summer. Some of us ex yoopers are here year round & support local restaurants all year! Poor customer service, poor food quality,  this place has been one disappointment after another. It's definitely a pass for us, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is THE BEST breakfast in Mesa, and I would put it up against anything in Phoenix as well.  All the reviews I read were accurate,  service is fantastic and food is amazing.  I had the country fried steak and the gravy they make is one the best I've had in awhile.  The pancakes were amazing as well,  nice and fluffy, not too thin.  After a long search of finding a breakfast spot I finally found my breakfast diner near my house."}
{"text":"Cute store front restaurant located in a strip mall.  Quaint atmosphere.  Went for the all you can eat fish.  We were given the option of baked cod, fired cod or 50/50.  We opted for the fried cod.   The meal came with soup or salad.  We both chose salad.  The salad was ok.  Iceberg lettuce, some cabbage and diced tomato.  The rest of the diner was great.  French fries were fresh and tasty.  The fish portions were huge.  Three large filets. The fish appeared to be  breaded with a Panko mix.  It was perfectly cooked.  The next time we go I am going to try the baked fish.  We were unable to eat everything we were served.  Unlike some all you can eat places we were given boxes to take our leftovers home.  There was enough left for another meal for each of us.  There are three reasons to eat here.  1. Great food.  2. Great service. Great prices.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"What there with friends this morning and breakfast was very good. The servers were very friendly and fulfilled all of your needs. The prices are excellent and the establishment is very clean. Good place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner! Very tasty food, with a classic homestyle taste. Decor is ok, especially if you're from Michigan.  A little dark on one side of the restaurant for my taste, but comfortable. Servers are a hit or miss, but their Friday fish fry is to die for!"}
{"text":"I do not know how this place has any bad reviews, yes they are typically busy but it's worth it. Everyone who works here is warm and welcoming let alone the food is amazing. Just like your mom would make. It's well worth the wait; we come at least once a week and it's consistently great."}
{"text":"My go to diner in Mesa. And surrounding areas ( haven't lived here long, so I haven't been able to try a lot of places surrounding ). Prices are more then reasonable for the quality of food and service you receive. Staff is very friendly and attentive. If your looking for the small town diner feel. I definitely recommend this place for you"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. At times the place is over run with people because of the good food and fair prices. Definitely worth the stop if you can get in the door. Local hometown feel."}
{"text":"This breaks my heart but after our experience tonight we will never be back to the Red Mountain Café. First let me say until the last three months my fiance' and I were frequent diners here (6 or more times for lunch a month and dinner 2-3 times a month) we liked the food and great prices. It was a favorite lunch spot for us and we overlooked the dated interior and less than stellar cleanliness in the front end of the restaurant. The awesome ladies who served us knew us by our first names and even our \"regular\" orders when we came. They made up for any negatives. In the last few months however everything has changed here. Service and food quality have gone completely downhill. When the \"Help Wanted\" notice for line cooks, dishwashers and other employee's was plastered in the middle of the entrance door when we arrived at about 6:00pm tonight we almost left and should have.  Tonight was the final disappointment.   I'll keep this short...I tried something new and relied upon the menu that described the dish. My \"Pork Tenders\" dinner came out as an overcooked chewy frozen preformed pork patty. It was not an actual \"pork steak\" as described in the menu that was hand breaded and fried. The Mexican Corn side dish that came out with it was cold, the canned brown gravy was barely warm and almost congealed. The only edible thing on my plate ended up being my baked potato and although it was small I made that my entire meal.  My fiancé's Ground Sirloin Dinner was a bigger disappointment if that is even possible. He ordered the meat cooked Medium Well to Well. When it arrived it appeared alright on the outside however upon cutting into the serving the outer edges were medium and the center rare. Again our server never came back and finally since we were in the front of the restaurant I called the cashier\hostess over 20 minutes later because I could finally get her attention and complained heartily sending the remainder of both meals back.  The cost of my meal was removed from our bill by the owner as it should have been. When the owner INSPECTED my fiance's half eaten meal he had the server come and tell us since he had eaten the outer somewhat cooked edge of the meat (out of hunger) that meal was \"half eaten\" and we would receive no compensation. No offer of a dessert on the house, or for something else to be prepared. We paid the remaining bill and we both left the restaurant hungry and stopped and got a sandwich on the way home. After previously finding hair in the salad served to us three months ago and other issues we will not return here again.  We found out our server was actually a line cook that had worked at the café for three years and he was in the dining room working as a server. God knows who knows who was actually cooking!  Since he never came back after he finally delivered our food we could not lodge a complaint early on or get drink refills but it would not have mattered. The owner obviously has lost control of his kitchen and food quality standards. The restaurant will go on serving mediocre food at best and will stay busy due to the \"Winter Visitor\Senior\" regulars that come in during the winter months but after Easter when times get lean at this small café they will have to do with two less year round regulars who help carry them through the summer months. I am sad and angry all at the same time over our treatment this evening."}
{"text":"Thirty-two years ago I met my husband in a restaurant; he was a cook, and I a server.  We both worked in the hospitality industry for about 15 years before changing careers, so we understand what makes a restaurant stand out above others.  In addition, we dine out more than the average person.  We mainly enjoy a restaurant with a home-town feel, consistently good food and service, and reasonable prices.  Since we discovered the Red Mountain Cafe two months ago, we have been dining there an average of three times a week.  I love the mini-breakfast which is only $3.99, served with one egg, one meat, one slice bread and sliced potatoes.  We LOVE their coffee which is the most important component of a great breakfast. Thanks, Red Mountain Cafe.  Your great staff and food have easily earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while but I have been exploring what Mesa has to offer, and it is pretty much similar stuff. First most of these places are very basic meals, old fashion breakfast because most of their customers are elderly. They have good value, because the food is half decent but nothing spectacular. I have tried several items from their menus such as : chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy, waffle, and eggs dishes. I think the best thing actually is their cinnamon roll. It is ginormous but it is pretty moist for such a huge thing, and the frosting is not bad. It is priced wrong by the way on their web site just so you won't be surprise. All in all, I liked their food, but nothing to go out of your way for but a good value plus these guys open at 5:00 AM which is really different for Arizona. These people are midwest people so they are use to it, because I am also an illini, so I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Gosh love their coffee always fresh. Really cheap price and foods are just as good as other fancy overpriced  breakfast place. Nice servers. Maybe because majority customers are old people or family who doesn't write reviews here the rating is not so good. The only down side is I hope to have outdoor seating when the weather is nice. But again can't beat this place for foods, price, service."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Waitresses who don't want to be there and run of the mill shamrock pee made food."}
{"text":"Show up on Monday to place your order or Pasty's - pick up Tuesday. Very good and love the brown gravy that goes with it! Nice friendly people running this very busy establishment. We're going to try breakfast there soon."}
{"text":"Great homemade meals. Menu items are very affordable. My husband and I are frequent visitors, I think everytime we're the only ones under 50."}
{"text":"The first time I came here the service was amazing and the food was too.  Just left and I am so upset.  The waitress was extremely slow (as in she should find something else to do).  I kept having to ask another waitress for things because ours would disappear.  Then my food came out less than luke warm.  By time our \"waitress\" got back to us it was cold.   They took it in the back and nuked it.  Management did nothing to resolve.  I am so very disappointed!! The 3 stars is for the food and my first time here otherwise a one star would have been given."}
{"text":"Food was good-chicken fried steak and eggs hit the spot. Though, I felt extremely young being there."}
{"text":"Great small family type diner, not fancy but has great breakfasts at a good price.  Friendly, speedy service and you never run out of coffee in your cup.  This is our go to for breakfast on the weekends.  Have eaten lunch and dinner here, again nothing fancy but good food at a good price.  Hubby is in love with the 1/2 pound burger.... Service is always excellent.  Just be aware that during the winters, this place is quite crowded on Sundays... try to arrive early..."}
{"text":"Let's see... Mom and I out for the day... decide to have dinner on the way home. We agreed to support a local café/rest. vs a franchise, so we actually turned around to go to a cafe where in the past has, she has had a great home made cinnamon roll... so my Mom is 82... we turn around.  Get to the café:  Special Today: Prime Rib 16.99... My mother loves prime rib.  So we ordered it. Salad out of a sack...The dressing is good... and  I'm ok with that... it's a kind of hole in the wall café... I get the vibe.  String beans...tiny serving...I'm ok with that... but out of a can?  Ok... still no complaining.  But when I see my mother cutting (or shall I say attempting to \"saw thought the meat\" I mention that it looks tough and offer some of my dinner.  She accepts and as a loving mother would do, she puts a piece of the meat on a platter for me... Sweet.  So, before I say any more, I try to stick my fork it in... Not happening.  The majority of her meat is TOUGH AS LEATHER.   When a waitress did come by, I mentioned that, \"We were not looking for anything\", but wanted to let her know the meat is really tough.  When she returns, she said something to the effect, \"I don't know what to do, but the owner isn't going to do anything about it, she says if you want to have it cooked more we can do that\"... My answer.... As I took  a STAB at a piece and asked her to send it back to the owner, was, \"It isn't how the meat is cooked,,, It's simply a bad/tough piece of meat\".. just thought someone would want to know.... Well.. fast forward... All we were trying to do was to let the cook/owner/staff... anyone that might be interested... that the meat was tough.  Take it off the menu... talk to your vendor... a tough meat does not get more tender if you toss it back on the Barbie.   Bad review?  You bet.  My first bad review.  Yes. and I hope to never have another... We are ranchers... not beggers... all anyone had to say was... \"Thank you for bringing it to our attention.... we'll take it into consideration.... something... not...\"There is nothing wrong with the meat... let's try cooking it again.\"  The owner refused to come out to speak with us... Bad idea.  Franchise or local... you still need to care about your customers... I felt bad for the servers.  Seems it was an awkward position for them... and I don't think it was the first time.  Good thing is:  We left a nice JUICY tip... the only thing juicy regarding that dinner.  The end."}
{"text":"For the past 22 yea we have came here for breakfast when visiting Mesa.  The food is always amazngand large portions.  Crunchy French toast is out of this world.   Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday- late morning, so it was prime time. Was able to get a table right away which was wonderful because they had most of the table full. I ordered the Chicken Slouvaki sandwich with fries. Hot and fresh food with a soft pita.  The Diet Coke was good and I didn't need to request refills- our server was on it! The BF got a BLT on sourdough- the bacon was thick, with the right amount of crispiness and smokey flavor was on point! Best BLT either of us has tasted in a while.  I also got a side of ranch for my fries and it was also tasty. Friendly and fast service. Will come again! Thank You!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place!! One of our new favorites! Service is outstanding and the food taste like down home country goodness."}
{"text":"This is a true midwest cafe in Mesa!  The food comes out quick, its hot and it taste good.  The prices are also great compared to some of the other places in town that want to charge you fortune for something simple like a salad or a couple eggs.  I love going here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  There is a period during the year that they offer pasty's which are a really great old style meal that miners used to take into the mines.  My mom back in Michigan used to make them and I missed them until I found this place. YUM"}
{"text":"I really don't understand all of the 5 star reviews - I suppose much of the clientele that frequent this place are elderly and probably would also leave raving reviews about their local Denny's. Which is basically what this place tastes like...   I couldn't finish my skillet because it just tasted so canned - as if the gravy came out of a packet. The toast I got came buttered but it was just oil they brushed on making the bread soggy. I actually ended up with a terrible stomach ache from all the grease.   Maybe I just prefer places that source food locally and actually cook their items from scratch, but my grandpa seems to love this place. Who knows, maybe you will too."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and never took the time to tell them how great they are, so today's the day. Food is amazing. You can tell when George is cooking, which is almost always. His food just tastes the best. You can tell when he's on vacation. He's also friendly- he waves and says hi from the kitchen- he doesn't have to do that. You can tell he's proud of his work, as he should be. He even sometimes walks around and says hi to customers and makes sure they like their food. Such a nice guy. The waitresses are great. Brenda is our favorite,  but they're all great. We love Felicia and Holly too. Service is always fast, coffee never empty. The waitresses know our order and always get it in fast. We always order the same thing, and if George sees us come in, he starts our food, which we appreciate very much."}
{"text":"Very. Good fish sandwich and rhubarb pie. 3. 2. 2012"}
{"text":"Local spot, great staff, fast great food. Visiting from California for Spring Training. Be prepared to wait a little time for Sat/Sun brunch."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to swing on in and try this place out on a whim.  You wouldn't expect to find this lonely eatery among the few remaining establishments scattered along a long-vacated row of storefronts it shares in this once-thriving strip mall, but there it is!   And thank the heavens that this little gem has managed to ride out the last few years' financial turmoil and still be there to deliver good food at good prices to good people. Maybe that's the real reason they're still around!  Inside, you are welcomed by a split dining room that is sparsely adorned and clearly outdated with a spattering of \"Yooper\"/upper-Michigan paraphenalia hung about, but that helps to reinforce the relaxed and comfortable attitude both the staff and menu display.   It's obvious that this establishment thrives on the elderly-oriented business from the various mobile home parks, assisted-living homes and retirement communities surrounding it. Winter packs this place tight with \"Snow Birds\" at meal times, however, Red Mountain Cafe has something for everyone and the wait is never unreasonable.  My girlfriend and I are spirited young adults and even we found it to be a place we can relate to.  The menu is classic American comfort food all the way. Totally an Eggs n' Bacon for breakfast, Sandwiches and Burgers for lunch type of affair with a few Americanized Mexican efforts tossed in (but not recommended). This is where post-game golfers go to lounge with a refreshing coke in hand and debate whether Coleslaw is more American than Potato Salad while they both share a basket of Sweet Potato Fries!   All the food we have tried, aside from the Chimichanga, has been decent. The Philly Cheesesteak, one of my favorite items on the menu, isn't what I'd call entirely \"authentic\", but it's a darn tasty interpretation using thick cuts of fresh Roast Beef and a buttered, toasted hoagie bun!  Prices are very reasonable. Both Third-Pound and Half-Pound Burgers are available for the hungry and the hungrier. Both the burgers and the decently-sized Sandwiches (not huge, but filling and tasty) range from $4-$7. Most menu items outside of breakfast come with at least one generous side, with primary choices being Coleslaw, Potato Salad, French Fries or a Side Salad. Various specials are posted on a board as you walk in and there is a Soup-of-the-Day available as well.  The quality of the ingredients is excellent and the taste of all items we have tried has been very good. This isn't world-class dining by a long stretch, but better than the Denny's alternative! Service is what you'd expect from a place where regulars are referred to by name and the overall value for your money (and time) is high!  If you can take a few minutes out of your day to enjoy this easy-going diner with horrible decor, I know you'll just love it!"}
{"text":"I really have no clue why this place has a four star Yelp rating. Typically the choices I make based on reviews are pretty spot on.   First time/last time visit Saturday morning for brunch. When our party arrived we waited roughly ten minutes not too bad and the place seemed rather full. Decor is extremely outdated and the restaurant is very dirty.   After we were seated we quickly realized that the reason the place was packed is because the service is terribly slow. Took 10 minutes to get our initial drinks. At that time we placed our orders. 45 minutes later we received our food. Everyone in the party except for myself ordered breakfast. I was told only the gravy was good everything else was bland. I ordered the Reuben sandwich which was greasy, bland, and featured obviously canned sauerkraut. The French fries were not seasoned what so ever.  I forgot to mention that my five year old sons food did not arrive with everyone elses. We assumed they would be right back with it. Ten minutes later when our waitress walked by I mentioned it and she did apologize but come on!!  Highly recommend going to another establishment. I will never return."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a handful of times over the past 5 or 6 years.  I usually get their chicken schwarma, and I enjoy it.  I've never been for breakfast, although I went for dinner for the first time yesterday evening.  The thing about this place is that it's exactly what you should expect - homestyle food.  Mom and pop place frequented by a lot of locals/regulars.  Waitstaff has always been friendly.  The food is neither fancy nor gourmet.  Side salads consist of iceburg lettuce with some chopped tomatoes on top.  For dinner I got the Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken was nice and crispy, although the flavor of the tomato sauce was nothing to write home about, and the was only a small amount of cheese sprinkled on top.  The rest of the guests with me for dinner (from Michigan, I might add) enjoyed their meals.  And the taco salad that one of them ordered looked amazing!   I guess what I'm trying to say is that no, the food here isn't fantastic.  It's okay, and the decor and prices are appropriate for the quality of their food.  Fellow yeplers, please keep in mind, this is a small place with down-home cooking, and a basic menu and flavors.  When you see 3 or 4 stars, it's 3 or 4 stars for the type of restaurant that this is.  You can't compare it to 3 or 4 stars at some fancy, high-priced eatery."}
{"text":"Meh. If you're super old and your taste buds are failing you'll probably enjoy this place. Cheap prices but tiny portions. Like super tiny. Had a microscopic ham steak with veggies. Think school cafeteria corn carrots and green beans. So yucky. Ham was tasty though I was done in five bites. The kid chicken fingers were actually pretty decent. Hamburger for her was OK. Didn't try the desserts. Won't be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places when we want a good, no frills, casual, come as you are atmosphere with friendly faces and service that is outstanding!!!!!  Food is good too and I've yet to have one of their cinnamon rolls. They look so amazing I'm afraid if I had one, I'd immediately go into a coma!!!!  This is really a CUTE little place!!"}
{"text":"Super good and cute little cafe. Ordered the chorizo omelette and it was amazing! The waitresses were very kind and I always had water and coffee. I would go back here again."}

{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak and it was awesome. I am VERY picky when it comes to chicken fried steak and this was 5 star.  My friend had steak and eggs, and it was done perfect. I have not tried dinner or lunch but the breakfast is amazing. Everything is made from scratch. The service is 5 star. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible and I have never thrown up after eating breakfast. But yes as soon as we left, they got there breakfast back. Negative 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for a great, reasonably priced breakfast. The only down side, which is really an upside for them, is waiting for a table. They are always PACKED! It's truly worth the wait though. This isn't just general diner/cafe food, they step up the breakfast regime for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  I had the gyro and eggs.  My boyfriend had country fried steak and eggs.  All Very flavorful, not overly greasy.  Ice tea was good (something I always look for).  Cinnamon roll to share was 2.75 HUGE.  For that price you might as well give it a try.  It was pretty tasty!  Busy place yet service was still good.   If they let a little sunlight in the place it would improve the atmosphere a lot."}
{"text":"This was very good. Delicious biscuits and gravy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Very friendly and attentive staff and the prices are very reasonable. Oh and I didn't get a picture but they have giant cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because of the four-star rating. The first thing that I noticed when we walked in was a huge stain on the hostesses shirt. The restaurant is split into two sides.    Both sides have very old outdated booths and freestanding tables. The hostess wanted to seat us next to the door when you first walk in, bad choice !!!!! First of all this is Mesa Arizona, every time that door opened 110 degrees of heat comes in. Not a good way to keep customers happy. We move to a booth where when I sat down there was basically no cushion. My bottom hits the hard flat surface that the cushion was supposed to protect you from. Our waitress was nice served us our coffee very fast but then decide to scream across the restaurant to tell a customer she had in the past about her masters degree she's getting over the Internet. The food was average, I really liked my coffee and my toast. My omelet was semi-warm.  my husband liked his breakfast, but he is a goat and will eat anything. I don't think we will be going back."}

{"text":"I got the philly steak and it was great! They put a lot of cheese on it. Lots of places go cheap on the cheese."}

{"text":"Delicious breakfast! Homemade food is the best! We had omelets, pancakes, and French toast with all the sides (sausage, bacon, and hash browns). Everyone left full and happy."}
{"text":"Wow ... this place DEFINITELY is racist when it pertains to how they serve.  I'm not originally from the Midwest, I'm originally from NYC.  I'm NOT Caucasian (I'm Asian and proud of it) and I try to support small business.  We (husband and I) have been here about 5 times.  I have noticed that EVERY time we are here every table is automatically served with ice water.  Yet when we go there we do not get served water ever.  Also I noticed that every table (besides ours) gets a breakfast and lunch menu.  But of course we do not.  I'm not the type to yell \"racism\" so quick but after 5 different visits and noticing the same thing... I do believe its racial tendency.  Automatically receiving the water and getting both lunch and breakfast menus when seated may seem like a small thing but it's the principle.  I always try to support small business but I will not support small businesses with racial tendencies!  I will go to McDonalds before I ever give this place anymore business.  What a shame that this behavior still exists in 2016... smh"}

{"text":"This is your average, small town atmosphere kind of cafe. They have them all over the south. Being from the south, it's my kind of place. The blueberry pancakes were very good and real blueberries inside. Coffee is good. There are some rough around the edges wait staff, but that's what is to be expected in this type of establishment. Get over yourself if you're too sensitive. I've read the other reviews and basically it's just perception. If this is your kind of place, you'll like it."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. A little cafe in a strip mall. The food is American home style cooking at is absolute best. Get there early on Friday for fish. They're very efficient never more than 15 min wait. The service is wonderful. Wait staff is in constant motion. Love Red Mountain. Something a little different for all you can eat cod. You can have fried or baked or both. Real mashed potatoes. The food is great. The people are friendly. I highly recommend Red Mountain. Oh! How could I forget. They have a cinnamon roll that is huge! It makes Cinnabon look like mini bons."}
{"text":"We were there for breakfast and found the food good. Normal breakfast fare. Service was awesome. Food ok. Not gonna write home about it and it's not good enough to make you want to slap your mama."}
{"text":"I have been searching for fish fry and this is it!!!! We moved in the area 6 weeks ago and have had fish fry at least 4 times!!! All u can eat cod...fried/ baked / both!! Choice of soup (NE clam chowder fridays), salad, coleslaw all very good...fish with choice of fries, baked potato(recommend), or fruit...service is verrrrrry friendly...oh...fish fry is on Wednesdays and fridays!!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Come by every time we are in town.  Great service, people and food day or night."}
{"text":"This is a great diner- the breakfasts are so great! Love the breakfast burrito- so big though you can share it!  Prices are great too- several weekly specials, and they are very family/customer service driven"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was hot and came out to us fast especially bring as busy as they were. Great little place for breakfast."}
{"text":"The absolute best café in the valley!  Great quality food , great service and reasonable prices.  I like that they are pro-gun and pro America!  The people that work there are absolutely fantastic and always greeted with a smile.  #ProudAmerican"}
{"text":"My coworker and I come here enough I think by now to type up a solid review. We normally order take out during breakfast hours to eat at work when we are starving and loving everything from this establishment. The prices are crazy reasonable and will come back because of the fact.  It is worth every penny and it's nothing to say wow their food is amazing, but for the price I will come back time and time again.  My coworker and I get the same thing every time. Steak and eggs with has browns for me potatoes for her and I always get the raisin bread and she gets the pancakes. The pancakes are pretty good even if they are cold and have been sitting for a bit. I know that sounds a bit gross but when you work in a high volume place with no breaks except a 30 minute lunch in between it's nice to have little bites every once in awhile as a snack.  Before going to work today we decided to stop and eat there for once since we had a little bit of time.  Everything went fine, fast and smooth and no complaints what so ever.  The staff was beyond pleasant and that's always nice to have eating out."}
{"text":"Horrible! Should have read reviews before trying. I tried to call in a to-go order and was put on hold indefinitely. I decided to leave the call connected and drive there. I walk in the place, going on 13 minutes on hold. At first, seeing they were completely packed (of only senior citizens), I thought I'd let it go since they were so busy.   When I got to the register and asked to make a  to-go order, the girl asked if I called it in. I showed her I was still on hold, and she kinda snickered saying, \"oh shoot\", and then walks off... no apology whatsoever.   Another lady took my order. I told her it's my first time there and told her about the phone call. Again no apology. Instead she says, \"ya I've called before and can't get through.\"  I ordered a Ruben sandwich and a bacon cheeseburger. I will say they were nice enough to give two free slices of pumpkin pie.  I chatted with an older gentleman while I was there and he told me about the place having issues in the past, but that it was good. My mind went to ease.   After getting home the Ruben's corned beef was nothing like corned beef and overcooked. I'd call it mystery meat. Burger was also overcooked and just whatever. The free pie awful, and tasted like pumpkin chalk.   I took the Ruben back just to ask what the heck it really is. I asked to speak to a manager, and he/she wouldn't even come out. Pretty bizarre.   Steer clear of this place!!! Read all the other reviews before trying!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. A good variety menu and low prices. But, today's  corned beef and cabbage was not their signature dish. I was disappointed. But I will return because their meat loaf and chicken fried stead are very good."}
{"text":"Was looking for a non-chain breakfast place in Mesa and picked Red Mountain Cafe based on the yelp ratings.   We were seated immediately and our waitress came over right away to take our drink order. Whenever we ran low on coffee it was refilled promptly without having to ask for refills.   I had the bacon & eggs breakfast, and hubby had the veggie omelet. Both were cooked perfectly and the hash browns were delicious as well. The food arrived quickly after we placed our order.   All staff was very friendly and courteous. Will definitely go back again and would recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"My husband and I just Discovered this place after many years living in the vicinity! Being born and raised in the U.P. (ie Yooper) I was delighted to find a place \"like home\". We had a great breakfast, friendly fast service at a fair price. Can't wait to try the Pasty's! And If you're a midwesterner or from Michigan you'll feel right at home. Great find and they acquired new customers!"}
{"text":"Great fish fry on Wed & Fridays. Just like the midwest! They keep providing great food time after time ... Please give them taste!"}
{"text":"Nice, little spot for breakfast. Polite waitresses, strong coffee, and realistic food portions. They open at 5AM, and it's generally SLAMMED with adorable elderly clientele. Not much to say! Just a solid little spot!"}
{"text":"Average cafe.  Small not much seating but great lemon meringue pie!"}
{"text":"Came here cus I was hungry and out and about. I ordered the BLT on sourdough with a side of potato salad. It was a regular basic BLT. The potato salad was okay, didn't taste homemade which kinda bummed me out... it was a lil watery. Probably will be my only visit."}
{"text":"Michigan anything fans, this is your breakfast place.  Really good breakfast selection, decent prices, and a very friendly staff. Im pretty sure we were the youngest people in the restaurant, but I dont care. Their food is GOOD.  My husband enjoyed a Belgiun waffle, bacon, and eggs while I had the morning mashup...i think thats what it was called. It was basically a denver omelet w/ bacon mashed together w/ hash browns. While it didnt look \"pretty\", it was delicious.  We'll definitely be visiting again when were in the east valley."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Décor is a little outdated, but for a place where mostly older people go, it isn't that bad. The food is good, the service is good. All in all a good place to get a decent meal."}
{"text":"Delicious homecooked meals with excellent service and fair price.  Awesome place for breakfast or lunch.  Clean family cafe atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here for breakfast. Kids love the biscuit and gravy as do I. Its due for a makeover though. Friendly staff and reasonable prices, good coffee too."}
{"text":"Oh yelp you steered me wrong! Before I begin it should be known that I AM a yooper from the upper peninsula in Michigan and grew up with nothing but small \"ma and pa\" diners. Stick to your rib, no frills, just good hearty food was the norm for me, so I was excited to try this place. Moreover a restaurant owned by people from my neck of the woods was so appealing to me, and being a bit homesick, I dragged my hubby there this morning. What a disappointment.   They were a little busy as to be expected on a Sunday, and we ignored the fact that a gentleman who came after us was seated first, but I think it struck a subconscious cord with us. Again, to be fair, there was a huddle of people by the register, how were they to know?  We were seated pretty quickly which was nice, but we had about four different waitresses throughout, none particularly pleasant because they were so quick and rushed. And I was disappointed that my attempt for small talk with our main waitress was rebutted. Damn, wanted to talk about Michigan but she had no clue where the owners were from (though there were \"yooper\" flags all over.  Now the food. Corned beef hash was from a can (we were warned by our waitress) and my biscuits and gravy were dry with meatless gravy. Wonderbread toast, undercooked scrambled eggs and just weak coffee just made this breakfast heartbreaking.   I really really hate to post this review. I am nowhere near a food snob or picky for that matter, but this was sad. Even the canned hash would be forgiven if there was flavor added (hell I grew up on the stuff). But we were left with upset tummies and even worse, wasted time. At least it was less that 30 bucks, but I would've paid double for a good meal and nice time."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this cafe and just now found this little gem. It's a cute little cafe with ample seating and an old time atmosphere. My gf and I arrived during prime time on a Sunday but were seated immediately with a smile. Our waitress was amazing. We couldn't drink our beverages fast enough and she catered to us quite well considering how busy it was. I ordered the BLT and the SO had the open face meatloaf sammich. The BLT was amazing. Cool crisp lettuce, ripe red tomatoes and perfectly cooked smoked bacon at just the right thickness on flawlessly toasted sourdough. The open face meatloaf tasted like my grandma cooked it! Ohhhh the memories. The French fries were also amazing; golden brown with thick clouds of tater' goodness. Oh, and the ranch is delightful. No hidden valley here!   If your in Mesa, stop by here for a quick bite. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Recently I visited very \"at home\" feeling restaurant called Red Mountain Café.  It was one of the thriving businesses in a fairly empty plaza, until recently accompanied by Goodwill. This little \"whole in the wall\" is the only one in Arizona and they want to keep it that way. Majority of customers are the elderly either for a sit down breakfast or golfers looking for an evening meal after a long day's golf.  They make their target customers very obvious considering they open up their doors at 5 a.m. I don't know any young adults or teenagers that are waking up that early. Since I'm a young adult and struggle to make it out of bed at ten o'clock in the morning, I missed breakfast. I decided I would give this place a shot on a Saturday evening with my family with me. The atmosphere was great, the servers were very nice, and after we were done ordering our food, we were stuffing our faces ten minutes later  Their menu is a classic American menu such as; BLT, baked potatoes, French fries, etc. Off this particular menu I ordered the quarter pounder mushroom and it was AMAZING! They really stuck to the specifics of my order and it's been a while since a restaurant has gotten my order right. Everything was fresh and tasted great. If your burger is dripping because of how fresh the lettuce is, the restaurant is doing something right. Out of the entire experience this best part about. The thing I didn't really like was the lack of urgency once they got busy. It seemed like there was a lot of standing around when things needed to be done.  Overall it was a great experience, especially for a not so popular classic American joint. My family and I loved it. Since our first visit we have gone back three more times. I definitely recommend this to anybody who likes a nice time and a good burger."}
{"text":"Went into this little cafe for breakfast one morning because it was close to where I was visiting in Mesa, AZ. I love getting breakfast skillets because its a little of everything. Here I got he country skillet without the gravy. It wasn't anything special. Didn't taste special or anything either.   My friend had the crunchy french toast and they looked soggy to me so I didn't try them. He also had the corned beef hash which looked pretty good.   I gave this place 3 stars because there was good service but the food wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"The people who work there are really nice but the customers are amazing-we have met some of the nicest people in this little restaurant~"}
{"text":"As for breakfast, 5 stars. Amazing, huge portions, SO cheap, great service and home-y feel to the place. As for the lunch....more like 3 stars. Portions are fine, but the options just aren't great."}
{"text":"Friday night...all you can eat Fish and Chips. I had fried. My wife had baked. We also had Clam Chowder. I'll just say everything was delicious. Fish was light and flakey. My fried version was not greasy at all. They were BUSY!! Highly recommend this establishment. Great friendly staff. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Great for Breakfast.  Haven't tried lunch yet but the service and breakfast items are always good and the service is great.  Mostly regulars in the morning.  Would recommend this place for early risers in east mesa."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this place. My husband and I had breakfast there yesterday. My husband had the Three meat omelet, I had the Spanish omelet. The eggs were like sheets of rubber and my toast was burnt. I told the waitress that I couldn't get past the burnt toast and she acted like...Oh, well... I-Hop or Denny's would have been better!"}
{"text":"So I do not usually go out to breakfast, however, this will be my spot from now on. Great food, service and he location was close to home....perfect! My country fried steak and eggs were good, a little smothered in gravy, but still good. I highly suggest this place for an as close to home taste that you can not find at the '$ilver' chains or dennys.....good stuff."}
{"text":"Not bad of a place. I orders the Philly Steak. Taste is good, fries were over cooked. Got some Mozzarella sticks too and they were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Good Breakfast.  Had Denver Omelet,  nice portion.  Son had the country skillet,  breakfast plate mixed up and covered with gravy, delicious!   Cheap meal if you get waters.   Our tab blew up another $5 with juice and coffee.   Opens at 5am, good enough to take the kids if there awake early before school.   Only drawback was the old guys with the heavy sailor talk, and the weak signal WiFi.   Good portion,  good prices."}
{"text":"We have been here several times.  Breakfast is ok but not consistent, we tried lunch once and we said never again, frozen fried chicken, over cooked vegetables and the fries- how can you mess those up? Prices are reasonable for the average food they serve.  Some of the staff are friendly, but there are some of their staff that should find a different job."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped today for a late lunch. The place was still busy, and we soon knew why. The food was brought to us piping hot, and everything tasted like it was made from scratch and was very flavorful. We'll definitely return for another meal soon!"}
{"text":"Went here with the hubby & my 2 littlest ones for a Saturday breakfast a couple of weekends ago. Saw many good posts about this joint and I wanted to check it out. Sorry I'm just posting this now!  This place did not disappoint! People were friendly and service was pretty quick. I believe that we were one of the youngest ones there (lots of seniors).  Portions were great and coffee was excellent which is something I look out for. A diner-feel place and that's a really big plus for me! We were tempted to start out with the cinnamon roll, but we saw a couple of them passing by and they were as huge as bricks! We decided to skip on that because the menu items were what we were aiming for. My hubby usually orders the chicken fried steak and fixings, but he didn't care for that this time and wanted to try something different. I on the other hand, not a \"chicken fried steak for breakfast gal,\" ordered that ha! Food came out hot, fixings were cooked nicely, condiments readily available on the table. Portion size was perfect for me and it came with a sausage gravy that was yummy! The meal comes with toast, choice of potatoes and choice of eggs. I will order this again for sure. Kids ordered the normal \"one egg, 2 bacon, and toast deal\" and also wanted to share some pancakes so we ordered a short stack (they were pretty big). Kiddos normally take half home of anything they eat, but this time they ate everything - including the short stack! That tells me not only were they extremely happy, but that the food was delicious and then they were taking bites from our plates too (they're 8 & 9)!  Great little place - very homey and I'll definitely come back for the breakfast with the fam again. I'll try to come back in to try the lunch one day as they looked intriguing to me as well! Check out my pix for the chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. This place was listed on Yelp as one of the best fish fries in Mesa. Tried it on a Friday night and it wasn't very good. Very dry fish and didn't care for the breading. Decided to try this place again a couple of times since it's close but both experiences were disappointing. Fried Chicken was cold inside and after the kind waitress returned it to be redone, it still came out cold. My husband's sandwich was put together poorly and served without mayo. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place takes you back in time. Definitely dated decor and ambiance but works for its clientele and business objectives. Was fun to be in an atmosphere where things arent hustle and bustle. Customers were reading Sunday's paper, filling out cross word puzzles, working on craft projects...  Food was good enough, as expected with the price point and home-cooking feel."}
{"text":"I came back here for a pasty on Tuesday, as Tuesday is the only day you can get one.. A pasty is a pie crust pastry filled with meat and potatoes and other vegetables. It's like a pot pie in a pastry pocket. I had these as a kid when I lived in northern Wisconsin. This was a traditional staple in the early 1900s for the miners in upper Michigan. The miners would brag about whose wife made the best pasty. I'll bet the ones from this place would have taken the prize.     As always the hostess sat us immediately and the waitress was right there to take our drink order. When I got my pasty It was hot out of the oven. When I cut it open steam rose out of it filling the air with the delicious aroma I had remembered as a kid. It was quite large, but I savored every bite (what I could eat of it)      If you go it is recommended that you call ahead or come in early because they go quickly and they only make just so many for the day. They start serving at 11:00 am until they are gone."}
{"text":"So I live in the greenfield area here in Mesa AZ, me and my boyfriend wanted to try out a new place to eat we decided to go eat at Red Mountain cafe the moment that we entered we were greeted and sat down the waitress gave us a menu and told us about the special she was really nice we told her it was my first time here mainly seniors come to this place I mean anything on greenfield or pass Greenfield to power or even in Apache Junction we all know the snowbirds area lol  food was good if I was a 80 year old woman and had no taste I mean if I was hungry I would eat here again so I like to support independent businesses I would just try to order something else later on that month I seen on the news that there were many violations and they failed their inspections need on the floor no washing their hands and this just made me think about my food how was made so I don't think I would ever be going back customer service was great though"}
{"text":"Red Mountain Cafe is one of scant few restaurants open at 5:00 AM in Mesa. The breakfasts are exceptional and reasonably priced.  Staff is friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  Not sure why I had my sites set so low, but it didn't disappoint.  Two eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast for under $8.  Good deal.  In all likelihood I'll be back"}
{"text":"This cafe serves the best pasty (pass-tea, not paste-t) outside Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  Tuesday is pasty day, and you can reserve pasties in advance.    If you come for breakfast, you can have a cinnamon roll that's fresh, HUGE, and worth every calorie.  It might not be the fanciest restaurant in Arizona, but for the quality and the price, it is Arizona's best VALUE!!!!"}
