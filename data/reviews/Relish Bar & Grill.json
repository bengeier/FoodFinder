{"text":"Brunch review  We went today for brunch with my friends and their kids.   The bunch wasn't that exciting which is too bad, there aren't many nice spots in that area to pick from.   The menu was predominantly lunch items. We ordered the Eggs Benedict (muffin not toasted) which came with a large boring salad. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito and said it was bland. The side of roasted potatoes saved the day!   The server was a very nice and they were very attentive. They didn't seem to mind when the girls kept dropping their forks.   Maybe the dinner is better....?"}
{"text":"What a lovely lunch! I've always enjoyed their food but hadn't brought the 1 1/2 year old kiddo there before, and I think our particular mother-toddler daytime lunch date experience warrants sharing, for the parents among us.   The folks at Relish were awesome in several ways:  1. When we came in, they asked if we'd like a table \"for the two of you.\"(So many restaurants offer me a table for one and I know they don't mean anything by it, but I really appreciate when someone acknowledges our kid.) 2. The high chair was quite clean! 3. They happily made a grilled cheese for my daughter. 4. Without asking, they let the grilled cheese cool to kiddo-friendly temperature before bringing it to the table! 5. They served her meal a little before mine, without my asking (or even thinking to ask for it) so I could get her content and would have a little more breathing room to enjoy my own lunch. Super, super thoughtful! 6. Both of our lunches were DELICIOUS. 7. The chefs smiled at Eleanor from behind the line. Our server was that perfect kind of friendly that's warm but still genuine. 8. The music playing in the background included old Weezer, Okkervil River, The Beatles, Paul Simon, and The Shins.  Thanks, Relish. I wish you lots of success and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a nice tapas place at a really reasonable price point. I usually order about 5 dishes to share. I have been here many times and always enjoy eating here. The staff are really competent and friendly, service is fast.  My only complaint would be that the menu should change more frequently - if it did, I would return more often. There are always a few daily specials but when you are ordering so many dishes, it is nice to have more churn on the menu.  They usually play pretty funky music, and there is a nice buzz to the place on the weekend."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure what I was expecting when I went into Relish. I have passed it many times and disregarded it as another dive along that strip just east of Woodbine/Danforth.  The decor is something to be desired with tables and chairs you'd be pressed to find in a diner that serves both Canadian and Chinese food. In the far back of this narrow space was a cute little lounging area I didn't venture. Perhaps I claim that spot in my next visit (yes, the four stars and its close proximity to my home warrants its anther visit... and I haven't even gotten to the food yet!)  The tapas they served are just fantastic! A couple of those and I'm a satisfied-no-longer-hungry little person. It was very hard to decide which dishes to try especially when I limited myself to two.... I ordered three (tee-hee). And the staff was super friendly - the type you wish every establishment in your neighbourhood would have.   I shall return to conquer the rest of the menu... possibly on Open Mic Night, you don't know..."}
{"text":"First time here found it online because of the Gluten free menu; reserved for 6 of us for a  dinner birthday gathering. The birthday guy is celiac so the gluten free menu was key (& all we ordered off).  We will be back for the food, nice job!! Loved the music (iPod on shuffle, but great tunes - flaming lips - bowie- rolling stones- beck- local acts and everything in between.) The service was good, albeit a little scattered (we were served by both waiters + manager(?), guessing/hoping they pool tips), at one time they tried to bring us a drink 3 times, a bit of miscommunication.  We had about 4 rounds of tapas, including (our favs) chicken roulade, sirloin, curry shrimp, chicken tortilla shell, trio of dips, calamari.... Portions could be a tad bigger(or have a larger size for larger groups), but all told we were all satisfied and tried 10 different ones, (a couple twice).  Beer selection was awesome and they have Foundery on tap (fantastic cider). Even 2 gf beers... Next time we will start with the chicken tortilla shell and dips (we did have the grilled pita- yummy, but non gf, they provide gf garlic toast when ordering off the gf menu, still very nice). Price: actually decent.... worked out to about $50/ person including tip (2 drinks/ person, no dessert). And we didn't leave hungry. It was quiet when we got there at 6 on  Saturday and was full when we left. Open kitchen is nice (I work in a restaurant, always like to see how the kitchen works/looks), decor needs help, and chairs aren't good for more after 2 hours.  But we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome tapas style. We had The tortilla soup, warmed olives, roasted beet and green bean salad. A perfect tasting meal. Very nice service."}
{"text":"What a great little jewel. Small, friendly with a great atmosphere. Live music and a terrific beer and wine selection are complemented by a very good tapas menu. Hard to go wrong. Two thumbs up guys."}
{"text":"Yum. Not everything was stellar, but the sage crepe mentioned by eh B is not to be missed.  Also had a special which was a beef tenderloin my girlfriend described as a meaty dessert, it was just so delicious and was served last.  The order is which things arrived was a little random, but mostly worked.  I've been three times now, other reviews are bang on, just a rare gem of a place for this end of town.  If you live around here, you'll want to try it."}
{"text":"Love!  Amazing delivery option if want something tasteful, with quality preparation and ingredients without leaving the house.  Lots of delicious vegetarian options.... Squash crepe, eggplant fritter, pesto gnocchi, and more.... Pita w dips is a yummy starter!"}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine catering to vegetarian and non vegetarians alike. Good wine list and wide beer selection. Attentive and charming service. Great place to entertain. Live music and warm ambience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of tapas, but I can't say that these hit me in me where the tapas normally too.  I find the dishes underwhelming and mushy/greasy.   For what you get, including the atmosphere, I would say it is overpriced."}
{"text":"i've blogged on other sites to say this as a warning, check your food very carefully cus we found a long hair in our mussels after waiting a very long time for A. the service (there was hardly anyone there yet the waiter took forever to give us a simple thing as coffee cus he was busy chatting with the bartender.)  B. the food  which was overpriced and \"due to the gluten free bandwagon, charge them extra\" for a tiny tapas. C. the quality control of the kitchen, god know what else was in the food if the sun hadn't beam down so strong through the window we never would've seen the hair sticking out like a sore thumb. and to ad salt to our wound we had to pay for what we had eaten only excluding the mussels with the hair.  never will i recommend this place to anyone NEVER!!!! btw my friend also so a cockroach in the washroom when she was in there. how this place is still running is beyond me."}
{"text":"One of the best on the Danforth!  East of Pape, this is one of the best places you'll find for a great tasting meal and a good pint of beer.  The food is served tapas style and ooh so good.  I enjoyed both the stuffed pasta with chicken and the tortilla.    Staff were great!  I'd come back to try some more of the tapas!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't very friendly. We ordered altogether but received our food 15 minutes apart from each other (there were 3 of us) Small portions were overpriced and tasteless.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"WTF happened to Relish!!  the food was always predictable but good.  it's now a sad place with inedible bad food.  The bartender when asked why they were so slow on friday night responded \"people just don't love us anymore\".  wonder why the food has gone down hill so far they are serving frozen fish that is off,  spareribs that were obviously in the freezer for reheating, the once glorious  foccaccia with tomatos made in house is now a pathetic dose of stale bread with a smattering of rosemary.  The bartender said they don't make that anymore because no one is ordering it.  The grilled calamari was completely off with about 7 tablespoons of mayo and frozen cherry tomatoes.  Why?    Friday night & Joanne Clayton chef and owner no where to be seen.  There was two guys working kitchen that looked about 20 they were certainly reheating some prep left for them.     The indian tandori grilled chicken skewers tasted of nothing, they were overcooked dry and flavourless.  The asian coleslaw sat on a bed of water, bland boring.    Our bartender was friendly at first but became non chalent after we complained and returned some of the food.  He should know better then us that this place is past it's prime in fun and food.  It's depressing to see bands fill the restaurant at 9pm to bring in business.  5 years ago if you didn't have a reservation you couldn't get into the place.  68$ + tip. not worth it."}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice, more high end. I really enjoyed the decor and their music theme nights. The people were quite friendly and the service was good. The only thing was the prices were too high but it was to be expected from Toronto since the alcohol prices are so high there. It is a good place to hang out at for sure."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood place. I've never had a bad meal or snack here, and they have live music every night. It's a very comfortable and welcoming space. The owner is super musician-friendly and enthusiastic. Environmentally conscious too. While France makes headlines for banning plastic straws, Relish has banned them since 2014. They use high quality paper straws.   Come for the delicious food and drink, stay for the great music!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence to give this place four stars. My wife and I ate here just some three weeks ago to treat ourselves after a long work week. The location is quite easy to reach and stands at a corner of a side street just east of Woodbine and Danforth. Tapas is a rare find in Toronto and therefore our expectations were reasonably high. The menu has all sorts of nice stuff - squids, stuffed olives, sauteed fish bits and neat fusions of spices, marinades and bits and bites of meats. The highlight was squid with a tangy sauce and the garlic stuffed seared olives were roasted just right. A selected wine list complements the food, but some wines are north of $40 which I personally find rather pricey. This does however almost seem traditional if you view tapas in its original sense of free eats accompanying a drink or two in a tapas bar.   The reason the four stars rating was nearly missed is a) the rather expensive dishes and wine picks b) the ambience is a bit dark and depressing inside which contradicts the fresh, young and open feel to authentic tapas bars. Service was swift and the open kitchen area is a big plus for an experience worth remembering. We'd go again, once we saved up some dough :-)"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers (I had the stout). And the tapas are fun and tasty. I really liked the risotto, the gnocchi, and the beet salad. The cheese plate was a little skimpy on cheese, but had a nice selection of fruits, etc."}
{"text":"I've been going here for just over a year. The fact that I keep going back speaks for itself. Great food, staff, entertainment, and, the place is clean!!! HUGE variety of musicians. Someone different each night of the week. Can't beat karaoke Thursdays with the discounted beer prices on pints. Plus, it's on the subway line. Gotta love that."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch... Ordered the pancakes... Fluffy and filling! Patio was nice... Inside a band was playing... Made for a nice pitstop!"}
{"text":"It's a small venue and often packed.   The service is fantastic - they can handle the crowds no problem.   The food is not very good at all.   I'd stick with the cheese board."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food.  Get a martini and the risotto! Sweet live bands and cool new people in the east end.  The only really nice place on the east side!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't go often enough,but it's quite the gem. Tapas, craft beer, and live music. Need I say more? The service is great. A bit on the pricier end for this area, but worth it."}
{"text":"Really small plates/tapas for an abusive price in my opinion. Beer options are good, but also expensive. If you are hungry, this is may not be the best option."}
{"text":"This four star rating is really for the great atmosphere and entertainment. The food itself didn't make that great an impression but it is much better than most bar food. A few good beers to choose from, a good band and an excellent  system make this a nice place to spend the evening. I think this place may become my local pub.  Although it's a tapas menu, I don't really think of this place as a tapas restaurant. Its more of a local entertainment spot that happens to sell tapas. I recommend the gnocchi and advise you to stay clear of the fried ones. Definitely come for the music."}
{"text":"I live around this area, and was happy to stumble upon this bar... and subsequently to stumble out.  They have a small selection (5 taps) of high quality beer, and they seem to make a kickin Ceasar as well.  Decor is excellent for the area, possibly the best I've seen on East Danforth; ambiance and music is a fusion of old and new.  As for food, this isn't the place to go for dinner unless you have a fat wallet, or somewhere that you can expect bar food.  Relish is what I believe is called a tapas bar: smaller servings of niche foods, that are almost samples.    You will not find a burger on the menu here.  As I'm around the block, and this is the nicest bar I've seen on the eastern half of the Danforth, I can envision myself growing old at their taps...  Relish is a good place, if you want a local watering hole, with respectable spirits."}
{"text":"We had a quiet brunch here and the portions were good and they try to be inventive putting Mexican flavours on their breakfast.  I had a hash with pulled pork and poached eggs.  It was not as flavourful as I thought it could be but it was pretty filling and presented well.  This is just around my corner so I will definitely come back here and give it another try."}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Friday night with the beer passport to get a quick drink. The live band was just setting up, and the restaurant was packed. No seats available - not even standing room by the bar. We quickly grabbed our drinks at the bar, chugged them down, and left. Probably wasn't in there for more than 10 minutes.   The beer selection was alright - not a large selection, but enough to entertain most."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  They have live music all the time, amazing beer selection, and amazing food.  Places that support variety of live original music and pull off a great menu together with good beer deserve full out respect.   Cheers."}
{"text":"One of the few nice restaurants in this area of the Danforth.  Overall the plates have all been very good, on occasion have had one less then stellar out of the 7 or so we typically order.  But as another reviewer mentioned, the menu does need to change a little more frequently, really the only reason they're not getting 5 stars  You do know that you like a place when you are there often enough for the staff to recognize you and remember some of your favorites..."}
{"text":"This place is solid- good food- the calamari and beef were really delicious. Maybe a tad overpriced. Looking forward to going to check out the music, nice vibe inside."}
{"text":"this was a first. last night, monday, i left a restaurant after eating a $14 entrée and i was hungry on the ride home.  the tale starts this past saturday. i took a group of us - 7 and a toddler - for 11:30 saturday birthday brunch to relish. my eldest recommended it mostly for the gluten free menu.  we got there and most places in my experience when they say they open at a certain time that is when they are ready to serve guests.  this place at 11:30 was all dark except for one guy in the open kitchen. we followed the waitress in as she unlocked the door and turned on the lights.  it took about 45 minutes to get the first bits of food. my chorizo soup was anemic but i was well pleased with their cubano sandwich on gluten free bread. very nice.   nice enough to come back 2 days later for the same.  unfortunately they don't do sandwiches during the week and we were stuck with what i think are their overly fancy menu offerings trying to punch way above their weight in what is essentially a dumpy bar. [panama joe's on the danforth 25 years ago did this 1000 times better.]  so i had what seemed pretty simple. a chicken roulade. $14. chicken breast 'filled' with spinach, smokey provolone and roasted red peppers.  what arrived and again after an interminable wait was a six inch long by almost two inch wide piece of chicken breast drowned in bland sauce, some hardly discernible provolone and not enough red pepper or spinach to make it from one end of the breast to the other.  it arrived - sorry i did not have the wherewithal to take a pic - on a small rectangular plate, i used to have bigger ashtrays, cut into 5 barely two bite pieces so i could even see there was no red pepper etc in the end pieces.  for $14 this was it. no salad, no slaw, no accompaniment. nothing. [the $11 cubano sandwich came with fries or substitute small salad.]  pretty sad fare and actually shameful in my opinion. less faux fancy, heartier fare and adequate portions will make for a much more satisfying meal experience imo.  this should be a one star review but the gf offerings and the great sandwich make the place barely two stars."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times and it's always been good, not spectacular, but good. However, the menu hasn't changed in a while. Last time was a bit ho-hum, seems like relish is getting somewhat complacent"}
{"text":"We've been to Relish a number of times as it is within walking distance from our house, and are always impressed.  We've dined with our family which includes, vegetarian, non-fish eaters, non-seafood eaters, gluten-free, and meat-seafood lovers, and we always have no trouble ordering many dishes so everyone is pleased in the end.  The staff are fun, nice and helpful, and the ambiance nice.  There is a cool little lounge which used to be in the back, but now in the front window. It's small, and sometimes a bit squishy.  Cozy I say!  Our favourite dish is definitely the wild mushroom risotto, and I also really love the grilled calamri. The gluten free desserts are to die for."}
{"text":"Great beer and wine selection. Lovely tappas style menu. A tiny bit pricey...I think the quality of the food is worh the cost but the bill climbs quickly so it makes it hard to stay all night.  I think we need more places like this one in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Nice bar, good atmosphere, with a variety of live music. Have eaten here a few times. Food is good but portions are tiny & high priced. If you are looking for good value, skip this place & go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"A gem in the city. A must fir fans of good food, great beer and awesome music. The service is superior and the staff are friendly.."}
{"text":"This is my first time to this place, I came here for lunch with some co-workers. I must say that I really like the selection and the variety of the menu, the music, and the atmosphere.   The food is why I go anywhere! So when I came here I was not sure what to expect so I ordered many things. Been very familiar with a tapas style meal, I wanted to try and see what their take on it was. The mix of food ranges from Spanish to Greek to Italian and everything in between. My favorites where the beef on a bun, the lamb skewer, and the chorizo taco. The dessert are not bad, the banana bread putting is great, the sambuka cremebrule.   The music was actually great! I was here during the day time so it was just playing on the speakers. I am told that during the evening there is live music and its usually Jazz, I absolutely love Jazz! So naturally now I have to come back! Our server was very nice, she knew the menu very well and was happy to offer suggestions, and she actually has tried the food and had an opinion about the varieties. I will now have to come back when during the evening."}
{"text":"I had the lobster potstickers, chicken roulade and the tortilla shell. Really liked the vibe in the place, service was quick and friendly without being over bearing. The food is good, didn't blow me away but it's a cool place to go for some tapas.   I went with a friend and there was a live band playing which I thought was really cool. Definitely a cool spot to hang out with a friend or your other half. I plan on returning soon! :)"}
{"text":"Good reliable food. Tapas sized portions, meant for sharing.  We tend to get 2 - 3 orders per person, so with 4 people we usually end up with 10 small plates over a couple of hours.  I have to order the \"Sage Crepe stuffed w/ butternut squash, mascarpone & sage butter\" for myself, as I c.a.n.n.o.t. bring myself to share it.  Tooooo good.  I could try to replicate it at home, but for $6, why bother.  Toothy awesomeness for not much more than the cost of a Happy Meal - nothing to think about there.  The crowd can be a bit uppity if there are too many people from the south of the Danny enclaves, but overall nice group of customers.  The wait staff occasionally seem a bit too pleased with themselves, but I'm not going for their preciousness, I am there for the food and the good company I'm bringing with me.   The place is quite receptive to kids, though screaming isn't appreciated by anyone."}
{"text":"Ah Relish, my second attempt at going there for a relaxing drink. It is the closest eatablishment  by the way amd I hoped for a neighbourly feel.  There was any type of feeling lacking here at all. I paid for my first pint  in cash and all was well. My second, however required a debit transaction and suddenly there was a problem. Not only was I told that I needed to spend at least 20 bucks but the bartender insisted on taking my card with him....a debit card to start a tab. Ok...a little irked but fine..finished pint. Waited for table service and noone coming around. Finally i walk to the bar and say hey...how about you hook me up with 2 and then i can pay my bill and leave when i would like to.  No. This is when he says....hey...im not comfortable giving you 2 drinks because i dont know how much you had before this. What! So youre questioning my integrity and holding my card hostage until i hit 20 bucks? When i stupidly answer that ive had 2 drinks prior, his answer is \"hey..i dont know you..i dont know you\" i had no clue that names and history were mandatory. I wasnt even close to drunk, i wasnt behaving in any manner differeng than anyone else.  I walked back to my table feeling awkward and shocked. I am now in this one sided power struggle. His suggestion as a way out was to use the atm at the back. Um...no! Im not going to pay 5 bucks to withdraw money when you have debit. Even the dollar store takes the hit on bank fees..i think your overpriced pints and understaffed establishment will be fine. So after talking to him onve more....he sees that im getting upset and says hey, listen i càn charge you for 2 and put it on debit. Deal? Really? What a saviour....seriously the hit on my integrity and a jab at my character was so not worth this attempt. Relsh was what i thought it was..a snotty, hipster, bourgie wanna be place that should move uptown and be amongst their peers. Disappointing...so disappointing"}
{"text":"Went to Relish last night 24th Feb with my girlfriend, arrived at 6pm, place was pretty much empty, so we chose a table, with the help of a staff member, about 20ft from Artists stage. We both had drinks and food, music started at 7pm, we were having a great time, it was our first proper date, until approx 8.15, a member of staff came to the table and told us we would have to vacate the table at 8.30 as it was reserved, bear in mind we could have had any table at 6pm and had we been told it was reserved, would of picked another. Anyway the only option we were given was to sit at the bar which was not a nice option at all. To cut a long story short we paid the bill left our drinks and will not be going back there. Hopefully anyone thinking of visiting this place will think twice, wish i had, not very happy."}
{"text":"Nothing terribly special about this place as far as grabbing a bar drink goes. First impression it seems old and dingy, decor looks around 90's. My wife and I were on a pub crawl one night after looking at a house to buy in the area. It was our last stop. When you have places like The Wren, the Borough, Sauce, Local 1749 close by this place just doesn't cut the taste buds for overall fun. Maybe it's just my style :)"}
{"text":"Pros: Live music was good and the servers were nice.   Cons: Drinks were overpriced but not by too much. However, this place absolutely kills you on the prices of their dishes. The food is served in tiny portions for high prices. I would obviously be fine with this if the food was exceptional but it's average at best.  Don't come here to eat, come here if you want live music and don't mind slightly pricey drinks."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal there, with lots of veg friendly options. The tapas are write large so we ended up over ordering a bit.   There is live music in most nights for a more fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Friday night for drinks.  Really impressed with their selection on tap and pints in the $7 range.  They had a small stage and a band playing for entertainment.  I was too full to try any thing from the food menu but eyed other tables' dishes and everything looked/smelled good.  Loved this cozy little bar on the East end...we need a location in the West!"}
{"text":"I popped in expecting this to be a dive bar, but I was surprised to discover an excellent selection of beers on tap and a menu that had nothing to do with typical bar food. I won't pretend I wasn't disappointed that they didn't have cheap nachos, but I was impressed by their selection of tapas and the fact that they're a bar with so many vegan and vegetarian options.  If you like live music, this is the place for you.  This is a great spot to stop in and get a drink and hang out."}
{"text":"Checked out Relish on a Sunday open mic night...the place was busy and had a great energy.  We has tap beer and tapas and was pleased with our service and selection tonight.  The food and tap selection was great and very good but a bit on the high side of pub fare.  Would certainly go back for another entertaining evening when on the Danforth.  Check it out you should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place.  It's all about the music here and everyone is super friendly.  Great selection of beers but the food could use some improvement.   Although it is a tapas menu, I find the food to be somewhat over priced and not that interesting.   The energy of the place makes up for this though and it's one of the better small music venues in my neighbourhood."}
