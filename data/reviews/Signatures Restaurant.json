{"text":"Great place for having good conversation but agree with most that the food is only average.  In fact, I enjoyed my appertizer (grilled calamari) a lot more than my entr√©e (meatball pappardelle).  Service was nonetheless prompt and friendly and the location is also great.  I might be back to try their breakfast/brunch, but probably not for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I were hosting visiting delegates from Hong Kong and decided to make reservations here for lunch. Its proximity to the university and affiliation with the Intercontinental made it an excellent choice for our purposes.   When we arrived, we were greeted promptly by the hostess and taken to our table. The restaurant was completely empty, odd for a Friday afternoon, but the quiet was welcome as we expected to have good conversation.   The service was prompt and efficient, which was great for a business lunch. Water glasses were filled often and the complimentary bread was quite fresh.   As a vegetarian, I found just one main option on their entire menu - ravioli. Having said that, it sounded good so I decided to give it a go. The ravioli itself was lovely. Subtle flavours and creamy texture. The vegetables atop the ravioli though were thoroughly bland. The peas and carrots tasted as though they had been frozen and microwaved, while the other vegetables were uninspired.   Overall, the service was great and the ambiance was good for a business meeting where conversation is important. The food itself though, especially given the price, left something to be desired."}
{"text":"I had dinner here while staying in the hotel for a business trip. Unfortunately, I only took half of the host's suggestions. The Duck Magret (recommended), was absolutely incredible. My trout entree, however, was underwhelming as was the bread pudding. Given that the bill came to around $100, I wouldn't recommend spending your money here."}
{"text":"Plus: staff was reallyyyy friendly and nice to us :)  down: food was mediocre. i had spaghetti and it was bland. I could have  cooked better spaghetti myself. dessert, which was a chocolate mousse, was really sweet.  came here for summerlicious 2011. but kind of regret it."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious dinner. Food was very sub par especially considering the price. I wish I was exaggerating in saying I'd rather go to McDonald's. Not worth your money considering the fantastic cuisine in Toronto."}
{"text":"My third restaurant for Summerlicious 2010.  It's funny how my restaurants went from \"amazing to crappy\" in the end.    I went with my coworkers last Friday at lunch.  There wasn't many people - so I thought the service was going to be somewhat fast (since it was a weekday and the lot of us had to go back to work).   Surprisingly, the bread was quite amazing there, so I can't complain about that.  I got myself the following: - Poached Atlantic Salmon - Forest Mushroom & White Asparagus Risotto - Banana Fritter Parfait  The poached atlantic salmon was okay.  I didn't like the yogurt dressing on top -- it was too sour and didn't match the salmon very well.  The risotto was horrific.  It was too creamy and I just couldn't finish it.  My coworker as well.  The funny thing is that on the menu, it said cherry tomatoes would be part of the dish - and there was NO TOMATOES.  The dessert was okay - but I felt like I could've walked into any Japanese restaurant, ordered ice cream, and tempura bananas and I would've ended up with the same concoction.  The funniest thing was this:  I went to my friend's place the other day and he showed me HIS pictures of his Summerlicious lunch at Signatures two weeks prior.  The plating and presentation was MUCH nicer than my lunch with my coworkers.  Could it be possible that they just gave up along the timespan of Summerlicious?  I felt gypped."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place is so underrated.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  We came here for summerlicious.  I had the Truffle Caesar which was good but was missing the duck egg which I was trying to look for.  The main was the Angus burger which is a very big burger and it was delicious.  The dessert was the chocolate mousse which was also the star of the meal.  This meal was very good value and will come again although the service was rather slow."}
{"text":"Sad.  This very wonderful hotel has a very obvious restaurant problem.  The service was astonishingly bad and the food just better than average.  The atmosphere is nice enough.  There is a hip pastel-chalk menu written at the very attractive entrance.  As soon as you enter, you realize something is wrong.  We stood there for a full five minutes before anyone greeted us and then I would not call it much of a greeting.  There were few diners in the restaurant but no staff visible anywhere while we were waiting.  Another patron was waiting outside the kitchen door, hoping to get some service.  When a staff person did come out, it seemed like it was her first day.  She did not know where to seat us, there were about 40 empty tables.  After disappearing for a while, she came back with a small pad to take our order and was unfamiliar with the menu, the English language and how to ask a co-worker for help.  She then returned three times to clarify our order and then a fourth time, fully twenty minutes after our order to tell us they were out of an essential ingredient and could not make some of the food.  I thought we were on camera.  When we finally asked to speak to the manager, a harried and unprofessional woman emerged and only nodded as she heard our tale.  She then asked strangely if we would like some water to make things right.  ???  After more vociferous complaining (to which we are not accustomed), she refunded the cost of the meal.  We did speak to the hotel manager who was very wonderful as was the rest of the hospitality staff at this otherwise terrific hotel."}
