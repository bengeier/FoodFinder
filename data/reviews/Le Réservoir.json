{"text":"went for sunday brunch donuts with berry puree were out of this world. service is slow but thats typical french montreal style. housemade beers looked great. very crowded as a teestament to high quality food. also got pancakes that were delicious."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how poor this place was given its Yelp rating at the time of our visit.

We came here around 4pm the first time, excited for a little dinner-time munch and some good beer. We were informed by the kind waitress that we were too early for the kitchen. Okay - whatcha got? Drinks, nuts, and olives to hold you off. Great, we'll take a drink and some olives.

I had a disappointing cream ale. The girlfriend tried their take on a szarlotka. I'm Polish-American, and my first proper drink was a szarlotka in Poland with ?ubrówka and fresh apple juice. They were using decent bison grass vodka, because this szarlotka was well-balanced and tasty for a surprise appearance in a Montréal brewpub.

We told the waitress that we would go to the thrift store on the corner to pass the remaining 45 minutes or so. After leaving my debit card with her, we set off. When we came back, our street-view table next to the window had been given to another couple. I was a touch upset that our items had been moved.

Girlfriend gestured that since I was irritated, we should just leave. It didn't help that when the bill came, the small (ketchup-container-sized) dish of past-prime olives (see other reviews - our visit confirmed that their olives are indeed _not_ fresh) had cost us five dollars. I had been put off enough by the fact that the olives served to keep our taste buds busy were frankly unappetizing. But to charge five bucks for them takes some gall!

Lastly - and the main reason for two, rather than three, stars - this place is a brewpub, and their beer simply isn't very good. We returned (myself, a bit sourly) to the restaurant to meet some friends. It was around seven p.m. on a Thursday and all they had to eat was fish and chips and a sandwich or two. Okay, fine, beer for me. All I could drink was the stout, which was bitterly unbalanced, lacking in body and mouthfeel, and generally of poor flavor. The environment was loud and uncomfortable, spatially poorly-arranged, and insufficiently lit (even for a dim night-time bar experience, the lighting was poorly executed).

I don't mean to be overly critical of this place. Really. As a general principal, when I find things to dislike, I search harder for the merit in those things. Réservoir left me amiss as to the reason for their reputation. I _love_ beer. It's my first love before scotch, wine, brandy and cigars. If you're looking for a spot for good food and great beer - avoid this place, do yourself a favor, and visit the nearby (~10 blocks or so) Dieu du Ciel. They live up to their high ratings in every capacity."}
{"text":"Great place, good selection of beers and amazing food..... One of the best foods I have had. Must try the tacos.....
Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"My family of 7 was in town from Ohio. My wife and I LOVE breweries. We were so pleased. Our bartender supplied us with several pints and churros and chips. He was super friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We just had the best lunch! We shared the fried potatoes with aioli- so delicious- then I had the buttermilk salad and my son had the fried chicken. He said it was great- it sure looked good. This is a comfortable friendly spot with perfect service and yummy food . We will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great but the service was not so great. The drink selection was great. The food selection and presentation was great but it was a little overpriced and extremely oily, I was sick the rest of the night after dinner. Cool place to hang with your bros but not so cool as a dining experience."}
{"text":"Pretentious and Awkward.

The seating arrangement in Resevoir is nothing short of awkward, affording little privacy from adjacent parties, and generally uncomfortable.

While the beer selection is okay, it's nothing special, and the food is unremarkable and over priced.

If you're looking for a spot to grab a pint in the neighbourhood, you could do a lot better."}
{"text":"Really cool bar with house-brewed IPAs and a GREAT upstairs lounge area.

When I was visiting Montreal for a long weekend in the winter, we were on a bar stroll that led to Reservoir at about 6 PM. We were only expecting to be there for a drink or so, but 3 hours later we found ourselves ordering beer after beer and kicking back on these great chairs upstairs.

Snacks were solid, crowd was interesting...I'd definitely stop by next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"We've been there twice for bruch. Had the omelette and the pancakes. The pancakes come with an apple spread and diced strawberries mixed in. Absolutely delicious! There's more fancy stuff on the menu but we haven't tried them yet. We haven't got to taste the beers either so it will be for some other time but we were pleased with the ambiance, the crowd and the location. There is more to discover at this place so we will back.
With regards to service, we agree it's on the slow side. You may not want to go there if you're starving and/or on a rush."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff, great location and unpretentious. And most importantly, great beer! This has been a new favorite local place to go on any night of the week. There are no TV screens so you don't have to put up with hockey fans!"}
{"text":"This is my date spot. Nice place - they keep it simple. Earthy, lots of wood. They have a few beer options, and they are all great. Brewed there. The food is tasty, but you don't go here for dinner. Attentive staff and friendly vibe. Great place to sit, chat, drink and snack."}
{"text":"Had brunch here in the afternoon.  Their changing menus are really awesome.  I got the grilled mackerel with grilled veggies and a lovely lobster sauce.  My companion got the salmon with veggies and a citrus-y sauce.  The salmon was good and the mackerel was excellent.  

They are really good with their sauces there, which is often over looked in other restaurants.  Very experimental, but when they get it right, it's delicious!  

Menu was only in french though."}
{"text":"I have been there several times, usually for beers, but on occasion for brunch...and wow! They know how to titillate the most difficult taste bud. I had an asparagus benedictine and my \"date\"  a salmon dish. It was wonderful. It is not cheap, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great halloumi sandwich, extremely friendly service and great ambience! Visited on a Thursday and was busy but not full. Good beer selection and a great but small vegetarian menu."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a chef that I met while he was on vacation in Boston. His other restaurant, which is equally if not more impressive, is La Salle a Manger. He left Reservoir to open La Salle.

Reservoir is amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxed with a \"community\" feel to it. Coming from restaurants in Boston which are usually rushed it was nice to have a relaxing brunch that lasted about two hours. I know that long meals aren't for everyone but the staff was attentive without being encroaching. 

The menu: it is only in French but if you don't speak french just ask! I'm told that the menu switches pretty often, at least with each season.

The food: everything we had was amazing but my two favorites were the Pork Belly with corn/tomato salsa and the beignets with blueberry puree. Both the omelet with lobster mushrooms and crepes were equally delicious. 

The beer: I only had the Blanche which was great, it would be worth coming here in the middle of the afternoon just for a snack and a beer!

I would recommend this to anyone, both native and tourist! Coming from out of town it was nice to get out of the \"touristy\" areas and to eat somewhere that felt much more authentic and real. 10 times better then you are going to find in Old Port.

Hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"Great place to have  drinks and munch. It's laid back, simple, not too expensive. The food is pretty good, especially fish and chips (well, fries). great beer, good music, nice waiters. What's there not to like?"}
{"text":"Great cafe/restaurant. Unique food. We had the sweetbreads, trout, fish and corriander bites, and the chorizo. All very good. Flavourful beer."}
{"text":"If this restaurant were in Toronto I would have taken a star off for the laid back and easy going service. We are tense people that like to have food shoveled into our faces quickly so we can get back to feeling important and busy. So I say thank goodness Reservoir is not located in Toronto.

The food was perfectly prepared with maximum flavour and a killer presentation. I usually have eggs benny at new places as a gauge for how good they are. It's not a tough dish to make but it's still easy to screw up or cheap out on (packaged hollandaise or frozen asparagus/spinach for instance). I'm happy to say that it was delicious. Two eggs set on top of leeks with a little tea biscuit of some kind. The sauce was perfect and it came with a slab of bacon that melted in my mouth.

The servers were sweet and attentive and helped make the restaurant feel comfortable and welcoming. There is no rushing here and no one telling you to finish up and make way for more customers. It was wonderful.

I can't wait to come back and try out the micro brew."}
{"text":"Au sein du plateau Mont-Royal, cette petite brasserie artisanale aux allures contemporaines et branchées a un petit quelque chose bien à elle, qui s'explique peut-être en partie dans la promiscuité qu'oblige sa petitesse. Calme en après-midi et agitée en soirée, le Réservoir est un endroit qui s'affiche discrètement sur la liste des brasseries montréalaises. Pourtant elle mérite le détour, ne serait-ce que pour goûter les produits qu'elle propose.

Leurs bières anonymes, uniquement définies par le genre (Noire, Rousse, Blonde, Blanche, Scotch Ale, Weizen, etc.) ne sont pas pour autant sans âme. La Blonde (Pilesener), très céréalière et anormalement limpide, semble cependant avoir été étouffée par une montagne de houblon, comme si l'on avait voulu cacher quelconque anomalie gustative... La bière aux cerises se démarque du lot.

Les plats sont assez élaborés; le ragoût de pieuvre et chorizo ou encore l'assiette de fromage, pour ne nommer que ceux-là, tenteront sans doute les adeptes de tentacules et de moisissures bon goût... 

Le verre n'est que 3,50$

Bonne machine à espresso..."}
{"text":"Bless you, Le Reservoir. I love beer and vegetarian food and you have both. Came in for a couple pints and some vegetarian poutine. I was not disappointed!

This is the kind of place a non-vegetarian might not even notice the lack of meat on the menu."}
{"text":"Sitting here waiting for the past hour for my tacos to come.. I'm hungry and there is no one in sight to even ask for our food.. Leaving now as the server told us that haven't yet started the taco. tired of waiting."}
{"text":"Great micro-brewery, delicious beers - my fave being the IPA Citra - very lively and casual ambience and tasty vegetarian food. What's not to like? 

We visited Reservoir twice during our week in Montreal, once around 10pm and the place was buzzing, the second time this afternoon at around 4pm and again it was a fun and lively atmosphere. Great selection of music too and it's played loud enough to enjoy but not blasted so loud that you can't even have a conversation. 

On our second visit we ordered food and it was really tasty - very savoury and filling. Another plus point.

What's more, coming from Vancouver with its relentless and frustrating obsession for filling each wall of a bar with multiple widescreen TVs, Reservoir - and indeed most bars in Montreal - are a welcome and refreshing change!

Highly recommend and, if we were staying longer, we'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the breakfast but for dinner/drinks at 830 p....
- it's very loud
- the tables are sticky
- there is no English menu (although that's not uncommon)
- the dinner sandwhiches are surprisingly small, no fries incl. but it was tasty, have the fish and chips. It's bigger. 
- food was fast to the table 
- beer selection very weak and the Blanche was watery"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Town. Unusual combinations but always fantastic. Service is often with an attitude which is my only negative point. Be prepared for line ups on sat & sun mornings."}
{"text":"J'adore vraiment ce brasserie. Toutes les bières sont bonnes. Je ne sais même plus ça fait combien de fois que je vais là. Mes plus belles soirées se passent toujours chez Réservoir. Côté bouffe, ils ont changé d'administration avant les temps des fêtes. C'est la gang d'Hôtel Herman qui a pris la relève; et vraiment je crois que c'est un match parfait. Longue vie au Réservoir 2.0!"}
{"text":"6e arrêt du Passeport en fût. J'avoue avoir été déçue. J'avais énormément entendu parler du Réservoir en bien et ça faisait longtemps que je voulais l'essayer. Premièrement, j'ai demandé conseil au serveur pour ma bière. Je lui ai demandé s'ils avaient une bière fumée et il m'a conseillé une stout à l'avoine et m'a dit que l'IBU était faible, j'ai donc opté pour cette option plutôt qu'une blanche qui avait l'air très bonne. Et je fus déçue parce que ce n'était pas du tout une bière fumée et l'amertume me laisse croire que l'IBU était bien plus élevé que ce que m'avait promis le serveur bien sympathique malgré ça! Mon mari a pris une bière (dont je ne me rappelle plus le nom) qui était excellente mais moi j'ai bu la moitié de la mienne, une première! L'ambiance est bien et le bar très bien situé mais je ne trouve pas qu'il se démarque des autres micro-brasseries de Montréal."}
{"text":"After not having visited reservoir in a long time (too long!) I've recently popped in a few times and have wondered why I waited so long. This is micro-brew pub done right. A relaxed vibe. Decent music. And most important of all: good beer! Nothing too \"out there\", just solid beers. I'm partial to the pilsner and the saison été myself, but drinking companions have commented on the quality of the blanche and the cream ale as well. Something else Reservoir does well is their food. A step above the standards nuts or olives (though they have them as well), they have goodies like homemade chips and calamari. This is the perfect place to drop in with a friend to catch up while drinking a pint."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Reservoir over the weekend while attending a bachelor party in Montreal. On their website, it is described as a \"Brasserie artisanale.\"

My translation for that would be \"tapas beer bar.\" The atmosphere is trendy and hipster, with plenty of tattooed waitstaff. They have a rooftop terrace, which we took full advantage of.

They offer a good selection (~7) of their own microbrews, covering most beer categories. I opted for the Saison which was crisp, clean and nicely carbonated. They also have a few different wine selections. 

Unfortunately, we did not sample any food. However, the items coming out of the kitchen looked amazing, especially the tacos.

The service was great and the bartenders were all friendly. Maybe it's a Canadian thing? Anyways, Reservoir is a great venue to enjoy food and drinks with friends. The outdoor rooftop seating is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Microbreweries are synonymous with wineries with regards to quality and this place stays on par with those expectations. I got lucky to get a table in their balcony this past summer. My favorite beer was the dry stout. This place has high quality beer and is located right in the Plateau which is another plus. Didn't get a chance to try any of their apps therefore will reserve reviewing those."}
{"text":"Un petit bar cozy avec une belle ambiance où on s'entend parler! Je vous recommande cette place si vous avez une date! Si vous voulez faire le Party, ce n'est pas la place où ça va lever."}
{"text":"food is very good. staff is very friendly. one rainy night they were catering to a party upstairs and gave me free soup and other tidbits when i was at the bar alone. but honestly, the beer is ho-hum. i take people here we need to compromise: good food and decent beer. because there are much better restaurants (with poor beer selection) and better brewpubs (with horrible food) in town."}
{"text":"Bon spot, surtout pour la terrasse sur le toit l'été, arrivez tôt pour réservez votre place. Les accras de morue sont excellent et évidemment les amoureux de bière seront servis. Pour ceux qui n'aiment pas la bière, le choix de vin et cocktails est assez limité. Les brunch sont aussi bons, vous aurez plusieurs raisons d'essayer la place :)"}
{"text":"Entre amis, pour un verre ou des encas ... copieux, avant d'aller vous déhancher sur un rock au Divan Orange, le Réservoir est un endroit PAR-FAIT.
Tables en bois, dont les nervures sont usées par les caresses des clients, sont dispersées dans une petite salle intime et chaleureuse, dont la baie vitrée donne sur une petite rue calme.

Le Réservoir, c'est d'abord une microbrasserie. Je vous déconseille l'excentricité. La bière au chocolat, bon, c'est sympa pour l'expérience, mais franchement, c'est vite écoeurant. Rabattez-vous plutôt sur les rousses ou les blondes, dont la diversité est déconcertante : \"Ah mais je sais pas quoi choisiiiir, y'a trop de choiiiix\". White problem you know ...

Mais le Réservoir, c'est aussi ... DE LA BONNE BOUFFE. Mon dieu. Nous étions 10 à table ce soir là, personne n'a pris la même chose. De la planche de charcuterie aux escargots, en passant par le brownie (en totalité englouti par ma personne malgré la taille gargantuesque), tout était excellent. Les produits sont frais, bien présentés...

À tous les gens qui cherchent du bon fromage à un prix raisonnable dans cette grande ville qu'est Montréal, vous avez désormais une adresse !

Bref, je suis tombée en amour avec cet endroit à jamais."}
{"text":"Super tiny and cute.. pretty sure the menu is mostly vegetarian and my husband needs meat  so we just tried all the beers along with frites and mayo.. def recommend this place if you want a casual drink, in a cozy environment"}
{"text":"Definitely get the Veggie Poutine.  It was delish. The rooftop terrace was also great.  We went here twice in our 4 day trip to Montreal.  Lots of options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"So, it seems, Reservoir has gone vegetarian.
Beer and a veggie-burger, guys? Oh yay! :-/
They do have squid rings, true, but that's not really enough to satisfy your average meat loving person for longer than it takes to quaff one of their micro-brewed beers.

That's as long as we stayed there - one beer- so there's not much more to report except for the almost eerie lack of men in the place."}
{"text":"For someone who has lived in the city all their life it's amazing to see the evolution of this place! From just serving Tapas and great beer to now having full dinner and brunch. 

This is city is all about knowing where to eat brunch and Reservoir is a perfect answer to this question. Seriously out of this world brunch with a heavy emphasis on the lunch in brunch. 

We sat down and had some scrumptious eats while ordering a beer at 10:30. DO IT, Its worth it! Get there early, 10:30 is a great time to arrive since the place fills up fast for brunch."}
{"text":"Un bon brunch en famille ou entre amis, l'endroit propose un menu original, comprenant du boudin noir, un fish n' chip d'aiglefin, un grilled cheese au bacon bien gras et salé ou encore une délicieuse omelette aux pleurottes."}
{"text":"Pas mal. Je définirais mieux : sympa mais sans plus. 
J'ai vraiment adoré le hummus par contre j'ai eu du mal à trouvé bière à mon pied (heu bière à ma bouche ... bref!). Pas hyper convaincue dirons nous. 
Le cadre est sympa, les prix sont un peu élevés il me semble : le menu sur leur site internet fait état de prix moins élevés (2CAD de moins pour tous les plats à la carte).
Si je pouvais je mettrais 3,5 car sur présentation du passeport en fût, il offre une pinte de bière en fut dans tous les choix, ce qui n'est pas le cas de tous les lieux participant à l'opération donc je trouve que c'est bien de le signaler !"}
{"text":"Chill place, i forgot what kind of red wine i had but it was very fruity and sweet. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"FYI: this is no longer a vegetarian restaurant. The beer, food, and ambience are still great, and they still have a couple of vegetarian options (grilled cheese, salad,...), but if you're looking for the pre-2017 full vegetarian menu, this is no longer the place for you."}
{"text":"There's no shortage of great microbreweries in Montreal, but there is one gem that is definitely worth trying out. Tucked into the corner of Duluth, just off of St. Laurent is Reservoir, an excellent place with incredible beers.

I'm a stout girl, there's no doubt about it and the Noire a L'avoine has everything I look for in an oatmeal stout: smooth, rich and creamy with a perfect bitterness factor. 

And great head; never underestimate the power of great head. The Cream Ale is a great choice for those of you looking for something light, smooth and easy drinking. If hops are more your thing, then the house India Pale Ale does not disappoint. The Scotch Ale is like caramel butter in your mouth: so, so good.

They also have 750ml bottles and I highly recommend their Saison, a strong Belgian style that is perfect for any time of day, and any type of weather. With two floors, a sweet upper terrace, exposed brick and appropriate chalkboard décor, and not to mention its stellar location, this place would be worth checking out even if the beer was half as good. (I hear the food is pretty great too.)

Reservoir: Home of great beer."}
{"text":"New to the Plateau I quickly discovered this gem.
Excellent, fresh food that reaches beyond bar food. Tuna tataki with salad and bacon? Amazing. Mushroom and mozzarella tart with balsamic reduction? I'm craving it right now.  
Small wine by the glass selection but it rotates often enough and the staff are knowledgeable on this point and will help you choose. 
Always a cool crowd in the evenings. Upstairs terrace (no smoking). Chill music playing every time.
Good for any night of the week - go check it out."}
{"text":"Both times that we went here over the long weekend, the upstairs area was not open but they made up for it by having their Saison beer on draft which they generally only have in bottles.  The Saison beer was superbly light but a smooth slightly fruity after taste and it WAS 6.4% ABV!  It was a great summer beer.  The pale ale beer was also very good!  We also got appetizers one night.  We ended up getting the cheese plate and the scallop ceviche.  I enjoy all types of ceviche and this scallop ceviche was exellent and the portion was big.  You could have also gotten Quebec lobster as an add-on in the ceviche but we passed.   Our local Montreal friends had never seen ceviche on the menu.  Their menu was a chalk board which changed and was very limited.  IMO, a limited menu means that they do everything well rather than you trying to figure out what they do well out of dozens of selections.  This is a divey bar with great beer and a very casual meal if that is what you are looking for in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Le cadre est magnifique, il faut tester ce bar sur Duluth!  L'été vous capoterez sur la terrasse tout en bois et pourrez apprécier le calme et la sympathie du quartier! 
Par contre, il vous faudra arriver tôt pour réussir à obtenir une table et aimer la promiscuité car sur la terrasse on est un peu les uns sur les autres! 
Le service est bon, les serveurs sont de bons conseils s'agissant de la micro brasserie et vous permettent de tester certaines bières avant de commander!
Les plats à partager sont très bons mais pas très copieux...nous avons testé les accras qui étaient vraiment top avec leur petite sauce verte! 
Le petit bémol lorsqu'on est sur la terrasse...c'est qu'on profite des fumées de cigarettes des clients qui se mettent juste devant l'entrée pour fumer! Ca c'est assez pénible!"}
{"text":"Even though I gave 5 stars last time, the service seemed even better today. Maybe it's because this time I sat up at the bar so I was definitely attended to much faster and had direct access to anything I needed from the servers. I ordered my usual pint of Weizen beer (although I wish I tried their cherry beer, instead) as well as a gruyere grilled cheese sandwich that, unlike last time, included a thick slab of bacon too. 

As usual, I'm very pleased with this place. I look forward to pushing my boundaries on my next visit and trying new food/drinks that they have to offer, which I don't doubt will be anything short of perfect and satisfying."}
{"text":"Choix de bière intéressant, menu varié. Les fish & chips, les tartares, frites et cie sont un incontournable"}
{"text":"Can be very busy but was not this Sunday at 11am for brunch. Got packed less than an hour later.

The brunch menu features a selection of fairly unusual fares, of which I picked the roasted Piglet Flank. It's 5pm and I am still dazed. Yes, it was that good! Every detail was well thought-out. 

Coffee was great, service was courteous and friendly. Don't expect any Cora-style brunch items, but if you're open-minded, you'll be surprised and delighted."}
{"text":"This place was recommended as a favorite bar of Montreal by a local, and I couldn't agree more! I came here for a late night drink with friends, and was so happy that I tried it out. 

A laid-back atmosphere with an incredibly friendly staff. The microbrews are to die for, the Weizen (that may be incorrect in spelling) being my favorite. It's a lighter beer with a very unique taste. The Cream Ale was also a favorite in the group. I personally didn't order any food, but everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious. 

To Non-French speakers-- beware that the menus are only in French. Not a huge deal, as at least one of the bartenders will help you out in English. 

Be sure to check out the upstairs-- the space was incredible with mood lighting and group tables to facilitate the laid back mood. The brick interior housed French doors that opened up to an outdoor patio with seating. I wish I had come in the summertime, as that would have been quite the treat. Overall, if you're looking for a relaxing place to catch up with friends, Réservoir is the place to be!"}
{"text":"They make their own beer. Beer and wine are okay. In regards to food, we were so happy to find a place that has delicious and flavourful food! We tried their tacos, churros, watermelon salad and flatbread. We usually don't eat that much but considering the flavours were explosive (yes!) and original, we got loose. Definitely a five because my boyfriend and I have already agreed that we are bringing our non-vegeterian friends here. Ambiance is cozy and no one acts overly pretentious."}
{"text":"Belle microbrasserie avec de la bouffe 4 étoiles!!! Enfin car c'est plutot rare...

J'y ai déjà mangé une joue de veau assez fabuleuse. Pas donné meme le midi mais bon.. C'est bon! Portions légère...."}
{"text":"Went here looking for a pint. They had only a few drinks on tap but they were all good. Try the blonde, very full flavor. The bartenders were very friendly. My group was from out of town and it was obvious. Got several free drinks from other patrons and we returned the favor. We didn't try the food  but definitely stop by and sit at the small bad to interact with the locals."}
{"text":"From the good reviews here and elsewhere, we drove straight from the border to this cafe, arriving about 1:30pm for lunch on a Thursday.  Although it did concern me that the majority of the reviewers of Reservoir were from other cities, I was pleasantly surprised that this place did not cater to tourists by giving us a french-only menu.

We sat by the window on the main floor and the place was half-empty.  I echo the sentiments of Al A that the service was extremely slow.  I ordered the braised pork with fennel salad and peanut sauce, while my wife had the salmon fish and chips.  About 30 minutes after we ordered, that server came over and told us that the chef overcooked my pork.  I suppose it's a good thing that he didn't serve me a piece of overcooked pork.  In the interim, they brought us out the soup of the day, which was a cold crab/yuzu soup - this was dynamite.

The salmon was surprisingly not as heavy as I expected.  Nice light batter but crispy.  The chips were excellent - perfectly seasoned and crispy.  My pork was a little disappointing.  It was definitely a little overcooked and dry - I suppose the chef was having some difficulties that day.  

Three and half stars, but I rounded up because of the honesty of the server, and they greatness of the french fries and soup."}
{"text":"The Rose was horrible. When we rejected it and said it was actually \"turned\" we were told \"well this is not your typical Rose\". Why would you not mention that when we ordered it? The service leaves MUCH to be desired. There are plenty of other places to go to in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking cute! The food is absolutely delicious. I had the pizza & the vegan Mac, as well as the carrot cake & everything was incredible. Would highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour une bière, et avons eu une place en terrasse, ce qui est très agréable
La pislner au café est vraiment délicieuse, elle est étonnamment claire, mais pour les amateurs de café c'est un must try!
La bière au petit fruit dont la couleur ressemble à un bleuet (dernière de la liste) est pas mal aussi ms un peu acide
La stout est bonne aussi
Nous avons aussi testé les accras d'aiglefin et ils sont délicieux!
Bref, une bonne adresse à tester!"}
{"text":"Great pub with friendly service and an awesome rooftop patio. Reservoir is english-friendly and a good spot to get some novel, healthy eats with  notable vegetarian tacos. Beer selection is excellent with a few nitro brews on hand. Strangely enough they do offer bombers, though you're not allowed to take them out of the pub. Shame, I guess you'll have to drink them immediately. Which is no problem whatsoever given that their bottled beers are often experimental or unique. Good pricing and ambiance."}
{"text":"Here's my story for this place.

First off, let me preface by saying that I'm a sucker for excellent customer service; I usually notice every tiny detail of a business transaction/experience and subsequently dissect every layer of it, Larry David style.

I came here unexpectedly one night after having been kicked in the face by a stage diver at a concert.  I wanted a drink.  I got a pint of weizen beer and my partner in crime got a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was delicious and so was the beer.  While I was chatting with my partner in crime, the bartender came up to us and asked us if we were interested in another.  I said, \"I'd like another, but only after I finish the rest of this one.\" (My glass was still about a quarter full)

A little while later, something magical happened.  The moment I finished my drink, the bartender brought both me and my partner in crime fresh new drinks.  We hadn't even seen him prepare them.  Then I realized that he had waited for me to finish that last drop so that he could bring them out.  As he handed them to us he said, \"The timing seemed about right.\"  A tear gathered at the corner of my eye but I didn't dare betray my true feelings.  \"The timing was perfect,\" I replied.

Anyway, while it might not seem like a big thing, this bartender was just great.  Very laid-back, clever, and an awesome bartender overall.  I can definitely appreciate that, and it's what first sold me on Reservoir.

The layout is quite nice as well, and the bathroom is more than suitable for cleaning one's face after having been kicked by a stage diver.  It was just what I needed at the time, and I'm sure it will be what I need again."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, but a few months ago they totally changed the menu. It used to feature a lot of inventive small plates, but now it's all really average bar food, done slightly upscale. No reason to go anymore, too bad."}
{"text":"Ambiance, setting, the people and drinks. Great selection of beer and other liquors to choose from. Don't hesitate to ask to taste the drink before you  order, the people there are super nice and very forthcoming when one asks for suggestions. The ground floor is usually busy but starts clearing up around 8 or 9 pm."}
{"text":"Great place with a cool atmosphere... part brewpub, part bar, part lounge... all in all, very cool!

Having read the Yelp reviews about the upstairs terrace, that was exactly where my sister and I headed when we stopped by around 8 pm on a Sunday night. I spotted a couple tables filled with people on the first floor (which has more of a bar/pub feel to it), before heading up to the second floor. The second floor has a lounge feel to it, with low tables and seating in the dimly lit room. It's open air on two sides to the terrace, which had about 10 tables, one free when we arrived. We snagged the free table (on the side, not overlooking the street, although it was a quiet street, so I don't know how much of a view there would have been).

Our server came out right away and took our drink order. He was very friendly. When we arrived, there were menus on the table with the drinks list and the appetizers. When the server came back, he told us that the full menu was written above the bar in the inside room (annoying). So we had to get up from our table, stand awkwardly in the empty second-floor lounge area, and try to read the menu as quickly as possible (of course, it was in French, and not all French food ingredients are things you learn in college French). So, having attempted to quickly figure out which dishes sounded best, we slunk back to our table to pretend like we'd never had to get up in the first place.

The end of all of that was that I ordered the Greek-style tacos from the dinner menu and my sister ordered the croque-monsieur from the appetizer menu.

Our food came quickly enough, and was good. Like pub food, but with a French flair (and in my case, a Mexican/Greek/French flair?). The tacos were basically build your own style, with a chick pea filling, cucumber/tomato/vinagrette topping, and tzatziki sauce. Really interesting, and very good! My sister's croque-monsieur was good, with apple butter as an interesting twist.

My beer was great - I went for the black beer for my first round and the pilsner for my second. The servers switched shifts, and a girl took over our table. She was friendly and attentive.

We lingered on, staying until around midnight. Most of the diners on the terrace were there for the long run - casual conversations with friends, prolonged meals, several rounds of drinks. The terrace had a fantastic atmosphere on a warm summer night in Montreal. Being so far north, the sun stayed out for a long time and took forever to fully set. I'm sure this place is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, but for us, late on a summer Sunday, it was the perfect place to sit back, relax, and chat."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for beer in the plateau. They always have a few good brews on tap and the terrace upstairs is amazing. They also feature a few tasty and inexpensive light eats and sandwiches / burgers.  I really like their grilled cheese and the Halumi sandwiches. On my last visit I had an American Pilsner that is just right for summer. Their American IPA is nice and hoppy! Service is the non-pushy kind (AKA you will be left alone after being served), and it's just better to go pay at the counter."}
{"text":"Good beers.  Great for brunch.  Lovely atmosphere in the summer.  Sometimes smells of the night before.  Somewhat slow table service even when the entire place is empty."}
{"text":"Friendly, cozy Montreal at its best. We were in town for a few days from California, came in here looking for dessert, and were bummed to find out the kitchen was closed with not a brownie crumb to be found. But Simon at the bar was so sweet and so cool that just chatting with him for a few minutes over our delicious beers made it all worth the visit. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Was surprised to find a few tables open at 6:00 on Saturday. The outdoor balcony/terrasse at the 2nd floor is obviously the place to be but large windows opening up to said patio (upstairs) and the street (downstairs) made it comfortable inside. 

Beer: Berliner Wiesse: Sour and refreshing. Blanche: So quaffable, i barely had time to get to know it. IPA: Hops in check and dripping with caramel, a nice surprise. Bottles: really interesting looking but I'm just not up for dropping almost $20 when the drafts are so well priced.

Food: According to other reviews this place is known for brunch but for the evening I would definitely call Reservoir a bar with food rather than a gastropub or even a brewpub Sandwiches (especially the pork) and bar snacks are good but portions quite small, so really more for pacing yourself than actual meal-taking.

Service: Friendly and relaxed. \"Relaxed\" is a euphemism for \"seemed to loose interest after our initial round,\" but it was early in the night and they were probably saving their energy. But the \"friendly\" part made this strangely not annoying. I didn't feel they were snubbing us and we got everything we asked for though it did mean having to walk a few steps to the bar a couple times. So, yeah, it was just one of those things that set the tone, but strangely not in a bad way.

I love the fact that a place called \"reservoir\" has hit upon the brilliant strategy of serving lukewarm tap water when you ask for hydration. It's cheekily brilliant -- after all why would you want to give your patrons ice-cold, thirst-quenching water for free when you could sell them an  ice-cold, thirst-quenching pint?

Also, for you other tourists, Duluth is a great street to walk down with lots of restos."}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a meat-free place, and Reservoir has inventive and thoughtful veg options that don't make you miss the meat and are tasty to boot. Their house beer though, I was less impressed with (I've better house-made beers in Montreal), so I wouldn't come here just for that."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets when you think about a gastro-pub.  I am a jaded New Yorker, and this place put me at ease!

The micro-brewed beers were amazing, but the food was the real star!  We ordered the cheese and charcuterrie plates, and loved every minute of it!

Sit on the terrace on the 2nd floor if you can!  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and great selection of beers and cocktails. They offer 3-4 cocktails on their menu, but they can make whatever you would like them to make. The staff were very friendly and the prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"C'était clairement NOTRE bar, celui où on allait quand on ne voulait pas se faire à manger, qu'on ne savait pas quoi manger, qu'on voulait être surpris, et qu'on avait envie d'une bonne bière

Les bonnes bières sont toujours là, elles...
Des plateaux de charcuterie maison et des brunchs de gravlax de saumon, on est passé aux burgers avec de la pseudo viande et aux salades de kale et feta. 
D'une carte qui changeait à chaque semaine, on est passé à une même carte de 10 plats identiques depuis 6 mois.
Et mon amie qui est vegan a eu du mal à trouver de quoi manger dans ce resto végé

Vraiment, vivement l'été qu'on puisse se satisfaire seulement avec les bières"}
{"text":"The beer is great here but I absolutely love the  meat-free menu. It's about time!

Update: they gave up on the meat-free menu. I've given up on them. Le Réservoir is dead to me."}
{"text":"A great little micro-brew place with tasty snacks...I'm a a big fan of their white beers...especially in the summer on the rooftop terrace.

Reservoir also has a great brunch on the weekend, it's definitely not cheap but worth it."}
{"text":"Friends and I came for some after dinner drinks on a Saturday night. I loved the laid-back atmosphere of the place and the kind attentiveness of our servers. Even though it is a microbrewery, we tried some of the cocktails on the menu and found those very tasty! As a snack, the churros were simply delicious. I was so happy it was near to where we were staying on our visit to the city. I'd definitely come back if I could and recommend it!"}
{"text":"What I knew: beer. Pilsner, ales, stouts. Brewed here. Cocktails.
What I assumed: upper scale bar snacks like olives and almonds.
What I guessed: dinner menu, on the chalkboard.
What surprised me: the second floor terrasse. 

Late night noshing meant that some of the main entrees were fini. But the fish and chips were calling my hangry tummy. Arriving 10 or so minutes later, presented on a wooden board with a spread of tarter sauce, mayo and ketchup -- I shut up and stuffed my face full. 

A lively feel upstairs, we were surrounded by folks doing Irish Car Bombs (although, this is not that kind of place), mixed with giggles and laughter brought on by a mixed crowd. Hipster aloof is what I was expecting from the service, but what we found was friendly guys who were on the ball and whipping up some pretty stellar drinks. 

Would I go back for beers and brunch? Uh, is my name Crystal H?"}
{"text":"Pretty chill place with helpful staff and a good number of beer options. It's pretty cool they have their own brewed beer. My friends and I all go different ones Sour, Sweet and the last one on the menu (sorry forgot the name) tasted a bit salty, kind of reminded me of fish. My friends didn't like it, but I thought it tasted cool."}
{"text":"Disappointed... 

That's what comes to mind. The service was slow, like... we don't care if you're in the place slow. They forgot out order twice. The first 3 things we ordered off the blackboard were out of stock. Which led to the dreaded line \"so what DO you have?

The food that did arrive was ok. Chalk this one up as the \"trendy joint that won't last forever\". Not at Plateau standards. It survives on location and terrace."}
{"text":"So good and So close really too close but really too good if that makes sense. We were waiting to check into our apt and found this place via yelp/a friend of a friends recommendation. We were  the only people here around 2:30 pm and they only offer the snack menu until HH so we ordered grilled cheese , the house chips and LOTs and LOTS of wine. I was in heaven for the short time i consumed this sandwich and  would for sure order it again. As we entered our second hour here more people came and pretty soon if was mobbed. This seems to be a very local place and the price point for food,wine and beer was spot on. We did see the daily menu board and were intrigued (not enough to come back but intrigued) Service was friendly enough and the people watching was legit."}
{"text":"Pour un brunch, un dimanche matin...
Très bon accueil où l'on se soucis des clients.
Ambiance détendues, musique pas trop forte, les tables proches de la devanture, font profiter de la rue et du soleil.
De belles assiettes et de belles portions.
J'ai pris un panini bacon, très bon, mais deux petits bémol, les grains de sel rajoutés sur la salade sont un petit peu de trop (quand je l'ai signalé au serveur, il m'a proposé de la changer) et les patates rattes, telles qu'annoncées n'en étaient pas...
Bref, deux jus d'orange-pamplemousse, pressés du matin (9$), deux café (5.50$), un panini extra bacon (17.50$), avec sa salade, ses patates et son ketchup et un mi-cuit thon, avec crêpes, uf mollet, salade (16.5$), le tout apparemment fait de produits frais et de qualité.
J'y retournerai, c'est certain..."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Perfect for vegetarian food and brilliant beer! Enjoyed the place thoroughly. Had taco and IPA Citra.... My first night in Montreal fully worth it!"}
{"text":"we went out with a group of 8ish on a friday evening and i expected a crowded spot full of rowdy 18 year olds (oh canada and your interesting drinking age!). however, reservoir was nothing like what i expected! we sat upstairs (there's also a cute outside balcony area), had no problems finding seating, and i liked that there was no pressure to order. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and forrest y really enjoyed their in-house brew. a few tempting munchies (grilled cheese sandwich - yumm!) and decent prices. wish that the bathrooms were cleaner and the music was weird (irregular electronic beats) but a good place for 20-30-somethings to enjoy a drink, catch up with friends, and relax."}
{"text":"if you like beer, steer clear, 4.9% and 35ibu does not and IPA make.  I shouldn't be able to read the menu through the beer, that's not to say I expect unfiltered just some substance.  reasonably priced I suppose, probably because they don't use any grain.  keep walking past and drink anywhere else."}
{"text":"Stumble upon this place on a solid night venturing around Montreal. Take the upstairs patio!!! You can see the stars at night while sipping on good beer and enjoy the summer breeze. Very warm and lively ambiance. 

Servers were still figuring out some kinks,as  they kept delivering food to our table even though we didn't order it. Service  was also slower then usual as we had to order drinks at the bar ourselves. We also tried fiddlehead ferns - has a long bean look but taste like asparagus. The breadcrumbs and the grated Parmesan was a tasteful combination. The dressing was very vinegrettey. I think it wouldve been better if they were less generous with it or drizzled it on the side instead (personal preference).

Great place for a group to chill/catch up with!"}
{"text":"Cool place, great Beer, unfortunately very impersonal service to the point where it's uncomfortable. Damn you can't even have a chat about their home brewed beer. Not the warmth and cheer that I'd expect from a neighbourhood bar :/
Went for a couple, stayed for one."}
{"text":"Walking through the downtown core and into the Plateau on Sunday, we were half-convinced some world-important event had occured that kept everyone chained to the TVs inside their houses. We were wrong, and the crowd in The Resevoir at noon when we arrived proved it. However, a table for two was not hard to come by and we waited a mere ten minutes - giving us plenty of time to debate our menu choices displayed on a big board behind the bar.

It was a difficult decision. Health concerns pushed me towards a fruit salad that sounded scrumptious (nuts and prunes... how tasty!), yet, i gave in to a carb craving and ordered crepes with a pear compote, yogurt and maple syrup. Rather unfortunately, ten minutes after ordering, our waitress returned to ask me if pineapple compote would be okay because they had just run out of pear... le sigh. I love pineapple, but i am not a big citrus marmalade gal. My plate arrived: Three medium sized pancakes overlapping with a layer of jam and yogurt in between each and ample yogurt elsewhere on the plate. Carb heaven...

Luckily, my companion did not give in to a carb temptation. He ordered duck - with bread and fried pancetta. I stole a bite and although i believe i like my duck a little more done, it was still very very tasty. An unfortunate oversight - no steak knives with the duck. However, the beverages - fresh orange-grapefruit juice and my earl grey tea which they steamed my milk for - were a pleasant addition. Did i mention the plentiful freshly-baked bread with butter (that should have been salted, but that's a true preference thing)?

Resevoir needed to be visited. The ambiance is superb and the food worth the money (from $5 to $17 - my crepes were $10 and more than filling enough). It has not supplanted 7A as my favourite breakfast place, but it does have my recommendation."}
{"text":"The beers at this place are solid. Better than your typical microbrew/brasserie. We tried the Cream Ale, the Citra Pale and the Berlinner Weisse with sour cherries. All of them were good. I'm not crazy about the cream ale, but our waiter/bartender did warn us it was a pretty mild flavored beer, so I can't blame em there. 

We also got the tacos and the churros and WOW. I don't think I've had tacos that good on the east coast before. Very surprised at how good they were. The churros were decadent too. Covered in sugar, moist yet crunchy and still hot from the fryer, really solid caramel (homeade?) sauce and whipped cream. Not cheap but so, so good. 

Overall this is a solid solid place and I highly recommend stopping in"}
{"text":"This one is gold. Every beer I tried was delicious. It's not much more expensive, if at all, than a lot of the nearby dives on St Laurent, and you get great quality for your money. Great atmosphere, quiet, dim."}
{"text":"Awesome IPA, great music, and delicious fish and chips. Olives and grilled cheese were great too, though some of the olives were a bit past their prime. Staff is friendly and attentive. You can buy certain bottles to enjoy at home. 

I really like the vibe of this joint. It's the type of place that just screams \"sit here for a few hours and enjoy your beer.\" One of my favorite stops in Montreal."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour un brunch et ça ne m'a plus pour autant. Le service a été particulièrement lent et désorganisé. Malgré une ambiance bien léché l'endroit était bruyant et désorganisée."}
{"text":"Very fun and chill atmosphere, not too loud or crowded on a Tuesday night (of course). Unfortunately it had been raining a lot and there was no terrace setup, but I would like to go back and check it out next time. The bartender was a tad snobby (he only spoke French and when I tried to speak slowly in English my local friend just ended up telling him in French what I was saying), but that wasn't a big deal. He seemed skeptical that I would like the apparently strong IPA I had ordered, but I like IPAs and it's not his business really! :]

Aside from that, I had a great time sitting at the bar and chatting with a friend. I'd go back if I'm in Montreal again someday."}
{"text":"Pub sympa où la bouffe est pas mal et les bières bonnes.
Cependant pensez à changer sur internet vos menus car quand tu prend la carte du restaurant et que tous les prix ont augmenté de 1.5 voir 2$ je trouve ca moyen ..."}
{"text":"Halfway through our 3.2 km walk to Dieu du Ciel, we were obviously in need of refreshment. Luckily, we spotted the roof patio at Reservoir, and the decision was made. 

We tried two beers, the IPA Citra and the Blanche, both were phenomenal. After watching the waitress carry them past, we also decided to give the petits beignets a go, and they were crispy and delicious, just like we'd hoped.

The service was friendly and comfortable, just like the atmosphere. Love the rooftop patio (though there aren't a ton of seats that are actually outside). I bet they wait all winter to throw those glass doors open."}
{"text":"A lot of people have already written about this place's music, brunch, and bar. Though I don't think anyone has mentioned that you have the option to get coffee drinks served \"in a bowl.\" They essentially bring out an oversized cereal bowl full of your desired beverage! 

Great for those who like to work to down-tempo techno and sip the afternoon away."}
{"text":"This place was totally delicious and recommended to me by the owner of another fabulous restaurant!! Honestly, it was difficult to stop eating the entire time I was visiting Montreal.

This place is buzzing, but we still managed to find a table. The servers were really lovely, but definitely took some time to get our plates of deliciousness to us. Initially I was going to go for the crepes, but then I saw the biscuit topped with smoked salmon, a poached egg and avocado puree. Phenomenal. Even though the portion was large enough to defeat me, i managed to eat all of it. I couldn't imagine letting it go to waste. That would've been a crime against my tastebuds. I didn't realize that smoked salmon could taste that good.

The eggs benedict were also amazing. 

It was a leisurely and amazing brunch. I shall return."}
{"text":"Top shelf cream ale, fun vibes, roof top patio , great prices, uber cool hangout in the city!"}
{"text":"Réservoir est petite micro-brasserie très discrète de la rue Duluth au coin de Saint-Laurent. Il est fort possible que vous ne l'ayez jamais remarqué. Dommage pour vous. 

Cette micro-brasserie avec son look européen vous offre un choix classique des bières faites sur place. Son menu, à l'ardoise, vous propose des choix gastronomiques passant du tartare, au filet de poisson, aux croustilles maison.  

Je vous recommande le «grilled-cheese» et lard avec une la petite salade de roquette bio, copeaux de Padano en accompagnement. Le «grilled-cheese» composé de gruyère, de beurre de poires, d'oignons marinés et bien sûr du lard (un supplément): tout simplement sublime!!

L'ambiance y est vivante sur ses deux étages. Le deuxième est seulement ouvert lors des heures de pointe. Plafonds hauts, tables en bois, une belle terrasse au deuxième. C'est l'endroit parfait pour une belle soirée à discuter entre amis.

Un petit conseil, le Réservoir à une clientèle qui se relaye fréquemment. Les soirs plus achalandés, pour être certain d'avoir une place, arrivez avant 17h ou après 21h. 

Ah! J'oubliais, pour dessert le pot de crème au chocolat et fleur de sel vaut le détour. Merveilleux contraste entre le sucré et salé, le croquant de la fleur de sel. (Petit conseil: ne perdez pas trop de temps pour le manger la leur de sel fond ...)"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident on a cold winter night a few years ago, and it turned out to be quite nice. They have about six beers on tap at the same time. All are crafted on place, and vary from night to night. I personally enjoyed the Cherry Porter, and their IPA. 

I found their food to be average, especially for the price. Everything is vegetarian, but the choices are varied. Finally, our service was decent. The clientele, and overall atmosphere is pretty hipster, so keep that in mind if it's not something you like. 

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I would come here all the time if I lived here. Excellent IPA, great food, accommodating bartenders. Mixed olives were a great variety and very generous. I got the grilled cheese which was crispy with extra sharp cheddar, and caramelized onions. Tried my boyfriends fish and chips which was superb, and again, very generous. I would have gotten it if I thought I could handle it. Overall we both chose right and were glad we came to reservoir, which had been on our to-do list since day one."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. It was my favorite stop in Montreal! Music was chill, servers were chill, and the atmosphere too. Crowd was cool. I expected pretentious hipsters, but really everyone was just hip. Reviewers suggested going to the 2nd floor to sit, but realized there would be a difference in the winter. I just got back from our trip, March, but it was snowing a bit. So the upstairs ended up being just more seating space rather than an open terrace.. a bit lounge-like, but definitely much less pub-like and loud than downstairs. It closed earlier though, maybe 11pm-12am ish.  Our server was sweet, friendly, and very helpful. She offered to translate everything and was very attentive, her timing was perfect in bringing over our second round of drinks. 

My boyfriend and I both got the cream ale. I just checked the menu online and can't find it, but if you happen to see it when you're there, get it!!! So, so good. He can't stop talking about it. I'm less of a beer aficionado and I can't stop either! So CREAMY and rich and smooth. Definitely coming back, even just for that beer.

We ordered from the written menu, and our friends ordered from the specials on the board, some fish dish that I didn't try, but looked delicious. We got the grilled cheese, fish and chips, and arugula salad. Overall a great combo! The grilled cheese was quite small for the price, in my opinion, with 1.50 for extra bacon, which we got of course. But it was just too good to complain. Pickles were eh, though. Fish and chips were very yummy, nothing crazy to rave about there, but the arugula salad was especially nice. Extremely light yet flavorful. And definitely necessary with all the greasy stuff we were eating haha

Coming back without question."}
{"text":"I have ignored Reservoir for years. Not sure why, may be just have forgotten about its existance, because there are so many other brew pubs in town. A week ago I walked by and I saw the cherry white on the beer list, and I knew I must return soon. Oh, cherry beer, cherry beer! The cherry brew is rather red then white, has a mild sweetness and it is very easy to drink, although somehow dangerous with its 5.7% for somebody who just came back from business trip and is a little bit exhausted. The Reservoir list of brews is relatively small, but there is something for everybody. My date appreciated the Citra IPA. The food options are affordable and some of the simple choices are perfect match for the beers. The hummus with naan bread and the delicious french fries could be the favourite snack for everybody.  As every respectable brew pub in Montreal Le reservoir is relatively small, sweetly crowded and sometimes overwhelmingly noisy. The folks working there will make sure your pint in never empty and will bring you beers promptly. In the end the cherry beer is the reason of this five stars review and no doubt everybody must try it soon!"}
{"text":"Great list of self brewed beers and a food list to match, the atmosphere of this place is warm and inviting.  I really enjoyed the Cream ale on a warmer summer day (and I'm sure they have some great beers for winter).

Certainly a place that I'd like to bring friend's back to for a few drinks and a good time, there's a little bit for everyone here!"}
{"text":"Pour un brunch entres amis, très bon accueil, service extra.
Les plats y sont copieux et vraiment excellents. Choix variés, pour toutes les bourses."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a nice, comfortable place that wasn't pumping music, and wasn't full of pretentious hipsters. This was a great find. Very cool place with its own micro brew, but not all the attitude of a lot of places we strolled by on Rue Saint-Denis, or Boul St-Laurent. I wished I was a local here as it was just welcoming, comfortable, and cool without trying too hard."}
{"text":"Fun pub with a terrasse on the roof. Their beer selection is good if sparse. They mostly make classics (IPA, cream ale, pilsner, stout...) with a few wildcards here and there (Black cherry Berliner Weisse).

They only make vegetarian food and they know what they're doing! 

I'm one of those buzzkills who'll trash-talk anything vegetarian that's trying to imitate meat, but the veggie burger is amazeballs and almost doesn't make you wish for real meat!

The tacos and vegetarian chili are also really good.

The staff is cool and friendly.

Definitely one to check out."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive brews, tasty snacks, friendly and hip service. A great place for beers with friends in the Lower Plateau. The grapefruit IPA and the Weiss were well balanced and fresh. The Whitney Houston playlist for the extent of our visit didn't hurt either. Don't let the pretentious look fool you. Also great for brunch!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning brunch recommended by our bartender the previous night, and boy did it hit the spot. Good espresso and fantastic food. I agree with others, the service wasn't amazing, but considering it was packed, and considering the quality of the food, I still give it 5 stars. The menu changes often, and theres a nice variety. Unbelievable short ribs were the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a drink. We already had dinner so we walked by this place and checked out the upstairs area and while the patio was full around 7/7:30pm, we found a few seats in the middle and ordered some drinks. Pints are $6 and if you like light beers, I'd recommend the Blanche. Overall, seems like a popular place for some vegetarian eats and decently priced drinks!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there yesterday. I had read about their beer and that is why we went there. Let me tell you, those people were not wrong. They have awesome and one of a kind beer. My friends and I loved them. We tried 3 different kinds and shared them. Loved them all, the service is good and the vibe of the bar is good. The location is convenient and well overall: loved it!"}
{"text":"A small hidden bar on the street Duluth. Nothing showy or pretentious. Just the way I like it. A casual place to have drinks and some good bar food with very good vibes. The service is excellent, very attentive and super fast. There patio is lovely to sit with great friends and talk about anything.  The cocktails are not many but each one of them is a good selection and unique style.  Must try."}
{"text":"This place has excellent house brewed beers. I've only ever tried the cream ale, because it's so good, so I can't report on all of the varieties they have on tap. The first time I tried it, it almost tasted like cream soda. I commented to the waitress how creamy it was and she said the batch was creamier than usual. Upon tasting a second batch of the same brew, I realized that she was right. Still, the cream ale is pretty good! I'd give this place another star if their food items were a little less pricey."}
{"text":"Reservoir is the kind of place where, whether you're going for a meal or just want to enjoy a drink with friends, you can be surrounded by people, yet still have an intimate conversation. The food and drink options are fantastic, but more than anything, the atmosphere is what makes it. 

Right at the corner of Duluth and St Laurent, it's a breath of fresh air in a crowded part of the city."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to hang with a cool crowd and a good pint of brew? Look no further. Stopped here for a cold one on a Thursday night. The bartender was helpful and made good recommendations. We sipped our beers and soaked in the atmosphere. The crowd here is laid back and trendy. All in all, a great find!"}
{"text":"Great bar.  Some of the portions are too small, but the tartare is always a good size and delicious when they haven't run out.  Nice upstairs patio."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was because I came here on Friday in the middle of the afternoon, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was so-so.  My beer was decent but not that great.  The downstairs is a bit tiny for my liking.  The upstairs roof patio is nice, but smoke free.

Still, everyone else here seems to like it, so I'm sure my review is a bit skewed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to meet up with friends, this is a great spot. If you love beer, then you will love it. They have a great selection of beers and a pretty good choice for a poutine. The place can get pretty crowded on the weekends, so I would recommend to get there early. Their banana flavor beer is delicious!"}
{"text":"J'ai été brunché la bas : jus pressé dilué dans l'eau et toutes petites portions pour un prix relativement élevé . Nous étions 4 et avons tous eu la même impression. Heureusement les serveurs sont sympas."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Reservoir, it was so dark... On a Monday night, this place was quiet.

Bartender was nice and helpful in helping us to pick our beers but since Reservoir has a limited choices on draft: Black, White, Scotch Ale, Plisner, Weizen, Cherry and IPA.

We didn't order any snack or food because it was almost midnight... and all we need was a drink.

Beers were OK. I guess...

Nothing standout to be too awesome for a special trip, but definitely will drop by for a pint or 2 when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"We came here after a nice Yelp event for the after-event drinks. This is a cool pub, they have a very cool balcony upstairs BUT its not very huge so if you are more then 4-5 people its hard to find a spot (better for 2-3 people). I found the music levels a little too loud (again if you get the balcony its a different story) and the service a little slow (they were packed). The beers are very good, especially since its a micro brewery. I am a big fan of porters (which they dont have) but the triple was very good. Overall experience was great due to the company and the beer. I would consider revisiting this place if I can get the balcony sits"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on the list of hottest brunch for Aug and went with one friend - we both loved this place! She ordered the plate of two eggs and I ordered the one with shrimp. Both delicious and portion is good!"}
{"text":"It's a fancy breakfast place without the pretentious overtone that I have been noticing in the plateau. 

The menu was simple and clean. I had a light fresh salad, all the vegetables were fresh and with a light dressing with a light pinch of basil.Great place to have a brunch, try the fresh grapefruit juice, it's so refreshing, no added sugar.
Food is fresh and organic,
Definitely a worth wild place to come again"}
{"text":"The beer was great. As was the pot de creme and the fish and chips and the giant salad of arugula. Not over dressed, but very simple. Staff was very helpful in describing all the beer they have and what they taste like."}
{"text":"Mon frère m'a amené ici pour le brunch un dimanche matin et je dois dire que j'ai été super impressionné. L'ambiance est très cool, décontractée et assez bruyante. La majorité des plats offerts étaient des classiques avec une touche d'originalité. 

J'ai pris un plat de tortilla croustillant avec des haricots noirs, une tranche de bacon fumée maison recouvert d'un oeuf frit. Super! J'ai aussi essayé une de leurs bières (nous étions dans une brasserie apres tout)!  Mon frère a semblé apprécier son gravlax de saumon au kimchi, oeuf poché, purée d'avocat au yuzu kosho, muffin anglais maison.

Cependant je dois dire que le service était un peu lent. Ne vous attendez pas à des portions énormes comme certains restaurants pour petit-dejeuner. J'y retourne en courant!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends after dinner to grab some drinks. It's a nice place with a good ambience. We sat upstairs and were hoping to find a place out on the terrace but it was all full. I had a pint of their blanche which was nice and light. They charge about $6-$6.50 for a pint which is pretty reasonable and the servers were all pretty friendly too. Seems like a pretty nice place to hang out. Will definitely love to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for hand crafted, made on premises beer as well as the best vegetarian food I have had anywhere. I wasn't expecting vegetarian but the bartender mentioned it and I was like what the heck. The menu is so diverse and full of choices that I forgot it was vegetarian. 
I had a duo of soft tacos that contained a variety of ingredients that made me feel like I was at a Mexican taco stand. Paired with the West Coast IPA I found myself in food heaven. 
The atmosphere here is great too. Dark and mysterious with a great selection of music playing. Make sure you check out the giant beer tanks too. I love this place and would definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Cool little local bar.  Good beer brewed on location.  Laid back atmosphere.  Going back again."}
