{"text":"Never again.

Disrespectful staff, delivery is generally late.
Pizza is soggy and hoagies taste like cabbage instead of lettuce (also soggy).
The staff was very rude and disrespectful when I called because my order was late."}
{"text":"Usually order from this location. Always dependable product and good quality. Manager is personable and accommodating. This is one of our go to's. Thanks guys for being awesome!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but the prices are really high for the amount of food you get. I got a $15 pizza that I finished myself and my wife's salad had very little lettuce on it."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I can honestly say i have never had a bad experience with them. They are very friendly on the phone. Always gets here on a timely matter. We have had most likely everything on the menu. Definitely recommend you to try them out if you're looking for a good and new pizza place to try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. The crust was darn near perfect. The toppings fresh. And reasonably priced. We will keep this place in mind for future pizza cravings."}
{"text":"I just had a white pizza with added spinach. It was delicious! I love the thicker crust that was crunchy and chewy at the same time.
I also got a greek salad, and you can tell the dressing was homemade cause it was perfect."}
{"text":"I'd like to give them a better review because their pizza is very good and the price is great, but the people who are work here are some of the rudest people ever.  They pretty much act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  I once called them about a half hour before they close to place an order and they expressed disappointment because they were closing soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out The pizza company since it opened a few months ago. Stopped in for lunch twice in the last two weeks.  Great lunch special for two slices and a drink for $5.99.  Good food at decent prices. Everything is homemade including their sauce.  I had a slice of white pizza and pepperoni also ordered provolone sticks. Nice and hot on a cold winter day.   Very friendly staff and a family family-owned business. I will support them when I am in the area.  Added bonus is the free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"The Pizza Company is our usual pizza place.  Their crust is chewy and tastes amazing...I absolutely love the breadsticks.  The sauce is great and they have the best pepperoni; it's crispy on the edges and it curls up into little bowls on top of the pizza.  Deliveries have always been on time.  

I can't give five stars, however, because of the inconsistency in the cooking.  When the pizza, breadsticks and cheesesticks are fully cooked, they're amazing...but there have been several times that the food wasn't left in the oven/grease long enough, maybe because they were in a rush, and it's disappointing when you're expecting \"amazing\" but only receive \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Well I can only give them a 1 star because I can't taste their delivery. I would like to order but they refuse to deliver to \"Mt. Oliver \" .... I guess anything after nobles is off bounds.... They do deliver all over Baldwin ! Which extends from the Mon river all the way out too South Park!!! Yea but keep it local !!!! Or you are just judging !!! I'm going with judging !!!!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza for a Friday or Saturday night watching a ball game or a movie. Owner super nice family run business, so also support them when i can."}
{"text":"Had a  great  hoagie  from  here  last  night. Toppings  were  exactly  as ordered and  the  mozzarella  sticks  were  very  good  also. Delivered  in less time  than  I  thought. Good  experience ."}
{"text":"I got pizza here on a Saturday night in a pinch.  Looking for a place that sells by the slice, I drove around for a while.  Not only did they have by-the-slice pizza, but they also had some of my favorite toppings.  I also hate crust that's too thick, and -- although I prefer it even thinner than it was -- I was pretty satisfied with the crust.  

The only thing that could be improved is the salad.  We got a grilled chicken salad.  The chicken and fries were okay, but the rest was pretty run of the mill.

As for the pizza, I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. The slices are a little small but the crust is good...not too thick not to thin. Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"The Pizza Company came through!
We don't often treat ourselves to any greasy-goodness and often try to stick to the healthy lire fair but when we do step out from under that veil, we want something really good. Showed up nice and hot in just under 40 minutes and the delivery guy was nice and friendly. We would certainly recommend the Pizza Company and will probably be returning customers when we feel like treating ourselves again... Always so good!"}
{"text":"It's pizza, and my family prefers Pizza Company over the big chains, and other local places. We used to order from the Potomac location, since they delivered to our address, but since they've closed, the Library Rd. store is our go to shop. 
The wings, and breadsticks have been given a thumbs up by the kids. Pizza has been consistent, whether we're ordering a cheese pizza, or something with extra toppings like pepperoni, or Italian sausage. Service is friendly, food is good, the only drawback is having to drive Rt. 88."}
{"text":"Good specials for pizza by the slice. You usually have to use several napkins to soak up the grease but it's decent pie and close to Children's Hospital. Hoagies are decent"}
{"text":"Remember that saying, that sex is like pizza - even when it's so-so, it's good? That pretty much sums it up. There's nothing appallingly wrong with the Pizza Co. pizza. It's just kind of ho-hum. 

With that said, I enjoyed the chili poppers a lot. (Which were inexplicably wrapped with the ranch sauce for delivery. Mmmmm....hot, sweaty ranch dressing.)

The delivery guy was really friendly. Delivery time was unimpressive. A full 45 minutes mid-afternoon, and I live two blocks away? That's what I get for being lazy, probably. Karmic pizza. 

Prices are pretty good though, so that's a bonus. They may end up being my 'Dangit, I've only got fifteen bucks!' joint. Otherwise, probably not."}
{"text":"Quick and to the point.... Ordered  a steak and cheese later in the evening. Very little steak or cheese... Mainly delicious bread. Seriously... Mancinis bread is awesome! The steak was dry but it was like 930 and they close at 1000 so..... About $10 for the meal. Bloomfield is overflowing with pizza shops. there are better."}
{"text":"I got a medium pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and 6 hot wings. By the time they were delivered they were both luke warm. In my opinion i wasted $2.50 asking for extra cheese. There is less cheese on my pizza than your average pizza. The bottom of my pizza was half burnt and there was barely any red sauce. My hot wings were little, soggy, and I seemed like they squirted the hot sauce on the inside of the container then threw the wings on top. I am very disappointed and I regret paying $20 for them."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, the Pizza is amazing! I'd suggest their hoagies as well!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is okay. But the service here is second to none. Always quick to pick up the phone and are super fast to have your order ready even in the weekend when there are so busy fastest take out I've ever had!!! Fact  
But it is the Philly Cheese steak hoagies that I keep coming back here for they are Amazing taste yummy !!! 
I  love them because they give you a lot of steak not like other places where you get no steak and have to buy extra meat. Plus The Chuckle Brothers my two wee laddies who are aged 6 and 2  just love the cheese steak too which is nice. Because they only eat the good stuff. So come on folks you got to be good to yourself. Just pick up the phone and get yourself a Philly cheese steak cause I know I will. Ace job guys I'll be coming back for more.
Cheers keep up the great job"}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza around. Consistency.  Seems like they run a tight ship there.  Fries are fresh cut and remind me of Potato Patch."}
{"text":"When I go to other pizza places I ask myself \"will this be as good as Pizza Companies pizza\"?.  

I don't understand how this place hasn't gotten Papa Johns big cause rarely do I get a pizza or a sandwich that's inconsistent with the last one I got.  The Steak Untouchables though not Primantis, is the close runner up for my favorite \"sandwich with everything on it\".  The hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce.  I hate when you go somewhere and it's just regular ripped off the head lettuce, not this place.  I do think it's a little expensive but I've watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I'm sure it's justified.  

Side tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it's a little different than their whole pizzas you order.  It's really good.

Oh yeah, be sure to ask for Longfellow Bones, he's a cook there and a hell of a rapper.  Tell him HITTofMCM sent you."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years. The pizza, hoagies, fries and especially the salads are fantastic. They have the BEST italian dressing I've ever had! The staff is always friendly. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"New location in Rostraver! Great wings! Take out wings are usually soggy or
Over cooked...not these! Cajun and buffalo are Amazing!"}
{"text":"I got a cheese pizza delivery from here once, and I feel like...it's one of those places where it's okay and if that's what someone put in front of me I would eat it, but I definitely wouldn't go, \"OMG, let's eat there!\"

It was just boring to me. (And I love cheese pizza!)

But some of my coworkers like to eat here on occasion, so maybe some of their other stuff is better. I wouldn't know."}
{"text":"I wanted a pizza just for myself and didn't want something too big, so I was glad to
see this pizza place had small size pizzas. They also had a white pizza option which looked interesting. 

I placed an order over the phone and was told it would be 20 minutes. I came a little earlier than the 20 minutes and the pizza was ready. The price was good, $7.99. 

I really liked the pizza. They crust was very light and flaky, almost like a pastry, and the white pizza had a nice garlic flavor without too much cheese. There were also some sliced tomatoes on it. It was just enough for one person. 

This is a strictly take out and delivery place. The workers were real friendly. Their menu is good, with a selection of different pizzas, sandwiches and side orders. It's a good place to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I live really close by and the menu is really promising. Unfortunately, I have had a few bad experiences here. First and foremost, the food is pretty sloppy. I ordered a pizza from here once (mushroom and onion) that was honestly promising, but the toppings were slapped on unevenly, and the whole pizza was overloaded with stuff, making it super heavy and soggy. If the pizza was properly balanced it would have been good. I liked the sauce a lot. 

The most recent time I ordered my boyfriend got a sandwich and I just got some fries. The french fries also get an F in my book. I don't think it's possible to have fries any soggier than this without them being classified as mashed potatoes. Too bad, because they use the thick-cut skin-on fries that I love.  We ordered cheese fries with the cheese on the side, but that didn't save this sloppy mess from being a complete disaster. They were inedible (gave them to my dog, but saved the coveted and delicious neon orange cheese sauce for later). My boyfriend got a sandwich that claimed to have \"spicy\" cole slaw, but it really was just regular vinegar cole slaw and was pretty sweet-tasting--not spicy at all. Other than that the sandwich was ok.  

The other thing that really rubs me the wrong way about this place is that the online prices are wrong. They have been wrong for at least 2 months, and no one seems to care. The manager got pretty short with me when I mentioned this to him.  I can see that this is a franchise place with a few locations, and I can't say if the price is right for any of them, or if they are all suffering from one incompetent website manager, but either way its an annoyance because I never know what anything costs. 

To be perfectly honest, I will probably try this place again and hope against hope that it isn't terrible again. All the pieces are there for a great classic take-out place, the execution is just off. Here's to hoping they get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Very nice price for pizza for one. The small is a decent price $5.99 for cheese and has six slices. The pizza doesn't have the benefits of tasting especially fresh or non commercial (things I seek out in a go to pizza spot) but it was definitely good pizza. I got it for delivery which arrived earlier than expected, did not include a delivery fee (once I hit $10 minimum) and the driver was especially present. While, in my opinion,  there are tastier Lawrenceville pizza options if you are in the neighborhood, this one is worth keeping in the phone for a tasty slice, solid delivery options and a pretty good price."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. They also have good sandwiches. Delivery is always on time, if not early. It's one of the better pizzas I've had since moving to the area and hits the spot. I like NY style pizza, and this is pretty close. Service is always good too."}
{"text":"Tried the white \"Gourmet\" pizza. Pretty good! Driver was chatty and.nice. A bit pricey, but seem high quality. Wish they had whole-wheat crust as an option, like my current favorite Pizza Care. :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Pizza was done to perfection on crispiness and freshness. Also had great service"}
{"text":"The restaurant is now a Fox's Pizza. A lot more menu choices and dessert options. Delivery available and close to children's hospital. Lot's of seating."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout (delivered by DoorDash) - 8 slice Spicy Pepperoni Pizza and Philly Steak and Cheese.

The food was awesome.

Pizza was cooked (NY Style) with the air pockets in the crust - my personal favorite and a sign that it is truly hand tossed (I believe) and not a crust already made or out of a box and formed.  It had the right ratio of Cheese and Sauce.   Topped with slightly thicker cut of pepperoni.

Philly Cheese Steak were commented on by another reviewer.    They are very good.   I am not sure where the get their buns, but they were very good.   A large amount of meat and cheese - again the ration was right.  I took the advantage to add mushrooms.

All and all - I will definitely put this in my rotation.  Great Stuff."}
{"text":"Honestly I love their hoagies.. Extremely juicy, lots of flavor, good amount of meat. Just a great hoagie. Their pizza is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The pizza is definitely good. The wings aren't crisp and they don't provide a dipping sauce for the wings."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here through Grubhub. Received notifications that it was being prepared. 2 hours passed and I called to check on the order and they told me they had called grubhub to say it was out of their delivery range. It's really poor customer service and pure laziness to not communicate that with me. Had I been called I could have gone to get it. I won't attempt to order from here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza, hoagies, wings and salads in the South Hills area. I drive all the way down 51 and pass up 5 other pizza places when I'm hungry for a good Italian hoagie. The guys working are super nice. This Pizza Company is the best location out of all of them."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, had it delivered to the hotel I was staying at. Delivery was timely and driver courteous. There were 3 of us and we all thought it tasted great, crust had some crunch to it which I like."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about the Untouchable since I don't like Primanti's sandwiches, but the pizza was more than decent. Unfortunately, they don't deliver to us, so we had to go there to get it."}
{"text":"Im sooooooo mad ...... I always eat here NO WHERE ELSE and this person answer phone trying charge me $14.99 for a large without any courtesy at all not asking what I would like on it or would there be anything else sir................
 CLICK! I was like Really?   Been going there for years and always telling others TRY them ... Oh Well! called back Spoke manager said was driver answer phone ... Now I am worried spit on my pizza.. OMG! Should of keep my mouth shut!"}
{"text":"Welp, they did it again. 2nd time I've ever ordered from here and they screwed it up again. 0/2 with this place. Ordered and paid for a large pizza and 3 dozen wings, and only got two dozen wings. That was the last time I order from this place. The food I did get was average at best."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! We usually stick with Primanti's pizza, but this is a good 2nd option. Hoagie wasn't great, but pizza is solid. Get garlic and pepperoni toppings. Sizes are small (xl looks like a typical large), but really this place is pretty good. Their wings aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I used to order from Pizza Company at least once a week a couple years ago but now it's very rare. Their prices continue to go up every time I order from them. I got a large pizza and and order of breadsticks for $20! Years ago I could order a pizza breadsticks and an ice cream and pay that much. Food is still good but it won't be an every week purchase for me. Maybe twice a year if that. I'd rather order expensive ass Chinese Food down the block. Oh and no prices shown on the online menu. Probably because the prices are always changing(continuously going up that is)."}
{"text":"Food is always tasty and service is fantastic. No matter how busy when we walked in we are greeted with a friendly face. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good, although for the price they could be a little more generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"The Cajun wings are my absolute favorite wings I've ever eaten.. The bread sticks are really good also!!"}
{"text":"Love the steak Untouchables! A friend turned me on to them and we were not disappointed. We just ordered another one! Delish!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I'm so happy this place exists and delivers! After my last pizza experience in my new neighborhood, I was soo wary ordering pizza ever again. But thankfully I gave it a try. We ordered a large pizza, half fresh mushrooms half just cheese. When I asked if their mushrooms are fresh or canned, they said they actually have both! How cool! I've never seen a pizza place offer both. Also they were happy to do my annoying request of half light sauce and half regular sauce, much appreciated. 

This crust is amazing, the whole thing is amazing really. I told my husband it's as good as Fiori's, which has been the only place we've ordered from in like 5 years when we lived in the south side. I'm so glad we found a new favorite in our new neighborhood. 

Ahhh Pizza Company take my moneyy, your pizza is amazing!
Thanks a bunch, from your newest regulars ^_^"}
{"text":"Typical pizza.  Good toppings, decent sauce and cheese but the crust is doughy and thick more like bread than a good fold in half NY style slice."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite pizza place in Pgh. Their crust isn't too soggy or overbaked. The toppings aren't too heavy or sparse. When I first ordered, they had both canned and fresh mushrooms and they called to ask if I had a preference which I thought was awesome. Will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh.  Why?  Pizza in Pittsburgh is usually thick crusts, piles of meat, and dark sauce. Fortunately, Pizza Company knows how to make real pizza--NY style. It's big, thin, just a little grease for flavor, and good pepperoni that cups. 2 slices and a drink for $6? It's just like any place you'll grab a slice in Manhattan. I'll take that every day."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place and their awesome pizza and attitude. I mean it. They are one of my favorite places to get pizza from in Lawrenceville. Their menu is spot on and their staff is just helpful and so very nice. I have never had any attitude from them and they are always willing to give an opinion or help you decide. I like that their delivery comes fast and there is something about the containers that their wings are in that keeps them fresh and crispy even during the delivery drive over. You know what I mean, right?! There are some places that when you get wings they get to your house and are all mushy and not good. I like a nice crispy wing and these containers allow them to vent in a way that the wing is not mush when I get it. Yum Yum. I like these wings. I like their Cajun rub, sweet and spicy, bbq, and the hot garlic. I have a real taste for wing sauce and these are the ones that I will stand up and proclaim, \"YES!\" 

Their pizza is also awesome too. I have tried a few different toppings and pizza and can say that most of them have been really spot on. There was a one they were trying out for a bit that was just eh, but I do not think it made the actual menu. 

I think that they make a great addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood pizza family.

I will say, if you are going to be ordering a few pizzas or dozen wings at a time, go to the store and get their menu coupons. If you just order a few pizzas without them you will really be missing out on a better deal. It will save you some money if you use the coupons. And saving money means more money for more pizza and wings the next time you want some."}
{"text":"Since they don't deliver as far as Beechview and offer no dine-in option, Kay and I picked up a small pizza and two \"Untouchable\" sandwiches this evening for dinner and are not disgruntled over doing so. 

The Pizza Company is a small-scale local chain that exists primarily in the South Hills of the city. This particular location has been here for so long I forget when it opened. Look for a humble structure of stone with the franchise's trademark: a diminutive green neon sign.

Their pizza, which we had with feta and black olives, possessed a crust that somewhat parallels toasted Italian bread  and features convex edges. The mozzarella had a bit of zing to it (a la string cheese) as did the red sauce. I wouldn't call it \"ho-hum\" at all. Pizza Co. makes a perfectly competent and edible pie. 

The \"Untouchable\" sandwich is one of multiple Primanti Brothers forgeries found throughout Western Pennsylvania, and as far as I can taste, it's a very good one. Instead of slices of Italian bread, the meats (steak, ham, salami, capicola, bacon, meatballs, and turkey are your choices, and I'm not kidding about the last three), provolone cheese, vinaigrette slaw, and french fries are placed inside of a velutinous yet stout hoagie roll. My sandwich included the steak, and I found it to be as succulent and savory as gyro meat. The fries were done steak-style and were as starchy as one would expect. The slaw could have kicked a little more ass, however, but no matter, this was what Ben Reilly was to Peter Parker; a worthy clone. 

The Pizza Company is welcome company, anytime."}
{"text":"Yeahhhh, I guess I'll go 3 stars too. 

When I saw the listing on Google, it was called Pizza Co. This led me to believe it was not the local chain, but as it turns out, it is in fact part of the franchise.

Looking at the website, I realized that they're mostly centered in the South Hills, my neck of the woods. I do see their ads from time to time but can't remember ever giving them a try until tonight. 

Onto the pizza. The crust had that tough bread-like quality, the kind that cracks on the outside and yields to your teeth on the inside. That in itself isn't a bad kind of pizza, but in this case was somewhat...blah. The cheese was really oily and sort of slithered off of the pizza. Again, blah. Not terrible, just...you get the idea. 

Verdict: Change the name to the So-So Pizza Co. 

The cost? They don't sell individual slices after 7pm at this locale( partially nipping the pizza crawl in the bud), so we got a small one (6 cuts) that ended up being just under 6 bucks. So the price is right here at Pizza Company. 

Note #1: No, we got no toppings and went cheese only. We were a little strapped. Expensive weekend. 

Note #2: The Pizza Company is known for a sandwich called \"The Untouchable\" which is yet another Primanti's imitation. 

Pizza King wins this match. Sorry guys. Indies will whup a chain more often than not. It's a foodie law."}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with the Greek pizza! Everyone is always extremely friendly when I call and place my order. I have ordered pizza a few times for family gatherings and everyone always enjoys the food. I am so happy we live within their delivery area."}
{"text":"**UPDATE January 2018**

The Pizza Company Lawrenceville is now FOX'S PIZZA DEN. I don't know why The Pizza Company left because it was the best in the surrounding neighborhoods. 

This is my review of Fox's Pizza Lawrenceville which I will add to their Yelp page once created:

Called to place my normal order and was NEVER told they changed hands (even when I asked why I wasn't in their system for delivery). I feel totally conned.

Pizza arrived around the 1 and 20 minute mark (called at the hour mark only to be left on hold). The pizza was TERRIBLE!!! No flavor whatsoever. Plus the pizza was COLD even though we live about three blocks from the establishment.

Sometimes when places change hands they keep some of the old. Sadly not in this case. Back to finding a decent pizza place in Pittsburgh...

**ORIGINAL REVIEW of PIZZA CO. LAWRENCEVILLE:

Great pizza!! We recently moved from NY and this is the closest we can find to a traditional NY thin crust pizza. Fabulous cheese makes for a very tasty pizza. Delivery is always on time and correct. Now our go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Boy do I love their pizza!  One of my favorites in Lawrenceville!  We've ordered from them 4 to 5 times since living in the area and we've never been disappointed.  Also really good re-heated!"}
{"text":"Omg the food here is BOMB  delivery time is always normal, not fast but not a super long time either. Highly recommend their wedgies & plain cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"I just have to update because on top of really great food, the service is absolutely fantastic as well. Super friendly and accommodating. It's just the way you expect to be treated at a local place and then some. We also order take away pretty often and we're like regulars I suppose. One of the employees, Alyssa (hope it's spelled correctly) knows we love Cherry Coke which hey sometimes run out of. When we order through Grubhub I'll add Coke to the order but she'll call and let us know they actually have cherry. How great is that?"}
{"text":"If you love pepperoni, get the Pepperoni feast 12- cut. You won't ask for a pepperoni again for weeks
Everyone in our group loved their slice.  My group consists of little people. 
Lost a star for wings that weren't outstanding. Garlic hot and regular mild tasted the same."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible pizza. cheese was under cooked, sauce was bitter, and canned mushrooms. oh yuck. The place was clean and cashier was helpful. But the quality of food is not good at all."}
