{"text":"The decor is pretty nice and the food is decent as well but slightly over priced for what's offered. It's a nice place to visit if you're craving sushi but not ayce around the area."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch. Only a few tables were occupied. Sat in a private booth which was nice. Gave us complimentary apperitif of noodles in a small cup of broth. Typical sushi and sashimi fare. Ordered various makis - spicy salmon, tuna, california rolls, salmon skin and various sashimi - salmon and tuna. Didn't try their nigiris. Total came to over $70 which I thought was pricey given what we ordered. Overall, ok quality of food. Not great, but not bad. Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant on Queen's Quay, close to the Harbourfront Centre.  

We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday of a long weekend, we were greeted warmly and quickly seated.   We were pleasantly surprised to find a small restaurant with private booths and tables which have a wooden privacy divider between adjacent tables.   Decor and ambiance were great.  The servers were friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive.  

We ordered a dinner for 2, which included; miso soup, salad, a small boat, tempura shrimp or lobster with assorted tempura veggies, grilled chicken or beef and green tea ice cream.  The food was fresh and arrived at the table quickly.  The presentation of the food was especially impressive.   

Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience and I would definitely return again.  If you are in the area, give Gonoe Sushi a chance, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I love this place - it's been far the best sushi I've tried in the area.  It's right on my way home from work so I stop in and treat myself to take-out every once in a while."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, but the qulity is recently getting worse. I have found cockroaches 2 times.
First, I found it dead under cantaloupe, fruit dish!!
Second, They run on the table and under my plate. Especially, If you order sashimi in a wooden boat, be careful!! 
It's terrifying that only one japanese restaurant in this neighborhood isn't clean anymore..."}
{"text":"This place is Toronto's hidden gem. The food is amazing and fresh, the staff are friendly and very attentive, the ambiance is great, and the service is quick.

It is not an All You Can Eat restaurant, but the quality is the best I've ever had. If you are looking for top quality sushi at a fair price then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this restaurant.  Cute Japanese decor with little private booths making a nice, relaxing dining experience.  The menu looks clean and fancy, with lots of pictures.  

Last time we were there, there was a little fly that circled our table throughout our meal.  It was annoying.

Appetizer sushi was not tasty and flavourful like west coast Pacific ocean fish (huge difference in taste), but fresh enough.  I would not order it again due to the bland taste.  The grilled salmon cheek was deliciously oily.  The BC tuna, however, was not fresh, and it was watery. 

My partner ordered some rolls, and we were a bit surprised at the price of a simple dynamite roll at $8.50.  The rolls were not very tasty.
The stone bowl was $15 and my partner enjoyed it, with lots of sauce.  
Not sure why, but we can get much better and much cheaper Japanese food in Vancouver.  

Everything considered, we will go back to try more of the cooked items and to enjoy the ambiance and pleasant service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem! Although it is a little pricy, the quality of the food is.phenomenal! The takoyaki was everything I remembered it to be in Japan, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. The Dragon roll is amazing, like everyone else says. The sushi pizza is a little lackluster, could have more toppings, but this place doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place right on Queens Quay. Ordered the Maki Set (dynamite rolls + spicy salmon). Rolls were tight and rice was just the right amount.  Comes with the typical miso soup and salad to start.  They also gave us a complimentary mini bowl of noodle soup which wasn't bad! We finished off our meals with dessert (an orange and melon slice). Would def come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Lovely japanese restaurant. Food was delicious!!!! We had the Bento, sushi, salmon teriyaki. Service was fast, very polite and efficiant. The price was good for such an excellent quality of ingredians and preparation. We will definitely be back on our nest visit to downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere is what you'd expect of a sushi place - wooden panelled windows, Japanese lantern decor and cute, almost-private booths.

I got the bulgogi bento box and my fianc√© got the chicken teriyaki. Both were fantastic and under 10$. The meat was flavourful and well cooked, and the rolls were very fresh tasting, quite a departure from what you'd expect at an AYCE place. The box also comes with dumplings, rice, salad, and miso soup. Everything tasted great and we both left feeling satisfied but not stuffed. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"We were just in the store at 10:30pm and they asked us to do take out although they close at 11pm. They said there is no one else in the store and they'd like to close early. I thought this was really rude. I would highly ask everyone not to go there."}
{"text":"Gonoe Sushi Japanese Restaurant is a really good sushi restaurant in the don mills and eglinton area.  The flavours and the quality are unmatched by other sushi restaurants in Toronto.

While working in the area, I ate here once a week with co-workers and the food was great and fresh every single time.

I recommend everything on the menu - from the sushi pizza to the dragon roll - everything is delicious.

Price wise good quality sushi always costs a little more."}
{"text":"I tried this local sushi restaurant for the first time: it will be the last. Neither the timeliness of the delivery or the politeness of the delivery man could compensate for the fact that, overall, the sushi meal was disappointing, which is the reason I am giving this location only two stars, and likely no repeat business. 

The size of the Ikura sushi was the smallest I have ever tried, ditto for the Uni and the Smelt Roe. The portions were skimpy, poorly rolled, with my Ikura rolls becoming dismantled and falling apart, eggs akimbo. I had asked that the Uni order be packed separately from the main meal (since my boyfriend is allergic), and, when the order arrived, the Uni was flat on its side, separated from the rice, and looking very slap-dash.  The Salmon & Avocado roll we ordered was passable, but not especially fresh tasting, partly because the rice was quite hard. Thinly sliced bits of wilted cucumber were nestled in my messy Ikura sushi, as well as in my Uni: the sad sliver of vegetation looked more like a hasty afterthought. 

Skimpy portions, poor presentation, and the lackluster fish quality make it very easy to justify eating elsewhere. When the food you are eating, especially sushi, looks like it was prepared by a chef having a bad day, it doesn't set the stage for becoming a regular customer. 

My vote: Passable. Just barely."}
{"text":"Very good calm setting. Has a lot of small booths. Friendly staff. Good sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered the Agedashi Tofu and Salmon Sushi Pizza. The tofu came out okay but the sushi pizza is a whole different story.

The salmon looked it was one of the pre-cut meat that belonged on the discount shelf. It looked NOTHING like the photo nor does it look like a sushi pizza at all. Honestly, it looked like that specific dish had been sitting there for God knows how long. Even frozen salmon doesnt look like that after you thaw it.

I do not recommend this place nor will I ever come back again."}
{"text":"Consistent food quality and great service!

I used to go to school around the area and I didn't discover this gem until a few years ago. The special rolls and bento boxes never disappoint. Serving size is very generous and I always walk out feeling more than satisfied. While I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, it's definitely a good standby if I want sushi in the general vicinity. Overall, superb value and a great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I have a little space in my heart for Ganoe.

The sushi is really tasty, the chirachi bowl is a favourite. The prices are pretty average for a sushi place, maybe a $1 or $2 more than some places in Markham. For some reason I think it's a weird spot for a sushi place, but there is another one right down the street from it. I probably think it's odd because I'm not usually in that part of town.

I liked the atmosphere a lot, there are quiet a few booths and the service was pretty good as well.

On Don Mills just south of of Lawrence, on the west side of the street. There is parking."}
{"text":"Great food. Went for lunch - great menu with lots of options for lunch.  Service was good, atmosphere is excellent.  Enjoyable place for a quiet sushi meal with a friend."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty frequently if we're not getting take out sushi (which is good :D)

But we at here today and I'll just say there were a few things wrong with the order/cutlery. We let the waiters know. They were very courteous and apologetic.
We even got some unexpected free Gyoza's as an apology. That's the way to do business.

It's nice to eat at a restaurant that shows good business sense and has good food for decent prices

Would definitely still go back"}
{"text":"I have consistently enjoyed meals at this restaurant. The food is excellent, the service is terrific (I usually end up there on a Sunday night, so can't comment on the lunchtime or other issues other reviewers have reported). My 2 year old gets a great reception too, which means a lot to me. 
The food is tasty & fresh, not too oily (w.r.t. fried things). When I've ordered maki for my toddler, they automatically sent it out without wasabi, which I didn't think to ask for. A great restaurant; I will certainly return."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Gonoe and used to go 2 or 3 times a week.  However, now with less time on my hands I only get to go once a week.  The price is definitely not cheap but reasonable for good quality food.  Th sashimi is always fresh and the rolls very tasty.  I would also recommend their Kalbi.  I think they call the type of Kalbi they have LA Kalbi, and the meat is really soft, tender, and delicious.  

Highly recommended and the reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there are other top Japanese restaurants like Kaji Sushi...but the price is wayyyyy more expensive there."}
{"text":"Came here mostly for the location, looking to satisfy our sushi craving at a place nearby. We ordered the 20 pc sashimi platter, and three rolls. Overall they were pretty good and the sashimi was fresh! Only downside was the lack of AC making it quite uncomfortable while we were eating. That being said, service was fast and it's definitely the best sushi place I've tried in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Yes, it is definitely a 4 star.

It is a Japanese / Korean Restaurant.

The sashimi is very fresh. It is chef special dinner with 20 pcs of sashimi($23). The spicy beef dinner ( $15) cooked perfect with good enough hot and spicy taste. All comes with miso soup, steam rice, salad and ice-cream.

The service is good. The waitress responses fast.

Price = food + quailty + service

It is a good place when you are in the neigbourhood for regular lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to eat sushi in town. The fish is super fresh and their seaweed salad is amazing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very central.... Close to union station. 
...close to home. I think l its ideal for Friday evening after work .... I like how spacious it is
Drinks are served right away....loving it !"}
{"text":"Waitress was so nice and the menu is full if good options. I hardly recommend the tofu teriyaki bento and the udon soups. You can even ask to get them without egg. Sushi is just great! It's a nice hidden restaurant!"}
{"text":"They gave me sashimi with skin on it and said \"some people like to eat. You should let us know ahead of time if you don't like it.\" Never come again"}
{"text":"If you like crazy rolls that's not all you can eat you should come here. It's not run by Japanese people so it has a Korean influence but they have a large variety of rolls and most of them are around $12 and have around 8-10 pieces per roll. Sometimes when we go there we get some free hand rolls or little appetizers for free. I like it much better than the cheap Chinese run Tako sushi. The rice bowls (dons) are pretty good and cheap. The service is good and the place is very clean. Fish is fresh and rolls are presented nicely in a boat.  

moderate price range, a meal for two of us is around 45-50 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant. I'm not from Toronto but their Gonoe roll is amazing. Whenever I go to Toronto I try to make my way to this location. The service is great too."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Reasonable prices during lunch. The fish is pretty good and their specialty maki choices are great."}
{"text":"I am SO SO surprised by some of the negative reviews here! Every time I've come to Gonoe, it's an amazing sushi experience. Their service can be a bit slow but that's because they are usually slammed when we arrive. They have a great selection of rolls, sushi, and sashimi as well as appetizers. The agedashi tofu is alwaaaayys delicious and the sushi is so fresh it actually tastes sweet. 

The rolls are so different from anywhere else, I've never ever had even an inkling that something wasn't fresh or well prepared. In addition, the udon noodle soups are to die for. This is my absolute go to place for incredible sushi in the city, besides Yasu on Harbord (totally different type of resto though) there is no other sushi restaurant that can beat Gonoe. Oh and the atmosphere is so relaxed, lovely dinner every time!"}
{"text":"My mom and I usually go to Tako Sushi right beside, since it's pretty cheap and fast, but I wanted to try Gonoe since I hadn't been before. I was impressed right away with the decor, it was beautiful! We sat at a table, but I loved the sushi bar. It looked like a traditional Japanese eatery, which I liked. They had lots of variety on the menu with some unusual rolls, but everything sounded good. I believe you can customize your own roll if you want, which is pretty cool. The waitress was very kind, and the food we ordered was very yummy! The fish was very good quality and fresh. It is a bit pricey, but the experience and food is worth it if you want a nice night out."}
{"text":"Went: 12:00 pm Fri Jun 12 2015 (12th couple date)
Ordered: Sushi and Sashimi
Cost: incl. tax and tip $25-30
We went for lunch on a weekday.  We ordered two lunch special.  
Food: The food was really fresh, especially the sashimi.  
Environment: It was busy and the service was a bit slow. we had to ask for our bills, and they check in on you too infrequently. However, I rate restaurants 90% on the food and here it is excellent.
Bottom line: I would definitely come back. Good sushi and sashimi does not really taste that different from other places that do it well, so if you want a solid place to go to, this is one of them."}
{"text":"Went to visit the old sushi place that was here (Ichiban I think) and instead found this restaurant

I'd have to say the food was so great, the service so good that it trumps any neighbouring sushi places by far.

Even the price was what to expect (or even cheaper) because of the amount of food we ordered.

We had a large sushi boat the second time we went, was great!

The first time we went we had the 2 person dinner combo and we couldn't even finish it!

Def. a nice place and hope it stays there for a long time.."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi / Korean spot. I work in the area and I eat here a lot. It's a small restaurant and can be very busy during the week at lunch time, so come early. Some tips: park underground - parking on the ground level is usually busy. Don't go if you are in a rush. Go back often to try more things on the menu.

Pros:
Great tasting food, large portions, and large selection of Japanese, and Korean dishes. The staff is friendly, and the booths are nice if you need or want privacy.

Cons:
Small restaurant. Service can be slower making it hard to go there for a quick lunch.

Recommendations:
Sushi Pizza - one of the best I've had
Green Dragon Roll
Uni sushi
Crispy Tuna & Salmon handroll
Kalbi Beef
Kimchi
Gyoza dumplings
All sushi cuts are fresh and large portions"}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, things can go terribly wrong if you dont do it right. This place does it right. The fish is fresh, the rolls are amazing and their spicy mayo..mmm. 

Their pricing is comparable to most sushi places.
Their service is ok but that doesnt leave a dent in my review because it isnt easy finding fresh good sushi done right. The place is clean and overall every experience has been a good one. Ill keep coming back if they maintain this quality."}
{"text":"The only thing that's keeping this review from being a 1 star is because their food is actually delicious. The service at this location is alway slow, and they never offer you anything to drink until 5 minutes after you already had sat down. They also have a lunch menu during the weekdays until 3:30pm, but God help you if you order THE LUNCH BENTO BOXES. The servers give you a dirty look when you order their lunch boxes, like you've done some high wrong. I'm one person, I can't eat a lot! If they don't like people ordering lunch sizes, then don't offer it on the menu! So as for the bento choices, you can also order a bento box with one meat choice, or one meat choice with tempura. I've realized Within a couple of minutes from ordering that I forgot to say I would like tempura with my bento box, the server insisted that she was now going to charge me full price for the tempura now. Really? Why? Cause you don't know how to put the same portion of tempura to cook like you would of had when I ordered it the first time? The server is not friendly and I am honestly a regular at this location as I live right around the corner. I will not return to the place again. Horrible service."}
{"text":"I'm more or less a regular here, and while not everything on the menu is amazing it's all above par. Dynamite rolls are top notch."}
{"text":"Pretty fancy sushi, could be a lil pricey but I don't mind coming back. The experience dining here wasn't too bad but it could get crowded and you'd be seated probably just 3 inches away from the next table"}
{"text":"I have eaten here dozens of times.
The fish is fresh.
The staff are nice.
The restaurant is intimate.
The location is out of the way - nothing else around.
I always order the tempura veg, spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll.  No complaints."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for when we want a sushi meal out. Good food, good service. Seems like it's always busy, so best to make a reservation if you're going for dinner."}
{"text":"Very average sushi. I live in the area and the usual sushi place I go to is closed on Sundays. We ordered a mix of a la carte items....as it was more expensive to order a spicy salmon and tuna maki combo vs. ordering those rolls a la carte :s As well, Gonoe did not have a great selection of cheap maki/sushi/sashmi combos like most other sushi places I have been to

Maki Rolls (2/5)
- Spicy Tuna 
- Salmon Avacado

The maki rolls were very tiny with barely any fish in them. Most spicy tuna rolls I have had before do not come with cucumber and lettuce in them. Seemed like a cheap way to fill the rolls by skimping on the fish. 

Sushi Pizza (4/5)
- Salmon 
The sushi pizza was probably the best item I ordered (hard to mess up something deep fried with raw fish on top). The rice tempura part was nice and crispy but not too greasy like some other sushi pizza I have had. It was topped with mayo, salmon, and avacado (decent portions of both). 

Sea weed salad (3/5)
- A tad on the soggy side

Service (4/5)
- I found the service to be friendly and attentive. However I came in at 8:30pm on a Sunday so the restaurant was not that busy. 

Atmosphere (3.5/5)
- Traditional Japanese atmosphere with booths
- Intimate, cozy feeling inside the restaurant 
- Not that large, so not great/comfortable for groups larger than 6 people 

Would I return? 
Not likely, unless I happen to get a sushi craving again on a Sunday when my usual go to place is closed and I want the convenience of Gonoe, as it is right down the street."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I got carry out sushi from here because my usual place was closed. I won't be going again. The sushi is maybe one small step up from grocery store sushi. Rice was undercooked and the sushi barely had any fish in it."}
{"text":"This is one of me and my boyfriend's favourite sushi places! The food is always fresh, with good portion sizes! We usually order salmon chirashi with butterfish! And it's never frozen like the previous place we went to."}
{"text":"On my quest to find good sushi at reasonable price I came across Ganoe. Its tucked away on Don Mills Road, a little before Shops at Don Mills.

The sashimi was just ok. We tried the Albacore Tuna an fit was not served at the right temperature, it was so cold that there was ice sticking them together. 

We also tried a few rolls, an albacore tuna roll (blowtorched), Spicy Scallop and Dynamite. The spicy scallop was my favourite and the dynamite was a dud. Albacore tune was was very tasty.

If you want to eat a lot of sushi that is not bad, then this is a good place to go to satisfy your immediate cravings. None of the that rolls were exceptional but the price was good."}
{"text":"First we had to wait while the waitress played with her phone to be seated. After looking at the lunch menu for about 10 minutes, we were informed that lunch is not served on Sundays. We decided at that point to just pay for our tea and leave. After waiting again for the waitress to put down her phone and acknowledge us, we paid and left. Probably won't bother coming back when lunch is offered. When ever that is, anyways."}
{"text":"This is the second Gonoe Sushi location that I know of and it is consistent in service and food quality. The fish is fresh and the hot dishes are well prepared. Prices are comparable to other sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little place with great service and food quality. Came here multiple times for lunch (lots of lunch special menu). It does get pretty busy on week day lunch time, so I'd say come a little before noon. 

I like their sushi boat for non-lunch menu. Really good quality of fish! Price is comparable to other sushi places, but the quietness and the quality of food makes me come here often."}
{"text":"My family and I recently moved here from Cali and we're looking for our go to sushi spot. The place was cute and not super busy so we were seated right away. The wait staff was very nice and polite. The sushi however liked anything to be desired. The sashimi pieces were the smallest I have ever seen and the rolls were forgettable. The udon noodles my kids got were overpriced. Nothing was bad it just wasn't great. We will continue our search...."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this place has been open. At least 10 years. ... FYI it used to be Japanese run but now it is Korean run.  When the switch happened many Korean items were added to the menu such as the bulgogi and kalbi. 
I love this place because the fish is always very fresh and portions are generous. It is on the pricier side but  the quality and authentic taste is worth it.

Best sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh flounder. The whole fish is flown in from South Korea (this is a fact) and cut to order at the restaurant. The combos start at around $70 and include 1 whole flounder (sashimi style), spicy fish and tofu soup, tempura, side dishes, and raw veggies to eat with the flounder. The next combo is around $90 with more food and a bottle of soju (A LOT of food...) 

The restaurant also had other Korean dishes, and other great sushi dishes. Parking in this plaza is highly packed, especially during weekends. Alternative: Park at the plaza just across the street and walk over :)"}
{"text":"Sushi quality is pretty good but if you're Asian don't expect them to pay you any attention. They don't refill your tea or look at you. The decor is nice and food is well-presented but that's also what you're paying for.

Chirashi $18 and Salmon bento box $21"}
{"text":"We really liked their maki that we ordered as an appetizer. We are huge fans of unagi, but their Unagi Don did not taste like unagi at all. It was somewhat surprising because the unagi in maki tasted great. Beef teriyaki was tasty but nothing special, though comparing to weird Unagi Don we were at least sure it was beef. 
Otherwise, service was fast and friendly, and the place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I moved to Toronto years ago but the food quality has gone downhill.

I ordered takeout today: one diablo roll, one scallop deluxe roll which were my usual. When I opened the box, they were the smallest rolls I've ever seen in my life. There was barely any content in them and the scallop roll was just unbearably fishy. Typically sushi places compensate with more rice than filling but these rolls had neither. Won't be returning again."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time to celebrate my birthday with my family and I am very happy with my experience. I made a reservation for 6:30pm and we were promptly seated in one of their nice and cozy little booths that are curtained off. My whole family enjoyed their meals. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento and was very satisfied with my portion of chicken and tempura. Our server was also really pleasant and kept refilling our tea without us having to ask. I will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have this little restaurant in this neighbourhood. The food is always fresh and the people always friendly.

They offer a tiny adorable bowl of complimentary noodle soup with your order. Miso soup features enoki mushrooms, tofu pieces and seaweed. Salad is made with a house made vinaigrette.

Dishes are traditional with some Korean influences, like bento boxes with bulgogi or kalbi. It's all a welcome change from the neighbourhood tourist traps. A little pricier then comparable sushi places elsewhere, but worth it in my opinion because the food is always consistently good.

The restaurant itself is quiet and great for a nice evening out. It can get quiet busy on weekends, but I've still never had to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday night and it was not too busy.  My friend and I got a dining table at a semi private room.  There are a few semi private rooms to separate the 4-people dining tables.  If you are looking for some privacy,  this is a good place to go! 

I ordered 2 rolls and found the food portion a little smaller than usual. The food was not bad but I was a little disappointed with the warm rice. Price was acceptable for sushi.  

Service was so-so.  Good thing they kept filling our tea,  but I didn't like it when they presented the bill to our table before we decided to leave and asked for it (given there was no line up and it had not reached closing hour yet)."}
{"text":"I came with friends on Saturday for lunch. We came here because we couldn't find a cool place to sit for the Taiwan Fest at the Harbourfront. Their lunch menu was not available so we ordered from dinner menu. I got the vegetable udon and my friends got tempura on rice and bulgogi on hot plate. The place had nice decor but the food was so so nothing special. The portion size is big for the price. I was very full from my udon. After we finished food we wanted to stay a bit longer to chat because my friend was visiting from out of country and the restaurant was not full but the waitress came by with our bills even though we didn't ask for it indirectly implying we should leave. So we left. Otherwise it was alright but there are better places."}
{"text":"Came here last week. Perfectly adequate sushi. Had a bento box with tempura, teriyaki, salmon rolls and other assorted goodies. My girlfriend had a combo of spicy salmon and spicy tuna. Friendly staff and quick service ( we came quite late in the evening and were hungry) Quiet with that old school sushi shop decor (little covered booths and Japanese prints) 

Decent spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"tried their sushi+sashimi+hand roll lunch sushi bar combo that came with complimentary soup and salad. it came as 3 nigiri (salmon, tuna, red snapper), 3 california maki, 9 sashimi (3 each of salmon, tuna, and red snapper), and spicy salmon handroll.

the nigiri was very firm (didn't fall apart when picked up) and had wasabi between the rice and the meat (as it should be). all of their meat are very fresh.

the server was very friendly and attentive. dining time was very fast and there was not much stalling time because soup and salad arrived almost immediately after order was made, and the main dish arrived almost immediately after soup and salad were finished.

overall it's a very good experience with well prepared sushi made by chef that knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot close to home. Amazing fresh fish, reasonable prices, and nice little booths with curtains for dinner that you can actually have a conversation around... Isn't that the point of food!? So much nicer to eat here then the overcrowded \"all hype\" sushi spots that lack The specialness factor. Please check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent casual Japanese dining! The sashimi is fresher and served in larger portions than most other restraunts at the same price point. The bento boxes are of reasonable value, with teriyaki dishes that are not drenched with the sauce. The tempura breading is light and not overly fried. The maki rolls have fresh ingrediants and the rice has good texture."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever experienced. They gave me Amaebi that was microwaved to defrost. I could tell from the hard clump texture that I felt while biting into the sashimi and how warm the shrimp was. Which is regularly a softer texture and a delicate shellfish to serve. I had mild food poisoning from this. We also ordered Kalbi and it came out still raw in some spots ( red/bloody). When advised to the staff that this had happened they screamed at us in front of customers and told us we have to pay for it no matter what. Even though it was uncooked ( kalbi) and amaebi was no longer in raw form but half cooked form. Overall been here 2 times and never had a good experience. The staff were also never available either when it came time for us to pay for the items that were somewhat ok to still eat. 

Do not confuse this Gonoe with the one on 5 Glen Cameron, who happen to actually be five star and serve amazing quality sashimi and maki !  

I DONT recommend this be your first choice in a sushi restaurant. Many better options even for AYCE."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a few friends that had been hyping up this place for a week about the quality and very reasonable price for lunch.  I got the chirashi lunch for 10.95 and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the fish was, especially the white tuna that was SOOOOO good.  My friends get the unagidon bento nearly every time they come so we'd definitely recommend that as well.  Super friendly service, will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Food was a minus - felt I would have gotten better elsewhere, poor value, below average
Customer service a double minus - I was given the absolute minimum of service, wanted to get more tea, but the waitress was never around my entire meal, while in an empty restaurant. When it came time to pay, I went to the front, since I hadn't seen waitress around at all. It was not that she was busy, she was simply lazy.

I thought this place was simply trying to serve tourists / ppl down at Habourfront, and didn't try at all to make an effort at customer retention

Would not return"}
{"text":"This place is good for great sushi at a cheap price.  I am a bit of a Sushi snob but for the price and quick service I come here to get my sushi fix.  However, for some reason I ordered the salmon terriyaki and it was totally not worth it.  I got one small piece of salmon filled with a plate of Onions and a bowl of rice.... I am not sure if they were trying to be cheap with their food or just thought I would not notice... but now I know that if I go to a SUSHI place order some Sushi instead of alternatives.

Their sushi is great and reasonably priced and it is pretty busy here every single time I come.  Nothing that is out of this world but good enough to satisfy your Sushi cravings"}
{"text":"Gonoe special was pretty tasty. Freshness was only average compared to other sushi restaurants. The male server was great. The young women server/cashier, on the other hand, seemed to have inferiority complex and made me feel awkward for no apparent reason. She wanted me to pay and leave. Next time, I will try the big sushi restaurant right beside Gonoe."}
{"text":"Consistently fresh sushi with short wait times for take-out and good service when dining in. My boyfriend and I frequent this spot regularly for take-out sushi but we decided to dine-in today. 

We ordered the spicy bulgogi which had great flavour but was too spicy for our taste. We shared the gyoza which was perfectly crispy with a flavourful, tender interior. The salmon sashimi appetizer came with thicker pieces than I would typically get from other sushi spots, and the spicy salmon roll had fresh tempura bits and the perfect amount of spicy sauce. 

Overall this is a good choice for sushi in the downtown core that won't cost you $20 for 6 pieces of sushi."}
{"text":"I love sushi. Been coming here for the past 2.5 years for take-out and dine-in and it is the best sushi in this area. I visited on a Friday night, Valentines Day and the place was packed. They provide these little noodle pre-appetizers that I always look forward to. They have a wonderful dinner for 2 package if you're really hungry. I particularly love the soft-shell crab. Its nice and quiet and they have 3 private booths."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place since it was highly reviewed on Yelp.. The rolls are pretty decent but they are very small with a lot of rice! We ordered 3 rolls which was plated on a boat and it looked so small and sad."}
{"text":"Not bad, they got several tasty sushis. We ordered the ones listed on the recommendation menu and they all taste good."}
{"text":"Love this place because location is right! Quiet atmosphere for late dinner time, and every time I've come here, I always get seated in the semi private booths which is nice. I usually get the dynamite explosion or black dragon roll and really enjoy them every time. We never have sashimi or raw fish so can't comment on that. 

I find the specialty rolls to be a pretty good main serving. Maybe have an appetizer to share and that's all you'll need."}
{"text":"Authentic! The fish is fresh and fatty. Tempura don is tasty and comes with a separated sauce bowl, nice touch. The only thing that could be improved for me is I think sushi needs some more vinegar in the rice. Staffs are Japanese and nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a salmon combination dinner and a scallop roll, and we weren't super impressed with the quality of the food for the price. It's not bad, but doesn't really stand out in our books!"}
{"text":"A surprisingly good place with very fresh sushi. Big so it doesn't get very crowded. 
The price is decent as well.

Bento box and appetizers and all those cooked stuff are ok. But sushi and sashimi trays and the raw stuff are really highlights of this restaurant.You can't go wrong with that.

In my opinion, it's better than the Oyshi sushi nearby."}
{"text":"Came here for the live octopus and it was such a cool experience! It's kind of expensive but def worth trying it out. Sushi and sashimi were super fresh too. Make reservations and ask for the private booths - it's more fun with friends!"}
{"text":"You know it wan't really like WOW sushi. It was good, better than grocery store sushi.I think I was expecting better so I have to rate at 3 stars because of the lack of motivation on going back for more."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm really surprised at how disappointed I was with Gonoe. I've been keeping tabs of Gonoe for years. I live about five/ten minutes away, and I've never come. I've been meaning to go for a while, seeing as Gonoe has a four star Yelp rating, and it's been around for a while even with larger Japanese restaurants super close by, so I figured there must be a reason it survived. Now having gone to Gonoe, I have absolutely no idea how they are still in business.

We came as a party of four. It took the servers between five and ten minutes to come to ask us our beverage orders (tea), and another five to ten minutes before they brought our tea. This to me seems to indicate a lack of servers. 

We ordered a sashimi dinner, a hamachi kama, a tempura dinner, and a legendary dragon roll. They gave us each a complimentary taster of soup noodles at the start of our meal.

At about $12, the hamachi kama was probably the best dish we had all night. It was a good portion for that price, but my mom thought it could have been served hotter (temperature-wise). 

The sashimi for the sashimi dinner was cut unevenly (some pieces being fairly thin on one end and thicker on the other end, and other pieces just being super thin) and the variety was cheap (salmon, red tuna, red snapper/tilapia, octopus, white tuna). 

The legend dragon roll ($13.95) was marketed as a soft shell crab roll wrapped in salmon and unagi. I have never seen such a meager wrapping of seafood on any sushi roll before. They were so thin that they were translucent. I couldn't even taste the eel. 

The shocker of the night was the tempura dinner. I'm not sure whether this is a variant on tempura shrimp that I am not aware of, but the tempura I am accustomed to is battered, then fried. This was breaded in panko, then fried. It was tempura colored, but the texture was all wrong. The breading actually cracked in the middle of the shrimp and separated off of the shrimp. It was also thick and had an awkward mouth feel. I am actually completely befuddled by this, especially because their veggie tempura was battered the way I am accustomed to having tempura. 

I asked if this Gonoe is affiliated with the Gonoe in Thornhill. I was told they used to be affiliated, but no longer. This Gonoe is now affiliated with Hamaru at York Mills and Leslie. Hamaru doesn't do tempura this way. I really and truly do not understand. They should have stayed affiliated with the Gonoe in Thornhill. The Gonoe in Thornhill does tempura right. 

After my first experience at this Gonoe Sushi, I really never want to come again."}
{"text":"We were in toronto on vacation and tried this place. I had the chirashi lunch special, only 11 bucks, and was pretty darn fresh and tasty and a decent portion for the money. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"The black dragon was delicious. Would recommend :)

The sashimi is meh. It's not bad but it's not great. They had Toro on the menu. 2 pieces of sashimi =$15."}
{"text":"Gonoe: The best sushi restaurant I've had so far in this area (Don Mills )! Great selection of food : Menu is very broad with some unique items ex: Kalbi sushi roll, Canadian Bacon Roll.  Portions are quite plentiful and the quality on the outstanding side :D . Word of warning: Because it's so good and the place is small tends to get packed at peek hours. There is also underground parking if the lot is full."}
{"text":"Wait time was a bit long tho we went to a busy time
Sushi it self was pretty good, the udon soup taste very bland and the chicken kastu donburi is mehhh..."}
{"text":"We were looking for food after we checked out an art exhibition at Harbourfront Centre and stumbled upon this small sushi restaurant. It's a nice a little place to eat late at night as everything else was closed on a Friday night. We ordered the sushi and maki boat and it was quite good and nicely presented. Service was good and the staff were friendly. It's a nice place to eat sushi with the nice decor and the private booths. Overall, a nice dining experience. Will definitely be back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 for a mid-week dinner at 7pm and there were still plenty of tables and parking available. Its in a inconspicuous dark plaza with just a Caribbean place next to it. The heating in the restaurant could also be turned up, as we were eating I was getting really cold sitting in there. 

We got the large sashimi and sushi boat to share between 5 people, $90 for 86 pieces. There was complimentary miso soup and salad to start. There was a good selection of fish including octopus and eel. The maki rolls were good, the rice held up and wasn't mushy. The sashimi though was disappointing, I bit into some of the fish the middle was frozen and still hard."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem!

Ordered takeout a la carte to cheer up my BF who had a terrible day (sushi is his fave).

Service was polite and friendly. I ordered a California roll, TTR roll, green dragon, Diablo roll, yam/avocado, and two miso soups. The rolls were prepared fresh in front of me and very quickly too!

I had about a half hour drive home (thanks rush hour traffic!) but the sushi was still absolutely delish! The BF loved his surprise too :)

My faves were the Diablo, loved the pickled peppers in the roll and the TTR which was tuna and green onion sushi roll, fried. OMG so so yum! Be warned the Diablo roll is spicy so if you aren't into heat, don't order.

I will be sure to return when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I loved going here. It was really random and we went during the weekday. The food was good, the staff was very friendly. Decent price + decent sizes."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre for an a la carte sushi place. Came here after a long day at the harbour front. The service was a bit slow, for a small place I expected to get things faster. Especially since I came on a downtime at around 4pm on a weekday.

Forgot my order didn't get my sushi roll till the end. But the servers apologized sincerely, and it seems like they simply just forgot. Ordered sashimi for two, tempera udon, and spicy salmon roll."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and the price vs portion was really well. Lunch specials are great, sushi was fresh!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am south of 401, north of Eglinton and east of Leslie and wanting sushi, Ganoe is always the place that comes to mind.

This place is small, but it always hits the spot for me. I'd say they are consistent, better than your non-Japanese owned places and not too expensive. They like things a certain Japanese way too which I appreciate. I'm reading from others that this place is Korean run? Doesn't matter, I still think it's better than normal.

I remember one time going the waitress put down the plates, soya sauce holder, chop sticks and in specific place on the table for each person. When she stepped away it was moved a bit and then when she came back she adjusted the placements again. That might turn some people off but I respect the order she has.

I've had their rolls, their lunches, their sashmi. All are spot on. We're not like paying off the wall prices so it's not off the wall sushi, but it's better than AYCE!"}
{"text":"Came last night for dinner. We ordered seafood udon, Las Vegas Roll and Dynamite Explosion Roll. Everything was delicious. Service was a bit slow since they were busy (a bunch of people waiting for tables and others waiting for takeout). Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest place to go. Service was terrible with just a few guests in the restaurant. Didn't recieve drink till 45 minutes into service, food started coming out after 1.5hrs. I don't blame the service as much as there was just one server working. The kalbi was alright, tender but was not hot when served. Also ordered a tempura udon, was pretty decent though the soup tasted similar to instant noodle soup but slightly richer. We also got a 3 person sushi boat. Fish size and quality was very good. They seem to fill it with 'sushi fillers' though. Food was slightly over priced for a few items. 
Overall: 3/5
Service: 2/5 (they're too slow, need to hire more waitress) 
Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Quality: 2.5/5
Cleanliness: 2.8/5 (could be higher though there were small flies constantly flying around)"}
{"text":"This place felt very over priced for what I got. Friend and I ordered the hand roll set which came with a bunch of sashimi, sushin California roll pieces, and a hand rolls. It was still a good amount but there are places that definitely give you more for cheaper. To which I would usually think, if the portion is less, the quality should be better. But it wasnt. The fish didnt seem particularly fresh. My white tuna looked old - it should be glossy throughout but the edges looked like they were drying out. My salmon was cut poorly in that one piece broke in two as I was picking it up... 

For $14.95, there are better places to go with more and fresher sushi."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This place has good friendly service. I have eaten here a few times now. Their kalbi sushi roll is a must try and I really enjoyed the udon, the noodles were superbly fresh, thick and soft. I didn't enjoy their beef teriyaki but the Bento box lunch had a good variety of sides. Their chicken katsu Bento box was great. Chicken was moist and the batter was light, crispy and flaky. Overall, their dishes are either great or just under average depending what you order. Prices are slightly higher than what I'd like but it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"Honestly it should be a 3.8/5 but considering their fish is fresh 4/5 is still reasonable. The rice is a bit too hard and doesn't go well with the fresh soft melting fish unfortunately. 

Sashimi 10 piece: 4.5/5. Fresh. 

Las Vegas roll: 4.3/5. Cream cheese used to be my biggest fear in sushi shops but this one was gooooood.

Diablo's roll with spicy tuna: 2/5.  this kind of \"adventure\" is why so many human beings refuse to try new stuff. 

California roll: 3.5/5. Well it's a California roll."}
{"text":"For the neighbourhood i would say this is the best sashimi. Compared to its competition next door it's not all you can eat which is positive in my point of view. Prices are reasonable, sushi is fresh for midtown expectations. It's very convenient for me and it's a treat to have instead of cooking. We used to come here once a month so we are pretty much regulars. Try the rainbow roll very tasty!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place numerous times and never thought to try it out given that Matsuda is located right next to it. I decided to give it a shot as I was in the area and just wanted to grab a quick bite and I'm so glad I did! I've only had sushi from this place twice but I must say it's probably one of my favourite sushi places in Toronto so far. It's a very small restaurant (and small parking space) but I love the ambience and the traditional, comfortable feel of the place. I haven't eaten here but have ordered take-out, and I remember waiting a bit longer than usual but it was worth the wait in my opinion. I ordered the dragon roll which is one of my favourite rolls, and wasn't really expecting much but it definitely exceeded all the rolls I've tried before. It tasted super fresh as compared to some regular ACE sushi restaurants. It was slightly pricer (only by $2-$3)  than some other sushi restaurants but given the quality of the food, I think it's worth it. I've also tried some of the salmon sushi, but the rolls were definitely my favourite. Looking forward to dining in for my next visit and trying some new dishes!"}
{"text":"Friday night, great time for a girls night out. Especially after a gruelling day of work, what better than SUSHI?? 3 of us were starving and ordered the following: Spicy Tuna Tempura ($7.95), Tiger Roll ($9.95), Black Dragon Roll ($12.95), Gonoe Roll ($13.95), Smoky spider ($12.95) and Gyoza ($4.95), yes we ate a lot for 3 ladies. We figured we would go with the \"premium rolls\" because you can get the regular stuff anywhere, and technically isn't that the true test of a sushi chef? to see how far out of the box they can go to create something truly yummy?? So lets take this one step at a time. First we got complementary edamame and what I think was miso soup with noodles. The edamame was edamame, I don't really think you can mess up edamame so lets move on to the soup.  I was super happy when this came to the table because it was absolutely frigid outside. I touched the outside of the mini bowl, which is more like a chinese tea cup and I think to myself, shouldn't this be hot?? I bring it up to my lips, unfortunately it was all kinds of disappointing. First it was luke warm and I suspect that the noodles have been sitting in the broth for a little too long as they were mushy. NO FORGIVENESS FOR MUSHY NOODLES!! The Gyozas came out next. If  you are at all familiar with asian food, they're essentially fried dumplings. When I was growing up it was one of the few foods I loved eating, whenever I would go to a chinese food court with my parents it would always be fried dumplings and Sweet and Sour pork.. mmmmmmmm. But I digress. So either way I have a soft spot for dumplings, and yes yes I know Gyozas are a little different, different filling, different dumpling skin, BUT these were nicely crispy and good... but dripping in oil, I don't so much mind dripping in oil usually, but it just seemed like they set up the dish, put down a paper towel in it then dropped the dumplings straight from the frying pan so once all the Gyozas were in our tummies all I could think of was from that episode of the simpsons when Dr Nick was with Homer and he rubs a drum stick on a piece of paper and says \"if the paper turns clear, its your window to weight gain, good bye every body!\" Alright, time for sushi! My fav out of the 5 rolls we ordered was a tie between the Gonoe Roll and Black Dragon, both completely different flavours but amazing in their own right. The Gonoe roll was tempura battered with the general freshness you get from a piece of sushi but wait a min, theres something different, JALAPENO! it gives the roll an interesting texture but adds a great hit of heat towards the end, you just gotta make sure you eat this roll quick as the deep frying process makes it taste like mush if it sits around too long. The Black dragon consisted of a tempura shrimp, black caviar, unagi and a surprisingly fresh taste, I want to say there was cucumber in there somewhere, but I didn't see it, my counterparts said there was a bit of a temperature difference in the roll, but whatever it was made for that wonderful unique palette experience. The smokey spider roll was my next fav, I'm not a huge smoked salmon person, but I can see the appeal, also its a little different than having regular salmon on everything. I personally feel that the smoked salmon flavour took over the soft shell crab, but I liked the bit of a crunch from the fried crab and the softness of the smoked salmon. The next two are in a tie for last place. the Tuna Tempura and the Tiger. The tiger consisted of deep fried scallops rolled in Rice and Nori then topped with salmon. No flavour, and no texture differential here. This was a super over priced roll for the amount of enjoyment it delivers. Last but not least the Spicy Tuna Tempura roll. This one needs to be given the grade of \"FAIL\"! just like the tiger, it was just flavourless if it weren't for the spicy sauce drizzle on the top. The deep frying process completely cooked the tuna inside, and left us wondering. I just realized that almost everything we ordered was fried, oh well :). Gonoe had nice wait staff and had a nice welcoming feel. I don't know if I'll go back, but If I do, I will most definitely do the gonoe roll and the black dragon again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: small, intimate, they offers seatings inside little huts, clean

Food: 
1. Spider roll: 3/5 nothing particular outstanding, rolls are quite small, soft crab is deep fried , offers a nice crunch 

2. Spicy beef dinner: 3/5 well marinated, comes with rice and soup and salad, tender beef slices 

Overall: nothing particularly stood out, I found prices to be high for portion size. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Super average food and the service wasn't great because they were too busy for what they had staffed.  I got the philly, dragon, and volcano roll and all of them were nothing special while the miso soup was perhaps the saltiest I've ever tasted"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant and they had cute little tatami rooms (but you're not sitting on the floors). Presentation of the food and decor were very cute. Not too pricey compared to where I'm from. Ordered Agedashi Tofu and it came w/4 pieces, nicely battered and fried with the correct dashi. For the main course I got the salmon teriyaki and it wasn't what I expected. It was good, but I think they could improve here. The fish was definitely farm and I was missing the crispy skin. They put it over a sizzling plate topped w/bean sprouts, so it was good. My friend ordered the sashimi platter (S) and it was a very good price for a decent amount of sashimi & sushi! I'd suggest this to friends if they're in the area. Yelp does not disappoint and I'll be back if I ever return to Canada again!"}
{"text":"I've been there three times for dinner, didn't have to wait to be seated. I ordered unagi don and it's very tasty. My friend ordered the uni sushi, and she said it's fresh. The dinner dishes will come with salad and miso soup. There is only one waitress so it take some time to get her to our table, but overall the experience has been great."}
{"text":"Ordered Legend Roll and Dynamite Roll! I'm happy with the quality and definitely was better than average but nothing spectacular. The price is a little bit on the pricier side hence the reason for 3*. Would have been 4* otherwise."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant after I went to a similar place just beside it. I found that the place is more like a Korean restaurant that offers both Japanese and Korean foods. There is quite a selection of food. However, I don't really like the restaurant: the food is overpriced and the interior looked old and not well decorated. I ordered a tempura shrimp lunch box, and even though the portion is pretty big, the\"tempura shrimp\" is actually just fried breaded shrimp. Also, the Katsu is cold and extremely thin. (I felt that I was just eating the bread powder...) Not recommend if you are like me, who is looking for a well decorated and authentic Japanese restaurant, but if you are just looking for something to quickly fill your stomach and do not mind the food so much, the place is probably for you."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Ganoe, they were opened on Christmas Day and we were in the mood for sushi. I made a reservation, we were seated immediately and found the service very attentive. The food was okay, nothing special to me. We ordered their combo meal, for two people, it was $60. This included seaweed salad, salmon sashimi, salmon sushi, dynamite roll and salmon teriyaki with vegetable tempura. We substituted the salmon teriyaki with beef teriyaki and paid $2 extra. The meal also included miso soup and a small noodle appetizer."}
{"text":"It 's not very clean. There were many cockroaches running on my table and under my plate. Be careful if you order sashimi in a wooden boat..."}
{"text":"So here's the thing...I can't use chop sticks, I don't eat fish, I don't like miso soup or green tea so I was thrilled with the menu selection! I had a bento box which was delish! They even switched the shrimp tempura for veggie tempura as per my request. Quiet little spot and I will be back."}
{"text":"Quite tasty and lovely little place. Definitely love their Legend Dragon roll and Gonoe roll~ A good place for special roll lovers like me : )"}
{"text":"it's been a while since i've been to a japanese restaurant that offers such a huge variety of maki rolls.  i almost didn't know how to choose.  i went with a few people and we decided to share a couple dishes.  the rolls were top notch and the sashimi was some of the freshest i've had in a while."}
{"text":"Gonoe is my go-to-neighbourhood sushi spot. If your dining in they are a small cozy, authentic sushi spot with a small sushi bar you can sit at, or some private enclosed tables. 

This is no all you can eat dish, the rolls are full, the sake (salmon) tastes as fresh as you could ask and they have some great rolls. The Lobster roll is especially nice as a treat (not cheap). 

Their sushi and rolls are presented beautifully on boats. Enjoy the great food and equally friendly service."}
{"text":"1 star for the service, 2 stars for the food quality. The servers here are extremely rude and disorganized. At first one lady turned me down because I was looking for a table for 7 and she said they couldn't accommodate. But because it wasn't my first time here I knew there was a back area that was big enough and it didn't look occupied so I asked for the table. Another lady proceeded to ask me to wait for them to clean it. Things went downhill from there. We waited for 15 mins with no service, no water or tea provided. We had to wave someone down about 5 times before a lady came over. She was disgruntled upon us asking for tea saying it's \"$1 extra charge per person\", so we got water. 

Every time the server came by she'd make a rude comment about not being able to place things on the table because of the way we were sitting (which was around the table like we're supposed to), or that we were being too loud. 

Overall, I felt as though they didn't care about their customers or the level of service because they rely too heavily on their take out guests and would prioritize those who were picking up food. I wouldn't recommend dining here as the food isn't worth the lack of service or attention."}
{"text":"This place is a nice hidden gem for good sushi. It's a little small but pretty cozy and I like their panelled private booths. I tried a few different kinds of sushi rolls and it was all very tasty and well prepared. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Small cozy place. The food is good but expensive. When we went the place was full and there was only 1 waitress. After awhile another one came to help out."}
{"text":"Ordered the a small sushi and sashimi boat to share with another person. We both felt the tuna sashimi and sushi arent that fresh. The only item we liked was the eel sushi. It was Friday, the restaurant was busy and the waitress aren't very attentive. For the price we paid, I rather go somewhere else. Would not comeback again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh dishes. Great price point for the quality. Friendly and fast service. Bonus: a few cozy, private dining areas. The spicy albacore tuna roll is my favorite, but every dish I've tried has been great."}
{"text":"UNREAL!

 We are not sushi experts or anything,  but boy was that service and quality perfect!! We had Veggie tempura and Edemama to start. Delicious!!! Our mains were Red Dragon & Las Vegas Roll (outsides) & inside one was a spicy California & Avacado/Cucumber.

 It came on an awesome boat and it was absolutely delicious!  They even threw in a sushi pizza to try after ward since it was our first time there!!! :) :) 

 We have found our new Sushi spot and can't wait to come back!!!! 

Delicious!! A must try, and the location itself is small enough to be intimate yet friendly and inviting for lots of friends! They even have little huts to sit in with curtains!!!


Please look no further.  Come here... NOW! :)"}
{"text":"Small little Japanese restaurant in the Don Mills neighbourhood. Lots of different rolls to pick from. 

Great lunch special selection.

Service is a little slow though. So if you only have 1 hour for lunch, may not be the best place. Take out is pretty quick though."}
{"text":"I met my wife a friend for lunch. There was quits a line up. But it was well worth the wait. 
Beware, though of the parking which is very limited."}
{"text":"I went to this place solely on the recommendations read here on Yelp. 

My first impression of the place is that it's tidy and nicely decorated. That earned a star. 

The waitress were attentive was quick to provide service. 2nd star.


I ordered a sushi and sashimi dinner combo and it came in a tiny boat nicely decorated. 3rd star. 

Where it lost points were 2 things:
- prices of food aren't ridiculous but they are quite high for some items (ie: sushi and sashimi boat starting at 44.95)

- The rice used on sushi and maki were hard. This tells me the rice has been sitting around for a while.

- the fish inside the Maki was warm and the sushi and sashimi fishes were colder but still seems like it's been defrosted for a while

My concern immediately became food safety. This was met with the response of major stomach ache right after I finished the complimentary ice cream. 

Don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not the best I've ever had either.

Here's a list of what I've tried and what I think:
-Eskimo roll (3.5/5)
-Spider roll (4.5/5)
-Lobster roll (4.5/5)
-Salmon skin roll (4.5/5)
-Spicy crab roll (3/5)
-Chicken Katsu don (4.5/5)
-Chicken tempura udon (2/5)

I think the price is pretty fair. In fact, this place has the cheapest spider roll I've seen ($9.95). It's usually $10 + at the other sushi restaurants I've been to. 

The ingredients are fresh and I did like most things I've tried. The first time I visited, they gave a soba noodle soup along with the usual salad and miso soup but the second time around I only got the salad. The restaurant feels clean and the staff are nice so I would come back again and definitely get the chicken Katsu don. 

I look forward to the end of my meal when they give us Milkita candies! If anyone knows where I can buy these in Canada, let me know"}
{"text":"A friend recommended me this place. It is probably one of the tastiest/freshest sushi I have tasted with a reasonable price and good service. I have came here several times after that. 

The location of the restaurant is convenient, there is a bus stop right in front of it. Also, there are plenty of parking spaces for those who drive. Upon walking in, we were given a private table. Most, if not all of the tables are private, Japanese-styled booths. You can also see the chefs making food behind the counter.  

We got several rolls, my favorite was the lobster roll. All the rolls were made well and I could taste the freshness of each of them. It might seem a little pricey, but I believe you get what you paid for. Most of the rolls are 8 large pieces.

Aside from that, the servers are polite and respond well to our requests. 

I would definitely come back here again. It is a great place for special occasions or dates because of how quiet the environment is."}
{"text":"We had the spicy scallop handroll and spicy salmon handroll the spicy tuna sushi the unagi roll tobiko roll and dynamic exp and spider roll. My favorite was the handroll and spicy scallop I would say this place is just as good as haru yes the order took a while because there were a lot of customers and we did order a lot but good service and the sushi was absolutely phenomenal. I can tell they have good quality fish here because there is no smell in the fish. I was dissappointed that they didn't have the moving octopus. I will come back here again"}
{"text":"Another Japanese restaurant owned by non-japanese people with your typical rolls and sashimi...don't ever get the cucumber roll, it taste so gross and not worth the money at all...I'd rather goto a ayce sushi place"}
{"text":"3 stars is usually what I give a place that I don't regret visiting, but nothing really stood out to me either.

Which is basically a perfect description of this place. Just another pleasant enough sushi joint, albeit a little hard to find and not worth the effort to re-find in order to return. The roll I got (I can't even remember which) was pleasant enough, the decor was pleasant enough, the servers were pleasant enough...

Like I said, nothing really stand out. Swing by if you are in the area and looking for a sushi fix. If not, try your luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had Sashimi dinner and blue fin tuna sashimi. Sashimi was fresh and blue fin tuna was worth the extra charge. The white tuna however is not really tuna, however it taste ok. Had a kamikaze maki roll and it was unique; it's good if you can handle some spice. Open on Sundays which is great."}
{"text":"Gonoe, pronounced gone-NO-eh, used to b a pretty decent place for sushi, according to my mom, who lived and studied in Japan during her university days.  Gonoe was previously Japanese-owned, but sometime over the last few years the business has changed hands to a Korean family. Since then, a few Korean additions have been made to the menu.

I ordered the age-dashi tofu sprinkled with green onions ($3.95); the sauce was tasty and quite filling. The only problem was that it came out lukewarm.  I ordered 6 pieces of sweet-potato-and-avocado maki rolls ($4.95), which were incorrectly labeled as yam-and-avocado, and thought they were also decent.  The wasabi here is poorly mixed; I put a giant ball of it in my mouth and I still didn't feel a thing.

My mom ordered the tempura bento, which came with Korean-style potatoes sprinkled with sesame as panchan, a bland salad and a a bowl of lukewarm miso soup.  The tempura was a passing grade. While this place is very popular with the office staff in the area and the prices are resonable, it won't be worth my time to come back again. 

I will admit, however, that it's still a better choice than Tako next door.

{"text":"Always fresh sushi and tasty rolls unlike anywhere else in the city!  Been coming here for years and absolutely love it!  You must try my personal faves;  the Volcano, Las Vegas, Kalbi, and Special rolls...absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, great service. Truly a hidden gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very fresh food, very large position, convenient location. Most of the time no waiting time for seating. But service very very slow. Takes a long time for waiter or waiters to come by. All and all, recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fresh food, generous portions of food, the chef made exactly what we asked for. It is close to home, we love it here!"}
{"text":"Shouldn't have wasted our time here and should've gone uptown for dinner instead. We didn't want to pay extra for additional parking in the downtown area and stuck around Harbourfront. 

Service was horrendous. They were clearly understaffed and were busy on a Sunday evening around 7:30pm. It took ages to just get our table cleaned, to get the menu...no utensils given until we asked.....TWICE. So much time wasted. 

Had the Vegetable Don. It was so bland I could've made it myself. So I packed it and added my own unagi sauce at home which made it more tolerable. We also had the Gonoe rolls, which was about average. 

We won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Overpriced food!!  The place was empty when we got there...zero waiting on a weekend evening!!  We ended up eating again next door @ the buffet place!"}
{"text":"Been seated for 20 minutes, waiter still hasnt arrived. If I wasnt with 3 other ppl would leave right now."}
{"text":"To summarize...

FOOD 
- Absolutely delicious. Not sure if I was just extremely hungry this day, but the sushi rolls that we ordered were incredible. I specifically enjoyed the \"Las Vegas\" roll. Their menu is good because there is lots of variety, and the prices are fair. There were tons of yummy sounding special rolls, and it was also nice of them to give us extra spicy mayo on the side (without charge). The only complaint I have about the food is that it was slightly on the messy side in terms of how the chefs made it. 

DECOR/ATMOSPHERE 
- Old style Japanese wood decor
- They had private booths as well (with curtains) but those looked scary...
- Small space, but it's bearable 

SERVICE
- SLOW. I went on a weekday night, and the service was surprisingly irritating. Our server was friendly, but our food took forever. It also took ages for her to come over to take our order as well. That night wasn't empty but it wasn't very busy either, so I expected a bit quicker service. 

Overall I give this place 4 because of the delicious food, and the friendly staff. I just wished they worked at a faster pace... Lol"}
{"text":"Three of us came here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Sunday afternoon. I've had takeout from here before, so I somewhat knew to expect some good quality sushi.

We walked in and were greeted right away. Three of the four booths were taken, so we were luckily seated in the last one. We knew what we wanted right away based on looking at the menu before coming and looking at Yelp pictures. We decided to order the medium sushi and sashimi boat, 2 miso soups, a small hot sake and a shrimp+veggie tempura appetizer. 

We informed our waitress that we were there for a birthday, so she brought us a bit of edamame and three tiny noodle soups on the house. The boat was quite large and was beautifully arranged. The fish tasted great! We were checked on regularly and always had our teacups filled.

Overall, we had a great time. The food and service was excellent. I will definitely come back here if I am in the area and craving sushi!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but shitty service. No one here and seems like the servers would rather chat than provide service. Sat us in rooms and would have to go out and walk out ask them for service or they just stand there and chat."}
{"text":"Gonoe Sushi has recently replaced the other sushi spot in this little strip, so with intentions of going to the old place, we ended up here instead. 

This was pretty much an average sushi experience, with prices a bit high in my opinion.The meal started with complementary noodle soup, with crunchy tempura bits - YUM! It was really good and had me thinking we had ended up somewhere special (which turned out not to be the case).  I had ordered the \"Maki Combo 2\" - a spicy salmon and a dynamite. Both of these were pretty average, but priced at $15.99, I could have used something a bit more special! I also tried a few of my friends vegetarian rolls, which were delicious and quite reasonably priced. My meal came with miso soup and salad, the salad was your typical sushi joint salad, and the miso soup was a little weird - it just didn't quite have the perfect flavor to me. 

While the service was decent, it also was nothing special - it was kind of difficult to get the waitresses attention, and while she did stop by a few times, I could have used more frequent visits (I need water refills!!) - hence the 3 star review. 

So yes. If you're in the area in you need sushi, there is no harm in coming here - but if you're going out of your way for sushi, there are much better places at a similar or lower price point."}
{"text":"I stopped in late on this restaurant one night on the hunt for uni sushi and I was not disappointed. It was delicious, fresh and flavourful. Will have to visit again so I can write a more complete review. Place was small, but I was definitely impressed by the quality with just tasting one of their rolls and the uni sushi."}
{"text":"Very ordinary Japanese food! Not sure why it's 4 star! Have had better! Only came here coz was in the area and decided to try it since it had a 4 star Yelp rating! Should have gone to Tako!

Their specialty rolls r tiny in comparison to Mine sushi! 
Had the Beef teriyaki lunch set which was alright! Nothing to rave about! It came with 4 sushi&california rolls, and the set came in a bento box! The Korean style pancake it came with, wish that was hot and not cold like it was just taken out of the fridge! 

The lady was sweet, have my sis comp miso soup even tho she only ordered specialty roll!

Doubt I will come back again coz there are wayyyy too many Japanese to choose from!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and very fresh. They also have gluten free soy sauce for those that need it!"}
{"text":"Ok I am giving this place a coveted 5 star rating. 1. Great location. 2. Mondern hip decor. 3. Excellent service. 4. Very fresh Sashimi :) I actually came across this place by accident because another place we wanted to visit in the area was not open until 3pm on Sunday.
If you are looking a Sushi place that offers fresh food and great service you will find it here.
It is a smaller place, but definitely one of the best Sushi places I have been to downtown :)"}
{"text":"Hmm. Too much selection around gta but not familiar with this area. Comparing to places around Richmond Hill this place is just barely average. The crispy stuff in the rolls had some hard stuff in it where I would assume it's really old crispy stuff. Had some nice selections but I think even gal sushi is better.

Just FYI this place is korean owned as it seems. Nothing wrong with that though just wanted to put it out there."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch last week on yet another rainy day in Toronto. Despite the fact that it was busy, we got our food quickly. I got the kalbi lunch. The flavour of the ribs was good, but I found them a bit too fatty. My mom ordered a maki lunch and I had some. I have to say, it was very fresh and flavourful. Next time, I'd go with that instead. All in all, it was a good lunch and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"We came on July 1st and were seated within 10 min. Mind you, it was in the evening and there was a big lineup of people who wanted to have some sushi just before the fireworks.

The staff was friendly and prompt to the best of their ability. They were obviously understaffed that evening.

As to the food....well, nothing special to report back. Pretty standard fair in the price category they operate in. The maki were ok. Reasonably tasty. Would I come back here again? Probably not, but not because it was bad or anything, but because I'd want to experience a different restaurant.

If you're looking for a middle of the road kind of restaurant, then you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We, party of 4, came here for dinner. As I mentioned in the Hamaru Sushi review, the owner's younger brother owns this joint so I thought to check this place out.  A great decision and we really enjoy our experience here.  The owners were delightful, super nice, and gave us many free dishes. 

We ordered Medium Sushi Boat - Sushi & Sashimi, two orders of Seafood Udon, 4 orders of Spicy Salmon Hand Roll. 

The owner gave us 4 miso soup and salad to start, and said this is on the house.  Miso was hot and not too salty. Salad was fresh and the dressing goes really well with the vegetables. 

Then came the Spicy Salmon Hand Roll.  I'm a little sceptical at first because many AYCE sushi joint offer this so what makes this was stand out?  Well the salmon is fresh and it melts in your mouth. The seaweed is super crunchy and you know it is fresh, whereas the AYCE the seaweed is soggy at most places. 

Finally came the Sushi Boat. It looks stunning.  Looks like an art.  The owner gave us thick pieces of sashimi, therefore you can appreciate how fresh it is. Literally it melts in your mouth. Then to our surprise the owner offered us Shrimp Maki Roll for free and it was super delicious. Shrimp was cooked right, it was over cooked.

The owners then offered us 4 ice cream. Refreshing. It cleansed our palette. 

The overall theme of this joint is fresh, fresh, and fresh!  The bill came to $135 after tax. I gave 25% tip and we left this place satisfied.  Will definitely come back. 

Food:  5/5
Ambience:  4/5
Service:  5/5
Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"I find it funny that some feel the need to point out that Gonoe is Korean run. Who cares? It doesn't change the fact that the fish is always fresh, the service is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.

I live in the area and this is the only place I go to locally"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant on a road trip through eastern Canada in the summer of 2014. I'm originally from South Florida, so good sushi is definitely hard to come by. The ambiance of the restaurant is very chill, mainly due to the dim lighting (and they play K-pop, so if you're a fan like me, you'll enjoy it even more!). There are private booths available, which makes the restaurant even cozier. The only issue that I had with the environment would be some of the other customers. On the second visit, (my family and I loved this place so much that we actually came back twice on the same trip) there was a group of customers who were extremely rowdy. You can tell that they had been drinking because they were quite rude to the waitresses, and their speech was extremely slurred. 

The sushi and sashimi, however, is extremely fresh. Maybe my tastes and standards are a bit lower that Toronto locals, but I've never eaten sushi that was so fresh. We didn't bother to order any of the hot dishes because we really wanted to try as many sushi boats as possible. On our second visit, I guess some of the waitresses recognized us and without having to ask them, we were given complimentary side dishes. Because this restaurant is run by Koreans, the side dishes were, obviously, traditional Korean side dishes that you would find at any run-of-the-mill Korean restaurant. However, this was an extremely kind gesture, and the side dishes were all very tasty.

The only complaint that I have about the restaurant is the price. The sushi boat prices were a bit steep, and from what I can recall, we probably spent around $100-$150 for a family of 4. But because of the excellent customer service, we decided that it was worth the money to come back. If I ever get a chance to go back to Toronto, I will definitely re-visit Gonoe."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Saturday night. We were driving around the area and asked Yelp where to take us for some yummy Japanese and the reviews took us here. 
The place was reasonably busy but not packed, due to their location on Don Mills where most people are only there for work, or hang out a little south at Shops on Don Mills.

We were quite happy with their variety of food on the menu and free appetizers! They have an incredibly long list of rolls, which was what we were after. Their rolls range from $6 to $15 and there were probably five different types of \"Dragon Rolls\" which, after ordering three types, we were extremely satisfied.

Their free appetizers included a tiny bowl of warm soup noodle and edamame.
We ordered four rolls for the three of us to begin, and they were presented on a giant boat beautifully. We then ordered another two rolls, and they came on a plate, and then we were served sushi pizza for free. Needless to say we had to stuff ourselves to finish everything.

We had the legendary dragon roll, ultra dragon roll, crunch roll, yam roll, avocado and yam roll, another type of vegetarian roll. Every one of the rolls were fantastic.

6 rolls, 2 plum wine, and 1 beer was $30/person after tax and tip. It would have been much cheaper if we didn't over-order, but it was a happy uncomfortable full :P

Oh and the service is also awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a dinner after walking down lake shore. The line gets pretty long for dinner at the weekends as there's not a lot of space inside. Cute little space with some pretty good, affordable, and authentic Japanese. Had the tempura bento, teriyaki, and sushi. All tasted great. You can even see them prepare the sushi. There is a significant waiting time for the food and the servers so service could be improved upon."}
{"text":"Food was way too salty, from the miso soup to the salad all the way to the main dishes. In addition, the service was way too slow, we had to ask for the server to take our orders, and the roll that we ordered only came after we finished half of our food already."}
{"text":"Gonoe Sushi is relative small sushi restaurant compares to Tako Sushi next door. 

Though the exterior of the building is plain and minimalistic.. the interior deco is traditional and quite Asian... 

My friend was so excited that we got to sit inside those private booth...not that she is my Hot Date....and we are going to need some privacy? All we here today just for the Lunch Specials. 

Sashimi, Sushi and Roll ($13.95) 
- Nicely presented and made my friend went wow!! I guess Gonoe Sushi is a good place to impress your friend?? 
- Great selections of fish..and everything was nicely done.. 

Tempura and Beef Teriyaki Combo ($12.95) 
- A little disappointed..as the beef was really dry and the teriyaki sauce was not too good 
- Tempura was not bad: batter was light and just a tad oily since it was cold by the time it was served 

The Verdict: As the name implied, Gonoe Sushi, stuck with sushi, sashimi or rolls... avoid the cooked food.. and you won't be disappointed. 

Services here were polite and efficient.. Gonoe Sushi definitely a good place for lunch!!"}
{"text":"The good:

The ambience is quaint, relaxed and friendly.
The service is attentive.
The food is nicely prepared and presented.


The bad:
The sushi is good. Not great. But this is Toronto after all and we are geographically handicapped. 

The ugly:
Nothing."}
{"text":"Gonoe is a really nice sushi place with standard menus and prices. The owners are Korean. We ordered the sushi boat small, agedashi tofu, gyoza, and tempura udon. The boat had very standard sushi and sashimi, it would be great if there would be more variety to differentiate from other places. Their agedashi tofu was amazing though, it was a big proportion and the texture was very soft. The tempura was great but the soup base lacked a bit taste and the noodles were a bit hard. 

There was no complimentary soup or salad, but they did give out grilled salmon steak which is nice. In the beginning they also give you a small bowl of soup noodles (enough for a bite) as a starter. Waiters are very responsive and food came out very quick. Our teas were always kept full. This is a place guaranteed to have fresh sushi/sashimi each time!"}
{"text":"We came here because of the good reviews on yelp. We got the takoyaki and the mackerel to start and both were pretty disappointing. The takoyaki was overly rubbery and bland. The beef donburi was pretty bland as well. We thought the night would be saved by the sushi but it didn't quite pull it off. The kalbi roll was very.. chewy. The legend roll and flying dragon roll tasted alright but they used very thin slivers of sushi. The one good dish was the spicy salmon roll. At least the service was good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever eaten in the world!!! Very flavorful tempura, savory soups, and excellent sushi. If I can give more stars I would. Bring your significant others here, they will surely enjoy it."}
{"text":"The restaurant provides a cozy quiet environment. The servers are very nice - this would be a great date night idea. Takeout and delivery is offered and it takes around 10 minutes to prepare. 

I tried their salmon teriyaki and bulgogi and liked the Korean/Japanese fusion. However the salmon was overgrilled and thus taste burnt. The bulgogi tasted good and is quite comparable to other Japanese restaurants. 
Based on the quality of the food, I do think the price is slightly overpriced. I do want to try their sushi/sashimi dishes."}
{"text":"Yay my first review goes to Gonoe Sushi! This place is a family favourite due to its location (which includes lots of parking spots) and quality of sushi.

Food - 4/5
For our dinner of 4 we had the medium sushi and sashimi boat (60 pcs), beef combination dinner and a black dragon roll.  The boat is my go to dish as the sashimi tastes fresh and there is a wide assortment.  I definitely recommend the black dragon roll if you're into unagi.  It had the right amount of rice to filling ratio. The beef combination was just ok as the meat quality wasn't the best,  Come here for fresh fish, cooked foods might be better elsewhere. 

Service - 4/5
They have booths to the side which are private but I find that service is usually slower if you opt for those seats.  There were 2 waitresses working the packed restaurant so service wasn't the most efficient but my table was ok since we weren't in a rush."}
{"text":"Nice food, good presentation and good service. Will definitely go again. We were trying sushi first time in Toronto. Loved the flavors and staff recommended maki rolls."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was terrible. There was only one lady working 10 tables and answering phones for pickup orders. She was very friendly though but still, it was super slow. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great friendly quiet place with great food. Sat at the bar and was able to watch the Chiefs work. Food was as good as I have had before, very tasty with a number of small extras. Fried veggies were really good and the fish was fresh. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Love it here. The quality is amazing and the maki rolls are so flavourful. They don't wrap crazy amounts of rice to the rolls and they've always got the best selection of fish and raw items."}
