{"text":"Had Think burger with fries and Green flash IPA.  Hummus for app was good but little plain"}
{"text":"Great view, but it was lousy last time I was there. 

Beer in a chipped, cracked glass; hope I didn't drink that shard. Nachos covered In white gravy w/ extra jalapeños when we asked for *no* jalapeños. $12 = 22 nacho chips. $8 cider. No soap in either restroom; soiled Men's room sink area.

Keep it classy, OTB."}
{"text":"went there on a sunday afternoon around 3 and we were told there was an hour wait but there was easily 7 tables open inside and 2-3 open outside. are they trying to dissuade ppl from going there??"}
{"text":"The view here is GREAT!  you really can't beat the view or atmosphere.  I love that it's great for kids who are hard to entertain during dinner or its a great place to have dinner and drinks with friends.  The food is always good.  However every time we have been there it has been disorganized.  The one time we waited for our table at the playground near by only to find out an hour later their text messaging system wasn't working.  We also tried to get food to go one night and they said they weren't doing food to go that night- which tells me they don't really want my business and they don't really have a set of \"rules\" ie on Friday nights we don't do take out orders.  I always get the feeling the staff don't know what is going on, ie lots of open tables and no idea where to seat us?!"}
{"text":"Always regret going here.  The serve overpriced bar food and the service is terrible.  After you check in with no wait, you have to wait in line to check in.  The entire process is haphazard at best and malicious at worst."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but unfortunately when my friends and I had lunch there today our experience was less than enjoyable. First, I'm not sure why my two friends and I had to wait to be seated when we got there. There was one table sitting inside and 2 or 3 outside, and we had asked for inside. Second, the server's attire is actually appaling. It looks like they just got out of bed, and that's not an exaggeration they literally wear pajamas. But not every single one was so it was very odd and unprofessional. So fast forward we ordered food and were waiting, when the power goes out. Believe me I know this is out of any of the employee's control, however how they handled the situation was. After receiving two of our meals, we were told the 3rd one, a panini, was on its way out. After a few minutes our server came over and informed us the grill wasn't hot enough to finish the panini but he wouldn't make us pay for it. He didn't offer to get my friend anything else, he just said if we were still there by the time the power came back on they could start another panini for him. In the beginning of the meal we had actually planned on getting dessert but obviously we did not after our experience. I'm sorry to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for some drinks on a Friday after work and it was a great atmosphere with great drink prices.  It had just stopped raining and the employees quickly wiped off chairs outside for us. Everyone was friendly and the drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"Went last week.  Lights and decor set a festive yet laid back and somewhat rustic atmosphere inside during the winter months, and they have their own specialty cocktails to warm you up as well as cocoa for kiddos.  Its not a dive and there's no smoking inside but you can still get a fairly priced PBR if you want. They have sweet propane heaters that give off a nice cozy vibe and also help keep you warm in the dead of winter.  If it's not super cold they also have a fire pit on the patio which they'll turn on if you want...might be nice after some sledding, ice fishing etc.  

Staff is friendly, fun, and knowledgeable and are always happy to recommend the perfect drink for you!  

Several craft beers/IPAs, and ciders on tap and a ton of bottles to chose from.  

Great if you're in the north hills and not looking to drive far.  They do close around 10 though because they're in the park so might be a good starting place if you're planning on being out late.

Food menu isn't traditional bar food and consists of wraps, ridiculously huge specialty burgers, salads, flat bread sandwiches, but you can still get a pretzel and cheese etc if that's what you're in the mood for.  It'd be nice to see some healthier options besides just salads though as well as some more creative options for people looking to try new things. One of my favorite things is their black bean cake app which comes with habanero pineapple (with fresh cilantro) salsa.  They also locally source what they can if you're into supporting that.

This is an especially popular spot for summer as well with the outdoor patio by the lake.  There can often be long waits and they are extremely busy then which might be the cause of the service complaints in reviews. If you'd like to skip a wait etc. go in the winter months (best kept secret)!"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5

Good burgers. Were done well despite being ordered medium, though.

Atmosphere: 4/5

Lake view is awesome.

Service: 0/5

Despite using NoWait app ahead, waited 30 minutes upon arrival. Eventually sat at table that had been empty almost 20 minutes.

Cost: 3/5

Average."}
{"text":"Always good.  Winter menu (with nachos) a little stronger than summer.  Burgers are great and pretzels are a must.  Beer?  Great selection!"}
{"text":"Never had ate there before. Surprisingly the menu wasn't huge but had many things I saw that looked good. I got the bmx burger and fries. It was amazing. Cooked to perfection. Food came out incorrect but apparently there was a new cook and the waitress immediately fixed the problem. Would def go back again."}
{"text":"Cool joint and great atmosphere. The beer's cold and the food is good enuff.  Been here a number of times and the 
waitstaff never seem too anxious to pay attention to you and you have to get their attention to pay.  Awesome place for a patient patron.  A little bit of a challenge for the hungry or thirsty"}
{"text":"The burgers and beer selections are always great! The nachos there are really awesome. But I do have to say that I'm not a fan that you have to pay an extra $1 for fries and the chips that come automatically with the meal at no charge are always over done. But it's worth being able to sit overlooking the water. We will always go there!"}
{"text":"Nice place to come in the summer the patio is right by the lake and has a gas fireplace to keep warm in the evening. Love \"the tandem\" and great salads to choose from!"}
{"text":"Cool place however I have had some of the worst service in my three dinners there.   They appear to be very unorganized and untrained.   In fact, i am writing this from another restaurant after we waited 45 min ( open tables everywhere) and when we were seated we waited for 20 minutes for a server and then left.   Everytime i have been there it seems as though it is they just opened.

I will not go there again and if you have ever been there you know exactly what i am talking about.   Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely wonderful! The set-up of this place is so modern and so beautiful. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars, but sadly I can't. The view is wonderful, which i think is why so many people love it there and you see so many 5 stars. However, the menu is small and just a touch over priced, but again you are paying for the view. Same applies to drink prices. The real disappointment is in the terrible service, the servers are polite, but oh so slow, and more interested in hanging out on a lake then doing their job."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful for I have lived and grew up in the area. However, i was not impressed with the service or food. My friends and I were not greeted right away by the hostess. Once we finally got seated, at a dirty table, it took our waitress about 10 minutes before she came to our table and took our order. Our burgers were over cooked and the buns burnt. When we sent our food back we could hear the kitchen staff being completely unprofessional and rude because we sent our food back. It returned still not to our liking.  I asked to see the manager and while we watched our waitress approach her, the manager rolled her eyes. They really need to think about customer service and how to run a restaurant. I can say that we probably will never return and we can enjoy the lake in other ways. The only way this restaurant will stay in business is because of its location and definitely not because of its food or service."}
{"text":"Under experienced and under staffed. Food was average, bar was expensive. Waited 45 min to be seated, went to the bar and waited 20 min for a beer. Service was no better at the table. Very long wait for food. 3rd time there. Thought it was new and took time to get it together. I won`t return again"}
{"text":"So... Lots to love, lots to hate. As with other reviewers, I agree that the concept is great, but the execution is horrible. I think they grossly underestimated how popular this place would be. The kitchen just isn't the right size for the demand for food. This is why people have to wait so long for tables, even when several are open. They just can't keep up with the demand. 

Food... It's generally pretty good. We've had a few hiccups, but nothing that hasn't happened elsewhere. 

We are beer drinkers, so we really like the draft and bottled beer selection. The bartenders are knowledgeable about the beers (the table servers, less so). 

Atmosphere... Can't be beat. The outside patio in summer is THE place to be. Adirondack chairs invite you to sit and chill out while you enjoy the view of the lake, while the kayaks, canoes, paddle boards, and the occasional pedal boat come and go at the rental place right next door. 

Bathrooms... TERRIBLE. This is the reason for the 2 rating. The women's restroom always smells like raw sewage, and the paper towel dispensers are rarely filled. Instead, they just set a roll out on the counter, which results in one or both edges being saturated from sitting in water. To make matters worse, the bathroom serves park goers as well as restaurant patrons, and has a door that opens to the outside. This is a sexual assault waiting to happen. 

On our last visit, I went I to the bathroom at the same time as a server. She did not wash her hands after using the bathroom. 

In conclusion... I REALLY want this place to get its act together. I'm just not sure they can overcome the negatives."}
{"text":"The worst service of any place in the North Hills a bartender who couldn't make a martini waitresses letting you wait food mediocre"}
{"text":"This is a really great place to come for a good burger or sandwich, good beer and fun atmosphere. The setting is great-why didn't someone do this at the North Park Boathouse eons ago??? Prepare to wait if you want to sit outside, but there's a small bar where you can hang out. The burgers are good, the sammies are good....everything is good. Fun place. New favorite weekend lunch spot."}
{"text":"First time at OTB North Park. We love OTB in Southside, so we made a special trip to check out the new location. Great atmosphere! Gorgeous lake view seating for lunch or dinner. Perfect for any occasion. Food was delicious. Great selection of pumpkin beers (after all, it IS fall!) Service was great. Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  If you go on a nice day and get to sit outside, the view cannot be beat!  All of the food we have ever tried there has been amazing, but the burger with peanut butter on it was the best burger we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with my husband.  We had a great time! It was happy hour and burger night so our bill was very reasonable.  We split the heaven on earth burger and it was great! They even put it on two separate plates and the presentation was beautiful.  We got fries and slaw with the burger, the fries were amazing, the slaw was pretty bland.  Our beers were delicious and our server was friendly and very attentive.  
It was a great night!"}
{"text":"The view was great. Ducks, kayakers. Very relaxed and upbeat atmosphere.

Truly Stellar service.

Took kids to dinner there after kayaking. We were Dodos and forgot to mention the nut-sesame allergies till after we put in the order. Had called ahead and the staff had spoken to the kitchen and felt they could definitely handle this type of allergy. The server (T.C.-a gentleman) said that the burger was on the way out but they would remake the burger just to be absolutely sure there was minimal chance of contamination. No guarantees of course, as there can always be an accident, but to the best of their ability they wanted to make sure we had a safe meal.

Just Wow. If everyone were as careful and considerate as this Gentleman Server, the world would just be a Million times better!!!

Had the Fish tacos with chips, which were quite good. The aioli has a serious kick to it. It's interesting food. (Unfortunately, part of the soft tortilla was a little hard.)

Kids had burger (they were not sure about the allergen content of the bun but were sure about the burger and fries being OK) and mini-corn dogs. The kids were both pleased. The older child (8) does not hesitate to order off the adult menu (as in filet mignon medium rare if available) but liked the burger description. Does not hesitate to criticize food. He liked his burger and fries a lot. So that means something. The Kids meals came on/with a Frisbee. Which really made the kids happy! They already want to go back!



Definitely recommend! And we will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting! Awesome restoration of the old boat house. Great location for beers and a good meal. Large beer selection. Patio is huge and the inside is cozy- beautiful woodwork. The food is delicious. Good sandwiches and wraps. Decent kids menu with healthy options. Staff worked very hard to make certain the large crowd was happy when kitchen was backed up due to high volume of people bc of excitement for opening. Great setting, delicious food, good beer and a smart staff are definitely the   Ingredients needed to run a successful business."}
{"text":"I love this local spot!  It has a fantastic view of the lake at North Park, and in good weather their outdoor seating has an amazing view while still keeping you cool with the overhead fans.  The food is fantastic! I have never had a bad meal here! The blt sandwich is one of my favorites! I would recommend this place to anyone.  The service is fast and friendly and the cycling decor is really interesting.  Wonderful local spot for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The View; Bicycle Times BLT; and Beer!  Wooohooo! That is as good as it gets!  Did I mention the view?  I am pretty sure that I figured out the meaning of life after the first sip of my frosted-brew on the patio.  The square root of pi came to me after my bite of the Bicycle Times BLT.  Next week, BREAKFAST and world peace."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great beer selection and awesome patio views. The food and service where sorely lacking. It took an hour from the time I ordered for my hamburger to arrive at my table. Waitress managed to disappear for most of that hr and offered no explanation or apology for the delay. Eleven dollar a la carte hamburger was well done and dry as a boot when it finally arrived(ordered medium). Check was wrong to add insult to injury. I would definitely go again...but I would make sure I ate before I went."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to North Park. It's an awesome spot for for a bite after a run or bike ride or paddleboarding. 

They a have nice selection of sandwiched and salads. Last time I was there I had the zucchini appetizer. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have given this place a shot 4-5 times and i think its because i want it to be my spot and I anticipate improvement, given that they haven't been open that long.  I frequent the park, I am an avid biker and runner and this place could be AWESOME.  Unfortunately, it has not lived up to expectations.  Every time we try this place, some new problem comes up. Whether its a long wait (1-2 hours), servers being over worked and not attentive, receiving our apps before our drinks (water and tea) or having an issue with the food (although usually pretty consistent), there is always something!  It actually is really confusing to me why the wait is so long but there are 4-5 tables available!!! My guess is the kitchen gets backed up and they stop seating people or the servers already have 5-7 tables each.  

With a well trained, experienced, appropriately staffed staff, I could see this place flourishing regardless of the average food.  However, the bartenders are clearly stressed and don't seem to work efficiently, mostly because they aren't very knowledgeable of the beer (Good selection of drafts) and cocktails offered.  The servers and bus kids are not on the same page and the hostesses are having trouble managing the large amount of tables.  

This is a great location and I will likely continue to give this place a shot, however, in the future it will likely be on nights when a don't have any other commitments and won't be annoyed at the long wait for a table or food.  

My recommendation would be to stop in for beers at the bar and find a spot to stand or sit on the patio while you wait for a table.  Typically there is a picnic table on the back patio that doesn't seem to be used for dinning."}
{"text":"Overall great place.  The views outside are amazing.  The service is great, so is the rotating tap beer selection.  There is also an ample bottle selection.  Only complaint is too many IPA's and not enough wheat on tap in summer (but great wheat beer selection in bottles/cans). The food is above-average. Great place to come after a run at north park."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great view and I can't wait until summer to sit outside.  There is a wait at times but its well worth it.  Staff is friendly and food is Basic and good."}
{"text":"I went here with an enormous amount of people for a rehearsal dinner and I was very impressed with the service and the food.  We had 1 waitress for about 27 people and she had her A game out and she wasn't messing around.  Everyone's drink orders and food orders were correct and the food was delicious.  They have a pretty good beer list, too.  Everything is fairly priced too.  I would definitely go here again and I would want to bring out of town guests here too.  The inside and outside look really cool.  We sat out on the deck area and we had an excellent view of the lake as the sun went down."}
{"text":"I look forward to amending this review after OTB has time to mature (and the hype dies down).  Meaning, OTB has potential.  But, right now, they're still finding their groove.  I've been there twice.  The place is small and crowded.  The service is spotty and the food inconsistent.  The patio is a great setting for group gatherings and having a drink.  The bar selection is very good.  All in all, I look forward to improvement.  Right now, it's just average."}
{"text":"Saw several negative reviews and just had to add a positive one. We arrived at peak lunch time; were told our wait would be 10-15 minutes. Sat down in the loungey red chairs only to be called to our table in four minutes. The wait staff and food runners were all polite and attentive. Our appetizer and sandwiches were delicious and decently priced (I think my cheese and veggie panini was $7?) and came out rather promptly even with the crowd. The ambiance and view were lovely. What's not to like? It's not very close to home, but we'll definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service were great! Fun menu options and great draft selection. Brittany was amazing and really helpful. Would highly recommend Over the Bar!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, if we are all honest, the only reason this place is in business is the old adage of location, location, location.  Despite being the land of 3 rivers, Pittsburgh does not do a good job of using its water for dining and drinking.  OTB gets that right.  Great location on North Park Lake with outdoor seating and casual outdoor seats to drink at as well.  The bar menu is very good.  Good selection of draft beers, bottles and cans and cocktails.  They even have an \"on deck\" circle to tell you what beers are next in the draft rotation.  Really good place to grab a drink and socialize, especially when the weather is good.

The food on the other hand is a different story.  It is not awful by any means but the nicest thing I can say about it is that it is edible.  I have been there 4 times (wanted to give it a decent shot before posting a review).  Once for breakfast, twice for lunch and once for dinner.  All four times the meals are \"Meh\".  Things that are supposed to be hot are cold (like coffee and french fries).  All burgers seemed to be cooked the same way despite how people order them.  Buns are not fresh (or just not very good).  Food descriptions are great on the menu and the staff is usually pretty good at helping you navigate the menu, the issue is it is just not that good.  And don't get me started on the wait times and the useless No Wait app they have.  Do yourself a favor and meet some friends there for a drink or even happy hour but go somewhere else for a good meal."}
{"text":"The beer selection, food and view are amazing. The service on the other hand is extremely lacking. I had ordered a Great Lakes IPA and was told they were out. Ok no problem. Except when I got up to use the bathroom, there was an entire fridge full of it. I went back and asked the waitress and again she told me they were out until I told her I saw the fridge. There have been multiple times I have waited for a table and saw 4-5 empty, unbussed tables. Other than the poor service by the wait staff it's been excellent every time. Also it seems like it's more the wait staff and not the bartenders. Anytime I've ordered in the bar area it's been great."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great!! I'm always glad to support good people doing great things. the owner mike had a great concept  found the right people and made it happen, good for yinz! Perfect for a beer after a summer ride, and great grub!! thanks for your hospitality mike!! your pal at ICB"}
{"text":"I was with a group of 9 kayakers. Today is Wednesday and it wasn't busy at all. I sat at the biggest table available. As the rest of my party arrived the bartender would not let them come and sit down. She said that all people had to be present before we were allowed to sit. Terrible customer service. We had to stand until the last person arrived. Half of their tables were empty. Our group was tired and hungry. What is wrong with today's young people???? They act like they haven't got a brain in their head. They were basically disrespectful and arrogant spouting stupid rules. I had ordered fries when I arrived first. Through this entire ordeal the bartender never gave me my fries that sat at the end of the bar. She gave them to me when they were officially cold. I gave them back. Horrible service, disrespectful workers. Never again."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for lunch today with my parents. I happened to have a bogo coupon from the Enjoy book that just came out. 

Our visit started out on a good note, cool place on the lake and the hostess was friendly. However, the bartender was very rude, as was our waitress. When I gave her the coupon, she immediately said \"we don't accept these, they are only for the SouthSide location.\" I showed her it clearly listed both locations. She then snapped, \"well it's expired.\" Once again I showed her it didn't expire until nov. 2014. My mom joked, \"wow you really don't want to give this to us, huh?\" To which she replied, \"no,\" 100% serious. Unbelievable! She then read aloud to us the statement on the coupon about tipping your server based on the total before the coupon. It was so insulting it wasn't even funny.

The food sucked. I don't know how you mess up a BLT, but they managed to. Fish tacos were bad too. I think this place could be nice for just drinks, especially when it's warm and you can sit on the deck. Otherwise, do not recommend."}
{"text":"The best place to enjoy a drink in the summer with a beautiful view of north park lake! Can't forget to mention THE DIRT RAG DELIGHT- an excellent burger with unique toppings. They've also got a great selection of local craft brews. If you're not a burger fan, try their black bean appetizer. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. The food is pretty good, the ambiance on the lake is nice, they have pretty good beer selection. However, the service is beyond horrible. I have eaten here several times and each time the service was bad. They would not cook the food correctly, forget stuff, and your wait time is ri-fucking-diculous. If you have hours of free time to wait for your order to come out correctly, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for us and we were so excited to see the return of weekend brunch! So disappointed that our favorite brunch item, the Stack, was NOT ON THE MENU!!!! What the heck OTB? #bringbackthestack"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent here often because of the location. The patio is perfect for a warm day. The decorations are cute and it's probably one of the nicest patios in the area. This place is always packed on a nice day so make sure to use the no wait app! 

The food here is very underwhelming. I normally order the Rachel Carson wrap and it has a sad piece of lettuce on it and a small portion of chicken compared to pita ratio but it is better then most things I've had here. I do enjoy the hand cut chips that come with the wrap though! 

Service here is nothing special either. Hostesses are awkward and not welcoming. Servers always seem to be overwhelmed and none of them are very personal or go out of their way to be friendly. All in all if you're looking for a nice place to hang out on a warm day, OTB is perfect. Just don't expect outstanding food or service!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and good beer! Their fries are so amazing. I got the burger with peanut butter on it, added bacon and omg it was amazing! I got the Narwhal IPA and it was delicious and refreshing. Our waiter Kurt was really attentive and great! If I lived in Pittsburgh I would come here all the time! Beautiful lake views and the patios have standing heaters which is nice."}
{"text":"Wife and I had our 1st meal here.  We were seated instantly, our server was quick and courteous, our burgers were both enjoyed (the 'Dirt Rag' with peanut butter on it was excellent)."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to be seated party of 5, had a six top broken and were asked to sit at a four top. The party included 5 adults. We were told we couldn't have two tables together even though they had another party at a six top. Their solution was for us to wait there for a booth. They seated the two parties behind us that had been waiting ten min. Then again offered us a four top table. The bar staff has always been wonderful, it is simply the restaurant portion that is lacking. 

This is the fourth time I have been with really poor service. It's a neat location, but I will not be returning due to the customer service issues."}
{"text":"First download NoWait app.  We drove around the parking lot for 15 minutes looking for parking.  There were 11 people ahead of us. 

It is a beautiful setting.  Nice evening.  Got to watch the paddle boarders and kayak people on the lake.

We sat outside.  Light breeze no mosquitoes (surprisingly). 

Generous and frequent refills.  We both ordered the fish sandwich.  It was ok.  The coleslaw was ok.  The chips were good.  

The majority of the menu is sandwiches.  It was nice to see local vendors (Cop Out periogies) used.

The venue is the selling point.  It is a nice place to enjoy the view ... and maybe catch a glimpse of Henry the Heron."}
{"text":"So the food was very good. I really enjoyed the dirt rag burger. The down side is the check-in process. Supposedly walk ups were 30 minute wait. So we used the No Wait app and checked in on our drive there. 20 minutes later we arrive and tell hostess we used No Wait and we are here. She said ok there are 2 parties in front of you. So we wait. We watch 4 parties get seated before us????? After 30 minutes waiting at the restaurant we ask what's up. They said oh you have 2 parties in front of you still???? We question why the wait despite checking in online 50 minutes ago. No clear answer, she talks about how it's hard to judge wait times, etc. I should mention this all occurred at 3pm, not exactly prime mealtime.
Finally got seated. Waited about 10 minutes for someone to greet us and take drink orders. Waitress was nice and apologized for the wait. Food was a bit slow but was very delicious."}
{"text":"We love it here. The food has been good and there are lots of vegetarian options. Love the patio overlooking the lake, great to sit in the Adorondacks and have a beer. The bathrooms are atrocious though and it would be great if they'd fix that."}
{"text":"good view, average taste of food and terrible service! they need to work on customer relations instead of giving bad attitude just say sorry!"}
{"text":"I always enjoying going to the boathouse for lunch. When the patio area is open and you can sit outside by the lake, it's awesome.

I ordered the salmon salad and I went with the ginger peanut vinaigrette and have been dreaming about the dressing ever since. One of the best salads I've had in a lot time. 

They are a great restaurant for brunch as well and the service has always been great! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am going to be generous and give this a 3 star because the location is amazing and I wanted so badly to like my meal here.  We used the NoWait app and put our name in 45 minutes before we wanted to be seated and still had to wait for over a half hour after this.  After over an hour wait we were finally seated-I get that it was a busy Sunday afternoon on a beautiful day but really! Next it took our party of 6 over 45 minutes to get our meal. It was nice to enjoy the view of the lake outside on the deck but we were melting by the time our meal came.  I was hoping for Sunday brunch but I guess they stop the breakfast menu at 11-geeze they really cater to those early morning bikers.  I went with the BLT which also came with avocado and a fried egg. It was very tasty and I do like that you were able to pick your choice of a side, I went with the fruit which was just ok.  The prices were high but I guess you are paying for the view.  I want to give this place another chance and go back for happy hour as they have great specials!"}
{"text":"Although I'm typically at the park 2-3x/week I've only been to the boathouse dining a handful of times. I usually opt for a beer (they have a good selection) and a burger which has never disappointed. Usually you either have good food or a good view and here you definitely have the best of both worlds. More upscale bar food with a relaxing setting watching the kayakers on the lake. This is quickly becoming a staple restaurant for when you want to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Great lunch at the Boathouse. Two had mushroom soup and fries. I enjoyed the BLT. Generous portions. Great tasting. Hot. Good service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by a little after 12 and we were seated immediately. I had the pedal panini without peppers. Very good! I picked the coleslaw as a side. It was a little bland, but fresh. My daughter had the tandem grilled cheese with fries. She likes that it comes served on a frisbee. We sat on the enclosure which was heated. Perfect lunch date for us girls."}
{"text":"OTB at the boathouse is not my favorite place. I've been here twice now and both times been disappointed. Let me say that the restaurant itself is nice, especially in the summer and the back is open to the lake, however, the food here is nothing special. On my first visit, I tried the nachos and found them to be very spicy and because of my low spice tolerance, unable to eat them. From the menu description, I didn't think they were going to be spicy - but surprise! On my most recent visit, I has the cranberry ginger mule, which wasn't bad, but there was definitely something missing from the drink - I couldn't taste the ginger beer at all which was disappointing. On this visit, I also opted to try a burger, and I got the trail burger. I ordered a medium burger that came out well... not really ideal but I was so hungry from waiting I just decided to eat it. It wasn't bad, but after ~10minutes the inner crispy onions because to get soggy and my burger became pretty unappetizing. I'm giving OTB 3 stars because I would come back and try something else off the menu if friends wanted to go here, but by no means would I ever pick this place for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Meet some coworker for happy hour on a Friday and we had a blast, the staff was in a great mood and the beers where priced right. A great spot to just chill with some beers and food on lake at north park. I have also stopped in a few times for the post bike ride beer a few times, the crowd is always a good group and never stuffy."}
{"text":"A great experience ambience you name it.
The fish sandwich leaves  a lot to be desired. Too tin...where's the fish.
Work on it guys otherwise keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Absolutely gorgeous setting, beautiful place, fantastic food, good service, and very reasonable prices! HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to comment on the limited amount of customer service I received... the no wait app was not working for this restaurant so I called to try to make a reservation since I knew the wait was about an hour.. hostess told me to try no wait again so I tried it about 10 more times and it still said that the restaurant doesn't use no wait. I called three times to try to make a reservation since it was my 82 yr old grandmother's birthday, but the hostess told me she was too busy to help me and make my reservation! Can't believe the horrible customer service! I think if your app is not working you should accommodate customers! I was sad that I couldn't take my grandma there for her birthday because they would not or \"were too busy\" to take a reservation! It's a great location and restaurant, but please work on your customer service!!"}
{"text":"Our third and last attempt at liking OTB at the boathouse. The building, patio, and location by the lake are all great. That's truly all this place has.

Food: the nachos are over seasoned with a Doritos-like powder and cafe with a ladle of cheese sauce, and sprinkled beans and peppers. My wife got the fish tacos which were under seasoned, and the coleslaw has no flavor at all. I ordered a burger which was ok, but the fries were covered in another seasoning. It tastes like the cook destroyed their tastebuds years ago. I was going to leave this review before my wife and I both became sick after eating dinner here yesterday.

Service: the people are friendly but the timing is insane. We ordered the nachos with menus in hand, and they came three minutes later. When our server came to check on the nachos, we ordered our food which also arrived in a few minutes while the nachos were still on the table. We were literally through two courses in 25 minutes.

It's probably a great place to sit and have a drink by the lake, but after three underwhelming attempts at liking the food plus getting sick, I would advise anyone to try a better spot in the north hills."}
{"text":"Everything that has been said about the view and the service has been absolutely true. Most of the reviews have nailed the overwhelming beauty of the location and the underwhelming nature of the food.  So allow me to express a particular choice to avoid, what they call \"hummus\".   

It is understood that hummus comes in a wide variety of forms.  It can be smooth as silk or a little on the chunky side. It can be laced with lots of doodads like red pepper, olives or edamame   That's all fine. But the stuff they try to pass off here as hummus  isn't worth it unless your favorite version of hummus is a bland glob of semi-mashed chick peas,  In order to be hummus, there has to be a noticeable presence of three things in addition to chick peas, namely garlic, lemon and tahini.  This stuff was lacking all three.  I don't even think there was salt in it.  That's too bad, because the toasted pita wedges were actually very good.   

4 stars for the location. 2 for the food."}
{"text":"OTB is Underwhelming.

The stage is set for greatness, but falls short, unfortunately. Its a great outdoor spot that has a nice view & patio. But what it has in atmosphere it is totally lacking in what makes  a restaurant successful- good food and good employees.
Unfortunately the few times I have been there have all resembled one another- average food and not so great service. and on top of that the prices seem to be a little higher than you'd expect for a standard menu.

I keep going back because I like the outdoors option- but maybe next time I will stick with drinks only & some nachos."}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected at all, in a good way! The last time I walked by this place they were still closed and I kind of just pictured it as a little average cafe. I mean, can you blame me when the subtitle in their name is \"Bicycle Cafe\"? I've never been to the original OTB, either, so I didn't have an experience there to give me any expectations about this place.

So today when I walked in after kayaking I was surprised to find a very chill and welcoming dining area with music playing near the bar and a bustling patio. The menu impressed me, too; I tend to expect fried finger foods from park dining areas but instead I found a full burger and sandwich focused menu with lots of vegetarian-friendly options. And there were tons of healthy side dish options on the menu, too.

Given how busy the patio was my companion for the day and I opted to sit inside, which really wasn't a problem; the patio and indoors area aren't really separated by much more than a roof over your head, so we could enjoy a great breeze and were still far enough from the bar and speakers that the noise of the indoor area wasn't a problem.

And not only was the atmosphere great, the food was pretty delicious. I had a slightly spicy and perfectly cooked turkey burger with fruit salad on the side; I also shared the black bean patty cakes with my dining companion and I thought they were absolutely perfect. (My companion thought they could have been a little crispier, but not me!) They were so tasty, especially once I added the amounts of Pico De Gallo, pinapple, guacamole and sour cream that I wanted. I partnered a Raspberry Summer Tea (Raspberry vodka and lemonade) with my meal and have to say, combined it was all a fantastic way to round out a beautiful summer day by the lake.

My only true complaint is with the bathrooms - the cafe's attached to the public park bathrooms, and, well...the public park bathrooms are as horrendous as you might expect public park bathrooms to be. I couldn't get out of there fast enough and it's a shame that those bathrooms have to be affiliated with this place at all.

But other than that, no complaints whatsoever - great atmosphere, great service, tasty food, and a nice place to relax after walking or kayaking in the park. I'd absolutely eat here again the next time I'm enjoying the area!"}
{"text":"Dined here for the second time last night. The first experience was not good, horrible service, but the food was good and the outside atmosphere was worth another try! Table of 8, 6 adults, 2 kids. We were there for 2 hours. Nothing we ordered was time consuming, long ticket times. Unfortunately, had the same server, same service. Half the table was and/or still is in the service industry so we can be very understanding. Drinks weren't filled, drinks from the bar took far too long, and we were told bartender was MIA- not something you tell a table, if one person asked for something when we were checked on, no time was given for anyone else to ask, server rushed away. Nachos were horrible, barely touched, server didn't notice or ask if there was anything else we wanted. Asked for separate checks and server told us he had no idea who had what and we had to tell him. For someone who has worked in the industry for years and years, you don't tell your table that, try and figure it out, if any confusion ask for clarity. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"While the menu isn't Five Star dining, the execution of the dishes is excellent, the service is superb and the beer and drink list very nice. You can't get a better view in the North Hills. 

We will still be raving about the grilled broccolini we got instead of the standard chips or fries. It was perfectly cooked with little blackened crispy pieces and succulent long stems in a light salt & oil coating. Amazingly good! 

I also loved my Heavenly sandwich with a grilled chicken breast,  fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and sautéed spinach. The only problem with getting peppers & spinach on a brioche bun is the occasional soggy spot. It tasted unbelievably good. 

They have some good beers on tap. I checked out the North Country Brewing Blood Orange Sour beer and it went down nice and easy on this warm Summer day.

What terrific view of the boaters, kayakers, paddle boarders, and fishermen and women.  It's nice to see entire families out eating together too - young toddlers and elders mixing in with teens and everyone else between. We really enjoyed our time here and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great location, good view, a bit chilly this time of the year so bring a blanket or longer coat.  The food was good.  We started with the pierogi appetizer (get the additional bacon and sour cream) and then ended with burgers and panini.  Burgers were nicely grilled with extra toppings.  The fries were the best!  A bit spicy with seasoning salt and the fry was a good shape and size with a nice crispy crunch. Can't wait to return at our next Pittsburgh visit in the summer."}
{"text":"I arrived here in the greatest of moods- the sun was shining bright on the beautiful North Park Lake (their location), birds were chirping, and the weather was sublime.

I walked in to the classic boathouse where the restaurant is located, instantly charmed by the cyclist themed decor and placed our name in the digital wait list. I was told we would have an hour long wait... Ouch. 

No worries, my mood can't be ruined by that, so with the family we go on a stroll around the park and come walk back at the conclusion of our hour. 

The restaurant operates with this text message based system that notifies you when your table is ready (an additional app download is required.. 2.5/5 stars on the apple store to give an indication of quality), and ours hadn't notified us yet so I inquired at the front (with a flustered and confused teenaged hostess) and found out we had ANOTHER 20 minutes. 

An hour and twenty minutes for this... Yikes.

The staff made sure that these twenty minutes passed comfortably... By having us stand in a corner and stare at empty tables.

Starting to feel my merry disposition waver, we are seated, and after some spotty and unprofessional service (the hostesses weren't even wearing an \"Over the Bar\" T-Shirt, just some ratty random t-shirts) we see the menu.

\"They're charging this much for basic bar food?\" My father inquired.

Yes, yes they did charge us a good amount for the grub.

I'm glad to report that our waitress was very professional and understanding and that some of the food (got the guacamole, pico, turkey burger) was pretty good as well. (The pretzels however, were not- typical microwave fare)

I am not writing this to sound unnecessarily harsh, but I have had far superior dining experiences at my local McDonalds location.

Please, please do yourself the favor and steer clear of this mistake of a dinner. 

Attractive location and decor aside, this place offers nothing and will leave you infuriated- proving the age-old adage that appearances really aren't everything. 

2/5 save your time and money"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, but the good points stop there. Horrible service, lackluster food, presented with dirty dishes...I could go on but it would just infuriate me more."}
{"text":"Somewhat limited menu. Nothing fancy. But the items are well prepared. The service is good at the tables. Try getting a drink at the bar that's another issue. Plus if you want to sit outside  and wait for your table you need to go to the bar and order appetizers and beer or drinks and pay for it. It's usually three Deep at the bar.
Have a nice view of the lake but it's extremely noisy. I don't know why this place is so crowded the draw is obviously the view Because it can't be the overpriced food"}
{"text":"Hire more cooks!!! Cook faster!!! If you want to be seated at 7:00 you should sign in on the No Wait App at 5:00. I'm not kidding...expect a 2 hour wait to be seated and another 90 minutes to be served. Cook faster!!!"}
{"text":"New favorite place!! I love that you can eat on the water and they have so many food options - they all looked very tasty and customizable. 

I only subtract a star because it was kind of buggy (which I guess you get being on the lake...) and the waitress was a bit...awkward. I don't need you to be the friendliest person on the planet but at least smile if I say something nice? 

I want to come back and spend more time here. It's so cute!"}
{"text":"Short & simple: Food was great, view & atmosphere even better! Make sure you use the no wait app as they always seem to have waits."}
{"text":"Really great inside and outside atmosphere. The food is better than the average restaurant food, and the beer selection is on point. I really love the patio by the lake and if you have the No Wait app it makes getting a table super easy."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow.  Waitress forgot to bring us our drinks and then never checked back on us for refills.  Meal was ok.  Grilled cheese was tasteless and the tomato soup was ok.  

The only reason we return to this place is because of the atmosphere A+++ on the lake with a beautiful view and they are on the \"Nowait\" app so we don't have to wait.  Wouldn't go there for the food or service"}
{"text":"I visited OTB (Over the Bar Bicycle Cafe) at the North Park Boathouse last fall with family while B was mountain biking in the area. The location is absolutely beautiful! The building is gorgeous and sets on a very picturesque lake. It's a perfect spot to dine outdoors during nice weather.

OTB offers burgers, sandwiches, salads, and bar food. Plus they have a pretty good beer list. I didn't get to try much from the menu, as we had dinner plans coming up, but I did try the Peel-Out Pierogies, which were really tasty, and the North Ridge Nachos, which were pretty good. 

If you're checking out North Park, I think OTB is a great place to stop for a bite or a drink."}
{"text":"Meh.  The food is okay, it's really the location and the view you would come to OTB for.  Slightly pricey for the taste, I would probably only recommend this place if you wanted the view. I don't think it was that busy (maybe I'm wrong, maybe it was) but we had three servers try to bring us food that wasn't ours - THREE TIMES.  And this was after we'd been served.  If the food was good, it wouldn't have mattered, but it just seemed like the place was relying on their location to snag customers and not their food or service.  I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around! Friendly service, delicious food, and a view that cannot be beat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Location is great, food is ok....but the service is awful.  There is one manager who (blonde woman) who is really good, but the entire staff otherwise acts as if you are bothering them.  The rules for outdoor seating (in the lake-facing chairs) change daily...and if they would change the staff, it wouldn't be so bad.  They are inattentive, uninformed, and have the personality of a sorority girl who isn't sure that you're cool enough to pay attention to over her phone or worse, they act like they just got there 5 minutes ago - for the first time, and don't know what's going on.  The bartenders will stare at you, then through you, before they grumpily ask you what they have to get for you.  Once you set aside your fear and insecurities about bothering anyone, it's great. I've been there at least 10 times, and with almost every employee, it's the same sad thing...I hate to support the bad attitudes, but love the location...."}
{"text":"Great food at an amazing location. Don't let a great fall day go buy without stopping by.  I'm not a huge turkey burger fan but they are juicy here. Best around. Go ahead and kick back on the patio with a nice cold drink."}
{"text":"Have read a lot of sub-par reviews on here, and was very skeptical. Always thought the N Park boathouse was a beautiful building in need of a purpose. Decided to go on a Sunday afternoon just after 4, the hour between when they stop serving brunch and when they start dinner specials. What's up with that?

Not overly crowded at all, which I knew thanks to NoWait. Several tables taken outside, in spite of temps in the high 40s. I'll take my gorgeous view just inside the glass thank you, where there's still heat. Grace, our waitress, told us to ignore the draft menu since she had an updated list. I had a 21st Amendment Toaster Pastry IPA draft, my companion had a bottled Miller Light. Grace told me it might take a few minutes for my beer since they were just changing kegs (thanks for the heads up). 

I ordered a WheelMill burger, medium, my friend, the fish sandwich. Though the burger was definitely not medium, it was good and not overcooked shoeleather. My companion really liked her enormous fish sandwich, that included enough house-made chips to feed everyone.

It was a crisp, cloudless fall day, and the lake setting was spectacular. Sure it's bar food, but it doesn't pretend to be more. I can't agree with the many posts regarding bad service - Grace was gracious ;) - but can only relay my experience on this day. OTB is a nice place for good conversation., decent food and beverage, in a gorgeous setting."}
{"text":"The ambiance of OTB can't be beat.  The inside is a little edgy with its bicycle theme, gears and bike parts abundant.  Then you step outside and it is like you were transported to a Nicolas Sparks novel.  Large wooden loungers to enjoy the view and a brew. (See what I did there), or a nice umbrella covered table to enjoy your meal as you watch eager fisherman standing on the side of the lake.  We both had the Hot spicy chicken sandwich, which was just spicy enough and right out of the kitchen.  Get the chips, the coleslaw was average, but the chips are fantastic.  (Grab some ranch to dip)
As for attire, OTB is in the middle of North Park.  There is a lot of athlesuire.  I think it would be hard to be underdressed there.   Choose a beautiful day and go sit on the deck, get there early  because that is premium seating (as there are not many tables)"}
{"text":"awesome view/atmosphere with good food. Really great place when the weather is nice. Probably my favorite patio in the area."}
{"text":"I love the Boathouse! I have gone there for date night, ladies night and even for family lunches. The view is fantastic and when you sit down you just exhale and relax. In the cooler months there are outdoor heaters, so you can still be outside and be comfortable. The food and drinks are ok (not a full bar - they only have certain liquor but more than adequate). 3 stars because service can be very slow at times, and my bill has been wrong on more than one occasion and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a Voodoo Brewery beer pairing dinner. Atmosphere very nice. and the food was good too...........but of course the Voodoo brews were amazing. We started out with Jalapeno rockets that were stuffed with chicken and cheese and wrapped in bacon, (a bit too spicy for me) but the pariing of H2P softed the spicy blow. 2nd course was Mango Thai Shrimp Salad with Killa Pilz, this did not disappoint!
Entree was salmon with couscous and roasted brussel sprouts , i must say i make better roasted sprouts and the couscous was gummy, however the salmon was cooked to perfection. It was paired with White Magick of the Sun!  Dessert was lemon tart (very hard crust, had to cut it with a knife) which was delicious, paired with Big Black Voodoo Daddy which went very well together. I would go back to a beer pairing dinner here in a heartbeat. The brewer is well spoken and much fun to listen to!"}
{"text":"OTB in north park is well hidden if you don't know where to look, but I enjoyed finding it. The beer they have on tap is limited, but at least they have touchtunes so the music isn't all bad. There not to far from CCAC North Campus or La Roche College so it does benefit the college community. I didn't have the chance to sample there food so I can't really say I had the real OTB experience."}
{"text":"What a setting!  As far as views go, OTB at the Boathouse has beauty in spades.  I know people say this all the time but if I could go with 2.5 stars, I would.  But it's true; I have \"experienced better\" but this experience wasn't quite \"A-OK.\"  My group of 6 enlisted the help of the No Wait app at noon, hoping for a 12:30 seating.  According to the app, which I understood isn't a sure-thing, we were to expect a 30 minute wait.  Unfortunately, we were seated after 1pm and didn't receive our food until closer to 2pm with spotty drink service in between.  The location is nice enough that I'd give OTB another go at maybe a less-than-peak time of day.  Amongst the group we tried a Pittsburgh salad with seitan, a BLT, seitan wings, the \"Thick\" (a super-thick burger), chicken fingers and a caprese salad.  The comments ranged from \"not bad\" to \"decent\" without a lot of variety in between.  Decent bar food isn't a bad way to put it IMO.  But for the wait, I was really hoping for better than decent.  I might stick to picnic-ing in North Park instead..."}
{"text":"Decided to meet up with friends today for lunch here.  We have been training for the half marathon at North Park for the past month or two, so it was nice to come here to eat/drink instead of run.

Temperature was fairly mild and it was sunny, so we decided to sit outside.  The place was fairly crowded, but it was no problem getting a seat promptly.  They have indoor seating here and outdoor seating, plus a small bar on the inside.  The vibe here is extremely laid back, both on the inside and outside.  The outside seating is on a nice sized deck that overlooks the lake.

The staff here is quite friendly, fast and efficient.  No service complaints at all.  

They food here was pretty good.  They offer some appetizers, salads, burgers, wraps and sandwiches.  I had the Heaven on Earth burger (minus the bun and fries).  No complaints with it.  My wife went with the fish tacos and she really enjoyed them.  They have 10 craft beers on tap that crossed many styles (IPA, Pilsners, Red Ales, Belgian Whites).  They also have a fairly extensive beer bottle list that covers your standard macro beers but also have a nice selection of craft beers.

I was pleasantly surprised with my experience this time around (previous time here we just had a fairly quick beer) based on some of the reviews.  If you are looking for a nice place to sit outside and have a beer, I would definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Never had bad food or service. Lacks personality sometimes but overall a cool place. Breakfast was delicious and I normally like the turkey burger."}
{"text":"Talk about an amazing location for an outdoor themed cafe.  OTB at the Boathouse is run by the OTB (Over The Bar) Bicycle Cafe on the South Side.  I expected the same good food and great beer as the original OTB, and they delivered.  The view of the lake is stunning and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The food was great! The outdoor patio is so pleasant when the weather is nice- half the charm of the place is the view of the lake at North Park."}
{"text":"Enjoyed wonderful view and food today!  Fish tacos, burgers and salads recommended for lunch options."}
{"text":"Came here for a few beers after a work event. I was blown away with how gorgeous the view was from the patio. It was one of those days where the weather was perfect and sitting there while having a few beers just made it a wonderful day. The service was awesome and the beer selection was great. I definitely want to come back here soon!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was unbearably bad. Staff were disinterested at best and rude at worst. We waited 45 minutes for a table only to be seated outside under a heater. After 5 minutes the heater went out. We asked our waitress to turn it back on and she didn't come back for 15 minutes and even then her answer was \"Oh I don't know I told them about it.\" The table next to us was so cold they just left. (Our appetizers, the pretzel and zucchini rolls, are already cold at this point.) Another server came by and we asked her and she snapped something about how she told our server already that they're out of propane so there's nothing they could do. We responded, okay can we be reseated inside or near another a heater? Somewhat reluctantly she agreed. In my opinion they should have apologized for the inconvenience and promptly offered to reseat us-- it was about 50 degrees out after all. 

Inside it took nearly 45 minutes for our food to arrive and even then it was only after we finally flagged down and asked our server if she would check on our order. She delivered the food like a hit and run, didn't even stay long enough for us to order drink refills or inquire about the missing salad dressing. 3 out of 4 of the meals were great.. Though a bit cold. The 4th was a burger that was ordered well and was delivered raw in the middle. We didn't bother sending it back as we couldn't find our server until everyone else was done with their meal and at this point we'd been there for over two hours.

In their defense I do feel our server was 90% of the issue. I could overhear other servers giving what sounded like great, attentive service. Asking customers if they'd like refills, how their food was, etc. Ours didn't offer a single refill or inquire about anything. On the way out we finally found her chatting it up and having a grand time with the hostess, maybe that's where she's been the whole night? 

If I ever decide to go back, the bean cake appetizers were tasty and the views are great, I'd go at lunch in hopes of it being warmer (no heaters necessary), them still having the iron city bites (which they'd run out of the night we went), and also with the hope of having a less distracted, more focused server."}
{"text":"Ok, not sure how to review this restaurant, so I'm going to start here:

Kid Friendly!!!  No, seriously, best kid friendly place I've been to in a long long time. Sit outside, it's gated off, and they can't get out of sight.  To boot, there are plenty of kayaks, ducks, and people for them to watch on a nice day!  Bathrooms could use some work,  but my kid is recently potty trained so it makes me feel more comfortable when he accidentally destroys it.

Beer!!!  They have plenty of it!!!!

Service!!! Is always very good (can't attest to normal tables because when we sit outside without reservations it's based on the bar

Food?!?!?  Ordered the \"old firehouse dip\"....holy crap!  They say it's spicy, how about dumping tons of jalapeños, yeah, fresh ones, membranes and seeds in a dip???  Look, I'm not a wussy guy, I grow habaneros to make sauce, but Jesus Christ they pour so many jalapeños in their dip that I mine as well eat it while sitting on the \"throne\" preemptively!  Seriously, I ordered a PBR while eating because it was the cheapest beer on the menu and I was at a point where i couldn't taste anything. Oh, there is cream cheese and bacon in it, yeah, right next to a side of \"blow torch\", good luck tasting that!!!!

Updated 10/2/16: service has gone downhill bad for the past year. Takes forever to get seated, 10-15 minutes for drink orders, 45 minutes for food. Still a great atmosphere, but order everything as soon as you sit down.  Being busy is not a correlation to slowness, always turtle speed."}
{"text":"The view of the lake on the outdoor patio  here is so beautiful. We were in North Park walking or dog and stopped by hoping we could get some lunch, but they don't allow dogs on the patio, which is kind of a bummer! Especially considering that North Park is a popular dog walking spot! So, we got some food to go, but I was soooo disappointed that I couldn't sit on the patio and take in the view of the lake and fall leaves. I hope their dog policy changes in the future. 

I ordered the seitan wings with chipotle BBQ sauce and they were delicious and a good serving size....about 10 pieces and equivalent to the size of what you'd expect boneless chicken to be. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like real chicken! The sauce was also flavorful.

We also ordered the pretzels and beer cheese. I thought the beer flavor was a little too overwhelming for my taste, so I didn't have more than a few bites.

I can't wait to come back next time without our dog and enjoy the patio here and sample some more from the menu. It's a great addition to North Park."}
{"text":"You can't beat the view, and the beer selection is pretty good.  But the food is not very nice and the service can be poor."}
{"text":"This is a place I can always count on.   Always have great service  and friendly employees.  This place is good for families as well.  And the perfect view of lake is always the \"cherry on top\".  Along with that the food is good.  Not matter what meal you can service.  Depending on what meal or time they may include a special like their squash soup, my favorite!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful night at this outdoor bar.  The food was well prepared.  The only negative parts of our dinner was service was very slow and they were out of some draft beers.  Great place to catch the setting sun.  Will definitely return and hopefully our service will be more efficient."}
{"text":"Maybe you can give a noisy little bar food restaurant on the edge of a beautiful lake 4 or 5 stars. I can't. Maybe the beer selection helps. I'm a wine drinker. Our lunch today was very disappointing, excluding the great view, of course. Overdone fried fish sandwiches, tasteless cole slaw, scary corn dogs for the granddaughters; each was a notably poor execution that won't soon be forgiven. From what I noticed on surrounding tables it wasn't that we made the wrong menu choices. The service was actually pretty good, partially I believe, because we arrived very early in the lunch hour. Like LeMont, this place wouldn't  last a month in another location."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because of the location. We had 8 people in our party. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. We waited for over an hour to be seated. 

Once seated, the wait continued. We waited 20 minutes for a server. When we asked about drinks, we were handed a scribbled note and told to read her notes. 

The kids meals were delivered after 30 minutes. The kids finished their meals before the adult meals arrived. Nothing was good. This was sloppy service, sloppy presentation, and bland cheap food that didn't match the menu description. 

Wish I had read the Yelp reviews before patronizing. It was quite a frustrating experience all the way around."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. Whether you want to have a meal, sit by the fire pit or even have some quiet time in the arodondak chairs watching the sunset each is perfect. Service is great and you must try their Fall Sangria."}
{"text":"Great view on the patio, food was good. We got the Rachel Carson wrap and the BLT and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful location. If you can sit outside by the water, you definitely should. They utilize the \"No Wait\" app, so that you can request a table ahead of time, which is really nice. The food is pretty good, nothing too gourmet, but when you combine it with the scenery, it's a great spot."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  Super yummy apps and the burgers are perfection!!!  So fun to sit by the water, it was even raining when we were there---didn't care"}
{"text":"I love this place because of its outdoor terrace overlooking a beautiful lake. The food is usually tasty and service is acceptable. The Arsenal Cider is a must try."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Pittsburgh Area. The views are absolutely stunning, especially around sunset during the summer. The staff are very friendly. Most importantly, the food is outstanding. The burgers are very juicy and flavorful. The drinks are refreshing. The beer cheese dip that comes with the twisted spokes (pretzel appetizer) is addicting and delicious. This is my go-to restaurant to bring out of town guests to."}
{"text":"The best time to go to the OTB (at the Boathouse) is any time. It's even better when you don't have to wait. You can join the waitlist through the Yelp App or No Wait - if you think it will be busy. 

My boyfriend and I went to OTB on Saturday at 5:30pm. During the spring and summer, it's nice to sit on the patio... but when it's 45 degrees and rainy... you sit inside. We got seated right away, but it got busy as the night went on. 

I started with a Victory Winter Chill beer - they have a good draft list, but it's ever changing. You can always ask to try the beer and they will give you a free sample. 

For an appetizer- we started with the Tangled Spokes (everything on their menu is bike theme) the spokes are delicious soft pretzels from The Pretzel Shop in Southside. They come with a side of pale ale beer cheese - they are delicious. 

For my dinner - I opted for the North Ridge Nachos. They are topped with pico de Gallo, roasted corn, jalapeños, black beans, and their secret nacho cheese sauce. I added the adobe pulled pork - it also comes with a side of sour cream and guacamole. The nachos were to die-for - however.. I asked if they could hold the jalapeños... but they were definitely on the nachos. 

Overall, I enjoyed my evening and I'm glad they are open year round because the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Well I had high hopes for this place, because the views are incredible, but the dining experience fell short and that's why I give them a 3.5 star rating. Upon arriving, my friend and I were not greeted. We stood there and waited for what seemed like forever while the hostess scrambled around behind the station. She didn't ask if we wanted to sit inside or outside, just proceeded to walk until I mentioned we wanted to sit outside. 

Once we were seated and had looked over the menu we caught ourselves waiting again for our waitress that didn't seem to be in a hurry to come over to our table. Needless to say I think the service here is a little rusty and could use some work. 

We both ended up getting the babes on bikes burger that had avocado, bacon, egg, and bbq aioli. I thought the burger was really good and cooked just right. Chips came with it or you can upgrade to fries for a $1. We both got fries and I wasn't to impressed; they seemed to be really soggy. 

I am not sure if I would return which is unfortunate because it's so close to home and the views of north park are beautiful!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for American / bat food fusion. Great beer selection. Don't come here expecting something fancy, come expecting something fun. The bathrooms are shared with the park, so they aren't great. I've come here for dinner with friends, a beer after a run, or an appetizer for lunch. Food is always good, but I'd recommend the appetizers or burgers.

Definitely worth checking out. Make sure you get the \"no wait\" app to avoid waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This is just a review of the bar. There was a significant markup on drafts ($14 for two drafts that cost $8 at whole foods). Beers poured flat with little head or lacing, and also tasted dirty. If you're looking for a decent view with no regard to tasty beverages this would be your place. If you'd like a tasty beer avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Ahhh... I don't know what I want to say about OTB.  The concept it great, but the execution leaves something to be desired.

All 3 stars are for the outdoor seating on the lake.  It's nice to have a drink and sit out on the lake.

The drinks kind of suck.  I ordered a whiskey sour a few weeks ago, and it contained little to no alcohol.  And a lime.  A LIME.  Come on.  Pick any other alcoholic garnish, and it would have been better.  It also wasn't a whiskey sour.  I have no idea what she put in this $8 drink but it was just.... No.

The appetizers have been ok.  Overpriced but fine.  The servers tend to be overworked and not check in too often, which leads to REALLY long wait times.

Don't go if there is a wait or no patio seating available.  It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Over The Bar is in North Park's old Boat house with lovely views of the lake. The patio has heaters to keep you warm on a cool day. We frequent here a lot. They have now added as a side option to your entree tater tots . I had the fish tacos like I always do. They are second to the ones at NPL. You get 3 and I also got a nice size side salad. Son loves their buffalo chicken wrap. The nachos on the appetizers are a large portion and very good. If you like beer the bar selections are many. But don't waste your money on any other drinks . Apparently they use a mix for the margarita like you buy at GE and is very tart. Couldn't make me the banana martini I asked for because they didn't have the premade mix. The wine sangari was ok. Their burgers are very good. The wait is never too long especially if you use the no wait app. Parking is very sufficient. But the last time we were there our table outside was very sticky( maybe some goo be gone is needed). Noise level varies but usually you can have a conversation easily."}
{"text":"My brother took me to OTB while visiting the very underrated city of Pittsburgh. We actually went to the suburban location of OTB, which I believe only opened recently. The weather was dicey, but we gave the patio a shot and it paid off. The view of the water is awesome, people watching is prime, and the vibe is very casual. It took awhile for someone to come greet our party of 8, but once we were taken care of, service was very good. I forget the waiters name but he was very chill, friendly, and make some good recommendations for food and beer. The beer list is not extensive, but has a lot of quality. The food menu is pretty typical of a bicycle cafe; apps, sandwiches, and burgers that would hit the spot after a bike or canoe ride. The quality of the food is above average, but not 5 stars.  For me this is the place where I am going to do something active, and then reward myself with a solid meal and a few beers! Workout killer, but worth it! I look forward to checking out the Carson St. location next time I am in town. Cheers OTB!"}
{"text":"Is there ever a time when there isn't a wait??  Do NOT come here unless you are using the Nowait app.  And if you are using the app, you probably need to add 10-15 minutes on the estimated time provided. 

Don't get me wrong, there is no better place to be on a beautiful day than having a drink and a light bite on their patio, but I've never been able to be seated here quickly.  Outside of the wait and the typically slow service, they have a decent selection of wines and beers and I've enjoyed all my entree selections from the fish and chips to the Buffalo chicken wrap and their salads.   

My only other gripe is that I wish they would allow dogs on the patio.  I'm fully aware that I'm a crazy dog mom but I have to believe there are others who take their dogs to walk at the lake and wouldn't mind stopping for a bite and drink before heading home but can't because they have a four-legged friend in tow!"}
{"text":"OTB is a town favorite of mine due to its beautiful patio, great view of the lake, and delicious food. I was able to enjoy a Salmon bowl after playing tennis and running in the park. OTB must have updated their menu with many more healthy vegan and Paleo options! I am definitely a fan of this change!!"}
{"text":"i honestly thought about 3 stars, but the view itself bumped it up to 4 stars. 

We decided to stop by OTB on Saturday evening. Unfortunately there was an hour wait and someone left their phone in my car. We decided to leave and return the phone rather than having the person wait 2 hours on their phone. We headed back Sunday evening for dinner but this time used the No Wait app (they do not take reservations) 

The patio seating with the lake as the backdrop is absolutely beautiful!! I would honestly recommend trying here just for the view.

For dinner, I was stuck between the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. Bobby decided to get the shrimp & i decided to get the fish. We both ordered fries as our side & i also ordered a side salad since i was craving one. 

Bobby ordered the McCandeless.. which was OTB's version of a Moscow Mule. it was tart, but very delicious. i only tried a few sips even though i would've LOVEDDD a drink on the patio, but im anti drinking & driving. I told bobby next time he has to play DD lol 

There are a few reasons why i initially wanted to rate 3 stars. Our service was not the best. First, it took him awhile to greet us.. in his defense he seemed busy and told us twice he'll be over in a moment. He apologized and it wasn't too big of a deal-- we were enjoying the view and checking out the menu. However, during our meal service was still spotty. No extra napkins, no refills ect. They may have been understaffed. I only noticed 2 servers on the patio taking orders so maybe that is the reason. Another reason for thinking of 3 stars is the menu really isnt too big. It has nice options (appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches) but it just didnt have too many options. It is a burger bar so i'll give i'll forgive it for not having a ton of entrees.

Anyways, the atmosphere made up for everything. This would be an awesome date night or birthday dinner.. just for the views alone. Kayaking is offered right next to the restaurant and it was fun to watch the kayakers. We thought about it, but i was in my not-so-comfy church clothes and we decided to stop back another time. Also, after dinner if you want to stay and enjoy the scenery, OTB offers lots of chairs on the patio to sit and enjoy a drink after dinner. 

Note: My friend gave a huge thumbs up on their sunday brunch."}
{"text":"OTB is the gem of north park. Delicious food, beers, Bloody Mary's, and coffee!

For me, there is nothing better than treating myself to a beer after a long run! OTB is perfectly situated in the park to allow for such a treat. 

I highly recommend sitting on the deck when the weather is nice. Grab any one of their delicious appetizers and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great view and great food. Draft list was exceptional. Service was friendly and fast. The decor was pretty cool. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was there for Father's Day lunch with my family.  Good food and location are great.  Service continues to be an issue.  Slow never clears dirty plates until they want to get paid.  Lots of young help standing around and talking or checking their cell phones.  I asked for a second beer and the original beer I ordered the keg kicked.  The second beer I ordered the keg kicked.  Then when I ordered bottled beer I did not get until I was done with my meal."}
{"text":"I adore the original OTB in the South Side. I love North Park and run there quite often. Imagine my delight when I found out the old boathouse was being given new life by the good, veggie friendly folks at OTB! What a great idea with so much potential!
We decided to go one Friday afternoon for some light bites. It was a warm afternoon and plenty of people were sitting on the gorgeous patio over looking North Park lake. We waited quite a lengthy bit of time for the host to seat us, despite there being open tables and only one party in front of us. We weren't in a hurry, so this wasn't a huge issue, but I did take note of how unorganized things seemed. The space was limited from the start, as they worked inside the footprint of the boathouse. This means indoor seating is limited and somewhat cramped, so we were happy to sit outdoors and take advantage of the view and sunshine. The patio is adorable and welcoming, with a fire pit and adirondack chairs placed near the dining tables. We looked over the menu and decided to get a few appetizers. The seitan wings in sweet chili barbecue flavor and the \"Tangled Spokes\", or soft pretzels with beer cheese. The restaurant was pretty busy, but our waitress was noticeably absent for most of our dining experience. We had to flag somebody down to get napkins and silverware. The food was good, about what I'd expect knowing what the original OTB is capable of. The boathouse menu seemed smaller to me, but there was still a few veggie sandwiches I'd be happy to try. My only real complaint about this place was the service. Our waitress could have turned over our table rather quickly if she had been paying attention. One of my dining pet peeves is waiting forever for the check. Which we did. I don't enjoy feeling like a restaurant is holding me hostage. I would have loved to given this OTB a four star review based on just the food and beautiful setting. But the service knocked it down a notch. When we finally left the line waiting for seating was literally out the door. I can't even imagine how long those poor people waited, since the tables weren't being turned over efficiently. I hope they can get the kinks worked out, because this will be a killer spot if they can pull it together."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to leave a review but honestly OTB is one of my favorite places to go in the summer. This is the perfect place to go with friends, or family, to grab a beer or a nice cider and relax by the lake. For so many years, the boathouse was just... a boathouse. Only filled with bathrooms and for storage. I'm so thrilled that they actually made something of this beautiful establishment! 

They have indoor and outdoor seating, which is nice for those rainy days. I obviously prefer sitting out back on their patio overlooking North Park Lake. Sometimes the wait for a table can be long, especially after 5pm. But if you use the \"NoWait\" app, you can put yourself on the waitlist ahead of time. 

The menu isn't the largest but their burgers and salads are to die for, especially their \"Heaven On Earth\" burger. It honestly is just that. SO yummy! I recommend trying it with a turkey patty. Their appetizers are actually a good portion size to split between 2 or 3 friends. Try their black bean cakes! So warm and oozing with flavor.

OTB has a happy hour 5-7 and I believe their deals are usually $2 off whatever is on tap and $1 off cocktails and bottled drinks. 

Try this place after a nice run around the lake or a beautiful ride kayaking on the lake itself. So deserving and well worth it!"}
{"text":"The location is OTB's #1 feature. We love sitting by the lakeside; outside, weather permitting.

The food is decent for a fairly casual place, we've never had any serious complaints, and the service is usually good, as well.

The Lakeside Salad is my goto item on the menu - a way to eat out while still feeling like I'm eating healthy. I've had it a number of times and always enjoyed it. At $14.99, it's the most expensive item on the menu, which mainly tells you that all of the prices are pretty reasonable.

Other entrees I've had were tasty, but many [of those I'm tempted by] aren't particularly geared toward healthy eating.

The only complaint I can remember ever having had about the food is that a brioche bun is, IMHO, too soft for a sandwich. I think I had one with the pulled pork sandwich, once, and it was something of a soggy mess. Something with more structure would be a better offering.

Also, the by-the-glass wine selection is modest -- marginally acceptable for what they are trying to be, or for what I'd like them to be.  The wines are decently priced but the pours are not overly generous. Maybe two different sizes could be offered? A wider selection, including a few \"better\" wines, would also be appreciated.

One last thing - be prepared to wait for a table if the weather is nice. NoWait is a godsend."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Monday date night with my boyfriend. We sat out on the deck closest to the water watching a beautiful sunset while we ate. The view was the best part of this restaurant. The food is ok, nothing special. We both had burgers that were not seasoned with salt or pepper. Under seasoned food or non seasoned food kills a restaurant. The waitress was hardly seen and our food was given to us without napkins and silverware. The feel I got from the employees working here was that they could give two craps less about their job and that is the type of service everyone here receives. The view is the only thing saving this restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrific place. Really unique for the area.  Service was excellent and food was quickly delivered and was delicious. The fish sandwich was outstanding as was the wedding soup. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"We just moved up to North Park, and this place is great.  Food aside, the ambiance is great in the summer - sitting out on the lake, enjoying a few beers after work.  It's perfect!  

Food - the burgers are good too.  I got The Thick, which is one of the best BBQ burgers I've had.  Their coleslaw isn't that great to eat solo, but is fresh and has a nice crunch if you want to add it to the sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was good! 

Service was attentive and friendly even when my incredibly grumpy 3 year old threw his applesauce and we had to rush out of the restaurant. 

Location is awesome. Beautiful view of the water."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with friends after dinner. We all ordered cocktails and decided to share the spinach artichoke dip. The cocktails were weak--disappointing considering they were $8 each. The spinach dip was the worst dip I've ever had. It was basically cream cheese with a couple pieces of artichoke mixed in. Didn't even see any green in the dip at all so I'm not sure how it qualifies as SPINACH artichoke dip. The pita bread it came with was doughy and seemed undercooked. 

Super disappointing because I wanted to love this place. The location is great but the rest left a lot to be desired. I guess their standards go down after the dinner crowd leaves. Won't be in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"What a gem!  We went for lunch, the absolute most beautiful view of the lake. The food was fresh & delicious! Such a great vibe, so glad we found it!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Food is good. Great beer selection. Sat outside overlooking the lake. Be prepared to wait for a table. Use the...No Wait app!
Restrooms are gross but they are for to anyone in the park."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Always feels like vacation when you go. Food is typical bar food and service isn't always the best but when you go you feel like you have escaped everything."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It is a great addition to North Park and the North Hills.  Located in the old Boathouse, it is a great reinvention of an old spot.  The architecture of the building is classic, intricate and beautiful and the location right on the edge of North Park Lake is stunning.  I promise when you are sitting on their deck, underneath one of their large, red umbrellas you will feel far, far away from Pittsburgh.

The food is delicious and tries to lean towards the healthier side of things, but there's definitely some sinfully delicious items.  The \"Rachel Carson Wrap\", named after a famous Pennsylvanian ecologist, is their version of buffalo chicken wrap with grilled chicken, buffalo sauce, blue cheese dressing on a soft, warm delicious pita.  Definitely recommend if you're a fan of some spice like myself.  Recently I tried the Lakeside Salad which features mixed greens with a HUGE filet of salmon with goat cheese, craisins and candied walnuts with housemade balsamic vinaigrette.  It was delicious and surprisingly VERY filling.  Other things to check out...their caprese Panini and housemade potato chips with a hint of ranch flavoring dusted on.

Pretty much the only reason I'm not giving five stars is sometimes the service can be a little slow.  Last time cashing out our check took an incredibly long time, and for another table near us took almost 20 minutes and them asking multiple servers for help.  It is always busy here (plan to get here early, especially on a beautiful day!) but they should plan their staffing accordingly.

Overall, a MUST do if you are in the North Park area!"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here and the service seems to be sliding south quickly. The location is perfect and the interior decor is spot on. That's where the upside seems to end. 

We were seated for breakfast immediately but then waited 10 minutes for menus, 20 minutes to order and I fear that it may be lunchtime before we get our breakfast. I'm sitting amongst fellow patrons who's heads are on swivels, looking for a server who can top off a drink, replace a coffee mug stained with lipstick, and put out an APB for their food. 

We're at North Park all the time, but sadly, we'll avoid OTB until Yelp indicates that it's safe to return."}
{"text":"Not as good as the southside location but still not bad, the location and ambiance more than make up for the drop in food quality. The view, the patio, the charm of the boathouse will have you returning for more beers after that long bike ride..."}
{"text":"Though I had gone kayaking multiple times on North Park Lake, I had never stopped at OTB until a warm(er) Saturday in January. My friend, my infant, and I met at OTB for breakfast before going on a walk together. We were seated on a still-covered patio with heaters cranking. It was a quiet morning in the restaurant but the environment was definitely kid friendly. 

I ordered the Breakfast Tacos which were filled with egg, cheese, and sausage and (maybe it was my imagination?) also even seemed relatively good for me. I was able to go on our walk without feeling stuffed and gross, which was a major plus! Plus, a Mimosa followed by a Nitro Coffee were the perfect beverages to kick-start my day."}
{"text":"My favorite place in North Park. Has this dip called firehouse dip, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Poor service. Female bartender was rude to the women of the group (manager bought them a round) and male bartender swore just to swear. We're at a bar, but you don't have to act like a tough guy just because of that. I would go back if I was invited or maybe to try the food. I guess I could give it another chance to try the food."}
{"text":"Delicious food, awesome service and great atmosphere with a view of the lake! Menu is really great selection! A must go!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The best part is being able to sit outside and eat and not be right on the road like most places in Pittsburgh. The table although just cleared off was sticky. We ordered the black bean appetizer. It was spicy. Wish the waitress had told us that. You get 3 big pancakes but very little pineapple salsa, sour cream and guacamole. We split the Pablo crusted cod. It was good, not dry. The chips were good too. We had the creamsicle dessert, couldn't fix out what the main part was. It was good though. The menu is limited, a few salads, burgers and wraps."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here. Each meal has been delicious: I've have the portobello tacos, thick burger, Panini's and sweet chili chicken. The servers remember me and are incredibly friendly. The beer selection leans mostly to IPA's but other varieties can be found."}
{"text":"Took the family out for a meal at over the bar tonight. The no wait app said that they were seating so we went straight ahead expecting to be seated right away. Upon arrival we waited five minutes before anyone acknowledged we were even there. It's pretty hard to miss a family with two boys under the age of 10.  We could see a table open that we could sit at but it was dirty and we had to wait for it to be cleaned. A group of gentlemen walked in behind us , step in front and pointed to a table. They asked if they could can we sit down and they actually seated them before they seated us. What? 
I just found that a bit rude.
Our server was nice but you could tell she was slightly overwhelmed. We ordered the soft pretzels with beer cheese. Two hamburgers and two kids meals. The soft pretzels and beer cheese were hit with the family everyone loved it. Sadly the rest of the meal left a lot to be desired. i'm not sure they use any seasoning at all in the preparation of the foods. The ingredients are fresh but salt is needed to enhance flavor. My husband's black bean burger tasted more like a grass burger, I felt sorry for him while watching him eat it. I could tell it was a struggle. He just could not enjoy it. The kids meals were french fries and chicken tenders but again no seasoning to be heard of. Thank goodness for ketchup because it was all you could taste. 
Went to the bathroom not expecting to be public but it was, I guess we were lucky that it is an off-season for the park. Signs in the bathroom stated it was public but OTB would attend to its needs. We are giving this three stars just because of the location and the potential it has. Season your food, restructure your service and you will be a winner."}
{"text":"I was here during Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week and really need to get back. I can't speak for the winter months but in warm weather the scenery and ambiance of OTB is fantastic with the open dining area and patio on the lake.  I bet Fall would be beautiful.

Driving back to the location through the parks is interesting. It looks like a lot of activities like rope courses, zip lines and bike trails. Eventually to deadens into a castle like structure which is OTB. It looks very nice from the outside sitting in front of the lake.  There is plenty of parking available.

We went in and there was a Weyerbacher Tap Takeover going on.  We were able to grab beers from the bar and quickly made our way outside to the patio on a nice Spring day. We sat around the fire ring (no fire) in some nice comfortable wooden chairs. We had a chance to talk with the Weyerbacher reps and they provided us with several beers to try free of charge. These were full size pints.  Now I know this isn't the normal restaurant's practice but it was their decision to bring these folks in and the main reason we decided to make the trip. Weyerbacher makes excellent beer!  Looking at their normal beer list, it appeared to be decent on the craft selection.

After a few hours of drinking and longing on the patio we spoke with a hostess who sat us inside to eat. They are obviously known for their burgers and had a selection of several gourmet burgers at moderate prices. They also had appetizers and traditional sandwiches. I opted for the Heaven on Earth Burger which came with roasted red peppers, spinach, tomato, mozzarella and Sriracha ranch on the burger and a side of fries. The burger was a good size and delicious. I greatly enjoyed the burger. The fries were nothing great. I also ordered the Old Firehouse Dip with tortilla chips. It's was served warm and very tasty but on the small side. I would recommend it as an appetizer for no more than two.

Service here was quick and friendly for as busy as they were. While the food was good, the location and atmosphere is what really stands out the most. A nice relaxing place to grab a beer or 6.  Enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"First let me say that this is my first experience at this establishment. I've heard great things and wanted to check it out. I went with a few friends and was in the waiter \"Brian's\" section. 
We sat and waited 20 minutes for water. Ordered our food and soup as appetizer. Took 35 additional minutes to receive the French onion soup we all ordered and the cheese wasn't melted and the soup was, to say the least cold... at this point we had empty drinks and wasn't asked for refills. We told the server and the manager supposedly was comping our first round of drinks and the soup. We waited another 15 min for our burgers which came out cold. 
When we got our bill we had a 3$ discount; for two ice teas. Clearly upset we told Brian we didn't have the drinks or soup taken off and his response was \"was there something wrong with your drinks?\" 
I was embarrassed and humiliated but most of all
Livid that I got such horrible service; plus a shi**y attitude! I won't return. 
Thanks for your service Brian."}
{"text":"The food does not disappoint. The Thick is the best burger I have ever tasted. Amazing views of the lake and a great beer selection.  I keep coming back for more. 

They also serve breakfast (which I just found out today on their site). I'm definitely looking forward to trying it out."}
{"text":"I ate here last night on a first date. It has a really nice atmosphere if you get a table outside. Use the NoWait app and you will get seated more quickly. We were greeted quickly but after that the service was very mediocre. I was disappointed in their draft list too -I wish they had at least one IPA on tap. I ordered the tandem (grilled cheese with white american,sharp cheddar, and provelone) which came with tomato soup. I chose fruit for my side. There was far too much bread for the amount of cheese. The bread was tasty and this could have been a really good sandwich if the bread to cheese ratio was more proportionate. The tomato soup was delicious and a nice touch for dipping. My date had the peddle paddle panini (Loaded with buffalo mozzarella, roasted red peppers, sliced tomato, and fresh basil pressed together between Breadworks bread). Yes, everything has a bicycle theme if that was not obvious already. He said he comes there often and it's one of his favorite sandwiches. It looked good, however, I don't think it was probably worth the price. in fact, the price point here is a little high I think for a place that is supposed to be more casual. I saw they had a firepit set up with some chairs so maybe I'd come back to sit around that with a cold beverage, but otherwise I was not impressed enough to make a huge effort to return."}
{"text":"What an absolutely idyllic setting for brunch! I mean it's just as pretty as can be. The service was fine, not exceptional by any means, but they were very busy on a gorgeous Sunday so I can understand why our server seemed flustered. The Goode as very good. We tried the BLT and the breakfast tacos. Both were delicious but my favorite part was their hash browns. Holy cow they were yummy and crisp. I really want to come back on a nice evening for dinner because I'm sure we could spend hours on their lovely deck enjoying the views of the lake. The bloody Mary's were also very good, they offer local vodka that was smooth and yummy in the mix. We will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Located in North Park. Casual atmosphere. Looks and feels like you're at a boathouse! Friendly service. Bar, dining area and patio seating. Lots of beer and several cocktail choices as well. Average prices ranging from under $10 to around $15 per person. Lots of parking is available but I believe this is a common location for various walks/runs in the park so be prepared to encounter special events and extra people. They weren't overly busy though when we went around 1230 on a Saturday even though a small race was going on. 

Several appetizers, salads and sandwiches available. I opted for the Lakeside Salad without nuts (mixed greens, salmon, craisins, goat cheese, candied walnuts). The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium temp and was well seasoned such that I didn't need dressing on my salad. Perfect size also. I'd imagine it's pretty busy here when the weather is nice because of the location. I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location! Average food. Very good Bloody Mary. Friendly staff. Gorgeous view! The highs, the lows all average out to...well, average.

The burger selections sounded amazing, when they arrived they were so-so. The burgers themselves had no flavor but for artificial-looking and tasting \"grill\" marks. The hubby's burger with barbecue sauce, onion rings, cheese and bacon sounded right his alley...as did my burger with spinach, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, tomato and Sriracha ranch. Eh...they need some work. Like quality beef in the burger, a good, not dry, bun on the BBQ one or on mine fresh spinach and slabs of roasted peppers would work far better than bitty pieces of peppers lost in wet steamed (?) spinach. 

What passes for a decent burger with the South Side crowd on a Saturday night may be far different than what's acceptable in the North Hills. Stepping up your burger game might be something worth looking into, OTB. 

In the meantime, I'm looking forward to warm weather and a good Bloody Mary on the OTB patio with a couple of friends while watching wildfowl on the lake. Well be back and looking forward to improvements...it's too lovely of a dining spot not to go back and try again."}
{"text":"One the best summer hangouts in the city.  Cool ambience on the lake at North Park, the food is excellent given the location and all, and reasonably priced.  Definitely recommend doing the 5 mile loop and grabbing a drink here to cool off."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and sat on the patio.  Lots to pick from on the menu.  Our server was very friendly and courteous but when our food came, my husband was missing his side dish.  He enjoyed the fish tacos but they were more breaking than fish.....suggestion...prepare with grilled fish please!  I had the turkey burger over a salad.  The turkey burger was very flavorful and our server added lots of veggies.....but forgot the cheese.  The dressings were a disappointment. Homemade but more oil than flavor.  

I look forward to try again as I think the beautiful weather had them understaffed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful view of the lake at North Park. Good beer selection. Fish tacos very tasty. Server was prompt and friendly offered suggestions regarding entrees that were dead on."}
{"text":"I was traveling through the area for work and coworkers picked this spot for a casual dinner and beer after a long day of meetings.  

Pros:
-The views are fantastic.  I felt like I was at summer camp - with a beer selection
-Casual atmosphere
-Draft beer options

Cons:
-Some kegs were kicked
-Service was a little slow

Recommendations:
-Definitely check it out!  
-Be careful driving to OTB - radar everywhere.  Follow speed limit signs."}
{"text":"This is def one of my favorite places to go! Obviously summer or warm weather is the prime time to go, but I've gone in the winter and sat as close to outside as possible and really enjoyed watching people ice fishing on the lake.
Got to go for breakfast once and it was amazing. Sitting outside on a warm summer morning having a delicious, fresh breakfast was a little bit of heaven in my opinion!
Keep up the good work with the versatile menu options. Not many places around like this one!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Service can sometimes be on the slow side but they are usually packed so it's understandable and usually worth the slight wait."}
{"text":"After wanting to come to the OTB Bicycle Cafe for a few years, I finally decided to stop down last night (Monday). It was finally a nice day in Pittsburgh so I took my daughter here at 4:45. I noticed on YELP there was no wait at that time so we drove down. We were seated immediately and chose outdoor seating. 

Scenery/Location: Really gorgeous view, smell, and sounds. We watched the fisherman and got a table closer to the water. It was amazing. 

Food: I got the BLT. The bicycle one with egg and cheese with a side of homemade chips. It was very good and not too filling. My daughter got the corn dogs with a side of broccoli. Her meal came on a collectible frisbee that she was able to keep. She liked the corn dogs. 

Pricing: our two meals including a chocolate milk and a coke came to just under $20.00. I thought that was very reasonable. 

Service: The waitress was friendly and courteous. They appeared to have only 2 servers for the outdoor area so considering that, I don't think We had to wait very long. The longest part (maybe 10-12 minutes) was waiting for our drinks. It could have been better and a little faster, but there's not much to complain about. I tipped the waitress $7.00. 

We will be returning. There's a few other things on the menu I'd like to try and during a nice, cool day you can't beat the scenery. It's awesome that I can see whether or not there is a wait so that's a plus. There is also indoor seating that looked nice too. I'd recommend this spot for sure."}
{"text":"Calling out the owners on this: The place has such an amazing amount of potential. What a view and the deck is excellent! That being said the food was very cold. Bathrooms were disgusting. And get some lighting out on that back deck, we sat in total darkness and had to use our phones as lights to read the menu. 

Would gladly 5 star it with those things fixed."}
{"text":"Limited menu, extremely bland hummus, slow service. Good place in the summer to grab a drink but leave it at only a drink. The chicken wrap and burger seem like they were picked up at Giant Eagles and put on a plate. Only upside from our experience was we didn't have to cook."}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant on the lake. Tons of beers on draft and really great burgers. I definitely recommend trying the Rachel Carson chicken wrap. Great appetizers as well. You really can't get a better view them on their deck overlooking the lake on a hot summer day. I also highly recommend making a reservation online before hand, as they frequently get very busy especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"The view is better than the food honestly. Nice variety in the beer list. Recent order was their take on a Nashville Hot chicken sandwich. The chicken was crispy and moist, however, the sandwich was not spicy/hot at all. Good place to grab a bite to eat if you're in the park or passing through. 

Bonus is getting in line for a table through the app!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place due to its location on the water and the amazing set up and view. You won't find anything else like it. Unfortunately since its opening a couple years ago I've been nothing short of disappointed with the service and food. Servers take a long time to respond even on a non busy day sitting at the bar. The food is also average at best. I am not sure if it's a management issue or what but I have been there at least 8 times and it hasn't gotten any better"}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say that this is an awesome location! Great views with a very cool atmosphere. They have Adirondack chairs, umbrella tables, and even a fire pit on the patio. My brother and I ate dinner outside despite the cooler Spring weather. Luckily, we were seated under one of the many kerosene heaters. The food was good, pretty standard. We both ordered burgers and fries. The waitress talked me into trying the The Dirt Rag Delight, which is a bacon cheeseburger with Wholey's peanut butter and dill pickles. It was unlike anything I've had before. My brother had 'The Thick' and said it was good as well. They had a nice selection and variety of foods to choose from. Next time I think I'll try something else, like the fish tacos. I had a decent mojito, it wasn't in a large glass and still cost $7 which was a bummer.

Sadly, service wasn't the best. When we arrived we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. So naturally we headed to the bar for a drink. Literally two minutes later they called us and said our table was ready. We hadn't even ordered drinks yet. I'm not complaining that we were seated quickly. But I watched two groups leave when they were told there was a wait. I'm not sure why they were purposely turning customers away, since there were 8 tables visibly available. It was very strange. Our waitress was okay, we had to wait about 15 minutes for her to bring the check. If I had to guess they were understaffed and training some new employees.

Overall this was a cool place. I'd go back just for the view and atmosphere. It's kind of a great oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I'd love to come back for a relaxing lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened the food was much better. I have gone a few times within the last 6 months and the food has gone way down hill. The menu has changed and very limited. The firehouse dip was one of my favorites but even that has changed not for the good. The only reason so busy is because of location and view. They are the only game in town. No other place to eat around the lake with a view."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch today at the OTB Boathouse in North Park. We had the Rachael Carson Chicken wrap and delicious coleslaw. Grilled chicken with provolone cheese lettuce and tomato and a side of ranch dressing on s warm pita. It was a beautiful sunny day in the 70's to eat outdoors by the lake. This is my second time here. Great service and friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"Probably my wife's favorite dinner spot so I rounded up because of that.  OTB in North Park really is worth a visit even if you just want to sit on the porch over looking the lake and sip some wine or something from their great tap list.  The food is above average, I usually go with  the burger with egg and avocado...I am a sucker for burgers and this one is good or their Cuban.  My wife almost always gets the Cuban or the nachos.
OTB in the end is a pretty good food choice with great views and good beer.  The service has been slow before, but also has been great.
I definitely recommend checking in on some on-line reservation place or going during off hours because it gets packed."}
{"text":"Check it out.  Great location overlooking the lake.  Nice view.  If your are biking, running or just looking to relax this is a good spot.  Many beers on tap and nice menu with some vegetarian options.  The place was busy.    

Don't forget the soup, like our waitress did!  Good soup, soup of the day was a vegetarian Southwest.  Very good with some nice spiciness.  Pedal paddle panini was loaded with mozzarella, roasted red peppers, sliced tomato and fresh basil.  Very good, wish it had a tad more basil thou.

Our waitress worked hard and was busy but could probably use a few training sessions."}
{"text":"I love going to OTB & grabbing a beer and sitting in the sun on their patio by the lake. The menu is fairly limited, but the food I've tried has been good (salads & sandwiches). They have lots of decent beer on tap & in bottles. I often stop in after renting at SUP & paddling around the lake. It's really enjoyable in great weather with a lovely view. I've not been there in fall or winter yet, but look forward to stopping in."}
{"text":"Low key place to grab a bite or a beer with a nice view of the lake.  Food was decent.  Very casual... like, feel free to go jogging, biking, or fishing and stop by for a bite."}
{"text":"They have a nice large outside patio where you can eat and enjoy the view of the lake.  The patio also has a fire pit and chairs around it, they have other chairs scatter about, nice to sit down with a drink and watch all the Kayakers!  There food is pretty good, the waitress we had was very friendly.  The service was quick.  It would be nice if they allowed dogs in the outside patio, I love to take my dog to the park."}
{"text":"It's taken a couple visits to form an opinion.  I think OTB is a nice change of pace.

Our first visit was not so good.  But we did make the mistake of visiting during their first week.  The kitchen was not putting out food and people were pretending not to mind the long wait.  Another nuisance was OTB serving all the kiddies meals on Frisbee's.  It was not pleasant watching small children assault each other and all the patio furniture with plastic discs.  When we finally got our food, it was decent.  My corn chowder was awesome.  Almost as good as the kind my mother and big brother used to make.  I also got a grilled cheese.  It was good.  BJ got a BLT.  Our sides were good, coleslaw and super yummy fries.

Next visit, we kept it simple.  BJ got the Seitan wings with chili soy.  He thought they were tasty.  He also liked that they were served with pita wedges and carrot and celery sticks.  I got chicken tenders.  They were heavily breaded and very crispy.  Another thing we like about OTB, they had a nice selection of seasonal pumpkin beers right now.

The best part of visiting is the patio.  And it's the main reason for the 4 stars.  The fire pit is great and so are the Adirondack chairs.  And you get an incredible view of the lake.  Also, all the staff is very friendly.  And so are the ever present owners.  It's really a fun spot to visit."}
{"text":"Good Bikes and Good Beer. If those two things make you happy, you want to come here.

Every time has been a great time for me.  So nice to meet up with others interested in beer and mountain or road biking.  Such a nice selection of GOOD beer.  Never expected to see something like this in North Park, which makes it even better. Ample parking unlike the city.  Amazing mosaic tile art."}
{"text":"Went on a few different occasions because I was hoping for a different outcome but never got it. Food was fine. Service was terrible. If you can get a seat outside by the lake, it's almost worth the trouble.
***Updated- Bad service is mostly wait staff's lack of attention. Also, I have experienced incorrect orders and extremely long ticket times."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe we had never gone. Bad, bad North Park users. I am the duchess of the park and had never been. Lol! After kayaking on the lake it just seemed like the perfect time to go. As we were paddling in I could see otb was busy. I checked my no wait app to see there was a 16 to 30 minute wait so I put our name on the list. We got all checked out with our kayaks, stopped at the bathroom, and went on in. It took less than 10 minutes. We were seated by a friendly hostess at the edge of the patio. It was a glorious day so sitting in the shade, the breeze was light and cooling, just awesome. The dining area is small both inside and outside but it doesn't seem small. The view of the lake is just amazing and it felt as though we weren't at North Park Lake but somewhere in the mountains enjoying vacation. We were greeted shortly after being seated by our friendly waitress. We both got drinks. The hubby a beer. I have no clue what kind but he liked it. The draft selection isn't huge but they had a variety. I chose the boathouse sangria which was sweet and smooth and lovely for a day like today. We ordered their pretzel app. The pretzels come from the Pittsburgh pretzel company on the south side and boy were they good. Doughy and not too salty. The cheese dip was light and yummy. I chose the biker babe burger but I got turkey burger instead. It was yummy. A fresh, delicious burger topped with avocado, bacon, and a fried egg. The hubby got the fish sandwich, Panco encrusted. It was a lightly breaded fish and it was fresh and flaky. The fries were seasoned nicely and it was just delightful. All the way around, just a lovely way to cap off our wonderful day enjoying this wonderful park."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go, especially when the weather is nice! Their Rachel Carson Wrap is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and they have the BEST french fries! I love that they are on the No Wait app as well. I'd give them more than 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Excellent location. Easy parking and access to the park. This was our second time eating there.   The food is good not amazing but good and filling. We had the salmon salads with goat cheese and walnuts. The salmon was thick and cooked perfectly. The view of the lake is perfect. The only  criticism  I would make is that they don't really have any healthy options on the menu. It's mostly burgers and bar food.  A lot of people go to the park to exercise and it would be nice if they had more items for the fitness conscious crowd."}
{"text":"What a relaxing, pretty deck to dine on! Too bad we had abysmal service by the server, and a manager. We were greeted cheerfully, seated promptly, and our drink orders taken quickly. Within 10-15 minutes of our arrival, the deck was filled, and the quick service went downhill, along with my order's accuracy (3 times). 

We ordered the North Ridge Nachos, and added grilled chicken ($3 more), for an appetizer. It was fresh and flavorful, with delicious, crisp tortilla chips, and so big, we only ate half, since we wanted to have dessert. It  could easily be a shared meal.  

I had the Slow Ride Salmon Sandwich. First I had the wrong order(server), then the right order, but slathered in aioli which I ordered OTS (food runner), then a cold, but correct order (different food runner). The other person ordered Henry's Fish Tacos. I tried several bites. Bland. It was probably cod ( we asked, but the server wasn't sure, and the food runners had no idea), which is a very mild fish. However, it was tender, flaky, hot and huge. Our dinners each came with a big side of slaw, also slightly bland, but creamy. It needed zing...Caraway seeds, perhaps.
 
Finally, the huge, homemade salmon cake arrived nestled in a fresh brioche bun, with lettuce, tomato, and dill aioli (OTS). The salmon cake was moist, done just right, and had fresh tomato and crisp lettuce with it. Loved the brioche bun. 

The server, Grace, while very nice, was MIA for 90% of our meal, so we didn't order dessert (we had been there over 1 1/2 hours by that time). I told the manager, Jared. He was surprised about Grace, one of his most experienced servers, and 2 weeks later, I was sent a $20 gift card (by Melissa Voltz, Front of House/Bar Mgr.), which I thought was cheap. If I'm wrong, I hope someone straightens me out. When I go back (and not to this location) obviously I can't order much past my salmon sandwich, and certainly not 2 (red Sangria) drinks. Or dessert.

Originally, we ordered an appetizer ($12), 4 drinks (2 drinks each), my sandwich ($11.99), and fish tacos ($11.99). I brought this to Jared's attention, and he just said he was sorry for the bad experience, and understood my disappointment. We live in the South Hills, and with an attitude like that, we're going to the Southside location, where I'm hoping we'll have much better, professional service."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Boathouse was disappointing... We've been there a couple of times but this by far was the worst experience we have had there. It took our waiter 20 minutes just to bring us waters. We ordered the Firehouse appetizer which was pretty good and had a lot of flavor. But then it took about 30 minutes to get our food (we were there on a Tuesday evening). I got the Rachel Carson wrap and it had absolutely no flavor and my friends got burgers which also had no flavor, at least it could have been seasoned it with salt and pepper! 

Not only was the food not great but it seemed like the tables around us were also annoyed with how bad our waiter was! He never checked on any of his tables. We had to wave him down to ask him for more water, plates for the appetizers and the check. I wish he would have focused more on his tables and maybe people would have actually left him a tip. We ended up being there for over a hour and a half, sorry but not happy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been semi-regulars at OTB for years and loved it until our last visit. We sat down and it took forever to get a server. We eventually got 2 servers who we had seen hanging out in front of the restuarant when we came in.  Nothing was explained to us, but my presumption was that one server was training/shadowing the other. We placed our order and our burgers (ordered medium) came out 30 minutes later...cooked medium, very cold with buns so soggy you could barely pick the burgers up. Clearly they had been ready for quite some time and the servers neglected to bring them to our table. The servers never checked to see how our food was and by the time they came back we had finished our burgers. We had to get our son from school so we wouldn't have even had the luxury of asking to have them remade. When we left $40 for a check that was $33.06 the server brought back $6 in change. So our food was served  cold and soggy, no one ever even asks us how it was, our change was shorted, but the worst part is we sent 2 messages on Facebook (OTB doesn't have an email address or contact button on their website at least not when we visited it) about our experience and neither was even responded too even though both show as being seen. We'll take our business elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT. BUT the service the 5 of us got our lunch at a different time not all together. I would come back if I lived closer. Coming in from CALIFORNIA it's hard to come here more often."}
{"text":"Fantastic location, charming atmosphere, but lackluster food. I've been to the OTB Bicycle Cafe in South Side multiple times, so I was excited to finally experience its sister restaurant. Unfortunately it was too chilly to sit on their patio, but the interior decor had its own appeal. Service started out great. We were seated quickly and orders were promptly taken, but the quality of our waitress's service dwindled the longer we were there. 

Unfortunately, the menu is not as appealing as their South Side counterpart. Sadly, this location didn't have seitan wings :( However, they still try to cater to their vegetarian customers with black bean cakes and a veggie burger option. As a health nut, I'm always trying to find ways to eat healthier, so I was glad to see they offered the veggie burger without the bun and fries over mixed greens - but wait, for $1 extra?!? I'm paying MORE for LESS food? What kind of backwards logic is that? Instead of getting ripped off, I decided to just go with their house salad and add on the black bean cakes. Nothing worth writing home about but I do commend them for offering a healthy vegetarian protein substitute. 

Overall, this place earned 2.5 (let's round up to 3) stars from me. It's convenience factor may be reason enough for me to come back to grab a meal if I'm in North Park, but I can easily find better quality food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The first time i ate here was on a week day afternoon right when they first opened and it was very crowded, i remember waiting for at least a half hour. I also remember the fish tacos tasting good. Didn't come back for a few years because it always looked too packed. Ate here again last Friday around 4:30 and didn't wait at all. The food and beer tasted great- got the BLT and a summer shandy. They play upbeat music and the view of the lake is beautiful! The menu is small but very creative with some local cuisine options all named after something bicycle / nature oriented. Just be smart about what time you come here or you will wait. But hey, at least you're at North Park so there's plenty of ways to pass the time!"}
{"text":"The food is not that great. The menu is small and underwhelming. The redeeming quality about this restaurant is the view it has of the lake. It is a wonderful place to sit and watch the lake."}
{"text":"If you just ran, biked, golfed, kayaked or simply want a casual dinner with a lakeside view, all are welcome at OTB part deux. The small bar and a handful of tables are tucked inside, but the perfect place is dining al fresco out on the deck, which runs the length of ye olde boathouse. The draft list is respectable and pairs well with burgers (choose your own protein or black bean), wraps and/or apps. Beware though, some happy hour food is only available at the bar and apparently sells out so be sure to have a plan B. Service was slow at first, but recovered throughout our meal. Overall, the OTB's ideal location is tough to beat after an active day in North Park - use the NoWait app to grab your spot in line ahead of the pack."}
{"text":"This place is nice if the weather is nice. The fish tacos were awesome along with the blackened chicken meals. If your seated outside this place is beautiful but always expect to wait no matter what time of day. We tried eating here 3 times before and the wait was well over an hour. You can use the No Wait app here. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"We go here often after playing at the park. Really good food! Sometimes the service is a tad slow, especially when it's busy, never seems to be staffed enough. But they are very accommodating to the kids. Love the ambiance of sitting outside on a nice day!"}
{"text":"Too cute not to love. In a region where restaurants with inviting outdoor atmosphere are few and far between, OTB is an honest gem. Perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some pretty decent food and drink. Prices are not exceptional, but the lakeside location makes everything worth it. Try the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"So far I have been very impressed with the food I have tried. Burgers are cooked exactly medium to medium rare as I like. Fish tacos might need some kind of a re-tooling. I had better fish tacos at Jergel's . Maybe add some black beans, Pico or Salsa Verde  and a spicy white cream slaw with cumin kick.  A Side from that issues that we mad aware where corrected quickly .  Blinding light beer cooler is toned down so you don't need sun glasses at the bar.. Now that they have HAPPY HOUR it makes it way more of a reason I / WE  will be back. besides the fact that I know 1/4 of the people who go there. 
In ending, This is a winner and a place I will continue to eat and drink in for many years !  1/2 Off Apps should be added with no exclusions."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food especially the burgers. The patio is beautiful with it's fire pit and lounge chairs that overlook North Park lake.  A great place to get together with friends for drinks"}
