{"text":"Catfish BOMB!!.... Chicken BOMB!!!.... Pizza BOMB!!!!  The most underestimated place in Phx. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best surprises ever walking into this place! From the looks of it, it doesn't look like a place I would normally stop to eat at. Thank goodness for friends! My friend brought me here last week and I'm back again on my own today. The cat fish was great! This time around I'm getting the chicken and, of course, I'm sneaking room in for another cat fish! But the best thing going are these biscuits! Oh, my food just arrived! Gotta go, but come check this place out! It's great!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken and Pizza/Hot Wings. This place is a restaurant and grocery/convenient store with money services and check cash."}
{"text":"I like their food but their service could be better. 
Their biscuits are so delicious"}
{"text":"If you want pizza, have WIC benefits to redeem, need a bong, jeans or even a single dinner knife this place has it all.

I came here on a tip about good pizza. From the outside I was skeptical, and once I walked in that skepticism increased as I saw a conveyor style oven.

At 4.99 the lunch special of a 10inch 1 topping pizza, soda, and a bread stick is great deal, so I had to try it. Surprisingly the pizza was pretty good especially for a $5 pizza, It is on par or above a papa john's type of pizza. The service was great too.

They did not have their full menu's in yet just a big lunch and dinner specials menu.  In addition to pizza they also have a friend ensemble of zucchini onion rings and more.

There is a big screen TV with cable and dance music playing on the radio. The fountain drink selection is vast but lacks any diet options.

If you are brave and want a solid value give this a try, if you are on a date and want a second one this may not be the best choice."}
{"text":"I think someone below nailed it when they said you could buy fried chicken, cash a WIC check, pick up a western union, and get a bong all under one roof."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. Some of the chicken is in the display heat box ready to go, but every time I've came they make it after I put in my order. So, expect a wait time for a bigger order. The service is friendly. Location is sketch, but the food is 5stars better than any other chicken chain."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while and LOVE their pizza and wings! My office is around the corner in a heavily industrial area so there aren't many options but this place saves me! Their chicken tenders are awesome as well. Many people won't 'hangout' here but don't miss out on this little gem if you're in the area. You can also call ahead and order and I've never had any problem!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place that when you drive by you would NEVER stop in, its a small small market that caters to WIC and food stamp people in the surrounding ghetto.  I work down the street and one day when driving by i saw a sign pop up that said \"Pizza & Wings\" and since i LOVE pizza we took the chance with our life and stopped in. 

The guys who work there are awesome and friendly.  The pizza is awesome, they make their own down and sauce, and all of the meats are BEEF based since they have a lot of Muslim customers.  I've been back tons of times and they have catered a few work lunches for us too!"}
{"text":"Every once and awhile I will get stuck in this part of town for work and this is definitely our go to spot when I am getting lunch for the guys(in the area anyway). The pizza is always good and the chicken isn't bad either. The way this place is set up is hilarious and convenient. It's definitely worth going in just for the experience, just not at night cause you will probably get mugged.... j/k...... kinda but maybe not really?"}
