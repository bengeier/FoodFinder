{"text":"I wanted so badly to love Sidecar.  It's a grown-up kind of place in the midst of 20-something hangouts, the reviews have been solid, it's cute as can be, it's not too expensive and it's a short walk from my house.  Alas, the service was unobtrusive to a fault.  The fault?  An empty beer glass was discreetly whisked away from my husband without the offer of another (\"yes, please\" would have been the answer).  Same for my own empty cava glass which was taken away by a waiter in a hurry, without any eye contact to give me the opportunity to ask for another.  The otherwise competent and lovely staff seemed rushed and distracted, which created some unpleasant anxiety for us.  As for the food, the Sidecar salad and the beet salad were delicious.  My mushroom risotto was, as I described at first bite, \"the best I've ever had,\" and that assessment still stands upon reflection.  My husband's salmon was perfectly adequate.  The dessert special was a goat cheese panna cotta with blueberry compote.  The texture was somewhere between cheesecake and ice cream, which is to say exquisite, if I may use such a word.  For a chocolate lover like me, it's rare to love a non-chocolate dessert so much.    The small hair in said dessert was... amusing.  As my husband commented, \"I guess some people would be really bothered by that.\"  Us, not so much.  It could happen to anyone.  But oddly I think  it might have been that little nudge that pushed us to the \"no\" side of the \"would we ever go back\" precipice.  We left feeling satisfied and happy, and none too poor for the experience, but there was something missing--the something that would get us to choose Sidecar over the hundred other restaurants a nine iron away from our house.  If they make the panna cotta a permanent item on the dessert menu, I might be persuaded to give it another shot.  NB: while described as on College \"at Bathurst\" Sidecar is actually three and a half decent blocks west of Bathurst, between Euclid and Manning.   A big difference if you're a local; maybe no so much if you just drove in from Milton."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night with my hubby without a reservation. They allowed us to sit at the bar. We had the bartender serve us and she was wonderful. She gave us some bubbly on the house! The complementary bread and hummus were delish! We shared the Caesar salad, I order the pasta with braised beef and my husband ordered the steak. All were well prepared, generous portions and very tasty. For dessert, we had the in-house creme brule - one of the best I have ever had. I will go back."}
{"text":"we went to sidecar bar and grill on a sunday eve for dinner while strolling along college street after my dinning partner and I were unable to get a table at bar raval. the place is cozy and modern. the friendly host greeted us immediately as soon as we walked in. they were finishing up with a large group so we opted to get drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. we both decided on the red sangria and we were not disappointed. after a few minutes at the bar, we were shown to our table. we decided to try their prix fixe menu. we placed our order with the host, whom i believe is also the owner. i decided on the soup/cavatelli/choco truffle while my partner had bitter greens/steak frites (extra$5)/choco truffle. i was very disappointed when my soup arrived. i had explained to the host that i am unable to digest cream and he had offered alternatives and replacements etc. when i placed my order so you can image my reaction to see my soup served with heavy cream poured on it. i didnt want to make a big fuss and wasnt planning to touch it. my dining partner noticed this immediately and offered to switch so i had his salad instead. the salad was delicious with the right among of dressing, the cavatelli was very flavourful and the truffle was super creamy and rich. while the restaurant and food are both fabulous it was a 3-star experience and evening at sidecar. our waitress was less than attentive. we had to flagged her down a couple of times throughout the evening and messing up the soup order was beyond careless, in my opinion. especially after so much time and effort was spent at ordering and the host knows that i am unable to process cream. was food good? yes! were we happy with the resto? yes! would i comeback? sure but sidecar is definitely NOT my choice for destination dinning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I organized a bachelorette party this weekend, and I had to change the time at the last minute, so we were moved upstairs. I was worried, since the website photos are of the first floor and the second is very different, but it's just gorgeous! Dark, with romantic lighting, the corner booths were great for a large party (12 people), and into the evening a stand up bass player with a pianist provided great mood music.   The drinks. We were here in part for the drinks. I tried a straight up drink for the first time and hated it (just too strong for me) - when I asked to mix it with some kind of pop, our excellent server (Kira) suggested I exchange it with another drink to suit my tastes. Off a few adjectives the bartender made me an Eagle's Dream, which blew my mind! So delicious. I think the bartender (Oliver) is psychic or something, he did this for another guest and she loved hers too.  The food was fantastic - I got steak and frites, which was everything I hoped. Two people I saw send back their steaks because they weren't cooked enough, one wanted it medium and the other well done. The steak pieces are VERY thick, so if you need your steak without red in it you should probably order something else. The refire didn't really work for my medium friend because of the thickness. For people who like medium rare or rarer it's just delicious, and cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and well seasoned, and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert was impressive. I wasn't expecting something so light - it tasted kind of like the inside of a lava cake, or a cross between cake and mousse. Very rich and chocolatey,  the guests were raving even though most of us were too full to finish!   We were there for ages, Kira quickly fixed a small error with our bill (just a mistake on the prix fixe cost), and our whole group had a delightful time. I highly recommend this place, and if your server is Kira you've lucked out!"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. Atmosphere was casual but refined. Service was friendly. In terms of my food order: 1. My appetizer order was mussels in a cream sauce. I'm pretty sure the sauce was seasoned with crack. Because I wanted to drink it. Or dip all of it with bread. I probably would've snorted it given the option. Thank god Rob Ford was still in rehab.   2. Mojito: my previous go-to for mojitos was at \"No One Writes to the Colonel\" which is conveniently also nearby. No longer. I can confidently tell you the mojitos at sidecar are better. But they cost more ($10) and are served in a tiny effeminate cylindrical glass. How I wish there was more quantity. Given the option, I would down three at least, but my wallet says otherwise.  3. Mains was a steak frites: the fries give the duck fat fries at Beer Bistro a run for its money. The steak was supposed to be medium rare but it looked more like medium. Nothing special. My coronary arteries probably won't thank me.   Overall a good place to check it. I'd have no hesitation coming back in the future."}
{"text":"I love Sidecar - the drink and the bar/restaurant.  Great place for dinner dates or just drinks at the bar.  It gets a bit crowded and I wish that they wouldn't book large groups.  It's too small of a space for a table of 8 or 10 people - just ruins it for everyone else in the place.  Service is great and the bartenders are actually cocktail connoisseurs."}
{"text":"We went here for a pseudo-anniversary dinner, you know, those milestones that you celebrate just for the sake of celebrating. We each had the oft-reviewed sidecar salad and it was delicious. I had the ravioli and ate all of it. My boyfriend had the steak frites and enjoyed it thoroughly. Also delicious was my fizz, yum, I loved the froth on top. We also devoured the warm bread. As also previously noted, the service was impeccable and warm."}
{"text":"Went for a bachelorette, and granted, we had an unwieldy party (we took up all the tables along the back wall). Had the prix fixe as a result, and a la carte drinks.  - Food  Sidecar salad Good, but nothing to write home about really. Reasonably small portion size, but that was fine with me because...  Steak frites Now that's a big hunk of juicy meat! Delicious, delicious meat :D Also, I asked if they could substitute something else for the frites (couldn't have anything deep fried that night), and was offered asparagus. Both were perfectly cooked (medium rare), and the steak was particularly scrumptious - nicely salted and appropriately cooked through, and quality of cut was good with very little to speak of in the way of chewy/cartilage-y bites.  Pumpkin tart I love pumpkin pie, which is what this almost was, minus the pie crust. Om nom nom...  - Service  Since I asked for a substitution, and was very pleasantly offered the asparagus, I'm inclined to say \"very good\". Only one issue, which could also be seen as a non-issue. Because of our group's size, they had to cut us into two bills. A friend paid for another girl's dinner, but didn't say anything to the waitress. It turned out the two ladies in question were on two different bills. Payment was all worked out in the end, and although I could fully understand the waitress' frustration at having to rework the billing because she wasn't fully aware of my friend having paid for part of the other bill, the waitress (albeit politely) told my friend not to do that in future, or to tell her (which I could have sworn my friend did, but whatevs). It seemed a bit like the poor waitress was worn out, and perhaps took some of her frustration out on my very pregnant, otherwise apologetic friend. It was just... very awkward, and somewhat unpleasantly handled.  Also, given that we were such a large group, many of us were guessing why our choices from the prix fixe weren't taken almost as soon as we sat down. We had to wait the better part of 45 minutes to have our orders taken - and although drinks had been brought, we weren't asked for a refill unless we flagged someone down.  - Price  Prix fixe, so no choice, but was very reasonable - I think it was $30, plus tax and tip (hard to pin point  - we were calculating costs associated with the entire night of revelry). I loved the steak!  - Atmosphere  On the nice-r side, but also still very casual - would be fine for any kind of dinner occasion I think, minus kids.  - Overall  Definitely not bad - steak was good enough that I'd be interested in coming back. With a lot of other stellar restaurants in the city, however, it doesn't exactly stick out in my mind... Except for juicy meat. I mentioned that, right? Steak.  Steak steak."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant.  The bread is especially nice and the price is fair.  Friends have said the steak frites are very good.  We had the salmon and it was done nicely.  I don't think they take risks, but the do things well I believe."}
{"text":"To add to Steven N.'s review (yes, I was the friend that ordered the shrimp fettuccine), my dish was \"off tasting\" in the sense that it had a raw-shrimp flavour to it. I usually try to finish my plate but I had to pass on this one.  The chocolate torte was decadent - it was a cross between fudge and mousse chocolate. The blueberry garnish on it was a nice touch to balance the sweetness."}
{"text":"I came here because the review on Yelp was good.  It lived up to my expectation.  The atmosphere was very nice, service was excellent, I would classify the service as \"professional.\"  I ordered the prix fixe menu (Sun - Wed only), which was great value.  I had chicken and a sort of romaine like salad appetizer thing.  Both were outstanding.  The dessert is chosen for you by the chef and that night we had flourless chocolate cake that was also really good but too rich for me, I couldn't finish it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly, professional staff; beautiful patio; wonderful.....chicken? I never order chicken and Sidecar is just one of those places where everything is so tasty that even the most boring-looking item on the menu ain't boring at all.  The real secret: From Sunday to Wednesday they run a Prix Fixe at the back of the menu which includes most of their top dishes for $24. Sidecar salad is incredibly fresh and so are the cocktails. Great, great place."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars and Service: 5 stars  I had dinner at Sidecar on Thursday (in November - this is a really delayed post) - the restaurant was pretty busy for a weekday night. The server took our coats and lead us to our table. I ordered steak frites which was accompanied with fries and the leafy greens. The steak was really tender and it was a great value (10oz steak, only for $19). However, the fries and the leafy greens I ordered was way too salty!! No, it wasn't my personal taste because I am usually that person who puts salt on pretty much everything.   So when our server asked about our food, I told her that my food was extremely salty. Then shortly after, the server brought out new salad and fries with complimentary dessert. The service here was excellent.    Yes, the food was too salty but I really couldn't have asked for a better service."}
{"text":"It was fantastic!!! The fixed price menu was so delicious and the wine was fantastic. I started out with the sidecar salad and for once there was some originality in a salad!!! It was delicious and so different from all the ho hum salads I have ordered in other Toronto restaurants. The salmon was cooked just right and melted in my mouth. My friend said her steak was cooked to perfection. The dessert was one of the best I have had in a very long time. The whole experience was excellent. The waiter was so nice....he even offered us coins for the parking meter in front. It was a real treat and best of all the price was very reasonable. Kudo's to the cook for thinking outside of the box and using a bit or originality!!!! It is a long way from my home and I usually don't go past Yonge Street but I will travel back to have dinner again!!!"}
{"text":"Six of us went out last night to dine on the beautiful Patio here.  As soon as we were seated , we were served water, bread with a Hummus dip. We ordered a variety of items from the menu. The beef carpaccio and shrimp tempura were fantastic. I had the pork chop. It was huge and cooked to perfection. Others has the seafood pasta and risotto dishes. Everyone enjoyed their meal. It was also nice that there was no tip,as it was already Factored into the price.  We will definitely return the next time in TORONTO."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Everything we ate was fantastic. Great ambience. Unfortunately the service was awful. Though it was a busy Saturday night, our server forgot about us. Too bad -- great food but poor service left a bad taste in our mouth."}
{"text":"This was a solid meal.  If you are looking for a restaurant that feels nicer than just a pub or whatnot, but not pretentious....this is it. Its adorable and the staff is super nice, taking your coat and everything.  The service was great. Not a moment went by without our water glasses not being full and she was never too far away for questions etc.  The food was good. It wasn't amazing. It wasn't showy. So if you want super fancy food or food that makes you say \"wow i've never had that before!\" dont come here.  If you want homey food, cooked skillfully, this is your restaurant. My chicken was juicy and crispy with a really nice gravy. My husbands crab risotto was a really nice consistency with good flavours. Spicy and creamy together. And if you don't try anything else....GET THOSE FRITTERS! Man oh man those were good.  I wouldn't go back....but I would recommend it to others :)"}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly staff, good drinks. Not impressed with the food. The steak was very dry. The worst was the service time. It should not take 3.5 hours to serve a 3 course meal to 10ppl and 3 attempts to get the bill right."}
{"text":"A disappointing dining experience. My wife and I both had a pasta dish, the parpadella and the rigatoni. What we got on our plates was overcooked  pasta with little or no taste (pasta not even close to al dente). I left the place hungry. Stick to the steak-frites or prix fix as they get great feedback in other reviews. Great alternatives within walking distance though..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. The steak frites are one of my favourites. Their sidecar salad is quite food also. I hope they bring back the apple or peach cobbler. It was the best dessert."}
{"text":"Good quality, acceptable portions, good service, nice ambiance, ok pricing.  Despite it not being busy, was seated at a cramped table next to the service door to the private club upstairs which meant being literally bumped and interrupted every 5 minutes.  Not the 1st time this has happened..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening for my sisters bday, we were a party of 5.  The service is over the top!  We asked for sangria which they did not have as it takes 24 hours to prepare. We received a rum punch on the house along with an amuse bouche.   We all went with the prixe fix menu which is only $25 for a perfect portion, delicious meal.  We were even able to substitute for the baby kale & pear salad as opposed to the ones on the prixe fix, very accommodating!  My orecchiette was delicious, along with the salad, chocolate ganache dessert and macchiato.  I will definitely be back and will be  recommending this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service. Great atmosphere.  Sidecar salad was fantastic.  Pan sear black cod was bland - would not order that again. Had a bite of the steak . . .  should have ordered that . . .  Dessert and coffee were delicious.  Would go back again just would not order the cod, but if my main sucks again . . . will have to change my rating."}
{"text":"Two words. Free. Bread.  Seriously though this place is awesome. Friendly staff, delicious food and a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our first and only time eating dinner at Sidecar.  The service was perfectly fine, no problems in that respect.  The food was so bland and boring.  I was part of a group of 4 people, we all ordered something different and not one meal stood out as anything special.    They sat us on the back patio.  The only lighting was individual candles on the tables.  We couldn't see our food at all.  We asked for another candle and still, it was way to dark out to see what you were cutting and eating.  There are way to many choices in this city, why eat here?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner, but only ended up staying for a few very well crafted cocktails. The reason?  The risotto, pasta and other amazing sounding dishes were reminiscent of something I want to eat in January, not in July.  So, maybe Side Car will add some lighter, seasonal summer fare to their menu, or I will be back come January."}
{"text":"Our waitress was excellent, when the order arrived wrong she went above and beyond to rectify it. She was very attentive and gave frequent refills. The restaurant was homey, rustic, and romantic with a candle for every table. The seats in the back were a bit drafty but the food made up for it. Compliments to the chef! We were there for Winterlicious and the dishes were excellent. I recommend the steak and the calamari. Delicious dip and the steak is cut with mouthwatering precision.   If I could give the experience six stars I would!"}
{"text":"After so many rave reviews on Yelp, I couldn't leave Toronto without going to Sidecar. I'm glad I did, but wasn't blown away.   We got there around 7:15pm and the place was empty. The maitre'd sat us at the front but asked us \"will you be gone by 8:30?\", which, while I understand he was fitting us in, thought it was an odd question (read: rude.) It would have felt better had he just said \"We're glad you chose us for dinner. I'm happy to seat you here, but just to make you aware, we have reservations for this table at 8:30\" or something like that. /rant  The waiter (who's name I didn't catch) literally had nothing good to say about the menu. Every time I asked about a dish, he was so ambivalent about it that I was nervous about eating anything. I thought that was odd since it's more of a fine dining atmosphere.   Drinks: I had the \"Colonial Bramble\" (gin, lime, maple syrup, cointreau), which was served over crushed ice and simply delicious! I've been craving one since I left. My friend had the Sidecar, which I tasted and was also delicious. Sidecar cocktails, ftw!  Food: I started with the Roasted Beet salad. It was okay. The beets were a little tough and I had trouble cutting them with my butter knife. It lacked flavour, imo. After waffling over the roasted chicken or risotto, I settled on the ravioli. It was unappealing to look at (the colours were not at all vibrant), but it was very pleasing on my palate. The italian cheese, porchetta and green apple mixed together well, and the ravioli was clearly home made. It was good. My friend had the cauliflower risotto, which was also very good. Because we had to leave by 8:30, and because the service was sloooow in the typical Toronto fashion, we didn't have time for dessert. Or another cocktail, for that matter, which was probably the biggest shame of them all!  The cocktails were so good that, were I to be living in Toronto longer, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"High class ambiance, service and food without the hefty price tag. Dinners are candlelit, servers replace your cutlery after each course, and the bread is always served warm and toasty. Lot of middle eastern influence. They serve a nice hummus spread instead of butter with their bread, and their signature Sidecar Salad has middle eastern flavor as well. A beautiful place for a romantic yet reasonabltly priced date (whether with a loved one or a friend), with fail-proof food. Their portions are small, but there are definitely places that charge triple the $ and give a third of the amount."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great drinks and great patio. Kick in the pants was a favorite :)"}
{"text":"It is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Toronto lately. The service was great from the minute I walked in the door. Their back patio is really cute, though the tables are a tad too close to each other. The food and cocktails were delicious. For drinks I had a Derby and a Gimlet and both were very good. For the appetizer my date and I had the Carpaccio, which was very yummy and for the entre I had the Steak Frites while my date had the Duck Confit Gnocchi. Both were outstanding! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had a great meal in the bar upstairs. Ask the bartender for a basil smash. If it's the guy who made me one, you're in for a treat. I ate the steak frites and loved it.  My second meal was a mediocre experience on the patio but I'm still pretending that didn't happen so I'm sticking with my 5 star."}
{"text":"Went here for a buddy's birthday last week. There were 11 of us and the servers and staff were very tolerant and accommodating of our group's volume level and general excitedness. We ate really well and the spot was bumping. The sidecar cocktail was delicious."}
{"text":"I tried the\"Badass Mojito\" - good, but overpriced at $13. The prix fix menu at $25 dollars for the Sidecar Salad, Steak Frites and Flourless chocolate cake (more like a small brownie cut into triangles) was tasty, but average; portion sizes were on the small side, but to be expected for the low price. Overall, good value for money, left satisfied. Dining on the patio was the best part - it is well taken care of, and a nice place to unwind after a long days work. Staff were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE cocktail and dinner restaurant*  Dinner: This is a real \"sit down restaurant\" where you can truly enjoy the atmosphere, savour your dinner and enjoy a wonderfully made cocktail. You aren't rushed out the door like most restaurants! Servers arrive precisely and intentionally when they mean too. Service is always friendly and accomodating. All around food and affordability is awesome.   Cocktails:  You have to try the BADASS MOJITO!!! New to the game, try something new and ask your server to recommend a cocktail."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best prie fix menu. Had the argula salad which was delicious and a huge portion size. Then the steak fries. The steak was perfectly done, super moist and tender. Desserts was the chocolate flourless cake. I could have done without it. Tasted like spooning pure chocolate. Not a huge fan. Overall a exceptional meal for $25."}
{"text":"Been more often then I should admit because I'm constantly introducing people to my favourite College st find. Service can be hit or miss (oftentimes too attentive), but the food is perfect. And I swear the prices are the best on the block."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable prix-fixe menu.  Top it off with a great cocktail.  They make a mean Sidecar, and a pretty good Mojito too, just don't be in a rush to get your drink.  The bartenders know what they are doing here, and take their time.  Good food and drinks with a lot of style!"}
{"text":"I went to Sidecar on a Monday evening to take advantage of their prix fix menu with three other people.  We arrived at 8 with no reservations and were quickly given a table, had our coats taken, and offered drinks.  Service throughout the whole night was excellent, our server was attentive, able to explain the dishes, friendly, and did not intrude into our meal at all.    Having the three course prix fix our plates were brought out with perfect timing.  The food itself was tasty and hot.  The prix fix menu gives you three options for appetizer (2 salads, 1 soup) four options for main (fish, pasta, chicken, beef) and chefs choice for dessert (consideration given for nut allergy).    Overall, between the four of us we got an assortment of food and everyone enjoyed their dish.  This restaurant also made you feel like you were getting great value for your money, as the prix fix is a really good deal.  Drinks were also excellent and creative.  Restaurant was also quite full and had a nice ambiance where the four of us had a great evening and would not only return but recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Sidecar is primarily a restaurant[1] but even Mormons will be hard pressed to ignore the liquid portion of the menu. Whoever is creating the drinks has put exquisite care into selecting the best ingredients--in the right proportions--taking the time to infuse mixers and make garnishes in house. Even their choices of glassware, stemware and often-overlooked minutiae like a cocktail pick reveal the kind of OCD that elevates a drink from good to extraordinary.  The Manhattan ($10) is served in a massive old-fashioned glass over a chunk of ice the size of a Rubik's cube, keeping the drink chilled without diluting the flavor too quickly. The combination of rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters went down smoothly and better than most boyfriends I've had. This is easily the best Manhattan in all of Toronto (even better than the one at The Black Hoof) and in serious competition for the best Manhattan I've ever had anywhere. It's garnished with Sidecar's own macerated black cherry, foregoing the usual sickly-sweet maraschino cherry that so often ruins the cocktail for me.  I sampled some of the other cocktails, too. The Painless Brazilian is a pink confection of strawberry cachaca blended with lime and coronated with a frothy egg-white crown. The dainty Champagne coupe it comes in evokes a demure past era even as the name reminds me of horrific lady business. I normally don't like frou-frou girly drinks, but this is the rare one that didn't induce a diabetic coma.  The Vesper, on the other hand, is a serious drinker's drink. There's nothing to mask the potent combination of Lillet, gin, vodka; just a fresh lemon spiral in the stemmed glass that will transport you to a lemon grove with one whiff.  So impressed was I by the cocktails that when the mixologist behind the bar came over to deliver another drink, I felt compelled to lead our table of 12 Yelpers (or was it 14?) in a round of applause. Yes, they were THAT good.  Tipples in this town are expensive, so I appreciate that the cocktails at Sidecar have been crafted with respect for the ingredients and respect for the drinker. I'll be back.  ======================== [1] I have yet to try the food so this review is just for the drinks."}
{"text":"Another great room with a kitchen and service staff who know what they are doing. If you don't order a cocktail to start your meal here you are missing out. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Key Points:  Food: 10/10 delicious. Portions were so on point!  Service: 10/10 absolutley outstanding. I could not have had a better experience! Duff (our server) was so fantastic.  Atmosphere: intimate, there were maybe 50-60 people inside. Lights were dim, music quiet but bluesy/jazzy   My boyfriend chose Sidecar out of the blue, neither of us had been there before. Location is on College, on the south side, just west of Bathurst. (Beside Burrito Boys)  We were welcomed inside, had our jackets taken, and were escorted to our seats. Our AMAZING server came around with water and our wine/dinner menus. I had a glass of Rosé and my boyfriend had a bottle Hoegarden.  The entire menu is great. There is enough choice, without being overwhelmed. There is a prix fixe meny Sunday - Wednesday for an app, main, and dessert for $25.  For appetizers, I had romaine hearts with bacon, shaved parmesean cheese and a crostini with a lemon zest spread. My boyfriend had a huge selection of chili seasoned olives, (which he ended up taking home because there were so many)  Our mains were stuffed ravioli (veal, beef and pork) in a tomato sauce. YUM and my boyfriend had a mushroom risotto. The flavoring was so rich and tasty!  By the time dessert was ready we were pretty full, as there was also a mini basket of fresh breads and butter (one baguette had flavorings of dill!!!!)  We ended up sharing the apple fritter. This was amazing. There were 4 lightly fried apple fritters. They were placed on top of an apple puree and were powdered in a cinnamon sprinkle. On the side was a dish of 100% maple syrup. Oh, and they were FRESH, made to order.  Because we were the last couple in there still eating, and enjoying our time, our server was so kind to come around with two glasses of port, on the house.   I 100% recommend this place to couples who wish to have a nice dinner during the week or a group of 6 - 8 friends for a birthday outing or special occasion.  Pricing: Our bill came to aprox $80 (including tax, not including tip) For two apps, two mains, a dessert, two beers and a glass of wine. I'd say that was extremly worth it"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Fun dates place. Try the Atlantic Salmon and Mushroom Risotto. great and reasonable wine options"}
{"text":"I went to Sidecar for a birthday dinner a few months ago and it was decent, not spectacular. The food was essentially typical bistro French style cuisine and I thought it was a tad overpriced for what we got: risotto, salmon... The service was pretty decent. Cool vibe in the place except a nasty back door that staff kept slamming shut or leaving open much to our demise. brrrr.....drafty. I'd got there again for a birthday or special occasion if I was invited but not likely choose Sidecar as a hang out for drinks or dinner. ."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious with another couple. The service was top notch and the food was even better. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and would come back here again."}
{"text":"Sidecar is everything Toronto to me from the waiters to the clientele to the clean decor.  When our bill came and the drink bill was on par with the food bill, I nodded my head and thought, \"I feel a great balance here\".  Dinner for two with the fixed price menu and two drinks apiece came to $120 or so.  Let's talk about their cocktails.  Yum!  Their cocktails were yum!  Their Badass Mojito was mixed together with raspberries and though fruity; had a delicious sourness to it.  And the Manhattan was, as Susan C. put it, \"better than most boyfriends I've had\".    From Sunday to Wednesday they offer a fixed price menu of appetizer, main course, and dessert.  The food was tasty and well-prepared and normally I'm not a dessert person but I could not leave a crumb of my flourless chocolate cake on my plate.  So I succumbed to its flourless-chocolateness (that's a mouthful) and licked my plate clean despite my opposing full stomach.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Everything is house made, however we did not leave there full.  The portions are small.  My husband ordered the ravioli and he literally got 7 of them.  That being said, the pasta was properly made and cooked, we just wish we got a little bit more of it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. It wasn't planned. The plc we were going to go to, didn't work out so we decided on sidecar last minute and boy was it last minute. I had suggested giving there a try as I had remembered Kris U. Loving it and his awesome review! So we went late and don't think staff were happy at first because of us arriving close to kitchen closing. Nonetheless, they ended up still giving pretty good service. Overall, we were happy with what we all ordered. Some of the dishes ordered were the papardelle with braised short ribs, aged cheddar, king oyster, mushrooms, San Marzano tomato sauce, Spanish onion. The Cassoulet-duck confit leg, crispy braised pork belly, sausage, white beans (beans could have been cooked a little more). I had the traditional ravioli with veal, pork and beef filling. Those were some of the dishes ordered. I had a taste of all and all were great. Oh and can't forget the amazing bufula mozzarella that Kris U mentioned. Soooo good! I will definitely be back this summer to try their patio!  Judging from their photos, it looks really nice!"}
{"text":"After months of searching for a venue, my fiancé and I decided to have our engagement party at Sidecar last weekend because we enjoyed it so much last couple times we've dined there. Casey and the staff especially Jen, were amazing! They took care of us and made sure everything went off without a hitch! That's  not easy to do as there were 27 of us.   We were seated in the rear area of the restaurant by the kitchen which was able to accommodate all 27 of us. It was romantic and intimate just the way we pictured it would be.   The food of course was exceptional. I had the salmon with white wine butter sauce and it was delicious. My family could not stop raving about the food. Everyone scarfed down their food before  I could even take a picture!   Thanks again for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town for drinks and dinner. Both times I was there I had the risotto, amazing creamy risotto. A few of us ordered that and when it was all said and done there wasn't a spec of risotto left on our plates. The drinks are strong and flavourful. My favourite is their Jerry sour. Amazing service from the wait staff. On my list of restaurants I would take my out-of-town friends to. I wish it was in my neck of the woods, I would go there every week."}
{"text":"This place is always packed no matter what night of the week it is every time I pass by. You HAVE to make reservations for this place in advance. I tried to get a table on a Tuesday night at 7 and they didn't have any open tables 'til 9, and we ended up elsewhere that night.  That being said, the food and service is excellent. I'm not a fan of strong boozey drinks but that Badass Mojito was pretty fucking awesome, they're not stingy with the mint which I like. Yellowfin (Ahi) Tuna appetizer was really tasty, I'd order it again if I didn't go with a prix fixe menu. The duck confit on turnip and sausage risotto was okay, the risotto was a bit lumpy and a bit too al dente for my liking.   I've also had the steak frites with spicy smoked mayonaise. Excellent sirloin, well seasoned and well cooked, no gristle. The fries are thin cut and crispy, full of spicy smoky flavour that they don't really need that mayo on the side.   Great food, excellent service, nice ambiance. Would definitely go again.   ------------------------ Update: January 2010 -------------------------  So now I've been there a few more times. Candy Ass (virgin)  Mojito is delicious, the service is still wonderful, but the food is not tasting so mindblastingly good any more. Steak of late has been gristly and flavourless, the Atlantic Salmon gave me an awful bout of the runs, (possibly because it was undercooked) and I'm getting sick of getting the Chef's Choice of flourless chocolate cake fudge everytime for dessert with the prix fixe menu."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant where I'm confused by the reviews and this is based on going here twice.  A year ago, we came here for dinner and there were 4 of us and they messed up the doneness of the steak not once, but twice.  So by the time 3 of us were done our meal, the 4th person was still waiting for the entree.  In response to this, which I do give them excellent marks for, they gave us certificates to come back which we did recently.  Unfortunately, we ran into the same problem.  Luckily, my steak was done correctly but my friend's salmon was undercooked (it was basically sashimi in the middle.  The value is definitely here for the 3 course fixed price menu.  The portions are enormous for the cost, the food is okay tasting.  Decor, it is quite dark which is not something I understand.  The candle for some reason is out in the open, so you can light things accidentally pretty easily.  I won't be making a third trip back here."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, food is very good, amazing Malbec wine, I've got nothing bad to say about this place. The prices are also very reasonable.   I would highly recommend this resto"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, wait was reasonable and we got a private table by the window. The bad, the private table is by the entrance to the new downstairs expansion so it was very high traffic. The food was not at the same level as a year ago. We order the crab cakes, very good but very over prices. I ordered the steak frits and wife had the duck confit (new menu item). It took 40 minutes to get our food. The steak arrived cold (room temperature), I had to send it back twice to get it at the proper temperature (and it ended up overcooked, they should have just done a new one). The frits were inedible, it was like someone opened a container of salt on them. The duck confit was good, nice and tender but to lean for this sort of dish. The lentils were good but again to salty. I really wanted to love coming back but it has gone down in my books. I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"If you're looking to spend a little extra on dinner without blowing your food budget, Sidecar is a great option.  On my recent visit I had the Atlantic Salmon with swiss chard, honey mustard glaze, and butter sauce. The portion-size was ideal (I'm not one for typical North American feasts), the fish was cooked to perfection, and the glaze was subtle and delicious. If you're not a fan of sweet accents, I would suggest the steak frites, which I can guarantee is the most-ordered menu item.  Apart from the food, Sidecar is a cocktail connoisseur's wet dream. The bartender is a mixology expert and has put together a cocktail menu that will make your head spin (especially after you've had 3 or 4). On my last two visits I've had The Saratoga, served with an ice cube that's about 50% the volume of the glass. My nerdy friend explained why :  Larger ice cube = Less surface area = Doesn't melt as quickly  They think of everything, don't they?  As long as it's not the dead of winter, make sure you get a seat on the back patio. It's a quiet, garden patio with cedar tables and chairs. Heat lamps are turned on during cool nights and blankets are available upon request.  Note 1: The prix fixe is a great price ($25) and includes the steak frites option as a main, but is only available Sunday through Wednesday"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the city. Great service and very good food. It is a bit small, so ensure you book a table in advance. I was there twice and each time they didnt have few of the wonderful things in the menu. I enjoyed eating there with few friends"}
{"text":"Let's be clear: you go to Sidecar for the cocktails.  The food is all around good, with several strong showings on the menu, especially in the soups and seafood categories. Steak frites are a dependable winner, as are the soups.  But let's not mince words: you go to Sidecar for the cocktails. They are incredible, and made with care and love. Ice is shaped appropriately for the glass. The list is misleading - the barmen will make what you want. I recommend the Sazerac, The Old Fashioned, and oh my, the Bad Ass Mojito. I recommend finding something interesting and expanding your horizons.  You go to Sidecar for the cocktails."}
{"text":"*Ambiance* Restaurant and bar are warmly decorated. I was impressed this being my first time to Sidecar. There's a small bar where you could come for a drink in addition to the dining area. The décor is very nice and warm and inviting. I enjoyed it very much. Definitely come here for a first date if you want to impress and get cozy. It's very nice inside. Google for some photos of the restaurant, you'll see what I mean.   There's apparently a really beautiful back patio but it was winter and it was closed; again google.  I overheard that there was no hot water in the men's room. That would be a bummer when washing your hands in the winter.  The restaurant is very clean.  *Service* The service at Sidecar was very good. We were greeted by the friendly bartender as we walked into the door and were offered for our jackets to be taken and stored during our meal (no coat check charge). Very nice. I had reservations and we were offered to sit at any vacant table of our choice (we were escorted, not just left to roam). The table/chairs were pulled out for us to sit and get comfortable.   Table/silverware/plates were all clean and water and bread w/ butter was brought out to us promptly and cocktail orders were taken. Waitress was friendly and sweet and not pretentious/bad attitude as typical of Toronto. She accommodated my substitution request with no problem and was very attentive during our meal.  The bartender was fast with orders and personally brought everything out that he made and made sure the cocktails were mixed to our liking. More on this later.  *Food* The food here is excellent. They make a point on the menu that everything is made in house: from the bread on the table, sauces, to the dessert (lots of places contract this one out). Bread was excellent; you get two different types.  We had the:  romaine hearts - lightly dressed (perfectly) not to over power. Dressing was halfway between a vinaigrette and cream Caesar dressing (excellent). Real thick cuts of bacon in the salad was a welcome change from died bacon crumble. 5/5  top sirloin with mashed potatoes - The meal comes with sea salted fries but I asked to substituted for mashed potatoes (no problem from waitress, no fuss, no surcharge). I thought I'd take a chance and have the steak (I'm particular). Steak was cooked perfectly to order and was very flavourful. I'd trust them with my steak again. Mashed potatoes were light, fluffy, and were seasoned for much flavour (couldn't believe how good they were). Plating was simple and clean. 5/5  tiramisu - I had the price fixe and this was the desert of the day. I don't really like tiramisu but thought id go for it. This was perfect. Nice portion with a thick rich chocolaty base with a light coffee flavour in the middle part of the cake. The cake was firm and not mushy/liquidity like most. Perfect! 5/5  mussels - wife had these. She liked them a lot and had a big smile on her face. I didn't have any so I can't comment on the flavour (looked delicious).You got a good amount of mussels as well for the price.   Spicy shrimp risotto - Wife's entrée (I sampled) Excellent. Rich and thick. Lots of  shrimp (they didn't cheap out). Flavour was excellent, the rice cooked perfectly but I wouldn't consider this hot-spicy. Maybe a little heat. Im definitely not knocking it as its flavour was great; it's just seasoned for our Canadian palettes so if you can handle the heat maybe ask to make it extra spicy. Wife was very very happy with this.  *Cocktails* There's a cocktail section in the menu with about 12 different cocktails + beer + wine etc. The bartender that was working the night I went (nice guy) was solid. The cocktails and they were mixed excellently. He came over and chatted a bit about cocktails with me when he brought our second round out. He knew his stuff and was very friendly about it.   I'm particular about my drink and the Derby, Sidecar and Grapefruit Gimlet that I ordered were all perfect; the Derby being the best Derby I've ever had. I would come back to sit at the bar for just cocktails. They run $10 apiece.   *Summary* Great restaurant and bar. Very nice inside and is most reasonably priced for the ambience, food quality and service. Probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in Toronto. I couldn't find a fault. Definitely coming back and definitely taking people here when I'm trying to impress.    Tip: Price Fixe menu is available Sunday-Wednesday and for $25 you get a choice of 1 of 3 apps, 1 of 3 mains (steak being one) and a fresh daily desert (I had tiramisu, ymmv). For such a nice restaurant I think this is incredible value."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I've been numerous times and am consistently impressed by both the service and food.  The glorious food starts right from the homemade bread, which would eventually have me question why Woodlot's bread was so popular.  Sidecar's homemade bread offerings were buttery and delicious with a perfect texture.    The cocktails on their own are worth phoning home about.  I would highly recommend the \"Kick in the Pants\" for an after-a-long-work-day starter beverage.  For apps the buffalo mozzerella, a fairly typically dish, is stand-out delicious and amazingly fresh.  The oysters have also been top notch.  As for mains, I've had the tagliatelle (stand out dish), chicken, salmon and haddock and would recommend all of them thoroughly and in that order.    The best part about this place is that it is light on the wallet.  You come out feeling satisfied and that you've somehow gotten the deal of the century given the amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious after seeing that it had a lot of really good reviews on yelp ... This was one of the few times that I disagree with the rating!  I thought our meal was just okay. Maybe it's because it was winterlicious and their regular menu offerings are better. Who knows, but I wouldn't go back to see. The service was good for the most part, although it did take some time for the server to take our orders. The bread and hummus dip to start is delicious, as others have stated. The arugula salad and fried calamari were good.  The striploin was not the best quality. It was also under-cooked just a bit, though my friend's was cooked perfectly. I thought the main entree was a small serving size. The creme caramel was terrible - the texture was way off, it was pretty clumpy and had a heavy/hard texture. The new york cheesecake with the salted caramel topping was good. This restaurant was just average to me, as nothing really stood out or wowed me. It was comparable to the many other restaurants on College."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there tonight for the first time based on all the positive Yelp reviews.  We had early reservations for 6:30 pm otherwise the other seatings were 9 or 10 or so.  Book on line in advance.  We got seated right away, and as it was a gorgeous evening we sat on their back patio which was really nice.  What we ordered:  Drinks: \"The Sidecar\"  Really strong and really good!  Appetizers:  1)  Buffalo Mozzarella:  Save your money on this one, it is a small blob of of cheese and cheap mortadella, I mean seriously??? Mortadella?  How about some nice salami or something?  2)  The duck confit poutine:  Salty but delicious!  Mains:  Steak Frites:  It was really yummy and done to my liking, the fries were thin and crispy and the sauce on the side was really yummy too.  Risotto:  Ok, but we definitely have had better.  The breads they served were really, really good.  I believe they are baked fresh on premises daily.  Our server even asks if we wanted another round of bread.  Service:  VERY attentive!  Our waters were never empty, our dirty dishes were cleared quickly without being rushed.  All in all it was a really nice dinner and a nice ambiance.  We would definitely go back.  FYI:  Looking around the restaurant, we noticed that a lot of people ordered the Steak Frites, so that may be a good option if you're going for the first time.  Dessert:  As College Street has so many places for something sweet we chose to go down the street to Dolce :)"}
{"text":"On the plus side, the service was fantastic! The apps were fabulous, however the food took a while to come (like an hour), for which the server / manager were very apologetic and made it right as rain by buying us a round of drinks!   My main course was on the smaller side, which I am never a fan of. Over all, I'd say worth checking out, especially because they have a really cute back patio. I would like to go back to try the fixed menu that runs sun - weds (i think)."}
{"text":"Food was good, dessert was terrible, and service absolutely awful.  I went there last year and service was terrible and decided to give it a second try - shouldn't have.  Went twice in one week with out of town guests - once on a weeknight, once on a Saturday - waited forever for our food.  On the Saturday night, we waited an hour just to get our appetizers and then another half hour to get dinner.  We left without getting our dessert because it was taking so long.  The first time the dessert had been ruined anyway - they came out and told us that the souffle had fallen and then brought us the souffle as pudding!!!  The entrees were delicious, but not worth the terrible and slow service to me.  And they weren't apologetic at all.  I get that it was really busy when we were there, but you think they'd be staffed for that!  It was a mistake to go back."}
{"text":"Sidecar is definitely a hidden gem in this city. My fiancé and I discovered it a few years ago and it's our go-to nicer dinner out now. We never go without a reservation, and it's usually pretty full, so I'd suggest making one unless you feel like eating at the bar.  We were there this past weekend and as per usual were greeted at the front door. Our table was ready when we got there and we were given our pick of a couple of open tables (love when restaurants do that!) The food was as good as always. We've tried quite a few things on their menu and never been disappointed with anything. Our most-ordered foods are probably oysters, which are always really fresh and nicely sized; the cheese plate; which is huge for the cost and always served with a nice variety of bread and jams; the steak frites; a nice portion and has always been done exactly to my fiancé's liking and the salmon on kale; I never stray from this. The salmon piece is always really large and the greens are a perfect accent. My fiancée is also a really big fan of the duck. We've only ever has impeccable service there, and I'm a former waitress, so I'm quite picky about service. The servers seem to know when to sit back and let us enjoy our meal, but we never have to wait for anything, either.  For the type of food their serving, the prices can't be beat. And though we usually go on a weekend, the Sun-Thurs prix fix meals have great choices and are even better priced.  All in all, great date spot! And it doesn't hurt that Eat My Martini is across the street if you want to continue your night out!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after reading all the great reviews and the fact that gratuity is incorporated into the prices is a fantastic step in the right direction, but the food was nothing special and the service left a lot to be desired.  I came here with 8 other people and we were seated in the back patio, which was lovely. A few of us decided to share a bottle of sparkling wine. The wine itself was great, but the server spilled on every pour (not a huge deal) and then proceeded to leave the bottle over by the cash register in the hot sun, no ice bucket. When he finally came back to refill our glasses he emptied the warm bubbly into 2 glasses that still had wine instead of the ones that didn't. Our other waiter was not any better. One person in our group asked if they had a garlic aioli instead of sriracha and was told, \"I don't know.\" That's was ok, but when she was asked the next time she said, \"I forgot to check.\" and the third time it went back to \"I don't know, but I don't think so.\" When someone wanted a sweet, fruity cocktail and asked for a recommendation the answer again was, \"oh, I'm not really sure.\"  Service was also extremely slow. I know we were a larger group, but we all ordered from the prix fixe menu except for 1 person. It should not have taken 4 hours.   When the food did arrive it was average at best. The Caesar salad at Loblaws is better. The steak, which was supposed to be medium-rare, was kind of medium-well if you used your imagination. Most of it was fully cooked through.   Overall a very disappointing experience. It's a good thing gratuity is included in the prices because quite honestly I don't know if I would have left much of a tip. Maybe they are better with smaller groups, but I certainly will not be going back or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm giving this review a mid-range star rating because the food was superb (as always) but the drinks have always been quite awful.  You'd think an establishment of this caliber would be able to make a decent martini. Some things for Sidecar's bartender(s) to note:  * Dry martini = little vermouth * Dirty martini = lots of vermouth * Martinis are served in martini glasses - not tiny aperitif glasses * Lemon twist, no olives = delicate twist of lemon peel (not a big honking chunk) and no olives at all whatsoever"}
{"text":"My boyfriend treated me to dinner here (for my birthday) and I absolutely loved it! We were greeted by a nice young gentleman who kindly offered to take our coats, guide us to our table and take our drink orders (I ordered the Cucumber Caesar; which was a refreshing version of the traditional Caesar) -- while we peruse the menu.   We started with the Freshly Shucked Oysters and Bufula Mozzarella. Just thinking about the oysters is making me salivate. They were so fresh and large in portion. As for the Bufula Mozzarella, the salad dressing was delish!  For our main, I ordered the Crispy Oven Roasted Chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites. The broth is quite salty, but I devoured it nonetheless. The chicken was so tender, but the skin was surprisingly crispy! I thought it was the perfect portion to satiate my appetite. In addition, the cute little mushrooms in the dish were packed with the broth - super yummy! My boyfriend loved the aioli sauce that accompanied the Steak Frites. His only complaint was that his steak was a little cold, but apart from this -- it was cooked to perfection!  Then we ordered dessert. The Flourless Chocolate Cake and the Apple Raisin Cheddar Fritters. Probably not my favourite part of our meal (even though I am a sucker for chocolate anything)! I think it had more to do with the fact that we were both extremely full from appetizers and our mains, that it was difficult to fit in dessert (our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs).  I'd return to this restaurant for sure! I think the next time we go, we might ease up on all the appetizers and just order one. We had no idea that they offer fresh bread (that's really addictive) with homemade butter.   Make sure to make reservations ahead of time. This place will be busy for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Very nice ambiance in the upstairs \"Toronto Temperance Society\", so if they offer a space to you there, its definitely worthwhile, with dim lighting and a few very nice booths.  However, service left much to be desired. Could have been an aberration, so its worth a shot."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment with the intention of a good meal.  This is what I found there.  I enjoyed a Prix Fixe, 22$, including a salad consisting of chopped vegetables, cheese, and dressing.  This was followed by an enjoyable beefsteak, cooked to medium rare, and served with long, thin, fried potatoes.  Enjoyable.  The dessert was a combination of chocolate and cream, a flourless chocolate cake.  As a man who enjoys the finer things in life, I ordered an old fashioned, a cocktail i imbibed during my youth, and found it to be more than satisfactory.  A fine experience, including the dessert!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekend for dinner and it was really busy, reservations are a must.   I ordered the risotto and it came out perfectly. What surprised me about this place is how well priced it the food is! Not to leave out, the service was quite good.   Took away one star because the seating is a little cramped but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal at Sidecar. (Fresh Raw Oysters, Steaks, a Bottle of Malbec, and Brownie for dessert). The steaks were cooked to perfection and the oysters were amazing and came with a delicious house made hot-sauce.   The only downside was our server, (otherwise I'd give it 5 stars). She was really unhelpful and had no personality (bob-hair-cut girl). I asked about the brownie for dessert because I wasn't sure about it and all she said was \"It's good\"... I rephrased and asked for details and she gave me some serious attitude and just repeated \"it's good\". Although the brownie would delight some taste buds, had my server been more helpful and knowledgeable she would have steered ME away from it. Sour citrus and chocolate are not to my personal taste.   Aside from her service, the food was exceptional and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came back!  I took my parents here for my dad's birthday in early August.  We all got the prix fix menu. My dad loved the steak and my mom really enjoyed the fish. They didn't like the soup though.  But it was still a good experienced, like I remembered!"}
{"text":"Second time to Sidecar in a few weeks- and it was very enjoyable.  +Patio = win +Steak frites = win +location=win +interior = win   -risotto = risotto sucks can't blame sidecar -Astica on the wine list (isn't this a 7 dollar bottle of wine we used to chug in high school?) -server had personality of snail, possibly just didn't like my verbose second base stories -clientèle = sort of a lot of old bags hanging around. kind of a buzz kill."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place so made a reservation for my birthday. It took a little while for the party at our table to leave, so we had to wait about 15 mins past the reserved time, but that's my only complaint.  The service was fine and the food was mighty tasty. A few of us had the set course menu which had very nice options. The desserts were especially incredible - I'd recommend sharing as the portions are larger than expected."}
{"text":"I'm so angry at myself. This place combines two of my favourite things: duck confit and lightly pan-fried gnocchi. So what do I order? Pappardelle.  I brought my best friend here for her birthday. She ordered the gnocchi so I thought to order something else so we can both try each other's dishes. It ended up being her pushing me to eat more gnocchi because she could see the envy in my eyes, I think. But alas, I refused because I must forever remember this and always choose the duck confit.  Anyways, the ambiance was good. It was cold for June but we got a patio seat in the back. Atmosphere was crisp and classy. Service could be a little more attentive but I understand that they saw that we were in deep conversation and didn't want to intrude. We both ordered the beef carpaccio to start and it's one of the best I've had to this day. Jess and I still talk about it sometimes."}
{"text":"Made some resos here the other week - took my best friend for birthday dinner. Charming atmosphere. Excellent service from the minute we walked in. Ordered the steak frites - simply amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection. Better than Goods & Provisions in my opinion. Would definitely recommend. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance in their back patio in the summer!! Best in town ;)  Food was great!  Tip and service fee is included in all their prices!  I would definitely go back again :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice and have full confidence in coming back here for a casual outing or for a more formal night out with girlfriends and colleagues.   Customer Service Exceptional and consistent  Very attentive waitstaff, not annoying, but just really seek to meet and enhance your dining experience.  Perfect definition of what perfect customer service   Food Excellent Tried the fish and steak as mains, soup and some other foods as appetizers.  Everything was well made  I read that the food can get too salty, I haven't had that experience here yet. I normally don't add much salt to my cooking so my palate would be sensitive to salt overload  Atmosphere Very clean, sophisticated, neat, and cozy Perfect for dates, family get togethers, casual get togethers, any get together really.   It's hard to find a restaurant that excels on all frontiers: this restaurant is truly a gem in the city. Excellence in customer service, food, and atmosphere, seriously, what more can you ask for?   P.S. the location is fantastic as well, so many post dinner options to check out in that area.   Fantastic, fantastic, keep this restaurant bookmarked."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Option was terrible and uninspired. Service was not great. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Some people never cease to complain about the poor service in Toronto restaurants. All I have to say to them is,  go to Sidecar.   The three of us we arrived at Sidecar at the appointed time on a Saturday night, and - horror of horrors - our table wasn't ready. The weather had turned bad and several tables had moved inside from the patio. Never mind. Maître d' Casey got us stools to sit on while we waited, and sent out three glasses of cava. He checked on us frequently and gave us updates. It took about 15 minutes to be seated, upon which the kitchen sent shrimp tempura on the house. This place takes care of its customers and takes responsibility when things go wrong.   The meal: delicious, creamy Sidecar salad; handkerchief pasta with oxtail and sour cream (my favourite dish at Sidecar for a long time now - all three of us had to have it); an Australian shiraz that was, not surprisingly, a bit too heavy on the fruit. Chocolate peanut butter crème brûlée - Reece's à la français.  Service was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, personal - just as we have come to expect after many meals at Sidecar.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My date and I checked out Sidecar last night for a night out in Little Italy.  I was craving some serious carbs to prep for my upcoming half marathon this weekend.  I made reservations through the web for 9pm.  We arrived a wee bit early for our reservations and the server said that our table would be ready shortly.  We were directed to hang out at the bar for a bit and to take a look at their menu.  Drinks  Sidecar - did you know that the restaurant is actually named after a cocktail, so this was a must try drink.  It was good but strong, something with the cognac in it.  Cave Springs Reising (sp?) - My date wanted a light yet sweet white wine and the bartender recommended this wine.  It was lovely.  I think I might actually search it out at the LCBO.  Food  Fresh Oysters - we got some oysters to start and they were delish!  So smooth and flavourful.  A great appetizer to begin the meal  Wild Shrimp Risotto - quite yummy, great creamy texture, descent size shrimp portions  Sockeye Salmon - crispy skin, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Only downside was the greens in the plate were not cut to an edible size to eat.  Service  Wonderful and attentive.  Bread was brought out promptly - which was tasty and fresh.  Our water was refilled a few times which was unexpected.  Atmosphere  Romantic, dimly lit and cozy.  I would recommend Side Car for a date night out or just even dinner in the little Italy area!"}
{"text":"Poor service, terrible food, overpriced. Why bother?"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times over the years, and have always had a great experience. Just in the last month I have been here 3 times! Their patio is so beautiful, and my favorites are the tuna salad and mushroom risotto. It's honestly the best in the city. Thank you for always giving amazing service and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Mostly average. Food was OK. And service was slooooow. We did the tasting menu which was just average. But the service was the deal breaker for us - everything was long and drawn out - rom the time it took to get drinks to the time for each of us in our group to get the bill. And we were the only table in the place except for maybe 3 or 4 on the patio. It didn't make any sense why it was so slow. We all agreed this could have been smoothed over with a bottle of wine or two for the table, but there was no acknowledgement of the speed of service. I don't think any of the 11 of us that were there will be back."}
{"text":"Came in for Winterlicious, I had heard good things.  Calamari was good. Striploin was under cooked and much of it un-chewable. Some of the worst I've had, really. Creme dessert was just okay.  Service was...meh. Didn't feel like the waitress cared. She and others did refill our waters without the need to ask, which was appreciated. Overall though it was one of those rare times when I didn't feel the 15% tip was deserved.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"The place was packed when I went.  Got there, they took our coats.  The service was excellent. Quick water refills, asked us before removing cocktail glasses, told us what things were when putting them on the table.   They were quick to bring us some bread to snack on - with garlic butter on the side. The bread and the butter were very good. Had to stop myself from filling up on that!  Tomato soup was DELICIOUS. Served with a couple croutons & some fresh grated parmesan cheese in the middle. A simple but nice touch. Looked great, tasted even better.  I had the chicken w/ garlic mashed potatoes. Delicious. The only comment I'd have is I could have used more of the amazing sauce.   Also had a bite of my friends steak, it was SO GOOD. Same with the risotto.   Creme burlee for desert was delicious.    Saw the bartender making some pretty interesting looking drinks. They squeeze my oj by hand right before serving. SO GOOD.  Anyway, this place is great and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today the hubby and I visited Sidecar for the first time. We had a special event to celebrate and thought we'd take advantage of the prix fixe menu.  I had the romaine salad, steak and frites, and flourless chocolate cake. My hubby had the tomato soup, shrimp pasta, and flourless chocolate cake.  I won't be able to comment on my hubby's food as I didn't quiz him too heavily on the food. The only things I know for certain are he loved the dessert and the latte.  Good: 1. friendly staff 2. the fresh bread was amazing. crisp and crackly without being tough. just perfect. 3. the frites were wonderful. I asked them to go easy on the salt as I had read other reviews that mentioned the saltiness. I'm glad I did. The lack of salt really let the true potato flavor through, something that is hard to come by in french fries. 4. the cake was great. I prefer a slightly more cakelike flourless chocolate cake, but this was a good example of a more fudge like version. My husband had a huge chocolate buzz afterward. 5. the iced tea is quite good. they brew their own rooibos tea and add flavoring and lemon. a nice change from the traditional canadian iced tea. 6. the bartender makes an *amazing* latte. Such a great head of foam and the rest of the drink was so smooth and tasty. yummy. 7. the prix fixe is an amazing deal. Our bill, before tip, was $71. Which is amazing for a nice dinner in this town.  Average/could be better: 1. the romaine salad: I would have liked the lettuce a bit colder to give it more crunch. Also, the pancetta could have been cut into smaller pieces. It was tough, not gross tough but smoked meat tough, and smaller pieces would have been easier to chew. However, the overall salad was tasty. 2. the steak was good, although a bit chewier in some areas. Considering the price, it's to be expected. I just figured I'd mention it. 3. There was coarse salt sprinkled on my steak. I'm a very low salt eater, so the extra salt made the steak a bit saltier than I would have liked. However, I'm more sensitive than many people. 4. the smoked mustard mayo: didn't get a big taste of smoked mustard. It was creamy and pleasant, but I honestly couldn't taste much beyond 'mayo'.  Overall, we plan on going back as the meal was very tasty and a good deal."}
{"text":"It is a rare thing for me to come up to College but slowly i am beginning to enjoy what it has to offer more and more.  I should just cut and paste what Kris wrote as it was his review that pointed me towards here, knowing I can trust his judgement on all things food and drink.  Me and my +1 went for the Grand Prix menu. Possibly the first time ever i chose salad over soup. The mains I went for the grilled salmon, for which i was asked how i want it. Confused a bit since I have never been asked that for salmon. Went with Medium, should have gone for more well done. It was nice but just felt raw in places but that would be my dislike of raw fish kicking in more than anything else.  With the food I had the old fashioned but I think due the drinking I had done earlier I was not able to fully appreciate it.  The service was great and the staff really friendly.   I found the tables too close together. I kept getting looks from the couple next to me. The probably didn't get my jokes but their loss."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying sidecar as my husband has been wanting to go since February. Finally I got around to make reservations and off we went. I called ahead because I was running 15 mins late and the man on the phone said it was no problem.  When we got there, they seated us inside. I heard they have a great patio and because it was such a beautiful day outside, I asked if we can get a seat outside. But they were fully booked. Which is fine but the waitress that seated us made a comment about priority to people with a reservation but I did, so that turned me off cause she has an attitude. Lucky she wasn't our waitress for the night cause the other girl was really nice. We inquired with the floor manager about the seat outside and he said the same but I guess he saw how disappointed I looked that he offered us champagne. The staff overall was friendly except for the one girl.  The decorations was also really nice. I liked t exposed brick. The ambiance is warm and would be great for a date night.  We ordered the crab cake. They were large but the inside was too wet. It was served with a basic aioli sauce. It tasted good just needed to cook a little longer. I got the scallops for my main that came with a parsnip mash. There was a creamy drizzle on the scallops and it was delicious. The meal was light and perfect for what I wanted. Also, the waitress recommended the dish. Dave got the crusted lamb. His own was also very good. It was more on the rare side when he ordered it medium rare but he didn't mind and it still tasted good.  The food overall was good. Nothing really wowed me but I wouldn't hesitate to come back either.  Next time I'll be sure to request a patio seat when I make my reservations."}
{"text":"As you begin to read this review know that with each passing sentence I write I'm unsure as to whether or not this place deserves a FOUR or FIVE star. Perhaps as I recount my evening in the paragraphs that follow I will recall an X-factor I'm forgetting that will push them over the edge to the land of the coveted 5th star.   I found Sidecar using Yelp (obviously) when searching for spots around the city with great cocktails. A recent trip to San Francisco has elevated my liquor palate and I now simply refuse to casually drink bar rail and mix. The Toronto cocktail standards (Spirit House, Weslodge and Barchef) popped up, but I wanted to avoid the Entertainment district and find somewhere special and unique for my evening. Upon reading the reviews on Sidecar I knew there had to be something to this place as multiple reviews made mention of their Old Fashioned, Negroni, Manhattan and other cocktail standards.   Step two in my evening plans were to do a little menu research and verification. I searched online and found that their menu had great appetizer options and main courses all reasonably priced. Finally sold that this would be a winner, I used the OpenTable option on the Yelp app and made a reso (so easy). To my surprise a 6:30pm time slot was open which was perfect!  Fast forward to Saturday evening my dining companion and I arrived on time and if by some sort of magic were able to grab street parking exactly across the street from Sidecar - what luck! Entering, I was immediately impressed with the intimate setting that Sidecar provided. Dim lighting, semi private seating and an expert decor had my DC and I debating whether or not this spot had been featured on Restaurant Makeover (it wasn't) but still resembled the expertise and savvy that the RM design team brings to the table.   Staff were excellent from the moment we entered, offering to take our coats and even running to fetch my coat later that evening when I realized I needed to top up my parking (and they found it quick and without error). More about the staff later.  We decided on drinks to begin, and I had been obsessing about their spin on my fave Madmen cocktail - The Old Fashioned, since reading about it online earlier that day. Done with Orange oils this was an excellent small adjustment that made the drink smooth and easy to drink cutting down on some of the Bourbon burn that comes with some OF's. Special note: Kudos to Sidecar for using the correct ice for the beverage; single large cube which kept the drink cool without watering down the flavour.   Following two (or three) OF's we decided to order up some shareable appetizers and were immediately sold on the Bufula Mozzarella ($12) - Done with Vine tomatoes, basil and pesto (huge delicious rustic cuts of Mozzarella and Tomatoes) and a half dozen lemon point Oysters. The Oysters (@ $3 each MP) were meaty, fresh and very nice with just lemon.   With our appetites now well piqued, we moved on to ordering mains. My DC selected the Papardelle ($18) - Made with Braised short ribs, aged cheddar, king oyster mushrooms, San Marzano tomato sauce, and Spanish onion. I got a chance to try it and the Papardelle was fresh and perfectly cooked to al dente, while the short rib and aged cheddar were welcome additions to a favourite pasta dish. For my own main I ordered the Crab Risotto ($18) which was made with Atlantic snow crab, bacon, pickled jalapenos, and mascarpone cheese. Much like the Papardelle the Risotto was perfectly cooked and the mix of crab, bacon and jalapenos brought together a different flavour experience with each bite. One moment I was able to pick up the crab and the next the chunks of bacon, all the while absolutely loving the creaminess and spice of the dish!  Food and drink aside a couple items worth mentioning were our server and the bread. Our server was EXCELLENT, topping up our water glasses without us even noticing, ever present but not in our face about ordering. There wasn't one moment where I felt rushed, yet he was attentive enough to always be within earshot when we needed something.   Lastly, the bread (which was also replenished without so much of a peep) was excellent. Two types (one was french bread in taste and the other a wheat bread with rye undertones) were served with a generous cup of butter - excellent throughout the early portion of our evening when drinks were the focus.   All in all an Excellent experience, and there was not one thing I could think of that would put me off Sidecar and because of that I've moved them from a 4 to 5 star. I would highly recommend this place for drinks, appetizers, dinner, dates, or meetings of friends. This modern Canadian/Italian bar and Grill receives top marks in my book - I'll be back!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I always feel a little skeptical of myself when I rate a place 5 stars. What can I say though, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Sidecar. Both the food and service were on point.  My friend treated me to dinner there for my birthday. We couldn't pass up the great deal for the prix fixe; we got the French onion soup (daily soup) and Sidecar salad for appetizers, Steak Frites and Salmon for main, and Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. Some reviews claim the steak frites to be good but I thought it was a little lacklustre in how the steak was handled. What stood out to me was the salmon. It was perfectly cooked--not too dry, still tender with flavour--and dressed with a delicious creamy sauce.   Service was fantastic as well! The waiter was attentive, friendly, and made sure we were kept warm by offering us blankets as we were seated in the back patio (this was back in fall).  I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week with a bunch of friends and I have mixed feelings about it. My appetizer (beet salad) was awful, inedible. My entree was great (gnocchi) and well served. Desert was ok.  I also had a mojito and it tasted good but it just had too much ice on it. After a couple of minutes it was totally watered down. I'm not sure I'll go back, though since it was not cheap..."}
{"text":"I'm not really into celebrating Valentine's day BUT I was extremely happy when my boyfriend and best friends planned a little double date here for this little holiday of love.   Right when I walked my eyes automatically focused on all of the gorgeous maps they have up. Love the decor here. And that exposed brick wall? Yep, Can this be my house?  For Valentine's Day they had a  3 course $40 Prix Fixe Menu That we all opted out of because it honestly wasn't that great of a deal. We ended up getting just as much food and wine for the same price off the regular menu. My boyfriend and I ended up getting the steak frites because we have heard so many great thins about it. It was really good but It looked a lot different than other photos i've seen from there. Should have taken a photo oops!  Other than the steak we got the Salmon tartare and the Lobster Bisque. In my eyes the Tartare was the true star of this meal. It was really spicy and served with tortilla chips. I would go back just for that honestly.   The staff was very attentive and I have to give them props for keeping their sanity because I could never wait tables on Valentines day.   Over all it was a great meal and we had a great time :)"}
{"text":"Group of six of us went to Sidecar before a show. Everything was perfect. Some of us had the Winterlicious menu, others off the regular menu. The service was great. Friendly and knowledgeable in the foods and the wines that they had in the restaurant. Attentive and caring. The food was good to over the top. Well presented and well prepared. I will make an effort to return here, which is the biggest complement of all considering that 8 out of 10 establishments on College Street are eateries."}
{"text":"A solid place in the heart of Little Italy. A recent Friday dinner included violet-marinated olives, delicious fresh bread and butter, and an assortment of mains including a beautifully-cooked steak (along with the requisite frites!) and pan-roasted chicken served with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Flavors were solid and the meal rather tasty, although I thought the flavors of the food did not quite hold up to the promise of the decor (perfectly lovely) and the well-thought out wine list (neither long nor short, but comprehensive). Service was impeccable--my wine glass was never empty--and that is apparently a lot to say about restaurants in this town. Dessert sounded good, but our party was, alas, too sated to be tempted.  All in all, a very good spot, but one that could benefit from some added zing. But then, a typical French bistro meal is quite lovely, too; it's just that it seems dressed up a tad beyond that, but delivers just exactly that. And there's probably nothing truly wrong with that in the end, either."}
{"text":"This was a really enjoyable meal in a nice space. We were seated upstairs in the \"Temperance Society\" bar, but had full access to the Sidecar menu as well. The service was friendly and informative. Many inventive cocktails appeared on the drinks list... I was very impressed by the refreshing and spicy Mezcal Muddle that I ordered, though at $12 for just the drink it was a little on the expensive side.  The menu is fairly small, though well-priced given its quality. Quite a few of the mains are available as Prix Fixe selections, which really makes for a tasty bargain ($25 for salad/daily soup, main and dessert) if you come by on the right days.  I had the steak frites, which came cooked right to order at medium rare. The steak was juicy and flavourful, served with crispy herbed frites that weren't greasy (but maybe a little over-salted.) I didn't hear any complaints from my companions about the salmon, mushroom risotto or veal ravioli.   For dessert we tried the flourless chocolate cake, which came in a small but very rich serving and was almost fudge-like in its texture and concentration of potent chocolate flavour. Even the coffee was tasty and freshly brewed in an individual French press.  I'd certainly come back and eat here again. The atmosphere and look of the place is nice too, whether in the more modern downstairs or vintage speakeasy-inspired digs upstairs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday evening and opted for the prix fixe menu. We thoroughly enjoyed every single bite from start to finish. The soup was creamy and rich, and filling in and of its own right. The salmon as a main was perfectly done: flaky, buttery and melted in my mouth with the perfect amount of crust on top, and the pumpkin pie for dessert was decadent and a great finish to an amazing meal. It's an affordable sit-down restaurant, with a great menu - classic options and innovative flavours. Service was amazing. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. The atmosphere and decor was nice. I liked that the din of conversation set the prevailing mood over anything else. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived, there was a kind gentleman who took us upstairs. Things seem great as we were seated until I noticed the service was not up to par. The restaurant was a lot louder than I thought but that's because there was a group of 6-7 people near us talking pretty loud but they left shortly after we sat down which was a relief.  Service:- Me and the girlfriend were looking at the menus and was waiting to be served/greeted by the waitress but she never came over. She simply went on to refill other tables and wouldn't even look the other way to see my hand raised up for a good 2-3 minutes and ran off somewhere for at least 10-15 minutes . Once she was walking by my direction I actually stood up and raised my hand just so I can grab her attention. FINALLY... We took our orders but by that time we weren't impress.  Food: AMAZING. Went right for the $25 prix fix. Best steak and fries I ever had. Tiramisu did it for me. It wasn't the soft kind it was slightly thick in texture which made it so perfect.   When the lady came to refill our drinks I told her to thank the chef for cooking such an amazing steak. She didn't respond with a very friendly vibe. Just said, \"oh great\"    Overall:  Service  1/5      Food   5/5     Ambience    4/5     Noise level: 4/5 (quite noisy)  I'm usually a generous tipper but because of this lady I had to drop it significantly. The only reason why I even bothered tipping was because she refilled my water a few times. Swiss Chalet's service was 10 times better than this."}
{"text":"Very cute small restaurant with an amazing weekday $25 prix fixe menu - and the food was good! I'll be back for sure - thanks!"}
{"text":"I went to Sidecar with two of my friends on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly quite filling and not too bad at all. The ambiance was fancy, the server was friendly (and super pretty!) and the food was FRESH and DELICIOUS. (I was actually surprised at how fancy the restaurant was. Based on the pictures and reviews on Yelp, I would not have imagined).   We got some free bread, which is never a bad thing.   For drinks, I got the Sparkling Lemonade ($3) and it was just what I needed to balance out the meal. I was about to order the prix fixe ($25), but they ran out of the salmon so I just ordered the seafood linguine ($21) and HOLY CRAP, it was really fresh! The scallop just melted in your mouth and the shrimps were amazing. I love anything with white wine sauce and there was definitely the taste of white wine in the dish. The portions were bigger than I thought they'd be so that was a great surprise. I was really full at the end of dinner and I really couldn't believe I only spent $21 for it. The only thing I noticed about my dish was that it was quite salty and it had A LOT of onions in it. I tried my friend's Soup of the Day ($8) which mushroom puree soup. This was a bit overseasoned as well.   BEWARE - THEY CHARGE YOU FOR WATER? Qwater? When I looked at the bill, I realized that they charged each of us a dollar for the water. I went to the washroom at the beginning of the service and when I came back, the water came so I honestly had no idea we did not get tap water. Next time, you should ask for tap water. But in general, Sidecar was a really fancy place and the quality of the food was top notch. I would definitely suggest taking your significant other here on a date because I know I will.   TLDR; Fancy smancy place with lots of delicious and fresh food. The price is really good for what you get, but I think getting the prix fixe would be the most worth it. ALSO ASK FOR TAP WATER. Worth coming back."}
{"text":"I really liked it here. The atmosphere is really intimate and romantic! I came w an old friend and we had a great time. The food was honestly fab! Server was on point the entire night and not to mention very generous w the wine pours. My risotto w mushrooms had great flavour and was scrumptious! They also have a great selection of digestives for post dinner. The amaretto w orange was lovely. My rose at dinner was fresh and lover pair w my main dish."}
{"text":"Out for an early dinner on College Street, my companion suggested somewhere that yelpers had given a firm thumbs down, so I was relieved to have yelp help toward Sidecar. They graciously invited us in without a reservation and without feeling the need to start a stopwatch on our visit. I've no doubt that they had plenty of reservations for the evening, but the man at the door has perfected the art of communicating that politely.  The oysters were surprisingly drab ($3 each) and I say surprisingly because everything else was so very good. Starting from my cocktail through to my steak & frites and fresh berries for dessert, every bit of it was wonderful.  Worth mentioning the backyard patio. It is wood panelled with canopies covering one side and fabric draping the other. This is good covering from the sun but less successful in the rain. On our evening, this meant the patio was less crowded and a little shuffling of chairs kept us mostly dry. Service was skilled and courteous.  Definitely a recommend from me."}
{"text":"Walking along College in the rain, and not a cool place to go (that could seat us, unlike Bar isobel). Just wanted to grab drinks not dinner  Sidecar sat right away, the bar stools are quite comfortable. Service wasn't so attentive, bartender was super non existent despite being less than a foot away from us. However -- the drinks were great. They brought us free bread and hummus, and even replenished it when we were done!  I'd definitely go back for another girls' night."}
{"text":"Price Fixe menu at Sidecar is bang for your buck. For $25 you can have a salad, entree and dessert which is a deal and a half for their food which is excellent. If you ever want to know what a perfectly cooked piece of fish or steak tastes like go here. I also suggest making reservations.  My only real complaint was the fact that I was seated near the window on a -20c day and spent the whole meal in my coat as I was uncomfortably cold even with a heater beside me... the heater was no match for the ice sheet forming on the inside of the window.  Flourless chocolate cake is to die for. Well done Sidecar. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Last night I had dinner at Sidecar with two of my best girlfriends. The company (as always) was great and so was the dining experience.  My friends had the Winterlicious special and I was quite surprised at the generous portions of all three courses. I had the foie gras to start. It was succulent, as it should have been, but the portion was very small (I've been spoiled by the likes of Au Pied de Cochon). The Tuna that I had for my main was staggeringly good and wonderfully plated. Given just a quick sear on all sides, the fish was like a jeweled ruby inside and tucked under the fabulous plating of the fish were tender fingerlings and vegetables. So often, tuna can be mediocre. That was not the case here.  My friends seemed to enjoy the halibut and the steak that they ordered as well as their desserts.  I opted for a cheese plate that appeared on a large board featuring some manchego, grey owl and pecorino as well as some crunchy walnuts, dried cranberries and quince paste.  The service was wonderful and we didn't feel rushed even when the place began to fill up. Our server was efficient and friendly without interrupting our girl chatter.  I would recommend Sidecar for an intimate romantic dinner or a special night out. I also hear that the patio is really nice in the summer. I'll have to check it out."}
{"text":"A fair attempt for a place that includes gratuity into its prices. I'd veer towards 3.5/5.  It's a nice little restaurant with a back patio. The service was friendly, albeit slow. We had a larger group and while other staff stepped in to help, it was a bit frustrating.  We split the tempura shrimp, which was clearly very fresh with a nice, light batter. I had a delicious mushroom risotto (priced @ $24) while my partner had the steak frites. Both individuals at the table who ordered this dish complimented how tasty the steak was. I tried the accompanying fries and they were crispy and nice.  I received a creme brulee for dessert ($12); it was well done and creamy.  They charge you $1/a person for Q Water, which is filtered four times. You can also get a sparkling version of this.  There was a glitch regarding the reservation however the manager on duty was quick to solve it, so that was a good attempt."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing down Sidecar for awhile and it was definitely worth the wait! I was starving after an hour swim and weights so I was craving Italian. I happened to take the streetcar down and enjoyed the live patio scene around me. I love Little Italy and I always find a way to come down here once a week. When I approached Sidecar I was sad that there was no patio upfront but the menu still happened to convince me to dine here. As I walked in I was early by 15 minutes before they opened but they were so kind enough to seat me for some drinks. The greeter happened to seat me in the back and to my surprise there was a beautiful patio area. I started off with the rosé Pinot Grigio while I searched through the menu. I was given complimentary soft bread and devoured that in seconds. Then I grabbed their Sidecar cocktail.. Man is it strong, not really my thing but I managed to finish it. For appetizers I ordered the Beef Carpaccio and the Mussels, and it was awesomely delicious. My main, I got the Ravioli and the Atlantic Salmon, it was fresh, light and filling. For dessert I grabbed another cocktail called the Dark & Stormy and it was one of the best drinks I have ever had. The ambience, the waitresses and the cocktails were beautiful. I would love to come back here for apps and drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy, cocktails not as good as I expected. Service was horrendous. Half an hour to be seated with reservations at 8pm in Saturday. Then it took another hour for our table of 6 to place a food order. Waiter barely acknowledged us, took over half an hour to take a drink order and didn't acknowledge when we paid our bill. Didn't even bother to get our coats. Won't be back even though the food was good.   When we planned the timeline for the evening we didn't expect for it to take an hour and a half to be seated and place a food order, and an additional 45 min to receive our food. One member of our party had to have a few bites of her risotto and run, the rest of us missed our friend's concert that was down the street. Not cool."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Went for a Bachelorette a couple weeks ago.  ATMOSPHERE- Beautiful & Classy SERVICE- Excellent FOOD- Deelish- perfect, BEST CESAER SALAD EVER!!!  Chicken was nice and juicy!  Wasn't a fan of the cheese cake so much tho. Def want to go back again soon :D"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance. The couple next to us was leaving and they said it was dead empty when they got there, we were seated at the only available table by 7:30pm.  They have a fixed price menu with two vegetarian options which I loved. For $1 per patron you get filtered flat or mineral water, which for me is nice as I always end up paying too much for san pel.  The Sidecar Salad was amazing, my favourite part of the meal hands down as it was so surprisingly good! The Mushroom Bucatini was delishious, very rich and pleantuful I took some home. I found the Chocolate Terrine too rich, but I'm not I prefer vanilla and my date demolished his lol. The Raspberry Coulis and Fresh Whipped Cream though I almost licked off the plate lol. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I think that if Toronto's Sidecar and DC's Cedar had a love child, it might just be the kind of place that I'd need a 12 step program to quit.  Where Sidecar's cocktails rival those of Cedar's, their sit-down dinner dominates, while Cedar's inexpensive and delicious bar bites please the palate (and the tummy!).  In a city dominated by vodka and bottle service, Sidecar offers a true cocktail experience with the ingredients and the mixologists to craft them together in a way that demands respect, admiration, and no small amount of awe.  Pair that up with a generous three course $25 prix fixed menu, each dish being a veritable meal in itself, and you're looking at a mighty fine (and dangerously boozy) perfect dinner out on the town.  That's not even touching upon how polite and professional all of the staff here are.  Or the fact that I had to pack up half my entree and all of my dessert.  So much food I could only eat one and a half courses out of three!  My favorite part of the evening might have actually been sitting at the bar and shooting the shit (read: hearing all about the phenomenal mixology bars around NYC that I haven't had a chance to try yet) with Scott, the bartender on duty this evening.  Apparently he'd just gotten back from a huge cocktail tour of New York, and educated me a bit on some joints I hadn't been to yet.  Now I'm even more excited to go scope them out!  This is truly a local gem that's worth the visit.  Honestly, just go."}
{"text":"Having gone to Carpano recently, I knew I had to check out Sidecar, but i DIDN'T know they had a Prix Fixe $25 from Sunday-Wednesday. Now that's a steal.   For a Tuesday night, it was packed. Every single table. We were able to get a late reservation at 9 pm and we were seated immediately. The host was incredibly nice and so was our waiter. I wasn't expecting the decor to be so nice (is that rude to say?) but the backsplash on the bar was so nice! Loved the stone detailing.   From the prix fixe, I got the sidecar salad which was great and for my main I got the roasted chicken. I WOULD have gone for the steak frites, but I resisted. The chicken was great, very crispy skin. The dessert for the night was a sticky toffee pudding and I found that to be too dry even with the sauce on top.   This place is also known for its cocktails so i tried the \"El Bueno\" which was indeed very bueno and my bf had the BADASS Mojito...with a name like that, I was hoping it'd be badass having bacardi 151 rum, but apparently it wasn't that strong....the \"painless brazilian\" cocktail though was amazing from the few sips I had.   Would come back for the prix fixe."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary but a good standard restaurant.  Started with a carrot and parsnip soup.  This was actually great and a big portion! Then for my main I had a pasta with mushrooms, double smoked bacon, a bit of arugula on the top and cream sauce. The pasta was super fresh (I assume it was made in house) but lacked a bit of flavour and could have been a bit saucier.  The bacon was dried out and hard - not a fan of this.    Then dessert was a chocolate terrine.  A big portion, not overly sweet like you would expect, but also not dark enough (and I am not a dark chocolate fan normally!).  I am in no hurry to come back, but I wouldn't mind if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place!!! The service is impeccable; every server I've had has been kind, genuine and impeccable!! We had Evan as out waiter on the first night and he was excellent! In fact, one of our party left a piece of artwork by our table and he came running out to meet us at he streetcar stop with it!! The next time we went I complimented the host on how much I loved the place and my partner and I were  generously and unexpectedly given cocktails to start off our dining experience. We were seated at the bar which was a pleasant experience as well- not only was the bar tender a great conversationally- he whipped up some MEAN cocktails; he was a true artist! Best cocktails and good I've had on college street! Both the duck confit gnocchi and steak and frite are divine!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a group.  Had the arugula salad and steak frites...both were excellent.  Staff was most pleasant and helpful.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a new place to try out for our 1st year wedding anniversary and stumbled onto the reviews for Sidecar. We were intrigued, went ahead and made reservations directly through Yelp and Open Table. That was pretty easy, even on my iPhone which was great.   It wasn't hard to find, street parking was easy to find as well. Our coats were taken for us which was wonderful and we were given two tables to choose from. Hoping for some romantical privacy, we choose the table right by the window. Only issue I had with that was the rest of restaurant was dimly lit and had little tabletop tealight candles but the lighting over our table was too bright and took away from the ambiance.   We were given our bread and butter, which was DELISH and asked for seconds. We did order from the prix fixe menu and both got the steak frites. We are SOOO adventurous. No regrets and all we kept saying was \"Mmm..\" The steak nice and tender, the fries were crunchy and delish. Our desert was really great too, a touch too sweet for my liking but I've never had much of a sweet tooth anyways.   I wanted to get a drink and asked for suggestions from our very nice waitress and ended up with the Badass Mojito from her suggestions. Could be that I rarely drink but I found mine to be very strong and lit up like a christmas tree due to my silly Asian genes that turn me red from any amount of alcohol. Despite being a little embarrassed about that, it was a wonderful treat to go out and enjoy ourselves.   Only complaint I have was that it started to get pretty noisy in the restaurant, of course I know that such a thing is out of the restaurant's control. I just had the impression that it was a quiet and intimate restaurant.   We would def go back again!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for just over a year and I've always wanted to try out this restaurant and I'm so glad I finally did!  The menu isn't super extensive but everything on it was making my mouth water with the culinary possibilities.  It was so hard to pick when everything looked so awesome...so I went with my time honoured tradition of a split-second decision when the waiter showed up to take orders.  I ended up going with the Sidecar Salad to start (an awesome tomato, cucumber, lettuce and feta concoction with a creamy oregano dressing) and then the Mushroom Risotto for my main (truffle oil=awesome).  Both were fantastic...I especially enjoyed the salad - a great and refreshing summer choice.  Drink-wise, most people at my table got a cocktail to start (I went with just a beer) and raved about their Cosmos, Mojitos and Ginger Lemonades...so Sidecar seems to know their way around alcoholic beverages but I can't actually vouch for that.  Though I can vouch for my friends...and their judgment is generally sound (except for that one time which I can't legally get into ;))  The only downside to the evening - and the thing that kept me from giving them the full 5-star treatment - was the service.  We made reservations for our dinner a couple of days before and the person taking the reservation was super snippy about fitting us in and told us they could give us a table at 7 pm but we'd have to vacate by 8:30.  Keep in mind, they don't have \"sittings\" per se, so I didn't really get that but whatever...way to bring customer service to a whole new level.  So not surprisingly the waiter was pretty much rushing us the whole time...so as good as the food was, it was hard to really enjoy it when we had someone breathing down our necks the whole meal.  Not cool.  My advice to Sidecar - if you can't fit people in and give them a nice meal without reminding everyone of the Rushing of the Bulls, just say you're full up...no one's lives will end and everyone will be happier in the long run.  That said...I'd most likely go back to sample some of the other awesome dinner items but on a less busy night...so I can actually take the time to enjoy the food and the company.  An FYI to all - they have a Prix Fixe dinner menu from Sunday to Wednesday...I think I'll have to check that out too!"}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious and had a great time. This is one of my favourite restaurants, so maybe I'm biased.  I ordered the calamari, steak, and chocolate torte. The calamari and torte were both quite good, but the steak was really, really [bloody] good. I would strongly recommend getting the steak. And of course, the bread and dip were good too. The drinks were fantastic as always. Be sure to order something different/interesting. Their bartenders are truly talented and can whip up something according to your preferences (i.e. something with egg yolk, something with gin)."}
{"text":"$27 prix fix menu  I was drawn here by the high ratings and the $27 prix fix menu. Also, the OpenTable points are always a nice bonus :)  My BFF wanted to try something new, so I did some research on Yelp and was convinced! We came on a Sunday on the long weekend. I called to make sure that they were still offering the prix fix menu (being a long weekend and all) and they did.  They give you some bread with this hummus-like spread, which was very good. Two types of bread - the crust was hard, but not bad.  We both ordered the soup to start. It was some tomato soup (think marinara sauce) with chunks of seafood in it (I think lobster or shrimp...). A bit spicy but still good.  I had the steak frites. It was quite large - probably more than 8oz like the menu said. It was thick cut and cooked medium rare. I saw past reviews and knew that if I wanted medium rare, I would have to tell them medium. Unfortunately, it was quite tough and chewy. The aioli was good. The fries were quite hard. The picture on their website is not what came on my plate.  My BFF got the salmon. This was very good - deliciously seasoned and cooked well. I would recommend getting this. However, the size of the salmon seemed smaller than what others have gotten here, judging by the pictures on Yelp.  We were given no choice for dessert. It was an upside-down pineapple cake. It took quite awhile to get to the table, but I guess they were baking it? It was plated very nicely with super sweet caramel surrounding the cake. My BFF complained that the pineapple on top was not fresh / fake. I ate his share.  Service was average, I would say. We ended up paying $70 after tax and tip. I guess for a 3-course meal, it's not bad. My BFF said he would go again, and that it would be a good place for a special occasion or a date (lol). Avoid the steak frites!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. And gratuity free. Would highly recommend it. Delicious! Patio was lovely"}
{"text":"Some of my favourite moments in life are when you're immersed in deep meaningful conversation.  Whether its philosophical about the meaning of life, what it means to be a speck in this world or maybe something more trivial like which part of the planet to explore next and why, you get zoned in with your conversational partner and everything around you just darkens and there's only one focus.... Until some well intentioned young seemingly inexperienced waiter interrupts over and over again at the most in opportune times.  As my lovely French companion tells me the about approaching a critical fork in the road in her life path and weighing the pros and cons of staying in Canada or returning to her small town in the south of France seemingly just about to reach the climax to her decision, the pimpled face barely over reaching his puberty server pops over my should with a smile, \"Can I bring you some more water?\".   \"That'd be lovely\" I'd respond.    Seemingly returning back to reality, my friend goes back to realizing such a decision on her future maybe should be delayed and maybe not made over an overly cooked fairly chewy fairly flavourless \"medium-rare\" steak frites.  The reality that was our steak was a bit more than disappointing as our expectations of Sidecar was maybe a tad high.  Accommodating as they were, allowing the both of us to have a half order of salad and half order of fries, which was a genius suggestion to wit has never crossed my mind, there was something unexplainable that was missing.    Like having to get a motor restarted, we move on in our conversation, about life's regrets and the hardships we've encountered along the way, such as the steak we were chewing on much akin to jerky like that of which is our lives, the moment is ruined again when the waiter jumps in asking to take our butter knife away.  Was that really necessary?  Or the times he'd come in to ask to remove the side plates.  Or to take away our wine glasses when it was obviously not empty.  Or to ask how the wine was.  Or to then return to ask yet again if he could take away our wine glass.  Or to take away the bread dish.  Or to fill our water when it was still half full.  Or to ask how the how the steak was.  Or to bring us more bread.  Or to fill our water glass yet again. Or to bring us our dessert menu only to return to what seemed like seconds later to ask what we'd like before we had even opened the menu to look. Or to ask us again how we were.  Or to ask if we were ready.  I appreciate the attention, however we were exhausted in starting and restarting our conversational motors.    We spent more time asking \"Where were we?\"  \"What were you saying again?\"  \"Why the heck is this kid back again?!?!\"  Like a well caring mother, it was extremely difficult in getting angry with our server, as he was only doing his job, and not only that, probably thinking to himself that he was going above the call of duty, to which it was like a warfare to our conversation.  Maybe he really was trying to impress us, but more likely he was there to impress the French girl with some battre le fer pendant qu'il est chaud.  The dessert was not memorable, as several days later now, I struggle to remember what two was even ordered and shared.  At the end of the day, there are no real complaints, and I can understand the legions of fans who love Sidecar, but on this night...  \"Seriously dude.. are you still standing over my shoulder?  No.. I DO NOT need more water!  No you can not take away any more plates. Dude... you're in my house.  No.. you can't go get my pants for me.  Back rub? Ok sure.. just this one time, then you have to go back to Sidecar ok?\""}
{"text":"I pass by this place every day and it was only a matter of time before I gave it a go.  Was really looking forward to it due to the tremendous support they get from yelp.  The beef carpaccio was delicious, except I couldn't really taste it as it was drowning in olive oil.  With a little less oil, and a bit more parm, this would've been fantastic.  The cured atlantic salmon tasted of lemon zest, horse radish but little else. Where'd the salmon flavour go?! The rosti was well made and I enjoyed eating that more than the salmon.  Mushroom risotto was in-fucking-credible! Delicious, buttery smoothness, enough melty-gooey cheese to make your soul melt upon ingestion.  Seriously, I sighed after each bite.  Cauliflower risotto was good as well, but completely overshadowed by its mushroom counterpart.  Lacked innovation or uniqueness to make it memorable.  The 2 pieces of roasted chicken I had were polar opposites. The white meat was incredibly dry, and bland tasting.  The dark meat was fatty, juicy and delicious.  The cripsy skin was great on both, but I really didn't enjoy eating the breast.  If you get the chicken, see if they'll give you 2 pieces of dark meat.. it's a world of difference.  The pan seared sea bass was very standard, tasteless and boring, it made me sadder with each chew until I was frowning.    Service was great and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waiter misheard our order and ended up bringing us the wrong risotto.  No prob, they let us eat that and promptly brought us out another one within minutes.  Prices are pretty reasonable too.  $180'sh for 2 with a bottle of wine.  Not too shabby.  I think I have to give it another try.  Was informed that they have weekend BBQ's in the back patio with a menu that sounds amazing.  For now, 3 stars is all I can give."}
{"text":"Straight to it.    Steak Fritas - moist, succulent, cooked the way I ordered it.  This 8oz Sirloin was everything it was supposed to be.  Chocolate Peanut Butter Creme Brulee - yeah, at first I was thinking \"who the hell would dare to put chocolate and peanut butter in their creme brulee?\"  But after the first bite I understood. The peanut butter taste stood out above the chocolate, and like most things with the word 'creme' the dessert was decadent.    Service:  What an awesome wait-staff.  I was there on a Saturday late night.  My party was assisted by multiple waiters, all whom seemed to go out of their way to do something extra."}
{"text":"I'd heard so many good things about Sidecar over the years but I'd never gotten a chance to check it out till a month ago when their sign of \"Negroni Slushies\" lured us in for an early dinner during the Taste of Little Italy. Overall, while the Negroni Slushies lived up to their name and were strong, the food and overall ambiance left us feeling a little underwhelmed. Perhaps I had built this place up a little too much in my head.   After having quite a long day of eating I wasn't too hungry, so I settled just for their sidecar salad and it ended up being just OK. I must say that for such a nice looking restaurant with a good reputation, their food prices were not too high, I won't mind giving them a second chance in the future when I'm feeling a bit more hungry, but I won't be rushing back to them.   A slight note against them is that they serve some fancy water so there is a $1 charge on that, I guess the water tasted good? But I would have been happy with just some tap water. Leave the fancy water for the people that actually want it."}
{"text":"Upon entering Sidecar my first thought was that its layout resembled a tram car with its oblong layout.  The staff (predominantly male), were dressed in a fashion that resembled the staff aboard the Titanic.  The restaurant was cozy and intimate and I loved the decor.At first I thought Sidecar was referencing a train car of some sort, but through research I discovered that it is actually named after a cocktail, traditionally made with Cognac, orange liqueur (Cointreau, Grand Marnier or another triple sec), and lemon juice. [1]  So how does this all fit in together?  Sidecar is in a joint venture with the Toronto Temperance Society,  a members-only club with a $285 membership fee which promises you access to \"...the finest selection of spirits and alcoholic minglings in Toronto.\" [2] It is located on the upper level of Sidecar.  It should also be noted that Carpano - its sister restaurant is just down the street.  We were promptly seated and brought menus.  The menu is not extensive but we managed to find our heart's desire.  After having had a whole week of lavish dinners, I decided to opt for an appetizer instead as I wasn't that hungry to begin with.  In the end we opted for Poutine and Seared Scallop & Duck Confit.But before we get to all the exciting food, I should give their bread basket an honourable mention.  All their breads are baked daily, in-house.  I was enamoured by their Ciabatta which had a nice crust to it.  They also served up a Chive & Sour Cream Ale Loaf with subtle accents of dill, which I was expecting to be better than the plain-looking Ciabatta but don't let appearances fool you!  The ale loaf was denser, but was not crusty at all.  The spreadable butter and Ciabatta make a calorie-conscious gal like me forget all about it!  The Scallop & Duck Confit was served with pea shoots and semi-dried Ontario peaches.  I have never ate pea shoots in a non-Chinese restaurant before, but this dish was delectable!  It made me rekindle my romance with pea shoots.  I dare say that it was better prepared and tasting than any Chinese restaurant I've dined at.  It was cooked, but still had a fresh crunch to it.  Nicely done Sidecar!  The scallop without a doubt pushed my daily sodium intake over the edge as I got hit with more than just a grain of salt.  However, it was perfectly seared and with the pea shoots, sweet peaches and tender duck confit - was a sublime combination.   French fries + cheese curds + duck gravy?  You had me at poutine!  This dish, again was heavy on the sodium, but what poutine isn't?  It is served with a house made beef pepperoni, and Monforte's cheese curds.  The gold standard for poutine was Au Pied de Cochon's version at Martin Picard's restaurant in Montréal. Now if only we could substitute Sidecar's beef pepperoni with Martin's foie gras; that would be a match made in heaven!  For me, the beef pepperoni didn't add anything to the dish.  In fact, I would've much preferred it with just the Monforte cheese curds and rich duck gravy.  Verdict:  I am so happy that I finally got to experience a meal at Sidecar.  It has definitely made its way into my stomach and Top 5 list of places to eat in Toronto alongside Black Hoof and Woodlot.  Many patrons rave about their Steak Frites.  As we were leaving, we saw 3 of 4 in a family of 4 with steak frites at the table.  If my suspicions are correct the frites would be the same as the ones used to craft their poutine.  If the food I experienced was any indication of the rest of Sidecar's dishes, I will become a VIP diner sometime in the near future.  You can bet your bottom dollar I will be having a cocktail or two when I revisit Sidecar now that I know of its connection with the Toronto Temperance Society.  This is a restaurant that every Torontonian should try!  [1] Wikipedia [2] Toronto Temperance Society"}
{"text":"Sidecar is swoonworthy and a gal's best friend.  Came in a cold winter night when Caplansky's was out of meat again (again!?) and needed some gastronomical pampering after a yucky day. I had passed by many times but unfortunately my smoked meat fix always kicked in. Well this was not the case tonight and although the place looked full I walked in and was greeted right away by the bartender who promied to take good care of me.  Started off with a blueberry gin and tonic which hit the spot and went down smooth. Let me say a thing about the drinks here: the owners are bartenders who have worked in the industry for many years and definitely know how to make a drink; especially one where you can't taste the alcohol. Drinks are inventive here and come with cute names like 'badass mojito'!   I had their $22 prix fixe dinner which runs from Sun-Wed and you get a choice of appy, main and chef's choice of dessert. Pretty fab! The sidecar salad came up first and this was a nice play on a chopped salad with the creamy dressing and chunks of feta-good flavors throughout. My main was the steak frites and it didn't disappoint. The steak was a nice tender cut, grilled to perfection and seasoned well throughout-I was surprised at how well the steak turned out considering it's prix fix! Frites were thin and crispy and came with a nice smoked pepper aioli. OH that reminds me, I forgot to mention the bread-bread is good here in that in comes with a roasted garlic butter, had to refrain from nibbling away at the whole basket!! With my main I had the thai ginger lemonade which was light and refreshing.  The dessert was flourless espresso chocolate cake with whipping cream-not too big and very delectible. Just a small hit of sweetness.  This really made my night. Thanks guys, came in feeling in the dumps this place seemed to revive my spirits with simple well-prepared bistro food and sincere, professional service.  This place would be great for dates, get-togethers with friends and the value is outstanding even if you're not ordering from the prix fix menu. You definitely won't feel like you're getting fleeced here. They do fill up quickly here (I was lucky squeeze in by myself when the place was booked for a party) so I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"It was in a past life,before I started reviewing on Yelp, that I first came to Sidecar, and the other night was my second visit in, I guess at least 3 years.   I chose this place for our large group because of the great prix fixe option ($25 dinner), good food, and classy but not pretentious yet casual but not too casual atmosphere.  It feels cozy, especially since it seemed like we had the entire restaurant. Other patrons were upstairs (I assumed the secret door near the front led to an upstairs dining room), and in their 'secret' patio at the back.   The menu is a mix of Italian and American/Canadian (new, traditional - never really know what it all means). There are some pastas, and lots of great entrees all fresh local and , I think possibly organic. The back of the menu lists their sources and vendors.   AT got the set menu with we upgraded with an appetizer from the regular manu (usually Soup, Caesar Salad and Sidecar Salad). We got the Lamb Shoulder Croquettes with Haloumi. ($14) The Croquettes wasn't anything amazing, but I loved the Haloumi cheese, baked with a gamey taste.  Also feedback from the table indicated that the Sidecar salad was something different and really good.   For mains, most of the table got the Trout. Really good portions, and you'll be full afterwards. I got the Pork Belly Parppadelle. At first bite, I was like, oh no, this is going to be another bland tomato sauce based pasta. Was I mistaken. Topped with some type of salty hard cheese, the flavours seemed to meld together with the pork belly oils and the artichokes in there. Super tasty, I think I ate too much overall.   The prix fixe also comes with a dessert, which you can also upgrade with a fee. Today was a flourless chocolate cake instead of their usual Ricotta Cheesecake. It wasn't just chocolate - it was infused with some orange peel and surrounded by a caramel sea salt sauce and topped with alcohol soaked cherries.  I love the fresh and unique taste on food that isn't boarding on a fad (ahem, Asian fusion) with good prices and portions. Plus, more than just one thing I'd want to try! Great for groups, with parents etc."}
{"text":"What a great little find amongst the 488953257 other restaurants in this area. Walking in around 9pm on a Friday, it was still really full but the host was really pleasant and escorted us to the bar and kept us in the loop the entire time duration until the table was ready (which we didn't even utilize..)  I had the duck confit gnocchi and it was so incredibly delicious. And for a beverage I had the grapefruit gimlet that that I'd definitely go back for again."}
{"text":"Friday night, I went to Sidecar for dinner with two friends. Overall, I was incredibly pleased with our dining experience there. The service itself gives this review fives stars, because if I could, I'd give our waiter a 10/5 alone. He was friendly, knowledgable and super accommodating.   We were probably the worst table ever: My friend had a lot of food change requests, and I actually ordered the wrong thing from the menu without realizing it. Without batting an eyelash, our waiter not only got the kitchen to whip up the dish I MEANT to order, but he quickly replaced the food my friend was served with the right dishes (she has asked for both dressing on the side for the salad, and no butter on the fish due to an allergy). We had both replacements in under 2 minutes. Wow!   The food itself was great, though not out of this world. We were given an 'amuse bouche' of tuna cakes to start - they weren't great. They were actually pretty terrible, but it was free, so I won't focus too much on it.   One of my friends ordered the Sidecar Salad and the Seared Rainbow Trout. I had a taste of both and they were delicious. My other friend ordered the Poutine - again, I had a taste and it was fantastic. I had the Papardelle (the dish I meant to order, oy) and it was so, very good. The hazelnuts were a very interesting choice in the dish, and made it something special. The Pinot Grigio we ordered to go with our food was also delicious.   Near the end of our meal, our waiter approached us and let us know that, if we wanted, there was a table upstairs at the Toronto Temperance Society (a member-only venue; memberships costs approx. $300 a year) that we could have. We immediately said yes, as a couple of us had been there before and really liked the vibe. I had no idea that Sidecar was part of the TTS, to be honest, nor that they could offer us access to this venue. We had several drinks upstairs and it was just a fantastic cap to the night.  Thank you so much, Sidecar, for a great dinner and night!"}
{"text":"Cheap prix fixe, amazing cocktails and the best steak frites in town. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I remember Sidecar as the restaurant that served the best steak dinner I had. I'm not a big steak connoisseur so I haven't  frequented many steak restaurants yet, but I am a big fan of steak sandwiches.  Sidecar had a great ambiance and class. The food prices were fair and the drink list was large but pricey. I had the Negroni with my steak dinner and it was a great natural pairing. On top of the tender and juicy steak, the accompanying fries were fantastic as well. When dipped in the garlic herbed mayo, your mouth experiences magic beyond that of David Blaine's career.  Overall, I felt important at Sidecar. It's a place for the business crowd and popular as an after work hang-out spot. It's relaxing, calm and an intimate restaurant."}
{"text":"Sidecar is a lovely, cozy little place on College St (\"Little Italy\" although we know that's a bit of a misnomer).   The menu, while not extensive is very good value.  They serve up casual bistro fare done very well indeed.   We opted for the prix fixe menu ($24) and found everything to be of fine quality indeed.  Two of us had chicken (rarely ordered by us) and it was quite delish!  The salmon was perfectly tender and done to medium perfection as was the steak frites.  The steak was a tender, delicious and a perfect medium rare.  While not the best frites I've ever had, they were still yummy. The salads were good but nothing to write home about. Minor quibble - the service was adequate at best.    Food - **** Price $$ Ambience **** Service **"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday and missed their set menu but had a great meal anyway. We were two couples and sat in the back of the downstairs section which is very cosy. The service was a very good blend of attentiveness and comfort and the house wine (Portuguese) was very good for the reasonable price.  Both couples started with the mussels which were probably the best I've ever had - a thin coconut and lime sauce which works incredibly well together. That reminds me that the white bread, which I used to eat the sauce with, was also amazing. Not sure what they did to it but it was good!  I had the lamb shank which was very tasty but maybe a tad small for a big guy and the rest of the table had the half chicken and risotto. All said their meals were very good. I got to eat the rest of my wife's risotto which I was only too happy to do.  The two desserts we ordered were shared and were very well presented, even better to taste and were large enough to share.  Overall, a great place to have a very good meal without breaking the bank. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"IF I had anything bad to say about this place, it would have been erased by the efforts to redeem themselves and the proactiveness to correct their errors.  For a Sunday night dinner, this place seems to have their tables filled whenever it became available, good thing my friend made reservations.  As we dug into the bread, the waiter  took our Prix Fixe orders.  Soup of the Day was Mushroom Soup Puree which was HOT in a good way, with great consistency through-out and flavoured to perfection with what I believe to be a drizzle of Truffle Oil and topped with Fresh CRACKED peppers.  The BLACK pepper was so fresh that at first I thought I was biting into Chili Pepper because I couldn't see much in the dim mood-lighting.  The Entree took a little bit longer than the Appetizer but that is because all the plates were served simultaneously as we looked at the Steak Frites, Fettuccini, Atlantic Salmon, Roasted Chicken.    My Fettucini had the nicest PORTION of Black Tiger Shrimp I've ever seen while the non-commercialized pasta itself was al dente and a good pasta selection to absorb the Tarragon Shrimp Broth Sauce.  I really liked the Tarragon flavour in the sauce.  The Chocolate Torte was a RICH Chocolate Ganache with a drizzle of Raspberry Coulis on the side however it is the Whip Cream that mades the better accompaniement.  I had a taste of the Peanut Butter Creme Brulee too but not a big fan of the overwhelming Peanut Butter taste, but that's my personal preference.  The waiter must have topped our WATER 20+ times during our 2 hour stay.  That service in itself is pretty unique to speak of.  As for the Prix Fixe dessert, if you ask NICELY you might get a secondary choice to choose from."}
{"text":"started with their Badass mojito - was pretty good but, holy damn, was stiff...  as for food we ordered from vday prix fixe,  1st course - caviar bite  2nd course - salumi, cheese, white anchovy, pickled eggplant and mushrooms. 3rd course - steak and frites 4th course - chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream 5th course - pettite four  overall.... was good, but not as good as expectation that was built by all the reviews.. i find the steak not so tender, but the fries with the black garlic mayo was to die for..  next time i crave steak, this wouldn't be my first choice.. maybe much further down on my list...but there was no doubt that the cocktails were delicious and the service was great.. Sidecar is one of those place that isn't the first restaurant i will think of when i want to go out for a nice meal, but i wouldn't completely ignore either.. didn't wow me but solid four stars...!"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant with good ambiance and great service. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food but we noted that the cavatelli was very, very salty. Maybe we got a bad batch?"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I had the prix fixe...it was decent, but I'd love to go and order from the regular menu.  +++PROS+++ 1. Simple reservation system through Open Table (online) 2. Good value.  Can't beat a $24 prix fixe (afterall, Asians are cheap, aren't we?). 3. Excellent service, I didn't find them to be too attentive 4. Clean bathrooms, definitely 'deuceable' 5. The sidecar is quite a fantastic drink, even for quasi non-drinkers like me.  I assume their other cocktails are equally as impressive. 6. Good place to bring a date 7. Decent portion sizes.  ---CONS--- 1. Cramped seating 2. Food was only so-so.  I had the steak frites, which was a sirloin.  Even cooked rare, it was pretty chewy.  Well, I guess it was a sirloin afterall.  Fries were nice. 3. Chef's choice of dessert I wasn't feeling too much.  They called it 'cake', but it was more like a couple of uber-rich pieces of fudge. 4. It is busy, even on a Wednesday night at 8pm.  That's all I got.  Would definitely go back.  Brap brap!"}
{"text":"This place is recommended for large groups, but beware!! They could not handle 10 people on a friday night and it was not even busy, there were empty tables all around us. Painfully slow service, the waitress did not offer to bring us new drinks (we were there for 4.5 hours), food was average - nothing special. Never going back."}
{"text":"Great place. The food was tasty and the drinks as well. What stood out most about this \"modern european\" spot was that it actually felt as though you were in a Mediterranean country having dinner: the serves let us sit and enjoy our meal, drinks  and company without coming back every few minutes or create an urgency to rush us out. They were also very helpful and accommodative to my gluten-free and dairy free diet. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Certainly my favourite restaurant in Toronto.  My partner had taken me here for Valentines Day nearly five years ago and ever since then I need to visit every few months - it is certainly a gem in this city with a very unique menu.  I come here for birthdays, other vday dates and just because. I also recommend this restaurant to everyone I meet. :)  They serve a high quality of food that tastes very fresh (bonus: they try to source locally). The chef cooks everything to perfection.  Everything I have tried has been heavenly(mmm my mouth waters thinking about the dishes).  Most recently I tried the Duck confit gnocchi, it was creamy with a generous portion of flavorful and lean duck.  Oh and don't get me started on the bread and butter....so delightful.   The prices are reasonable, actually fairly cheap considering it mirrors a fine dining type of restaurant and the customer service has always been exquisite.  The restaurant has a warm ambiance, it is perfect for dates. While the back patio is also very romantic with pretty lights and trees.   If I could give Sidecar 10/10 stars I would.  Also don't forgot to order their unique and flavorful cocktails."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, a hidden patio in the back that feels like you're out of the city.  I've been here several times and it is my favourite restaurant on the Little Italy College strip.  The food is always good and great service.  We usually go Sun-Wed to take advantage of the prix fixe deal. The servers are very attentive and we've been comped frites and cake (!) when they've overheard comments from our table. My kids usually choose this place to go out for a special birthday dinner. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend with a reservation a month or two ago and we ended up with a small table up by the front window. This would normally seem like a good thing, but the side door that is near it I believe it the one that leads people up to the Temperance Society upstairs, and every time someone went in there a crazy gust of cold air would hit us, which was certainly the low light and biggest inconvenience of our experience.   Aside from that, on to the good... I started with the poutine which was rich and tasty with duck confit and goats milk cheese curds. Then for the main, I went with the Lamb Shank which came on a bed of white beans and rapini. Everything was really good and I'd eat it again without hesitation. The flourless chocolate cake was adequate dessert, although not really memorable.   The $25 mid week prix fixe seems like a better value for this place, but even without it we did leave satisfied with our experience outside of the cold breezy chills frequently encountered as previously mentioned... So I'll just save my next meal for a warmer weather date or at least simply insist to sit further from the front.  ."}
{"text":"Sidecar is my go-to restaurant for a great French meal. Last night was no different. Good food and great staff. Make sure to ask them for advice on ordering.  We had the oysters (terrific), the cassoulet (well-received) and the steak frites (perfect). The server had a great suggestion for the wine."}
{"text":"I had Side Car bookmarked for a long time but wanted a special occasion to visit. I planned my birthday there this year and invited about 13-15 people to come out for dinner and drinks.   My first call, I spoke to the owner and let him know I wanted to make dinner reservations for a Saturday next month. I asked if we could do ala carte menu because there were a few items on their regular menu I'd love a chance for my friends to try. The set menu was very basic and didn't have the more creative items from their menu. I only asked this because on their website it says the set menu is only encouraged for large groups but not mandatory.   He said okay, but only if he can push the reservations from 7pm to 8:30pm. I said it's a little late for dinner but I understand because of the regular menu and even told him don't worry about the food coming out at different times. So the reservation was made and I promised to call back the week of to reconfirm numbers.   I call back 3 days prior to Saturday and spoke with the person who answered the phone, which I thought was the owner in the beginning of the call but he didn't seem sure of having spoken to me before. He started telling me that my guests and me would have to do the set menu after i confirmed 15 would be the number. So I told him no, I spoke with the owner last time and he said we wouldn't have to and that's why our reservations were pushed to 8:30pm instead of 7pm. He then went on to reveal that he was the person I spoke to last time and their policy is the set menu for large groups. (Then why tell me differently the first time and make me push my reservations from 7pm dinner time to 8:30pm???)  Then the cherry on top was when I let him know that 2 of my friends are coming from a chinese banquet dinner before hand but they'll definitely order more than $30 worth of drinks, to which he said no... and I quote \"Miss you have to understand I lose money for every chair in this restaurant, so if your friends come in and doesn't have the set menu that's $100 I lose.\"   At this point i probably should have canceled my reservations, seeing that they lied and pushed my reservation to 8:30, then bullied me into doing the set menu before saying that 2 of my friends couldn't celebrate my birthday with me because they aren't having the set menu they forced us to have. I was busy and didn't want to find a new place and have to msg my friends the change in location and plus a few other bars I wanted to go to was near by. So after he said at least this way the food will all come out together, I confirmed my reservation.  Saturday arrives... reservations were confirmed and we still had to wait 10-15 mins with 15 of us standing in the small front entrance. Food came out irrationally and not together... 2 of my friends had to sit at the bar even though they had chairs available... my best friend managed to talk them into at least letting me have the lamb pasta instead of the steak, chicken or veggie pasta on the set menu given that it was my birthday...EVERYONE HAD TO GET TIRAMISU for dessert. I didn't realize that restaurants were all about $ value per chair and not the amazing food they create... I'd expect it from wait staff at a chain restaurant where they need the turn over tips to top up their salary.  Only redeeming feature was their craft drinks... delicious. Huge let down in service unfortunately."}
{"text":"Of course, this place shine's like my shoes in the cocktail selection, my area of focus being the whisky friends Millionaire (40 creek whisky, grenadine, orange bitters, egg white) and the Kick in the Pants (redbreast irish whisky, johnny walker black, lemon, oregat, plum bitters).  My dinner was the lamb sirloin which was good but the memories were the drinks.  Gotta love nice window people watching in Little Italy and I'm pondering a Temperance Society membership upstairs... wondering what the admission requirements are besides the fee?"}
{"text":"A classic bistro with a simple menu, well executed and with attentive and professional service. The steak frites was popular and deservedly so. The frites were delectable and the steak done simply and served to taste.  My friend had the short rib bucatini which was rich, hearty, and a great comfort food choice.  The highlight, however, was the beef carpaccio appetizer. The beef was perfectly prepared but the magic was complementing it with crispy matchstick fries and aioli mayo. Worth going back just for that dish."}
{"text":"I was vacationing in Toronto with a group of friends, and we chose Sidecar for our fancy vacation celebration dinner.  One of my friends is a finicky eater, so Sidecar was in some ways a compromise choice.  There was stuff on the menu that appealed to everyone.  And for a fancy dinner, Sidecar went the distance for us.  The service was outstanding.  When they were unable to accommodate our request to sit outside in their lovely backyard - even though we had made reservations - they brought us a round of cava to apologize, followed by a salmon tartare on crostini as an amuse bouche.  It was a very kind touch, and it certainly made us feel special.  Likewise, the kitchen staff certainly seems to bring a great deal of care to their work.  The pappardelle I ordered were clearly homemade, and the pasta was beautifully thin and delicate, and perfectly cooked.  The carpaccio I ordered as an appetizer was equally beautiful.  However, for all the care that the kitchen brought to the food, most of us at the table agreed that it fell short of that fifth star, and the reason for that was flavor.  Now, don't get me wrong, we had a very good dinner here.  It's just that for a fancy restaurant with a fancy price tag, the food just didn't wow the way we'd hoped it would.  While the papperdelle were indeed beautiful pasta, the sauce they came with - while rich with the umami flavors of mushroom and short rib - just seemed to be missing some flavor to balance it out and really make the dish sing.  Likewise, the friend who ordered the ravioli thought the filling was rich but again fell just short of fantastic in flavor.  The apple fritters we shared as a dessert were surprisingly heavy.  For me, it was one almost-great dish after another, all night.  The finicky friend, however, thought his steak frites was perfect.  If I lived in Toronto, I'd definitely make a return trip to Sidecar and give them another chance to impress, especially if I'm with a less-adventuresome eater.  Their menu did seem to strike a perfect compromise where another restaurant might have failed at that.  I can easily imagine having gone to a place where I'm bowled over by the food, only to have the evening ruined by watching my friend sigh and make yukface all night.  So for that reason, our trip to Sidecar was a success, and the four stars are well-earned."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a winterlicious dinner 2 weeks ago. The menu is actually similar to the regular $25 prix fixe menu they have. Except that one is only available from Sunday to Wednesday and only has 1 dessert option.   For starter, I ordered the Daily Soup (mushroom at the time) and it was huge in portion, very filling. Most of my other friends ordered the salads but portions seemed kinda small. For main, I had the Atlantic Salmon and that was pretty good. I liked the crispy edges and it was quite soft inside. Yum~ Most of my group ordered this. Only one friend ordered the Steak Frites, which they liked. However, someone I know went here for a dinner a week earlier and said Steak Frites were not very good and not even hot when served. I guess it depends on your luck.   For dessert, I had the Chocolate Ganache and think it would have been nice if they added something to balance the sweetness of it. I got to also sample a Whipped Cream & Raspberry Coulis Lemon Cake and a Vanilla Pannacotta from my friends. The Lemon Cake is very strong in lemon flavour, not overly sweet and more tart. Just right for my friend who ordered it. For the Pannacotta, I personally would pass on it. It didn't have the consistency I would have expected. Thought it would be slightly more gelatinous? Stiffer then what was served at least.   Service was good. Server was nice and paid attention, worrying if I enjoyed my meal since I was the only one still eating. Assured them, I'm just a slow eater. lol. There was also a last minute addition to our group and the restaurant was pretty nice about accommodating us on that too.   Overall, the restaurant and service is nice but except for the Atlantic Salmon...nothing really wowed me. Just if you are only in the area, I would check it out. The prix fixe menu is a decent deal...portions are good for the price.   FYI: If you have mobility issues, think twice about going to the washroom here. It's down a narrow flight of stairs (they do have a railing) and the ceiling is very low. I'm only 5'4\" (5'6\" in my heart) and felt like bending down to get to the washroom. lol."}
{"text":"Came here for friend's birthday celebration. Waiter gave us a starter shots and we like it so much that we end up ordering some more. I forgot what it was call. This place has two levels and we sat at the second level which was a nice quiet place for dinner. I also forgot what I ordered since it's had been a month already but I remembered it was great. Overall place and service were excellent."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely ruined my friends birthday tonight. And in my books wins the worst service ever medal... Our dinner lasted from 8pm to midnight and most of the time we were waiting for food ( which was less than average). We requested the bill around 10... Didn't come until 11.30 as 2 of our waitresses couldn't figure out who to charge what for an hour and a half for the party of 10. Bitter bitter experience. Such a shame."}
{"text":"I had read all of the previous reviews of Sidecar before I finally managed to haul my butt in there so I had a level of expectation and sometimes that can be the kiss of death for a restaurant. I'm pleased to say that Sidecar didn't miss a beat on meeting my expectations. It was a glorious, warm summer evening and I suggested to my out of town friend that we stop for dinner. It was early so it wasn't busy yet and the host was so kind enough to walk us through the whole restaurant.   I must say the patio is absolutely one of the loveliest I've seen along the Little Italy strip. They had what appeared to be large triangles of a parachute material tarp ed up over the patio, billowing in the breeze. What a beautiful spot and a five star date spot, hands down. It was muggy and warm though so we opted to sit inside. I'm a cocktail diva, love 'em to death, and Sidecar delivers well with the cocktails. I started with a lemony ginger cocktail (similar in style to what I had at the Black Hoof) and then followed that with their house speciality cocktail, the Bad Ass Mojhito.  Oh yeah baby, it lived up to its name. They use that high octane rum and I felt it. What sets this Mohjito apart, besides the fact you can't put it near an open flame, is that they also mash up some raspberries into the glass which temper some of the bitterness of the mashed mint.   Since it was Friday evening we couldn't take advantage of the Price Fixe menu (that is only Mon to Wed). OK, wanna guess what I ordered? :) Yup, that's right folks, the usual Steak Frites. Kudos to the kitchen for not salting those frites to death. Steak was exactly as I ordered it, medium rare. My friend ordered the Penne Bolognese and I consider myself a Bolognese expert so my take on the Bolognese was that it was good. Better than what most restaurants serve up but the waiter didn't come around with Parmesan for pasta and that was a small faux pas. We shared a starter salad which was an Arugula Salad with orange (they peeled all the skin off them....nice touch), finely chopped black olives and some Pecorino shaved on top, dressed with a lovely, tangy light vinaigrette. The kitchen was kind enough to divide the salad on separate plates for us, another nice touch. By the way, one of the most delicious breads in a basket on the table I've ever indulged in. Warm, crispy, yellowy in colour and with lots of texture, cornmeal on the base.   We didn't have any dessert. A girl can only shovel in so much food in one sitting. They do offer an interesting coffee service. They served our Americano in those tall glasses that sit inside the metal holders (similar to Russian tea glasses) and instead of sugar they use a sugar syrup. Check out the pics, you'll see a little glass of a clear fluid (no folks, it isn't Sambuca! :) They put a few little ice cubes in to the coffee as well to slightly cool it. Nice touches like this go a long way with me .   Service was great, mind you, it wasn't really busy yet but in some restaurants that doesn't matter, you could be the only in the place and still get ignored. The staff, including the bartender, the hostess, our waiter all spoke with us. I appreciated that effort on their part.  I'd go back to Sidecar in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday dinner. The place is very small and intimate which was nice because I didn't have yo shout across the table of the group of 10 or so we were with. The service was really good. The food was vent better. A bit pricey but well made. I ordered salmon for $18 bucks. I was expecting like a side of rice or something but it came with just a slab of salmon lol. Normally in this situation i would be a little pissed off, but the salmon was very large and the sauce that was on it and all over my plate was sooooo good I would have got a second! everyones food came out good. Most people got steak and frites which looked equally as delish! The wine was really good, I had some red (cant remember which) but it was smooth.  The atmosphere was really neat. They have stone walls in a portion of the restaurant which really gives it that authentic feel. Like this place has history and isnt some manufactured restaurant. It has feeeeel to it which I found very calming. It has that \"you can relax here\" vibe which is something i really appreciate restaurants take into consideration in there design.   I would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of this place.  Went there last night, my 2nd time. Absolutely amazing food,and great service.  The first time I went, I had crab cakes, with the lamb.  Best lamb I have had in a long time!  This time, I had the pre-fixe meal, Caesar, Roasted Chicken and Ganache chocolate cake.  It was just perfect.  The ambiance was great as well.  Small place but not as noisy as I would have thought it would be.  There are tables, obviously, or you can sit at the bar and chat it up with the Bartender.  They also have a small patio, that fills up quickly so make sure to reserve in the summer.  There is also an upstairs, however I have yet to visit that.  I highly recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Sidecar was aggressively unremarkable, and very much in the butter-and-salt school of cooking.  The menu was quite ordinary, with nothing new, compelling, original or light.  Which may have been fine, if the food had been executed in some extraordinary way.  Our salad was a crunchy iceberg chopped salad with a sort of creamy dressing.  It was fine, but not a $10 salad, and sort of a retro recipe all around.  It would have been at home in a fine Italian establishment in the 1960s.  I was concerned the risotto would be quite rich, which my server confirmed; she suggested the salmon as a lighter option.  The salmon came, atop a wad of steamed spinach that resisted easy cutting, and swimming in a glistening pool of butter sauce.  The salmon was indeed moist because, well, it was swimming in butter.  The service was indifferent, though never unfriendly.  Cocktails ran up to $14, and my 6 oz. club soda was $2.50 and there clearly were not going to be refills.  Our table was very close to the tables on either side, and the room we were in was quite warm.  A jazz duo started playing near the end of our meal, and that was quite lovely.  The room itself was cozy and inviting, so in that regard it was a pleasant place to be.  Those who enjoy a very traditional meal served in traditional, old fashioned high-fat style will have a pleasant evening at Sidecar."}
{"text":"I only came here for late night drinks so if you're looking for a review on their food, skip my post!  My girlfriends and I came here after reading about all the great reviews here and decided to try it for ourselves. We sat at the bar and was served by an extremely friendly bartender (who even offered to charge my phone after overhearing me talking about the low battery life I had).  Their drinks are delicious and I would highly recommend the French 75. In fact, I had 3 of those that night! My friend also got their Mojito and asked for alcohol to be added in there and she loved it as well (although it was extremely strong)."}
{"text":"This was a sigularly phenomenal experience. All of our food was lick-your-plate excellent. I love their investment in local food producers. Their housemade breads, butters, pastas totally show it. We also were treated to a random complimentary amuse-bouche of a pork terrine with caramelized onions on crostini. Vanilla creme brulee was the single best creme brulee I've ever had--PERFECTLY burnt sugar. Truly amazing prices for food this good.  ONLY down thought? Cocktails are expensive and taste like actual booze. Given that I'm normally a fruity liqour drinker, they were hard drinks to swallow! A connoisseur might feel differently. [Had Autumn sidecar/dark & stormy]"}
{"text":"Went here for my hubby's birthday last night (Fri Aug 26) and we were 11 in total. Really happy that they didn't need a credit card to reserve for a big party and that they were able to accommodate for separate bills at the end of the night, hassle free.   Atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Service was pleasant but kind of lacked. Maybe because of the gratuity free/hospitality included rule so no extra effort was made.   Food was okay for the most part. The Spaghettini and Linguini were super salty!!! Everything else on the menu were nothing special. Menu prices are decent but food didn't satisfy. Drinks were great and expensive.  All-in-all it was an okay experience and probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Sidecar has great service and the food is pretty good.   My friends and I got the halibut, risotto and steak frites. Everything was done well, but the food itself was not memorable. Therefore, I think the prices are a little high for something that isn't overly special.  I recommend going to Sidecar if you have a little cash to burn and you want to have a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Great steak frites and friendly service. Fantastic patio. Prix fixe is a S T E A L. Can I get an amen??"}
{"text":"Well worth it.  Ok, so this place is not the 18 course meal place that had the delicious sea snails with algae foam. However, Sidecar gets five stars for matching great food with value and service.    I have eaten here a few times.  Go during the week when they offer a three-course menu for 25$.  If you like to eat later, Sidecar is open later than many places during the week.  In fact, just after nine street parking is free, and the crowd is usually thinning.  For the first course, the Sidecar Salad is amazingly delicious and generously portioned.  For the second course the fish (I had trout) was perfectly prepared and served with Israeli couscous. Finally, I had a cheesecake, as well as a few bites of a chocolate dessert that were spot on.  The bar serves unique cocktails, as well as more common ones.  Try the sidecar.  The restaurant is located amongst a festive stretch of bars, shops, and restaurants. Great for window shopping and people watching on a nice weather evening."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday for the special prix menu. I decided on the regular menu's seafood linguine which was okay, just slightly bit sour from the lemon. I wish I had gotten my bf's chicken dish on the prix menu b/c it was SO JUICY. Their Caesar salad also possibly the best I've ever had + the hummus dip for the bread. Our server was also very nice."}
{"text":"A great date place....romantic, warm, lovely.....this is the place where my hubby and I ended up \"meeting\"....the food was really good, although there was nothing that was very memorable that meant that we'd *have* to go back...but it is a lovely ambiance for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Had a 9pm reservation on Dec 31st.   The restaurant was already almost full, however we were taken quickly to our table, and our jackets were taken by staff. Great Start.  Well lit, staff were smiling, nice mix of contemporary and old world charm.  I was dubious of the service we were going to get because a) it was NYE and b) this is a no tip restaurant.  The service could not have been better, no joke every single person we interacted with were just excellent.    The service in fact was better than most 'tipping' restaurants, I would put this service in amongst the best in the city.  Ordered the Tartare, 2 bottle of Red, the Steak/Frites and the lemon tart - all of them were excellent.  I would not hesitate for a second to eat here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sidecar last night. Sat at a table on the patio. Beautiful evening and meal. Had the duck confit gnocchi which was absolutely fabulous! So so tasty. Hubby had the rainbow trout in butter sauce which was also really good but portion could have been bigger. Cocktails were great too - had the Old Cuban and the Dark and Stormy. Overall it was a great night and I highly recommend checking out Sidecar! Yum!"}
{"text":"We got crab cakes to start and I got the steak frites as the main and substituted the fries for a Caesar salad. Personally I found the steak a bit dry but it was flavoured well. The salad didn't have much dressing either - I appreciate light dressing but I just felt like I was eating plain lettuce leaves.   Food tastes good here but the reason I knocked off a few stars is due to the slow service and the fact that my steak was a bit dry. Otherwise, I would recommend people to try this place as my friend said the rack of lamb is amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and our cousins had dinner at Sidecar the other week. We were impressed by the care in which the food was prepared and served. Our waiter was originally at Auberge du Pommier and his professionalism really shone. I really liked that the cutlery was removed and replaced after the appetizers... a small but significant act that is lacking in most restaurants these days.   As previous reviewers have noted, the bread is fabulous, baked on premises. I believe they even churn their own butter.  I had the Papardelle with short ribs which was melt-in-your mouth scrumptious. My cousins had the Shrimp Risotto and the Steak Frites, both of which they loved. My husband had the fish of the day, pickerel I think, which he thought was wonderful... and he is quite critical.  All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine dining experience in a casual setting with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim when looking for a place to go out for Sunday dinner. So glad we decided to try it!  Their prix fixe menu that is available Sunday through Wednesday really can't be beat. $25 for a full size app, main and dessert that if ordered individually would run you close to $45. Amazing food quality.  I had the romaine heart salad with the crispy chicken main, my husband had puree of mushroom soup with ravioli. We both were very pleased with our meals, but agreed mine won for the best entree of the evening.  They have a very large drink menu, with some interesting sounding cocktails, however we just had wine, so cannot comment to their taste.  I would advise not coming here if you are in a hurry, as the appetizers came out very quickly, even before our bottle of wine was served, however it took approximately 25 minutes from completion of courses for the next ones to be served... That would be my only complaint. It is probably largely due to the fact that a single waitress is responsible for serving and clearing 40-50 seats on her own.  That is my only reason for not a giving a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was excellent. We ordered from the Prix Fixe menu and were very happy. The waitress had a really good wine suggestion.   I would definitely go again. The only downside was the basement washroom. There was no ventilation and the smell was quiet unpleasant. I hope it was a one-off and that they are in the process of fixing it. Otherwise we had a great time."}
{"text":"I must admit, Sidecar was not our first choice while looking for dinner one Sunday night. I went through a slew of places I had bookmarked to try downtown, all closed on Sundays. We decided to park near College & Bathurst & walk up College for some options. When we neared Sidecar I had vaguely remembered that they offered Prix Fixe menus on Sundays, so we decided to pop in here to check it out.  It's a nice little restaurant, and the very formally dressed waiters made my boyfriend and I feel a bit under-dressed. Service was very good all night. Lots of knowledge and recommendations! I tried out the following with the $25 Prix Fixe menu (what-a-deal, by the way!):  Potato & Leek Soup: Very yummy & came with a scrumptious dollop of sour cream on top. Steak Frites: Good, though I felt a bit under-seasoned and a tad more rare rather than medium-rare - but I'm just nit picking here, it was still a good steak! My boyfriend mentioned that the Frites were some of the best he has tasted! It came with some garlic aioli that was quite tasty. Flourless Chocolate Cake with Salted caramel sauce, brandied cherries: Normally, anytime I see \"salted caramel\" I dive right in. This was a tiny piece of heavenly decadence. It was very rich, and very, very delicious. My words don't do it justice - try it out! I was about ready to lick the plate when we were done!  My boyfriend didn't go with the prix fixe since he shared my app & dessert, and he went with the Ravioli, which he really liked, but felt the portion size was a bit small.  I ended up being very glad that the other restaurants we had wanted to try were closed, because Sidecar ended up being quite a delightful little experience!"}
{"text":"No change in rating. Still believe that Sidecar is an awesome establishment. Ditto goes for Negroni just down the street.  I met the owner at a function last Saturday, and it was so cool to meet an entreprenuer that believes in a craft, such as making quality cocktails.   Can't wait to try more cocktails when his joint venture \"Toronto Temperance Society\" opens in July!"}
{"text":"I went to Sidecar for my birthday last month.  I booked this place the day before my party, luckily they were able to accommodate my seven guests and I.  I chose this place because I was aiming for a place with an outdoor patio.  We were seated at the backyard patio and the atmosphere  a nice atmosphere.  Their menu is pretty limited and I ordered the Steak Frites (AAA 8oz striploin, hand cut fried, roasted garlic aioli).  It taste alright - nothing really special.  The menu includes tax and gratitude so it end up being $24.   I would actually give this 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place because I was looking for an establishment with an option to sit at the bar and have a bite! Win win!!!! It was yummalicious. Had the salmon and it was succulent. Great seasonings. Staff was nice. Bartenders 1st night and pleasant. Would definitely go back an try some of the other deelish dishes. Great spot! Check it out..."}
{"text":"Salmon was a good portion. Service and prices are not bad at all! Great ambiance and feel."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  Staff is fast and attentive and the food is very good. One of the best Cesar salads in the city.  The meats are of the utmost quality and cooked to perfection.  Wine list was good, but could have a bit more variety.  They have a great prix fixe menu as well."}
{"text":"Came back, almost a year to the day, but not quite as good as the first time.    Sat on the patio out back this time, which was very nice.  Service was just as attentive as before, but not necessarily friendly.  Oh well.  We ordered an Old Fashioned each, which is probably the best in the city in my opinion, but they seem to have increased the price on it by quite a bit from before (around $15+ compared to $10 last time).  So sad :(  Free bread is always appreciated.  Came with a hummus spread.  Very tasty!  Had the Beef Carpaccio again (increased to $14 from $12 last time), and it was pretty good, not great.  We each went with pasta, Seafood Linguini, which unfortunately was over salted, and too oily.  The seafood in the dish was great, but the noodles just didn't cut it with the above mentioned problems, so I barely ate any.  They did hook us up with some complimentary ice wine at the end, which was a nice touch.  More places need to do this kind of thing.  Had it not been for this and the bread, the star rating would be a bit worse.  All-in-all, I was disappointed compared to the previous visit.  The price increases and the food just didn't cut it.  I'll still give this place another chance in the future, but not for a while.  TL:DR Atmosphere/Decor = 4/5 (It's a bit cramped in places) Service = 3.5/5 (Could be friendlier) Food = 2.5/5 (Sadly, a bit of a miss this time) Value = 3/5 (Too many price increases!) Overall = 3(ish)/5"}
{"text":"Five stars for their set menu served Sun to Wed dinners for $25. Great value and it's really good.   Walked in on a Sunday night for the 5 pm seating, few tables there, ambiance is nice though their main floor is pretty small. I later discovered they have seating upstairs as well.   My party ordered eat of the three choices for starters. Their salads were really tasty, the ceasar had real strips of bacon bits tossed in and the sauce was just right not over powering. The butternut squash soup was excellent. I wanted more.   The steak was a thick baseball cut. Ordered a medium - bad move. Cut into it and it was still too bloody. No fret, sent it back in and told them I wanted medium well instead. When it came back out, it was perfect. So *note* if you usually get medium elsewhere, get med well here. Steak served with a huge heaping of string fries, pretty good and garlic mayo. We all got the steak so unfortunately I don't know how the other options taste like...  Dessert was pumpkin pie or for $1 extra, you can pick from the other choices. I went for the cheesecake which was served with berries, raspperry compote, and whipped cream. It was average. We also got the flourless chocolate cake - didn't like so much but the pumpkin pie was absolutely perfect. Might be the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. Seriously so good!   I would totally recommend this resto! Service was friendly and before 7pm, it was really fast but once people start filling the place for the 7pm seating, service became a tad bit slower."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  The recipes are interesting but not crazily complicated, and everything tastes amazing!  The staff is also very attentive to you all meal, but not hovering or anything.  It's a small, narrow room, however, so on busy nights you're touching outer thighs with your neighbour so it's not exactly the best place for an intimate evening.  You won't, however, be at all disappointed with the great eats."}
{"text":"Just amazing was there about a month ago haven't had time to post we had the steak frites n pumpkin tart ... Amazing food amazing ambiance n great service !"}
{"text":"Great place all around! I came with a friend  for dinner on Friday. When I phoned to make a reservation they informed me that there was another reservation for our table in 2 hours and asked if it was okay. I appreciated them letting me know up front, so it wouldn't be like they were kicking us out.   The room is simple and cozy. It's a classy restaurant but they didn't give us attitude for looking young and student-y. (In fact, they offered to store my friend's huge backpack in the wardrobe at the front).  We started with cocktails. I had the Mayweather (gin, cava, blueberry puree). Amazing.  Next, we both had the tomato soup, which was pretty damn good too! My friend was raving about it for the rest of the night. For the main course, I had the mushroom risotto which was rich and creamy.   This is a great place to enjoy good food with friends.   The only awkward part was when the young couple sitting next to us started taking tons of photos. Now, I'm known to take a food photo once in a while too (so I can post them on yelp!), but they were taking several photos of the restaurant, many of which I think I ended up being in:S The flash was really distracting, but mostly it was just funny!! Obviously they liked Sidecar too."}
{"text":"Dinner here was an absolute treat. We arrived ten minutes late for a reservation (it was pretty full on a Thurs) and our table wasn't quite ready. We sat at the bar and were treated to sparkling wine on the house. Our table took maybe five minutes more.   Once seated we chose to chat for 15 minutes before opening the menu. Our waiter was extremely patient and courtious. The rest of the meal was the same, attentive staff and very nice and tasty food.   I don't want to gloss over the food because it was very good but I really feel my experience was that much more enjoyable because of the service.   If you're looking for a nice meal where you can eat over 2+ hours (and not feel rushed) try Sidecar and please be sure to let them know you appreciate the service."}
{"text":"After many positive reviews on this place, I decided to try it, especially for their prix fix menu. At $25, available Sunday - Wed  - it was really hard NOT to like this place.  What I had: Sidecar salad, Steak Frites, and chocolate cake for dessert.  The sidecar salad was delicious - lots and lots of chopped corn, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese all tossed in a creamy salad dressing. It was surprisingly tasty!  The steak frites were alright - I'm a bit of a steak snob so I'm quite hard to please in this arena, but for the price, it was pretty good.  The chocolate cake was good... but i was so stuffed by this point I could barely finish it.  Overall, a great value for dinner in Little Italy. The drinks and service were also good, as was the ambience. It is a bit small and tends to get busy, so make resos if you have your heart set on coming."}
{"text":"A fun night out at the side car.  I love this place for a casual night out with a simple meal in mind.  Great wine selection from local to old world  with my favourite Cave Springs Selections.   I am also a big fan of the Q water they serve for $1 a head for unlimited sparkling or flat water that is filtered and taste great.   The new menu has some mix results.  The Tuna Sashimi was very nice with thick pieces of seared Tuna. The salad needs a different dressing. Current one is too creamy that drowns the gentle tuna.  The salads were tasty and great portion.  What I noticed that need to cut down on the house salad dressing and get a few different options.  It's a similar creamy dressing on most of them.   The entrées were for the most part really good. The salmon was done well with excellent sides, the Lamb had an crust that was crunchy and added new texture to a classic dish. The mushroom pasta was excellent in presentation and taste. The fail was my shrimp spaghetti which was the low point of my dinner. There was maybe 2-3 shrimp in the pasta that were so small I couldn't find them. Otherwise the dish would have been worth ordering.   Service was really good. Attentive and quick. Service came out at the perfect pace and kept us wanting more."}
{"text":"If you were to order one dish at this restaurant, go for the steak frities.  After reading the reviews, I was slightly wary about jumping on the bandwagon and I'm definitely glad that I did.  The meat was nice and tender and the fries were nicely toasted and salted.  Amazing combination I must admit.  My fellow diner had the Fettucini which she said was mediocre.  I had taste of the dish as well and the shrimp had a slightly off-taste to it.  Definitely wasn't a stand out dish by far.   Service was good and the wine selection was on-par, not amazing but it served the purpose.    I didn't get a chance to try out the cocktails but from the looks of it, sounds like a good place for cocktails.  In terms of seating however, the tables are all quite crammed together so it was like being in a sardine can with your neighbours.  Not bad if you're looking for that type of vibe, but seemed like the owner tried to pile in as many tables as possible.  The prix fixe menu is definitely a seller, so overall, not a bad restaurant.  Go for steak frites, avoid the fettucini at all costs."}
{"text":"What a charming place for a (first or 400th) date.  The back patio was cool, shaded and had a European charm with white tableclothes and twinkling patio lights over creeping ivy and trees. It was busy, but quiet enough to have a conversation with my date and not shout over other tables nearby.  I had originally picked the spot due to the fantastic-sounding cocktail lineup, and I wasn't disappointed - there's really something for everyone. They also carry raspberry wheat beer and an array of different lagers and ales that, while not extensive, will offer something to every type of beer drinker. The food was also fantastic, and a good sized portion despite being a little pricy for what you get. It's quality over quantity at Sidecar."}
{"text":"4/5. A bit salty on the steak but really good otherwise. Service was snappy and un-intrusive.  Prix fix menu was a screaming deal for the amount of food served up.   Wine is reasonable - after living in Vancouver past year - it was nice to see decent bottles under the $50 mark."}
{"text":"I loved it here. If you are looking for a classy place to take a date then this is the place to do it. I've only been for drinks and it definitely not your average bar menu.  I would like to note that the place can be VERY steep but its worthwhile once in a while."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but Italian only in that there were 3 pasta and 2 risotto dishes on the menu... the ingredients in those dishes were, for the most part, not Italian... the fish weren't traditional Italian fish, and weren't prepared in a way that could be described in any sense as Italian... they serve steak frite, for crying out loud.... I ordered sea bass that was not sea bass, cooked a bit dry, in way too much butter, with an overwhelming champagne mignonette, served with bland overgrown green beans and sauteed fingerling potatoes that were overcooked. Dessert was an \"apple crumble\" that was actually a Dutch apple pie - and it was okay-not-great, and not even made in house. That's cheating.  Our server was either on his first night ever working in a restaurant, or lives in a halfway house. Every question we asked (7, about the dishes, the winelist, and the coffee) he said \"I don't know, I'll have to ask the owner.\" The owner did know the answers.  The space was crowded on a night when most of the other restaurants we walked past were not even half-full. Maybe people are coming here for the cocktails (ours, made with brandy, apricot brandy, and egg, was interesting but overspiced with nutmeg). Don't come here looking for interesting or exciting or well-prepared food, and certainly don't come here for the service."}
{"text":"Pricey is fine if I love what I get; unfortunately, I did not.  The drinks, although good, were a little too expensive. My girlfriends mojito was far too packed with mint leaves - now, someone might prefer that, but for us, continually picking out huge chunks of mint leaves takes the fun out of the drink.  Bread could have been warmer.  My steak was good and cooked as I asked, but the rest of the food didn't blow me away - salad, soup, frites.   Overall, solid service but didn't make up for the mediocre food at the price we paid for it.  After all the hype, we walked away a little disappointed and probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"After finding Sidecar on yelp and reading the positive reviews, I organized a group birthday dinner here. We came here last night, Saturday, as a group of six women and everything was fabulous.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and offered to have our coats taken, and were seated at the front end of the restaurant; the ambiance was casual elegance.  Two types of warm fresh bread was served. Their amuse bouche of mini bruschetta-like bites, which had an unexpected kick of heat, was delicious.  A couple of us shared a bottle of red wine; the table's water and wine glasses were always filled without asking and the food arrived timely.  Most of the table ordered the steak frites and enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the braised lamb shank, so soft and falling off the bone, served with asparation and mashed yellow turnip.  For dessert, I had asked our server to bring out the flourless chocolate cake with a lit candle for the birthday celebrant as a surprise.  It was served with a couple of slices of banana and chocolate sauce and was amazingly really good!   We all ordered lattes to go with the dessert which were great to finish off our meal.  All in all, our evening at Sidecar was perfect.  Great ambiance, good food served timely, great value, and I can honestly say I can't think of one complaint.   What really put this review over the top to a five star was definitely the fantastic service from arrival to the end of the night, particularly for a group.  In addition, we were never made to feel rushed despite the busy Saturday night and eventhough I knew there was a group seating after us which they mentioned when I booked the reservation. Thank you, Sidecar, for making our birthday celebration so enjoyable."}
{"text":"A friend of mine loves this place and so our entire group has been coming here for quite a little while now. The interior is nice, but the patio is really warm and ambient during the summers. It's got a 'just enough' vibe to it. Just enough to be considered nice, but not too much to be considered douchey.    I have to say, the food is always excellent, the price to value quotient is amazing, and the food is always hella tasty. The service has never been bad.   The Sidecar salad is something i like to go back for. My last visit the chef prepared a duck that has honestly been the best duck dish i've ever had...and only for $24.  All in all, Sidecar is just one of those restaurants i can keep going back to, and never get disappointed by. It's a great place to catch up with friends, to go on  a date, to take parents and in laws to, and everyone will be impressed. They can accomodate groups pretty well, so it would be a perfect birthday dinner spot too since you're right in little italy."}
{"text":"Part of my birthday crawl, so take the review with a grain of salt. That meaning I wasn't sober. Here's what I do remember...  Cool looking place. Nice decor.  Nice staff. Friendly.  A yummy chocolate cake. Very rich. Yum yum yum!  A tasty drink called the \"_____ Gin Fizz\" that was just the right amount of bitter, sweet, and lemony. And gin.  Lovely company.   I'll be back. Everyone else was getting food that looked just scrumptious! Oh and I guess I should try a Sidecar next time I'm back too."}
{"text":"Sidecar Beep Beeped and Toot Tooted right into my heart. But it wasn't perfect. By any means, so lets get the bad out of the way first; on my anniversary dinner with my sweetheart, I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and the dish was served to me piping hot, artisanaly covered in their Dijon sauce and also completely and unmistakably raw in the middle. Now don't get me wrong, I can get jiggy with raw fish, throw a piece of sushi grade salmon sashimi at me and I will catch that shit with my mouth like a performing seal at Marineland, but on that particular night, I was not in the mood for some raw-ass fish - I wanted a hearty meal, as I read the menu, saw the Atlantic salmon and fantasized about flakey, juicey delectable salmon all up in my mouths.  But I didn't get that. The parts of the salmon that were cooked (the ends) were fabulous, and I ate those, but I had to leave a huge chunk in my plate. And this is where Sidecar stole my heart again...The server noticed that I left half my raw fish on the plate, and asked if anything was the matter, and in my long winded and adorable way, I explained how bummed I was about the fish being pretty raw. She listened patiently and intently, apologized about the circumstance and whisked my plate away. Shortly after, she comes back to the table and notifies me that the salmon will be comped. Yipee! I would have preferred some nice salmon to shoddy raw-ish salmon, but Sidecar service made up for my underwhelming main.  Their pistachio cannoli also had TOO MANY FUCKING RAISINS IN IT (Vomit) so I basically had to choke those down.  And the server then just checked out and took like what felt like 2 hours to fulfill our bill (we had to flag her down and ask for it)  BUT, the ambiance at Sidecar is truly stupendous and to repeat, the service is generally stellar. I tried to book online for a table at 7, and there weren't any, so I called in and the lovely gentleman was able to squeeze me an my partner for that time slot (Go you reservation booking dude!) We arrived and our coats were swiftly taken and we were seated, drink orders were taken and fulfilled, app orders placed, and soon enough we  were slurping down fresh oysters and inhaling their crab cakes (those crab cakes are finger-licking deep fried morsels of true happiness).  I ordered their Sazarac (pretty much only for the absinthe...) which came in the cutest little old timey bottle and a vintage glass, the drink was strong and tasty.  I sampled the sweethearts Steak Frites and Creme Brulee and that shiz was TOP NOTCH."}
{"text":"2 years of visiting my wife in toronto & trying to find the perfect spot & this place hit the ball out of the park on every level. this review basically rates both sidecar & the upstairs \"private\" bar, the toronto temperance society. robin, the bartender, is likely the greatest mixologist i've ever met, & hey, i work in the service industry in new york city, so that's saying something. every drink was well thought out, creative, delicious, wonderfully balanced, & tailored directly to the individual's tastes (we went 3 times, first time with a party of 4). along with his artistry in drinks, he was helpful, informative, accommodating, & friendly. the perfect bartender.  even aside from my bar snobbery, the food was terrific. we sampled most of the appetizers in our handful of visits, each one refreshing, piquing our taste buds for the main event yet leaving plenty of room for what was to come. i found myself returning to the beautifully seasoned & cooked steak frites. decor & atmosphere were on par with the quality of the service & food / drinks. low-key but tasteful, & they had a pretty killer soul music playlist going the last time i was there.  overall, a real treasure. a sparkling gem of toronto night life."}
{"text":"The patio tacked in the back of this little restaurant on College is its the best feature. It evokes old-world charm - climbing plants, wooden tables, palatine...The service is polite, but impersonal, the food... hit and miss. The mushroom soup was good, as were the fries and the salads, but the star of the plate - the steak was so-so at best.   One thing everyone at our table of six noticed: the cooks at Sidecar are not too shy with the salt. Everything, absolutely everything was over salted. Thankfully, the waiter came around with the water refills every 5 minutes.   Regardless of how you've ordered it, all our steaks were medium rare. Could feel a strong pepper aftertaste too. All in all, not the worst steak I ever ate, but not the best either.   The dish that almost killed the dinner for me was the flourless torte. It tasted as if a ball of butter (margarine, maybe?) married a big chunk of baking chocolate. Not sexy."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch Saturday so when we came here for dinner, I wasn't too hungry and therefore ordered 2 appetizers: Fois Gras and the Crab Cakes.  Unbelievably amazing!  Both of my favourites made to perfection.  My friend had a steak dinner which I tried a piece of and the steak was so juicy (next time I am ordering this as well).  My other friend ordered the oysters which I tried one for the very first time.  Delicious! He also ordered the spicy spaghetti which was really good!  Service was excellent and the atmosphere was great.  Had a few special cocktails later on which were Superb!"}
{"text":"A lot has changed since I was last at Sidecar, and this being my 4th visit since my original review I think I owe it an update.  First, let's talk about Graham.  He has been my waiter a few times and served us last night.  He was amazing.   Specifically: - He knows every detail and nuance of the menu including how the food is prepared.  Susan asked about the pasta sauce and he knew aspect of its preparation down to it being thickened with butter and not flour or starch.  I think he probably came in early and milled the flour himself. - He was an attentive listener and thought about what we were saying - for example, I asked to have a different dressing on the Romain hearts salad and he said that of course, I could have any dressing I wanted.  When I said I didn't care which one but wanted an oil based dressing he advised that there wasn't any dairy in the one that it came with if that was the basis of my concern.  It was, and I was glad he told me that because it was totally the right dressing for that salad and I'm glad I got to have it.  I think most servers would have said okay, and brought the oil dressing which wound't have been as good. - He cleared the table and asked us if we needed our drinks refreshed at the right times.  He never interrupted if we were in the middle of a conversation and he was great at showing up enough, but without imposing. Susan and Wendy didn't even notice him when he stealthily replaced their silverware between courses.  He was like a fork ninja.  The food: Last time I was here and had the steak frites, I wasn't really feeling it.  It was a LOT better yesterday.  It was smaller and taller and that really worked for me.  It was cooked exactly to order, and there was nothing about this plate that I didn't like.  This was vastly improved from last time I had their steak.  Everyone else loved their food too.  Kat destroyed her hand cut pasta in 5 minutes flat (it was an impressive feat to see that bowl empty that fast) and the sidecar salads got the thumbs up from everyone.  I didn't like the flourless chocolate cake we had for dessert, but that's a personal taste preference, there was nothing wrong with it.    The drinks: The drinks are always the real selling features of this place for me.  I stick to my tried and true favorites, the sidecar and the bad ass mojito.  The Manhattans were a big winner with the table yesterday and really, all of the drinks are nothing short of excellent so you could pretty well close your eyes and point to one at random and be happy.  The Best: The best thing about Sidecar is that it easily earns its place on my list of \"Places I had a Great Time.\"  I always have a great time here; there has never been an exception."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Sidecar I found my steak to be chewy, and the dessert dry. But the bread was delicious; the salad fresh with just the right amount of dressing, and crispy croutons, and the coffee refills were a perfect addition to the warm bread. So I got a group together and paid them another visit. Making the reservations for a group was pretty straightforward, and the menu for $25 was hard to beat.  $25 Prix Fixe Available from Sunday - Wednesday  Appetizers Daily Soup Made daily from seasonal ingredients  Mixed Greens Fresh baby greens, ripe cherry tomatoes, crisp onion and red wine vinaigrette  Romaine Hearts Fresh hearts of romaine, pancetta, garlic butter croutons Caesar vinaigrette  Mains Rigatoni Grilled eggplant, yellow zucchini, roasted peppers in a spicy tomato ragu with pecorino  Atlantic Salmon Browned tender filet, dijon honey glaze white wine butter sauce  Pan Roasted Chicken Crispy half chicken, smashed buttery fingerlings, fresh asparagus, natural jus  Steak Frites Grilled 8oz top sirloin hand cut golden frites & sriracha aioli  Dessert Tiramisu  **Substitutions can be accommodated for a nominal fee of $2, $3 or $5 to account for more expensive items   The Good  The ambiance is lovely-modern, classy and clean They will accommodate a large group They kept refilling our coffee and bread The bread was amazing-warm with fresh butter on the side-so good! And I am not even a bread person! The coffee was also amazing!--I am a coffee person :) This time around the steak was cooked to perfection The frites had just the right amount of seasoning and were crispy on the outside and pillowy in the inside Loved the addition of the butter on the steak-gave it that extra kick of flavor  The Not-So-Good  Disliked the desserts the first time around, and we all disliked it the 2nd time. Yes, you can substitute the dessert, but we disliked them all. In comparison to their mains, the desserts needed work. Which is odd since they are doing such an amazing job with the bread!   At the end of dinner one of our waiters approached me and asked me if my friends and I only like to eat out if the meal is cheap? What kind of question was that? It was not only rude, but he also insulted the restaurant he works for by implying that they are cheap! Wow!  My dessert was missing an element, and when I asked the chef he told me he was going to get it for me-I told him I was going to take my dessert to-go, so I asked that he include it in the to-go container. On my way out I checked the to-go container and the missing piece was not in the box. I asked the chef again and he told me that they had run out. Was he going to tell me at all, or was he waiting for me to get home to find the piece missing? Personally I thought that was sneaky and unprofessional. If you can't deliver, then step-up and admit it.  In Sum  Though there were many hits, the overall experience left a lot to be desired... being called cheap, average desserts, and sneaky behaviour killed the experience for me. And no, I don't only go out for \"cheap\" meals! The nerve!  http://wp.me/p2mHMr-184"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few weeks ago and I was really impressed. We arrived without a reservation on a busy night, but they were able to accommodate us after a 15-20 minute wait at the bar. We didn't mind--sipped a primitivo while we waited, which was great. I was so happy to see one on the menu and ordered a bottle once we sat down.   Our server knew his shit and was just the right amount of attentive.   We had PEI oysters to start, which were delicious. Come to think of it, everything I tasted that night was delicious (the duck, steak frites, gnocchi).  And then there's the prices. This is one of the most reasonably priced restaurants I've been to in Toronto for what you get. And we didn't even do the prix fixe menu.   Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Totally delicious meal and awesome cocktails make for a great and memorable dinner.  Came here with a small group of friends (party of 4) after stupidly thinking that we could grab a table at Bar Isabel without reservations. But no matter, we had a great time and a great meal here and we're happy they could accommodate us on short notice...I imagine they must get a lot of spill over from Bar Isabel.  Started with some cocktails and an appetizer with the awesome complimentary bread. We're off to a good start! Drinks were really good and not overly pretentious like some cocktail bars. Solid and approachable classics done very well. Salmon tartare was delicious and the main entrees were even better. A couple of friends got the Prix Fixe (at a very good price of $25) and I got the scallops while the other friend got the lamb. The meal was A+ and I don't have anything bad to say about it. A totally satisfying meal with yummy boozy drinks made for a great night with friends.  Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening for the prixe fixe menu. Nice atmosphere, service, and food here. Slightly deceiving menu. (keep reading!)  It would be nice if they specified what the fish is on the menu.  (It is NOT Rainbow Trout!)    We tried the Caesar salad (excellent, but super heavy) and the sidecar salad (interesting, but I'm personally not a fan.. too much mayo and strange texture, but nice flavor).  My boyfriend LOVED the homemade bread!   My dining partner was very pleased with  Steak frites (it was perfectly cooked beef tenderloin).  I had the \"Rainbow Trout\".     The  only flavors I could taste in the fish were butter and honey-mustard, so I can't even say if they fish was tasty or not! (please put the exact type of  fish on your menu!)  Maybe most people would not be bothered by this, but I was.   For dessert we tried maple Creme brulee and the chocolate flour-less cake. Both were good, but mediocre. The creme brulee was too sweet and the texture wasn't to my preference   The cocktail (dark and stormy!) was the highlight of the meal.   This is a lovely place, especially for the prixe fixe!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I've been here a couple of times already and loved it. They change their menu since I last went (which was a long time ago) so some things I got that loved weren't on it but that's ok because they had other good things.  Unfortunately, I hadn't planned to go here (but to some pub nearby based on a friend's suggestion), so I had eaten beforehand. Had I known I'd be eating here instead I would've starved myself till dinner! I ate a cheese plate only but that was delicious.  Their cocktails are delicious! I love the giant ice cube. I haven't been able to stop thinking about the Vieux Carré cocktail. At $13 a cocktail better be amazing, and it was.  The fries that came with the steak frites also came with black garlic aioli or something like that, and it was delicious.  Can't wait to go back, but hungry this time so I can actually eat a proper meal."}
{"text":"It was going to be a 30-35 minute wait for the long rumoured beautiful back patio, so we happily settled for a cozy little two-top. At 8:00pm on a Monday night, the long room was packed and boy, was I glad that my dinner date had had the foresight to make reservations.  To start, the classic gin martini ($12) and whisky cocktail ($10) came highly recommended and beautifully presented. From the three course prix fixe menu ($24): the decadently thick mushroom soup was highlighted with hints of black pepper, the generous piece of salmon grilled to medium-rare (on request) perfection sat atop of a lemony hollandaise-like sauce, and the flourless chocolate cake was more like a perfectly sweetened creamy mousse. Our server who only caught bits and pieces of our conversation must've thought that we'd been chanting \"Wow, this is sooo good!\" all night.  The service was friendly and efficient from the moment I hungrily walked in the door to when we satisfyingly left. The warm lighting and steady conversational buzz from our dining neighbours made for a casually intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of girlfriends during Winterlicious last year - friendly (if slightly nervous) service, but very good-natured and eager to please.. Food was okay - may have been better on a non-Winterlicious night? Steak frites was meant to be the way to go - unfortunately my friend's steak wasn't cooked to order for her. Had a homemade fresh pasta which was delicious (though quite small). Feel like need to try this place again to see if they were just having an 'off' night (maybe for their excellent-sounding prix fixe set menu?) .. But then really good restaurants shouldn't ever have an 'off-night..' - right?"}
{"text":"Sidecar is a great little place, solid 4.5 star (just didn't quite have the WOW factor for a full 5).  They have a really beautiful patio out back which is a perfect place to dine, weather permitting. Otherwise the interior looked ok but not a lot of seating. Book in advance.  I had the daily soup to start, which was tomato that day. This was quite delicious and full of flavour.   I was feeling quite boring and unadventurous so I went ahead and ordered chicken for my main. It was nice and crispy and served over some sauteed green beans. This was a tasty dish but not very creative. Then again, chicken is usually the \"safe\" dish on the menu for picky eaters, so I shouldn't have expected something too unique.  The dessert that night was sticky toffee pudding. Again, this one was really good. The sauce was buttery and sickly sweet. It tasted heavenly.   Service was excellent here and the waiter was quite helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Good wine list and some great sounding (albeit pricey) cocktails."}
{"text":"Wow. I had no idea the dinner I would have here would be this delicious when I walked in.   My friend had found this place on Google and said it has potential, so we trekked here in the cold with a reservation on a Sunday night. Apparently you really should reserve in this not that tiny place because they do get busy and full. Luckily, their private dining area upstairs were not booked, so they made room for us. They led us back outside the front door, went to the staircase next door and entered a beautiful seating area complete with a fullbar and we were seated at a booth.  They have a very tiny menu and most of their entrees are $18. We had the Open shrimp ravioli and steak frites. Honestly, I can't describe this ravioli..it was more like large pieces of flat noodle with shrimp on top. The pasta was SO fresh cooked perfectly del dente and shrimp and sauce was absolutely mouthwatering. The steak was juicy and seasoned perfectly and cooked to order. The fries that came with steak was seasoned well and it also came with a special mayo that was a perfect complement.   For dessert we had their maple creme brulee, which was actually kind of disappointing. But I can't knock off a star for this because the entrees were THAT good.  Oh, let me not forget about the bread with the best crust i've ever eaten (i normally hate eating crust) that came with garlic butter. I had four pieces. I never eat bread.  We also ordered a bottle of Chianti, but unfortunately they were out and gave us something that was similar (forgot what). The wine, as recommended, was great. Our service was average, although I feel like it would have been better if our server wasn't the only person up in the private dining area who also tended the bar.  I hope to come back more often!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of nine, after making a booking, 8 of us arrived while the 9th was parking the car. Once we all sat down and told the waitress the 9th was parking,she set about removing his place setting. When he arrived not two minutes later, we had to request that she bring it back, about which she wasn't too impressed - sorry, he'll just stand outside then? Our waitress had a rare affliction called \"I'm having the worst time of my life in this job and as such, refuse to smile\".  Bread was good, and the wine list is great. We all (bar one, who regretted it later!) ordered the Prix Fixe and funnily enough all ordered the same thing. Butternut Squash which was delicious, with one person having the Romaine Hearts, very nice as well. The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned, french fries meh but it would have been really nice to have some greenery, maybe some beans or  something? Or the possibility or ordering side salads, but they're apparently not offered with the Prixe Fixe.  The desert, the flourless chocolate cake, damn, sugar coma. It was basically butter and cocoa powder whipped into a ganache triangle of doom with some salted caramel sauce (delicious but unfortunately scant) and two small berries. No one was able to finish it, it was so rich it was almost unpleasant. Almost. The wait between the main and dessert was about 50 minutes, which for a not busy Monday night was kind of frustrating, made more irritating by the moody patoody waitress.  Over all, if I'd been by myself or in a twosome I would have been a bit miffed, but I was with great company so all was forgiven."}
{"text":"sidecar hmm.. what to think of this name?? doesn't exactly gives us any idea that it's a stellar restaurant with awesome dishes, great ambience if you want to play lance romance, along with exceptional service. some might say its a simple menu comprising of only a few entrees but most interesting. I had the crispy suckling pig (baby pig) with some layered potatoes which I cant remember the name of but what a lovely dish it was. we shared all the apps amongst the group and was enjoyed by everyone which I thought was odd. no haters??? the sidecar salad was a hit although i didn't get to try it cause of my tomato  allergy. overall a great dining experience ill be back again soon"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Sidecar. From the bread basket with housemade whipped butter to my main, everything was wonderful. I can't remember exactly what I ordered (I think it was some sort of gnocchi dish), but I remember asking if it could be made meatless and my request was accommodated graciously. The food came out hot and delicious and the serving size was just right. The service was impeccable - water glasses continuously topped up, more bread offered when our basket was done, quick, kind and completely courteous. The space inside was dimly lit and quite romantic, a lovely spot for a date. I would most definitely return and pay full price, but am completely tempted by the $25 prix fixe dinner option...plus, as an added bonus, I love the ease of being able to make a reservation online!"}
{"text":"After much research I choose Sidecar for my fiance and I to celebrate our anniversary. First off, I was pleased with the pleasant, dimly lit atmosphere and courteous servers, but I have one complaint...   My fiance and I were clearly on a date and the restaurant was about a quarter full. Not only did they seat us next to a (very loud) table of 8, but the door to the adjacent Temperance League was on our other side so servers and patrons were coming in and out of this door the entire time.   Other then that the food was exceptional. We both had the pre-fixe menu. I had the Chicken Noodle soup followed by steak and frites. The soup was probably the second best chicken noodle I've ever had. Deceptively simply and gloriously flavourful. The steak was cooked just the way I asked and very tender. My fiance had the caesar salad (which comes with crispy pancetta that I now put on all the caesars I make at home) and the salmon which he really enjoyed. I actually wished I had ordered the salmon when I tried his, it had this fantastic maple glaze on it.   The pre-fixe comes with tiaramisu but they ran out so we had the flourless chocolate cake which was moist, rich, and tasty. I could barely finish it because I was so full from the meal.... which is a good thing!   I also tried their Sidecar cocktail which was perfect.   A good dining experience all around. My only wish is that the hostess had thought to seat us somewhere more private. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"We sat next to a large party on a weekend so it was very noisy. My friend. and I could barely hear each other speak and  the seats weren't very comfortable. But the quality of the food & the server more than made up for it. Next time I would probably want to eat upstairs at the Temperance club, the ambience is way more enticing. They didn't have frangelico though,  All in all the quality of their food is outstanding. For that reason,I will eventually go back for sure."}
{"text":"Caveat?  I've never eaten a bite of food at Sidecar.  Their menu looks attractive and the food I've seen gliding past me from the bar seems solid, but I first came to Sidecard because it's reputed as having some of the best cocktails in the city.  Its a reputation well-earned.  All molecular glory aside, I'd characterize Barchef as being largely defined by its house-made bitters and the creative application thereof.  The analogue at Sidecar is their narrow but wondrous arsenal of essential oils, which elevate classics like their Old Fashioned and their Boulevardier to stellar heights.  There isn't a ton of innovation going on here, but the level of balance, flavor, and craft renders innovation moot.  These are Prohibition-era (or older) cocktails done to a tee.  It's just one of the greatest places in the city for cocktails.  ...Seriously, it's the best Boulevardier I've ever had.  I'd delve deeper into their list of offerings if the damn thing wasn't perfection incarnate.  Go there, order one, and thank me later."}
{"text":"This week it seems like a Ton of places were closed for Reno. So I had to go down my to do list and try side car.  And boy am I happy I did. The patio was awesome, service was attentive , and even though they were busy the dishes came out fast. Tried the Ceviche that was on special( tuna , salmon and shramp) it was good. Had the duck, it was wicked. Added the optional foie GRAS which was dizzzzope. Drinks were really good( I suggest the mojito).  I even manage to score a drink from the special members only bar upstairs, that was awesome. Service was impeccable and it was great to eat on the patio (note: i started this review in august and just realize di hadnt published it)."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Dining here with out of town guests has become a tradition. Simple, well executed menu and fabulous staff, and, Without a doubt the best made Old Fashioned in the city."}
{"text":"I went here for a business dinner and the moment I walk in the door the wait staff was there to greet me.  I walked over to the bar, ordered \"The Sidecar\" (bet no one saw that one coming), loved it, I think I had another.  This place stood out to me; first place I have eaten at, in Toronto and it left me with a pleasant taste on my palate.  Atmosphere:  It was jumping my night, the tables were relatively full, the crowds were joyous, the lighting and decor added an air of a artsy sophistication.  Food:  Excellent!  I had the Shrimp Tempura and Crispy Oven-Roasted Chicken.  Everything was great and both come recommended by moi.  Service:  Very good.  Bartender was the best!  His name eludes me, but I believe it was Brian?  (sorta looked a bit Scottish to me)  He recommended having The Sidecar as well as, giving us Brandy Alexander cocktails which were fantastic!  He specifically stood out to me because of his attentive nature and interest in making a good impression on behalf of the restaurant.  Overall:  Overall, I totally suggest this place to friends who might be in the area, or flying in for a business trip like I did, but I especially recommend this to the locals who have yet to visit this excellent establishment."}
{"text":"My beef-centric meal of carpaccio and steak frites was really good. They did a great job cooking (or better yet, *not* cooking) the steak to a perfect rare. The carpaccio was good albeit a bit flavourless. I had the creme brulee for dessert which had an extra hard layer of caramel on it. Didn't necessarily like fruit they put on top. Didn't taste fresh. But otherwise, had a great time. Really nice meal and I'd absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Great little spot on college for a date. We came here with n the middle of a rain storm and opted for some dinner. Great service but a bit awkward. At times we felt like we were being ignored and weren't as important as other patrons."}
{"text":"Have been back several times now, to hang out with my pal Ufco behind the bar and also to gorge on the wonderful Sidecar Salad, and my experience holds strong at five stars!  I've gone for the $24 Prix Fixe, and while I fell in love with the Sidecar Salad, I didn't love the salmon entree. The portion is far too hefty to finish but it was undercooked, and as a new fish eater that sort of freaked me out. If I go back for it, I'll ask for it more well done.   OK, the salad: I don't even really like salad, but this one swept me off my feet! It has fresh corn kernels cut straight off the cob, cubed cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese and firm lettuce in a creamy oregano dressing. This is more of a \"wet\"/saturated salad, just as an FYI. I crave it often and don't hesitate to pop in to order it at the bar for $10."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here for my birthday dinner. While we waited we were given some bread and hummus which was really yummy. I ordered the crab cakes for the starter. It was very good. The crab cakes were very moist inside and the sauce tasted cheesy and complimented it. I ordered the steak frites for main course. It was very yummy. I asked for medium rare but i felt it was a bit too tough to cut through. The fries were very good and thinly cut and the cheese sauce and and salad that came along the side complimented the dish. My friend ordered the atlantic salmon which she enjoyed. I ordered the french 75 cocktail. The waitress said it was the lightest cocktail they had. I felt it was strong yet refreshing because of the lemon flavour. For dessert we ordered the chocolate terrine  It was a flourless chocolate cake. I wasn't a huge fan of it as it tasted too fudgey. Overall my experience at sidecar was great. The place had a romantic feel to it with the candles. Definetly will come back, though not sure if i would order the same dessert. Also i found it a bit strange they served $1 for water."}
{"text":"I liked Sidecar but didn't love it.  The atmosphere is good and so is the food but it just isn't an experience I would rave about.  I've had both the salmon and the risotto and enjoyed both.  The interior is warm and inviting and overall the experience on both occasions was pleasant.  I would happily return but won't be pushing others to try it."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 8. The water they serve you is $1 per person, which mentioned in other reviews is a bit strange. The bread included with the table is decent, and my friends really liked the hummus dip it came with. 4 of us ordered the fries and ribs. I ordered the beef carpaccio as I wasn't as hungry. The food is good and I love the patio seating! Would be a great place for a date."}
{"text":"I would hesitate to give 5 stars to anything, but honestly, the prix fixe is $25 and the sirloin is one of the finest quality steaks I've had for that cut. JYB and I have been here several times in the last few months. We have always got the streak frites and caesar to start, and they have been solid every time. I'm not a big dessert pal, but they do the job too.  If you're lucky, you might even get a seat upstairs at the Toronto Temperance Society (booze club). JYB and I really enjoy this place, good cold ones, good cocktails (servers always happy to answer questions) and an amazing steak on a prix fixe.   You're pretty much the biggest corncob in Toronto or really hate bold flavours if you decided not to go here when given an opportunity."}
{"text":"After consulted YELP, I was super hyped up about going to Sidecar. Alas, I walked out a little disappointed.  Food: - Bread would have been better if they were warm - Poutine with beef and duck gravy was good, but a little salty - Beer and cheddar soup was thicker than usual and again too salty - Steak frites was good. The steak was tender. - Beet risotto was delicious but a little too heavy on the sauce  Service: - Waitress was friendly but the busboy was a not the brightest  Ambiance: - Looked better from the outside than it actually is. The candlelights and all were cute  bu once entered, the noise level was quite high and the tables are so close to one another. I literally could hear the convos of the couples that were sitting 3-4 tables away from us and they werent even that loud (sorry!!) That sucked!!"}
