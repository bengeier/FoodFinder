{"text":"Really great, if you're a lover of SOGO, this beats it hands down. Passed by this place so many times and finally got a chance. My favorite place now."}
{"text":"Super spicy yellow curry is awesome!!!
  Small solid food. Family owned and operated awesome service and friendly."}
{"text":"I had never been there until yesterday. I heard only good things and they were true. The food was so good worth the price because of the taste and the portion you get. Of course I tried the Kannapolis roll because it's located in Kannapolis. It was a great choice I recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just awful.  The underage service people/kids is almost as bad as the food.  Sushi is overpriced and overcooked.  Hate this typical NC Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time nor YOUR money. Food sucks.....scented candles will make you sick.:-(
The server was the worst we had ever had. Never will we be back.:-("}
{"text":"I am always the reader and never the reviewer but today just felt like a special day! Was invited here for a Toastmaster group dinner (check out Toastmasters to help with public speaking) and was so welcomed by Sunshine the owner! We had the Red Dragon Roll, which was fresh and phenomenal, Pad Khee Mao and Sunshine Stir Fry. There is lots more on the menu with a mix of Thai, Laotian and Vietnamese influences. All excellent, next time we will try more rolls! They have been part of the community for a long time and just moved near the fire station off Floyd street. Sunshine is also offering fruit carving classes and has a huge book of her work she is more than happy to show you. What a gem!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at Sunshine's the other day. We shared a plate & definitely had more than enough of our extremely delicious choice. The food is always excellent, fresh, & served beautifully. Sunshine will be sure to please you no matter if you have an issue (which we never have). Please go by her new location-it's very charming- I'm sure it will be a very pleasurable experience for you."}
{"text":"The staffs are friendly.

The Thai tea is good. The portion of the pho is good but the taste is just ok. I like how pho bowl includes different kind of meats (including seafood). The papaya salad, which I believe us Thai style, is also alright. Personally, I like Laos style papaya salad so that can effect why I didn't like the papaya salad as much."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience!!! Jeffery was so friendly and had a lot of recommendations... We loved the spicy tuna roll and the double trouble! We enjoyed draft beers and wine... Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"So decided to try something new with my kids since they all love sushi. Well the presentation was nice sushi was pretty good, however there was a bunch of plastic in our sushi rolls!!! They didn't seem to know what masago was but it clearly stated the roll had this on it. Disappointed!!  The owner just made an excuse but still charged for the sushi. Made us another roll but that too had plastic in it. If that were at my bar any manager I ever had would of comped that!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi with different rolls every week. I've also had the Pad Thai and it's the best around."}
{"text":"Ordered a sesame chicken with fried rice for lunch today. I did not like the way the chicken was cooked or the sauce on it. The rice was not fried like it was supposed to be. There was a mix of side vegetables in the container. Some were steamed and others (lettuce) raw. It was a strange mix. 
I couldn't even finish the meal as I didn't like it. I am getting something else to eat from somewhere else. The reason I gave two stars is because the staff is polite and the order was made quickly. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's just incredible.  Best causality I've had in years.. food came out quick, tasted really good!  And prices are totally affordable. I'd say best Asian food around concord and Kannapolis area."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Do not waste your money here.  We just wanted to try it out so we ordered 3 things.  The salad was nothing but some wilted iceberg lettuce, the sushi did not taste like fresh fish...it had a very strong taste to it.  Also we asked our waiter to remove the dirty dishes 3 times and he ignored us every time.  I have no idea how this place is even in business.  They also have scented candles burning.  No one wants to smell that while eating!!  We could not get out of there fast enough.  If you want some AMAZING Asian cuisine go to ENoodles in Concord!"}
{"text":"The staff here can use some work in grace and being pleasant with customers.

Other than that, the food is AMAZING.  Love it here.  My mother-in-law recommended we try this restaurant for lunch and we've been here a few times since then.

The sushi is great and made right there.

The drink situation could be better but considering it's a small, local restaurant I don't hold it against them."}
{"text":"After a couple meals here with awful service, tried it again last night expecting the same.  They hired a new server and the service was great!  Very happy with our food although we only ordered the basics; the Pad Thai and Teriyaki, both with shrimp.  Can't wait to return.  Hope the owner(s) see this; quality service REALLY makes a difference."}
{"text":"This place is great and also the sushi! It's so fresh and how they decorate there plates are a nice finishing touch."}
{"text":"A fresh take on some traditional Asian dishes that we Americans have come to know love.  And I do mean fresh! My kids love the HIBACHI CHICKEN - it's the lightest and healthiest take on that I've ever seen.  The SESAME CHICKEN isn't drowning in sauce. The PHAD THAI was fantastic and alive with a fresh peanut sauce without being overpowering.

The sushi wasn't bad at all. I had a spicy tuna and a rainbow roll both were good. 

The miso soup was not my favorite. It left a lot of room for taste."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place by accident when we were walking around Cannon Village for the craft fair and wine festival.  We thought about just stopping at one of the food trucks, but decided to go sit down.  Bad idea.  The sushi was rolled so loosely that you could not pick it up with the chop sticks.  The nori used to wrap the sushi was so tough that I had to chew forever and it felt like I'd never get it down.  We also ordered cashew chicken and pad thai with chicken, both of which only had a little chicken sprinkled on top, none actually in dish.  The next day, my friend who ate with me was sick and throwing up the nori.  The food did not all come at the same time, and by the time we got our last roll, we were done and getting ready to leave.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Very affordable, good food. Lots of veggi options, deserts are good and they have a delicious selection of teas. Lots of fun when musicians get together on stage."}
{"text":"Found by accident....best accident I've had in awhile.  Very fresh, tasty, great food.  When back in town, will come back!!"}
{"text":"A great staple to have in the vastly underserved Kannapolis downtown!  We have enjoyed our meals both times we ate here.  Their vegetarian options are good and the sushi always looks tasty!  Family members visiting with special diet needs have struggled slightly - the salads weren't as appetizing looking as we had hoped and one friend with celiac disease had trouble after being assured something was gluten free (spoiler alert - it wasn't).  Overall we enjoy the place and will continue to dine there!"}
{"text":"Im rating the pho - it's fake pho. I've never heard of pho that had peanuts in it. Not a clear broth . Also really sweet . It's very Thai tasting . So if you love authentic pho , you will be disappointed. 
 On another note my husband had pad ke mow and it was good. 
   Summer rolls are ok. 
They nail the Thai flavors not so much the Vietnamese for me."}
{"text":"We have been to Sunshine's many times! We have not been to the new location yet but we look forward to going there soon. Their Thai and other Asian food is fresh, crisp, and delicious. Sunshine, who owns the business, cooks much of the food and she personally ensures that you are taken care of. Their prices and options are great and the value you get is very good. Our family loves their sushi! You must visit the new location at: 930 Floyd St., Kannapolis, NC 28083.

{"text":"No good. Food isn't that great and the service is SO slow at lunchtime. I don't know how this place is still in business honestly..."}
{"text":"This place is very affordable, especially when you take the serving sizes into account. I  a die hard pho lover, and the pho here did not meet my standards sadly. I got the tofu pho and it came with broccoli which I have never seen (though I did appreciate the extra fiber), but the birth was missing that special something. Furthermore they did not serve it with basil (my favorite part!) nor sriracha (maybe because I was sitting outside). After my meal was served, they did not come out once to check on me, sadly. The papaya salad was good. 

It's a great location if you work at NCRC - just a hop and a skip away."}
{"text":"I still like the spring roll and the American Dream roll.The new place looks better and I like their services."}
{"text":"Kannapolis is a culinary wasteland, but I still keep hoping to find little hole in the wall places to love. Sadly this is not going to be one of them. Service was slow and indifferent. I ordered yellow curry, which is my favorite Thai comfort food. The sauce was watery, probably due to the strange addition of broccoli and zucchini, and there were maybe two pieces of meat in the entree portion. It's worth it to drive down to Concord and go to Maithai II instead."}
