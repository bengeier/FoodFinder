{"text":"Excellent food! I took my boyfriend there to treat him.  He is from the south and said there is no other place in our area like this! They know how to cook! The fried chicken and macaroni and cheese were awesome!  Felt great to have real home cooked food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat.  Very friendly owner that prepares all the food when ordered.  do no let the outside appearance make you concerned.  I can say that the Fried Chicken was some of the best I have ever had.  Sweet tea.............just like in the Carolina's.  Baked Beans....our of sight!  Mac & Cheese was so good that I might actually start to like it.  My son states some of the best he has ever had.  We will be back."}

{"text":"This is the best fried chicken hands down! I ate dinner here tonight for my birthday complete with chocolate cake.  I had fried chicken, side of beans (delicious), side of macand cheese (very good), and a bucket of hand cut french fries that were awesome.  The place is small but the waitress was sweet making sweet tea in a carafe and that was perfect with the generous portions of food!  I will be back!  Thanx for a great birthday dinner..."}
{"text":"Went with a Groupon and Cuzins was worth the drive. Fresh food. Delicious!  Small place, simple, but very nice, like sitting in Grandma's large kitchen. Food is cooked to order. Had pulled pork, chicken and waffles for the first time, collard greens, corn bread, mac and cheese, sweet tea just brewed. So good! Chicken is lightly breaded and fried. Grandma's recipes. Princess was a gracious hostess and chef. Carry out was busy, and catering is available.  Plan to wait while the food is cooked. We visited, and watched the news on the TV.  Reservations are not necessary."}
