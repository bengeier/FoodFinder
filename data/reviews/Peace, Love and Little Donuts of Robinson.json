{"text":"We had a groupon for this shop. Our hotel didn't offer b'fast so we thought this would be a fun alternative & it was. I am a tried & true yeast donut girl but these gems won me over. Yes they can be pricey. yes they are indeed small (think donettes). But for a splurge, worth it!  The only topping that was NOT a fave was the maple bacon. How it works is that the donuts are already made. You just choose your toppings & they dip them in front of you...kinda like how subway makes your sandwich in front of you."}
{"text":"This place was near our hotel and the pictures looked great, so we had to check it out. We were impressed with the selection of 50+ flavors on display when you walk in. So much, that we knew we had to get a dozen. All donuts are little cake donuts with endless toppings. They have each option on display and then make each one right in front of you as you choose what you want. Pumpkin cheesecake, cookie dough, cherry pie, samoa, Carmel macchiato and smores are just a few we tried and they were all so good!"}
{"text":"Peace, Love and Little Donuts is always such a treat. They have such a big variety of flavors which is great but always makes it difficult to decide on what to order. This time I went with cookie dough, Samoa, snickerdoodle, coffee cake, coconut and strawberries and cream. The donuts were made fresh while I was waiting to order so my batch came out nice and warm. Each flavor was delicious but I wish I would have ordered more of the holiday flavors. I was told the peppermint hot cocoa is amazing. I will just have to stop back in again soon!"}
{"text":"I've had Peace, Love and Little Donuts before, but have never been inside their store to order them. First of all, the smell of donuts in there just makes you want to eat them all!!! My friend had gifted me a Groupon for $8 off, so I decided to go all out and buy a dozen. Do my boyfriend and I need a dozen of donuts? No. But it was too tempting!!! I got two of each kind that I chose so Mike and I can each try them. The donuts are made as you order them which I thought was super awesome! You know they're fresh! Since I just recently moved down the street, I know I will be back for more soon!!!"}
{"text":"Eww, little tiny overpriced donuts.  Waited way too long to be waited on, the donuts are tiny and not very good.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty bomb donuts. In hindsight, should have bought another dozen before heading back to L.A."}
{"text":"My 1st experience has kept me going back!  Tried the salted caramel with little pretzel sticks, warm and fresh!  Although the donuts are small in size, don't feel as bad about eating a few!  I also like their coffee and other donuts.  My son's fianc√© is having a donut wall at her shower and have ordered from there.  Always friendly and very nice.  I've since taken other people there with me who are now hooked too!  I even got a 6 pack to take to my little grandson in Wyoming.  They survived the trip, he got to taste a few then his dog stole the rest...everyone loves them."}
{"text":"This is the latest location for peace, love and little donuts. While I'm not a fan of the cake donuts I love the variety of flavors. A dozen of the funkadelic (the ones with all the good toppings) is about $15. It is a bit pricey for tiny donuts but they were tasty.   I was a little disappointed they didn't have any with peanut butter. Maybe it's for allergies ?!?"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of donuts, they are freshly made in front of you. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Price per dozen set a very fair price. The donuts are light, tasty and very fresh! If there was any location near Philly I would be there almost everyday. The only disappointment was the shelf life was only 3 day, even in the fridge."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying these little donuts after having freshly fried donuts on vacation in NC. Unfortunately, these were awful. I was first a bit surprised at the very high prices for mini donuts. 
A good donut would've offset that sticker shock. But, what I got were a dozen undercooked dough balls. Done on the outside and raw inside. Even if they had been properly cooked, the \"gourmet\" toppings that drive the prices up the most are basic icings, crumbs and jellies. The concept is cool. The branding is too. The product is bad."}
{"text":"Best find in the Robinson area for Donut lovers!!!!

I got a half dozen of flavors that looked good to me (see picture) and none of them disappointed. The dough is tasty, light, and fresh! The toppings and icing are also awesome. They make the donuts in front of you as you order them, so you know it hasn't been sitting there all day which is great. 

I love the size of the donuts as well. They're not too small and not regular-sized... just perfect for people who want variety since you can eat two different ones without over-indulging. 

Service is good. Place is small but has a cool hippie theme going that's fun. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Oh lordy has this place become an obsession for me. Whenever i am near one of their locations and they are open, I HAVE to stop. It's like a requirement at this point. 

These little pillows of deliciousness are always fresh when when I stop here. So my absolute favorite and one that I grab every time I come is the Razzle Dazzle. So so so good. I recommend it. But I have yet to find a flavor that I do not like. Hot Cocoa, Samoa, S'mores, Maple Bacon and Woodstock are also just a few of my favorites.

The girls are always nice and patient (sometimes you just don't know what you want). They are very helpful too for when you can't decide on a donut. I was also offered a free hot chocolate my last visit and of course I wanted to try it so I accepted since it was absolutely freezing out. It was delicious as well. This location also offers different kinds of coffees and iced coffees."}
