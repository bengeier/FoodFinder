{"text":"food tasted good but their specials are very expensive!! they don't tell you the price and watch for sticker shock when the bill comes! tasted pretty good though."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday Brunch. I am not a fan of egg dishes so I could choose between the pancakes and the potato pancakes. I had the potato pancakes.  They were not very flavourful, but they are potato. It came with sour cream and some apple sauce/chutney. It also came with sausage and bacon. The meal was good. My husband had the smoked salmon omelet which came with salad and potatoes. It was also good. My husband's complaint was that the service was off. Tables had been moved to accommodate larger groups and he had to wait for a chair.  It took a while to get our food but it was up fast once the order was in. Our server failed to mention the specials and that also irked my hubby. I haven't been here for any other meal, but brunch was fast and tasty."}

{"text":"Vi Pei is that hidden gem in Cliffside! There's a couple of promising eateries in this little stretch of shops, and having just moved into the nearby neighborhoods, I'm exploring them one by one. Vi Pei is in a class by itself! It's a great little bistro with friendly service and great dining for very reasonable prices. Normally I'm not a huge fan of pasta-heavy menus - I can make great pasta at home. But we had an excellent seafood pasta here that was worth ordering - heavy on the scallops and completely delicious. I had ribs and grilled veggies that were beautifully done. They even have a reduced price dinner on Mondays! I would give it five stars if not for the location - the open front wall looks out on a grungy parking lot, which does take away from the atmosphere somewhat... but takes nothing away from the meal! We will be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"I like to keep things simple:  -Good atmosphere, a little cozy but still pleasant -Good service -Good food  A nice place to go in the east end"}
{"text":"We have heard such great things about this place (even from local businesses), so we had to give it a try.  We went there for brunch, and their selection, taste, and presentation were great!  The restaurant is on the smaller side, but it was fine for brunch.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Vi Pei dozens of times over the years for breakfast and it never disappoints.  They know how to make poached eggs and their Grand Marnier French Toast is amazing.  Huge portions that even my teenage son is full when we go.  Great fresh food and good value."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times for dinner (See my previous review) but this was the first time for brunch. I have to say that it truly lives up to the quality they provide for dinner. I ordered the potato pancake which comes with apple cheddar chutney(ish) stuff over top - to understand this explaintion see the picture; bacon AND sausage, sour cream (for dipping duh!) and fresh fruit. OH my goddddddd was it unbelieveable. This was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, I love the fact that you don't need to choose between bacon and sausage, who doesn't love breakfast meats? Vi Pei understands the need for both. The pancakes were delicious just the right amount of potato/onion flavour and perfect texture. Now to the best part, stuffing yourself to the brim for just $8. Yes that's right $8. Next time you want a hearty and upscale breakfast that won't hurt your pocket, go to Vi Pei."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food...will definitely be back! All five people I dined with were very happy with their experience. I had the potato pancakes for brunch, and while they could have used more seasoning, the meal itself was great. The apples they served on the side were lovely.... Not too sugary, just the right level of sweetness."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE . Our server, although very polite was unprepared. When asked about the specials she said she would check. Came back a couple minutes later and asked if we are ready to order.  I ordered the specials anyway. My drink ran empty and our food took almost a hour to arrive. The seafood pasta had pieces of shrimp shells and fish bones. We mention to our server. She said she would try and do something to compensate. After we got the bill not only was there no compensation, we found out that the price for the special was much higher than their menu items. I tried calling later on that night and the next day to speak to the manager. Left messages no response. What a rip off. Some special! Over priced and took forever."}
{"text":"We once went a hunt for the best eggs benedict on the east side. Our journey took us to leslieville and beyond. And hands down this place has the greatest eggs benny we have ever had and at $8 it's a steal of a deal."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. I had the classic eggs Benedict which was very good. The hollandaise could have used a little more flavour but other than that no complaints. My husband got the eggs Benedict nova and my mother got the big breakfast. They both thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely will return again."}
{"text":"Bought the one of the benne specials. I can't remember the name which speaks to how unforgettable the dish was. The shrimps, crab cake, sitting on a potato hash and eggs benne with hollandaise sauce was all pretty bland. For $16 I expected a party in my mouth. This was not. Redeeming qualities was the mango salad dressing on the salad and the ripe fruits on the side which you can get on any otheir other dishes. I would not get this dish again.  Not giving up on this place though. Will come back and try their other dishes and hoping for the best!"}
{"text":"The menu is very similar to it's sister's, Vi Vetha on Queen St. E., where I've never had a bad meal.  This visit didn't disappoint.  My Wild Mushroom Sandwich, my wife's Grilled Wild Mushroom Salad and cousin's 3-Cheese omelet were all excellent.  Nice sides of fruit, salad and fries.  Mmmm, great fries.  A Cliffside neighbourhood gem!  Bonus...I got to show my cousin the Scarborough Bluffs for her first time!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific. We have eaten here many times as it's walking distance for us. I have never been disappointed. Breakfast (and sometimes other meals as well) is always served with beautiful fresh fruit. The meats are done to perfection. Service is always prompt and friendly. Prices are extremely reasonable. A local Gem."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I've been here for dinner and brunch several times and have never been disappointed. Their brunch menu has all the classics and they make a delicious Eggs Benny.  For dinner there is an extensive pasta menu. My most recent trip was with a group of 5, 4 of whom ordered various pasta dishes, with every person eating every last morsel on their plate. The last individual had ribs, which were fall off the bone and tender.  They usually have a lot of \"specials\". The servers always recites them dutifully once you're seated. Specials seem to be priced about $5-$10 more then regular menu items.  The prices here are very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. Im really happy to have found this place in a random strip mall on Kingston Rd."}
{"text":"Luv this place for any occasion.  Great anytime of the day. Great service and staff. Super clean.  Def. A repeat client!"}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast anyone? I don't get out in Scarborough too often, so we decided to try Vi Pei. Judging by the name, I wasn't really sure what to expect. Parking is a little funky here, so if you're parking out front, I recommend backing in.   We were greeted warmly and seated. Their coffee is pretty good...may be because I just woke up, but either way, I had 2 cups. My mom got the Ham, Cheese and Spinach Eggs Benedict with homefries and salad. I got the Brie Stuffed Brioche French Toast. She thinks it's weird to get salad with eggs, but that's how brunch rolls! Both dishes were huge! The hollandaise sauce is nice and creamy and they don't hold back on the veggies. My French toast was fantastic. The sweetness of the French toast went perfectly with the smooth brie. The fruit was very fresh. Good portions!   On yet another Sunday Breakfast, My mom had the Seafood Omelette and I had good ol' Eggs Benedict. The omelette had a little bit of everything in it. My eggs benny was as expected, cooked to order and awesome. Good salad and homefries; can't go wrong!   Service was good on both visits; a cheerful bunch. This place gets packed from breakfast right to lunch. I haven't been for dinner, but I'm hoping to! Glad it's close to home!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite go to places in Scarborough.  Especially great for brunch if you like Eggs Benedict.   Very good service.  This place is tiny inside, so often times you have to line up to get a seat, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the best French toast we've ever had.  Candied pecans, fresh fruit, caramel, real maple syrup with mascarpone cheese, its so decadent.  The breakfast in general here is amazing and is the only reason we come here.  The apple salad dressing they have is a must.  The atmosphere is nice and service is really good, the only reason I can't give it a five is because their sangwiches are actually terrible.  Chewy steak with odd seasoning, and the veal and chicken sangwich are equally overcooked messes.  Stick to the breakfast or pasta and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"We've been here for breakfast only a few times now, and we will be coming back.  The location is pretty convenient, right on Kingston Road, with enough parking out front. Service is very knowledgeable and friendly, and food comes reasonably quickly, all good things.  As I said before, we've only been here for breakfast, so that is all i will comment on. They have great pancakes - light, fluffy with killer toppings. The potato pancakes are rich and flavourful, the scrambles are really tasty, too. In fact, that is the theme of this place - flavour. There is nothing boring or plain here. Each dish is made and accented to enhance the flavours so your tongue is never bored.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of some small things. The potatoes are cooked well but not fried enough, they use way too much coarse ground pepper, and the tea could be better. But these are small things, and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"...i just totally fell in love with this place! it is literally a diamond in the rough and worth every bit of the trek out to cliff side area for their brunch. i'm definitely going to turn into a regular here in no time flat. the decor is beautiful, modern yet classy. small and quaint, you will be pleasantly surprised given the area it's in.   we ordered: brunch combo platter, excellent, french toast was to die for.  beach scrambler, excellent, made with REAL corned beef, not from a can!  our waitress was friendly and attentive, our experience was outstanding. and with such fair prices, they earned every single bit of my 5star rating :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised and how nice the restaurant is. The food was excellent and the price was very reasonable.   I'm looking to check out dinner on night."}
{"text":"Fabulous place. My cousin Ellen brought us here and I had a fancy eggs benedict with lox. It was fu*king bomb and was delicious. Everyone in our group was happy with their meals. Vi Pei is lovely for a date and you can go check out the bluffs right after a romantic brunch."}
{"text":"Another AMAZING meal at Vei Pei in Scarborough! Had tri-colour cheese tortellini with pesto cream sauce, wild mushrooms, bacon, sun-dried tomaroes and spinach. I couldn't finish it all but wanted to. A great snack for later. My friend had the teriaki salmon with delicious seasonal grilled vegetables in sauce. Air-conditoned, music at a prefect volume, our server was delightful and she couldn't have been more courteous and.professional. A fantastic top off to Canada Day 2018. Will definitely be back! Price point is right where it should be. (Oh and the washroom was very clean.)  Don't let the small size of this eatery fool you."}
{"text":"I have been to the other locations and this site was just as good.  Menu was varied enough for our party and food was delicious and service great.  Area seems a bit seedy but restaurant although small is quite comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast/lunch. Food is fresh and so tasty. Both locations are fantastic. Have not been for dinner but neighbourhood friends have advised that dinner too is amazing. Definitely recommend. Food is worth the price for sure. Service is also very good. If you have special requests they do it exactly as you want as well. Can't say enough....this bistro is a must try! I've written the same review for the other location."}

{"text":"I wish I had not waited so long to eat here. Since the closing of Joey Bravo's there has not been a decent place to eat pasta near me. This place rocks. They were easy with my habit of mixing up pasta menus and asking for subs which an awful lot of places balk at. Bravo Vi Pei. Your pasta was impeccable. Can't wait to return for your eggs Bennie"}
{"text":"This restaurant is as great quality and flavour as you would find in downtown Toronto. Very interesting food, generous portions and ingredients, for example the Seafood Lovers Linguini has a very generous amount of seafood! Friendly service, a no problem/of course attitude rarely found in Toronto anymore."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch on several occasions, the soup du jour is always good but I love soup. This place is gluten free; the majority of the menu is a good healthy choice.   The atmosphere is friendly and has a home feel which gives it an authentic Greek taste. I definitely recommend this place.   #30daysofYelp"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, as it is close by, I was very impressed with the food selection for such a little place, and the house wine was a great choice.  I had the pasta with spicy Italian sausage, the asparagus soup, the coffee as I always like to try to coffee - it was from a coffee maker but it did the trick.   The dining room is small but has a cozy feel; the food is served in a timely manner and made to order for most things."}
{"text":"I went here only after reading a review from yelp, and thanks for the tip, we enjoyed another breakfast place in Toronto. We tried their breakfast menu but true, you can order something other than eggs and sausage, there's pasta and sandwiches too.  Their Eggs Benedict looks perfect, will try that one next time. We went Satruday brunch time and the place is filled with happy chattering people. Nice way to start my Saturday."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place! The waitresses were very pleasant. My first glance at the menu got me, for sure! There aren't many places that have multiple kinds of mushrooms, and this place had the widest selection I've seen in years. I had their veal and asiago sandwich and it was to die for. It was such a treat. My mum had the spinach gorgonzola sandwich and it was delicious as well. Their house dressing on their salad was very tasty, even their french fries were crisp to perfection. They give you a few slices of fresh fruit on your place for desert as well.  Definitely coming back here again. Some of the best food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my brunch at this place! I've never heard of this restaurant but a friend of my fiancé recommended it and we really liked it!  The portions of their brunch were so filling! The crispy potatoes stood out to me, it was super crispy and it seems like they used different spices to UP the flavour VS your typical salt and pepper. I also love that they fried it with red peppers and red onions, the onions give it a sweet caramel side while the red peppers give it a sweet bitter dimension.   My eggs benny were perfect! Just the way I like it with spinach and mushroom and the hollandaise sauce was so creamy and good!   I would definitely come back! The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Came here on a friend's suggestion and enjoyed a great meal. I ordered the eggs portobello and my fiancé had the eggs ViPei. They were both eggs benedict dishes however instead of peameal bacon being used, my dish had poached eggs over portobello mushrooms, baby spinach and sausage while my fiancé had a similar dish but with sautéed spinach and mixed mushrooms. The home fries that the dishes came with were nice and crispy and there was also some lightly dressed greens and fruit.   Our server was very attentive and made sure our water and coffee were always filled. The food came out very quickly and we enjoyed a nice meal to start our day. We don't travel to the east end too often but we would definitely come back the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to Vi Pei with family, which isn't very large (2-4 people, max), so I apologize if my experience sounds biased due to having so few people. I've seen groups as big as 10 dining in, but I can't be sure how many more they'd fit - it's a beautiful hole-in-the-wall along Kingston Road!  I've probably only came here a maximum of 10 times, but every single time has been a unique and amazing experience. I've had a variety of dishes - mostly between brunch and lunch dishes, although I've been here for dinner & dessert at least twice. I'm a big fan of value-to-fullness ratio, and Vi Pei delivers solidly on that, as well as the presentation of the food & the service as well as professionalism of the staff.  Brunch selection is amazing, in both the senses of variety and quality. I've had the pancakes. I've had the French Toast. I learned about Poached Eggs for the first time, and learned about the differences in hardness of poached eggs. After eating the hard poached eggs here, I can't imagine eating eggs any other way - when I scramble my own eggs at home I long for these ones instead!  Lunch selection is quite good too. I don't exactly remember specifics (I come here mostly for brunch, if you can tell by the above paragraph), but the lunch items I ordered were quite filling, and I remember tipping a handsome amount because of how quickly the food was served (will update review when I go again).  Dinner selection was interesting. There are at least three pages of pasta, and one page dedicated to items that, well, aren't pasta. The pasta selections are high in quality and expansive in selection/variety. The non-pasta options are fewer (obviously), but still high in quality (I've had the steak before - it was quite good, albeit a little overcooked - I usually get medium rare, but I received it medium well, YMMV!).  Before I move on to the \"final course\", I want to mention that these guys have impeccable presentation; the vegetables are really great, in both the look and taste! They give you some fruits instead of veggies if you go for Breakfast/Brunch, and these are always well designed and great tasting -- not to mention filling. Easily the best value for my money, since I've begun a bit of a health kick recently.  Dessert - where do I begin. I've had the tartufo before; it's probably one of the greatest desserts I've ever eaten - I would definitely recommend it. Great presentation, great taste, and great value for my money. Their other desserts are amazing too - there's a dish that has three slices of different kinds of pie for $15 - great for sampling or if you just want every kind of pie they have! Individually the dessert dishes (food-wise) are $6.50 each, on average.  One reason I give it a 4.5-star instead of a 5 is because it's TINY. We're talking two rows of tables all the way to the back, and that's it. If it was able to accommodate more people, I'd probably be all-in regardless, but I really like the fact that it's so intimate and small. I've rounded up for posterity's sake - they deserve it in any case.  Another major reason is the cost of the food. Sure, it's great for the price range, but there's no \"tiny\" option or \"mix-and-match\" - it's massive portion sizes for a fair (but high, since it's a massive portion) price. If I was able to ask for a bigger dish and remove items with some savings, it'd easily be 5/5 all day every day.  TL;DR: Great place to be for brunch/lunch; dinner menu is lacking outside of pasta (they're great for pasta, though!); dessert menu is a \"must-try\", even if you only like the cafe lattes or other dessert-like drinks.  I'll definitely be going in the near future, so expect pictures of my food to come soon! I've only recently started uploading (let alone snapping) pictures of the places I review, so keep an eye out!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it is by far the best breakfast place in the City....and lord knows I have tried so many!!  I have had most of the breakfast dishes on the menu, I especially love the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  The food, the service and the ambiance are perfect.  The prices are VERY reasonable for the quality ingredients and the obviously high-end chef that turns out perfect meals each time.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high end breakfast place at Scarborough prices."}
{"text":"My family mostly lives in the east end, and to find a place that is not a chain is a pain! I'll admit it; I hate going to the burbs. But I love my family, so I have to try to make everyone happy. I know that there are many wonderful food establishments in the East end, but come on Yelp! Tell me where they are! I was trying to find a brunch place in Scarborough, and it was like pulling teeth!! When I found Vi Pei, I did a happy dance. Finally!   When we arrived for brunch this morning (Sunday morning around noon), there was a line. But the staff was efficient and found us a booth for 4 pretty quickly (about 10 minutes). I know that I am spoiled when it comes to food here in Toronto. The number of brunch options in the TDot is insane! So when my family OHHHHD and AHHHD over their eggs and French toast. What can I say? Cutest thing EVER!   The food was okay. Not great. But just the fact that it made my family happy; it won me over. I did not end up eating much as I had to give my potatoes to my cuz (they were swimming in onions---I HATE ONIONS!). So I was pretty hungry several hours later. Usually when I eat brunch, I am stuffed! Not this time. But the prices are very reasonable, the service was friendly and efficient, and now my family and I have a place to call our own for future brunch dates (as long as they pick-me-up from a subway station. Hell if I am making the WHOLE trek by TTC!)."}
{"text":"Been probably about 10 times (once or twice a month)  Great place for brunch. It is my go to place and the servers are very friendly. Seating can sometimes be difficult as it gets really busy.  Food during Brunch/Lunch is 5/5. Dinner 3.5/5. I love their fries (crispy), salad and fruits (always fresh).  Price: 4.5/5 - Great value but their specials can be a bit pricey  Service: 5/5 - Never had issue and they are always friendly.  Overall: Highly recommended for brunch but I find their dinner menu (specifically the pasta) to be underwhelming."}
{"text":"An amazing breakfast/brunch spot. Menu selection is plentiful. There's a wide variety of items to choose from and there's always daily specials. The food portions are huge and does not disappoint. The ingredients are fresh and the pairing of flavours are right on target - hats off to the chefs."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have breakfast at 11 am on a Tuesday. We were very pleasantly surprised by Vi Pei. Portions are very great, presentation and atmosphere were nice, prices are reasonable, food was very good and service was friendly and quick. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place can sometimes have good dishes, but lately I've received the worst food and service possible in this industry. Got a creme brûlée, where the creme had separated and the brulee was only sugar (not melted, but grains). When we asked them why that was the case, they said they didn't have the torch that day. Why serve it? One day I placed a large order and was asked to pick it up in 40 minutes. Went 40 minutes later to find out that the server forgot to put the order through, so I had to wait a long time and was late to my own party. The worst was this morning. We got toast slices that had fully turned green and moldy!!!! How could they toast that bread and not see that? Again, only a mild apology from the server who said, \"we should probably replace that\". A couple of times the food has been very inconsistent too. Very sad that they are getting away with this rubbish because of very few restaurants in this stretch."}
