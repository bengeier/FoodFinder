{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience at Mangoes. I ordered a large jerk chicken dinner and a large fry chicken dinner. Both came with a good portion of chicken, ample rice n' peas and nothing else. Each dinner was $10 plus tax. I was asked after each was packed if I wanted salad. Not slaw, but rather a garden salad which I assume would have been complimentary. I declined so she included two small festivals.   The service was perfectly friendly.   The food was average. I am a huge fan of Caribbean food and have eaten at 10s and 10s of Caribbean establishments. I feel comfortable with saying that this was safe jerk. That is, just enough heat to notice but not nearly enough to bead a sweat, (which is how I like it). The gravy seemed common, perhaps it was instant.  The fry chicken was ok, but again, smack dab mediocre. Lastly, alas, there was no scotch bonnet sauce. Only a bottle of Grace Red Hot sauce was available.   I'll be back on a Friday for some jerk pork, (the only day of the week it's served), and I'll update my review then."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the portion size is horrendous. Paying for a large dinner and getting something that is half packed of food (definitely a medium or just smaller) and still feeling hungry in the end isn't worth the money.   Would have loved a decent caribbean near mimico but don't feel like being short changed."}
