{"text":"This is the best place for bbq. Love the brisket and pulled pork. Also the best greens in town"}
{"text":"Great barbecue, fresh sides, nice people, good service!
Not fancy but well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! The brisket is out of this world and I love Sarah's mild sauce. Nothing like some good barbecue, we can take our grandkids they have a great kids menu and on the weekends they stay open late. The owners are fantastic I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Above average to very good Bbq.   I can tell, from experience, that they put time and effort into making great Bbq.  Signs everywhere educate the customer on real Bbq.  Many sauces, my favorite was the hot version of Sweet and sassy.   It  net very well with my pulled sliders.  I tried all three meats.  The chicken was white (unexpected) and was not dry.   The pulled pork was also moist and tender.  Nice smoke rings and appearance on all meats.  All the service is plated on steel trays and with minimal extras.   I'll be back and try some other platters.   Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!  Had the BBQ half rack of ribs, potato salad and Mac n cheese (they accidentally brought me onion straws as well). All wonderful! 

Vinnie's sauce is more vinegar based and Sarah's is mor sweet. Like them both. They're also good mixed together.

The potato salad was legit. The ribs were just awesome and fell off the bone. The Mac n cheese was good and a little peppery. 

My only issue was that they didn't have the collard greens when we were there so there were no veggies on the menu for us. Would have loved the greens...oh well. Everything we did have was great!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars solely for their meats.  Do yourself a favor and get the brisket.  It's awesome - juicy and flavorful with a pepper crust!  I'd go back just for that.

I got the slider sampler (because I wanted to try all of the meats) and it was very good!  They offer 2 different sauces, but really I felt only the chicken needed it.  

However, the sides fell quite short.  We had the baked beans and mac and cheese.  We were not fans.  

It's a small little restaurant and definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town, and some of my favorite I've ever tried."}
{"text":"As amazing as I remember the original ribs in Hanover. So glad we stumbled upon this new location."}
{"text":"World class smoked meat and sandwich craftsmanship in the most unexpected location. They have the butter crunch of the bun down to a science. Great atmosphere. Great food. Great price."}
