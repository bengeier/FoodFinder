{"text":"Their donuts are pretty good. But there seems to ve no seating the times that I have been there. And the wait is a bit much."}
{"text":"Great Food...Great Service...Great Atmosphere...Great People. \"Rise\" to the occasion and visit, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today (20 minute drive) after placing an online order. Was disappointed to arrive back home 20 mins later to discover I received the wrong sandwich. What a disappointment, if I return again I will definitely be checking my bag before I leave the store."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this much anticipated donut shop in Steele creek. The donuts are ok nothing spectacular and if they aren't fresh they are hard. The breakfast sandwiches though omg read carefully. Everything you add is an extra cost. I repeat an extra cost. It adds up rather fast. It was ok but they don't honor discounts at all locations so call before to check. They had advertised on their Facebook page about a teacher discount at the beginning of the year but when I got there they did not honor the discount. Bummer!"}
{"text":"I've been twice since they opened and have tried various donuts and all were amazing. Have yet to try a biscuit but if they are anything like the donuts I'm sure I'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Like others have said, good donuts, ok biscuits.  They do manage to move a line pretty well, be prepared for at least one of your choice of donuts to be out. Donuts we had were very good."}
{"text":"Sorry to say neither myself or my 8yr old liked the Fruity Pebbles or Oreo donuts. I will give them another chance and pray for a better experience but will stay away from those two items."}
{"text":"Staff were super friendly this morning. It was my first time visiting and I had a great experience. The sandwiches/biscuits are amazing. The donuts are really good too coffee was on point. Definitely worth checking this place out. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Rise - you did not disappoint. The chicken sandwich is unreal good. My wife got it with pimento and a fried egg and raved about it! The prices are kind of pricey, especially when you add cheese or other toppings. Mine was $6 and my wife's was $10. All in all, we will be going back, regularly."}
{"text":"My husband and I waited in line this morning to try our new Bakery. The line moved fairly quickly and we had all of our donuts picked out before we got to the register. The older woman working the register (Sunday morning) was extremely rude. (I figured in a brand new establishment we would be greeted with a smile and a little bit of excitement.)  one of the donuts I ordered was a \"maple bacon\" and the cashier responded with a rude \"we're out\". I asked what the tray in front of the \"MAPLE DONUTS\" sign was and she condescendingly said, \"that's salted Carmel\" (as if I should have know this).  She didn't say \"thank you\" or anything to us after that.  Just handed me my receipt and looked over my shoulder to greet the next customer.    Really disappointed and hope that employee can put a smile on her face for the other PAYING customers Rise will have."}
{"text":"Nice place for morning breakfast. Offers donuts, biscuits, sandwiches and variety of drinks. Nice for families, friends and has outside seating."}
{"text":"Biscuits were hot and flaky as advertised and even though there was a long line of people waiting and unsure of what they wanted the staff expertly asked questions and made suggestions and kept the line moving."}
{"text":"This mornings event really put a sour taste in my mouth about Rise's customer service.  Will we be back?  Sure, but I won't be jumping to go anymore.  We are still trying the menu and making sure we aren't missing out on anything fantastic.  Ordered donuts, sandwich, and biscuits and gravy.    When we ordered we should have been told the gravy is not ready it will be 30-40 minutes.  Instead we waited and waited.  We were told they were working on the gravy, but had we known it was going to take so long, we would have ordered something else or just done away with it.  It really should have been comped for us anyways as to wait 30-40 minutes for luke warm so-so gravy was quite an annoyance.  A note to Rise, if you don't have something and it is going to be awhile, let us know so we can weigh our options, sure we want to wait or no, I'd like a sandwich instead.  Not too happy after this experience!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends on a Sunday morning. They have great biscuits and donuts. The donuts are light and fluffy. There is not a bunch of space inside, but plenty of seating outside. Good quick breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great biscuits and donuts!! Maybe a little too good! Great variety and they always have new flavors. They can be very busy so you have to get there early before they run out"}
{"text":"Good hot fresh biscuits. Buttered means grilled on griddle, the jelly is Smuckers packets.  Cuban biscuit is excellent and generous with meat portions.  Country ham biscuit is awesome.  Pricey, but really good.  Milk is really expensive.  Donuts are big and seem over the top, they were okay, but that is a preference thing and folks were buying them up.  Cute place that could use a drive thru."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on yelp and saw the pictures and had to go! Went on a Sunday around 10:15ish and oh my there was a very long line so we went did our shopping came back around 10:50 and line was better. Very fast service and interesting doughnuts. We got a bacon biscuit and added egg and avocado spread and a sausage patty biscuit and added egg and avocado spread and got 4 doughnuts. Was about 20 bucks for everything. Food came out and the biscuits were HUGE. Nice fresh biscuit and they weren't dry. For doughnuts we got 2 creme brulee, cheer wine, and a Oreo doughnut. Cheer wine was okay didn't really taste like cheer wine. Oreo doughnut had big chunks of Oreos on it with the white frosting below the Oreo crumbs and it was delicious. Creme brulee very good as well. It is a creme filled doughnut. I didn't get this doughnut but there's a maple bacon doughnut and they have a huge piece of bacon on it. Lots of patio seating outside so if you come on a nice day you should sit outside enjoy the nice scenery. Will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I visited Rise for the first time on a whim. When arriving I was greeted by a very friendly staff member. I decided to try a simple item, the original with cheese and pickle. Since it was my first time visiting, the staff provided a few recommendations and also allowed me to taste the hashpuppies to help me decide. I wanted something light, so I passed on the hashpuppies. But, they were quite good, a mix of potatoes, cheese, sour cream and chives in one bite.   As a first time patron, he offered a complimentary donut...a nice touch for building patronage. I took my order to go.   I was underwhelmed with the sandwich. The biscuit was fluffy and buttery; however, the chicken breast was not crispy with soft breading. This is different than the advertised crispy chicken breast. Unfortunately, one of my greatest food pet peeves is soggy breading for what is intended to be crispy.  The cake donut was awesome. I would recommend those and the original donut. Overall, the customer services as superb but the food left a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to rise and I totally made a rookie mistake!   I went when they were pretty much out of everything for the day. Ugh.   Anyhoo...I opted to sample what was left and got a sprinkle donut with vanilla icing.   Don't get me wrong it was good...but it would be better if it was a little fresher.   I'm looking forward to giving them another try and perhaps even sampling some of their other breakfast options."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Rise Biscuits Donuts! It was amazing, the food was delicious. Service was great, they even threw in TWO donuts for my boyfriend on the HOUSE, for it being our first time visiting! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is the second location I've tried. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I splurged on my carbs fo sho! I got a biscuit with egg white, white cheddar and tomato. Something about that white cheddar...it's perfect. The cool tomato on the hot egg. The biscuits are just -right-salty/fluffy/buttery.       Now, the donuts: I was hoping for the carrot cake because it's worth having it overnighted to a boyfriend to show him you're in love( with the donut). However I'm kinda an apple fritter guru and there's is now my second favorite. The lemon old fashioned was a bit dry, but it was not left uneaten."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was my first time at any Rise establishment so I went in with an open mind. I ordered a biscuit with ham, egg and cheese with avocado spread and a few donuts. The service was fast and pleasant, I received my biscuit sandwich and as I walked out I was handed another sandwich. I informed the employee that I only ordered one sandwich, she then told me I was charged for two sandwiches. I took my order and sat at an outside table and opened my order. The same employee came outside and if I had eaten the other biscuit sandwich, I replied, \"no\". She said that it was someone else's order, took the bag and handed it to another customer. That didn't bother me because I apparently didn't pay for two sandwiches but the thing that made me scratch my head was the fact she just took the sandwich and handed off to someone else. What should've happened was a new biscuit should have been made and given to the other customer. What if I wasn't an honest person, and I did take a bite out of the sandwich or something worse?  Secondly, the food was surprisingly greasy. The egg was as slippery as ever and covered in grease. The ham in the sandwich was so salty it was impossible to eat, the taste resembled salt water. I ate some parts of the biscuit and it was nice tasting but overall the sandwich was less than satisfactory, especially for the price. The donuts made up for the biscuit sandwich, the apple fritter was delicious. Would I go back? Maybe for donuts."}
{"text":"It was just ok. To be honest, the slightly larger biscuit was just as good as Bojangles. If BoJ, every decided to offer  different toppings, then Rise will be in trouble.  Customer service was very personable. The donuts appeared not as fresh as expected. Looked like they may have been trucked in? They tasted better than they looked. Liked that they were not overly sweet;  I would consider coming back, but only if I am already in the area. I failed to see the hype."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I've never had a bad biscuit or donut from you guys!! Keep up the great work! Give us a location in Greenville SC so I can never go without you"}
{"text":"Love this place. The biscuits are great and the doughnuts are good especially the strawberry buttercream but the 2 I want to try they always sell out is the maple bacon bar and the cheerwine doughnut. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, although it's new so I'd expect this.  Food options not very healthy although tasted pretty good.  Little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"It sure is a great place to have some donuts...oh wait, they don't have any! I came here in the morning and in the afternoon twice, and they didn't have any donuts present in the glass. I asked the lady and she said that \"they didn't have them ready\" or \"sorry we don't make anymore at this time.\" I lost my interest in this new fad of Rivergate. I stopped going because I knew that I would only be disappointed. Not a lot of people are going too. My parents and I all lost interest when they decided that, \"Hey! Let's open a donut shop and not have any donuts!\" Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Order one egg and bacon biscuit, one chocolate glazed donut, one sour cream donut, one small milk.  What bothered me most was the markup on the small milk to pay $1.75 was a bit ridiculous. There were several employees most of whom were talking to each other so to sit down at a dirty counter was annoying. The restroom was unkept and unclean and the floors throughout had not been swept which surprised me since it was only 7:30 in the morning. Overpriced for the quality of product."}
{"text":"So much excitement when we saw the signs for something new in Rivergate.   But after four visits now, we are left with little more than disappointment and confusion.   At first we thought, okay, they're new. This would explain being out of everything by 10am and the sandwiches being cold. The second time we laughed it off and thought our luck was bad.   The third time we had waited long enough for a new staff to be trained.   This morning we were feeling the holiday spirit and thought we'd try again.   Here's what we have come to understand about Rise:  * Do not enter the building having a taste for what is on their limited menu, your first disappointment will present itself when you realize they don't have any more today. (And why make more when they are only open until 2pm and it's already 9am)  * Do not expect your food to be hot. (Or Luke warm for that matter)  * While some establishments work their tales off almost twenty hours a day to keep their doors open in this competitive industry, Rise has managed to open their doors at 7am, be out of half their menu by 9am, disappoint patrons until roughly 2pm and then kick their shoes off and enjoy the rest of their day.   * Apparently their award winning schedule hasn't warmed the hearts of their staff and crew. Most visits include an explanation of how short staffed they are and the donut maker walked off the job this morning.   * The concept of Rise is simple. Simple menu, simple hours of service, simple breakfast. Not sure how it became so difficult for them to keep it together. I mean even on a bad day they have what no other restaurant has...17 hours to regroup and get it right...before opening their doors again."}
{"text":"The food Is pretty good, but way more pricy than it needs to be.  If you're charging more than someone can buy a carton of eggs for, just to put one egg on a biscuit?  As a 'premium item'? No thanks."}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive breakfast spot, our bill totaled like $13 (we didn't get drinks). While on a quick vacation in Charlotte this week, my boyfriend and I ate a Rise. I ordered the \"righteous chicken\" biscuit with white cheddar cheese and he ordered the \"bacon, fried egg, and cheese\" biscuit. We both agreed both were delicious and very filling, might I add. The chicken was well seasoned, hot and just all around good. I'm very particular about my biscuits, but there's were that perfect balance of soft, not oily and firm.My boyfriend devoured his food in minutes. The only thing keeping this place from a 5/5 is the hashpuppies (paid almost an extra $2 for them too), wasn't crazy about them. I expected cheese melted on top of tater tots, however the cheese was the filling inside the tater tots instead. Next time, I'll try a donut, but we came an hour to close and their selection was extremely limited. Definitely go and enjoy a quality, inexpensive breakfast/lunch option."}
{"text":"Oh m gee! I ordered the pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes biscuit and it was big and good!!! There was a line but it moved quickly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch today FINALLY.. I figured I'll give it sometimes so the hype dies down.. But at 11:15am, its busy as ever.   Customer Service: 4/5 Helped us at the counter but wasn't much to it after that.. But consistent   Cleanliness of the place: 3/5 I see all the staffs are busy behind the counter either assisting with making food or taking orders. Bar/Counter (seating area) are left semi-dirty. Haven't been wipe. Floor needs a follow-up sweep. That's why we took our orders and ate outside instead.   Food: 4/5 I ordered the Fried Chicken Biscuit with avocado spread with mayo.. I'm not crazy about the biscuit or something is off. I taste a hint of sourness to it. I just can't figure it out. However, I love the fried chicken tho.  I had a taste of  the ham biscuit and it's pretty good. I also tried the PB & Jelly donut. I'm crazy not about. Not enough jelly and can't taste the peanut butter except the nuts topping.   I would like to try other things on the menu. Like the chicken salad sandwich or some of the classic donuts. Will update accordingly!"}
{"text":"OMG. I love Rise. It's about the closest thing I can get to my Grandma's biscuits. My favorite is country ham. The doughnuts are also awesome but I usually stick with the biscuits."}
{"text":"First morning in Charlotte and I stopped here for my first meal. What a great way to start. Rise is a dual shop, they do biscuits and they do doughnuts, or 'donuts' as they spell it. This is a small chain that stretches from Durham to Charlotte with about 8 or 9 units.   We arrived here about 11:30am beating the lunch rush. As this was my first visit I took a quick look at the donut case and then the menu board and decided. I selected the Pickled Jalapeno Meatloaf Biscuit which also comes dressed with chipotle ketchup and crispy fried onions. For a side I also added a Hashcake and a can of Coca-Cola for the drink  After a short wait our names were called and we received our breakfast. It was a nice morning and we decided to eat outside at one of the tables on the side of the building. My biscuit was beautiful. It was golden in color and the bread was light and fluffy. The meatloaf was delicious and the pickled jalapeno left a lingering hint of heat without overwhelming. Delicious. The Hashcake was just ok. Basically like a hashbrown like you would get from any fast food joint but with some cheddar cheese in it. For $2.50... I could have picked up two hashbrowns anywhere else for that price and they would have been cooked all the way through. This side dish needs some work and in my opinion a bit of a price drop for what you're getting.   All in all a pleasant experience. I really enjoyed the Pickled Jalapeno Meatloaf Biscuit. The Hashcake wasn't terrible, it was just wasn't fully cooked and really wasn't worth the price. I found the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they answered all of our questions without hesitation. I'll definitely be back on my next visit to Charlotte"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite sandwich/donut shop. They have so many donuts to choose from and they always rotate new ones in! The workers are very friendly. The bacon, egg and cheese on a biscuit is my go to. Don't forget to get the hushpuppies with a side of \"comeback sauce\" you will thank me later ! (Suggested by one of the employees who has got me hooked!) I would recommend this place to anyone! I can't wait to try it for lunch."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme and Duck donuts has nothing on these donuts! I've tried the glaze and apple fritter and they are absolutely delicious! I wish they opened later than 2 because I can't ever get donuts during the week. I guess that's a good thing for my figure, lol."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened next to me! Their donuts and friend chicken sandwiches are great. Donuts are $1-2 and chicken sandwhiches are $4.75 with the option to add a variety of paid and free toppings. There is usually a long line but service is fast. I love their maple bacon doughnut and their classic donut. Their creme brulee donut is actually a little too sweet for me. Their fried chicken is crispy and their biscuits are light and fluffy. There is a lot of parking but sometimes the lot fills up because of the sheer amount of people going to Rise! Be warned that it opens very early in the day and closes at 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends so it's not for late risers!"}
{"text":"I had the pickled jalapeño meatloaf biscuit, it was delicious. Hubby had the country ham which he felt was a bit on the salty side. Kids had donuts. Overall I was pleased with food and service. I will be going back."}
{"text":"So I saw this place yesterday while I was shopping in the area and so I looked them up on here and saw pretty good reviews and + I love biscuits even though it's not good for me. I decided to stop in today for breakfast and ordered my self the righteous chicken biscuit with scrambled eggs and cheese with the hashpuppies, my bf ordered himself the righteous chicken biscuit with mayo & avacado spread. They were delicious, the chicken was seasoned perfectly the biscuit was def a nice size for the price, the hashpuppies were good as well with the cheese mixed with the potatoes.  Def will come back especially since  I live in the area."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life?!?! My sister brought my boyfriend and I to grab breakfast here before we caught our flight out of town for thanksgiving. We came me and him both ordered a Righteous Chicken with scrambled eggs and cheese on it with little orange juices.   Literally the most delicious breakfast sandwich i ever had. The chicken was nice and juicy, i loved how the buttermilk biscuit was nice and fluffy. The eggs and chicken were well seasoned. Sorry mom but these biscuits taste better than what you make hahah. I hope there's a Biscuits rise and donuts in Raleigh because i would definitely be spending my money with this company.  The best time to come is early in the morning, staff is incredibly friendly and the store is nice and neat. The first one was built in Raleigh in Ballantyne and South Charlotte (5 minutes from the South Carolina border)."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The food is good but customer service is non existent. Waited 25 minutes for a simple bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit. While waiting they messed up numerous other orders. One family orders 5 sandwiches and only received 2. After waiting another 5 minutes they demanded a refund and left. Lady that came in after me was given my sandwich. Problem is she ordered it on a roll and not a biscuit. She returned it and they promptly made her another....... on a biscuit. All of this after I'd already complained about waiting for 15 minutes for a simple biscuit. They finally made mine and it had scrambled eggs instead of the fried egg I had ordered. Didn't feel like waiting another untold amount of time for a replacement. Can't imagine this location staying open long if they don't improve their processes."}
{"text":"We live in the Steel Creek area and was super excited when we saw that Rise was opening so nearby. However, since they have opened this location we have gone 4 times but I am not sure I'll go back again. Only once(the very first time we went) have we left the store with what we actually ordered so it is super disappointing each time.   The first time we went was shortly after they opened and they were out of almost everything. We were a little disappointed but understood the demand was high so tried in several other occasions.   Since then we've been given incorrect sandwiches, sandwiches missing components or with the wrong items. We even ordered a box of donuts and were given another customers order!  We didn't notice until getting home, which I'm sure was not only disappointing for us but the other customer.   I will say that from what we have tried the food is alright and I really enjoy the apple fritter (if you can get one). They seem to sell out of donuts fast.   If you can get what you want the food is alright, but I would make sure to check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype about this place and wasn't impressed. Limited seating, no highchairs. Biscuits were a little tough around the edges and the cheese on my sandwich was still cold . No iced coffee option, which was a problem because I wasn't about to drink scalding coffee while holding my toddler on my lap because, oh yeah, no highchairs."}
{"text":"Stopped by in Father's Day and it was extremely packed which was to be expected. After I ordered I immediately got my donut. I also ordered 2 chicken egg and cheese biscuits and 2 orders of the cheesy hash cakes. After waiting 20 mins the manager came out and notified me that the hash cakes were being prepared to be put into the oven he told me it would be another 10-15 minuets. I was fine with that because I was excited to try it. Approximately 7 mins later my name was called and my order was given to me. Once I got home I realized that neither of my biscuits had cheese on them- which I paid of according to my receipt. And the hash cakes were not done ! I called on Monday to see if something could be done. When I called I was told that the manager was not in but the young lady took a message for me with a description of what happened with my order. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't received a phone call back from the manager trying to rectify the situation which is why I'm leaving a review. 2 stars for the donuts."}
{"text":"Creme brûlée donut? It should be called creme your underwear it's that good!!!  Biscuits and other items great too, but can we keep talking about the creme brûlée donut?"}
{"text":"Donuts were a bit off this AM in taste and appearance. For the second time in a row, ordered sandwiches and got biscuits instead. After going for months to the one in Ballantyne I was a little surprised by how little they seemed to care about folks waiting on food or even getting their names right to be called out. They're clearly still working the kinks out here. We'll be back but hope for better."}
{"text":"I was searching for a donut shop close to my sisters house and came across this spot. Ordered a few flavors such as glazed, maple bacon, chocolate chocolate, and creme brûlée. To be honest, I was disappointed with the maple bacon donut and that's what I was looking forward to the most. The maple glaze threw me off....way too sweet.   We had leftovers from this morning and I had to give it another go. The regular glazed donut was AMAZING! It wasn't too sweet and the first bite was soft and it still tasted fresh.   Rise also offers breakfast/regular sandwiches. Next time I go back I would probably try a breakfast sandwich with a side of regular glazed donut ;)"}
{"text":"Another Charlotte place that is let down by awful service... sigh!  We went in early on a Saturday morning.  I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit, coffee and an old-fashioned donut.  My wife got a double-chocolate donut and some of the hashcakes.    The GOOD:  The donuts (especially the old-fashioned) were freakin' delicious.  They were everything that you want a donut to be... moist, sweet and a touch of fat without dripping.  They were flaky/crumbly and were, honestly, the best donuts I've had in a very long time.  The bacon, egg and cheese biscuit was perfect (flaky biscuit, crisp bacon, well cooked egg) and the coffee was simple, but a good basic cup of brown (nothing stunning, but better than you would get in any fast food or convenience store).  My wife loved the hashcakes (giant hashbrowns) that were well seasoned and fried to a deep brown.    The BAD:  We got a bright, fresh faced young man as our cashier and he was great.  My wife had read the menu the night before and was really looking forward to a particular donut... something with a chocolate cream filling.  It wasn't in the case so she asked the guy \"Do you have any of X donut in the back?\"  He was nice, looked into the back and said \"I'm so sorry... I can see a tray back there, but they aren't done yet this morning.\"  My wife changed her order to something in the case and I paid.  When he handed the donuts over the counter a minute later, my wife asked \"Do you know when X might be ready?\" and the young guy looked to an older woman standing next to him (I'm assuming she was a donut maker).  She said \"Don't you sell a donut that isn't in that case\" and then she turned and glared at my wife.  Not just a glance to see who was asking, but a mean, 10-second long \"GO FUCK YOURSELF\" kind of glare... the kind of look that says \"I hope someone beats you with a baseball bat\" kind of look.  We were thinking of checking on our way out to see if donut X was done when we were finished eating, but forget that.  We took our food and left.  SUMMARY:  If we aren't wanted there, we just won't go back.  There's another Rise franchise about the same distance from our home and it's owned by someone else, so it looks like we will be going that way from now on.  It's too bad... the food was wonderful.  The service (from that one woman) was spiteful."}
{"text":"Donut was not at all worth the wait. Had an odd, stale flavor. Folks waiting on actual sandwiches/meals were waiting forever. Overflowing trash cans. Gross. Never again."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are amazing. The biscuits are just ok, which was a little disappointing. The service was good and quick.  I expected a southern place to have  fresh brewed iced tea but they just had bottled.  My husband said the coffee was good"}
{"text":"The donuts were great. I tried the glazed and the strawberry buttercream. I was really impressed with the rich strawberry flavor. It didn't taste artificial at all. I also tried the chicken biscuit and it was just okay. Would try another sandwich next time or just stick to the yummy sweet treats.   The space is small, with limited seating just like the Starbucks that was there previously. Probably wouldn't hang there but great to grab and go."}
{"text":"After weeks of anticipation, my wife finally was able to get us a dozen donuts. We've been looking forward to these fancy donuts since the opening here in steel creek.  So after taking two large bites of the pineapple donut, I asked my wife \"are these supposed to have cream in them?\" She said I thought so. I split the donut in half and saw what was maybe a teaspoon of cream inside. I tasted the cream and it didn't even remotely taste like pineapple.  My wife tried the creme brûlée donut and after 3 bites she found some cream. She was not happy with this purchase. Not what we were expecting at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a biscuit and fell in love. I got their avocado toast, served on a biscuit with fresh tomato slices, siracha sauce and a fried egg. That was a hard decision to make because they now serve a lamb slider. Don't forget the donuts. With one of these menu items could stand on their own the biscuits or the donuts but together they make this place an oasis in an area that is lacking more breakfast options."}
{"text":"Pretty busy! But the lines moved quickly. You need to try the sausage biscuit with gravy, SO GOOD! Of course you can't leave without trying at least one donut! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ok. I tried the chicken biscuit. The chicken was good but the biscuit was average. I was expecting the biscuit to taste better"}
{"text":"This review is based only on customer service because the half dozen donuts I purchased were gone before I got a chance to try them! So, service was nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've debated between two and three stars for Rise because they have pretty tasty and unique donuts, but they also run out of donuts early and have some serious functional flaws.  I haven't ever ordered the biscuit dishes here because I am concerned about the quality of the dish and how long I might have to wait for it.  If they could get these kinks worked out, they could be a great place.  As is, I think they need a lot of improvement in the way things are run.  I have been here on the weekend, once around 9 AM and once around 8 AM.  By 9:00, about 2/3 of their donuts were gone.  Nothing going on in the kitchen led me to believe they had any more donuts made or that they were preparing more donuts.  This seems very strange to me because it was early in the day and they have donuts mentioned in their business name.  When I came at 8 AM on a Sunday, they were already out of glazed donuts and they were running low on at least two types of donuts.  The person in line ahead of me asked about glazed donuts and was simply told they were out.  I finally got up to order, picked out my donuts and paid.  However, rather than getting them out of the case as I ordered, I had to wait for about five minutes for them get them around and put them in a box.  It seems like the trendy thing to do is to have people order at the counter, but there's nowhere to stand, people are clustered around the counter, and it's very inefficient.  And donut prices vary - some of them cost somewhere between $2-4 each.  Some of them are worth it, others are not.  As for the donuts themselves, the salted caramel and the creme brulee donuts are my favorite.  The salted caramel is quite salty but the cake donut is moist and not overly heavy.  The creme brulee has a crunch sugar crust, but surprisingly it is not overly sweet.  The creme filling is balanced and has a good consistency.  I've tried the basil pineapple donut, which is just ok and you can't really taste the basil in the filling.  The tiramisu donut had almost no coffee flavor and was overly sweet, which seems to be a prevailing problem with some of their donuts.  Overall, I will say all of the donuts I've tried had a soft, light texture and are not dried out, which makes them better than some of the chain donuts in the area.  While I like a couple of the donuts a lot, having to get here early or run the risk of not getting donuts is annoying.  I also greatly dislike the set-up of ordering at the counter.  I don't know if it's worth it to come back."}
{"text":"good customer service. clean bathrooms. good food. only downfall, not a big selection in donuts. dunking donuts cheaper with more variety."}
{"text":"$4/apple fritter  $1/glazed donut   As I was ordering last week, I was told they were out of glazed. Yet the cashier didn't reach and grab the apple fritter so the guy next to me, at the other register, got to get the fritter.   The question begs:who gets this? Why didn't she see something wrong with disappointing me with \"were out of everything\" & having me walk away empty handed.   I was most bothered and disgusted. I tried contacting the Manger by calling that morning.... NO ANSWER.   I joined their private FACEBOOK group to ask for someone in a position of authority to address this because it is not just a matter of inconvenience as they are out the way, this isn't a matter of poor service because maybe this called for another level of thinking and maybe someone doesn't get it because they are inept, but this is something I'm saying as an ugly thing as it perplexed me - \"what should be done?\"   What I do know:  1) I should have been able to walk out with at least something.  2) The place should not have been out of glazed donuts at 9am maybe not even 9pm (yeah, yeah, yeah... I know they're not open past 2pm but the point is glazed donuts are the simplest to make) 3) Someone should have answered the phone.  4) Someone should have gotten a manager, owner or someone and again.... 5) NO CUSTOMER SHOULD WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING, NADA, NILCH.   At this point, I figured I'd swing by for aonther try as I am going to Zoe's but the way my carb count as been set up.... it would have to be a day or week of prepping for the numbers.   5 stars for cleaniness 4 stars for the menu layout and number of people working 0 stars for availability  1 star for slow ringing which may have contributed to me not even getting the apple fritter in the case  0 stars for limited thinking and trouble shooting."}
{"text":"Holy biscuits and donuts!!!  This place opened a few months ago in the Lake Wylie area. In my poor efforts to avoid bread, I got hungry and decided to eat a freaking biscuit!  So, it's Thanksgiving week my sister and her BF arrived in Charlotte to catch their flight. I'm not cooking this year for Thanksgiving, there's literally no food in my house! HA!!   With three hours to kill, I couldn't take my family to Chick-fil-A or McDonald's for breakfast. I have a reputation to uphold. We decided to visit Rise Biscuits Donuts around 9AM. The restaurant was empty around this time. In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I ordered the special \"Smoked Turkey\"! Such a fantastic combination of ingredients!  Smoked Turkey breast (of course) with cranberry sauce, brie cheese and crispy onions on a fluffy biscuit! Oh my turkey butt, this is the best thing I ever ate! My sister and her BF ordered the Righteous Chicken sandwich with egg. This sandwich is way better than Chick-fil-A to be honest. Random fun fact! You can ask for grilled chicken if fried chicken isn't your thing.   I'm highly impressed with Rise Biscuits Donuts! The food and level of service is fast and friendly. We chatted with one of the ladies working there, she told us about the company and the other 12 locations. I look forward to coming here again soon!!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM. When I was immediately intrigued when I heard about Rise. I mean, they specialize in biscuits AND donuts!! BOTH! Obviously, I had to try one of each. I ordered a standard BEC, cheddar hash cake, and a smores donut. The BEC was huge! The hash cake was pretty good.   I was kind of disappointed with the donut. It wasn't well balanced. It mainly just tasted like a chocolate covered donut. Yes I know that chocolate is a main ingredient with smores, but the donut could've used more marshmallow! The lady at the counter said that the salted caramel is the most popular donut. I'll try that one next time."}
{"text":"Really solid showing for the new breakfast place in Charlotte. There was a line out the door but it moved quickly and there was a representative outside handing out free donut holes. Yay free food! Since they were out of my two choices I opted for the traditional chocolate topped donut. It was light and sugary and delicious! I also had a chicken biscuit - and it was huge! The fried chicken was surprisingly moist and the kale pesto sauce I had with it was strong. Overall one donut and a biscuit sand which was more than I could eat. All said some of the kinks we experienced were probably just opening day issues. It was extremely loud and the worker at the check out counter didn't know what was in one of their sauces."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, amazing donuts, the best biscuits and strong coffee!! This place is dangerous if you are watching your figure. I dream about the donuts here."}
{"text":"This place has done nothing but gone downhill after it opened. When it first opened, I would have ranked it closer to 4 stars. This time, I arrived around 9:30am on a Saturday, what I would assume to be one of their peak times. The doughnut selection was already limited. I ordered one of their specials - a kielbasa pig in a blanket. I was told that there were none prepared and it would be a 20 minute wait. For only 2.5 hrs into opening, you would think that they would have done a better job with food prep of one of their featured items. I subsequently ordered the Fried Green Tomato biscuit (added bacon), a chicken biscuit, and 3 doughnuts. The wait for these items was relatively short - likely less than 3 minutes. However when I got in the car I realized that the fried green tomato did not have all the ingredients. Had I not have added bacon, it would have literally been just a biscuit with fried green tomatoes on it. Where was the pimento cheese?!?!?! At least let me add the bacon for free if you are out of it. Nobody gets this biscuit for the tomatoes - we get it for the pimento cheese! This place is in serious need of some new management and a good quality control program."}
{"text":"I ordered a buffalo chicken biscuit, they gave me a plain chicken biscuit and charged me the buffalo price. I should've checked the bag before I left. Oh well, since I was already 5 miles away and omw to work, it wasn't worth it to come back for a $6 biscuit. The chicken biscuit was decent, crispy and well-seasoned. I also tried their bavarian cream, I expected the cream to have a thick creamy flavor like how any authentic french bakery always make. But instead, I got this weird taste, could be too much liqueur, the cream was liquid, it was dripping out the moment I took a bite out of it. Definitely not my go to place for a quick snack."}
{"text":"Gourmet priced items at above average flavor.  Anything food than donuts requires a wait. Food is ordered at the counter and you stand and wait for your food; however, at checkout there's an option to give a tip."}
{"text":"I was going to try the ballantyne location but recently moved closer to the steel creek location so I tried it today for the first time. I took a minute to look over the menu and decided on a bologna egg and cheese, a hash cake and a chocolate chocolate donut.    When I approached the counter I was quickly greeted by the cashier and ordering was easy.  I received my donut immediately and the biscuit and hash cake took no more than 3-5 mins tops, and was fresh and hot when I received it.    Biscuit was excellent I would put it a step above fast food biscuits for sure, there were 3 larger slices of Bologna that hung over the biscuit and the egg was fresh fried and cooked perfectly.    The hash cake was good but a little small for the price and a bit oily so I set it on a few napkins for a couple mins before I tried it, it's a conglomeration of hash browns, cheese, and what appeared to be some herbs or seasoning of some kind and is deep fried, it was good but lacked a little flavor overall, maybe needed a pinch of salt.   The chocolate chocolate donut was a cake donut with a little frosting to hold on top the chocolate crumbles, and it was a damn good donut, it was moist and tender, not dense like some cake donuts can be.    I was greeted by the owner and asked how I enjoyed my breakfast and I spoke with him for a few minutes, he was very nice and helpful.  I will be back"}
{"text":"First time visitor to this location. I ordered an Apple Fritter and a Creme Brule doughnut. Two items $6. It was at best ok.  There are multiple eateries in close proximity and with the cost per item being on the pricey side this makes \"Rise\" a hard to defend choice. I don't have an issue with paying for quality but being pricey just to be trendy is not something I make a practice of.  Nothing special here...been there,done that."}
{"text":"Just got ready, left to pick us both up biscuits from Rise to start our day off together right. This was my fourth time there, the biscuits are good - mainly because of the odd combos, they're not spectacular or anything - the space is awkward and they always seem to have trouble keeping up. The newness has worn off, management just apparently sucks. Walked up to order and was told because they were so backed up they were not taking food orders at this time. WTF; definitely my last visit and I will tell anyone I know to avoid this place. Super poorly run. Bye bye, hope they put something better in that space."}
{"text":"Amazing! So excited to see Rise open in Steele Creek. We visited this am for a sneak preview and were really impressed. The location is clean and inviting, they totally renovated from Starbucks. I had the creme brûlée donut which was one of the best donuts I have ever tried. My son had the maple bacon- how can you not love a donut with a strip of bacon on top?! He also had the cheerwine which had a great flavor. I brought salted caramel, Oreo and strawberry buttercream to work and they were all gone within 5 minutes. Very friendly staff and a delicious menu. You should definitely add to your list of places to try."}
{"text":"Meh. Unfortunately, this best describes this place. Mediocre biscuits at best in the South is a sin that you may not forgive of them. They have some nicely creative recipes, and many adds for the biscuits, but they cannot stand on their own and really need those additional flavors.   The donuts are at or below Grocery store level. Almost too sweet when glazed. Lacking depth they play on sweet flavored and riffs on creative flavors made famous by others.   Sadly, quite certain I won't be back. I had high hopes though."}
{"text":"Just tired this place with my mom this morning.  The place is not cheap but the staff is nice and the food was extra delicious.  Their biscuits are huge and fresh.  They are a great addition to Rivergate and I plan to return next time to try their coffee and donuts. I encourage you all to give it a go and bring a friend or two."}
{"text":"Rise is an enigma to me. The sandwiches and biscuits are excellent....not just good, they're crazy good. The doughnuts look even better, but none have actually been that good. The other strange thing is there is always one employee who is on their service A game every time....guests seem to be invisible to the rest to the point of ignoring you even when you ask a question. Maybe it's part of their \"thing\", but it's weird"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since they opened a few months ago and I finally made it. I'm so glad Steele Creek is finally getting a few good restaurants! It's a small place and it's pretty popular on a Saturday morning. There's some bar stool style seating inside as well as tables outside.   We got the chicken fried steak biscuit sandwich, the Cubano biscuit sandwich, the maple bacon bar, and the creme brûlée donut. I'll start by saying that they got our biscuits wrong - they gave us a fried chicken biscuit and the Cubano was on a roll instead of a biscuit. The were really nice when we pointed it out and let us keep the food along with giving us the right food. They also threw in some complimentary hashpuppies.  The Cubano was amazing. It was executed well and the flavors worked great on a biscuit. I was not a fan of the chicken fried steak. It was really tough and didn't have much flavor, but the biscuit was delicious. Of the two donuts, I think I liked the creme brûlée a little more, but they were both fantastic. The maple bacon bar came with a full slice of crispy bacon on top.   They also serve lunch which I definitely want to come back to try. Come support one of the few good restaurants in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and had the old glory donut and fried green tomato sandwich. Sandwich was just \"ok\" but the donut was amazing! It had a lemony filling with raspberries and blueberries. Reasonably price too. I do wish they had tables and high chairs though"}
{"text":"My wife declared their Creme Brulee donut the second best donut she's ever had in her life, after the Krispy Kreme original glazed. So Rise has *that* going for it.  I chose the country ham biscuit, adding pimento cheese and a fried egg for a monstrosity of a breakfast as the donut itself is quite large and with all this stuff on it, there's a full meal. Delicious, tasty, rather salty ham and the biscuit as well, but filling and tasty.  Downside? The coffee was awful. Very strong, over roasted, it could not be saved by cream and sugar. Wow."}
{"text":"Not as good as Ballantyne location - biscuits too hard, don't give you enough egg on sandwich."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and everything seems amazing.. my boyfriend ordered a sausage biscuit and it seemed good. He said there wasn't much distinguishing it from a McDonald's biscuit. I got doughnuts and they were the worst doughnuts I've ever had. Too sweet and they were cold and hard. They tasted like they were made a couple days before and had been sitting out. I didn't even finish them. I'm super disappointed. Really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Good donuts, but you'd better go EARLY before they run out:( 2 weekends in a row (1:10 and 1:30) they had NO donuts left. Considering that they close at 2:00, you would hope this doesn't happen--especially on the weekend. Once you fool me......"}
{"text":"I just came to this location today with my son and my chicken was raw in the inside. The cashier asked me did I want the cook to make me a new order and I said no I just want my money back. I am glad I looked at my food before giving it to my son. The manager didn't do anything and her apology was not sincere. I will never return the disorganization should have been a red flag and the fact they didn't have donuts because they ran out. Well if you make donuts fresh then remake some."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out and see what all the rave was about for their custom breakfast biscuits. I ordered a fried chicken biscuit with avacado spread i loved the fried chicken the biscuit itself was ok i was expecting it to be more like a down down south cooked in your grandmas kitchen type of biscuit. Overall everything was good,no complaints. The guy at the register was a hoot and kept me laughing when he asked what would i like to drink i replied OJ for orange juice and he replied one bronco coming up hey i love the juice man! Nice touch having the box inside to ask how they are doing ! I hear they have great donoughts i have to stop by one day just to grab one,in the inside there is a picture of a guy eating a giagantic donought too funny!"}
{"text":"I have become a regular to grab a donut at rise whenever near them since their recent opening. Dunkin Donut and grocery store donuts all taste the same. When I eat a Dinkin Donut, I always regret the wasted calories. Rise donuts are an investment in calories. The only reason I give them a 4 instead of 5 is that I bought a biscuit that looked amazing, but was so salty that I didn't even finish it. You should go there for a donut for sure."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Me and BF both got wrong order and so did others. Food was alright."}
