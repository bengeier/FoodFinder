{"text":"I was asked if I'd like two pickles or one, so of course I said two please... but only got one  .... why even ask????? Does that mean if you ask for one, you don't get any?????? Just curious.... also very expensive sandwich."}
{"text":"They make a good Ruben sandwich.  I'm not crazy about their pizzas.  The staff at this one is a little unfriendly.  The previous owner was so nice so I was sad when the management changed.  I haven't gone as often now."}
{"text":"The staff here are always friendly and we like this is convient to our house. The fiesta chicken is my favorite and check out the jalape√±o bread if you like a little extra kick"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch. This location seems to run out of chips, bread, cups, etc, a lot so be prepared. The prices are great in comparison to JJ's or Firehouse. They started providing nutritional facts at the register for those health conscious folks! Be sure to try their new pick two combo for lunch!"}
