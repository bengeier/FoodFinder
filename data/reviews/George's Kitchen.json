{"text":"The food is excellent. We've enjoyed several of the pastas, pizzas, salads, and platters. The Mediterranean Pasta is a favorite with the house salad but we always get the seafood platter. The seafood is fresh and cooked perfectly. The owner's and staff are wonderful. All are friendly, knowledgeable regarding the food, and nice people. We stopped in a few months ago to try it out. We've been back every week or so."}
{"text":"First time here, really impressed! Adorable inside, clean and open kitchen concept. Food was yum! We split the gyro fries, chicken jalape√±o pita and a Greek salad, all were delicious. This may have just became our new neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. It is excruciatingly loud, so we decided to do take out. We ordered the Jim's gyro with 1/2 lb meat to split. We were very disappointed when we got home and found about 1/4 pound of meat with french fries and salad on top of that.   Not what we planned."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, the people friendly, and I am in love with their Gyro Pita sandwich, which is loaded with meat and makes a complete meal for me.  Their food is consistently great!"}
{"text":"If I could give 100 stars I would! I came across George's Kitchen because it's one of the few places that deliver to my work. They are ALWAYS super fast, super friendly, and very accommodating (I'm kind of a picky eater). I think they've memorized my order by now ha Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service & great prices. We have tried the sandwiches, the salads, pizzas and everything is top quality. Family run and they take great pride in the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times than I can count now -- gyros, salads, pizza, and the heavenly baklava.  Really pleased this restaurant has opened up in my neighborhood, the food is great.  I'm finishing up their steak salad now with the house dressing.  I'm not even a salad person and this salad is yummy.  I haven't had one thing from here that wasn't delicious.  There's something called a Baklava Sundae, I eye it every time I go in.  Definitely in my future."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. Probably the best Greek meal I've ever had. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Got a carry out from here last night. We ordered at 7:30 and they close at 8, so they didn't have any soup left which was a bummer. I was super excited for a new Greek style place to open, phoenix is kind of lacking in that department. I'm from the Detroit area so I love my Greek food, there's no shortage of hot, fresh Greek food there. We ordered two chicken pitas. They were really good, the pita bread was delicious but they were very small for the price (10.50 I believe). My husband was still hungry after his. The fries were good as well and so was the Greek pasta salad. All in all it was good but next time I will go to Greektown or blue moon grill. They have larger portions and better prices."}
{"text":"Overpriced for a restaurant that doesn't have servers. The hummus was ok, but be prepared to buy more pita bread as it doesn't come with enough for all of hummus. I prefer the hummus across the street at the Vig. We tries the georgies pizza which was pretty tasty and had a nice crust(chicken,garlic, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes). One of the girls that works there was outside smoking and I did not see her wash her hands when returning to work. She was also somewhat sitting on the ground behind the counter on her phone. The staff seemed like they were bored and just leaning on the counter talking. I prefer a more professional staff when paying these prices. The inside was clean and modern with nice views of 16th st. I will not return...I'd prefer to go Greektown if I'm in the mood for Greek food."}
{"text":"Oh my word. My taste buds are having a revival. The food is incredible: fresh, delicious, and t a s t y. The service was friendly and efficient. I'm going to make this one of my regular haunts. I was going to take a picture of the food but I ate it before I got the chance. Try the baklava."}
{"text":"Meh. Bland chicken kabob, bland rice, even the tzatziki was bland. Maybe they ran out of garlic. Very disappointing, especially after great review in New Times. They gave us a free sample of the baklava but even that was average."}
{"text":"We have been there twice! Once with a large group to celebrate my husband's birthday and today just the two of us. The service is always quick and friendly. All of our friends loved it including those who have traveled to Greece with us. The atmosphere is really nice. They are accommodating to put tables together for a group. The food passes my Greek test as I am Greek American. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped into George's Kitchen on 16th No. of Bethany this evening to get some take out Greek food hoping it would be good.  The food wasn't good--IT WAS FABULOUS!!  Had the goat cheese salad with grilled salmon and the feta tomato fries and I'm in epicurean heaven right now....the food at George's Kitchen is fresh, fast, and utterly delicious!  The portion sizes are big and filling with enough to make scrumptious lunch left-overs tomorrow.  The staff was very friendly making the atmosphere inside the restaurant pleasant and comfortable. I came in during a shift change and even the evening crew walked in greeting and helping customers from the moment they came thru the doors.  I LOVE George's Kitchen and can honestly say it's going to become a regular, weekly stop for fresh, delicious, healthy Greek food."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special about this place. We ordered 3-4 different things and not one thing had a taste. Extremely bland and plain. If you're a bad cook you can just make this at home."}
{"text":"Loved the food, had it to go so I couldn't rate the service but it came out quick and FRESH. Prices aren't cheap but not expensive and you do get big portions. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Loses a star due to the fact that the entire inside is hard surfaces with NO acoustical treatment.  There was a large table of women that were so loud, my husband had to stuff napkins in his ears, until we finally moved out side.  Even the employees were complaining how loud it was.  However, the food was outstanding.  Staff is attentive and friendly.  Pizza is excellent--love the crust-- and the gyro dinner with a Greek salad was fabulous.  Walking distance from our house, so will definitely be a regular place for us.  Can't wait to go back and hope that they do something for the bad acoustics soon!"}
{"text":"You have to come here! The goat cheese salad is fantastic and the gyro meat actually tastes like lamb - fantastic! Fast service, fresh food and friendly staff. A favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous Meal !!  I had the Greek salad with Gyro meat and my husband had the Chicken Pita. Absolutely the best we have had. Everyone was friendly a nice urban atmosphere! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super, super delicious and fresh addition to the 16th St and Bethany area!! Lunch specials are a good portion and great price! The Chicken Feta Salad, the chicken was super flavorful with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Great food that you would expect at a very high end restaurant.  Had the Saganaki and a pizza!  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to George's Kitchen and will definitely NOT be our last. Great food and super friendly owners. It'll be tough but save room for dessert - homemade baklava and Greek cookies."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Jim's Pita was ah-mazing. My husband had the steak pita and loved it!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Best gryo pita in town, but soups and salads are also delish!! Their pita bread is always warm and fresh, the gyro meat is so tend it practically melts in your mouth.  My grandma loves the chicken lemon soup.   Most importantly they are consistently good. I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little place!! Love the pizza.  We had a pepperoni/mushroom and a Greek pizza. We also topped it off with a baklava sundae.  Like the happy hour beer/wine prices.  3rd time here and we'll continue to eat here!!"}
{"text":"I was brought in here by a friend who lives in the area.  It was great quality food.  Fair prices.  Nice, clean, relaxing atmosphere.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't normally give 5 stars but I was really impressed with this salad! I had the saganaki with gyro; super fresh greens, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives, radishes served with warm and fluffy pita bread... Mmmmmmmmn!!!  Really delicious. I don't know why it took me so long to try this place as I live in this neighborhood, but I'm sure glad I did!"}
{"text":"My out-of-town guest and I stopped in here for lunch after a long hike.  Really welcoming staff, nice open atmosphere.  I had the saganaki salad with chicken and my friend had the salmon.  Both were fantastic.  Flavorful, everything cooked perfectly.  We also had a hummus app.  Very large and really delicious.  I am a fan of greek food and this is now my favorite place in the metro area."}
{"text":"Great place! I had their gyro pita with fries and it was all very good! The meat was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor! The tzatziki sauce was on the side but the pita was perfect without it. They did cut the tomatoes into bigger pieces which I didn't care for too much, but the overall flavor was perfect. Can't wait to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. They have the best pizza I have ever tasted. This place makes their food from scratch and you can't get more fresh than that. I really look forward to eating here and while I have a hard time getting excited about food or going out to eat; I get excited about eating here. This is one of my all-time favorite places to eat. You must give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a family restaurant in every sense of the word. Ellen and Jim (who are longtime Phoenix restaurateurs) and their family began at this location more than a year ago, and the place is indeed family-friendly as well (not to mention spotless). Most important, however, the food here is consistently outstanding, and always at a reasonable price. You will find a full array of Mediterranean fare; the saganaki is a particular weakness of mine, and for years, I've firmly believed that Jim makes the best Greek dressing on the planet. The meats are perfectly prepared and seasoned, and there are fine vegetarian selections as well. The breads and pizza dough are addictive (bread-baking is part of Jim's pedigree). And you'll never encounter more gracious and welcoming hosts."}
{"text":"Just went to George's Kitchen. It was delicious!! I had the Greek salad with grilled salmon and it was seriously the BEST I've ever had. Try out this new place. It is family owned and they are also very helpful and friendly. Super clean. Walk up and order. Plenty of tables and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends to have dinner.  Perfect service, perfect meal and perfect atmosphere!  The veggies for the salads were incredibly crisp and well matched. The main entr√©e consisted of a platter of gyro meat, marinated chicken kabobs, long grained rice and a seasoned spinach and cheese type of 'crepe' (the name of the item escapes me at the moment).  Although a few of us live in the East Valley, my friends and I decided to  make a point of visiting regularly--it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"What a local gem! Since we first discovered this Greek restaurant, we've hardly missed a week coming here. The pizzas and salads are some of the best around and there is rarely a wait. Service is excellent and this is a family owned restaurant where they recognize you and make you feel like you are part of their family. Free baklava samples satisfy the sweet tooth. And they deliver! We want to share this awesome place, though I hope it doesn't get as busy as some of the other north central restaurants around. Thanks, George and family!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went there today with my one year old daughter (who loves Greek food) and received the best food and service. We got the hummus and chicken salad lunch special. My salad was so fresh and everything tasted great!  It's clean and has great ambiance for lunch. My only complaint--it's so far from my house ."}
{"text":"Great spot! Just north of an amazing corridor of restaurants. Decided to try this place out since it received so many good reviews. The food is fresh and made to order. We had the Greek plate, and chicken kabobs, Greek salad and chicken lemon soup! Everything was delicious! The owner came out and chatted us up! All homemade sauces and marinades. Check out this gem!"}
{"text":"Topped our girls weekend off with this jewel of a find. Amazing food, great service, clean, and nice atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and try this place out!!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time for lunch.  I love their gyros and the lemon soup!  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. We will be back! Ordered the hummus appetizer, Greek platter and 2 drinks... Total $25.....It's a lot of food. Fresh, flavorful, so good. The place is super clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped here on impulse and couldn't get over how great the food was! Ordered the Feta Tomato Fries and the Jims Pizza. Pizza had just the right amount of sauce, cheese, chicken, onions & jalape√±os!  Bathrooms were super clean also  Definitely coming back when I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"Went to try out the new place in the hood this week. It was good but not great. Restaurant itself is very loud because it is a big open space. Made it extremely difficult to talk with my family.  Both of the Gyro's we tried were yummy and the Alfredo too. Best Pitas I have ever had actually. Unfortunately the soup and the pasta salad had zero flavor, they need to work on those items. We will try again but might get the food to go."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was wonderful. O ordered the salmon and shrimp (bigger portion than I anticipated). Also came with a side Greek salad & had a glass of the res blend wine. It's quiet and relaxing.  Will be coming back more often to try other items in the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place, the gyro with the soup is a tasty treat. The casual interior is comfortable and welcoming."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!! Awesome food. Can't talk highly enough about this place! The salad was the bomb and the lamb to die for!  Wonderful service and atmosphere. George's was the best place to go for a date night. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Worst baklava ever.  I've never had any this bad, not even from a mall food court place back when the Fiesta Mall still had Macy's.  The bottom layer was burnt.  The inner layers weren't golden and crispy but white and pasty.  The worst part was that it has NO honey or syrup at all on the inside layers.  None.  It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts.  There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up, and that's it.  I don't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either.  It's awful, and definitely not worth the $3.50 they're charging for two small triangular pieces.  Costco and AJ's both have superior product, and Costco even manages a shelf-stable baklava that is much more moist, even if not drenched in honey or syrup like some plates (most anything would be moister than this was).  I got the calamari again and the serving size was very small for the $9.50 they're charging (I'm pretty sure it's much smaller than what I got last time).  It could've used a crispier coating, and was slightly too rubbery.  The pita was still quite good.  They really need to get fabric or rubber pads for the metal feet of the chairs in the dining room as the noise against the flooring is awful.  I don't think I'll be back.  That truly bad baklava was so disappointing."}
{"text":"As others noted, it is expensive for counter service restaurant, but clean. And unlike other posts, no one is handing out baklava after your meal.  What is a stand out is the sauce with the gyro.  Yes super tasty.  Meat was ok.  Overall, might stop back in, but there are other counter service options."}
{"text":"Great place for greek food.  Tasty & authentic. The greek salad was fresh & crisp, the gyros were delicious.  The spanakopita was good too. :)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for delivery in Phoenix. A family run business with fantastic food with fresh ingredients. I never write Yelp reviews but this place is definitely worthy of the praise. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss today was not their best service delivery and food was cold upon arrival had the straw in my drink and holding it like it was hers. Gross. 2.45 for a large coke wasted. Won't drink it!! And like heck if I want her to come back with one she spit in. No thanks. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great salad! I seriously cannot recommend the salad more. And the pita was great too. But damn. Their salads are great"}
{"text":"friendly staff and great food. when we ordered,  we requested several \"please hold the...\", and the indeed held all the requested items,  which, from experience is a rare and wonderous thing...and we didn't get stink-eye over it. the foid itself was delicious. ..Chicken was spiced perfectly. ..and little salt, and little savory. Fries were perfectly;  slightly crispy without being burnt, or greasy. ..and just enough salt. organic green salad with gyro meat was nicely seasoned, was tender and not greasy. can't wait to go back for the tomato feta fries."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went here for the first time last night at the recommendation of someone who lives in the neighborhood. My friend and I both got the steak pita with a side salad. I had already devoured half of mine before I realized I had forgotten to take a picture for the review. Portions were generous, I had to take some home and here's the best part- they were delicious cold, too! Pricing was moderate- we got 2 pitas, 2 side salads, a beer and a soda for $34. I will definitely be back, and I'll be sending friends and family here too!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.... Great salads great service. Love the place. Would say that you have to try their Greek salad. A must."}
{"text":"I was completely turned off when I came by to pick up my to-go order and witnessed the owner throwing a head of cabbage on the chopping table due to anger towards the rest of the staff. I'm not sure if he realized I was sitting right in front of the bar while he was having a fit but it was truly an awkward thing to witness and made me extremely uncomfortable. I understand there are overwhelming days at work but I don't believe it needs to be witnessed by customers. I can't get over the thought that the same cabbage he was tossing around went into my salad. And because of this... we never returned."}
{"text":"The food is good but I am amazed at how rude a lot of the staff is. I have been treated poorly while picking up to-go orders and so have my friends. I have been in the restaurant business for many years and I get it. But there is no excuse for making your customers feel unwanted and uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"BEST Greek salad!!! The people are ALWAYS so nice. You definitely get what you pay for. The portions are good and the food quality is fresh! Love love LOVE this place! Also- we've got Georges catered before and I will admit... They give you a LOT of food. So keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites! I order or visit at least twice a week. The menu is wide with variety and everything is always so fresh! They place beautiful fresh flowers at every table and the staff is always so warm and welcoming. Try the Greek salad! It's by far one of the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This is simply the best Greek place in Phx.  We go once a week and it's the best.  Jim is a good guy who makes you feel like your in the plaka in Athens Greece. I recommend this restaurant. I love the pizza and gyros"}
{"text":"Food 5/5 & Service 4/5. We come here all the time.  Food: Homemade pitas, delicious gyros, and THE BEST lemon chicken rice soup I've ever had (it's addictive; I can't wait to go back)! We've had the kebabs, pasta, pizza, gyro platter, and baklava (they usually have big samples on the counter!) and never been disappointed. Also, really generous portions. You'll definitely have enough to take home and eat for another meal. You're missing out if you don't eat here.   Service: They were really kind to us and very welcoming, even though we showed up less than 30 minutes before closing. Not the most helpful at answering questions, but definitely adequate. We've never had unusually slow service here, even though we're never the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Extremely noisy. There were only a few other tables having lunch when I was there, but it was still very loud. It's a big, open space so every noise echoes. They need to do something about it. The food was good, but a little pricey: $14 for Greek salad with Gyro meat and an iced tea."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently 5 min away from my house. The pita bread was my favorite. Wish there could have been more since there was more hummus than pita. I had Jim's pita w/ gyro and hubs had the jalape√±o chicken pita, both were juicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Gyros are delicious- soft pita. Love the Tzitziki sauce, and the fries are awesome- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. No ketchup needed!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum! This place has amazing food and friendly staff!  The food comes out hot and fresh every time! The restaurant is clean and has a great and welcoming feel. You got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Wow!  If you haven't been in to try their amazing food, you are missing out!  We had the Greek and Saganaki Salads and they were amazing! Best Pita ever!  I'm so glad we stopped in to check this place out and will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Another great neighborhood spot! Had their calamari, Greek salad and a veggie pita. The wife and I enjoyed it all! And to top it off, the owner stopped by for a quick chat. You don't get that type of service these days, so it was a nice gesture. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped in last minute today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  I got the Greek salad with chicken and tried the hummus app.  Everything was made well, good portions and very flavorful.  As far as service they do a good job.  FYI - I was expecting a sit down and order restaurant but it's a stand in line, order and seat yourself which I was fine with.  If there was anything they could work on its the interior decor - just a bit plain.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is good, and the place is clean. Service is good, but not very friendly. Be sure and get a side Greek salad. The spanakopita is just ok, but the Gyros meat is very good."}
{"text":"Such a nice neighborhood restaurant for quick food! I'm so glad I found it on Yelp and am looking forward to trying more items on the menu.   I stopped in the other day for takeout and ordered the goat cheese salad with chicken, an order of spanokopita and some baklava. Three orders of baklava to be exact - and no, I did not eat all of that myself. I think the total came out to something around $35.  While I was waiting for my order, I spoke with a gentleman that worked there about spanokopita and baklava. He told me his secret to keeping the baklava light after I told him I tried to make it before but it's so much work.   The goat cheese salad comes with 2 pieces of fried goat cheese, which is plenty and also half of an hard boiled egg, black olives, onions, tomato, cucumbers and fresh greens. Everything seemed really fresh in my salad and it was enough to share.   Our spanakopita was a nice addition to the meal. It came with 3 pieces and some tzatziki sauce. Definitely very filling. My boyfriend's mom is Greek and makes baklava from time to time. This reminded me of hers and I wish I had ordered more! Just another reason to stop by here the next time I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"Such amazing food. Wonderful flavor, fresh food, one of the best meals we've had on our trip. The hummus, pita, gyros, and baklava were all spectacular"}
{"text":"Artful Greek cuisine. Steak pita and tiropita  are highly recommended. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove by today and thought we would give it a try. We had tastings of 4 things. Hummus, pizza, calamari and a chicken gyro. The food for me was a complete hit. Pizza was very good, not to much crust and not to big. Just right! Calamari was perfectly cooked and served with a small chunk of feta. Which I have to admit I do not think was going to work. But it did! The hummus was very good with the olive oil and a hint of garlic. The gyro was tender and yummy! For those who make yummy sounds while eating good food. This is a must try. Service was great. Two things........The music is wayyyyyy to loud and the fresh brewed ice tea was a little sour......But our experience with the food was awesome....."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick lunch. Ordered side salad and hawiaan  pizza. The pizza was very thin and  crusty.  Not much red sauce but nice and crunchy.  I loved the pizza .I caution  those that do not like hard crust . The staff was friendly.  Also tried  side order of sausage.  It was good and a little  tangy and very lean"}
{"text":"We had George's Kitchen cater a lunch in our office yesterday, and NO LESS than 10 people said it was the best lunch we've ever had brought in. Everyone RAVED about it, coming back for seconds and thirds. And I can attest, it was delicious. We had the gigantic greek salad, chicken skewers, gyro meat, spanakopita (OMG), rice, and pitas. Usually we have leftovers after a lunch meeting...not so this time. Thanks George (whoever you are)! We'll definitely be ordering from you again SOON.  :)"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey when some Greek places can do more food for $1 or so less, but the quality really makes up for it. Didn't get a chance to try a pizza which seems to be their specialty, but the salads are great, and the gyros are a step above many others. Location is a little big, so it can get loud with poor acoustics and energetic children, but it's a good atmosphere still"}
{"text":"We went last week and would go back! We had the Greek salad with chicken, and a steak pita. Both were good and recommended. A little pricey for a casual feeling restaurant. We want to go back to try the pizza since we live so close!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to North Central. Delicious, fresh food with a clean, upbeat ambiance. Attentive, friendly staff. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Souvlaki salad at least once a week. The chicken is cooked just right, the veggies are always fresh and the dressing is delicious. The portion is large enough that I have another meal for next day. I try to support local as often as possible and will always support George's Kitchen."}
{"text":"This is a hidden neighborhood gem! The food, with many amazing Greek options, is extremely flavorful. I think the Restaurant's name may be misleading...  We had a Gyro platter with an absolutely delicious Greek salad as a starter. Also: the waiter brought us each a complimentary piece of baklava at the end of our meal. So good!! This is a clean, well designed restaurant on 16th Street that everyone in the hood should visit--and soon!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE George's Kitchen. The pita is always fresh!!  The jalape√±o pita is top notch. They always help us try new entrees and never disappoint. Do yourself a favor and try this local, family business."}
{"text":"Best place I have ever been to. The customer service was beyond amazing and I was treated just like family. Everyone had a smile on their face and Angela was so warm and welcoming. I am from out of town but I am willing to drive the 6 hours to eat here every weekend. The food took me to another level and i am astonished."}
{"text":"I had a delicious Greek pizza. It was baked to perfection. I was given a baklava sample and was in Heaven!"}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times to try different things. I had the chicken salad and last time I ordered the Gyro sandwich. The salad was good. I was disappointed with the gyro. It did not look or taste like it came off of the spicket. The atmosphere is clean and nice and the lady who took our order was very friendly. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich and he loved it. I might try that next time."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!!  Food is fresh, made from scratch and so flavorful!  I like the Chicken Mediterranean pita! Yum-o!!!!!  Staff is very, very friendly, family owned, place is extremely clean and food is outstanding!!!!  Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by right before they closed. Despite our inconvenient timing, they were extremely friendly and served us without hesitation. There was plenty to choose from on their menu, but we both picked their mega Gyros. They were delicious! We even had some leftovers to bring home. It also came with a lemon chicken soup which my wife can't stop talking about. It was really tasty. As mentioned in other reviews, the restaurant has a spot on the counter for free samples . We tried their baklava and it was great.  I can't say enough good things about this place. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean food in Phoenix . . . always delish"}
{"text":"The best pita I've had in a VERY long time. The hummus appetizer could use a bit more flavor. The environment is clean and modern...really enjoyed! Will go back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Appropriate service. Very nice interior. Lemon soup was delicious and the complimentary baklava was extremely tasty!  I'll definitely come back for more!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about George's Kitchen.  I've had the salads, salmon, gyros, chicken, fish and chips, subs and pizzas.  No matter what I order I love it!  The Greek platter has been my favorite lately.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  This is a family owned and run business who take pride in providing fresh food.  The owner's father, Jim, talked to our table one evening about getting fresh food daily for the restaurant.  Oh and the wine, Greek beer and baklava never disappoint as well."}
{"text":"Yum...this place is delicious!  I stopped in for lunch yesterday and enjoyed the gyro pita lunch special with lemon orzo soup.  The staff was very friendly and checked on me a few times throughout my lunch, the atmosphere was nice, but nothing special, and the food was fresh, flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Love George's Kitchen! Their Greek salad with chicken is a weekly favorite. Owner is very nice and gives you free baklava which is amazing"}
{"text":"I can't say it enough that this is THE best Greek around! Not only is the food great but the staff is very friendly. I feel lucky to have this place around the corner!"}
{"text":"I literally can not get enough of this place. My team at work eats here for lunch at least once a week. We order catering from them for events. Their food NEVER fails to please. It's a family owned and run gem. You need to give it a try - it is not optional.   Their weekday lunch specials include a chicken or gyro pita with a side or a salad with chicken or gyro meat. First, their pita is homemade and literally to die for.  The chicken is grilled to perfection and tender and juicy and the marinade/seasoning is heavenly!  The gyro meat is also incredible. I always get the Greek side salad because their homemade vinegarette is so good I crave it. But their other sides are spectacular as well.  Their pizzas (the dough is the pita bread dough) are all amazing as well. I haven't ventured any further on the menu because I love what I get so much but I keep promising I will venture further with other selections.  George is the chef and owner and is usually there. He's great. His wife and kids take orders and deliver the food. They are all welcoming and fun.   There is a counter by the drinks where there is usually a selection of \"free\" items to try. Usually pizza bread (slices of homemade crusty bread with tomato sauce, cheese and sausage or pepperoni), bread slices, and homemade baklava. Yesterday there was a spinachy garlicky and cheese \"pie\" that was incredible and I should have asked what it was called. George brought us over some thick potato slices to try. They were roasted with maybe lemon and garlic and were so good!    Bottom line is this is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Fresh, homemade food, made with a lot of love. And you will go back after you come once. I promise."}
{"text":"George's Kitchen is a hidden gem. If you are familiar with and loved Crazy Jims (especially their pita bread and dressing), then you will love George's Kitchen because it is the former owner. Their food is very fresh, reasonably priced for the quality of it, and tastes like authentic Greek cuisine. I usually get the Greek salad which comes with the pita and amazing dressing and my husband will get a gyro. Never a disappointment. They also give freshly baked baklava free of charge at the end of your meal. It's very busy during lunch time, less busy during dinner. Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Great place awesome food  So fresh and the deep dish pizza omg  Everything I've had here has been excellent"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!  The food is amazing.  I will be visiting this restaurant more often now that I have discovered it."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto George's Kitchen today while in the area.  I walked in and saw familiar faces from one of my favorite places in downtown...Crazy Jim's. The familiar faces were the original owners. I was ecstatic, since their menu and five-star flavor cannot be topped by any other Greek restaurant that I've eaten at.   This family operated restaurant has class and a great Malbec.  Not only did I eat lunch here today...I even came back for dinner. I'm happy to see that the Deligiannis family is only 12min from my home with George's Kitchen. I'll be back with crowds of people very soon."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with chicken and a pizza. Both were just average. The place was clean and the service was fast and professional. I think it is a little pricey, especially since the flavor of the food was just OK. If I am going to pay $15 for a salad it needs to be delicious. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really great service, really good food! Salads were cold and pita was yummy. But oh my, the feta cheese tomato fries were the best! I'm a tough critic I know and only gave 4 stars because the pita bread was a little too thick and quite tough. Great place to chill and we loved sitting outside!"}
{"text":"This is one the best Greek restaurants in Phoenix. I stopped by for the first time today and was delighted with an organic Greek salad. The best feta cheese. I'm coming back for dinner. When the owner pays attention to things like French brewed tea and great baklava, it means this is a find."}
{"text":"This is a great \"go to\" spot for all things Mediterranean, great food, just go!    (Apparently \"someone\" thinks one sentence isn't enough for a full review....so...)"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch, good for kids, and service is pretty fast. Their pita is served warm and it's nice and soft and chewy. My mom ordered the gyro pita with a side of the lemon chicken soup. The gyro meat was soft and very flavorful, just a little spicy. The soup was also good. My sister ordered the chicken feta salad, which she liked. I ordered the saganaki salad with chicken. My salad and my sister's salad looked exactly alike, except hers had feta and mine had saganaki cheese. Not exactly sure what saganaki is supposed to be like, this one was warm and chewy, slightly crispy on the outside, kind of like a fried mozzarella stick that's cooled down a bit so it's more chewy than stringy. It's a touch pricey for what you get, but the food is pretty good. Would come back again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Exceptional service from the gentleman at the counter. Greek salad was easily one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. Pita was fresh, and lightly grilled perfectly. Prices are fair, food is amazing. Five stars no prob, I may review them twice so I can give them 10 Stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food. Excellent Service. Best Greek food in the Valley."}
{"text":"Love this place. Eat there at least once a week. Great family run restaurant. Try the Fish & Chips special on Friday's!"}
{"text":"Decieded to stop in for lunch one day as I heard it was owned by the old owners of Crazy Jim's and I loved CJ's! Well, it certainly did not dissapoint! I had the lunch special of a Gryo, fries and a drink. Portions are quite big so you could even share it. Service was great and everythign was super clean. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just finished our salads. This is our favorite takeout salad spot in the area. They are so yummy! I always get the goat cheese salad with steak added to the top. The dressing is my favorite dressing I have ever had. I'm serious. I like it so much, sometimes I buy a jar of it to use at home for my own salads. Each salad is served with warm, fluffy, delicious pita in which I use half of the dressing on my salad, and use the other half as dip for my pita. I love the mixed lettuce they use, a lot of variety. I like that they put chick peas on the top of the salad, I love the kalamata olives as well. My husband always gets the jalape√±o salad, he likes spicy, and is always satisfied. He switches up the protein between gyro meat and steak, tonight he did steak. The indoor is a good size, there is good parking, it's very clean, and the service is always very friendly. I actually usually have a smile on my face when on the phone ordering the takeout, because the guy I usually talk to, makes it a point to use my name after I give it to him. It's the little things, and this place does a lot of little things right!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Fantastic Greek salad and gyros. Will for sure be back and the staff is SO friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is owned by the people who formerly owned Crazy Jim's!  The Greek salad was delicious. The gyro was tasty. The pizza that was part of the Chris' Dinner special was super tasty with pepperoni, feta, and fresh tomato. The only thing that needs work is the french fries which were soggy and full of oil. I absolutely recommend this place. I will be back for a salad in the future!"}
{"text":"Ordered some take out for dinner. We got the Mega gyro, spanakopita, seafood platter, salmon and shrimp, and hummus. It was all delicious. The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. The mega gyro is truly huge and can feed one ravenous person or two pretty hungry people. Their fries are delicious too, crisp and a perfect ratio of soft inner potato and outer crisp shell. They aren't thicker cut home fries, but more traditional, not quite as thin as McDonalds. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place four stars just because of the awkward dude at the counter. Not sure who he was but he made us very uncomfortable. The food is just too good to knock a star off for his weird ass. Very fresh and well cooked food. Highly recommend the chicken kebabs and gyro."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch this weekend. The jalapeno pita was very good. Gyro meat is very good here. The white pizza was good, but nothing to write home about. Next time, we will try a different pizza."}
{"text":"1st visit here. Great food. Very fresh. Very friendly staff. Cool setup. My Steak pita & my wife's Greek salad were really good. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Love George's kitchen.  Always delicious!  Super friendly and relaxing, and a nice place to enjoy good food."}
{"text":"The pizza here at George's kitchen is a blend of east coast meets Midwest pizza. New York and Chicago combined together and you get this delicious pizza here at George's. I highly suggest the trip be made for the pizza! Portioned just right and tastes delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent. Got one of the lunch specials today - the gyro salad - and they make it fresh. Full of crisp veggies, olives, egg, tomato, garbanzo beans, feta cheese and topped with gyro meat. The salad dressing was yummy and they give a lot which I actually used all of it. It was that good.  The restaurant is very clean and updated."}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order so I can't give you feedback on service and ambiance. I ordered the hummus with pita bread and gyro pita with fries.   Luckily the order was enough for me and my husband, which was good. The hummus was ok - it was a little runny for me. The gyro pita wasn't bad, but the fries were not fresh. They tasted like they've been sitting there for a couple of hours. I did enjoy the pita bread.  Total bill: A little less than $20"}
{"text":"Best place! Good affordable gyros. Super clean local place with great food and good vibes. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Delicious Best salad hands down! Had Jalape√±o Salad add chicken! Ample size and full of everything you could want in a salad! Cute and clean place! Definitely becoming a regular"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and always good.  I have gotten food from here 3 times. Twice was Togo and once dinning in.  Every time I was impressed with portion size and flavor.  Awesome job."}
{"text":"Family ran business and it show in the food and service. Definitely will have to try everything on the menu ."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a five star place. We live nearby and drive by here daily but for whatever reason have always overlooked it. Great food, the best we've had in phx. Fair prices and great service.  We are grabbing a take out menu on the way out and will be back here often."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and great service!  The pitas are made fresh in house and they are AMAZING!  I love the hummus and pizzas too!!  Prices are not bad for what you get.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We come here about once a week.  Our favorite is the Greek salad with chicken.   Other favorites are the hummus and the gyro fries.     Service is fantastic and the baklava samples are amazing.      Looking forward to trying the fish and chips  Friday special sometime soon."}
{"text":"I've checked out most of the Greek food spots Phoenix has to offer, and George's Kitchen is by far uses the freshest ingredients, most flavorful and the best customer service. Super tasty and great quality. Must check out!"}
{"text":"Family-owned, high quality done right.  Every meal will fill you up, every meal will be perfectly cooked and presented. Ive been coming here for a couple of years from when it was newer. The atmosphere is clean and well-kept. Meat is seasoned, juicy and perfectly tender. Vegetables are tender and prepared to maintain nutritional value. Perfect for post workout recovery or just stuffing your face..."}
{"text":"A little bit pricy but the food was amazing. Great restaurant for dinner out with friends and a have conversation."}
{"text":"Great food!  Love to come here and order Chicken Feta Salad on the lunch menu. The staff that takes orders are a bit odd. They don't seem Very happy."}
{"text":"Had the Greek salad and White pizza, added sausage...yum!  Big salad with warm pita bread.  They are not stingy with their toppings and ingredients.  Pizza was super good too.  Parking was available but not too many spots.  Price was really good for the amount of food.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Best restaurant! Everything is Absolutely delicious & the service is wonderful!! We are only disappointed that we don't live in Phoenix because this would be a regular dinner place."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I had the gyro pita and the pita was fantastic!  The side salad was very good and the house dressing was excellent!  My daughter lover her Caesar salad.  The service was extremely good -  above and beyond our expectations.  If you get the chance, I would definitely try George's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Phoenix. By far. Take out is always super quick, and the food is fresh, hot, and reliably delicious. We love the gyro pita with fries and goat cheese salad with added gyro meat. And baklava."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I come all the time. Healthy delicious options and the baklava is amazing. The gyro meat is also delicious. I always bring my family here when they visit."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so I thought I'd give this place a shot and it is legit my friends. The restaurant was very clean and the guy up front was very helpful and guided us thru menu questions with ease. I'm not the biggest gyro guy but theirs was the best I've had and my girlfriend really enjoyed her salad. If you itching for Greek give this place a peek lol."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for lunch with a friend. We had the Chicken Feta Salad lunch special. The portion size was plenty and the ingredients were fresh. The food is made and presented with care even for delivery orders. We will definitely try more things on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Great food, little pricy, but still one of our new favs! Try the pitas, especially the jalape√±o pita or Jim's Pita. Pizzas are descent, but quite small for the price. The lemon orzo soup is the perfect side dish."}
{"text":"Great food and consistently fresh ingredients! Very friendly service always from this family owned business. Excellent homemade baclava and pizzas."}
{"text":"work cafeteria is closed for remodel so i was frantically looking for lunch spots this week. meep!  george's is a short drive away and has excellent reviews, and my team loves greek food, so this was a no brainer.  pretty spacious restaurant and the place was humming at lunchtime on a monday - always a good sign :) the menu is pretty big but revolves around the standard greek protein choices - i got a gyro pita (extra gyro), subbed the fries with a side salad, and a soda - $16 or so.  they give you a number and your food will arrive in no time.  the platter is huge - and i finished it all (except for half the pita).  the gyro meat is nicely flavored and seared, the cucumber sauce is a great complement, and the salad not overly dressed. i'd come back to eat here again for sure. they were also handling out baklava samples which my team partook in.  service was a little rushed and unattentive, but i guess it was lunch rush..."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Salad was fresh, plenty of chicken and wonderful dressing. Pita hot and fresh. Nice Greek wine and h"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! If you have not tried it out you need to come! George and his lovely wife Ellen  make the place so comfortable.  Try the Alfredo with salmon or their new pizza \"gig and goat!\"  Unbelievable!!  Great for client lunches or family dinners! Try it out!"}
{"text":"My favorite greek food is a gyro, so that is what I got. Delicious! The pita is quite tasty and the meat delicious. Tzatziki was good and I got the lemon chicken rice soup to go with it. Service was friendly and food came out super fast. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I came here for our lunch hour after I discovered their yelp page. The lady at the front greeted us. Everything sounded good, so we didn't know what to order right away. She was really sweet and offered practically a whole slice of pizza to my fianc√© to sample (which was good btw!) We ended up ordering two salads because we didn't want to go back to work too full. The portions were perfect!  We will be back again."}
{"text":"There is really nothing special about George's Kitchen.  Every dish seems like a copy of every chain restaurant.  Food below average. Service gets one start. We were pretty much ignored even when they were not busy.  I really don't understand the good reviews. I guess my standards of a good restaurant are high.  This place wont last.  Plus, I really don't like restaurants that are not fancy but you still feel like you need to dress up to go there,  That's how I felt."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Greek salad is the best I've ever had. The feta and house made vinaigrette just take this salad to a whole new level. They make their own pitas and they come warm and so good! Everyone there is so nice and friendly, the prices are very reasonable for the quality, and it's clean and so cute inside. Also, a nice little patio. My boyfriend and I have been there 3 times and they already remember us! Definitely a must if you want delicious quality food with a quaint neighborhood feel!"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek restaurants we've ever tried. My husband and I found this one on yelp and we're Greek starved patrons. From California on our way to visit in Phoenix. Lemon chicken soup was perfect and my husbands's gyro salad was great. We only wished we're could have eaten more at the time.  The sample of baklava was incredibly good especially since I usually do not like it.  Definitely a place we'll come back to"}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of George's kitchen. Excellent food that never disappoints. Not only do they have phenomenal Greek food, but arguably one of the best Pizzas I've had. Jim is masterful in the kitchen and cares about his product, always using quality ingredients and a strictly hand made policy. To top it off they have a great selection of beer and wine! A true family owned business that takes care of their customers. We need more places like George's in the valley."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, especially the goat cheese chicken salad. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"We ordered soup, salad, Georgie's pizza, beer/wine and baklava. Everything we ordered was delicious! Very nice staff too."}
{"text":"Wonderful family owned restaurant with yummy, authentic Greek food. Salads are fresh, crisp and tossed with the right amount of dressing. I've had the village salad with chicken souvlaki and the greek salad and lemon rice soup-so delicious! They pour a generous glass of wine for a decent price-so appreciated. I love the vibe in the place, welcoming, on trend but not pretentious or overly done. The family members work well together and speak kindly to each other-it's obvious they love what they have created. My only complaint is that it is a bit on the expensive side-my lunch of soup, salad & drink (no alcohol or dessert) was $19."}
{"text":"I had the Greek Platter which was fries, spanakopita, gyro and a fillo dough triangle stuffed with cheese.  All were good.  Ambiance is clean and minimal."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and this place hit the spot. It's in a shopping center that is hidden. But they have great food especially pizza and the hummus. I got the gyro pita and my husband got a chicken pizza. For an appetizer we split the hummus which was super yummy! The only thing I would say that needs work is the pasta salad because for my taste, it had too much sun dried tomatoes and the pasta needed to be cooked just a bit more. Other than that, if we are ever in the area, we will be sure to stop. My husband and I are all about supporting local restaurants and this one hit the spot!   Also a little tip, you can bring doggies on the patio and they will even give you a water bowl for them. In the heat of Arizona, this is a must!  Especially if you're camping and don't have a place to leave the puppies!"}
{"text":"Excellent family owned Greek style eatery. The family is engaged in every aspect of the business and a family member is always there. Food is super tasty and healthy as well."}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewers - this place rocks. Have been checking out local gyro places for quick after work bites and this one definitely wins.  High quality food, well presented, nice space, also good for solo eating and the wine/beer option is nice. Good combo options. Recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to George's a couple times now, went again today for lunch. It's a nice little place near my office so I don't know why I don't remember to eat here more often. It could be because it's not overwhelming amazing. It's a really nice, decent, place for lunch. The prices aren't crazy, the serving size is great, just enough to cover lunch and not have leftovers or still be hungry. The gyro is cooked nicely, tender and not dry, can be salty but that's to be expected.  The only thing that isn't spectacular is how loud it gets inside. They have an open space with cement flooring so you will have to yell to communicate with the others at your table, and in turn the people next to you will have to yell, etc etc. There's 3 tables outside and when the weather is lovely try and snag them, you'll be able to hear yourself think better outside."}
{"text":"I picked up takeout from Georges Kitchen yesterday and was totally impressed! The inside of the restaurant is casual but cool and I would definitely come back to eat in.  But yesterday I did take out. The gyro was tender and juicy, and the small salad that came with it was fresh and the dressing was a perfect combination of creamy and acidic. I love that they deliver and will definitely be trying them again.  Update:  this is awesome customer service so I'll mention that I was picking up take out a few weeks ago and a customer sitting down started to choke. An employee ran over and gave her the Heimlich maneuver and saved her. It was a beautiful moment at Georges Kitchen."}
{"text":"We have only done take out. Their take out is super speedy and their gyros are DELICIOUS!  Only slightly overshadowed by the baklava which is heavenly."}
{"text":"Amazing is all I can say! Had the Gyro Feta Salad with a glass of wine. Yum! I'm doing a happy dance lol."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a new neighborhood restaurant opening up. This place really is a hit or miss. The first time I got the chicken pita the chicken was dry but otherwise ok. The french fries were ok. Second visit I got a salad and it was delicious. Third time I got spanakopita it was hot on the outside and cold on the inside. When I let the guy working know he offered to reheat it as opposed to taking it off my bill or replacing it. I also ordered the steak pita and was seriously underwhelmed. Not sure if I'll be back since I expect great food every time especially at their prices."}
{"text":"I've been for lunch, dinner and we've hired them to cater lunch for a meeting at my office and they serve delicious and high quality food every time.    The menu is Greco-American but not just gyros and fries. The salads are excellent- those with greens are ample and fresh and the pasta salad is incredible. The pasta salad is penne with a tangy dressing, with spring peas, feta and sun dried tomatoes. That combo really works- the peas are sweet to offset the bite of the tangy dressing and salty feta. A restaurant that pulls together a pasta salad with that much care for flavor, you know they do their grilled fare, pitas, sandwiches and pizzas right.   The pita is overflowing with chicken, gyro meat, steak- your choice- tomatoes and zesty red onions and the pita itself is so good, you'll want an extra one to dip into the house made tzatziki sauce.   Prices are not cheap, not gonna lie, but you do get what you pay for- great food, ample portions, in a clean, modern establishment staffed by a local family. It's a great lunch or dinner if you're counting calories because of all the healthy options. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"Saw this place on 16th street, have been wanting to try it for some time.  I walked in on a Tuesday night, it was rather quiet.  I noticed a young girl texting on her phone when I walked in, I was surprised that she didn't see me walking in waiting to greet me.  I walk up to the counter and she gets off of the beer boxes she was sitting on, only then does she greet me.  Ay, kids!  Anyway, I ordered the Chicken pita sandwich with a salad.  I will say that the pita bread was SO GOOD!  The chicken was grilled, just a little dry, but otherwise good.  The vibe is cool and clean.  Im surprised it didn't have more people.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I had th steak gyro with fries. You could tell the cook the steak fresh. Juicy, soft , and good! My lady had Greek salad with chicken. It was filled with all types of vegetables . Very flavorful and filling. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I ordered the goat cheese salad and added salmon (to-go lunch). It came with a nice fresh warm piece of pita. This was hands-down the best Greek salad I've ever had. Everything was super fresh.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best calamari I've had in the valley, and the pizza's great too.  I'm surprised they don't have more people in there, but it is not a reflection on the food.  There is a reason they have stich a high score. Try them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is excellent...especially the gyro. Restaurant is clean and I find the staff very welcoming. It is a little pricey, but the portions are quite large. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is another place that wasn't what I expected it to be. I was thinking this place was a sit down restaurant, but it is actually a counter service kind of place. The place is cute, but somewhat plain in decoration. For food, I tried the salad with the special greek cheese (not feta, something else I hadn't heard of before) and the George pizza with sun dried tomatoes, chicken, garlic, and various other toppings. The salad was very tasty, I enjoyed the creamy dressing and felt that the veggies were fresh. The cheese was tasty and the portion was large. The pizza was just ok... again, the portion was generous, but the flavor was nothing terribly special. I would like to come back to try the chicken pita in the future."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and the food is always good.  Don't really care for their style of pizza, but the pita is the best in Phoenix.  Wish they sold it to-go."}
{"text":"A wonderful place run by the son and daughter of Crazy Jim."}
{"text":"I ordered Jim's chicken pita with a side Caesar salad. It was a to-go order that was picked up from some co-workers. The pita was still hot when it arrived. The first bite was amazing, the chicken was cooked perfectly! Probably the best Pita I have ever had. The side Caesar was also VERY good. The dressing came on the side and the greens and Parmesan cheese were fresh. I just finished lunch and I can not wait to go back! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, the quality and freshness of the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Met our daughter for dinner Friday night to try the new restaurant in the neighborhood. My husband and I both loved the chicken pita and our daughter thought the gyro was delicious. Highly recommended that everyone in North Central Phoenix visit this clever new restaraunt."}
{"text":"Best Greek salad I've had in Phoenix... delicious Greek coffee... yummy, complimentary baklava samples... absolutely a new favorite/go-to spot when I don't want to cook!!"}
{"text":"Again, THE BEST,  I am a food junkie....so let me tell you of all the Greek restaurants in Phoenix, George's Kitchen is one of the best. I usually have it delivered & it is super fast. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Totally shocked by all the great reviews.  My husband and I both thought it tasted like cafeteria food.  After our first few bites of pizza, we  decided to text each other at the same time what it reminded us of.   I sent that it reminded me if Totinos frozen pizza and my husband thought it tasted like Digiorno pizza.  We had a laugh. The cheese app tasted like soap or rubbing alcohol and the pita was nothing fabulous.   We love all of the new restaurant popping up!  Not this one."}
{"text":"Happy to be the first one to write a review. Another wonderful addition to the 16th Street Neighborhood. Service is super friendly in the food is wonderful. Come support the local businesses in the area. A perfect restaurant to bring the whole family. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way to George's after driving by it and not knowing what it was for months!  Had to go standard and try the gyro and fries as my first adventure here and it was fantastic! So happy to have a good local greek/mediterranean place!! Now if they were just on UberEATS i'd be much happier and order it more often!!! ;)"}
