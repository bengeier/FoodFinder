{"text":"They have a wonderful chicken salad sandwich and my husband really likes their Southern chicken sandwich - which is fried chicken with provolone and bacon.  We really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Anna was helpful and made some great recommendations. The Food is always very good and at Reasonable price. If you are in the mood, I recommend trying the Greek Coffee"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed what I've ordered. I've been here at least 4 times, and each and every time the food as been good, and the service great.  Love that they're always neat, clean, and have a great health grade!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the owner, but the young men in the kitchen need a lesson on how to treat customers who stand and wait to have their orders taken."}
{"text":"Might be my new favorite place close to home. Had the fried zucchini & grape leaves for appetizers. Both were awesome. Had the gyro sandwich and it was also great! Real small, family place. Great hidden gem. I'll be back, quite often."}
{"text":"It is a muted version of Greek cuisine - the salad dressing, for one, is in need of a do-over. It hardly differs from the salad I could get from a pizzeria chain. Their vegetables, on the other hand are very good. Grilled zucchini and broccoli with scampi sauce are fresh and flavorful. The spanakopita is no bad either, but the pastry comes soggy bc they heated it up in the microwave. Moving on to the souvlaki and chicken tips - these need a lot of work. Drop the parboiled rice and put more zest and power into the seasoning. Otherwise, the quality remains to only satisfy those who do not know better."}
{"text":"Took the in-laws here while they were visiting and they agreed it was some of the best food they had had. One member of our group had the Gorgonzola salad- huge portion size but he finished all of it because it was so good. The spanakopita is excellent as are the gyros. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"The gyro plate was perfect and I swapped the fries for grilled zucchini. Added some baklava and the spot was definitely hit."}
{"text":"Good home style Greek food. The gyro meat is sliced fresh and fried a little crispy. The buffalo chicken wrap is really good too. It's grilled, which is not the norm. Fresh crispy onion rings cooked perfectly. Shoestring French fries are a hit with my better half. They have one of the better Greek salads around."}
{"text":"We've been here a total of 4 times so far, The waiter is very kind and is quick to answer any questions and gets your order in quick. Food is ALWAYS so so fresh and beautifully cooked to perfection. I've had the gyro and the lamp plate, love lamb, and this place by far has one of the best tasting lamb plates. Convenient location and has a cozy diner-type vibe."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been here 3 times and the food is freshly made and hot every time.  The gyro pita was great (as good as Showmars if not better) and the soups are really good.  I wish this place had a better location (nothing else in the area) and was closer to Indian Trail.  I'll continue to stop here for lunch (I work out of a service van) but I'm never way down Monroe Rd. when its lunchtime so its hard to get there when open and 8:30pm is way too early to close at night....I don't even eat dinner until like 9pm most nights."}
