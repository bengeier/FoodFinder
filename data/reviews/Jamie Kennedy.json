{"text":"The Gardiner museum is a wonderful place to visit so please go.  The staff and exhibits here are top notch.  Don't waste your time or money at Jamie Kennedy's.  We have always wanted to visit a JK's restaurant and thought our trip to the Gardiner was a perfect chance.  First off the service was terrible.  Our waiter was in a rush to close early and did everything in his power to put us off in the process.  We ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich and lentil soup both vegetarian.  The lentil soup was mediocre with little flavour while the vegetable sandwich was a bland soggy mess.  Jamie, have you ever tasted this food?  Re-think your menu or stick with the French fries."}
{"text":"I went to a friend's wedding here. The location is 5 stars. The patio is brilliant and has a great view. The food was 2 stars. Not my thing. I've heard their brunch is pretty good. Maybe I'll need to go back on a non wedding event day to give them another chance"}
{"text":"It was ok. The food was acceptable but not extraordinary, the price too high for what it is and the service was more attitude than what the place can afford, I guess they can get away with it. The company sucked, except for Maria and Jet, they were great and can make any room glow. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Although I have only been here for special events, Jamie Kennedy at the Gardiner excels at what Jamie does best and never disappoints.    Having received the Order of Canada for his promotion and elevation of Canadian local products, tonight's dinner was on in a series of dinners to be held at the Gardiner.  The Museum itself is spectacular and well worth a pre-dinner walk through.  The 3rd floor where the restaurant is a beautiful modern, warm and inviting space.  The night's dinner featured \"Canadian\" cuisine which Jamie described as very difficult to define given Canada's enormous and varied geography and culture.    Canapes included a scrumptuous morsel of tortiere (savoury mince wrapped in a delicate phyllo - delicious stuff!) Digby bay scallop chowder was lovely without the heaviness that usually typifies cream based soups.  Bison two ways (braised and roasted) showcased this tasty meat beautifully.  Delicious roasted bison was tender and juicy without the reliance on the fattiness one would expect from say a prime rib roast; and the braised bits melted off the fork in meaty goodness. Dessert was a 'pouding chomieur\" which seems to be like a bread pudding made with buttery pound cake.  Hearty, but a bit too sweet for my liking.    I've always been a fan of Jamie Kennedy's cooking and this meal did not stray from his usual excellence.    Terrific meal for a wonderful Friday evening.  Can't wait for the next one!  http://www.gardinermuseum.on.ca/events/culinary-series"}
{"text":"Lovely food. I'd definetely recommend it for summerlicious especially if you are looking for combination of price and quality in your summerlicious lunch. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty setting but the food falls flat. More museum cafe with a few fancy tables. You would enjoy the MET in NYC much more. The prices are great and the food is uninspired. Just stop by for coffee and a quick snack, nothing more."}
{"text":"Jonathan W says it all. This is a lovely space; a very open, bright, and clean design. The menu is very small and limited to basic cafe fare: soup, salad, and sandwiches. The food is fairly mediocre and portions are predictably small but, thankfully, the prices are more reasonable than you'd expect from looking at the place.  The yam soup ($6) got things off to a good start -- very good and a little spicy. The fries ($6), served with mayo, were also very good. The vegetarian sandwich ($7) is where things failed. Not bad, just boring and tiny, and those gaufrettes it's served with are just rubbery, oily, insipid potato chips with a fancy name."}
{"text":"Located on the 3rd floor of the Gardiner Museum, this Jamie Kennedy restaurant takes you on an international journey using locally grown ingredients (the menu took us on a journey through Japan)  The atmosphere is lovely - nice and airy with high ceilings and a wonderful view of the ROM and a patio overlooking Avenue Road (which was not in use for our Friday night visit)  While the food wasn't perfect (I had high expectations after recently eating at one of Gordan Ramsey's restaurants in the UK), it was certainly worth the experience. Chef Scott Vivian did a wonderful job and it would be worth another trip back to see what culinary adventure we would embark on."}
