{"text":"What a disappointment. My fianc√© suggested this place because of a plain dealer recommendation. Close to the airport, so we decided to try it out. 

$15.99 dinner special included soup or salad, drink, appetizer and entree. We chose the miso soup. Very plain. Like buffet quality. The beef dumplings taste like frozen dumplings you can buy in Chinatown, The Pad Thai was thick sauce mixed with thin white noodles. Only chicken, no shrimp. The egg was almost nonexistent. We also tried the Thai chicken noodle soup. One word - BLAND. The same chicken they mixed in my pad Thai was the chicken in the soup. Like a cheap imitation of Vietnamese pho. The only thing we enjoyed from the meal was the Thai ice tea. 

Definitely will not be coming back. So sad."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced for the service, quality, and preparation of food. We ordered an eel roll for $7 that only contained a sliver of eel, rice, and seaweed. It was improperly rolled and mushy. The waiter was unable to comprehend that I did not want rice with my curry and would like extra vegetables instead. It took 5 mins just to finally have him agree to a side of vegetables. The food came and both my and my friend's sauce was watery, it was so watery it was like we were eating soup. It didn't even stick to the rice let alone anything else. The eel roll came after we were half way done with our entrees when it was ordered when we ordered everything else. The waiter was rude and inexperienced. Terrible place. Expect to pay top dollar for cheap ingredients prepared poorly."}
{"text":"From the quiet Asian pop-fusion playing over the speakers to the springy sound the floor makes when you walk across it, this place is quaint and understated. But the food is really tasty. While they don't have the best pad thai I've ever had, their dumplings and fried rice dishes are delicious. I go here for lunch often, and they have perfect portions, and great lunch specials. I recommend any of the sushi lunch bento boxes. And, for dinner, you really can't go wrong with any of the noodle dishes, except maybe for said pad thai."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've found in Cleveland. I drive from Lakewood for it. I've loved everything I've tried, but the Massaman curry is my favorite. They also offer brown rice which I prefer. And the lights over the tables are fascinating!"}
{"text":"If you like brown Thai food this is the place for you!
Had carry out from this place after reading  positive reviews was really disappointed with Pad Thai and Pad See Yew.  Both dishes were horrible practically inedible and strangely brown.  I added beef to my Pad Thai which seemed to have the  consistency of beef jerky.  Normally I'm a big beef jerky fan but its not   so good with rice noodles.  My friend had Pad See Yew which he compared to opening a can of Pedigree and dumping it into a cheap Styrofoam container.  He originally said Fancy Feast cat food but after reflection changed to Pedigree.

On the bright side the place looks nice and the staff was friendly and the summer rolls were passable."}
{"text":"My husband and I have  dined here numerous times and have also ordered take out occasionally. The decor is sparse mix of modern with out being cheesy except for the plastic food in the cabinet  when you first walk in the door. I still don't get it? does anyone think that plastic food would make someone look at it and say..MMMm that's what I want for dinner,,yum! OK seriously other than that it's not super chic but it's also open, clean and the lights are cool.

So On to the food our standby's are usually an order of crab angles because I'm a sucker for deep fried and cream cheese anything and these are a little different that most places there more like tiny spring rolls..not a lot of crab flavor but the skin of the wrap is light and tasty. Then my husband almost always gets the Pad Thai, which most times has been excellent but here has been a time or two that it has been dry and tasteless. 

I've order a ton of different stuff. My favorites have been the Mango curry with shrimp or chicken. Really great curry sauce not flat or salty, nicely balanced with big chunks of veggies and the options of brown rice which I prefer. I have also enjoyed the Hot basil, Mixed vegetable with Tofu ( fried) and Garee Goong-Shrimp..which was excellent. As well as the sweet and sour but truthfully I wouldn't order this again because I want my protein to be fried in S&S dishes..I know it's bad for me but it just tastes better that way! 

What I was disappointed with  was the LoMein. It was oily and bland. I also had a bad experience with the Thai coconut soup being way too spicy and it had a curdled look to it.

The sushi is pretty good especially for being in the suburbs of Cleveland. The Playboy roll is probably our favorite but we've tried many and never have been bummed by what we've been served. The Sushi Chef seems to take great pride in his work because the presentation is lovely but not fussy. 

The service can be hit and miss. My experiences overall have been fine. Not much good quality alcohol selections ( beer & wine) but there Martini list is decent and I liked the Lychee Nut Martini and a good price 8$."}
{"text":"I would love to give five stars because the quality of the food deserves it, it's usually very delicious. The reason I can't give five stars is because the consistency is off. I almost always order the teriyaki chicken and it's never really made the same from visit to visit. They used to change their daily soup they serve with lunch and had the best egg drop soup I've ever had as one of them, now they only serve the basic miso soup that every restaurant has. The wait staff is also different on every visit I'm not sure what's going on with their turnovers and management. Because of the lack of consistency and blandness of their daily soup I don't eat here very often anymore."}
{"text":"Good ambience, very friendly staff, amazing food and kid friendly to boot. Spice levels were a tad bit high (guess you get what you ask for).

Vegetarian friendly. Good selection of Asian beers."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm more disappointed than the last time. The spring rolls tasted like they got them at Costco. We walked out after this. Not going to have dinner here tonight. I will eat canned ravioli art home. The minute we walked through the door we smelled mildew. We should Have turned around at that point. The two beers and spring rolls cost $13.00. I will never come back"}
{"text":"Very good, great thai place in the area. Decent prices and portions. Staff is friendly and service oriented."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and order take-out sushi from here all the time!  The prices are very reasonable too.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty bland.  Fine for lunch, but not somewhere I'd try to impress a date at (at least a first date).

Other reviewers have said this, but the staff can bit a bit awkward.  I ordered a rum and coke once when dining in.  After a few minutes the server came back and rattled off the kinds of rum they have, unsure sure of which one I wanted.

Overall, pretty solid place for what it is.  Would highly recommend for lunch, take-out, or a low-key dinner if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry with veggies. It was delicious. My friend tried something with Mr. Crab in the title. Yikes. But she said it was good. 

The service was fast and the waitress was great and even offered to split our check without us asking. She also refilled our drinks like a champ."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner after reading all the good reviews. Read the most recent reviews that the restaurant has just changed management, affecting their ratings a little. But I figured I would give it a chance. My spouse and I left disappointed and sore in our pockets. Will start with the bad.

- Half price sushi rolls on weeknights. We ordered the spider roll and salmon maki roll. When the rolls came, we were appalled by the size of the salmon maki. They were ridiculously small, a little bigger than 1/2 inch. The salmon were literally the size of boogers. Way off the mark from the standard size. Half price was $2.50. It was worth only a dollar in my opinion. The spider roll's ingredients supposed to consist of soft shell crab, avocado, some kind of small fried fish and cucumber. Size was ok, but ingredients were so miniscule and mashed up we didn't taste anything. Soft shell crab was just tiny battered shells, with the meatless tails sticking out on the 2 ends of the roll. Again, not worth even the half price. Should have sent back at least the salmon roll to let them know that what they were doing was unscrupulous. Advertising half off deals like that, and cheating on quantity. But we had to rush for a concert, so we didn't pursue it.  

The not-so-bad
- Ordered the early bird special sets too. Pricing for this was reasonable. Good size portions. Shrimps were huge. But was hoping for authentic Thai food but we got typical American influenced fair. Food was overly sweet. Summer rolls were nothing to rave about, with tiny bits of chicken and overload of vege. The crispy tofu appetizer was good. Pad Thai was good. 

The good
The saving grace of this place was the speedy and friendly service. True Thai hospitality and smile.

Paid $46 including tips for this meal, which we found grossly expensive, coz of the terrible sushi rolls. Could have gone to our regular Chinese restaurant and ordered lots of dishes and fed the whole family of 4 adults, 2 kids for that price."}
{"text":"I got take-out. We were pregaming for the movie \"Funny People\" at Grouchos next door. My friends once spotted a woman with 2 hooks at Grouchos, so it has become the place to go before seeing a movie. The sort of place where you spot a woman using one of her hooks to smoke is not the sort of place you want to dine. I got take-out from Thai Origin. I ordered the red curry and chicken. It was very tastey, but in retrospect, thai curry is not the sort of thing you want to sneak into a movie. Perhaps I should have asked for a spork, rather than the chopsticks. I did make it out of the movie without spilling so I must be getting better at chopsticks."}
{"text":"I went for lunch May 26, 2013. There was a sushi chef working the entire dining room (host, waiter, bus boy, sushi chef) and a woman in the kitchen who occasionally came out. No waiters. We waited for everything. Other people never got water refills. I ordered pad thai for $9.95. It was the worst I ever had. It had tiny little shrimp, not much else in it but noodles and was sickening sweet though I ordered extra spicy. The shu mai dumplings were cheap frozen from an Asian grocery with no shrimp. They were a cheap whitefish filling and the texture was like snot. They tasted fishy. Disgusting. My bill was over $30 for water, pad thai and an appetizer. On my bill, they charged me $12.95 for the JUMBO shrimp pad thai. I was wondering where the chicken was as I ate it. What a rip off. Don't waste your money. I have eaten Thai all over. This cannot touch Siam Cafe. But, I have found Americans will eat anything."}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this place already because I LOVED it the first time.

Early Bird Special (4:30 - 6:30) = drink (thai iced tea, beer, wine, soda, etc) + soup or salad (miso, chicken, peanut salad, seaweed salad, etc) + appetizer (crispy tofu, edamame, shumai, and on and on) + dinner (sushi or curry or thai) for $14.95!!!!

I orderd the miso, thai iced tea, edamame, and green garden tofu. I took half of it home and split the edamame with my friend. Lots of food! 
My pal ordered the mango curry which smelled amazing.

You can sit at the sushi bar if you like or at a table or booth. 
Friendly service. Great food. Excellent prices. Clean."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. I'm a flight attendant staying in a nearby hotel. I logged into yelp and left the line in Chipoltle to come here. My Pad Thai was tasty."}
{"text":"So disappointed. We live on the east side and ventured here a while back. Our first visit was awesome. Great food and service. Looks like things have declined significantly in a short amount of time. We ordered lobster pad Thai which was way over cooked and the noodles were burnt and crunchy. We had also ordered sushi, but the sushi bar was so backed up we ended up just canceling the order since it would have taken so long to get it. It wasn't crowded, but the servers were understaffed and not able to provide good service at all.  Really hoping that this was just an off night and not their new normal."}
{"text":"Last Sunday, we went to the car show.... We wanted to find somewhere different to try and close by, so we decided to try Thai Origin based upon it's positive reviews.  We were promptly seated by a gentleman who appeared very overwhelmed. He came over approximately 10 minutes after we arrived to take drink orders. We explained that we were ready to place our food order as well.  In the meanwhile, he was running around, though seemed to be having a difficult time managing the 4 tables full of people in the restaurant on his own. He ignored people sitting in the front waiting for takeout as well, which lead to their frustration.  After being there for 30 minutes total, he brought out my sister-in-law's soup (which she ordered as a dinner) and my brother's appetizer of spring rolls.  Still, we never received our drinks. After another 5 minutes went by, we asked him if we could possibly have our drinks.  Another 10 minutes goes by, he brings our drinks, and states, \"I have no idea when your food will be ready\".  He would fluctuate between being very kind and soft spoken to throwing his hands in the air in frustration and grunting.  After an hour of waiting, I asked, \"do you think the food will be out soon?\", he said \"I don't know\" and threw his hands in the air again.  We asked for the check for the food we had already received. He handed us the check and said, \"Thank you for coming tonight\". Which seemed like an odd response based upon the situation.  The waiter did apologize twice; however, the would follow it up a moment later later by becoming very agitated. Very odd behavior, and I can only hope this was an isolated incident.  As a side note, my sister in law did love her soup, but unfortunately, the rest of us never had an opportunity to try their food."}
{"text":"My husband and I lived in Hollywood for 3 years right in the heart of Thai Town, so after moving back to Cleveland we have been missing our Thai fix. We went to Thai origin this evening and I must say that the panang curry was on par with our favorites back in Hollywood. I also loved that I was able to get a spicy tuna roll as an appetizer to quench my craving for sushi as well. This will be a new regular for me."}
{"text":"Wow!  Didn't expect this kind of quality in this area.  Great atmosphere,  staff and food.  Will definately come back again."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience, though I agree here several months ago I remember it quite well. I ordered a bent box which came with a full sushi roll, sashimi, and chicken pad thai. It was delicious and totally affordable. Will eat here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I got take out from Thai Origin. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai. The shrimp was tough and smelled really fishy. I didn't eat it, I was afraid it was bad. The noodles were a mushy tasteless lump. There were a few bean sprouts and egg bits thrown in. I would definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"The presentation/plating of the food is excellent.  The sushi is fresh. You really wouldn't expect this from a place inside a strip plaza in a suburb. Sort of an odd place for such fresh food. Specifically, the jumbo shrimp could have been the best I've ever tested. The prices are about average from what I've seen from different sushi places, except for a few spots downtown. 

The ambiance/decor is a nice surprise, again because of the location. Its dimly lit, enough for a romantic dinner, but there were one or two families eating as well. Service was above average, food was served quickly. Its quiet in here! I love it. 

The only negative is that some of the dishes seem a small notch above the better takeout places in the area, but with a heftier price tag. If you're looking for a quick, simple meal that could be had quicker (and cheaper) than going in for a sit-down meal, you'd probably be better off going that route. This place isn't really worth patronizing for if you're getting something simple that is fairly common. 

This place probably wouldn't be worth a drive across town, but I'd highly recommend it for anyone on the West side of Cleveland. Great, fresh ingredients at fair prices."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently when my flight back to NY was canelled and I was stranded at the airport. 10 minutes away, and excellent, authentic Thai food. Service was excellent too, although the restaurant was empty at 8:30, so it may not be a fair test. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here by accident.waitress seated us quickly..was a little confused about get menu and was a little haphazard.salad came ice cooks with a nice orange light dressing. Miso soup came in a large bowl with a saucer that was to small"}
{"text":"My experience with Thai Origin is mostly around their Sushi.  For the size of this place, they have a very lengthy variety on their sushi menu - sushi, sashimi, big rolls, small rolls.  They even have lunch specials on Sushi.  Unlike many other sushi eateries including the upscale kind, Thai Origin values presentation of Sushi (check out some of the pics on their Sushi presentation).  Even when you to carry out sushi its never just thrown into a white styrofoam box.  I always really appreciate  the Sushi master's care around presentation of these fresh, great tasting nibblers.

I recently had their Chicken Coconut thai soup, which I found a tad bit light on the chicken and heavy on creamy coconut broth.  Their various Thai style fried rice are great, especially the Hot Basil yummm.   

I completely agree with Cara's review (check out the list of reviews for her's) on the ambiance and location of Thai Origin.  I feel that the wait staff try very hard to impress you and accommodate you and as a result sometimes they come off a bit fake, but after several visit you realize that result is completely un-intentional.  They are always very helpful in explaining how their dishes are prepared and they give you the choice on where you sit - the quieter booths to the side or the brightly lit open tables for lively conversations.

Prices range from $5 - $12"}
{"text":"We went here last week after seeing a movie at the Regal cinemas in the same shopping center.  The menu is pages long with lots of selections.  We ordered way too much food and got things we didn't order, but over all it was good.
I always order shrimp rolls when they are on the menu.  My order was very fresh and I liked the shredded lettuce- wish it was served with the traditional peanut sauce though instead of a vinaigrette.  I have a coupon and plan to return in the future to try the sushi."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I only get one thing from Thai Origin. It's usually for lunch and it's take-out too. I don't know if that gives me the right to review this place, but I will anyways. 

Thai Origin is a little sneaker-pick place in a strip mall located in Middleburg Hts. Yeah...not really a super classy joint, but still nice. You walk in and the minimal/slightly cheesy decor almost makes you run away.  Then you realize that almost every Asian restaurant is located in a mall, and they're usually awesome. Eh - why not give it a try? 

Well, I definitely recommend it if you're in the area and have a craving for Thai food. I wouldn't make a trip out to Middleburg Hts to eat here, although it's certainly one of the best choices for Asian cuisine in the area. I always order the Thai Noodle Soup with veggies (extra spicy) to-go and I've never been disappointed. In fact, I crave it on a weekly basis. Then again, if it involves soup, I'm always pleased.  My food is always fresh, tasty and perfectly spicy. I've never heard anyone I know who's eaten there complain about it either. They must be doing something right! 

In my experiences the service has always been awkward, but friendly. They're also super accommodating to whatever modifications you'd like to make to your dish. In my case, they'll make my soup really spicy and even throw in an extra side of their special hot sauce for me, just in case. Those little details go a long way with me! 

So hey, if you find yourself in the Berea/ Brook Park/ Parma /Middleburg Hts area and you're jonesin' for some Thai, try this place. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Part of me wants to give Thai Orgin one star, the other half wants me to give it three stars. I'm conflicted so I'll throw up Tres Hombres because I'm in a decent mood. 

I rolled thru with a party of four on a super dead Sunday night, and there was only one belligerently drunk crew of redneck/Jersey Shore rejects who were super abrasive. 

Upon entering we noticed there was absolutely no music what-so-ever. This was a blessing and a curse. a 60 hz ground loop drone coming from the cooler was kind of amazing. Sort of a weird droning sound and nothing else can be kind of cool. On the other hand, you could hear the Brookpark Road android couple behind us discussing current events and cigarette prices at Sheetz, and the aforementioned Jersey Shore assholes every word. That sucked, as they were loud as hell and only realized when they stood up to leave that \"we're being so obnoxious\". Yeah, no shit - behave yourself you spambot. Ugh!

The decor is nice, it has those cool looking ikea light fixtures that are a total pain in the ass to assemble, so kudos to them for somehow putting like 40 of them together. It's also got a nice solid wood floor. Gotta love a nice floor under your feet. 

Anyway, it kind of took forever for our server to even bring us water. I wasn't that thirsty but if I came through trying to get hydrated in a hurry I would have been in big trouble. Our server was a sweet young woman, who was very nice. She couldn't speak English very well, so there was an interesting language barrier  (read: brick wall) between us that was kind of fun to navigate. There were four of us, and she wouldn't write down anything we ordered. I couldn't tell if she was trying to remember it all because she didn't have a piece of paper, or because she was trying to impress us or what. Maybe her understanding was hindered due to language, but she must have come back like three or four times to confirm the order. It seemed like she had amnesia or something. Pretty abstract.

Anyway, the food all came out at different times. Everybody got their meal kind of \"whenever\". The appetizer I ordered came out last and was priced as an entree. Sounds really confusing and strange right?

It gets more weird - the food ALL tasted the same. Sushi, tempura, basil fried rice - somehow, in some weird way, it all tasted the same. How does that happen?? I ate a piece of my friends avocado sushi roll, and then ate basil fried rice, and then vegetable tempura, and it all tasted the same and had the same texture. It was sensory distortion of the highest order. it's a good thing the food all tasted ok )even if over priced), but jesus christ the whole experience was really non linear and kind of dizzying. For the Middleburg Heights Desolation Plaza, where culture outside of Monster energy drink, Winston Light 100 Soft Packs, and Realtree urban-camo jackets doesn't really thrive, this place is fighting the good fight. 

Three stars for now, but VERY thin ice."}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic food and a very friendly staff.  We had a seafood dish with squid, clams, and shrimp with vegetables and fried rice.  Excellent!

They also have a solid bar including cocktails, beer, and wine.  Was pleasantly surprised they had Great Lakes beer in stock as well as more common American and Asian beers.

Cute atmosphere.  Great casual spot and a pleasant surprise to get such great Thai food in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Very light and tasty crispy spin rolls and amazing Pad Thai! I also enjoyed the sushi"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and it was for takeout, so I can't really comment on much except what I ordered, and that was Pad Thai. It was just simply not good. Noodles were overcooked, and the sauce was bland.

Nope. Would not eat again."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor matched in the presentation of their sushi. Much attention to detail and well-crafted plating.

Their sushi was respectable. Not fantastic, but edible.

I had the boat for two with soup and salad. The peanut dressing was good."}
{"text":"I am pretty much a creature of habit so when I find something that works for me at a particular establishment I rarely stray. For me the pad thai at Thai Origin works and I have been there 20 or so times and that's the only thing I have ever had. I have had pad thai other places and did not like it as much as I like the pad thai here. I have gone with several people and they always seem to like what they have. I would reccomend giving this place tucked away in a strip in Mburg Heights a try."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of most of their food. The pad thai isn't good & the fried rice is bland. The only reason why I come here is because of the sushi. It's the only place in Middleburg Heights to get sushi so, it's convenient."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get take-out. I asked the server if they had anything vegetarian and she replied, \"we can make anything vegetarian or vegan.\" The magic word!! VEGAN! I got a tofu spicy basil dish with rice. While I waited, the sweet staff brought miso soup and water (without me even asking for it). I ate the food in the car (I was ready to get back to Columbus) and it was pretty good. Not as spicy as I would have liked, but I forgot to ask for it to be super spicy (next time). The only other thing was that it was a bit too much oil, I suppose I could ask next time to go light on the oil. Anyway, it was yummy and I'll go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Thai Origin is a great new place (new to me that is).  I am on a pad thai quest, and it is definitely top notch here.  Not slimy or greasy, but very fine sharp refined taste.  Filling yet light.  The sushi tastes amazing and also has a beautiful presentation.  Prices are right . Small intimate setting."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Ohio. Excellent curry and Tom Kha Gai soup"}
{"text":"Late in the evening on a Sunday night-
Me- what do u feel like eating?
Hubby- I don't know, Asian??
Me- yeah ok

Check yelp, for  the closest asian place with decent reviews. Walk walk walk..

Enter into Thai Origin, order sake, veggie maki roll, tom yum soup, ginger entree with veggies and tofu and Panang curry with veggies and tofu.

Me- do you like what u got?
Hubby- the best panang curry ever!!
Me- I agree...

And we lived happily ever after.."}
{"text":"Their sushi is amazing! I'm here weekly for lunch. The service can be hit or miss though, depending on who is there. The woman there knows me by name and is very friendly, the other man, not so much. 4 stars due to service."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO! New owner, TERRIBLE SERVICE & small portions. We went based on the online reviews but those reviews are old and based on the last owner. Party of 6, we waited 15 to be seated when there were open tables everywhere. Ordered 3 small rolls and waited 20 minutes for our food to come out. No napkins or plates were given to us, we had to ask for them. Then our food came out on 1 platter despite there being 3 separate orders at the table. Our one friend was told he could not order what he wanted because they were out. Left alone for over 20 minutes after that. Asked for bills when random waiter walked by and then 20 more minutes went by before our waitress came by to ask if we wanted our bills. Worst sushi restaurant we have been to in the area & will NEVER go back. Sushi was below average on taste & especially on portions. Talked with friends who said that new owner has no idea what she is doing and fired everyone when she bought the place in order to save money. Ruined our night."}
{"text":"First time there.  Will definitely be back.  The lamb curry was great.  Even my 8 year old was pleased."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai food. Like need-to-go-to-a-support group/ need it like crack at least once a week kind of love. I have tried a few different places in the Cleveland area. My sister and I ventured here and the food was excellent, but the service was very slow and the waiter...really freaked us out. He was spaced out. But all that we could handle. The worst part was....there were four people behind us in a booth and when  they were finished with their dinner, the waiter asked them \"if they used some of these dishes\"... Like the ones that were not used...he would reset the other tables with. My sister turned to the table as we were leaving and said \"I think he may be on some drugs\" and the lady said \"Here I am..coughing all over the table and he wants to re use the plates??\" She had been coughing the entire time. Eeeeeek!  This made us never want to return. Food seemed  high quality and was delicious, though. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Stopped for lupper on a Friday afternoon. 
We both got curries, she a sweet style with shrimp, and I a green curry with shrimp.
It would be great if Asian restaurants recognized that squid might be an unwelcome component in their mixed seafood dishes.  I can't believe I'm the only person that dislikes sucking on tentacles while they return the favor; thus a seafood curry that was choice number one got deep-sixed.
We got an order of their spring rolls.....nothing special here just cabbage and dough.  I also missed the bite of hot mustard  as it was served only with a sweet sauce.
The curries were both terrific.
Like far too many restaurants, the tails were left on the shrimp here.
Why must I reach into my curry and grab the little bugger to wrestle off the tail?
It might be typical in other cultures to eat the tail, but I prefer my fiber in forms that don't make me gag!
If you insist on leaving the tails, at least provide a finger bowl to the hapless diner.
It was 3 PM and this was the first meal of the day for us both, so hunger may have been a factor, but it was really good!
Several things I liked about the way they served the dishes, the curries came in a bowl on a plate, and the rice in a separate bowl.
One of our big laments when dining on curry is typically the inability to get all the curry from dish to mouth. Spoons are never part of the service.
Finally, someone addressed this and served the curry with a soup spoon.  If one was inclined one could demurely lace rice on the plate and gently dress it with the curried veggies and protein, or, as we were happy to do, just dump the rice in the bowl and have at it with the spoon!
Brown rice is available for an extra buck.
The amount of rice served is paltry, about a cup.
I NEED the contrast of curry-free rice to help my mouth rebound from the heat in the stuff, but there wasn't enough to even adequately combine with the curry, let alone save a bit on the side to put out fires.
Had staff ventured by at some point I would have requested more, but no such luck until we were both beyond it serving any point."}
{"text":"Pick up time was fast; but the pad thai was not good. it was probably the worst i have ever had. And the top of it was sprinkled in yellow lettuce. weirdest thing."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out.  Green Curry with Tofu and Tom Yum soup.  The service was exactly what you want for take-out...quick!  
The food is good.  I would definitely order when back in this area.  Be careful of the spice.  I like things spicy, and \"medium\" here makes my sinuses go crazy!"}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner around 5:30pm.  The restaurant was empty when we arrived, but several other parties came in during the course of our meal.  I have to agree with Chris on the decor.  A lot of Thai establishments are less-than subtle in their interior decorating.  Thai Origin has done a good job of presenting themselves as an upscale dining option.

We were promptly seated when we arrived and drink orders were taken.  The waitress was very happy to answer the questions that we had.  I ordered the Fruity Fried Rice (which is known in other places as Pineapple Fried Rice), while my friend ordered the Panang Curry.

Our food was delivered to our table within 15 minutes, tops.   We were both pleased with the portion size and the flavor.  Our waitress was quick to refill our water glasses several times.

The prices were reasonable for dinner and the staff was very friendly.  I would definitely stop by again if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"I travel to the area for work every week and a few weeks ago a few of my colleagues and I came here for dinner. This was my first time to Thai Origin but not theirs.  One of them said how good the summer rolls are and so each of us got an order to start off our dinner. They were, hands down, the BEST summer rolls I've ever had!  Most other places stuff them full of noodles with very little vegetable or meat but not here. It had the perfect ratio of noodles, veggie, meat.  And the meat!  It's not shrimp, which is what I usually find in summer or spring rolls. It's a fantastically flavored ground chicken.  And the sweet peanut sauce that comes with it was a perfect dip for the rolls.  For the main entree, I ordered the lamb curry, which was just lamb meat in a panang curry sauce.  Nothing mind blowing but it was still really good.  Two of my colleagues ordered the drunken noodles (or pad kee mao), which looked really good and I made a mental note to try that at some point. 

Since that first visit I have been back about 5 times, 3 of which were this week.  Yes, it's only Thursday so you calculated correctly: I have had Thai Origin for dinner every night this week since I got here Monday!  IT'S THAT GOOD, PEOPLE!  I'm not a huge fan of the chain restaurants that are in the area and I love that the food is made fresh and they do not use MSG. Another bonus is that it's right down the street from my hotel.  

So far the dishes I've tried are:

lamb curry - good
lobster pad thai - good
spicy tuna salad - really good
seaweed salad (I combined this with the spicy tuna salad and it was AWESOME!)
Rama Garden - excellent if you're looking for something really healthy.  I got it to go so they put sauce on the side.
summer rolls - excellent!  I've gotten an order (or 2) every time I've eaten here.  THAT is how good they are.
spider roll - wasn't too impressed but only b/c the soft shell crab seemed to have been overcooked.  I will try other sushi rolls in the future. 

I love that they don't use MSG and offer brown rice as an alternative to the white rice.  They are extremely reasonably priced and offer a variety of dishes.  If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend going!  It's in a strip mall so the location is a little obscure but you won't regret it, I promise!

See you next week, Thai Origin!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place! I don't so much anymore because I think I have eaten there too many times in too short a time period.

My favorites are the duck soup. I think it's boneless, and it's crispy even when immersed in the broth. Every time I come across a duck crossing in the road, I think of this soup.

I think this place has the best vegetarian sushi in town. I love the sweet potato roll! 

The service used to be great. Sometimes the staff would stop by to chat. A few times though, they seemed to ignore me and never gave me the bill. This was probably because I was reading a book and their take on a situation like that is to let people read. Understandable."}
