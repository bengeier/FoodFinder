{"text":"What Lisa said.  It''s not too bad.  Two gorditas rice, beans and a soda ran me $8.65.  I had the chicken in mole and chorizo with potatoes.  Both were a little greasy.  Salsa bar was a little weak but I can deal.  Girl at he counter had to work a little with my english but the order came out right.  Floor was prticularly dirty although I went in late, maybe it would look better in the morning.  Overall I'd go back if I were near there but I won't be making any speacial trips."}
{"text":"Ummm... gorditas.... I approve :) Salsas - are an OK. Shredded cabbage was a nice compliment to a meal.   P.S. People... I know it's America but after so many years living in LV I have no trouble ordering food in Spanish. Just accept the fact that not everyone does speak English and get a couple of Spanish food ordering lessons. Don't diss the place just because of that."}
{"text":"I just got out of the hospital after getting food poisoning here. I DO NOT !  recommend this place At all they are rude, customer service sucks!"}
{"text":"i ordered a pastor burrito w/ chips and salsa. ok, here we go. when i ordered the burrito, the person taking my order asked \"with everything?\" and i said \"yes, please\" because i like everything with everything. all that came in there was pastor, rice and refried beans. no onions, cilantro, salsa or anything. now, i know every place does their food different, duh, that's why i like trying new places all the time but in my opinion, this burrito was missing a lot. it consisted of mostly beans, and they weren't good all. i think they could have taken a lot of those beans out of there and put in one more ingredient. also, this was the saltiest food i have ever eaten, ever. i couldn't tell if it was coming from the beans or the meat, which means it was probably both. i think the salsa might have been really salty too but it was hard to tell, since i was putting it on chips as well as the saltiest food of all time. oh yeah, chips were stale. i'm bummed because i was told this place was good by a couple of different people. i don't know them very well but i know i can't trust their taste in food now."}
{"text":"The tortillas are made on-site and the portion sizes are good.  The quesadilla had no flavor.  The cashier was not friendly."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place and I was actually very impressed. This place is a little outside the box. I really enjoyed the bean and cheese as well as the potato gorditas. The service was alright and they were not very patient with a new comer but it was fast and able to be taken to go. Ill return to las gorditas soon."}
{"text":"Great price. Great potions. Yummy food. Tried chicken nachos, carne asada gordita, and el pastor gordita with rice & beans. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the Gorditas yet..I also think $4 for a gordita is too much...I tried the chihuahua quesadilla and it was ok.. Not really impressed..Didnt really have any flavor and the flour tortilla was burnt..I think I could make a better quesadilla at home...the two women behind the counter were rude and not very helpfull.."}
{"text":"Four ladies went and thought the food was terrible.  One did not eat her beef quesidilla after one bite.  One order was wrong.  One of the women didn't feel well the next day.  We will not be going back -- and we all like Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? ONE gordita for 4 dollars?! That is absolutely insane.  In Mexico I'm used to buying them for 1-2 dollars. And they have a ton of meat and filling.  These are not bad but I can't believe they are this expensive. My mom makes gorditas all the time and she spends less than 10 dollars for about 13 gorditas with a ton of meat filling.  That is way overpriced. It cannot take more than 2 dollars for them to make one. Probably even less.  The actual gorditas were pretty good but no way am I paying 4 dollars for one. I can't believe people are actually paying that much for one. I can't forget to say I got a raspado (shaved ice) for about 6 dollars! why is this place so insanely expensive?! It was actually really good but 6 dollars?! That probably costs them 2 dollars to make. I couldn't believe they were charging 6 dollars for one raspado. The raspado was more than a venti drink at Starbucks and everyone is always complaining how expensive that it."}
{"text":"If you want a good authentic Mexican gordita this is the place to go.  I had the two gordita plate ( it comes with rice and beans and cabbage salad) one Chile relleno gordita and one bean and cheese gordita.   Both were very good.  My daughter had the crane asada gordita and she thought the meat was good. My husband had a picadillo gordita and he loved it.  They also had the carne asada nachos which were huge and they enjoyed them as well.   They have horchata!  Me and my son always order horchata to drink  when we find a place that offers it.  The young lady was very nice and welcoming too.  So that's always a plus.    The place is a little small but it didn't feel crowded it still felt comfortable the way they set up the tables and seating.  We were planning our next visit before we left.  It is a little far from us but it is worth the drive every now and then for a good gordita."}
{"text":"Third time this week coming in. Fresh hand made wipes and Gorditas are the way to go, today I had the elite on top of the order of Gorditas takes about 10 mins for fresh homemade food!"}
{"text":"Credit where credit is due: I wouldn't even know about this place if not for Stephanie S.'s review. I've driven by a lot and ended up at other Mexican food restos in the area because the location signage is limited. It's in the corner of the Marketon plaza, and the interior is nice and homey.  But I came here for gorditas, which are way more popular in Texas than in Vegas, and they've been hard to find. In addition to the namesake stuffed pockets, the menu also offers plates as well as a variety of street snacks and raspados.   I've tried three gorditas and an elote and I'll be back for more. The gorditas don't look huge but their appearance is deceptive and they're actually quite filling. The asada and chile relleno flavors have a premium charge, and were the two I tried first. The asada I found dry but the relleno was overflowing with cheese- I combined all the fillings into one pocket and it was perfection!  Adding a side of guac is another option. The chicken tinga was just okay; solid flavor on the sauce but the pocket got soggy and fell apart fast.  Plates come with rice and some amazing refried beans, or you can order a la carte and get their awesome elote en vaso with the works."}
{"text":"This should be about a 3-1/2 stars.  It's a small chain, no frills, but it wasn't too bad.  I had the chicken chipotle and the chicken mole gorditas with rice and beans.  The chicken mole sauce tastes exactly like what I make when I am willing to spend the time to make it--and that rates 5 stars.  The chicken chipotle was a bit greasy, but not overwhelmingly so.  The beans and rice were ordinary, as were the salsa bar offerings."}
{"text":"The raspados are perfect and so is the elote en vaso it's super cute too has framed Diego Rivera paintings and has a very authentic feel"}
{"text":"Came in for the second time only cause the food is super delicious and priced just right plus you can get desert after your meal. But it'll be the last time. Some people lack the common sense every human being has enough of or so I thought. This family comes in nothing out of the ordinary but then their child walks in with a dog. Again nothing out of the ordinary if this place was out on the street or out in the open and the kitchen was closed but its exactly the opposite they sit the dog next to the table I'm a dog lover and owner myself but I wouldnt take my dog to a place where I know serves food. COMMON FUCKEN SENSE! To make matters worst the people that worked there didn't say or do anything to correct they actually looked straight at the dog next to the table. Will be my second and last time me or any of my family comes to this place the food is delicious but if they allow a animal into the place what else do they allow in here to make them it's ok to do this type of thing??"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place so decided to stop by today.  I got the carne asada gordita and it was a lot smaller than I thought. Also was served plain, just filled with meat, which was dry and not seasoned.  My daughter got the chicken burrito which she said was fatty. My husband got the pork & green sauce gordita and the pork skin with green sauce gordita.  Both were poorly flavored, he did not like them. We won't be back. Food was not worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not a big raspados fan, but my girlfriend is so I took her here. The service was kind of friendly I suppose and it took a long time. I tried some of the pineapple one and it was ok. My girlfriend says she has had better in Vegas cheaper. Her main complaint was that the flavor seemed to disappear much faster than others she has tried."}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" lunch place.  The service is fast, people are nice, establishment is clean, prices are affordable and the food is consistently delicious.   I always get the 2 gordita plate.  It comes with rice and beans.  The servings are generous.  I usually have to bring some home with me.  Be sure to go all out and get the horchata or jamica.  Both are made from scratch."}
{"text":"It took forever for two raspados, but well worth it! Raspados are delicious! Topped with the fruit of whichever flavor you've chosen. You can get half and half! Do it!! I got a half limon half guayaba raspado. So good.  Took it back to the hotel and turned it into an adult beverage. (If you catch my drift) ;)  Would have liked to try the churros!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Mexican food!!! And amazing Mexican snacks too.... You must try it! I been coming to this place for all ready some years ... And I just found them again, planing to come Nanci many many times!"}
{"text":"Was across the street at America First Bank, then noticed the Raspado  truck across the street so decided to come and get one. The flavor I picked was ciruela \"plum\" with some \"lechera\" condensed milk. It tasted really good when I drank it from the straw but when I wanted to actually eat the ice was when I was met with a challenge... the snow was more like crushed ice. See the picture... I gave them 3 stars because the service was great and the length of time that it took to make it was fast but the actually snow was not really what I was expecting.   I am willing to give them a better chance at getting a better review from me if they upgrade their snow machine and make snow cones not crushed ice raspados. If you have dentures or sensitive teeth like me, this place is not recommended at all."}
{"text":"I did not find the gorditas that fascinating. But later I found out that every gordita in different regions of Mexico are made differently, so then I got it. The meat is super good and smooth. But I believe that meat will go even better on their Guaraches, tacos, or sopes. I don't think on there gorditas it was all that great. I ordered the two gordita plate. I loved the plates and the salsa! How often do you do somewhere and find the plates where they are serving the food to be great?    I had a chipotle and a chicen one. They were both good. Oh yes Su N. the Gorditas are $3.50! Not four bucks. Either way if they were 4 bucks you won't find them cheap anywhere else, so live with it. Why go to a restaurant and complain about making them yourself for then? Kinda very missing the point of going out and tasting other peoples ways of making food right?     The gorditas Ive' ate in the past are estillo Michoacan so thats why I was so taken back when I got these. I just didn't know. The seating was pretty cool and it was clean inside. All in all whenever you pass by this place, to me, you always imagined it all nasty and dirty inside, but quite the opposite. OH yes they open at 10AM on Sundays and the rest of the days too."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional expect the meat was a bit spicy for me since I dislike chile."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today. I don't speak any Spanish but the waitress was understanding and understandable! The food was made fresh and was delicious! I will be back! And thank you for being so welcoming!"}
{"text":"The gorditas are fresh and handmade. I had the pork verde my wife had the chorizo con papas. Come for the food and great atmosphere. Very quaint and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. From the flavorful meats, to the succulent tortillas to the vibrant salsas, every bite was worth the drive over. Thank you for bringing some authentic Mexican food to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We're being generous in giving 3 stars. The food quality relative to the prices would merit a 1.5 or 2, but we give extra for the friendly service. We recall dining here before and liking it a lot more before but we can't remember why. If your desperate for taco truck style you're in luck. However, just like there are differences between most trucks and GOOD trucks, this falls into the very average crowd."}
{"text":"An amazing little hidden authentic gem.  The food,  service and price were just unbelievable. They have a variety of vegetarian dishes and the green avocado salsa to die for."}
{"text":"it's been a few years since I wrote my original review so i thought I'd update it. We go about 1 every 2 or 3 moths since its it a schelp to East side of Vegas for us. We went yesterday and got our order to go to watch the \"big game\" 25 gorditas and each one was done consistently and close to perfect. My fave is still the chili verde one but i like the carne asada one as well.  We might have to make this monthly instead of quarterly.  and props that my Spanish ordering skills have improved & they have actually haired people who are bi-lingual."}
{"text":"There aren't really any places that serve gorditas, this places has the namesake... and it lives up to its name!   The gorditas here are super delicious and filling! I ordered the 3 plate and was filled with just one! I ordered the carne asada (.25 upcharge) and tinga. Your meal includes rice and beans that were so so delicious!!! The gorditas only come with whatever is on the item, so the gordita pocket and carne asada, nothing else. If you want a side of guac, it's 2.50 more, but they have some delicious green guacamole sauce and crema, SO BOMB!  The inside is clean and spacious, and there's only 3 workers, so calm your titties if you have to wait.  The food here is priced right and the portions are the traditional Mexican kind, LARGE. My friend ordered 2 sopes place, and the entire plate was full!!! She said they were so delicious as well!  I would definitely recommend this place, EAT MEXICAN AND EAT LOCAL!!!   AJUA PINCHES PUTOS!  No \"food poisoning\" over here, either. Plus, they got our food right the first time, but that could be because we don't look like a bunch of salty, putas perras. We have class and are nice to those taking our order. IF YOU'RE RUDE TO THOSE WHO TAKE YOUR ORDER AND SERVE YOUR FOOD, GO FUCK YOURSELF AND CHOKE ON AN ELOTE.  KTHANKSBYEEEEEEEE."}
{"text":"REAL Authentic Mexican food and it's delicious!!!! Prices are reasonable and we'll worth it. The staff there are always very nice and attentive. I recommend the Gorditas and the horchata! I'm a regular since 4/2016!!"}
{"text":"They are unorganized!! When you first walk in they dont acknowledge you at all..  and you have figure out what to do, they dont tell you to have a sit, they see you standing there and they ignore you. After a good 2 minutes we grabbed a menu and we went and looked for a table.. the lady was super rude and food wasnt fully cooked. The only good thing was my Coke and that's because it was in a can so there was no way for then to screw it up."}
{"text":"Las Gorditas is a great spot for some quick, authentic mexican food.  Their signature item is their gorditas, which are like doughy tortillas that are stuffed with different stews, meats, and condiments.  My favorite is the Chicken with mole, the pork with adobo, pork with green chile, and the chicken with green chile. The restaurant has a small bar with condiments such as marinated onions, jalapenos, salsas, and sour cream.  All of these condiments go great with the gorditas. The gorditas are around $2.50 each, but are definitely worth it.   The other great item on their menu is their Carne Asada and Cactus Quesadilla.  The cactus is roasted and stuffed into a fresh tortilla with cheese and freshly grilled carne asada.    I would highly suggest trying Las Gorditas!"}
{"text":"Wow , we just found a Little restaurant that serves homemade Mexican food. Delicious sopes and Gorditas. The Champurrado is awesome too. Oops I almost forgot Homemade Flan , nothing like what you normally find mass produced."}
{"text":"I thought this place was delicious. I ordered a guarache. i wished I had ordered different  meat = instead of the carne asada. I'd def.order the guarache again! My bf ordered 3 gorditas. oh my goodness. each one better than the next. He had chicken in mole, and 2 others that i cant remember but we really wanted to order the nopales one but we were too full to even try it."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have vegetarian options and the gordita's are delicious. Every time my husband and I come to Vegas we have to come here for lunch. We haven't found anybody that makes Gorditas this good, even in L.A.  The service is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Best gorditas in town great food great people the raspados are very good aswell I will definitely come back some time soon"}
{"text":"I was in town from Az for a soccer tournament for my son and on the way saw the big sign by the street and caught my eye. I am a big yelp user and give credit and reviews to those who deserve. The gorditas were so delicious and very filling. I had a chicken mole, asada and chorizo con papas. The place was clean and pretty spacious. We did wait a bit but was worth the wait. I will always support small businesses. Muchas gracias muy deliciosas sus gorditas.."}
{"text":"I thought I would stop by here for lunch because I have never had a Gordita before.  Well... actually... I have never eaten a gordita... ohh wait a minute.  Ok - I have never had a gordita at lunch time.... uhhh.  How do I put this?? I have never had the food product known as a gordita!  It is your basic quick serve Mexican style restaurant, but it has different menu options like Gorditas.  A gordita is similar to a pupusa, a thick corn tortilla stuffed with meat.  I ahd the chicharone, pork, and chicken mole.  The tortilla part is not very big, but it is stuffed generously.    The pork and the mole had a lot of flavor.  The chicharone was a little plain.  There is a salsa bar with a few options.  Everything tasted better than your average quick serve place, overall it was really good food.   The place is nothing fancy but it is a good place for quick cheap eats!"}
{"text":"I always drive by Las Gorditas but I had never bothered to stop. I have had penguinos raspados elsewhere (washtington and pecos had a penguinos shop a while ago). Going in i knew they would have gorditas on the menu but i was impressed when i saw Huaraches on the menu.   My wife ordered every chicken gordita and they were all great. I ordered the Huarache and the only thing that was bad was that the meat was a bit tough on the edges but otherwise the Huarache was delicious.  We also ordered an elote en vaso and a raspado de mango y nuez. The \"elote en vaso\" Is corn in a cup with mayo butter chilli powder and cheese. If you have ever bought a corn from the man with the shopping cart its basically the same thing except in a cup. The \"raspado\" is shaved ice with the flavors that i got where mango and nuts. The flavoring is not ike your normal shaved ice flavoring though its a syrup with fresh mango pieces mix in it same thing for the nuts. Then they top it off with condensed milk not alot of people like it but I LOVE IT.  I would highly recommend the Raspados on hot days to cool you off."}
{"text":"Carne asada gorditas are the best!!! Best gorditas in town. Try their Horchata too."}
{"text":"I live in AZ and every time that I visit Vegas Gorditas is a must! The Gorditas are absolutely AMAZING!  Being from the East Coast and growing up on DR, PR, and Cuban foods I've developed a taste for Flan. Las Gorditas has THEE BEST flan that I've ever had on the Southwest/West Coast.  If you decide to visit try the Mole Gordita and the Flan. Let me know what you think!"}
