{"text":"So I'm by no means an expert of Mediterranean food but this place was pretty good. It was my first visit last night with my bf. The restaurant is nothing special on the inside, very simply decorated but clean. 

Service: great! We had a gentleman at first but then a young lady took over and she was very attentive and came by often enough to check on our drinks and to see if we had everything we needed. 

Food: My bf got the kabob plate which I can't remember what it was called but it included a beef,chicken,and some sort of sausage skewer. The sausage I thought was the best followed by the beef and chkn. Bf liked them all and simply loved his food! I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and it was light and filling. And just to add to all the other reviews....the fries really are good!! They are crispy and not greasy at all. Idk what they do but it's working!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious! The atmosphere shows that it is a growing business, but the experience was great none the less. The servers were friendly and the Chicken Shawarma was amazing. I've been to many casual Mediterranean restaurants, and Olives' shawarma was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I give five stars for the food! It was my first time at the Ayrsley location and i was pleasantly surprised. I was going in wanting something with a red sauce, but everything it literally off the grill and \"light\" (according to the waitress). My only negatives are that the  waitress was really rude and it was really dark inside but holy cow the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My SO and I were in the area shopping and thought we would give this place a try for lunch. This was the best decision we made all day! Order two different type of hummus and a gyro. Everything was absolutely delicious! We will be returning."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, all fresh ingredients.  My husband and I stopped  at Olives for a late lunch on Sunday.  The service was good. Lunch began with complimentary homemade pita and yogurt.  I had the Palmyra Salad with a chicken kabob and a wonderful lentil soup. My husband had the Chicken Shawarma.   The owner was present and stopped by our table to see how we liked the food. The atmosphere is bland, but the outside seating will be very nice when the weather is warm. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Focaccia with gyro was great. I've eaten here many times and forgotten to review. The service is pretty quick, and the food doesn't take very long to prepare."}
{"text":"Love the food here! We have both dined in and taken out. It's a new restaurant so the dine in experience was a bit all over the place. The food is unforgettable!!! I hope this place stays open because this is as good as it gets for authentic Mediterranean!!!! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Very authentic chicken shawarma. Includes pickles and fries which are a must. They are generously portioned and delicious. Staff and owners are super friendly. Definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner. If you like Turkish and/or Syrian food, you will not be disappointed. If you're not familiar, you owe it to yourself to explore the menu."}
{"text":"We are glad to have Olives Mediterranean Grill close by!  The chicken shawarma was excellent & full of flavor.  We really enjoyed the cilantro jalapeno hummus too!"}
{"text":"We tried Olive's for the first time, we will definitely go back... Both the food and the value were great, as well as the staff!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and quick.  I ordered the Greek Salad.  It looks NOTHING like the picture on the menu.  Although the ingredients that were included were fresh, they omitted cucumbers entirely, it only had a sliver of red onion and 2 olives.  The feta cheese was a minimal sprinkling on top, not the chunks as indicated in the picture.  A Greek vinaigrette dressing was supposed to be included but it tasted more like the lemon vinaigrette listed in other salads.  Disappointing!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. This place use to be a Moe's so the place isn't visually appealing. Interior could use an overhual. Food was great of  course, the chef's are awesome,  the servers were lacking knowledge."}
{"text":"Tons of flavor in the food, the price and portions are great, and all fresh and homemade.  The baklava is delicious!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious lunch! We tried the hummus and falafel dish as well as the kale and quinoa salad with chicken shawarma. Both were delicious and filling. Not a fancy restaurant, order from the counter and the food is brought to your table, plastic utensils and drinkware, but good food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good. The fresh made pitas are amazing. Portions were generous. Staff and customer service was amazing. They made us feel very welcomed. They even gave us a soft opening discount since they only opened up 3 days ago. We will be back. It's a must try for sure."}
{"text":"Gyros are amazing, flatbreads are fresh, steak pitas are the best I have ever had! All around great fresh food. The guys here are even better, make you feel like you are at the dinner table in their own home. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Nasty, very overpriced food. Stood there for 10-15 minutes before we were even acknowledged because the only waitress didn't want to stop talking to her friend. We gave her the benefit of the doubt because she was pregnant and hormones and stuff. We really should have just left. There was only one table with people and now I understand why, neither one of us could finish our food from how unpalatable it was. Do not be fooled by the decent pictures of their food on here. We will never be back. This was Friday night at 8:45 It's a miracle this place is even open because they have both bad service and bad food. Come on, you can only have one of the two. This place literally left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"You get one chance to make a first impression and Olives failed miserably. I can't comment on the food because it never came. After watching other people who came after us get their meals, we simply left and spent our money elsewhere. The wait staff was OK but there is no reason a sandwich can't make it to my table. Not going back - there are too many places willing to do food service right to waste my time here."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I found the shawarma was not only delicious, the portion was more than generous. You will not be disappointed especially when you take into account how reasonable it is! This will become a regular for me."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean place to eat. Pita bread is good and the chicken shawarma is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent pitas and hummus.  Everything was tasty, fresh and the staff were all friendly.  If only they had Mythos beer..."}
{"text":"Yulk is what comes to mind first! It rook 3 times to get my order right. I said sauce on side waitress brought it back with extra sauce. The pita is prepared them when you order it is saturated with more grease. Food not hot at all! I got a gryo & requested the tizi on the side.  The waitress didnt know what tizi was. We were checked on by the waitress who was on her cell phone &  eating. Phone to ear trying to see what we needed. Final blow was attemptimg to pay the tab. Their system \"went down & we were asked to wait for the owner to arrive so he could fix the problem. After waiting 10 mins. I got steamed! The cook said owner said five minute. Then the cook suggested we leave our credit card # so they can process it later....Uh NO thanks.
Will NOT be patronizing this place again! Oh lastly the cook does not specialize in Mediterranean cusine & I jad bubble guts before arriving home. Let's see if they are in business this time next year. One positive note the waitress was a sweet girl."}
{"text":"The food is really good and very reasonably priced -- healthy and varied selection of midwestern fare. There is real pride of ownership and quality. We've now returned several times, and Olives will continue to be a go to place for a casual quick meal."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food and a great variety of choice. A good alternative to \"fast food\". I always love some good Mediterranean food in this place Will give it to you!!"}
{"text":"This place was close and I decided I would give them a try.  I had a Gyro with the salad meals option. Paid about $13 for the gyro, Greek salad, and drink. Place was clean and the staff were very nice. The gyro was a pretty good size and tasted great. Salad was larger than some I had had. I would go back when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"A welcoming, friendly staff offering fresh, delicious Mediterranean food at a reasonable price, in a clean & pleasant environment. A tasty and healthier local neighborhood addition. We so thoroughly enjoyed our takeout that we returned for lunch the very next day, and plan to visit 
as soon as I post this. 
Note: Enter thru left door and order at register... it's the opposite of how Garbanzo  was set up."}
{"text":"Rough experience from beginning to end.  Intended to eat-in with a colleague with 30-minutes to work with.  Ordering was painful, as person at register struggled to correctly input our order.  Accidentally overcharged us by $21 somehow, and had to bring cash out to table to fix problem.  After 15 minutes of waiting we changed order to \"to-go,\" and were then presented with wrong food.  The wrap was decent, although not nearly as many options for toppings as other mediterranean restaurant options.  I wish them well, but won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant which recently opened and really enjoyed their Mediterranean food.  It is nice change and great for the neighborhood.The restaurant is very clean and the service is very quick."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Atmosphere is bright, pleasant and clean. Service is prompt, friendly and attentive. Food is wonderful!  It was so fresh and flavorful, I  as though  was at Club Med. I hope the weather is a bit nicer the next time I go so I can enjoy the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This place is legit! I've been to several different mediterranean places including those that are connected to markets. This place is way better than all of them! Their grand opening was very busy and wait times were long, but been back since and service was very fast!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Tasty, fresh & hot. Great flavors. They brought bread & yogurt for the table to start, & that's a nice touch.

There's no hostess stand, so you walk in & awkwardly stand like an idiot until you get noticed.
The waitresses took my glass when it was empty but didn't offer a refill (all this before the check). 
Pricing will hurt them. $12 & then they charged me $2 to sub out a side.  With a $2 tip, nobody's paying $16 for a wrap combo. That won't last. They'd be better off with counter service & revamp the pricing. I hope this place lasts....the food is too good!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the 2nd best Mediterranean restaurant I've been to in the 3 years I've lived in AZ. Food was great, staff super friendly, and overall ambience was really mellow. This is my new spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and we had a gyros salad, cilantro jalapeño hummus, 2 falafels (which were made fresh) and a steak pita. Everything tasted very good and the portion sizes were generous. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was delicious. We ordered the falafel, the double meat plate, and the protein plate. They were all good. I wasn't crazy about the rice but everything else was delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"I got a plate of the Gyros Platter and it was an appropriate amount of food in my to-go container. I've had more in other places and states but hey, i guess a girls got to watch her figure at some point. Plus, it wasn't like it was just a grain of rice and a bit of meat-it was definitely more than that. 

The saffron rice that came with it was nice and fluffy as well as flavorful. I know what you're thinking, can someone really mess up rice. YES, i've had it undercooked and way over cooked before. This wasn't the case here. It was cooked and mouse...just probably the size of two small scoops. The gyros that came with it was 4 very thing slices off the large meat post. The meat was also tastey and moist and comes with the cucumber taziki yogurt sauce but again, not much of it. Halfway through my two strips of meat i completely ran out of sauce and tried licking the insides for all i could get. 

Overall, this place isn't bad, i would just recommend not being so cheap with the food... oh and definitely getting the food ready a lot quicker. I called my order in and came 20 mins later and they still hadn't had my order ready. I was the only person there!."}
{"text":"I am here in this restaurant four times now for staff is very friendly and helpful very nice people I recommend this to all friends and family very friendly and good place to take your family to eat I'm wearing recommend this to anybody good men in for any food I get this place thumbs up five stars I have had four things off the menu I have like the mall they are all awesome my friend has had trek and she lloved them too  Mobile back many times to enjoy the awesome"}
{"text":"This is the third or fourth time I've been here.  It's pretty good for fast Mediterranean food.  The chicken and lamb schwarma is really good, I love the Greek salad (the dressing is great)!  The falafel is really good too!  Wasn't a fan of the mediterranean chicken I had today and I thought the jalapeño cilantro hummus was a little bland.  The service is pretty fast but I think the line/ordering is a bit confusing...I wish we were greeted when we came in so we kind of knew where to start.  I've watched many people come in and also be confused about how the process works.  I forgot to mention, the pita bread is fresh and delicious!  Overall it's a pretty good place...fresh, fast, and consistent."}
{"text":"Fantastic option for Mediterranean food. The restaurant is brand new so the service had a few glitches when I went in, but the food makes is so worth the very minor service issues.  You won't be disappointed with the portion sizes or flavors. The food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service! Our favorite place to eat on a monthly basis! Gyro combo and Greek salads are delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh and clean. Vast, menu while still covering the basics. No potato salad in the Greek salad though???"}
{"text":"We really loved it. We had delicious little doughnut shaped falafels, good tabouli, tasty hummus and pillowy pita. It was really clean inside, it had a lot to offer on the menu, and the employees were super sweet. Happy to have this place nearby."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, great place with a lot of potential. You walk in and you notice a very clean and organized place, looks like a well ran family restaurant.
Got the beef Shawarma, one of the best I've ever had in the states, very tasty and the meet was very tender. The service was great, two nicely dressed and clean looking girls helping each other out, big smile on their faces.

Now for suggestions:

-  Prices a little high, 8.99 for a wrap plus tax plus tip  = $12 lunch. They would be much better off doing no service, and you order from the window and sit and the food gets brought to you, at least you wouldn't have to worry about the tip

- You walk in for the first time and you don't know if you should sit, wait to be seated or walk up to the window

- kitchen staff should wear matching outfits since its a glass line and you can see everything, and they should try to move faster and show that they are working hard. You just get the impression they are not too motivated.

Besides that, great place with amazing food and lot of potential."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hummus in town. The food is fresh and yummy!!! You MUST try this place"}
{"text":"Olives is newly opened this week. Took the entire family -- me, husband and all four kids. We all loved it and enjoyed our meal. We went around 2 PM on a Saturday. Small staff, seems family owned. Everyone was really nice. Service was efficient although there was a short wait for our order. 

The food tastes great. I ordered the chicken kabob dinner which comes with rice, pita bread and a side. I chose the Mediterranean salad for my side. The salad was crisp and fresh. My only complaint is it could use more feta cheese. The kabobs were delicious. The chicken was moist, flavorful and well cooked. You get two kabobs with the dinner platter. The pita tasted fresh and homemade. An excellent complement to the chicken. The best part of my meal was the rice. Possibly the best rice I have ever eaten. Light, fluffy, flavorful. Really, it was so good I wanted to eat everyone's rice. 

We wanted to try the baklava for dessert. Unfortunately, they were out with a 30 minute wait for more. Not a big deal as long as it doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place! Very good gyros  and loved the falafel! I definitely will come back again.  I payed for1 gyro  $6.95 but if you want fries  and a drink it  would be $3.95 extra. So I figured no fries for me and just plain water. Trying to eat and drink healthier."}
{"text":"Came to Olives for the first time hoping for some good Greek food but much like most of the other Yelp reviewers, was horribly disappointed.  After ordering a falafel with Mediterranean salad (with Italian dressing) as well as a vegetable plate, both orders came to the table wrong even with 3 of the young servers coming to the table.  The bottom line is, the food is just ok but the service, time to receive food, and the attention to food detail leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the food. There really wasn't anything to get excited for. The rice really had no flavor and the hummus was also plain. The chicken plate was alright but there was just something missing. The pita was also super thick and hard. It wasn't bad but just nothing to make me want to come back. The place was clean and the service was friendly. I love Mediterranean food but this just really didn't have enough flavor for me to want to come back"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. The service was good and the food was awesome. I got the kabob plate with an assortment of meat and rice. It was very tender and seasoned well. Their fries are even good!"}
{"text":"I thought I left a review the first time we came but I guess I am behind. Well, we came here again tonight and left very satisfied. 

We got a coupon for BOGO meal with purchase of 2 drinks so we stopped in for dinner. Both of us got the 2 meat plate. For my plate, I went with chicken breast and pork. My fiancé got chicken and gyro. I wish one of us didn't get chicken and got steak so that we could try it but he didn't listen to me when we were ordering. Oh well! We plan on coming back so there's always next time. 

The plates also included some pita bread and we both added a side salad to our plates. We tend to snack a lot through the day so we really could have just split the plate and a normal salad instead of 2 plates and 2 side salads. Oh well, leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I actually got to witness them fry falafels while we were putting in our order. It was interesting how they scoop it. 

Back to the food - The pork was better than I had expected. I would get it again and while chicken is my go-to protein, I think this may be my go-to protein at this establishment. I'm not saying I didn't like the chicken (because it was perfectly seasoned!) but the pork just stood out more. Gyro tastes the same to me anywhere so I'm not sure how to review it. 

I was on a cider kick after our London trip so I grabbed the Ace pineapple cider as my beverage. My S/O did the same. It was interesting - not sure if I'll get it again. 

We really like this place in regards to food, service, cleanliness, and variety. Even better that it is down the street!"}
{"text":"We were regulars of Garbanzos, the previous business, so we were thrilled to see it reopened with the same Mediterranean style food. I was sad to see that they chose to move the already walled off line over to the dining area... which made us have to wait to order by the tables while people were trying to enjoy their meals. The food was good but if not for the BOGO coupon I had, I wouldn't have paid the full price. For that price I'd prefer a less cafeteria style atmosphere"}
{"text":"I stopped in to this local joint craving some Greek food on my lunch break. (Hello, pregnant salty cravings!) I grabbed a gyros pita with fries and a side of garlic sauce, which I honestly could've inhaled. The fries smelled so amazing I had to eat them in my car dipped in the heavenly garlic sauce. (Aren't fries what make or break a restaurant?!)

The pita sandwich was awesome: simple, full of flavorful gyro meat, savory tzatziki, and veggies. The entire meal was almost too much for me, and I'm an eater. 

Highly recommend this place for their friendly service, crispy fries, and big portions!"}
{"text":"I am in heaven!  When My Big Fat Greek at Tatum and Shea closed, I was inconsolable.  Now along comes Olives and the gyros that tastes like it was flown in from my favorite Chicago Greek restaurant.  The meat is perfect (not too salty as is often the case) and the construction of the sandwich on the pita just perfect.....right amounts of sauce, tomato and onion.  Pita warm and yummy.  I will be a forever customer!"}
{"text":"So glad that a Mediterranean restaurant has moved into this spot.  The menu is full of wonderful sounding items and I look forward to trying many. I just had a Chicken Pita that was loaded with chicken. the pita bread was light and tasty."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place based on the reviews and the fact that I love Mediterranean food. But I was highly disappointed. 
I order the pork pita with fries and a pop. And my husband ordered the gyro with fries and a pop. I also ordered my boys kid chicken tenders. 
First, I was disappointed with the kids chicken tenders and there was only 3 small chicken tenders for $4.95 and do not include fries or a drink. Fries and a drink were $3.50 more. 
Then my pork was covered in some really spicy seasonings. It was so spicy that I couldn't even eat it. The  tzatiki was good though. There was nothing special about the fries. 
My husband said his gyro was ok. Nothing special and not the best he's ever had. He was happy with the size, saying he thought it was pretty big."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  I always get the Chicken Schwarama!  The owner and staff are super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Don't want to say fast food joint because right away we think of junk food but this place is very casual and you can get your food very quickly.
Love the fact that the owner is from Iran and the staff is also from the Middle East. Makes the food authentic. The food was very delicious. Everything I had was fresh and hot. The pita bread is to die for and the hummus is very flavorful.

I will definitely be back and the place will soon know me by name..lol."}
{"text":"So, the food is good. The prices are appropriate. The service is nice and if you don't feel like driving to Zetounis or Kabob Grill, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Such good food!!!! We love to pick it up and take home.... atmosphere is just OK. The gyros and tabouli salad was great. Can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"Far better than Garbanzos was...but just 'ok' for Gyros.
Very nice people, but the tzaziki is kind of bland."}
{"text":"My mother and I love trying new restaurants in the area so when Olives opened up we were excited to try it. We both had to go to work later on that day, so we stopped in for take out. We ordered our dishes and sat to the side to wait. We ended up waiting around 30 minutes. I noticed the hostess delivering orders to other patrons in the resturant who arrived after us. Patience wearing thin, I decided to ask what the wait would be for our meals, she said \"oh I thought you left, it has been ready\", we honestly sat in her area of vision and we made eye contact while she was walking around the restaurant. So that bothered me because she was not attentive. Then when we arrived home, we received the wrong order. I didn't have time to take the food back, so we tried it. It was ok, nothing spectacular, I ended up picking the chicken out of my kabob sandwich. I honestly would not give Olives another try, like others have said the overall service needs some work and the food was not memorable."}
{"text":"First time I went there I was not impressed. Manager lied to my face about their dolmas being from a can. He said no and they were. He apologized and I let it go. Have them another chance and it was much better."}
{"text":"Ok but has scope of imprpvement..
Kabobs needs to be a little more juicy
Shawarma was good but lacked a little wow factor
Baklawa was major dissapointment for me

Having said all that, hosts were warm people. 
Guys, just add more character to your food and it will surely become a success"}
{"text":"Really good fast casual Mediterranean place. Excellent Falafel and hummus. Their pizzas are light and flavorful. And, they offer reasonably priced wines by the glass. Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy! I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita combo (with fries and drink). They use chicken breast and season it deliciously. And their Tzatziki sauce... mmmmmmmm. The fries were thick and perfectly cooked. I'd prefer a plain, unsweetened tea option, but I'm probably in the minority on that one.

It was a bit of a wait (Saturday at 1pm-ish), but well worth it. Can't wait to return and try some other options."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food is okay. I've had better Mediterranean fare, but I've also had much worse. It's passable and normally I'd say it's worth a return visit. But it's just too expensive. Lunch for two adults and a kid ran us well over $30, and that's with the 15% discount for checking in on Yelp. The kid's meal was a TINY bowl of rice and chicken. The red pepper hummus isn't as good as Pita Jungle's. The falafel isn't as good as Greek Wraps. Store-bought babaghannouj is better. And they were out of Coke Zero. But the tzatziki was ok. Again, it's not horrible, but it's worth maybe half the prices they are charging.

In addition, they mopped the floors while diners were present. Thanks, but I can do without the pungent detergent stench while I'm eating lunch. Likely won't return, nothing here is better value than Pita Jungle quite frankly."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the occasional trip over to Garbanzos near the PV Mall. They were the previous restaurant in this space, before Olives Mediterranean Grill.

In that review, I said: Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed.\"

I've included that portion of my review, because in many ways nothing has changed, except for the name. Even the interior is identical. 

Whether it's called Olives Mediterranean Grill, or Garbanzos, the food is still very good.  The one major improvement is the quantity of food they provide, which is generous. Another, is the addition of pizza, or Focaccias. Nice. 

Entrées are in the $10 to $14 range.  Our bill came to $44.99 for three, including tax and after a 10% discount. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Alright everyone around here knows that Ayrsley is not the place to go for food... we all keep hoping for something stellar to pop up and it never does. Olives took forever to open and honestly their service takes just as long!! Even if you are the only people in the entire restaurant it still can take 20 minutes plus to get your food. The staff was friendly but the restaurant itself looks rather run down. Almost like they didn't redecorate or upgrade or even repaint from the previous tenants. I wasn't really expecting anything good from this place but I  have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I've only gotten one thing here which is the chicken kabobs and they have been really good both times. The flavor is very much on point. I've tried the hummus and the rice that comes on the side which are both good but not brilliant. However considering the total lack of food options in here it fits in and is sort of a welcome addition. 

I will say though, their pricing is rather high for what they are. No one is going to spend $15-$20 at lunch time for this and I don't foresee them lasting very long."}
{"text":"Food and service were great, the dining room was a bit chilly though. I'll definitely  eat lunch here again."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant a very unwelcoming place. The employees were not at all friendly. They did not care about their customers. It was hot and uncomfortable inside. They advertise three types of ice tea availble, and there was none. The soda machine was not working properly and the employees could care-less about it. The food was relatively good, but nothing special.

I would not come here again due to the rude and aloof attitude of the employees."}
{"text":"This place is great to have in the neighborhood! I called and placed an order for pickup, the lady was very sweet over the phone. My husband picked it up so I didn't get to see the inside. The wrong focaccia was given to us but my husband caught it and they fixed the order and gave us both! The cilantro jalapeño hummus was delicious, falafel was good... maybe a tad over fried. Kale salad was yummy. The focaccia (or pizza) as the lady kept calling it was just ok, not very much flavor, I don't think I would order it again."}
{"text":"I like this place.... pretty new. Inside is very new and clean. The staff was nice. I really like the Neapolitan pizza. I did notice they sell wine and beer. My friends had the shawarma and they liked it. Only issues I had is the tend to forget my side orders, happened twice. I should check my order when I pick it up. Recommend you stop by and try it. 

We ordered pick up 3 times and we have yet to receive the full or the correct order."}
{"text":"I have never gone into this place and not liked my food. It's fresh and delicious! The staff is usually really friendly at any of the locations I go to. This is definitely one of my favorites."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat 
I wouldn't say it's really that bad 
If you are looking for a real Mediterranean food you can find better place 
The stuff is clean and organize 
The food come in a good size 
I don't really like the way they serve the food but this my personal problems :) 
I will give it one more shot and hope I would like it better"}
{"text":"Really good food really good atmosphere really good employees friendly nice clean environments highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit here and each time has been fantastic! We've tried the Gyro and Chicken plates, gyro pitas  and the Tabbouleh salad and they were all great! A well earned 5-"}
{"text":"Tried this out yesterday. On a Saturday art 5:15, there were only two other occupied tables. The service was slow but pleasant. I got the vegetarian platter and it was yummy. I will be back. The yogurt cheese dip and pita bread they give you is amazing."}
{"text":"First time eating Mediterranean I must say
Very good guys. I will definitely be back for 
More, love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We used the 50% off ValPack coupon to try this place out  and it was delicious! We ordered a Mediterranean Chicken dish, a Vegetarian dish and a kid's focaccia pizza and all three dishes were fresh and flavorful. We will definitely visit Olives again."}
{"text":"Let's get real folks:  this isn't the place to come to expect stellar service or to bring a hot date.  It is the type of place where you will probably get some pretty good takeout, however.  

I ordered a vegetable plate with hummus, a salad, spinach pie, and falafel and I was pleased with everything.  All of the food was great.  I will be back for some takeout, but I can't see myself dining in."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with our Experience at Olives, It had been a Garbanzos at one point. The ingredients seemed very fresher and the service was very polite & helpful. The establishment was clean with no messy tables which is always nice! I prefer the New Olives recipes & Staff...so Change is a Good Thing! Nice job Olives...I will return!"}
{"text":"Great food, kind service, split the mixed kabobs with a friend perfect amount and unbelievably amazing! Substituted one for a lamb kabob. The best lamb I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We went to Olives today at 11:00am. There was no air-conditioning on and the place was stifling. The drink machine was not working. I asked 3 employees to help and they all ignored me. There was no tea made. The employees seemed unconcerned. When the food was delivered to our table, the employee never said a word and just stared at us. Finally he heaped the food on the table and then walked away. Not one employee ever asked about our experience. The gyro was bland and the meat was dry. The rice was tasteless. Not a good experience for us."}
{"text":"Just tried for first time, and the food and service was beyond 5 stars. Look at this picture, very reasonable prices. Fresh, fulfilling, and I will be back very often. Keep it up, the sky is the limit for this place.  This was the lamb/beef gyro! Look at the meat, and the jalapeño and cilantro hummus!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food is delicious and the stay are friendly. Best Mediterranean around!!"}
{"text":"Very good. We have been there a few times and the falafel wraps are good? Sometimes it takes a while to get the food when they are busy, that's my only complaint. Otherwise, food and service is good!"}
{"text":"8/2017: EXCELLENT SERVICE! We had a party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids). The food is excellent, establishment very clean, service impeccable! What a great experience. The grape leaves are wonderful, the pizza perfect, the shawarma delicious! Kids items are great (I'd add buttered noodles or mac & cheese, but no biggie). The owner is a wonderfully personable man and we Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean place that I crave! The Hummus & Protein plate is delicious no matter what combo (my fav is red pepper hummus with Mediterranean chicken) you get, the pita is made fresh (always soft) & a great portion for the price. 

Staff is super friendly. Once when they served a hummus I didn't request, they instantly replaced the whole plate, told me to keep the \"'mistake\" to-go. Like I said, any combo is good so this was a gift I didn't even ask for.

I travel almost 10 miles out of my way to come here, that says a lot."}
{"text":"(This is the same location where Garbanzo used to be)
I used an Uber credit to get lunch from this place, and oh my, we were truly impressed. The greek fries (potatoes with feta cheese) were perfect, golden, crispy, delicious.
We also had a side of pita chips (which seemed freshly cooked) and they were the best.
Hubby had a gyro pita and it had a very generous portion of meat.

Everything was great, the only misshap is that the gyro did not have sauce, and I had ordered extra.... so we got one little containter which seems to be the regular portion, but not the extra portion I had ordered and paid for.

We liked the food so much we went to look for this place a few days after and found out they are where Garbanzo used to be. Hubby had a gyro and I had a greek salad. Both were very good. Michelle took our order, brought our food and checked on us a couple of times. She was very patient. We also interacted with Rober and he was very kind to us, letting us sample chips and pita.

It is worth to mention that both hubby and me thought this is an example of a business really making an effort to connect with their customers. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"FABULOUS.  Went there on a recomendation from a friend.  Very impressed with selection, speed of ser ice and cleanliness.  Big portions, tasty and value  for money.  Haven't had food this good since I left Bahrain and I lived there 8 years. Will be going there again.  Thank you to all the staff.  Great job."}
{"text":"Just what the neighborhood needed. Delicious, priced right, good size portions, fast and friendly service. They had the origination of a chain restaurant but the flavor of home made. My husband is Greek and Turkish and enjoyed everything we ordered. 2 plates and a side was enough for our family of four. Baklava was perfect. Definitely going to make an effort to go here at least a few times a month."}
{"text":"I love this place, from the food to the staff it's great. The homemade pita is to die for, I always leave with an extra bag which is only about $4 because I eat it at home with everything. The hummus is delicious and the you get a good amount. I totally recommend Olives they make it fresh right there in front of you so you know what you are getting. Try it you won't be disappointed and you'll be back at least twice a week like I am."}
{"text":"Had a work lunch meeting here on a Friday afternoon, and I'm so glad my colleague suggested it! I didn't even know it existed.

As much as I love eating Mediterranean food, I have to admit that I'm awful with knowing what things are, and the menu doesn't describe much. However, our waitress did her best to answer our questions and asked the other staff when she didn't know.

We started with what I think was pita and yogurt cucumber dip (complimentary). I could've eaten a vat of the dip! The pita was much thinner than I'm used to, but good. Among the 3 of us for lunch we got lamb kabobs, hummus, grape leaves, and falafel. The only thing I didn't care for was the falafel, which had a weird spice that tasted a little like black licorice. Everything else was to die for!! My lamb kabobs were marinated in deliciousness, and the rice it came with was so light.

When we walked in, the waitress asked if we were getting food to go or eating in. Once we sat down, I realized there was a counter almost like at school where you get your tray and slide along before you pay, so it could work either way. Fantastic fast-casual Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the tabboleh salad and pork pita with fries and pop to share. The salad was good and had a bit of tang, which was refreshing. The pork in the pita was delicious. The service was good and very friendly 

I am in town to experience the catus league and spring training. I am just glad it is warm here compared to Sacramento, Ca.

We ate a late breakfast and became hungry mid-afternoon. I looked for a restaurant nearby which was reasonably price with a high rating and Olives seem to fit what we wanted. I am so glad we stopped here to eat.

My in-laws ordered the steak pita and it was too large for either to finish. But they really like the sandwich. The restaurant was very clean. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow!  This kale + quinoa salad with falafel is the best salad I've ever had anywhere!  I will eat here several more times during my trip to Phoenix, as often as possible."}
{"text":"So we went dining to the newly opened Mediterranean grill place. This place has good service and a typical middle eastern feel to it. One has got to try out the Chicken Shawarma sandwich. The fries served with the sandwich are very crispy. Also you get complementary hummus with the traditional bread while dining. The server is very polite. Cost wise, this is a $$ place. Definitely going to try out their other dishes especially the chicken kabobs from the dinner plate menu."}
{"text":"I went here on Dec. 1, 2014 after purchasing a Groupon.  I love Mediterranean food so it was on my list to try.  All the food was prepared fresh, they provided warm pleasant service and the food was good. I will definitely come back to this business."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend, I was looking for Greek food and thankfully found this place! The Gyro was delicious! Meat is really tender, the sauce is amazing and the hummus is excellent! No question...go to Olive's for tasty Greek food!"}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time and LOVED it!  We had the classic hummus, gyros, and baklava.  All the ingredients were very fresh and everything was quite delicious!  Service was great as well!   We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. The falafel is perfect and grape leaves are delicious. Great option in the area for lunch and dinner. Very affordable. Quick and friendly service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the OMG salad with gyro meat and a drink my bill was $15 plus change. After I was done they asked me if I liked it I said no and I could only find two olives in my salad   He told me they put two olives on the large salad and one olive on the small salad. The gyro meat was dry and too much dressing on salad I did not eat most of it. I would have expected more for that price. This is not a sit down restaurant you go to counter to order. The man told me I should have gotten the ceaser salad it is good."}
{"text":"Same location as former Garbanzos. Similar Mediterranean foods with greater selection,but seemingly fewer opportunities to select specific components of the meal. Also for a place called Olives, the should be at least one olive on every plate 
Overall very good."}
{"text":"We mad it over to Olives after my aspiring foodie daughter decided we would eat Mediterranean last night.  What a pleasant surprise!  The layout is a bit like Zoe's but the food is anything but.  I like Zoe's but this place is all fresh all prepared and cooked there.  

The highlights were the chicken shawarma and gyros.  I wish I could tell you about all the different offerings but we had samples of the chicken shawarma and the seasoning was amazing, so much so that 3 of our four ordered it.  I had the chicken shawarma and gyros combo so I can report the gyros was excellent as well.

Finally the house made hummus and salads were very fresh and flavorful.  

I have no complaints but if asked for suggestions I would offer real plates instead of takeout trays.  It just has a different feel to it when eating from proper plates...  it that won't keep me from returning!"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything was homemade and delicious. We loved the pita bread, light and fluffy and the falafels."}
{"text":"I'v been here twice and it's always so delicious. I just wish they were open past 8:30.... but they have the best salads, so many different hummus' and the lamb is so good. I will always come back."}
{"text":"This place is in the old storefront that used to house Garbanzo. While the inside of the restaurant looks almost identical to Garbanzo the food is different, it seemed almost more Greek than Middle Eastern.  That being said they have real shawarma and since I'm a shawarma guy I had to give it a shot. I ordered the chicken shawarma Pita and it was very good. It tasted just as you would expect a chicken shawarma would and it was big for the price.  I would have liked for it to come with some hummus but they do offer that for an additional charge.  All in all this is a solid lunch spot. I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean and was so excited to find this quick and easy order at the counter restaurant. Hubby and I ordered the gourmet cheese focaccia with steak, the gyro pita, and feta fries. The fries were good - seasoned fries right out of the fryer! The pita was a little bland and dry but hubby ate it all. I enjoyed the steak focaccia - highly recommend. Their green tea was pretty good too. With the 15% Check in discount, it was around $22. I will come return and try other items for sure!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say it folks but the food just wasn't good. The beef and chicken shawarma both were dry and tough. Not a fan. #anotheronebitesthedust!"}
{"text":"We checked in at Olives to try it out and compare against other Mediterranean restaurants we frequent. We found Olives to offer very good food in a very clean and modern setting. The ordering experience and service were both outstanding. They clearly take the extra step to be sure their food is authentic with natural flavors and not clouded with salt and other enhancers."}
{"text":"We can not review the food because after almost one hour of waiting we managed to only get 4 waters, no appetizers and two \"greek\" salads.  We received our silverware only after asking for it. We could understand the wait if it was busy but there were only 6 tables of people and 2 servers.

We had to leave as we had two kids (and adults) that were hungry and it did not appear as if we would be getting served anytime soon. Upon notifying our waitress we were leaving, we were charged $11.88 for two non Greek salads and left. 

Unfortunately we do not plan on returning anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"I, like everyone else I saw here, was lured in by the 50% off ValuPak coupon. I got the red pepper hummus and pita, and vegetarian plate (classic and cilantro jalapeño hummus, falafel, stuffed grape leaves and pita), to go. I liked that the items were marked vegetarian, but there was no vegan designation.

The food was about what I expected. The falafels were plump but not very flavorful. I liked the cilantro jalapeño hummus the best of the three. The pita was soft and thick. 

The vegetarian plate was expensive ($10.50) but the hummus and pita was reasonable ($5.95). The fries looked great, but not $3.25 great. 

One recommendation - they need to rework the order line. It seemed very confusing for people and a big crowd stood in the dining area instead of the area against the wall. A rethink/redesigned is needed!

I will probably go back if I am in the area and need a quick bite, but it wasn't good enough to make it a top destination."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean restaurant, steak and falafel pitas were excellent. Beer and wine available. Clean, good atmosphere, friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, service was good. Lots of healthy options. Two meat plate is my go to item."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and clean! Portions were ample and reasonably priced. Gyro's were great, but rice lacked flavor and was not quite done."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly service and delicious food. Clean modern ambiance.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"New Mediterranean Style Restaurant. Service was quick, servers were very friendly, place was clean with a bright atmosphere. Food was consistent, definitely Mediterranean style, think Greek/Turkish, not Middle Eastern(Israeli/Lebanese) style. Tahini was bland, as were the tomatoes and lettuce. I was disappointed with the flavor of the falafel. It was fried properly, it just did not much flavor. The shawarma was ok, nothing spectacular, it was missing that good lamb fat undertone. We were also charged to substitute tahini instead of tzatziki sauce. Would likely return to try something else in the menu."}
{"text":"4 starts for the food. 1 star for the service. It took 40 minutes for our food to arrive once we sat down. There weren't many other tables filled in the restaurant at 1:40pm on a Saturday. I would probably give this place another try, but another long wait and I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Poor choice to eat. I will start by saying food was ok. Not better then another mediterranean grill close by but it will due. I issue was with the incorrect order which then did try to fix. BUT... my biggest issue was that they charge my meal to someone else credit card. And act as if there wasn't an problem with it. I was highly disappointed in the service with this place. I would warn you to\" PAID WITH CASH AND NOT CREDIT CARD\" ."}
{"text":"Since sultan kabob house closed we've been trying to find a good spot for Mediterranean food. Now we've found it. The falafels came out hot and crispy, the lamb kabobs were seasoned very well and the beef schwarma was excellent. They have a very good roast flavor on the baba ganooj and very flavorful hummus. The staff was friendly and prices were less than zetuini grill."}
{"text":"Great little drop in casual place for Mediterranean food. Nice people. Good, fresh food. The baclava was light and not too sweet. Margarita focaccia comes with nice helpings of mozzarella, basil and tomatoes. 

The ring around PV Mall is home to many fast casual restaurants. Try Olives for something different and delicious."}
{"text":"I tried to order by the phone just now and I was on hold for seven minutes. I could hear the lady (Yasmin) at first taking an order but after she was done she never came back. I was saying hello to see if she would remember that she had a costumer waiting on the phone but nothing. Then, I heard that she started taking a new order so I ended the call. I tried calling again and all I was getting was a message saying that my call can't be completed at this time, to try again later :/ (this review is for their costumer service) 

I went to order in person just after trying to call numerous times and asked about if their phones were not working. Yasmin answered me that she was the only cashier working. She could had told me from the minute I called that I should just come in or something, not leave me on the phone waiting for seven long minutes. She seemed nice but she needs to work on being better at costumer service."}
{"text":"So my co-worker wanted to try Olive's for lunch.  It had been a long time since I'd tried them, so I agreed in hopes of finding massive improvement from my initial visit a few months back.  

I can say that it was much better- the decor, server, menu and ambiance was improved, but the taste of the basic chicken kabob I got just wasn't there.  I'm used to explosions of flavor and unusual spices in Mediterranean restaurants and the food we got today was simply very bland.  I guess the best way I can describe it would be to say that it's Mediterranean-ish, very watered down for southern American palates.  The \"house salad\" was still simply iceberg lettuce on the plate with bland Italian dressing poured over it, the pita bread wasn't even warm and the garlic sauce had very little garlic taste to it at all  :-(  None of which I would return for.  There are far better Mediterranean choices in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A really solid 3.5 ...but not quite 4 worthy. They have very quick and friendly service, the portions are a nice size, and the Falafel while far from the best I ever had, was pretty good. My favorite part was the pita itself, it tasted homemade.  They were really heavy-handed on the fry seasoning so that's an area for improvement 

Overall a good little stop for an informal/quick lunch..."}
{"text":"Walked in and we were seated immediately. I got the grilled chicken pita sandwich and I asked the server what all was in the sandwich and she told me lettuce and tomatoes. I asked if they will add onions to it. When I got the sandwich, it was good, also had a vinegar base sauce on it. Boyfriend got a side salad and the shawarma. Side salad actually made me giggle when it came out. It was all white lettuce that wasn't fully cut up. It was not fresh at all. His shawarma was soft and tender. The rice was good and flavorful. Service was ok, there wasn't a lot of people there but they did have a party table. Had to ask several times for our drinks to be refilled even though we purposely placed our drinks at the end of the table so our server can see. Not sure if we will come back. Food was ok, wasn't great."}
{"text":"Delicious mediterranean food, very good service. the owner was so sweet and brought us homemade pita chips! the hummus was phenomenal, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious,  fresh tasting ! I love this place so much! Loved the gyro and fries and the tabbouleh was delicious!!!! Love this place! Do yourselves a favor and give it a chance!"}
{"text":"The food is good but it's to expensive!!
It's they lowered their prices I would for sure be a regular. But I am not going to spend 18 dollars for one person for dinner ! I can go to o outback and get a steak for cheaper than that. The food is good but not worth it"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food. I cook Mediterranean.  Trying to waste some time because our air conditioner broke on the way back from the airport.  We were totally not expecting very much But the thyme and cheese focaccia Tasted like it was from a fine restaurant. Some subtle flavors were in there that we could name them. Maybe a brick fired oven created this?  The falafel What is the best I have had outside of my own home.  Greek salad had good well-balanced salad dressing. Ingredients were very fresh. Decent amount of feta cheese..., Service was efficient and friendly.  It's a little to go place with a nice atmosphere.  I would come back here over and over again in my trips to the airport from out of town. Thank you for an unexpected wonderful meal Olives!"}
{"text":"This place is the chaos! Busy and completely disorganized.  I was waiting for 40 minutes for a to go order and still did not get it.  Just left."}
{"text":"Thrilled to have Mediterranean in the neighborhood- super friendly service, fresh and delicious food! PS it's healthy - yay"}
{"text":"Best original Mediterranean food I have ever eaten! They make their ingredients which makes it unique. Also, the staff is very friendly and the ownership is always around working within the staff and taking care of customers. It is a must try! I do think it is a little pricey, two ppl and the bill is always close to $30 (without drinks)."}
{"text":"Had the gyro, artichoke olive hummus, and passion fruit tea. Great lunch! Staff was very kind and provided quick service. Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Garbanzo, the Mediterranean restaurant with Chipotle-style ordering that previously occupied this space. When Yelp emailed me about a new restaurant near me, I was excited to see a similar concept had taken its place!

Instead of Garbanzo's customization of a pita/bowl/plate, you order from a set menu of hummus plates, pitas, rice and protein plates, salads, or focaccia pizzas. The food is just as tasty and fairly portioned. I ordered the steak pita because it seemed to be the most well-rounded choice; I wish it came with more of the light and garlicky tzatziki sauce, but I ordered an extra of hummus on the side ($1) which covered my sauce craving. Since I work so close to this location I'll absolutely be back and try to play with more combinations to get the perfect ratio of protein, veggies, pita, and hummus."}
{"text":"They just lost a long standing customer over an expired coupon.   50% off a salad is $3.50.  We spent over $100 week there.  Service and quality have gone downhill lately anyway.  The iced tea is often not replenished.  

Very poor customer service decision to not honor a coupon.  

I'm done with this place. Judging from the number of patrons; I'm sure this place will be closing soon. They have already cut back on their hours as well."}
{"text":"So great. Meat is cooked perfectly, not over greasy or too salty. I've been twice and had a pita with fries and a dinner combo with rice. Loved both. Fries are extra crispy, which is awesome. Our first visit we ordered dinner combos to go and got a drink to wait, dinners came out in under 10 minutes. Owner brought us complimentary hummus, which was so nice. My new favorite pita joint!"}
{"text":"This is a walk in and order type of place...pretty quick to get your food out. We waited about 10 minutes. The folks behind the counter were very friendly despite the business. Glad that the place was busy during the dinner hour!

We live pretty close by and got an awesome 50% off coupon for our entire order. We both had the vegetarian platter with classic and cilantro jalapeno hummus, 3 dolmas, 3 falafels, tomatoes, cucumbers, tahini, tzatziki, and 2 pita breads. It was all soooo yummy!! The hummus and pita especially. The only thing that I thought was missing was the rice. Wish they swapped one pita for rice instead. 

They also offer focccias, salads, and falafel sandwiches...at very decent prices too! I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Really excited about this place as it is super close to home!  Everything was fresh and delicious!  First time I'm gonna stick with the simple items.  Gyro, fries, drink, baklava.

Gyro was great!  Pita was so soft and fresh.  Lots of meat - so much I had to remove some.  Tatziki sauce was delicious.  Fries are ok, they are the fries that have crispy batter on them so I didn't care for them all that much.  They were hot so that was a plus.  

CHINAMIST!  They serve good ol chinamist tea.  THANK You and don't ever go to any other kind.  

I'm looking forward to trying their steak and chicken entrees.  They seem to be a very good value for what you get!  

Super nice and keep up the great food and presence!"}
{"text":"Good portions and really good food!  Typical casual fast food setting.  They take your order from their menu and deliver to your table.  Nothing stands out other than the food was great, fast and everything was clean.  

I will definitely make it a regular lunch stop during the work week!"}
{"text":"So the food was the bomb and nice large servings. But good lord was it slow moving service. I mean I give it to the guy. He was the only one working the tables and was very nice. Luckily we weren't starving or in a rush but took forever! Hopefully this improves bc otherwise the food is great!"}
{"text":"Super fast even at lunch when I was in today.  Had the protein hummus plate w chicken and baba ganouj.   Super good"}
{"text":"Probably the best gyro I've ever had & super friendly staff. Also try the cilantro jalapeño hummus, so goood!"}
{"text":"We are here last evening. The choices are many. My husband had the Mediterranean chicken plate. Done very well. I had The cilantro jalapeño hummus. Was somewhat surprised by the small amount of hummus compared to other similar eateries. This hummus was okay but not memorable. The tzatziki sauce was excellent!  We will give it several more times to make a good decision."}
{"text":"I ordered gyros pita with fries and drink. It was $12. That's too much for fast food lunch. The gyros was good. Average size. The fries were not good. They were seasoned with a peppery-like flavor and had an unnatural texture. 

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved their plain hummus.  My mom and I came here for a quick snack, and we were impressed.  Nice atmosphere.  We liked the decor.  Cool background music too.  We shared a hummus and a baklava.  Both were excellent.  Nice soft pita.  We want to go back to try some other things.  I need to have some cilantro jalapeno hummus next!"}
{"text":"Tried Olives today and was thrilled to discover the owners also own my favorite gyro place - Chicago Gyros. We've been eating there for years and it is a staple in our eating out rotation. The food is just as fabulous at Olives. The gyro salad was great and very generous. The chicken shwarama was especially tasty as well. The food was consistent between the two locations. The cilantro jalapeño hummus is amazing! I'm very glad to know that I can get some of my favorite food when traveling in another direction. Crossing my fingers they do well in that location.  By the look of the crowd today it's already a hit!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Kept me waiting on the phone while it was off the hook for 12 minutes and never gave me update as why or what was taking so long. This is terrible not only for me but also for anyone else who would want to place an order over the phone because the lines is busy because the phone is off the hook"}
{"text":"We ordered the Hummus and Chicken and the Chicken Shawarma Plate. Both were good not great. The grilled chicken was moist and the shawarma nicely seasoned. The rice was a tad dry and needed some oomph. I did enjoy the fluffy warm Pita dipped in the Tzaziki. All in all a healthy option when dining near the mall."}
{"text":"I stopped here today and ordered  a Gyro To eat there and also a carry out of tabouli and the quinoa salad. When I left I opened the container and was disappointed in the amount of tabouli they hardly gave you any there's more Romain than tabouli for $7.50. No pita bread was included in the order which is usually included at other places. Here's a picture of the disappointing amount of tabouli. The Gyro was excellent had of meat, and the quinoa salad was good"}
{"text":"To start we order real hot tea orange pekoe. very nice waitress, you can watch them make your food for you, so... not fast but good. Real tzatziki, yummy!!!!cucumber yogurt appetizer, oh my goodness! You must order that and the grape leaves, dip grape leaves in yogurt, enjoy and your welcome for the suggestion:) I ordered lamb Kabob very good comes with rice ok on its own but I mixed it all together (lamb, onions, hot sauce, peppers and put some cucumber yogurt on top) delicious !!!!!!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour for food.......
But this review is about the food right? The \"hummus\" or whatever variant of it that they give you to start with is not good . My shawarma  was okay but I prefer \"La Shish Kabob\" if you haven't been please go. Everything there is yummy. Overall the experience I had here would not make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious and tasty fast food served by a friendly staff in a very clean restaurant. They offer generous portions and it is well priced. Have been there several times and have not been disappointed by anything that I ordered."}
{"text":"Good! Good! Good!

It's a prefect lunch spot for Mediterranean food! We were sat immediately, our server greeted us and continued to check on us throughout our dinning experience and was incredibly polite! Not to mention the food was delicious & so many choices!! 

Best tip about this place: the entrance is tucked around the building away from the main street, so parking can be a little tricky, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! This place is clean and authentic!! I think it's the best Greek place I have been to some of the other places are so greasy and gross. This was a pleasant surprise all made from scratch with good quality ingredients !!!! It's a must go if you live near here !!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and delicious. I am a hamburger and french fries kind of gal so I was very hestiant to try Olives Mediterranean Grill.  What a nice surprise to find that I enjoyed the unique food.  Salad was fresh! Restuarant was clean and staff friendly/patient while I made up my mind on what to order. Big portion sizes so you really get your money's worth."}
{"text":"There used to be a restaurant at this location called Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill that I had been to a couple of times and really liked. I don't make it out here too often but one day saw that there was now an Olives Mediterranean Grill at this location. I wasn't sure if they had changed their name or this was a different company but I decided to give it a try.

I ordered the chicken kabob plate which is my usual fare in restaurants with this type of food. I have to say I wasn't particularly impressed. The quality of ingredients was decent but the chicken was fairly flavorless and the sauce they provided was tzatziki sauce which I don't care for but there were no other options such as garlic sauce found at other restaurants. My lunch wasn't cheap either; it came to around $13-14 which wasn't a good value based on the quality or the amount of food I received.

Granted, I don't make it out near Paradise Valley Mall too often so while I preferred the restaurant that was at this location previously, it's not much of a loss."}
