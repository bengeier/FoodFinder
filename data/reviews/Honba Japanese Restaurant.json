{"text":"It's an OK restaurant but not great.  If you are looking for a quick bite in the neighbourhood, the food is not bad but don't expect it will wow you.  I called to order and asked them whether the restaurant has seafood pancake in the Korean menu, the waitress asked what's that and said no.  Guess what, when I went to pick up the take out menu, it's right on the appetizer area.  I tried a few items.  The Bibimbap is below average and so americanized.  There are salad leaves on the Bibimbap...who puts salad leaves on Bibimbap??  The sushi pizza again it's ok but not great.  The fish is all chopped up and mixed with too much mayo.  Also there is way too much crispy stuff on top."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place.  Many lunch special choices. Sushi and sashimi are really good."}
{"text":"The food was just OK and price was reasonable. I still had  a much better experience at Mi-Ne Sushi."}
{"text":"Came here with friends, was nice to see both a Korean and Japanese menu.  The atmosphere is very pleasant and the service was great.  I would like to give the restaurant 4 stars, especially because of the service but the food is only average.  I had the spicy bulgogi, friends had a beef dinner with a hondo roll.  The salad and kimchee I got were below average, bulgogi was ok but really just ok, not all that good.  Overall, it's a decent place to come and relax, just not for the food, especially not at the price."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi I've had in awhile, their lunch specials such as the bento boxes and udon are absolutely delicious and affordable. Dinner serve mostly the same food but are more expensive. The place is also clean and quiet, and their waiters are friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I always go to Honda since I work across the street from it. It never disappoint me. It is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant so it offers a wide variety of food of both. I also enjoy their lunch combo as the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"It's good but it's already been americanized, meaning all forms of cultural flavour has been sucked out so that the masses can accept it for what it is. Luckily, its better than most restaurants of the genre in the area."}
{"text":"My kids love  this restaurant.  The food is good but I don't like the decor.  The carpet is out of date and the. Restrooms need to be updated.  Its also a hassle to get into the parking lot from Wellington road if you are traveling westbound."}

{"text":"I am always reluctant to give 5 stars to many restaurants now, and that means I can`t find a better restaurant than this. But all thinks considered, I think this place deserves that ranking.  This restaurant is relatively new, and is located were the old Purple Pig used to be. From this outside this place is a little deceiving, because inside are lots of tables. Again, being an old cookhouse, I was expecting a dilapidated interior, but again, I was surprised to see a really nice decor. There is a bar lined with stools and a good mixture of tables and booths.  The waitress gave us both a Japanese and Korean menu. This is the first time I`ve experienced dual cuisine. Looking through their menus I noticed that they do have a lot of selection but their sushi menu I find expensive. The bento boxes are about $16 and 3 pieces of sushi starts at like $4, and the average special roll is about $12. Maybe I`m biased because of the AYCE downtown, but this seems like a lot.  I ordered the Chap Chae noodles (Korean) for an appetizer and a beef teriyaki bento box. Chap Chae is glass noodles mixed with vegetables in a sauce. My wife ordered a crunchy maki and avocado maki. The food was really really good. The teriyaki sauce was thick and not runny, the spring rolls were really good, and the wasabi that came with the sushi was more fluffy rather than like a paste. What made me really like the meal is the beef itself was tender and not fatty. Usually the beef laced with nasty fat, but not this one. Deelicious.  My wife also liked her sushi a lot as well. The sushi was a little different because crunchy maki is usually tempura bits rolled on the inside. This time the tempura bits were on the outside. The avocado was really  ripe as well.  Other than being a little overpriced, that is not enough to remove the 5th star off my rating. If you are in Aurora and have a hankering for some sushi check this place out."}
