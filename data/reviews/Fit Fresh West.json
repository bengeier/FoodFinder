{"text":"Have done the cleanse twice now with tremendous benefits. The meals are delicious and filling. The green tea cake with protein whip is my favorite.  Three meals a day for a full week. Good variety and your choice of proteins. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very trendy and comfortable cafe located in the Princeton Club. You can enter from inside the Princeton Club or the exterior of the building. It's more expensive than I expected but everything appears to be fresh and healthy! I'd probably only go back if I was in a time crunch."}
{"text":"Great food post workout at the gym. Healthy too ! Fresh food, friendly staff and clean. Added a good coffee also."}
