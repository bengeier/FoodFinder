{"text":"I have only been here once, but this is the start of a long and happy relationship. I had the chicken pot pie, I wanted to start with the staple. It was awesome. I only wish it were bigger so I could eat more of it.   Also had the mac and cheese and it had that consistency of being made with REAL cheese. Not that cheese product nonsense you get everywhere else. If was delicious.  Mom also gave me a free sample of caramelized croissant, which was also delectable. OH, and the lemonade! I am picky about my lemonade, people always make it too sweet, but this fresh squeezed refreshment was a refreshing twist on that expectation. I can't wait to see what the peach tea is all about! And the shepherd's pie and some of the other sides... trying not to break my eat out once a week rule!"}
{"text":"Carmalized croissants are awesome!!  Just a little place but people are super friendly and welcoming. I'm hoping that they will see this review and send me their croissant recipe since I live in the Chicago area. A girl could hope."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Squarz for the past couple of years and was super excited when they opened up a cafe near where I live in Tempe.  I first heard about them through some friends who found them at local farmers markets and are regular customers and raved about the pies. My favorites have been the spinach and feta pie, the chicken pot pie, and especially the shepard's pie, which reminds me of tasty pies I had when travelling in England and Australia. I'm a huge sucker for savory pies, especially with the wonderful flaky crust that Squarz has. The croissants are also excellent with the perfect flaky texture and buttery flavor that can be so hard to find!  The pies change seasonally, based on ingredients that are available during that season, so there is usually something new to try in addition to the regular rotation of pies. There are also desserts available, although the focus is definitely on the savory side.   The new cafe is cute and intimate and has a variety of fresh salads and warm pies which is perfect for a quick lunch. I haven't tried the curry pies yet but those are next on the list, I know people who have had them really love them!"}
{"text":"I stopped by their Tempe location and the manager/owner had just made some zucchini Squarz. I took home a package of the frozen zucchini ones and a package of the feta cheese and spinach. Yum! Each one is only 200 calories so with a salad it makes a nice lunch. I am  a big fan of the Cornish pasties, too, but this dough is lighter and more like filo dough which is especially nice in summer when you want lighter food.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!!! Absolutely love this place. Amazing friendly service and the food is just like mom use to make! Keep it uobb"}
{"text":"Originally from Europe and I never seem to find a place that really makes baked goods that compare to it... Until I came to this lovely place. Very kind people who operate it and eager to engage in conversations with a smile. Now I'll be it, I only had the cinnamon croissant roll but it was delicious. Served on a hot plate with a fork and knife so there's no mess and leaves a warm filling sensation inside when done. It's no bakery like you'd fined in Belgium or France but it's close, call it an American touch to it if you will. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place with the most pleasant and polite staff - and delicious food, we had a variety of pies and shared their signature croissant for dessert.  I have 3 very small suggestions - less spice in the gourmet mac and cheese, less salt in the croissant and please, please, please open at the weekend, I drove all the way out there and you were closed - on a Saturday - at lunchtime.  I don't recommend many places - but I'm recommending this one."}
{"text":"Oh boy! THE BEST Shepherd's Pie any muggle ever made, it puts your Granny's great great grandmother's recipe to shame, just kidding! I'm sure she's a great cook :)  But, back to the Pie... You could taste the fragrant butter on every flake and every bite,  definitely quality butter. Filling was perfectly baked, juicy and fresh.  About the service,  Staff was way more than friendly; when was the last time you eat at an establishment and given real heavy weight silverware and shiny ceramic plates sans scratches either from wears or being in dishwasher too many time?   About mom n popping,  ( I totally just made up that phrase) The owner is super attentive, kind and friendly, all the more reason you should go and visit this place!   Last but not least,  They use filtered water for their drinks, served it in thick Mason jars, no less.  To me, these say they are clean, they care about their pies, and clients.  Mmmm... So why are you still reading this, muggles? Go get yourself a pie already!!!"}
{"text":"Read reviews and was looking for something interesting.  Maybe we hit a bad day.  First and most the puff pastry dough was very heavy and greasy.  Soaked through a napkin.  Very little pot pie filling in the heavy square sandwich shaped square, but it tasted nice. Ate the filling and not much of the rest. Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"These pies are really yummy, they bake up in no time at all so they make an easy quick meal for people on the go. Plus, the best part - no thawing needed! A really tasty, flaky crusted all natural alternative to hot pockets with a much much larger variety of types. Only thing I would add is a variety pack or a sampler because for new customers they might not want to commit to a whole bag of one pie type."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried it yet, then you must!  We have ordered through them twice for office lunches and it has been fantastic both times.  Never one complaint, and I'm not sure why but even people in the area seem to not know about it yet.  Great comfort food, and great for a group.  So, so good!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Got these with a LivingSocial deal.  Bought chicken & mushroom and spinach & feta. I cooked one each and after tasting them I threw away the remaining 14. Yup, not even worth using the electricity to cook the remaining pies.  Both the chicken and the spinach pies had an off taste. The crust was nice and flaky but incredibly greasy.  I love dill butt the spinach and feta tasted more like an actual dill pickle than an nice herby dill.   The mushroom and chicken had little to no chicken and an almost paste like filing.  Too bad because the idea of little pies was a good one."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and the service is great.  The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable and the service is quick. Everything tasted fresh and good. I wish there was more room for bugger parties.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"In town for a week and have already been twice. Super friendly service and delicious food at a good price. We got the chicken pot pie, which was done perfectly with flaky crust and lots of veggies. On another occasion we treated ourselves to a chocolate croissant and coffee. Best coffee we've had in tempe. Do yourself a favor and support this awesome business, I hope they are around for a long time."}
{"text":"The hype was so accurate. I keep making excuses for skipping breakfast and just go back here. Amazing owner, amazing place."}
{"text":"This place is so good! We tried the chicken and mushroom pie and the turkey sandwich and they were fantastic! We also ordered the cinnamon roll croissant and because we waited so long they gave us a free lemon croissant. Definitely will be back, but next time we will call it in :)."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. My friend and I ordered chicken pot pie and prosciutto sandwich. When my friend and I talked we r gonna share, the gentleman did half-half on our plate, I never have same experience in the other places. And the food is so delicious. Chicken pot pie is slightly different than what I have before, it doesn't have smashed potato inside which is really good. And caramelized croissant is another must try, it is so good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Squarz! I have been buying at the Roadrunner Farmer's Market for awhile now and I'm so excited to see they have an actual cafe now! The Lentil Curry and Spinach & Feta are my favorites!"}
{"text":"The food here was yummy!  The service was wonderful.  All around a great place to get food.  Crispy, buttery crust on the chicken pot pie and the filling was tasty too, even if different than I expected.  The prosciutto sandwich was larger than expected and had a tangy balsamic vinegar sauce that really set the sandwich apart from the norm.  The chocolate croissant was delicious and perfect for sharing.  We are already deciding on what to try the next time we go here and there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Very chill place to go for lunch! The puff pastry they use is super buttery and flaky, and I would totally order the chicken and mushroom again. Very nice people here!"}
{"text":"Happy FriYAY, had to swing by for lunch as was craving something savory and sweet. Squarz is the best homemade local bakery offering delicate croissants and savory sandwich croissants and pot pies to make you forget any of those chain store bakeries. Come on down to south Tempe to find them on weekdays only as they pop up around town at various farmers markets on weekends."}
{"text":"Hey this place is really cool! We got the chicken pot pie and the shepherds pie. Both were ver tasty and well... Square. There was tons of flavor in every bite. The homemade lemonade was terrific! The owner was super friendly and eager to share his vision with us. This is a fine business!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! Discovered Squarz at a local farmers market and return again and again to find perfection. Their assorted tasty pastries are a family favorite. We LOVE their BBQ, Shepherds pie and apple pastries.  Support this mom and pop business and shop local..."}
{"text":"Best pies around. Super friendly owners, we order the savory ones and they gave us a sweet one to try. Really good."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Couldn't ask for a better experience! Hands down some of best most creative food I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying, will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"I used Squarz for a catering order for a group of 25.  I received such positive feedback on the food (one of the \"Top 5\" for my picky group) and I have to say that the service was just as amazing as the food.  Setup, presentation, courtesy during delivery, FOOD -- everything was top notch.  Will be making a visit to the cafe for lunch and/or dinner with my family soon."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found these people and THEY DELIVER! :D They are super friendly and nice, plus the food is delicious."}
{"text":"So delicious. We tried the chicken pot pie, the shepherds pie, the spinach and feta pie, the bacon and cheese pie and the mac & cheese. Everything was excellent!  the watermelon which comes with the pies was fresh and delicious. The owners are phenomenal. These pastries come from New Zealand and South Africa."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place!!!  My daughter and I went for a quick lunch today and could not have been happier!!!  We both had the chicken pot pie which came with a side of chips or fruit and a drink.  I had the homemade lemonade, and it was great.  The chicken pot pies were soooooo good!!!  Flaky crust and an incredibly tasty chicken filling.  I love me some chicken pot pie, and these did not disappoint.  Super friendly people who took the time to explain the menu to us.  I think they are going to need more tables and chairs because I can see this place becoming a real hot spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered: Chocolate croissant  Caramelized croissant Cinnamon roll croissant  Pros: The caramelized croissant was delicious. Both hubby and I loved it...we didn't share it with our 2 year old so not sure a kids opinion! It was flakeypp and had a bit of a crunch to it all while being soft and buttery inside. It was perfection.  The cinnamon roll croissant was enjoyed by my 2 year old but was a bit on the sweet side for me. I like it enough and would have been happy about it but next to the caramelized croissant it was definitely junior varsity. My daughter loved it and wanted more :) The girl who worked there was very pleasant. We switched from a to go order to a dine in and she was happy to accommodate our needs.   Cons: The chocolate croissant wasn't anything special. I didn't enjoy the chocolate inside and my daughter wasn't all that impressed either.  It didn't feel like a bakery and doesn't  have a bakery smell. There is  no display case to see what you are ordering and everything is heated up when ordered. They do have a frozen menu and so it made me feel like it is just frozen food made to order. Maybe not though!!!! It had that feel to me though. Maybe being from seattle, I am used to a bakery/coffee shop with a hipster feel and this just isn't that.....but definitely worth a try!   Honest....get the caramelized croissant and be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Over rated and costly... Food was bland both times I went. What is a cool concept, could be much more."}
{"text":"My, oh my...  I had happily tried their savory pies one Sunday at the Ahwatukee farmers market.  Little did I know that when I looked on Yelp for \"cheap eats\" that this was the same company.    Do yourself a favor - RUN, DON'T WALK to this place.  Super friendly staff, delicious food.  I got the Shepherd's pie with a side of mac and cheese.  I had to summon my all strength to *not* lick the container the mac and cheese came in (I was at work, after all).  Shepherd's pie was delicious, with a nice hint of rosemary. It may be dangerous that this place is so close to my work - so good, and so inexpensive for the quality and amount of food you get!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I always drive by this place and I finally decided to take a detour to my destination and buy a few things from here to take to my friends house. Ordered a few sweet croissants and wow, why didn't I come here sooner. I got the lemon, chocolate and cinnamon croissants, all three did not disappoint"}
{"text":"I became intimately acquainted.... no, I should say obsessed... with the caramelized croissants at the Farmer's Market at Roadrunner Park... thank you for being there!  It gives me a reason to get my butt out of bed EARLY on a Saturday morning and walk the mile to the market because I know you'll be there!!!  These things are so messy, flakey, sticky & sweet that I just cannot imagine a week going by without having one!!!!  Someday I'll drive to Tempe to see the store, but for now... it's my weekly indulgence!!  How did it start?  Just a simple sample.  truly love at first bite!!"}
{"text":"OMG! These are amazing! We got the pulled pork and breakfast one, Will definitely be going back for more of these at RoadRunner Park Sat Market.  They are so flakey and the fillings are incredible!"}
{"text":"It's so rare to walk into a place and the whole staff is happy with amazing friendly service. That happiness transfers to the food. I had the happiest tasting chocolate croissant. The Mac n cheese will cure road rage. I can't wait to try the pies. I bet they are better than therapy.  I live in east Phoenix and won't mind the drive at all. The food is that good. Steven and his staff are golden."}
{"text":"Very cute place ! I had the chocolate croissant, yum!!! Can't wait to go back to try other delicious menu items!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I had the spinach and feta pie and mac and cheese, which was maybe the best mac and cheese I've ever had. The store is cute, service is awesome and they sell delicious tiny frozen pies to go."}
{"text":"I found Squarz on Grubhub and was just happy to have another option on there that wasn't chinese or mexican. It ended up being a great choice! I got the shepherds pie, the spinach and feta pie and the pasta salad. Everything was delicious and I'll definitely order from, or go there, again!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, dinner, or just a snack. They sell ready-to-eat sweet and savory pastries, as well as frozen ones that you can take home and pop in the oven or microwave for a quick and tasty meal. Pretty inexpensive, and I think everything is made on site. Also, the owner and his parents, (who are frequently there helping out) are delightful!  I don't know the schedule, but they also regularly have booths at several farmers markets around the Valley."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Delicious and highly recommended. I could eat Squarz everyday, especially with their great soup."}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING! My first time trying them and I think I found a new favorite spot. Got it delivered and from the moment they answered the phone to take my order to the moment the food was brought to my job, I was impressed the whole time! The guy was super nice, even thanked me for supporting the business. Food was hot, delicious and not pricey for delivery. I ordered the special with chicken pot pie and spinach and feta with mac and cheese and a peach tartlet. Everything was great! Thank you, Squarz, I'll be ordering again!"}
{"text":"First of all the owner and baker is super sweet and adorable. He seems truly passionate about food.  I love the pot pie idea. I can't think of another place that focuses on pot pies in the area. There's a pasty place, but not chicken pot pie! You can purchased square-shaped baked pot pies or you can even take home frozen, unbaked pot pies to eat at home. They use a nice flaky pastry instead of the typical pie pastry.  My family had the next few days' meals planned out, so I didn't get a chance to buy pre-baked ones. We purchased the raw, frozen ones and baked them up ourselves in a toaster oven a few days later for brunch. I think we almost tried every single flavor. I enjoyed the pepperoni and the chicken pot pies. We tried both the large and small sizes and I prefer the larger pot pies.  The highlight of the meal were the Kouign-amann pastries we had for dessert. I love love croissants so I was excited to try these beautiful creations. They are somewhat similar to puff pastry, but had layers of sugar are folded in. The sugar caramelizes and it's awesome. I've tried quite a few in San Francisco and Squarz' version is just as good.   Inside Squarz, there isn't a ton of seating, but there were at least two small tables of two and three seats at the bar facing the window.  I needed to use the restroom and he was nice enough to let me use what seemed like an employee only bathroom. I walked all the way through one side of the kitchen to the very back. I love professional kitchens, so I couldn't help spy on what they were up to. The kitchen seemed really clean and it was cool to see an enormous pot of chicken pot pie filling being stirred.  I hope Squarz' customer service continues to be great because I've been recommending this place to family and friends who live in Arizona. Buy a bunch of different pot pies for dinner or buy the frozen ones for a tasty and quick meal when you're too busy to cook!"}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pie, Mac and Cheese, and Croissant Cinnamon Roll were all absolutely amazing. I expected great things from the Reviews, and i was blown away. It was beyond expectations."}
{"text":"Everything is made as squares. The croissant was buttery and tasty. I also tried one of the spinach pies, not as flavorful, but still good! Staff is helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing we ordered the lentil square as well as the spinach and feta square and they both were amazing    We also ordered the apple pie which was warm and amazing"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time today. We ordered chicken pot pie, macaroni and cheese, lemonade and got the apple pie and a caramelized croissant. Everything was amazing and the service was great as well. The men working there were friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place based on their Yelp reviews.  We walked in and were greeted immediately.  Since this was our first time, she explained that everything on the menu is made in house and how her son started the business in Farmers' Markets.  My husband ordered the Spinach & Feta and I ordered the Chicken & Mushroom.  We were pleasantly surprised!  First of all, if you like phyllo dough like I do, you'll love Squarz!  (I don't think it is phyllo dough, but the crust was light and flaky just like it.)   The spinach one tasted very similar to a spanikopita too.  There was just the right amount of seasoning for both, no flavor was too intense.    We ended up also ordering from the bakery selection - the  Kouign Amann and the Cinnamon Roll.  I thought I would just eat a bite or two, but we ended up eating all of it in one sitting because it tasted so good!  The Kouign Amann tasted similar to a Filipino treat called ensaymada except without the cheese.  (Ensaymada is a sweet bread with butter, sugar, and cheese.)  The Cinnamon Roll was very sweet and tasty.  We left our first visit at Squarz very satisfied!  After running a few errands, we decided to come back to buy their frozen variety pack.  It took about 20 minutes in the oven and they came out flaky and perfect!  I made the Chicken & Mushroom and the Pumpkin ones for dinner, and the kids loved it!  Even my picky eater asked for seconds, which is most surprising!  Needless to say, Squarz will definitely be added to our rotation for quick bites!"}
{"text":"The best pie i ever had....period. i tried their chicken mushroom pie and it was the best.  The place itself is a hidden gem around the shops on SE corner of rural and Elliot. its a small contemporary, very neat and elegant place.  They have a good section of pies and other sandwiches. I also tried their tomato basil soup which was good.  I would highly recommend this place over and over again"}
{"text":"Everyone should try this place out.  i went there today for Lunch with a friend.   First time there.  I not only judge a restaurant by its food, but also the service and how clean the establishment is.   Let me say.. Service is top notch and this place is super clean.   Not to mention the food.  I purchased the Sheppard's Pie and my friend got the Chicken and Mushroom.   Deadly !  Needless to say, I just placed an order for takeout tonight.      this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I went about two months back and never had written a review, until I saw Ian's review down below and felt I should leave something.  I also got the chicken pot pie, mac n cheese, and a lemonade, all of which I found to be amazing.  My brother had the mac n cheese himself, and we agreed it was probably top 10 (non fine dining) mac n cheeses we could remember.    The pot pie was fresh and tasted home made, but don't go there thinking you're going to receive a traditional pot pie (think more of a casserole filling inside a flaky crust).    After our meal, we were brought out two free caramelized dessert croissants that were just fantastic, and I will gladly pay next time.  Their food stands on its own merits, but the customer service is just unbeatable compared to any other small business eatery that I have frequented in the past few years."}
{"text":"Best croissants ever! We tried the carmelized croissant, lemon croissant, turkey and Swiss sandwich and chicken and mushroom sandwich. They were all superb. The croissants are flaky, crispy, perfectly browned outside and soft and light inside. I may never eat regular bread again!    Also the service was excellent. They are very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Everything here is so square.  Cute little edible squares.  And it was quite yummilicious for the most part.  Squarz is square!"}
{"text":"Best potpie ever!!! Had chicken and a cinnamon for desert. Also had a peach lemonade. Phenomenal will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch all the time. The Shepard's pie is so tasty! The dough is so flaky and the filling is delicious and well flavored. BONUS: you can take some frozen ones home to enjoy later. One warning, only two tables and a small counter inside."}
{"text":"Tried them again today. I had it delivered, food arrived with a smile, hot and delicious. What more could you ask for. Will definitely be eating here again!!!   They are awesome! Their customer service is top notch. They listen to their customers and make changes. They now make sure some one is in the store at all times."}
{"text":"Had their chicken puff pastry pie today at the Realta Pass Sunday farmer's market.  Wow!  So yummy that my wife bought several.  It tasted like just about the best chicken pot pie ever but wrapped in a flakey, buttery turnover.  Next time I'll try a lentil pie and the steak & potatoes one."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see them at the City North Farmer's Market.  I bought the Bbq Pork single pies and the Steak Fajita.  I had a taste of the apple one. YUM!  These are awesome options when the hubby is out of town or if you have people show up suddenly.  Quick salad and a little pie, ta da! lunch. As a matter of fact, I am going to cook a few for a brunch am throwing next week.  They are so flaky and buttery delicious.  Can't wait to try other flavors."}
{"text":"I went there today with my wife after having seen this place in yelp.  So far we've only had the caramelized croissant and the shepherds pie but I can tell from the quality of the pastry that pretty much everything they have there is going to be great. We brought some more varieties of Croissants home which will try later. we will be back many times to work our way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"First time we tried it and my girls and I love the place. The cinnamon roll is to die for. We tried the Shepherd's pie, chicken pie and chicken & mushroom pie and all three were fabulous. The service was A+ as well."}
{"text":"Yum!! Fresh, original and delicious. I think one of the only feedback is that there is not a ton of space to eat there so it seems like you would most likely want to take the food to go."}
{"text":"I don't usually write 5* reviews from my bed while I'm still wiping croissant crumbs off my rack, after just one delivery \"visit\" but we live in strange times, and today was a stressful day. People decompress in different ways: mine was to check the Yelp! app to see if Squarz delivered, because I was dreaming about Joyce W's pictures from the other day.   So, as I sit here watching the end of \"Titanic\" on Lifetime, still hating Rose because she literally let go of Jack right after saying \"I'll never let go,\" I decided to upload my pics and drop a quick review. Originally I ordered through Eat24, and the owner called to say they were out of cinnamon roll croissants; as he rattled off alternatives I remembered Joyce's picture of the creme brûlée croissant and chose that instead. I also ordered: spinach & feta, shepherds, and chicken pot pies, the prosciutto, mozzarella & fig sandwich, with fresh fruit, mac & cheese with bacon and creamy garlic mashed potato sides, and the creamy tomato soup. Annnd a kouign-amann and the aforementioned creme brûlée...Don't judge me, people, today sucked!   Anyway, all of the above arrived quickly, and piping hot. The owner delivered it himself, and told Scott he threw in a \"couple (three!) of (chocolate) croissants because we were out of cinnamon.\" Super nice and appreciated. Everything was delicious, I took a quick bite of the spinach and feta pie, then literally tore open the dessert container to taste the caramelized kouign-amman, Scott's mouth was agape at my ferocity, ha! It.is.perfection. So, naturally I had to try the creme brûlée before eating my dinner: the top layer shattered, the croissant was flaky, and the pastry cream between layers took it to another level of dessert Nirvana. I did eventually taste my sandwich, which was a savory-sweet balance I loved, the soup, and the sides. Each item was truly noteworthy, Scott enjoyed the savory pies and desserts.   We are going back. I don't care if I have to live on the stairmaster, and drag my old butt to Pump more often, this is worth it. I'm already impressed with the customer service, and the food is phenomenal. You can taste the love in the products!   Now excuse me while I go into a carb coma..."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this place! First off, my family use to own a restaurant so I usually set my standards for restaurants pretty high. I can say that this place absolutely exceeded every expectation and standard! The food is DELICIOUS. It's warm and fresh, and the croissant is beyond flakey and it melts in your mouth!! As far as the owner goes, I have never recieve such amazing customer service. You can tell he has a passion for what he does, and that he genuinely loves his customers and appreciates them! I can't wait to come back again next week!!! You have to try this place. The chicken pot pie is amazing, and the shepherd's pie....pure HEAVEN! Fresh squeezed lemonade is a delicious touch, as well!"}
{"text":"Oh my good gawd. I was Needing a  sugar fix so I thought I'd stop in. Hot damn! YUM! Had that Caramelized deliciousness and a cup of coffee. Wow. My tastebuds may be happy but my thighs are not! Haha  I must come back to try the others."}
{"text":"Dough perfection! We had several of the sweet confections, lemon, chocolate, cinnamon roll and the carmelized and they did not disappoint! We even took some to go and two days after purchase they still amazed! We live in Tucson and I am considering driving up just for a fix of these. Next time we go we will also try some of the meat filled options."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, it's just a small place, but the service was definitely great. Loved the sandwiches and the apple pie was excellent, crust was flaky and buttery! Going to have to go back to try some more."}
{"text":"Ordered Delivery. Delivery was fast and the driver was very nice.  I had the Shepard pie.  Husband had the chicken mushroom.  Both were Really good they were crisp, flaky and just perfect. I will order again!"}
{"text":"Overall I would give a 3.3 (rounded down to 3)  I had the prosciutto and Italian cheese sandwich was quite good and filling. Had about 1/2 lb of prosciutto on it and was toasted well on a flakey croissant. (3.5)  I had the lemonade which was very sugary and they put a ton of ice in it to the point I could barely push in my straw. It was good but until the ice started to melt and water it down it was a little overpowering. (3)  The cinabun croissant was good and the cream cheese icing was delicious (3.5)  Service was good though there was no one else there so it is hard to say how the service would be if it was busy. (3)"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is the best for all the reasons!  If you like symmetry in your life along with tasty goodness, then you have to swing by SQUARZ. I never knew this place existed until my husband was looking up what was around us. We heard pies and we were sold.  It's in a strip mall and the shop space is small but perfect for what they got. There are different pies from savory to sweet to help appeal everyone's taste buds. The owner is friendly, passionate and one of the most interesting people I have met. He has some world travels under his belt and brought his expertise to our little city.   We decided to get a variety of items from their frozen variety packs of pie to take home. They have preselected pies in the surprise bag that you can choose. If you take them home, it takes 20 minutes to bake but your house will smell like perfection. I got the prosciutto sandwich and seriously it was AMAZING. It was still warm when I got home and the pie like-crust was just the right amount of flaky. We got it to go and the owner felt sad I didn't have a drink so he threw one in on the house.  Their customer service is amazing and the food matches their amazing customer service skills. I'll be back soon, I promise :)"}
{"text":"Met the owner/baker today when I went in to grab lunch for the first time; and even though he was clearly having a rough day, he was super nice and polite.  Got the chicken pot pie and the chicken and mushroom.  Both AMAZING.  I have to say I really appreciate the way they loosely wrap them in aluminum foil and then put them in a paper pocket.  I was a little worried that by the time I got back to my office they would only be lukewarm, but they were still piping hot, and since they weren't sealed in tightly, they weren't soggy at all.    These flaky, delicious pastries were probably some of the best savory puff pastry I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent pot pies and pastries.   The owner is amazing.  He really knows how to take great care of his customers.   Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  A real gem in Tempe.  We had chicken and mushroom pie and a prosciutto and fig pie.  Both were delicious....perfectly flaky crust and each filling very tasty.  The combination of prosciutto and fig was genius.  The lemon croissant was exceptional.  No disappointments."}
{"text":"My Shepard pie square was fresh and delicious. Staff exeeded expectations and was very helpful."}
{"text":"I thoroughly loved my meal. Everything I ordered was phenomenal. I had the Spinach Feta, mac n cheese and a Salad. Wow! I'm from New Orleans and I  have so much trouble finding food in Arizona that has Flavor! I will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"I am at a loss on those 119 5 star comments. Service was good. Food was not even 1 star. No place to sit either"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  They have the best lemonade I would stop just to get the lemonade but then the pies are fantastic as well as the desserts. It is a great little gem if you are looking for great food."}
{"text":"Squarz has been growing on me ... I have to upgrade the rating because I love the Turkey/Swiss sandwich!! ;)  It definitely melts in your mouth! I would highly recommend it to all"}
{"text":"Went in about a week ago now and wow! This place is so yummy. The Caramelized croissants are like crack. Comfort food galore amazing square pies and the Mac and cheese is delicious! Got to meet the owner on our visit and he is very friendly and amazing customer service. All around great place!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients you can taste and feel good about. It was so good I had to take some home for later. I'm so happy I checked this place out, definitely a new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"If there is a heaven it smells like fresh baked goods.   This place smells awesome.  Chicken pot pie pastry was tasty. The cinnamon roll for dessert will leave me wondering when I can go back and get another.  Place is super small, but the food and owners are great."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot. The meat pies are delicious. The croissant cinnamon rolls absolute heaven. There's nothing better in this world than the chicken pot pie. The staff and owner are super friendly. Just an all around great place to grab a bite. We've been every day since we found the place! Saturday and Sunday they are closed but are at the Farmers Market! Meat pies for life!"}
{"text":"Just had a peach tart and it was good. Haven't been back to try any of the savoury pies."}
{"text":"Great service. Feels like family.  Delicious food.  I had the shepherd's pie and carmelized croissant, which was delicious. Not sure I could order anything different next time...since it was so good. Can't believe I hadn't seen them until today.  I drive past this intersection all the time on my way to work."}
{"text":"The first time I've ever had something from here was when the bf brought me a kouign amann after work (the best!). And it was freaking delicious! I've had kouign amanns before in San Francisco where pastries are all the rage, and it's definitely comparable. It's hard to go wrong with a caramelized pastry with flaky layers. *insert heart eye emoji*   I was randomly having a craving for mac and cheese for lunch and when I yelped it Squarz was the first thing that came up under the search results. So I decided to pre-order a few things from their website to pick up.   - Mac n Cheese: You can add bacon to this for 0.50 cents but it honestly doesn't need it. The small size is perfect as a side since it's so rich. Definitely satisfied the craving.  - Side Salad: I tried to get some greens to make myself feel less guilty about the mac n cheese. They actually ended up comping this for me since apparently it comes with other veggies such as cucumbers that they ran out of. Works for me!  - Turkey, swiss, and garlic aioli squaressant sandwich: Pretty self-explanatory. The butter croissant bun was delicious and super flaky. Definitely the star ingredient.  - Fresh squeezed lemonade: Really good! They give it to you in a huge cup too. Satisfies that sweet tooth. - Kouign Amann: Yep, got another one. It might seem a bit pricey since it's $4 for one, but IT IS SO WORTH IT. Don't leave without getting one. Even though I was sooo full from trying a little bit of everything, I for sure had room to eat this. I repeat, CARAMELIZED croissant. How can that not be good???  They make ordering online really easy since their menu is displayed all on one easy-to-read page with photos. I really want to try one of their pies next time since that's what most people seem to get. Plus I have high expectations since they seem to do that flaky/delicious part of their bread so well.   And if possible try to get your items take out since the store is reeeeeal small. You walk in and the counter is right there. It's basically a long hallway. They do have very limited seating (I think a couple inside and a few outside). Luckily it wasn't too busy when I stopped by so it is possible to eat there if you need to. Everyone there was very nice as well!"}
{"text":"The chicken and mushroom pie was heavenly! The crust fresh and flaky. Usually I leave the edges on a pie, but this time, NOPE! The cinnamon bun was delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Great food nice people! We just kept ordering stuff that I am sure the owner was overwhelmed by the five us entering his establishment. If your in the area you should definitely come in. Tips no restroom so don't get too comfortable. It's great to get to go orders but we stayed there too smell the goodness. The prosciutto and Italian cheese is by far my favorite where the wife and kids love the chicken pot pie and Cesar Salad. The spinach and feta is also the bomb!! Go and ordering something you will love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had two types of savory pies. Food was OK. What they call a Sheppard's pie is actually cottage pie, as it is made with beef not lamb. Tasted more like stew in filo dough than a meat pie. Can't help but compare the food to Cornish Pasty co...to which this place cannot even hold a candle.   Highlight of the meal was the service. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am pretty much obsessed with pot pie, so I was excited to find this place. The food was great. The chicken pot pie was better than I hoped for! Reasonably priced, a little small (only because it was so good, I wanted like 10 more ), but big on flavor. I was worried it would be dry, but there was a perfect proportion of pastry to meat to veggies to gravy. My kids had chicken pot pies, mac & cheese, fruit and lemonade, and they happily devoured it all.  The man taking our order (assuming he is an owner) asked my daughter about herself and she was excited to tell him it was her birthday. When the food was ready, he surprised us with a birthday dessert for her. He seriously has no idea how much I appreciated that - it made my daughter feel SO special! She is such a sweet girl and it made her day to have a stranger do something thoughtful for her. He was also asking me how he could make the store more kid friendly, and seemed to genuinely care about the overall enjoyment of his customers. We couldn't be happier to find delicious, reasonably-priced, homemade food, along with wonderful customer service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a must go place for breakfast and lunch. The detail in the bakery items, the flavors, the selection give you plenty of options including options to take some home and bake them yourself. The croissants and pies are exquisite and so flakey. Order the prosciutto and fig sandwich! They have a wide variety and great option for catering! Love it!"}
{"text":"So tasty and deceptively filling! Chicken mushroom pie was on point, flakey and rich. The caramelized croissant was great. I also enjoyed the very dense parm mashed potatoes. Note: one small side of these mashed delights is plenty for two. Family staff was fantastic and welcoming. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I tried this out for lunch based on the yelp reviews. I can confirm everything that has been said. The staff is very friendly and the food both sweet and savory is delicious. I look forward to going back and trying other selections. I had the chicken pot pie and the caramelized croissant today. Added plus is free refills on the lemonade! I was worried that such a great reviewed place would be busy, but it was not...which is really a shame as it should be busy all the time!"}
{"text":"Love supporting small businesses and I'm so glad I found this little place to do so!  Food is delicious, I tried a little.of everything and these pastries are on point.  I enjoyed it all, even the mac and cheese!  The owner is a sweetheart as well and was there working alone on a Friday night! That's some great commitment and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"OMG is the sum of the review. I saw Squarz at a farmers market for the first time this year. I didn't get to try their food but it looked amazing. Then I just forgot to go even though they're down the street from me. I went to another farmers market and who did I see again, Squarz. This time I tried a pie. I absolutely love puff pastry and they had so many too choose from. A couple weeks later I was reminded by my friend who went with me to the market, to go to squarz. I wish i would have walked out with more. So good. Amazing and super friendly staff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and it was such a pleasant experience! I got the chicken & mushroom pie, my bf got the carmelized croissant and my daughter had the mac & cheese. I loved the flavor of my pie! It was so savory and the actual dough was soft and flaky. My daughter enjoyed her mac & cheese and my bf liked his sweet treat as well! The owner was so nice and accommodating! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding, simply put. Scaled down menu provides only perfected recipes. 2nd time here in so many days and I am truly impressed with the quality. The shepherd's pie is unsurpassed. Do yourself a favour and try this joint and support local non corp biz."}
{"text":"I saw this place a few days ago as I was looking for a good place to celebrate PI day, but time got away and I wasn't able to make it.  This morning on my drive in to work their name came up on the radio and I knew that it was destiny that I eat here.  I came with a group of 8 people thinking we could sit and enjoy a nice lunch together.  As we walked up we notice how small the building was and our plans quickly changed.    Walking in we could immediately smell the delicious food being cooked in the back.  We placed our orders and the man was nice enough he seemed overwhelmed and frazzled at how many people had stopped by this afternoon.  He did advise that it would take a while for the food as they weren't prepared.  We enjoyed the weather and he offered lemonade while we waited.   I ordered the turkey and Swiss and was very happy with my selection, because it was amazing.  It was not your typical sandwich the bread made it. The mac and cheese was good but not fantastic. I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor.  I also ordered an apple pie which was good but so small and not nearly enough.  The chocolate croissant was good but again not fantastic.  I had a bite of someone's Shepards pie and it was underwhelming as well.  Someone in our party ordered a feta and spinach pie but got chicken and mushrooms.    I think it was a good place but not worth all the hype.  I will be back for another sandwich but I definitely will order ahead and save my money and not order anything extra"}
{"text":"What a good experience. They have the simplest menu, with the best ingredients. I ordered the prosciutto & mozzarella, the Mac and cheese, and the watermelon on the side (I've never seen that before, better than chips). It was even better than expected because they gave me a cinnamon roll for waiting! It was fast so I think they had extra. Either way, I'm coming back for the pies next time."}
{"text":"I bought into the yelp hype, and it was 100% justified. Not only is the food delicious but the staff is unbelievably friendly and pleasant. I would eat here again for that reason alone.   I'm a big eater, had just finished a solid gym session, and was hangry. When I walked in and looked at the pies I was slightly concerned about the size, which resulted in me ordering the combo. However. After finishing my pie alone I was STUFFED. I don't know how they make those delicious morsels so dense, but they are sooooo filling!! I had finish my mac and cheese regardless of how full I was, due to its delicious nature.   TL;DR  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch delivery and it was really good.  I had the Chicken and Mushroom pie with the fruit (watermelon).  My coworker tried the Mac and cheese and said it was delicious too.  We tried the daily tartlet for dessert and that was great too!  Will order from again!"}
{"text":"Love squarz! The spinach/feta is stupid good and I don't even liked cooked spinach. The breakfast squarz pies are delicious too. I consider myself a bit of a harsh critic (I don't like all food put in front of me and actually don't like most of it) and these are really good. They are just as good at home when you cook the frozen ones."}
{"text":"Comfort food, great service!  Food: I ordered the Spinach and Feta pie, which is essentially a square Spanakopita. The flavor was great, the crust tasty and flaky. The only criticism would be the bottom crust was a bit tough, difficult to cut even with a sharp knife.  I also ordered a side of Tomato Basil soup, and the portion was huge.  It was really creamy and nice, and tasted great! It was tomato-y as you'd expect, and the surprise was a strong peppery taste. I was disappointed that it was very salty though.  Cost: Quite reasonable: my pie and soup were only $10.79 with tax.  Service:  The owner, Steven, and his Mom were fantastic! Very friendly and eager to explain the menu.  Atmosphere: Clean, tidy, and small. Very small!  Overall: Squarz has a really interesting menu. I'll definitely be back to try other things, but will try to avoid the salty choices."}
{"text":"Another weekly stop at Square for a couple of  caramelized wonders.These are one of the best things on the planet.The service is wonderful,and it is nice to find an artisan with such a passion for his craft.The hand pies are all fantastic,the chicken/mushroom being a favorite of mine.A can't miss place."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious. Found this place through good reviews. All those 5 star reviews didn't steer me wrong. The shepherds pie was the best I've ever had. The caramelized croissant is addictive. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Fantastic croissant pies at a reasonable price. The owner is very friendly. They also have pastries that are amazing !"}
{"text":"For North siders, we found these guys at Roadrunner Farmers Market on Saturday.   Fantastic!! My girlfriend had the chocolate croissant and I had to have the spinach and feta pie after trying a sample. The spinach and feta was absolutely delicious. So, why only 4 stars?   I think anything worth a perfect rating has to be perfect and I only tried 1 pie out of the entire menu.   Why only 1 if it was soooooo good? Well, 1 pie was $3.00. Not horrible, I agree. However, 8 pies is only $11. Do the math and the value screams at you. The disappointment was in the fact that in order to purchase 8 pies, they had to all be the same. I couldn't mix and match. I was completely bummed because if the others were as good (or even better) than the spinach and feta, I wanted to try every one.  With that being said, I was able to order a variety pack on the spot with the flavors I wanted, and with the promise to have them brought the next weekend to the farmers market. Ideal since I am in N Phoenix and the store is in Tempe. This has been my carrot getting through this week.  Overall great experience with the only hiccup being having to wait to try some different pies. I wish I could remember the gentleman's name that was there, but he was great. If the store is run with his personality and his willingness to accommodate, paired with the food, they should be in business for a long, long time."}
{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review, didn't even have an account. I made one literally because of how amazing the food and service was here. The sandwich was ridiculous, the Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had and the caramelized croissant was just perfect. Can't say enough good things about this place and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Can I give 10 stars? I would if I could! Pie perfection is pretty much the theme at Squarz. We came here and had a few savory and sweet pies and left happily satisfied and stuffed.  We shared a peach tartlet, caramelized croissant, cinnamon roll croissant, and my husband had the shepherd's pie and chicken pot pie with garlic mashed potatoes. The desserts were all amazing. The peach was light, delicate, with the perfect amount of sweetness. The caramelized croissant is a dessert we all oohed and ahhhed over with each single bite. It had crispy, flaky, caramelized crust with a perfect soft textured interior. It was really a lovely balance of textures and sweetness. The cinnamon roll croissants were fresh from the oven. Oh my. If I had room in my stomach I'd eat a ton of them!  I didn't try any of the savory pies but my husband enjoyed them. The garlic mashed potato side he had with them was infused with garlic flavor, with creamy skin-on freshly mashed potatoes. Delicious.  The owner is incredibly friendly and sweet and it's no surprise that in such a short amount of time his business has grown from selling out of a small food truck to a brick and mortar location. The prices are so reasonable too it's really hard to not like anything about this place.   The location itself is a bit small though so it's not the best option for huge groups of people wanting to come here for a meal.  Heaven in a hand pie! To paraphrase Huey Lewis and the News and quoting from Cheryl B.'s photo, It's Hip to be Squar(z)!"}
{"text":"Tasty, flaky, creamy creme brûlée square. Perfection! Small little space that packs a lot of personality! Went at a great time with no line or lunch rush, cannot wait to return to try the spinach + feta!"}
{"text":"Squarz is a hidden gem. The owner/baker is so friendly and takes the time to describe the menu. I've had the chocolate croissant, Kouign Amann, and mac & cheese. Everything I've had here has been top knotch. The Kouign Amann is a stand out (buttery, flaky, and not overwhelming sweet).  I can't wait to come back to try the entire menu. Also, if you buy 5 pastries, you get the 6th for free. More incentive to be a glutton!"}
{"text":"Looks and smells Yum-Delish. Tasted absolutely delicious!!!   Super friendly!  So glad to have found you.  Great to see happy people at work doing what they love and sharing great food!"}
{"text":"Great croissants. Unreal actually. First time. Will be back. Almond, apple, creme brûlée, all so good."}
{"text":"Cute place with amazing food.. Picked up two mushroom &chicken and spinach feta pies.. So flaky and delish, just enough filling to balance out the crust.  Had the chicken pot pie on a previous trip and it was also very good.. I'm working my way down the menus..   Pies come with your choice of chips or fruit.. We enjoyed the fruit best..  Have their sweet tea .. U won't be disappointed .. Staff is super friendly .. Offered me a refill on luv tea as I was preparing to leave.. Great customer service!!   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Squarz a few times now and plan to be repeat customers especially at their new Tempe cafe. We have tried the spinach and feta (excellent with the addition of the dill!) and the breakfast one so far. We have also sampled the croissants and we were surprised that they are better than the croissants at a place down the street! Of course their croissant donuts are yummy too! In addition, they are super friendly and nice at the cafe! We are looking forward to trying their other creations soon!"}
{"text":"Yup!  Squarz.  Can't really believe that I never saw this place before tonight, but after ordering food there, I just needed to get on Yelp and rave about it.  The food really is mostly little \"squarz\" of flaky dough with filling.  The shepherd's pie was absolutely delicious.  The mac and cheese (in a cup) was a little more fancy than some I've had, with tiny onion bits and smoky flavor.  I finished off the meal with a tiny apple pie squar.  It was just enough and made a great meal even better.  We all loved our squarz and will definitely be ordering again or visiting in person soon.  Perfect for lunch and easy to eat!  Totally recommended--give it a try!"}
{"text":"Bought the pies at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market.  Good variety of flavors sold in small 4 packs, so you can pick a few different packages and have quite a bit of variety.  I love meat pies and these are much cheaper than going to Cornish Pasty (which I love also).."}
{"text":"Squares are great they are seasoned nicely and crust is so good.. We love them!@"}
{"text":"This is a really cute mom & pop shop although you can't  tell it from the outside. The inside has a cozy bar sitting and a table outside for when its nice out. The couple who runs it are really nice and provide excellent serivce.   We tried the chicken pot pie and the carmelized croissant based on all the yelp reviews. Both didn't  disappoint! The pot pie was warm and flaky with hot filling. It smelled so good when it came I couldn't  resist and almost burnt my tongue on the rich and creamy filling. The shredded chicken was moist and tender and the filling didn't soggify the crust.   The cramelized crossiant was good with as rich as an aroma as the pot pie. It was flaky, soft and a touch sticky; a nice light dessert to end with.  Can't  wait to come back and try some of their other pies and mini pies."}
{"text":"First off the food is amazing. The pot pie Mac and cheese and lemonade are sure fire winners. The main reason this place gets 5 stars from me is the service. The guy on the phone was patient (first time customer) and very polite. He then called me to tell me it was going to be a few more minutes on delivery because he wanted to make everything fresh. The delivery girl was very nice and took my card when she got here so I don't have to read the number over the phone. That was nice. I will be back again and I think I have a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This is a very cute idea that I was hoping would be a great way to simplify packing lunches to take to work.  I purchased the Chicken single squares and the Valentines Chocolate ones.  The chicken ones were tasty but too greasy, and the Chocolate ones lost all the filling while cooking.  It would have worked better if the edges were crimped or something to prevent that from happening.  Overall a good idea, and the taste was where it needed to be, but they need some major reworking to really make these something I would purchase again."}
{"text":"Tried to meet friends here. Pictures and description online looked great but there was like NO seating. May try the food some other time but didn't work a lunch visit with friends."}
{"text":"These are the most delicious things ever....all the flavors I have tired just rock, shepards pie, chicken, spinach and feta, pepperoni pizza, bbq pork and apple.  Pretty positive the others are equally amazing.   The pastry is flaky, tasty and the perfect wrapping for whatever is inside.  If you see these little nuggets of fabulousness at your local AZ farmer's market just get some.  Then go home, bake away and enjoy.  Not even a tiny chance you will be sorry."}
{"text":"These guys stayed open an extra 15 mins to wait for us so we can get some of their little caramelized Croissants. They are mind blowing.  Wish they made Kringles!"}
{"text":"Ok, all the accolades were true! Not only is it the very best chicken pot pie- to die for crust- but the proprietor is an amazingly friendly and warm young man.  This place rocks. I got a 12 pack to go- and I'm dropping off a couple at my friends house.  Got an apple pie to go- can't wait to chomp down!!  Thus will be my new hang out... There goes my waistline! I don't care!!!  Try this place! Yum..."}
{"text":"Hi we finally checked out this neighborhood place... super friendly staff... great selection... will be back to try more, and will spread the word to local foodies!"}
{"text":"I think I just found my new favorite lunch spot and as much as my helpless body had hoped it would be some healthy, green-chic organic place, it's not, because this extra ordinary place with its' simple and short menu has just literally blown me away in smithereens.   You know how Jimmy John's has a light up neon sign that says 'Free Smells?' They should be dead ashamed of themselves and tear it down because the moment you walk through this place, it is nirvana to your smelling senses. That freshly baked butter smell hits you and all you want to do is just twirl around like you're a kid at Disneyland. You can tell that everything here is homemade and made in small batches, from the limited number of pies they have in the case to the small drink dispensers. Rather inexpensive, 4.99 a pie and they have coupons to use right there at the front counter. There's not much room to sit and eat, it's more of a come and go kind of place and that's okay because pies are easy to eat that way.   I ordered the chicken and mushroom pie and it was so warm and flaky. Inside, it had huge chunks of mushroom and real shredded chicken with a sauce that was so decadent, it reminds me of the stews that take hours to make. More personally, it reminded me of all the savory pastries I used to eat when my parents took me to Le Madeleine (rip). At first when you look at the pie, you're probably thinking it won't fill you up - which you're probably right, you need two. But depending on what filling you get, halfway through the rich and tender filling it suddenly hits you like a brick in the stomach and surprises you at the same time. It doesn't mean that I didn't finish it though, because John Cena doesn't quit and neither do I.   I know I should be talking and reviewing about the filling more but in my case, I NEED to talk about the puff pastry. As a cook, puff pastry is one of the hardest things to make from scratch, period. It is one of the most fickle things to handle and one change in temperature can kill the 'puff' in 'puff pastry.' When you watch cooking/baking shows, all the chefs use puff pastry from the frozen aisle, never made from scratch. Even as they prepare the frozen sheet of pastry, they warn viewers not to handle it too much. It's also kind of expensive in my opinion too, but when you realize how hard it is to make it, it slightly makes sense. The fact that this local place is basing its business entirely on puff pastry blows my mind and it's literally some of the best that I've had. I can't wait to try their croissants next.   I didn't try this place for the longest time because from afar, I have no idea why, but the sign made it look like a vape shop. I'm glad we have Yelp because without it I wouldn't have even stepped inside this plaza to try this place. Only con? It's not open on Mondays, the day of the week where I need something this heavenly to remind me that everything will be okay, even if I did neglect to do all the chores I meant to do the weekend before."}
{"text":"This review is a little over-due. I came here on a late weekday lunch before heading to the airport. Yelp seemed to really rave about this place & I'm a HUGE chicken pot pie fan.  I had only expected the food to be great, but omg the owners!!!! They were the most amazing and sweetest family! The mom & dad works in the kitchen and the son works the counters & kitchen. I ordered additional pies to-go so I could take it back home to CA and the mom took such good care of me! She packed up my food and they included frozen bottles of water to keep the pies frozen (you definitely don't want defrosted puff pastry, trust me!) I definitely felt like she was MY mom!   I ordered the double meal (chicken pot pie & the mushroom chicken pie fresh + fruit - orange)  DOUBLE MEAL -I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they give you fruit as a side option! I chose the orange... the mom even cut the whole orange for me like my mom would!!! I felt like I was at home... but at a restaurant...  CHICKEN POT PIE -Not the typical chicken pot pie (I expected white gravy, peas, carrots, etc) but this was very different. Still good but not what I was expecting. It tastes fancier, but less comforting. There's definitely rosemary in it, which I'm not a big fan of rosemary, but I still enjoyed this pie. -Much drier than a normal chicken pot pie. The pie itself was not dry by any means, but it wasn't oozing w/ gravy -Puff pastry was AMAZING! So crispy and buttery! I could just eat this alone! -The chicken was really tender and was cooked very well -Very generous portions of chicken  MUSHROOM CHICKEN PIE -This was much more like a chicken pot pie that I'm used to - yummy gravy oozing out. So I actually enjoyed this one a lot more -Again, amazing puff pastry...  -Really generous amounts of chicken & mushroom. I love mushroom!    Frozen chicken pot pie & shepherd's pie TO GO -I'm not usually a huge fan of shepherd's pie but this one was really good! -Re-heating was very easy. They have clear instructions on their packaging and tastes ALMOST as good as eating it fresh at their restaurant!   CONCLUSION: -ADORABLE place! Amazingly sweet family that owns & runs this shop. -Food is spot on! Very yummy even though chicken pot pie is not a typical pot pie like I'm used to -One of the best puff pastry I've had in a VERY long time   If I'm ever in PHX, I'd definitely go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Grabbed one of their bacon and egg Squarz at the Ahwatukee Farmers market and I wish I would have grabbed 10.  The filling was a little dry but the pastry was just plain delicious, the right combo of flaky and buttery.  I love that they deliver, have a brick and mortar restaurant, have frozen take home, AND hit up the Farmers Market.  All the ways to get my Squarz fix!"}
{"text":"Third time was a curse instead of a charm. Usually the food here is really good and delicious. Unfortunately consistency seems to be lacking a bit later in the evening. On this trip I ordered the Chicken and Mushroom and the Caramelized Croissant. After 15 minutes I was told that they had mistakenly put in Shepherds pie in the oven that the Pie would take an additional 20 minutes. I instead opted to eat the Sheperds pie. What I got was a burnt Shepherds pie and a rock hard cold croissant. I guess regulation of the oven temperature was amiss."}
{"text":"Wow, fantastic! These are some tasty pastries! My wife and I just found this place and are very happy we did. We had a savory pastry each and then shared a delicious chocolate croissant. Also the mac and cheese is some of the best I've had.  I would definitely recommend this place to all our friends and family and will be back! Thanks guys and keep baking!"}
{"text":"Warm comfort food and warm comfortable service from probably the friendliest staff I've ever met (only the owner was in at the time and he was so kind to let his employee go early since it was a very slow evening). I had the chicken and mushroom pie. If you're a flaky crust connoisseur or amateur, this is the place to get a genuine buttery flaky crust for either a dessert or meal (I have yet to try the desserts, I made this review first thing back home after my first visit). Definitely recommend 100%."}
{"text":"Perfect flaky pastry, delicious fillings! Full 5 stars for that!!!!! Just go and have one and you'll be convinced. It's a tiny place, so try to catch one of the 2 outside tables, or take your order to go.  The one star is lost for lack of vegetables. Three of the 4 sides are carb-heavy (doubtless delicious), with one side salad option. Next time, I'll try the chicken Caesar salad with croissant!  That only leaves the \"pie r square\" conundrum! Just kidding - I'm giving a great thumbs-up and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this place on my Yelp app as it was nearby my work and decided to try it out based on the reviews. I can say, I was not disappointed!! The first thing I noticed was the service. The owners are absolutely amazing and so friendly! It was a pleasure just talking to them.  I had the chicken pot pie with mac and cheese. Both were SO delicious, but the mac and cheese was out of this world!! I was disappointed that I forgot to order dessert, but there's always next time, lol. The crust on the pot pie was so light and flaky. I can't wait to go back and try the shepherd's pie.  The building is small and easy to miss, but it's worth searching them out. My only criticism is that the portions were slightly on the small side for me, but this wasn't enough to warrant decreasing the rating. I was still certainly satisfied with the amount of food, but just wanted a bit more (maybe it was just because I was so hungry, who knows)."}
{"text":"EVERYONE needs to try the caramelized croissant. Seriously, they are SO good! Everything else was great, too. The guy who runs (owns?) the shop is very nice. You can tell he cares about what he's doing....exactly the kind of business I wanna support."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a decliocius caramelized crossaint  Flaky golden crust with caramelized sugar rimmed atop.  Layers of buttery savory throughout the bite.   A must try bakery in Tempe, AZ."}
{"text":"My daughter and I loved everything about Squarz on our recent visit. The staff are super friendly and the owner is as well! My daughter is picky when it comes to mac and cheese and she said this was the best she's ever had. The chocolate croissant I had was warm and delicious. Looking forward to trying more things on the menu on our next visit!"}
{"text":"\"I hope your freakin' apple pie is worth it!\" ? Sex-On-Legs Dean Winchester, Supernatural  Okay, so I never actually tried fruit pies here but in my defense, I really wanted to try their savory pies!  I've gotten to feast on the Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, mac & cheese, and a caramelized croissant [a delicious dessert] so far here at Squarz and everything was AMAZING!    Steven is the mastermind behind the business.  Starting from a humble food truck that sold pies at the farmer's market, he soon obtained this cozy storefront.  Serving fresh homemade savory and sweet pies is his calling.  Everything is a labor of love and takes days to prepare [seriously, it takes like three days to make those croissants y'all!].  You can taste the love yo.  He is so passionate about his product and is so charismatic.  It's so easy to fall into a lengthy conversation with him.  Steven is a freakin' rock star and he knows it.    As for the pies, oh my goodness.  Oh. My. Goodness!  They're rich, flaky, and delicious.  You can't stop eating once you get that first forkful past your lips.  The Chicken Pot Pie has a surprising sweet taste to it and the Shepherd's Pie is amazing.  I will say that when choosing your side of either chips or fresh fruit, go for the chips!  The fresh fruit is usually an apple which is great but I get awkward biting into apples in public settings.  I'm weird AF, okay?  And let's talk about their mac & cheese.  Lawdy!  Rich, heavy, and sooo friggin cheesy.  This is like a two Lactaid kinda dish for all my lactose-intolerant homies out there.  #WorthIt  Get the large and split with a friend because you're not gonna want to stop eating this.  As for the caramelized croissant, thank you Steve for giving us these beauties!  I heated them up in the microwave for 10-15 seconds later tonight and they were still delicious.  Not too sweet, flaky, and still warm and soft on the inside.  Love it.    The storefront is on the small side and seating is incredibly limited so if you want to dine in, might I suggest coming during the off-peak hours.  Or take it home and enjoy your noms under a warm fluffy blanket.  They also sell mini frozen pies at eight for $9.99!  So yes, come and support this great local place!  I really want to try their Prosciutto, Italian Cheese & Fig Squaressant Sandwich next time.  You know it sounds delish!"}
{"text":"The fact that Steven makes everything from scratch is impressive and means everything is basically 100x's better! I highly recommend not passing up an opportunity to eat here or to buy some pies at a farmers market! I also highly recommend the spinach and feta pie! This is a family friendly environment and is one of the few reasons I make a trip to South Tempe!"}
{"text":"My Squarz experience...  I placed an order online. Within 3 minutes I was called by a gentleman. They were out of a line item ordered. He politely offered me a substitution...and gave me double dessert for the inconvenience... which was no inconvenience at all except to the wasteline...  I live 5 miles from here. Delivery was oven hot and made by the same kind individual I spoke to on the phone.   Food was fantastic. Flakey pastry meat pies...Mac n cheese... fresh squeezed lemonade   He put my drink in a cooler so the ice wouldn't melt.  If I could give more stars I would.  Eat here."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic all the way around. Family-owned and operated, amazing service, attention to detail, clean, quaint, and the food was amazing. I had the chicken pot pie, which was really great--the crust was buttery and flaky, perfect--but my favorite thing was the Mac and cheese side. Oh, and the caramelized croissant for dessert was ridiculous. Apparently a three-day process to make, it caramelizes in the baking process and the result is worth going back for in and of itself."}
{"text":"I cannot be any happier to spend my Friday night anywhere else but here last night. The very last time I had dessert as good as this was during my travel in Rome, Italy few years ago....and I am so glad to have discovered this place in Arizona. I wasn't very excited to come here at first. Most American dessert tastes like nothing but s full mouth of sugar. Not this place!!!!! Between me and 3 others, we shared different pies and we cleaned them all. Their pies have just the right amount of sweet. It is flaky, tasty, and fresh off the oven (I could see it from where I sat). It isn't a big place with only few tables. Nevertheless, we still enjoy spending time at the corner for an hour. The owner is super nice, sweet and friendly towards us. He left us alone to hang out here, came around giving us refill for drinks and even gave us some extra pies that they bake an hour before closing time. We all left satisfied and happy.   We had such a wonderful time hanging out here. Good service and good food. What more can u ask for? I'll definitely come back here again."}
