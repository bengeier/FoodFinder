{"text":"Love this place. Service is fast, food is good, and the customer service is good too! The only reason I couldn't give it five is because one waitress in particular always seems to judge whatever I'm ordering. \"An appetizer.. For your dinner?? Whatever.\" \"You want buffalo on your burger?.... Ok..\"  I try to avoid sitting in the dining area because she's usually there."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches at the Draft House.  The atmosphere is fun,  the service is good, and the location is great.   Dining on the patio is great, will be looking forward to doing that again next year!"}
{"text":"made our first stop here tonight hoping to have a couple drinks, catch the game and get some decent bar food. the draft house delivered on all counts. drinks were fast, game was on sound and food was awesome. we will be back."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim, looking for something new close to home. My husband had the Frisco burger and was pleased that they asked him how they wanted it cooked -- which meant to him that it was fresh beef. He loved it, especially for the price! I had the Honey Sriracha Wrap which was very good as well. The sides cost more if you want fries, veggies, cottage cheese, etc. But we like having a choice. We just had the chips as we weren't looking for a big meal. However, we did end up getting their dessert - a brownie with ice cream on top with whipped cream and chocolate and caramel sauce drizzled over it. WOW! It was much bigger than we expected for only $3.99. Our waitress was great - friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was okay, nothing spectacular but it is a bar/restaurant. TVs were on with the Packer preseason game so this might be a fun place to watch a game sometime. Prices are really good for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Christina L is an ignorant fool. The draft house is the sort of establishment that was built for enjoying march madness basketball games, taking the kids out after  soccer, and enjoying the company of friends. If you're looking for imaginitive recipes, architecturally impressive interior design, and talented use of rare seasoning, I suggest you waltz your narcissistic body over to a restaurant designed for such, and not a neighborhood pub. Fool...shouldn'ta been talkin' s***."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try tonight since I live nearby. I ordered the Southwestern Burger and Homemade (mayo-based) coleslaw. The burger was a bit larger than a typically-sized slider but not large enough to fully satisfy. The coleslaw was evenly chopped and not overbearing on the mayo. My SO ordered the Tomato Basil Tortellini and the sausage pasta dish (I forget the exact menu name). These were tasty, but the portions were small IMO. The service was quick, polite and attentive. Typical no frills American bar food restaurant."}
{"text":"Standard hometown bar, great for football games and a cold beer. Also came in for late night and the service was super fast for a bar that was packed. Good place for a quick drink and a bite."}
{"text":"Our party came to catch the end of the Packer's season (cue sad Keanu meme).  We asked for any drink specials, they were phasing out their Three Olive vodkas and had any mixers for $4. Sweet! You could definitely taste they were trying to get rid of it, all of our drinks were strong!  Our orders as follows; 24 Wings $18.99, Onion Rings $4.99, Cheese Curds $6.99, Quesadilla $5.99, Fish Tacos $7.99, and Crispy Chicken Bacon Sandwich $6.99 with Sweet Potato Fries.  The wings came with four different choices of sauce, we chose the Draft House (a Red Hot + BBQ flavor), Asian BBQ, BBQ, and Mild. The drummies were very good, crispy skin, and  flavorful interior. The quesadillas were standard, served with tortilla chips and salsa - sufficient enough for a meal on it's own. The onions rings were standard bar onion rings, most likely not dipped and battered in-house. Cheese curds were unremarkable, some were so small that the deep drying process killed it. The crispy chicken bacon sandwich was fair, a huge breast of chicken and two strips of bacon with lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion. The sweet potato fries were the only memorable item here, it was crunchy on the outside and not mushy on the inside - the latter which is an unfortunate occurrence at most establishments.    I was hugely disappointed in the fish tacos, mostly because they didn't have any resemblance to Audrey N's previously pictured fish tacos on yelp. I was salivating over that picture when deciding on what to order. Instead the fish tacos I received were one finger-length strip of cod, filled with slivers of sliced cheddar cheese, and coleslaw. Not exactly what I had pictured, I suppose technically coleslaw is 'shredded cabbage' (as described on the menu). It was not pretty.  This is a fair place to come with friends and catch a game, our server was especially friendly having to deal with our rowdy group."}
{"text":"Service was very good here.  I dine with a 2 year old so service is really important to me.  Food came quickly and she came back several times to see if we needed anything.    Food was okay.  I had the French Dip. I would recommend asking to hold the mushrooms.  Normally, I like mushrooms but this was just weird.  My husband had the cajun chicken sandwich.  He said it was fine, a bit too cajun-y to tell if the bacon was included.  Be aware that the usually normal sides (like coleslaw) do cost extra.  I do recommend the extra for the coleslaw.  Only thing I truly did not like was the lemon in my ice tea.  It looked icky."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice for kind of a trendy sports/ divery bar. This place is gonna take some describing so bare with me. You enter through a door in the corner of the bar where you first see an ATM (hint hint) and then find some seating to your right and the bar straight ahead. As you walk towards the bar, the place kind of bottlenecks where you find the stairs to an upstairs, the door the outdoor patio and lots of bar height tables.   The bar is runs almost the length of the building then wraps around a bit near the kitchen. BTW they make some GREAT bar food especially a patty melt that was soo good I ordered it immediately the next time I went. Anywho... They have a TON of draft beers and a TON of different liquors. Great big TV's right at the bar to be able to watch any game you want and then they also have a massive projection screen for some of the bigger games as well and to watch from upstairs.They also have some of the most friendly staff I have ever met in my entire life. THEY ARE GREAT! Great doesn't even describe it. They're jubilant! Yeah, that's right your learning new words!  Anyways, Moving on to the upstairs, They have a pool table A SECOND smaller bar and another set of TV's! They also have darts and lots more seating up their. On most nights the upstairs is nice and quiet and not crowed at all so you can usually sneak in a couple games of pool and darts. Oh and this place is usually pretty clean but its a dive bar so spills can happen. Finally the outdoor patio wraps around the back of the bar just a tad and has some nice tables to sit at as well. Jeez, with all the seating you could sit a small town in there and it doesn't seem like that big of a building. Like I said it has some great staff, a nice building, and lots of seating. And great patty melts.. mmmm ok thats it i'm going to get one when i'm done with this review. Get on down there to watch some good sports, and eat and drink well without busting the bank. Watch out for the daily specials too!"}
{"text":"The Draft House is a great place to go if you're not necessarily up for trying someplace new and you are just looking for a nice time.  I mean this in the best possible way - this is a solid four stars in my opinion.  I find myself here a couple times a month because it is a proven commodity.  It helps that Verona falls between Middleton and Belleville, so I often meet my parents for dinner there.  My parents both really enjoy the place and the food is always up to snuff.  It may not be the most imaginative, but that's not what you really want at a bar & grill.  The menu is broad and covers a few styles, but mostly sticks with the tried and true burgers and sandwiches.  The appetizers are mostly familiar, but there are a few surprises to be found.  Last week my father tried the Irish Egg Rolls, which were basically egg rolls with a Reuben-style filling of corned beef, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese.  He was highly impressed.  My parents also love the spinach and artichoke dip, which is served in a bread bowl with vegetables and tortilla chips.  They often will just get that as a meal and split it.  I personally favor the Baja melt chicken sandwich and the Cuban sandwich as my two stand-bys, while I've never gone wrong with any of the wraps or burgers in the past.  They also have deli-style sandwiches (roast beef, turkey, etc.) that are perfect for lunch.  There are also daily specials that often prove to be the imaginative touch that may be missing from the menu.  I've not gotten around to trying the homemade pizzas yet, but I've heard quite a few good reviews.  My father has had the Friday fish fry before and he seemed to like it; I've never been a big fan of seafood so I usually pass.  There are dinner entrees as well (steak, salmon, pasta, etc.) but I don't believe that we've ever tried these, mainly because we generally sit in the bar area as opposed to the dining room.  The tap selection at the bar is usually pretty decent.  There's always a couple of Capital selections, including their seasonal, and at least 10-12 others.  I've never tried out the bartenders' knowledge of mixed drinks before, so I can't say either way regarding that aspect.  The restaurant is split into four areas.  The bar area is where most of the TVs are located and has about 12-15 tables with high stools and waitservice.  The dining room is to the rear and has pretty standard tables and boothes.  There is a lofted upstairs with a smaller bar.  There are a couple of pool tables and chairs along the railing, allowing people to watch the projection TV and look down on the bar area below.  Finally, there is an outdoor patio that looks out on Cross Country Road, also with waitservice.  I prefer sitting out on the patio or in the bar area myself.  The upstairs area is nice but it can get a bit smoky, since all the smoke from the bar area wafts up.  Downstairs is never that bad, which is why this is a four-star place for me instead of a three.  It works for me because my mother can smoke and my father and I aren't bothered.  I've been here a few times later on at night, and changes a bit to more of a local hang-out spot.  I've run into a few old friends from high school and generally had a good time, though for some unknown reason I'm completely unable to play pool at this bar.  The waitservice is almost always polite and prompt - once or twice we had to wait a bit out on the patio but that was coming off the lunch rush.  Parking in the lot can sometimes be a problem, especially during busy periods.  The lot will fill up, and the nearby street spots go quickly as well.  I'm really happy that Verona has a place like the Draft House.  It's the kind of place that everyone can agree on."}
{"text":"Here on a busy Sunday and the buffalo chicken sandwich is bland and onion rings cold, Reuben was good, chicken salad had stale bread and burger was raw. At least the chef salad was good"}
{"text":"Incredible staff and wide variety of food makes this a great place to go. The drink specials they have are amazing, especially on the weekends. Very fair pricing. The majority of the staff has been there since the beginning which shows in their service. Hands down the best bar and restaurant in Verona."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Draft House about a month ago.  The food took 15-20 minutes longer than I was told it would take over the phone.  On the plus side, the food was typical bar food- really hits the spot when you've had a few beers or glasses of wine.    Glad this place exists in Verona for those nights when I really want a delicious, juicy cheeseburger with mushrooms and waffle fries with ranch (they offer ranch with the fries- awesome)."}
{"text":"The restaurant accommodated our entire soccer team (40 people) and the service was great. Everyone's order was correct and the food was good. Will definitely come back next year during the local soccer tourney."}
{"text":"It might not have been \"exceptional,\" but I would say we enjoyed some pretty darn good food, service, and atmosphere here.The place is very clean and the price/quality and price/quantity of food are good."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere!!  Staff knows us by name and remembers what we like to drink. Everything on the menu is good. Had the chance to sample the chefs \"Green Chili\" at a chili cookoff, excellent! To all the haters, stay in Madison, for your gourmet meals!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after finding that our original destination, Pasquals, was closed.  I was completely unimpressed with the food, service and decor.  The food was completely unimaginative and unoriginal.  My dining partner got the buffalo chicken salad which was basically four pieces of boneless buffalo chicken atop a bed of iceburg lettuce.  Come on, really?  A salad is the one dish that can be as creative as possible.  Boring, expensive (for what it was) and unsatisfying.  I had the turkey melt, which again was nothing great.     I expected a lot more from this place, being that it is a new establishment in an upscale neighborhood in an upscale suburban community.  If standard food is what you crave, skip this overpriced  cafeteria and head to Culvers."}
{"text":"Best wings in Madison! And for that matter probably all of Wisconsin! Fun sports bar type atmosphere with lots of TVs and a good beer selection. The staff is great as well, quick service and always very courteous."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff is friendly and attentive.  Food is great.  Cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Very fresh tasting. The staff is very amicable and attentive. They are also flexible when it comes to menu substitutions. I ordered the crispy chicken wrap and substituted the BBQ sauce for an Asian sauce which was a good choice. The onion rings are crispy, crunchy, and not too oily. Very quick meal prep, and really great prices too! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We've given The Draft House a couple of chances and each time we have regretted it. The food is mediocre at best.  The menu is extremely unimaginative and even then, the kitchen staff seemed to have a great amount of difficulty properly preparing our order. Oh, and then there was the time the waitress argued with me over the freshness of the guacamole.  Good times.  I gave 2 stars because the Friday fish fry wasn't terrible.  Not that I'm recommending it, but it was adequate."}
{"text":"Great wings, great pizza and the beer selection is not bad either.  Honestly, I fail to recall a bad meal we have had here."}
{"text":"Went to the Draft House for lunch a few weeks back with family. Had a Turkey Melt this time around. Very good sandwich - the Sourdough was excellent and fresh. Grilled lightly and not overly greasy. The turkey, bacon and cheese all very fresh. I was pleased. My brother and mother also had sandwiches. All of us were happy. Service was prompt and polite. A good place to go - bar atmosphere but much better than your standard bar food. Separate dining area from the main bar too so good place to eat."}
{"text":"The service here was awful. My friend and I were immediately greeted and taken to a table. Our drink order was taken and then nothing. Eventually our drinks came, after about ten minutes. This was also a Sunday night and it was NOT busy. We were two of about 8 people in the entire bar area.  Then we put in an appetizer order. Two more friends came to join us. They received their drinks, but no appetizers. At this point it had been a half an hour. Another person comes and ask us to refresh his memory about the order. Fifteen minutes later, we received our appetizer. What?!  45 minutes for southwestern rolls. Yeah.  We asked about drink specials and were told about them. We both ordered off the special menu. At the end of the night, we learned that the special was a little different than what we were quoted. Normally not a big deal but never in my life has it taken the better part of an hour for four drinks and an appetizer.  We did not stay for another. At least the appetizer was tasty."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and service is always great even during busy game days and Friday Fish Fry. My food is always excellent and prepared as ordered."}
{"text":"Stopped in with Mad City Cocktail book after calling to see if we could use food portion for the fish fry..Phone answer was yes,server/ manager answer when ordering was no??   Had fish frys anyway.Ordered a fried cod and perch with companion.. Fish was average at best.. Service remains attentive and  very friendly..2 star on fish,4 star on the rest.."}
{"text":"Draft house definitely has the small town vibe going on, where everyone knows everyone else and gossip runs rampant anytime someone walks in the door. I came here by myself for a lunch break in-between home visits for my job, and when I walked in it felt like everyone turned and looked at me. I seated myself in the front room that is separate from the bar and a waitress came to me right away to hand me my menu.   I had the BLT with fries and it was tasty. It wasn't blowing my mind it just was good. It's tough to get a BLT wrong. The fries were good, the waitress was quick and I was in and out within 20 minutes. I appreciated the speediness as I was on a schedule. If I find myself in the area again I would definitely stop by again. It's better than fast food, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken salad was cheap and tasty! My girlfriend has the fish tacos which were also great! Total was under 20 and wee were satisfied."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our recent trip to the Draft House.  It is kind of a local/townie bar, and the worst part about our visit was how obnoxious other patrons were.  A couple of ladies were constantly screaming obscenities and there was a  guy drumming up donations for his son's wrestling club raffle.    We first went to the second floor bar, where there are a few seats.  The bartenders looked overwhelmed and although they gave us a beer list, they never actually took our order within 5-10 minutes time.  So we went back down to the first floor bar.  The bartender there was friendly and attentive.  The food was reasonably priced.  We got the jalapeno popper wontons.   I got the firestarter burger, cooked to medium as requested.  My partner got the tuna melt.  The food came out very quickly.  The portion of sweet potato fries was generous.  Bonus points for having a good dark beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Awesome cheese curds and great homemade ranch! We like the wraps and sandwiches a lot. The only thing that we have tried that we didn't like was the Mac n cheese. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The Draft House is a V-Town staple! They've consistently provided a great atmosphere, great service, and very good food at reasonable prices. Their staff turnover is very low so expect to see a familiar face if end up going their regularly. Have a good time!"}
{"text":"Just an a ok in my book.  We stopped by to get a take home meal and thought the food was good but nothing spectacular.   The bar itself looks like a kind of fun sports bar to enjoy with a group of friends but kind of small.  The menu is nice in it's simplicity but will be criticized for it's lack of diversity.  Whatever.  I like simplicity most times but their food needs something extra to wow me if I am to go there regularly. The waitress was terrific and very helpful even though I just ordering to go.  She got a nice tip  out of her good service."}
{"text":"Best bar in Verona and one of my favorites on all the west side. Bartenders are on top of it! great service. Very friendly staff. Food is really tasty too. I love the soups here always taste homemade and delicious. Pretty much everything is good here to eat but some of my favorites are the cheeseburgers, quesadilla, nachos, and fish fry. Good amount of tvs always a game on. I like the beer selection as well"}
{"text":"Unassuming bar and eatery with a sportsbar attitude. Excellent beer selection. Food was decently priced and above average. Great place to bring the folks from out of town."}
{"text":"I love the draft house! It is huge...just ridiculously spacious. I came here with my Husband and family during the first week of the March Madness tournament, and we were able to find a place where my husband could watch like 3 different games, but where we could still hear each other talk. Pretty rare this time of year!  The menu is as big as the restaurant, there's really something for everyone. I've had the wings (great!) and Santa Fe wrap, and loved both. Beer selection is large but relatively common. All drinks and food are very reasonably priced. Nice large patio for summer and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday had the cowboy burger and fries, solid burger no complaints but didn't wow me either. The place has a great price point with two sandwiches with fries for $18. I thought the tap list was great even though I didn't have a beer. It's more of a bar and grill than a draft house, and it seems to more cater to the bar crowd. If I wanted to watch the game, have a beer and grab a burger I would go here. It was pretty busy at 1 pm on a Sunday so it must be popular in the area."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in Verona to watch the game?  This is the place.  They've got two levels of bars and seating, lots of small TVs downstairs and a huge projector screen visible from both levels.  I've watched Badgers and Packers games here.  I haven't gotten food but they've got cider on tap along with lots of beer.  The restrooms are cramped with multiple users and they could use another soap dispenser but, hey, it's a sports bar so as a woman I rarely have to wait in line.  They have a large parking lot but on game days expect to park on the street unless you get there early.  They definitely have more seating than parking.  The bartenders and servers are super friendly.  I seriously feel like a regular every time I come here even though I'm not a frequent visitor.  I like that.   Keep up the good work Draft House!"}
{"text":"I won $70 gambling there so yeah Im a fan!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn about giving this place only a 3-star rating after my most recent visit, because it was a pleasant experience. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, despite the dinnertime rush, and the wings and the fish tacos we ordered were both tasty and reasonably priced. And the dessert hit the spot just right. However, I've had some lackluster experiences here in the past. I wouldn't recommend their Saturday Night Prime Rib; it was very fatty with the fat still \"under-cooked\" (not that it was raw, but it had that dull yellowish color and it was chewy) and the meat itself was pale and gray. I haven't had any outright negative experiences here though."}
{"text":"Met a few people here on a Friday night and I was worried with all the negative reviews about the service, but it was WAY better than the reviews reflect.  We sat upstairs and the waitress was extremely attentive.  Before we even finished our beer, when we were at 1/3 of a glass she was already back with refills.   The menu is HUGE.  They have everything from burgers to these amazing won ton things that a crunchy, spicy, and overall just amazing.  There were some other appetizers we tried that were also good.  The nacho's are enough feed at least 5 people and are loaded with toppings.  The variety of beer on draft is impressive.  I do wish they would hand out a written copy since it is hard to look on the wall and figure out what to order.  Some description or summary of each beer on a piece of paper would be helpful.  Overall, despite what the other reviews say, our service would outstanding.  The food was decent.  I would definitely rec'd the Draft House for watching a game, drinking some beer, and enjoying appetizers that are pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Just love this place.. Baked and baked potato... Talk to Erin in the upper bar Back again always good"}
{"text":"We ventured here while in town for a basketball tournament with a grout of 30 of us.  They started off on the wrong foot. The waitress was rude and made a big deal over taking orders between our two tables.  The restaurant is spacious but it doesn't seem they are accustomed to handling crowds.   Fortunately the food was good...the sandwiches looked especially good and my Chef Salad was very tasty.  Several folks ordered wings and were happy. It's hard for me to get over the rude waitress...even with the good food..if it were possible I'd give them a 2.5 instead of a 3."}
{"text":"There's a bar in Verona? What? Where? Down the street and around the corner from my apartment? Who knew.  Draft House is definitely a nice change of pace and change of scenery from the typical downtown establishments. I didn't like that the bar seemed really isolated, but that may just be because I'm not the type to end my night at the same place that I started.  At 1:30AM on a Saturday night, there was still a healthy handful of folks hanging out. I liked the two floor set-up and the laid-back vibe, but if I had my way, this would not be my first choice of late night establishments."}
{"text":"Great drinks, excellent food, and when I wanted walleye for lunch (normally only allowed after 5pm) they made an exception without me even asking them to! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"After our weekend soccer tournament, the team moved next door to celebrate a fun season.  We called ahead and they carved out some space for us upstairs.  There's plenty of room to put your larger party (I think we had 40 total - kids and adults).   Service was very good and the food was tasty.  I had a french dip with cheese curds.  The curds were really good, even after they sat for a while.  My french dip was good enough for me to eat half of it before I remembered I had au jus to dip it in.  It was even better then!  The kids menu has plenty of options, including a crowd favorites - mini corn dogs and chicken tenders.  Boom.  There are plenty of TVs around to catch \"the games\" on.  Upstairs has a pool table and dart boards.    I'll have this again when in the area!"}
{"text":"I was here for a retirement party on the second level bar.  The bartender was very nice and he hustled to keep the party foods and paper products stocked.  It was a very nice place for my friend's party.  The downstairs bar looked nicely set up.  Looks like you can do bar or table/booth.  Worth a second look the next time I travel to Verona.  Only bad thing was no elevator to the second level for disabled patrons to get up there."}
{"text":"The tropical chicken habanero is a fantastic sandwich. its crispy, spicy, tangy, I love it. My new favorite meal...with the jalapeno pepper wontons. A must visit when in Verona,or Madison."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff and piss poor food.  I was double charged for my food/drinks and was called a liar by the establishments onsite manager David, he said these kind of things only happen in places like \"Washington\" or \"New York\" and not Verona.   I'll boycott this place and spread the word of my experience."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout the other day. I wasn't super impressed with it. Everything was super soggy and I arrived at the time I said I would be there.  I got the Honey Bourbon Chicken Wrap - sounds delicious, right? I wasn't sure if I could taste the bourbon. Also, I ordered it with crispy chicken. It was not very crispy. Nor were the fries that I got with it. There was just so much honey sauce that the sweetness was overwhelming.  I'm guessing I should order something else next time. It seemed like a pretty popular place when I stopped in!"}
{"text":"Besides the cuban sandwich, I have no desire to eat a the Draft House."}
{"text":"Food was good not great. I ordered perch and the others ordered walleye and cod. All of our food was lukewarm. My wife's walleye was like cardboard.  They took it back and gave her a free meal. Overall the service was below average. They should be better prepared for a Friday night to accommodate larger crowds. We won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"I grabbed some wings to go a couple months back.  The wings were awesome.  Nice and big and the sauces that they had were awesome.  I mowed all 18 of them down in my hotel room.  (Business trip).  When I'm back in the Verona area again, I will definitely be coming back to order some of their awesome wings."}
{"text":"Why there for a happy hour event sometime ago and it was good. It's a typical bar and I think it meets the standard set by Wisconsin bars for bar food. I wouldn't eat here everyday, but definitely once in a while I'd go. Has some good views and friendly staff, so they have that going for them. Got their nachos appetiser and it was decent."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch on a week day about  1:00. Our waitress took our order then went to sit at the bar and eat. Our food was brought to us by someone else. We had to ask for silverware and drink refills. Nobody ever came back to our table to check on us. If  they had come back I would have mentioned that my steak sandwich which I ordered medium well was very under cooked and my husbands burger ordered medium was very well done. We were one of two tables of people in the place. Would not come back. Service and food both lacking."}
