{"text":"Most disgusting food ever! Meat is bland, guacamole tastes gross and the place looks dirty! Their is nothing gourmet about this place, yuck! Oh and to top it off the staff is rude."}
{"text":"The burrito I had was way too expensive, small, and bland. If you like burritos, don't get one here."}
{"text":"For an airport it was expected to be a bit expensive. Got two chicken tacos with sour cream and cheese as add ins. Was super salty. Not bad portion size."}
{"text":"I did not even try the food, why? Because the way the people that work there talk to me told me they did not wanted to work there. Rude and just for the money people. Then I came to yelp to see their reviews, I knew these were going to be low, and they were low. I can tell you, it is difficult to ruin a simple burrito, but if you have the wrong people on it, they will ruin anything! To the owner: \"take care of your place!\""}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. It is located inside the airport and I was desperate for food before my flight back home.  I knew food would not be served on my flight and I didn't have time for breakfast before heading to the airport.  Once I got to my gate, I didn't see any other close options and I like burritos so I went for it.

Yuck, yuck, yuck!  The chicken burrito I ordered had rice, beans, and no flavor.  Even adding their salsas to the burrito could not save it.  I have no idea what process they use to remove flavor from food, but they should stop it.

I paid $12 for this thing plus a drink, which isn't a bad price considering I was trapped in an airport, but I felt ripped off after tasting it.  I ended up throwing the burrito away.  At least my Diet Coke was good.

Maybe Chipotle, Freebirds, Mission Burrito and any other restaurant that sells a burrito has spoiled me.  Maybe the quality is better at locations not in the airport.  Maybe they should all be shut down.  I don't know.  I just know I will never eat at any 360 Gourmet Burrito again.  I would suggest looking for another place at the airport to eat, or just starve."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas this weekend and as we waited for our flight home to SD...we browsed through the food options in concourse B and found 360 Burrito. We actually didn't eat here. We checked out the menu through the window and it seemed great. Different, fresh, healthy! However while observing the kitchen and employees, we saw how unorganized and unsanitary it was!!!! It was horrible! In the 5 minutes we stood there...the female cook (with tattoo on neck and red glasses) although did have gloves on, kept touching her face to straighten up her glasses. Then continued to wrap burritos. Then she went to the corner (next to door that leads to storage room, it seemed) and munched on some food. Then went straight back into the kitchen, while still chewing and grabbed some tortillas to put on the grill!!!! Disgusting!!! All of this in front of tons of customers! Makes we wonder if Vegas has any health inspectors! Or if this place even has a manager!!! I only gave this restaurant 1 star for the concept! Great idea, that's all!"}
{"text":"If you like your black beans to be small and crunchy, this is the place to go.  Since I'm not a fan of biting into cracking beans, I rate this place 1 star (can't go lower than that)....  Too bad it's associated with Baja Fresh as it certainly doesn't shine for them...it's instead a shiner (aka \"black eye\").

Update: if you email the company at the link, you'll get an email failed to deliver message back....how appropriate is that?  Wow."}
{"text":"If I can save even one person from coming here, this review was worth it. Cold, stale tortilla chips and burrito that tasted like it was run over by a car and then sat in someone's locker for a week. Just don't."}
{"text":"It was around 6:30 on a Friday when my husband was trying to find something quick to get just before our plane was going to board.  This place was close to our gate and had a vegetarian option.  Normally, we enjoy Mexican food and I find it pretty hard to screw up.  Until we got a veggie burrito from here, that is.

They were getting ready to close (who closes at 6:30?), so maybe that had something to do with it.  The burrito had some kind of off peanut buttery taste to it, and despite the fact that I was starving, I managed to only eat a couple bites before giving up.

I would say no to this place, unless your super pressed for time and ready to pass out from hunger."}
{"text":"If you could give zero stars, this place would have earned it.  Don't be fooled by the gourmet pricing... The $8 tacos consisted of dry flour tortillas with a few chunks of chicken jerky and a small scrap of lettuce. No sauce, no cheese, no flavor.  Burrito much the same. If presented with no other options, do yourself a favor and eat the wad of cash instead."}
{"text":"I have never in my life been left feeling more ripped off. I ordered a chicken quesodilla (7.99) and after adding chicken, got charged 12.40. I got handed a tiny plastic container that weighed 5oz tops, with nothing more inside than a folded tortilla with the equivalent of a slice of cheese and hints of a few borderline undetectable shredded chicken bits. I showed the manager and was offered a side of quac and chips, which was nice but I turned it  down. From the other reviews, it seems that this is standard practice. Avoid."}
{"text":"Has to be THE worst burrito I have ever tasted. The chicken was so salty I found the entire thing inedible. If the 12$ burrito unfit for human consumption wasn't bad enough the staff topped the cake with their rude attitudes. I love burritos and if you really want to know it's pretty damn hard to mess one up.. Congratulations 360.. Job well done on screwing up."}
{"text":"Service was terrible,  the employees were arguing and moving way too slow.  My chicken bowl didn't even have chicken in it. I wish I could return it but I'm on the plane and it's too late."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. I had a wheat breakfast burrito and could only eat a couple of bites. Had to stop because it felt like powder eggs, old cheese and stale tortilla. The only thing good was quick serviceand a salsa bar. Don't fall for the clean look and display, a greasy diner would at least taste better. Einstein bros bagel right next to it, trust name brands while traveling."}
{"text":"This by far is some of the worst food I have ever had in my 40 years on earth. I would rather have a cold can of spam. How does this happen at one of the United States busiest airports. Wow. 

The cook was using dirty pans used on previous orders. I saw him cook shrimp for a burrito and then use it to cook chicken for someone. Wtf!!!!

All bad!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in this garbage airport.  I had the beef and prawn burrito-upgraded it to \"super\" (includes sour cream, guac and cheese). It was bout $10.  Open salsa bar and fast service is always nice.  I expected little meat and small precooked shrimp.   Boy was I wrong.  I had it on the plane after 2 hours and it was sooooo good.  Huge shrimps with lots of carne asada.  It was fantastic.  Best airport food in vegas.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food, shitty service.
If you can, eat before the airport.  If you must, food here is good, just don't expect to be alerted your food is ready, requested sauce will be part of the delivery or that the staff will acknowledged you are a human at all. 
Fuck this place."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken salad was dry. Staff were forgetful and unengaged. There were no forks and knives stocked so I had to help myself to their cabinets of supplies. Waste of $10. Go to Einsteins."}
{"text":"Bullet point summary:

- Prices are not terribly expensive for airport food
- Don't expect great service. Remember, it's airport fast food
- Chicken based burritos are awful here. 
- Tofu veggie burrito and shrimp burrito are better, get those
- Small. Chipotle has spoiled us all. This is a \"normal\" sized burrito which is about 70% of the size of a Chipotle one
- Pre ready and packed salsas are nice to grab quickly. But, there is a catch: they all are terrible. 

Remember also that this airport has so few decent food options that relative to others, so I cannot say \"avoid, go elsewhere\" since the going elsewhere is actually pretty hard to do.

Overall, not terrible, not good, so 2 stars."}
{"text":"Overpriced, low quality ingredients. An insult to burritos everywhere.

Portions are extremely small. If you're expecting anything close to an authentic burrito or even a Chipotle/Qdoba level one just keep on walking."}
{"text":"Good burritos. I chose the chicken, Cajun style. Definitely a spicy one, my lips were burning on top of the sunburn I got here in Vegas.

It is off at the end of one of the 'B' gate terminals but worth the walk if you're in B or C.

The help could have been a little more friendly. Otherwise, for airport options, this is probably a good choice."}
{"text":"360, yeah you really got it twisted with the name. The place is 360 and nothing about it is gourmet, more like 360 Garbage. Roberto's needs to open a place in this airport and fast. Please!!!!!"}
{"text":"My short flight was delayed for a couple hours.  Obviously airport food is expensive and portions are tiny.  But with all of the great food choices in Las Vegas, I expected something better near the Southwest Airlines gates.

360 Gourmet Burrito would seem to be modeled as a low-class Chipotle.  Obviously minimal investment in quality and presentation.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  I threw it away after four bites, but that was half-a-burrito too late!  I already had my worst indigestion decades -- It lasted about one hour per bite.

I'd suggest that you try one of the other places, but the best choice is to bring your own sandwich.  Or take advantage of the situation to start a half-day dietary fast.  Or buy a bag of tortilla chips at the news stand.  Or ask the Southwest flight attendant for an extra bag of peanuts."}
{"text":"Awful experience!  The burrito is small for the price you pay, and the sauces amd cheese all cost extra.  Your single burrito could cost you $15!  I had the steak burrito and the steak was so tough.

The worst part of this experience was they had problems with their soda machine and failed to tell us that prior to selling us a $3.50 soda.  When I asked for a refund, the woman said that she couldn't because she is not authorized to do a refund until her manager shows up! 

Warning!  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I stopped here to eat as it seemed like the healthier choice of the 2 options in terminal B. I ordered 2 chicken tacos with corn tortillas. The girls behind the counter were busy talking about their personal lives. As one of the food preparers hastily prepared my taco on the counter, I noticed that she slapped down 4 tortillas that tore when she grabbed them.  I thought, she surely isn't going to actually prepare my tacos with broken up tortillas.  But I was wrong, as she continued to chit chat with the girl next to her, she shoved them in a bowl and stuffed them with chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo, and guacamole.  I thought it was odd to received tacos in a bowl. I proceeded to eat at the counter and thought since they were made with two tortillas they would stay together. When I picked them up, they were semi cold, under heated, and bottomed out and fell apart. Why would you prepare food for a customer with damaged ingredients? Needless to say, after the taco bottomed out and fell into the sleeve of my sweater, I continued with a fork.  I was so annoyed as I listened to this crew continue to chit chat in front of customers with lack of care for the quality of food, appearance, and customer experience.  Management should read the reviews and share them with the employees and work to improve your food quality and experience!"}
{"text":"Steer clear of this restaurant. I thought, how bad can it be? It's probably similar to Chipotle. Wrong! I had the burrito bowl with tofu. It was the worst tofu I have ever had, I couldn't eat it. I pretty much paid $15 for a small portion of rice and beans, which weren't all that great either."}
{"text":"I want to point out that we did not eat the food, even though it smelled  pretty good to me. We walked in inquiring about the food and the young african american cashier was super helpful in answering all of our questions and we ended up not getting anything due to our flight time but we noticed a unattended wallet and the young cashier went well out of his way to get the wallet back to the owner. I give 3 stars for the service!"}
{"text":"Nope don't do it. Turn around and walk away. This place is not worth the headache. After spending almost 40 bucks for 1 burrito, 1 burrito bowl and 2 drinks they still screwed up my order. The food isn't that great either, so yes you have been warned."}
{"text":"Terrible service, i ordered a shrimp salad and the lettuce wasn't fresh. I ended up throwing the salad away. A few co-workers have complained about food poisoning from this place as well."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I was probably asking for it when I didn't bother to check Yelp before eating at this place. I got a Garlic Lime Steak Burrito Bowl and it was one of the worst things that I've had in my life. It SEVERELY lacked flavor to the point where everything kind of just tasted like a pile of mush with beans drowning all the odd flavors out. For something that's \"gourmet\" and more expensive than chipotle I expected it to at least match it... Nope, the portions were small and the food was borderline disgusting. Garlic lime is just a sauce that they drizzle on the food...contrary to what their menu advertises. Do yourself a favor and just go eat at Einstein bros like I should have."}
{"text":"Avoid.  Ordered the steak burrito. It was dry and tasteless.  Possibly the worst burrito I've ever had.  A waste of money, tummy space and calories.  Boo to you non gourmet 360 burrito!"}
{"text":"Coming back after a fun & indulgent weekend in Vegas, we hit the airport in time for an early dinner.  Running so late in town, we didn't have time to get something delish to-go & were left w/ only airport offerings

Enter 360 Gourmet Burrito

Since the airport is going through a MAJOR rehaul, the Southwest Terminal is like a ghost town & literally 2 min after we exited the place at something ridiculous like 6pm, they closed.....guess everyone traveling on later flights will just have to go hungry b/c there's NOTHING else around, unless you want a pretzel

BF & I got the burrito w/ spicy thai sauce & tofu - just a standard rice, beans & cheese burrito w/ teeny cubes of tofu & a non-spicy, spicy sauce - in fact, I'd go so far to say it was bland.  

Overall, the burrito was okay & it was filling but we weren't all that impressed - more like meh, okay..... & I was hating myself for trying something all fru-fru when I know I like my burritos to be the classic RBC.  But I always seem to get sucked into those \"gourmet\" menu items!  Darn it!

Next time will stick to the basics & get the Rice, Beans, & Cheese

'Cause, yeah, we'd probably go back if found in the same situation & not lucky enough to be flying out of the Virgin Terminal - where all the tasty fast food options are located"}
{"text":"I got the chicken nachos and my husband got steak tacos. We felt it was not bad for airport food. Not cheap, but also pretty on par for airport prices. 
We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Horrible airport burrito I ever had. The shop looks nice with catchy phrases like 360 gourmet ingredients and what not but the taste is awful. Even worse, they charge you extra for everything, right from cheese, sauce, and guac. An usual burrito with all the usual ingredients will make it to $20 here. Such a daytime robbery for a tasteless burrito. Grab a flatbread at the Einstein bagels right across and you will be happy you did that."}
{"text":"It's hard to explain how dumb people can be in real life until u experience them. I asked for a sample of beef and they said they don't have any. When I said it says carne asada in the menu they said \"oh\" and gave me a sample. I'm so glad I asked because it tasted like a beef jerky with no seasoning.

I will laugh at you if you come here and support these stoners."}
{"text":"Um. Ew. I know airport food is supposed to be overpriced and still suck, but this was just plain bad. Luckily I was so famished that the bloated feeling I had afterward was oddly welcome. But while eating my burrito, everything about it was just bland. No taste to it at all, even after dumping an entire cup of the \"hot\" green salsa on it. The green salsa isn't hot at all and mild at best. I'd say try to look for something else, although I think in this airport you'd be finding a diamond in the rough. Maybe just stick to the known chains or pizza.

Positive note, the female cashier was nice?"}
{"text":"Bad service over priced and not a thing to brag about food. I will not visit again. I hope this is the right location in the airport because that is the one I am basing my review on. Staff was rude, short and did I believe everything they could to get me to post a bad review. Mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"5 stars for this place based on its location - in an airport.  Compared to anything else available at McCarran (and virtually any other airport, for that matter), this place really lives up to the adjective in its name.

You know you picked the right refueling station when you walk into the restaurant and smell the closest thing to ambrosia i can imagine - garlic and onions being freshly sauteed.  This is the best part of the place.  Everything tastes like it was cooked to order instead of assembled to order.

The tortillas are chewy and fresh tasting; spanish rice is deliciously seasoned.  There's a variety of interesting flavors - curry, cajun, lemon-garlic - and a wealth of vegetables - spinach, mushrooms, peppers, onions, tomatos.

Salsa bar gets the job done.

The only knock on this place is that it isn't open 24 hours."}
{"text":"The dining experience at 360 Gourmet Burrito was a total 180 compared to the previous 1 star reviews.  The lady cashier was very kind processing my order and to no surprised either as I could tell she was from the Philippines were courtesy and kindness is the norm.  The excellent service continue as I only waited a minute or two for my Thai wrap.

When comparing their burrito to Chiptole's, the 360 burrito has a lengthier tortilla flour wrap; however, there was an abundant amount of ingredients such as rice, shredded lettuce, and chicken.  The chicken was cooked well, e.g. not raw nor overly cooked.  The peanut sauce was slightly present inside the burrito. It definitely could have used more sauce or even a separate container of sauce to dip the burrito.

The Thai wrap was enjoyable to eat and fulfilled the job to hold me from starving during a 4.5 hour flight.  Perhaps 360 GB could enhance the Thai wrap's flavor by adding bean sprouts, cilantro, and/or daikon.  If that day comes I'll increase my rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. They were rude and speaking to each other in only Spanish. They gave me pico de gallo instead of salsa for chips and salsa. The burrito I got was flavorless and expensive! This place is disgusting and not authentic at all."}
{"text":"For all the sins I've committed in Vegas ,360 gourmet burritos is a fitting punishment prior to my departure. I can best describe the quesadilla as half melted American cheese betwixt a floppy tortilla with some old tomatoes thrown in for that slimy texture. Since I ate it, we're even Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a breakfast burrito on my way out of town. The total tab for the burrito (with bacon) and a drink was about $13. For that price, the burrito was very small and the eggs were COLD (yuk!) and they threw on a couple of pathetic (also cold) strips of bacon. As a result the cheese didn't even melt within the tortilla shell and the whole thing was pretty disgusting.

The fountain machine was malfunctioning so that it was spraying syrup droplets on the sleeve of my shirt and the napkin dispenser was also broken. Small things admittedly. But the whole thing adds up to a place that enjoys a good location and really does not care about the food they serve or the whole experience"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The Health Service should be contacted.  Rotting lettuce in my wrap was disgusting. Even if the food had been sanitary the portions were micro sized and the prices were macro sized--$15 for a drink and wrap. If you are stuck in this terminal walk 25 feet to Bagel Bakery or wait for the peanuts on Southwest!"}
{"text":"Don't go here!  Don't say that I didn't warn you.  I made the mistake of not reading the Yelp reviews before getting food here.  Just like the other reviewers have said, 360 Gourmet Burrito is like a wannabe low quality version of Chipotle.

You basically order your food at the register and pay for it.  Then you wait for your order number to be called.  The food came out really fast which is a plus, but I noticed that they had gotten my order wrong.  I ordered a steak burrito bowl and a chicken burrito and instead I got two burritos.  I told the guy who was working behind the counter that I ordered a burrito bowl and not two burritos.  He literally looked at the receipt and said, \"Well, it says two burritos on here that's why I made two burritos.\"  I repeated to him that I ordered a burrito bowl.  He then repeated that the receipt says two burritos.  Oh hell no!  Are you for real?  I think he could tell that I was about to go off on him so he quickly said, \"Do you want me to make you a burrito bowl then?\" with a slight attitude.  I didn't want him spitting in my food so I just said that as long as I'm charged correctly then whatever, I'll just take the burrito even though I didn't order that.  Then the guy turned to his co-worker and yelled, \"Stop taking the orders wrong!\"  I know, hella professional.

I grabbed the food and took it elsewhere to eat.  The burritos were horribly wrapped.  Literally, the burrito was not covered completely by foil.  There was an opening with exposed burrito.  My bf and I had to bite into our burritos to figure out which was which since the burritos were not labeled either.

The burritos were tiny for being $10 each.  I understand that airport food is expensive, but these burritos were such a rip off.  Each burrito had like 5 small chunks of meat.  It was like I had ordered a vegetarian burrito.  The food didn't taste good either.  You're better off drinking your own saliva."}
{"text":"This is probably the biggest disappointment I have ever had in an airport burrito! It is almost as if they know absolutely nothing about what a breakfast burrito should taste like... But yet have mastered the marketing and packaging of Burrito experience...all emptiness included. 

Wrapped inside of an otherwise excellently cooked tortilla were flavorless eggs undescribable cheese, somewhat cold black beans and completely absent, pico de gallo.

I asked for hot sauce, sensing that this is going to be a disaster, and they gave me a container of something that resembled Cream of tomato soup but of course tasted worse than cream of tomato soup... Not sure how to rescue this thing.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I have to give these guys some stars for being the best burrito I have ever had at an airport.  Nice people, speedy service.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked my chicken and artichoke heart burrito.  It was so hot, I had to wait a while before I inhaled it at my gate.  How often can you say that about airport food?"}
{"text":"I wish I yelped this before I actually bought my food =\.. I had the chicken artichoke mushroom. Artichoke was tasty and you cant really mess up cooking mushroom, but the chicken was so bland and dryyy ! Definitely not worth the +$8, save your money and just wait for the peanuts and snacks on the plane !"}
{"text":"Located in Terminal B of McCarran.  I greatly prefer Chipotle for fast casual Mexican food, but 360 looked like it had some interesting flavor combos.  You can jazz up your selections with Thai, Cajun, and Teriyaki styles among others.

I got a burrito bowl with Chicken, Mushroom, and Artichokes.  Portions a bit on the smaller side for $10, but the flavors were decent and the food was piping hot.  Artichokes were good sized and were pickled, which gave some nice acidity."}
{"text":"awful.  even for a stranded, hungry airport captive.

ordered the steak thai wrap.  3 bites into it, had to toss it. Still, stayed with me for 4 very uncomfortable hours. Who knows what I ingested but it was not something humans should consume--even on a bet.

hold your appetite for a joint that won't make you regret what you eat."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow when I came here for a quick something before a flight. The burritos were good though. It's airport food, but it is done ok. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Absolute worst burrito I've ever had. I threw the last half away and wish I had done the same with the first half. No flavor, dry, tasted stale, and on and on. If there is no other place open still don't eat here."}
{"text":"God I hope you found this review before you buy anything here. They will get your order wrong, they will give you the wrong burrito, they will upcharge you by adding things like bacon when you didn't even order them. MaryGin employee number ? 355592 on Nov 26, 2017 at 2:26pm CHK 4339. 

Wow disgusted with the way they work. Have some self respect."}
{"text":"Pretty marginal, even by airport standards.  Lacks flavor, over priced for the value.   I've tried both dinner and breakfast... Fills your belly if there is nothing else ... Which there isn't.  Pretty sure eggs are powdered or processed.  Soda is good !"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food, terrible prices. Don't waste your time, money, or energy on this location."}
{"text":"Shame on you, guys! Terrible service! No seats. i asked cup for water. girl said they have cup for ice. and water i can get in the bathroom. do you wanna drink water from the bathrooms sink? burrito was small and expensive. but the worst part it didn't have any taste. i asked about some sauce or ketchup. they sent me to the Einstein bros. bagels bar next door. Really?"}
{"text":"Missed opportunity.

The food is ok but the restaurant, located here in terminal B at the airport seems to be run without management.  The employees, while friendly, are horribly disorganized and inefficient.  Get a good Chipotle or Starbucks manager in here and it's a winner."}
{"text":"Since this is apparently owned by Baja Fresh, how could I go wrong? Trust me, this one was VERY wrong.

I would give this one NO stars, but Yelp won't let me.

BEWARE the nachos. These people should be investigated for false advertising. The menu says the nachos have cheese. Yeah. And the Pope bows down five times a day facing Mecca to pray. It's not even close to a cheese sauce. It's some hydrogenated oil based abomination guaranteed to produce heartburn. Why waste decent (not great but at least decent) black beans and guacamole on this?

Why waste your money on this? Even though it is less than $10 for the nachos, they were very over priced for the \"quality\" so I gave the 2$ rating.

I spoke to fellow passengers who had come in, seen my \"nachos\" and decided to walk to the far end of the airport to Pizza Hut. At least they were happy with their choice for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been traveling for 18 hours due to weather delays and cancels. I have been dealing with many clerks, cashiers, and Southwest representatives in person and on the phone. My experience at 360 Burrito this morning stood out and made my day. Gorian asked how I was doing and I felt genuine concern and sympathy for my travel woes. 

Is 360 Burrito pricy? Of course, it's in an airport. Everything is overpriced in airports."}
{"text":"Tiniest burrito I've ever had.  They should call it the $10 taco.  Go to Moe's by A gates, twice the food.  I have been to burrito places where they give you 3x the burrito at half the cost which means they are overcharging by 600%.

REALLY disappointed with the RIPOFF."}
{"text":"For under $10, I got two tacos, beans and rice that were way better than I expected for airport food. They also assured me that the chicken taco plate was gluten free!"}
{"text":"A nice alternative to the sub-standard fare usually found at airports, but only if you break my cardinal rule about ordering what is in the name of the establishment (burritos in this case). I opted for the grilled chicken burrito bowl with teriyaki sauce, jasmine rice and vegetables. For airport food, this place gets very high marks."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I got the signature \"360 Gourmet Burrito\" with chicken and it was hot, tasty, and filled with quality ingredients and sophisticated flavors. Minus one star for the ambience and zombie like demeanor of staff. Definitely best fast airport food I've had in as long as I can remember."}
{"text":"This is basic burritos at a premium price. There's nothing gourmet about it. For the price, you get more fillers (beans, rice) than meat. It was salty. 

This is what you get for being hungry in this terminal!"}
{"text":"I would give them zero stars. After standing in line for ten minutes the cashier yells that they are only accepting cash. 5 minutes later when we got to the register we were told we could only order a regular chicken or steak burrito or taco or quesadilla. When I asked the reason I was told that they were only allowing customers order what they knew the price of because the computer wasn't working. Hint to the manager. TEACH YOUR PEOPLE THIRD GRADE MATH!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The customer service is non existent. And when I ordered my food, the girl literally cut my order off to point out a person passing by, giggle and then keep talking about them while I was standing there. Then, when I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken, she was so inattentive that she asked me if I ordered steak twice and I had to repeat chicken three times in literally less than thirty seconds. Come on girl, you can't be that dumb, you're just bad at your job. Half of these people here need to be fired. Extremely unprofessional. If you hate your job, leave it...but I guess no one would hire these people anyway. Did I mention the food sucks?"}
{"text":"Average airport burrito. I got the steak regular burrito for $9.49 or something like that. Food came out quick and the employees were nice."}
{"text":"Stood in line for 15 minutes to place my burrito order. I ordered a traditional beef burrito with no rice and no lettuce. Waited in the filthy waiting area and looked at the prep area and it was no better. There are 4 people working and only 2 people doing work. My burrito came with rice. Bland, no salsa and no flavor. Soda machine does't dispense water so you have to go into the hallway to get water. I got my money back. Go some place else for better food."}
{"text":"The Vegas airport is lacking in food options so I headed here for a burrito before my flight. 

I have to agree with the other reviewers on the staff. They were very slow and didn't seem to care how fast they made an order, etc. 

I waited like 20 minutes for the burrito bowl which was lacking in substance. Wasn't worth the money or the wait."}
{"text":"The worst burrito I have ever eaten. 

Like others have previously said, the burrito I had (steak) had no flavor. The steak was at the bottom of the burrito so most of the burrito I ate consisted of beans and rice. I found it interesting they charged extra for cheese as seeing that's a core ingredient in a burrito. I didn't experience any rudeness from the staff so that's what earns the 1 star. Other than that, I'd avoid this place all together. I just wish I had checked Yelp before ordering this mess."}
{"text":"I know airport food is typically not that great but not all of it has to be this bad. 360 burrito was some of the worst food I have ever tasted anywhere.  I find it hard to believe that this place is still open. 

First, you pay a fortune to get food that is tasteless at best.  The chicken was incredibly dry and devoid of any taste.  We got the burrito and the tacos and threw away the majority of it because it was disgusting.  

Please do yourselves a favor and NEVER eat here.  Einstein bagels is right around the corner and you won't end up with terrible food."}
{"text":"Service is horrible here. And the food is the same. Ordered steak bowl and the steak was tasteless, and Burnt. When I told them, she said there is no way it could taste that way. Saved your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have spent many a time at airport restos and I'm pleasantly surprised whenever I find unique items on menus because it suggests that the business owner is trying to think outside the box.  On a recent trip, I found 360 Gourmet and was excited to partake.  Unfortunately, this resto manages to take a good concept and royally mess it up.  The concept: choose your own protein (including tofu) or veggie; prepared in a style you want (bowl, burrito, wrap, etc.); with a sauce of your choosing (thai, indian curry, etc.), and voila!  I was excited when I saw the bevy of options (shrimp, tofu, veggies) for non-meat eaters... until I found out that there was no shrimp.  Well, no mind... I'll go with tofu and some veggies.  Can I get that with thai sauce? Sure, says the lady who is making my order.... but then manages to also serve my thai tofu/veggie bowl with a heaping helping of guac. and sour cream...which I didn't discover until I opened the bowl, anxious to dig in.  After paying (almost $13!!) for my meal and a regular cup for diet soda, what I found in my bowl looked like vomit.  Literally.  I mean, I was ready to throw out the bowl on looks alone.  And then I tried it... and so did my man... and it tasted as bad as it looked.   I am shocked and dismayed at the quality of 360 GB and would recommend airport travelers to look elsewhere in McCarren to get some eats."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. It was dry and tasteless even after drenching it with sauce. Better off going across the hall to Einstein's."}
{"text":"Just another horrible airport dining experience. You pay $10 for a burrito and you get a tasteless, crunchy meat burrito where cheese is a buck extra and they forget the cheese anyway... Service is as horrible as the food - the $4 Aquafina is the best part of the meal at this place. Stay away. Grab yourself a bag of nuts at Hudson News instead. In fact that's usually your best option at any airport."}
{"text":"Great food, tacos were fresh, the counter service was courteous and helpful. It's in the B Concourse."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself stuck at the B Concourse at McCarrens, well then...I'm sorry. Saying that the dining options there are limited is an understatement. I had a layover in Vegas on a flight from Chicago to SF and was actually excited that my flight was taking off through the B Concourse, having previously exhausted all of the choices at the C Concourse. That excitement turned to disappointment when I found that there were only really two places to eat at the B end. I opted for 360 Gourmet, a burrito place that seemed to have limitless custom options.

I was pretty hungry, so I ordered the burrito bowl with sautéed shrimp. Feeling particularly daring, I opted to \"Jazz it up\" Thai style, which cost more but promised carrots, jasmine rice, and peanut dressing. That should be good, right? I also ordered chips and salsa. No drink. It was close to $17.

I was impressed that the food is actually prepared fresh right there on a series of burners. I was cautiously optimistic. But when I got my food things changed. First of all, the bowl was very small. Now I recognize that as a culture we tend to overindulge when in comes to cheap food by consuming oversized portions of food, but this was ridiculous, especially considering the cost. I took the bowl back to my ledge (they don't have tables or chairs) then realized that I had not yet received my chips, so I went back to the counter.

\"Can I please get my chips?\" The woman at the counter looked at my quizzically.

\"Oh,\" she replied. \"I didn't know you wanted chips. I didn't hear you, so I didn't charge you.\"

I went back to my ledge and came back with the receipt that clearly showed that she had both ordered and charged me for chips. Without saying a word, she went to the back and dumped a handful of chips in a paper bag.

Ok, now on to the shrimp bowl. It was bland and tasteless. But wait, what about the peanut sauce? And the carrots? I looked the bowl over closely and went back to the counter.

\"Is this Thai style?\" I asked.

\"Yes.\"

\"Where's the peanut sauce? And the carrots?\"

\"It's in there.\" Well she could've told me that she also threw in some lobster because there was as much lobster in my bowl as there was peanut sauce. So either she lied, she didn't know any better, or their food is so bad that the sauce is entirely unrecognizable.

Either way, I couldn't finish the bowl, despite its small size. It just wasn't worth eating.

This review may seem a bit on the harsh side, but seriously - if you find yourself at the B gates, then walk over to the C gates. The food options aren't great but they are miles ahead of this slop they try to pass of at 360 Gourmet. If you don't have time then go to the Einsteins across the way and buy a prepackaged chicken wrap. You'll be happy you did...

Needless to say, I will not be back. I'm half guessing that this place will be out of business within the year anyway."}
{"text":"My arrival at LAS experience has always been different than when I'm Leaving Las Vegas. Maybe like a gambler's experience as everything looks so new, shiny, and hopeful coming in, and so tired and worn heading home. 

I didn't gamble a cent during my recent trip here and was still happy to be getting out of town. However, I made a mistake thinking that if I got to the airport early, I'd find find a lounge, grab a beer and some food, and relax while waiting for the plane. WRONG. Once past Security (as least for Southwest flights), there's virtually nothing here. I initially sat down at the Fox \"Sports Bar\", but after being ignored and not finding the draft or food selection worthy, went to the gate for a choice between 360 Gourmet Burrito and Einstein Noah's Bagels. 

The Burrito Bowl was reasonably good and the food came out fast and hot.  That was 15 minutes well spent. Unfortunately, more than an hour remained until boarding, and LAS can be a lonely place at the Gate."}
{"text":"I work at the airport and when I don't bring a lunch, I always go to 360. They are in the B gate and are impossible to miss.

There is a little seating and counter space to put your luggage. Well lit and smells pretty good. 

The food is pricey but it's aiport food. It's lways expensive. Menu is big and a little confusing but it's not too bad. I get the 360 chicken. It's always good. The cashiers speak fluent English and Spanish. 

I'd suggest this to anyone stuck in the airport on a lay over or early for their flight in or around the B gate."}
{"text":"This place was so awful.  The husband and I had a layover in Vegas.  Luckily, we were indecisive and decided to split a burrito from here and then decide if was worth another $9 burrito.  For such high cost, I'd expect Chipotle sized, but it was not at all.  We ordered a thai burrito and it was so disappointing.  

The staff was not friendly and they charge for everything.  Pretty much if it's not listed in your burrito, they're going to charge for it - even common things like sour cream or cheese.  Pretty much, unless this your only option for food, save yourself and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Quick stop for food in the gate area, won't make you sick, but no where near decent food."}
{"text":"This location in the airport is trash. The meat (steak) was sooooooooo damnnnnnnnn dry the flour tortilla was even hard WTF. It's like the food had been sitting out for days. Not to mention we asked for salsa they only had green and even that was even a cream white / green color we tried it and I had to hawk a luggie it tasted so rancid."}
{"text":"Well, the staff could be friendlier, but what do you expect from an airport, primarily to-go food, in Vegas later in the evening, right?  

Look, it's an AIRPORT.  And a not-so-new one on top of that.  Food is pricier than outside the airport in general.  They won't have the best staff in the world (like friggin DUH).  It's in VEGAS, they are serving tons of silly drunk travellers which I'm sure is NOT very fun to deal with.  

I usually have really high standards for service and hospitality, but, in this case, I say give them a f*ckin break.

Why am I giving them this many stars?  Well, their food was really good.  I expected to pay quite a bit because it's in an airport, and yet, the taste of their burrito actually exceeded my expectations.

I ordered a Garlic Lime burrito with prawns, with a bottle of water.  The burrito had a perfect balance of tangy lime and a bit of heat, with Spanish (tomato based ) rice and grilled prawns, all wrapped up, piping hot.  

Honestly, I would pay a few extra bucks to eat their burrito over other typical airport food any day.

The only thing I wish they had, were more fresh/healthy side selections.  I would have loved to tack on a little side salad or a fruit bowl to my order but I didn't see any.  But still, I didn't feel too guilty about my food choice, especially compared to Mega-Chain junk food places also stationed in this airport.

Hence, my first experience at 360 Gourmet Burrito results in a pretty happy 4 stars.  Will totally buy food from them again the next time I am stopping by this airport."}
{"text":"Ok for fast food option.  I got a burrito of grilled chicken, Garlic lime Spanish rice, beans, pico de gallo, and lettuce.  Burritos are not very large...on the skinnier side, but ingredients seem to be fairly fresh."}
{"text":"How do you run out of pico AND all salsa at the same time? Plus, the girl behind the counter said they keep asking and the don't receive any. Such a shame. The food is good but I need a little SPICE with my Mexican food."}
{"text":"The steak in my burrito is actually gray, the rice is over-salted, the portion is small and to claim this place is \"fresh\" or \"healthy\" is laughable! One of my saddest airport dining experiences ever."}
{"text":"A surprising little find at McCarran International  when I was agonizing over waking up at 4.30 to catch a 7am flight. 

Tofu breakfast Tacos....yes....not on the menu but ask for it. With a greasy ranchero sauce and a flour burrito wrapped around the grilled soft tofu this was uplifting in the morning. I had cheese on mine (oh my) but you could easily veganize this without. 

I thought that was as lucky as I could have gotten...and then I tried their Medium Red Salsa (note: they have a pretty decent salsa bar). Heaven on earth. The combination of the tofu taco and the salsa set the tone for my gastronomical adventure on the trip to come. I also needed a pack of gum right after.

Their menu of tacos/burritos/bowls is extensive and there are many veggie options that include tofu. The people working here were very sweet and helpful. Note that the taco I had was rather greasy and I didn't necessarily like that part of it. 

Considering the airport generally sucks for any meal option for the vegetarian/vegan, 360 definitely helps even out the equilibrium. In relation to other airport establishments I'd give 360 a 5 star review. But in relation to other restaurants, 360 would have to get a 3. 

I have to say that my tofu breakfast taco with a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks made this flight a lot more bearable. 

(360 is located near the B gates - Southwest)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Go somewhere, anywhere else. Burritos are overpriced and small. Staff is barely friendly and poor quality all around. Go to another terminal and search out other food options"}
{"text":"Located in McCarran airport, this place was one of the few dining options that looked appetizing. They've got all sorts of burrito combinations consisting of different ingredients and sauces (cajun, Thai, teriyaki, curry, mediterranean). You can also get burrito bowls, salads, wraps, quesadillas, and sandwiches. The steak and prawns burrito I ordered was decent. There was plenty of juicy, well flavored steak, but the prawns were tiny and rubbery. As with all airport dining options, prepare to pay up the wazoo for something that should cost half as much as they charge."}
{"text":"Why is it that all the chain restaurants become a lot suckier once they are in airports? 
I had the spinach chicken burrito and it was super greasy and salty. It was probably the greasiest burrito I had ever had. And yes, it was overpriced just like the other airport food. 

At least the salsa at the salsa bar was still fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This food is disgusting! The airport should be ashamed to have such a terrible restaurant in their midst!  I should have known it was horrific food based on the fact that they put thousand island on their quesadillas.... but I got a traditional burrito with grilled steak.  Um, pot roast is not grilled steak.  And it was seasoned like it was New England pot roast.  I threw it away.  Stay away! Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Came here 830am and they only offer a breakfast burrito or quesasilla. They only had beef and ham options at 9 bucks plus apple juice 2 bucks. Though the menu showed upgrades for chicken or steak and spicy potatoes and spinach those have been on hold for sometime. They gave me a sauce not mentioned in the menu nor did I ask for that was bitter. This was possibly famous in the past for its unique menu

Food:My breakfast egg, cheese and regular potatoes not spicy was ok and was two mini slices.

Service : Getting a yawn of bad breathe was not appealing. 

Price:Overpriced even for airport pricing on the food."}
{"text":"Oh airport food, why you have to be so bad...yet so good.
Big burrito's. Sloppy nachos. 
Best choice for eats in the B concourse, but be prepared for some stomach grumblings afterwards...in a good way...sort of.
I will try not to make it a habit to eat here, but only because I know bad habits are hard to break. 
I like cheese."}
{"text":"Should have checked reviews before ordering - so at the 360 at gates B9-15 at McCarran, I waited through four customers after me to ask where my order was. Thania gestured to the one wrap on the counter and looked at me like I was an idiot. I told her there were two on the order. She pulled the receipt and without a word of apology started the second. When I mentioned her serving four people ahead of me she said \"just calm down,\" with a patronizing smile. 

The correct response when you screw up an order and make a customer wait (especially in an airport) is \"I'm sorry sir/madam, I'll get that right out for you\" instead of reacting like the customer is unreasonable to be upset for the clerk'
s mistake. Maybe management will be able to help Thania with her customer service. 

(Saving the wrap for the flight, so I can't speak to the quality of the food.)"}
{"text":"Food is okay but do not order from here unless you have at least half an hour to spare. Had to abandon one (of two) of my burrito bowls today after 15 minutes because my flight was loading. There were only two people in front of me, and one of those guys was about to have to abandon part of his order too. Now I get to look forward to a packet of stale peanuts for dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure why the so cruddy reviews.. I got the beef bowl (a burrito without the tortilla) doused it with hot green sauce and was happy as a clam.. Service was quick and I left with a smile.."}
{"text":"What was in the green salsa that gave it a nail polish remover after taste? The tortilla chips were ok. Not that this 2-star review will do any good, this place is located at the Southwest Terminal at McCarran, they'll get business no matter what."}
{"text":"Buy a burrito somewhere else - complete garbage.  $15 for a \"super\" burrito and a water - the burrito was the size of a taco bell 7 layer burrito.  Sour cream and guac???  Though ordered, they must have run through this burrito in track shoes because those ingredients were outta there.

Ya feel me??"}
{"text":"The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  

This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:

Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99
Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19

Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier \"I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?\"  She said \"No\" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, \"Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter\".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  

I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.

That does it for me, I will never eat here again.

Return Factor - 0%"}
{"text":"I give this place a 1 because zero is not an option. 

Inconsiderate customer service. I asked when the restaurant closed the worker told me 9. I return at 8:30 and they tell me they are no long doing sauté (basically no grill). I explained that the worker I asked didn't tell me that when I was in the restaurant 1 hour and a half prior. They both basically said \"oh\" and looked at me. I told them that they should let customers know that the grill closes 30 min earlier. And again,  blank stares and maybe a head nod.  According to previous reviews the food is not good so I wouldn't waste your."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of burritos in my day. That was hands down the worst yet.   Shameful"}
{"text":"Oh Satan, why. Why did you have to open this upcharging-dishonest-mess-of-a-menu spot? I never write one-star reviews, but what a horrendous experience. I kind of felt bad for the guy behind the counter being berated by practically everyone, but my lort, I understand their rage. I didn't receive any of the sides that came with my meal (beans, rice, pico, sour cream) and was upcharged for meat that already comes with the damn order. What kind of fresh hell is this? Options are limited Terminal B9-15, but steer clear and get a bagel from Einstein Bros. or something."}
{"text":"The young girl working at this place should be fired immediately. Not only was she rude and nasty to the people working with her, berating them in front of customers, she refused to fulfill a simple request, which was to add peppers to a cheese quesadilla as I do not eat meat. No where on the menu was a cheese quesadilla. When I ordered my quesadilla without meat, I was ordering what was on the menu, without meat. I got only a quesadilla with no sides. When I inquired about the sides she was extremely rude and dismissive and said I didn't get them. I had to pay as much for a side of rice and sour cream as my quesadilla after arguing with her and then watching her once again berate the poor cashier. This girl noes ZERO about service. If this is a representation of this company it's a disgusting representation. She acted like a little brat throwing a tantrum because she was busy and focused on order time instead of customer service. Nasty. Disgusting. And I cannot believe she's allowed to interact with other human beings."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but well worth it. It is like Chipotle, but has many more choices. I enjoyed my burrito and will eat there again."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible burrito.  I had the chicken burrito and it was incredibly dry and flavorless.  Do yourself a favor and do not eat here.  Taco Bell is \"gourmet\" in comparison. Yech!"}
{"text":"The name is 360 gourmet burrito but there is nothing gourmet about it ... And 360 is the angle they have turned an easy burrito and made a mess of it. I got a burrito bowl ( that came in a plate with a huge cover n soo less food ) n neither was my hunger satisfied and boy my taste bud hated me for trying it...Go have a bagel next door.. you will be a loooooooooooot better off... Chicago Midway has a similar place n for similar price they have Moore food n Better food if we were to compare airport food ... The chicken was nth Like I tasted Before..N in a badd way ... The 1 star is for its location ..It was right next to my boarding gate .."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Not worth it. I paid almost $13 for a small bowl of rice, beans, and chicken and unfortunately, it wasn't very tasty. I would probably rather have walked down the airport walkway to Starbucks and laid $10 for one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"It actually wasn't terrible. To be honest, I expected to hate this place, but I didn't. I was starving and in a terrible mood due to canceled and delayed flights. I originally wanted something with shrimp, but they were all out of that (I don't blame them, it was almost closing time), so I ended up getting the burrito bowl with steak, as well as chips and guacamole. My food came out really fast. The chips were a tad too salty for me, but overall not bad. I felt that the guacamole needed onions and more lime, though, but I was surprised that it actually looked like guacamole (basically I had very low expectations for this place). The portion was surprisingly huge for my appetizer. As for my burrito bowl, I thought it actually tasted pretty darn good. The meat was tender and flavorful. The only thing I would change in that meal is the rice. For some reason it tasted really smoky for Mexican rice and I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be like that. The beans were good, though, if you're into that. As a bonus, I did not get food poisoning, which I also expected, so...hooray for that!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. The rice and beans are vegan which is awesome for plant based folks. And service was super fast."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Entered with three employees dillydallying. Undercooked chicken and shrimp. Told me to throw it away and wait to the side. Took 30 minutes to process credit card refund. Unapologetic."}
{"text":"All you need to know is DRIED AND BLAND. My burrito tasted like cardboard. If you've placed cardboard in your mouth, you know what I mean. Texture was similar too. 

Oh and they forgot my order. I stood there for 10 mins then someone realized I didn't have my order."}
{"text":"Located within the B terminal.  I ordered the 360 chicken burrito, with rice, lettuce and beans.  At 9.49, I was surprised the cheese and sour cream were extra, so I charged on without them.   The size was good, she had so heft to her.  It was just a little dry, but not bad.  It's the airport so for some reason it's ok so stuff to be sub par, if your hungry you could do worse.  Even being dry, it seems like the ingredients were fresh at least, you could do allot worse."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE
I wish I could give negative stars

My boyfriend and I both got food poisoning, we ate there 11/28/11. 
The only thing our meals had in common was the beans. 
I also reported it with the southern las vegas health board.

Ew.


& I'm not even going to waste my time talking about the service. The girl working the register was super rude."}
{"text":"They botched my order for a burrito bowl and made a (very loosely packed and lightly filled) burrito. Not a big deal, petty really. The solution was to dump the insides into a bowl. The end. No effort to make a new one, and a couple ingredients were left out too. Airport food is already overpriced, and this was dreadful. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE. GET A BAGEL 10FT AWAY.

In summary:
- terrible customer service
- small portions
- poor problem solving skills
- missing ingredients"}
{"text":"For a place that has the word \"burrito\" in the name, you'd think the burritos were actually tasty....not the case.  However, I must preface this review by saying I've only tried one burrito here.

I was crunched for time at the airport, hungry and 360 Gourmet Burrito was literally next to my gate.  I originally wanted the rice, bean & cheese burrito, but was told they were out of beans. Hmmm, really? A burrito place that's out of beans pretty early in the afternoon? Ok.  So, I decided to be adventurous and try the Thai Burrito.  It was carrots, jasmine rice & spicy peanut sauce with my choice of protein (I opted for tofu).  It also had grilled peppers and onions.

After paying $12 for a burrito and a drink, I was optimistic that it would be a nice taste-bud deviation from the standard burrito.  After one bite, I was HUGELY disappointed! The entire burrito was completely overwhelmed with the sauce, which didn't taste a thing like peanuts, but a lot like crushed red pepper. You couldn't appreciate any of the flavors of the other ingredients.  Truly a let down.  I managed 3 bites because I was really trying to like it, but it didn't happen.  It ended up in the garbage and I got on my plane still hungry.

 In my experience, anytime the word \"gourmet\" is used in a restaurant name or to describe a food item, run fast and run hard! I just want food.  Food that is tasty and food that satisfies.  Next time I'm at the Vegas airport, I'll seek out other food options, this place is not getting my business again!"}
{"text":"How do you mess up a breakfast quesadilla? Cheese, scrambled eggs, and sausage in a tortilla... Sounds easy enough but somehow it tasted soooooo disgusting. Totally not worth the $7."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful weekend in Vegas. Time to catch a flight and decided get a bite to eat. Too early in the morning to be greeted with nastiness. Brenda if you cannot be pleasant to the customers who pay for your salary, then you (Brenda) should choose a job that does not involve interactions or interfacing with customers."}
{"text":"I was in the restroom in the terminal and an employee walked right out of a stall past the sinks without washing her hands. I followed her out, and she went right back to work. Bleh! Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"360 Gourmet Burrito is not a bad chain, but this location is awful. Pretty much any on-airport alternative would be better. Unfortunately, the B9-B15 gate area has only two options, this and Einstein Bagels, and neither has anywhere to sit and eat. 360 has some uncomfortable standing positions only.  

I ordered a quesadilla with cheese, guacamole,  and steak. What was served to me was a grilled, nearly-burnt tortilla with cheese and a little steak folded into it. No seasonings (the quesadilla is supposed to have tomato, oregano, cilantro, red onion, diced garlic & jalapenos, but all had been omitted. As was the guacamole, for which I had paid extra, and the salsa. And weirdly, it was served in a bowl.  

I took it away to try to find somewhere to eat, and only then realized what I had received. Took it back, was given a tiny condiment cup of guacamole and one of salsa. The cashier was completely distracted and got the order wrong, and had trouble making $12.07 change from a $20.  The cook apparently did not know how to make the menu item.  I had about 1/4 of the \"quesadilla\" and threw the rest away. 

If I could give 0 stars, this place deserves it. There's a nice Mexican place in the C gates (Jose Cuervo Tequileria) as well as Pei Wei Asian diner. I have had good meals at both.  But avoid this place at all costs.  I will be writing 360's corporate office to tell them that their chain is very badly represented at LAS."}
{"text":"Really bad. I'm a vegetarian and they didn't offer any alternative, even though they offer fajita veggies and jalapeños. But ok no big deal...but they didn't give any extra rice or beans with that $10 meal. They forgot the salsa, and doused my food in sour cream to the point that the whole dish was cold. I threw about half of it away. I come through the Vegas airport a lot...will avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"$12 burrito that tastes like garbage, no thanks! My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish ours. All we could taste was the jalapeños and the red onions!! We tossed it and walked over to Burger King...best decision ever."}
{"text":"Should've paid more attention to the terrible reviews.  If you want a wrap that is 90% rice & beans and other flavorless toppings, then come here."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Took my order and then told me they did not have what I ordered. Then made me wait to get a refund."}
{"text":"The refrigerator by the entrance and receipt still says 360 Burrito but the only food they offer is the refrigerated prepackage items.  The sign out front has been stripped so you would not know what it was previously.  It is also credit only, no cash.  Better off elsewhere to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Is anybody ever REALLY excited about being stuck eating airport food?  The options are extremely limited, most are unhealthy, and the prices are always significantly higher than you'd find elsewhere with a significantly lower quality of food served.

So imagine my surprise when I discovered a 360 Gourmet Burrito shop during a recent 2 hour layover at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I'd actually eaten at a 360 Gourmet Burrito restaurant in San Ramon, California (Near San Francisco) and really enjoyed to food there, so I entered this restaurant with high hopes  in spite of their two star Yelp rating with over 60 reviews which would normally have caused me to steer clear.

I decided to switch it up and try one of their bowls, and chose the curry bowl with steak that comes sauteed with veggies over rice.  I can't say that it was the best curry bowl I've ever had, but it was still far better than a lot of airport food I've endured.  The steak was not overcooked, the rice was fresh, not starting to dry as if it had been sitting around, and the quantity given was decent.  It was far better than fast food would have been, yet not quite up to my memory of the other 360 Gourmet Burrito location I visited.  

All in all, I don't regret having eaten here and would probably do it again if stuck on another layover here.  Better than your average fast airport food.  There wasn't really anywhere inside you could sit down to eat your food, but my plan was to take it back to the gate to eat so that wasn't really an issue for me."}
{"text":"So I really didn't like the girl at the cash register, and I hated the fact that they were out of a major amount of ingredients and didn't apologize. Fortunately the food was really good, even amazing considering it was airport food. Wonderful and flavorful warm Spanish rice, great beans, your choose of chicken and steak and salsa. 

They're rude but they offer really good food."}
{"text":"If I remember correctly 360 Gourmet Burrito was a pretty decent sized chain in California about 10 years ago that was competing for the same business that Chipotle was getting. I visited a location in Walnut Creek years ago and after a little research it looks like this chain has been whittled down to locations in Walnut Creek, alameda, Lafayette, SF and Vegas. The website appears to be gone. I remembered really liking them as they had different flavors you could add to your protein like Thai, Jamaican, teriyaki etc. 

Anyways, there was a location right by my gate and I was hungry so I took the plunge. The menu does not appeared to have changed much with options like taco, burrito, burrito bowl and salad. They still had the unique flavor combo's I mentioned above (Thai, Jamaican, teriyaki, etc.)

I ordered the Grilled Chicken Salad. It came with Romaine, carrot, red onion, tomato and grilled chicken and I opted for a Balsamic Vinaigrette.

The veggies were nice and fresh and generous. The chicken serving was a joke. So small you could hardly see any. What little I did have was grilled and seasoned nicely.

9 and change for my salad was kind of a rip off. The cashier was very friendly and the food was out quick which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"The steak is so salty that it is almost inedible. The employees are not friendly either. The bowl is only half filled."}
{"text":"Steak and prawn burrito was possibly the worst burrito that I have ever eaten. Tasteless."}
{"text":"The food is awful, but the service is worse. They forgot to make my burrito. When I asked about it, they made it seem like a major inconvenience to make my food. When they did make it, it was incorrect. They were frustrated by my request to correct my order. The food was not fresh, and was so salty it was inedible."}
{"text":"It's in a great location... buuuuut.... 

360 used to be my burrito place. I LOVED alot of what they had, but they changed up their menu, and even though alot of the offerings are similar, and some are the same, it just doesn't have the same zing as it used to. Don't get me wrong, it's still a pretty good burrito place, but it used to be AWESOME. The shrimp used to be big juicy prawns, now they're just dainty little curlymeats. The steak used to be sizzly, garlicky, buttery goodness, now it just seems kinda dry...

There's really nothing else worth eating around here, so I guess it doesn't matter too too much, but I'm still a bit disappointed in the change."}
{"text":"I had a layover and needed to grab and low carb bite.  Wasn't a lot of selection at the airport until  I ran into this place.  INitially I thought it was comparable to Chipotle...boy was I wrong...They offer more options but the quality and quantity failed.  I ordered the salad bowl with steak (garlic lime dressing) and added guacamole.  The food was prepped fast.  My first biggest disappointment was the size.  For over $8.00, it came in a tiny bowl.  The steaks were really small.  My guac (whiched I paid extra for)  actually took up most of the top.  The dressing flavor was good.  Just wished it was a bigger portion."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Las Vegas and Was choosing this location to eat lunch at. At first glance everything looked great. I asked for a regular burrito with no jalapeño and no onion and she even checked twice that I didn't want jalapeño that I was super thankful for. Then she charged me for extra jalapeño and I even said wait why am I being charged for this when I said I didn't want it. She said she just won't add it. I said \"why did you charge me for it then.\" She proceeds do say she will give me my .55 cents back it had nothing to do with the money it was the fact she knew she charged me for it and when I called her out on it she tried blowing it off. I then proceeded to ask the lady making the burrito if they had a Facebook I wanted to see if anybody else had a bad experience and she rudely said \"if you want to complain somewhere just call the number on the bottom of your receipt and tell them.\" The people behind me in line even said she was rude as heck. The ended up taking the food back without trying it and the manager was super nice and handled he situation wonderfully as the cashier glared at me. I own my own business and was in the military for 4 years I can deal with people being assholes but when it's the employees that treat you like shit that's an issue."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place to get a vegan option in the B-Gates at McCarran.  I found this by accident after reading my boarding pass wrong (score! although I knew of its existence from Sangeetha's review.)  Anyway, you can get tofu in your tacos, burrito, salad, whatever.  Mix veggies are also an option.  I got a black bean and rice burrito with tofu.  It was small and crazy overpriced at ~$9, but it was perfectly fine tasting, especially after adding their hot green salsa.  Definitely check it out if you're in need of some vegan friendly protein!"}
{"text":"I know airport food is SKY.....HIGH but at least have some GOOD customer service. Jackie the cashier has the WORST........attitude EVER! BAD enough her English is NOT that clear and she's treating me like I got a HEARING problem! The burrito with 5 pieces of OVER COOKED DRIED STEAK was the NASTIEST. SPENDING ALMOST $15.00 on a terrible burrito with a AWFUL person working the money part hurts....!"}
{"text":"There breakfast burrito's are terrible.  I ordered 2 and it cost me $14. Spend $2 at McDonalds and it will taste better."}
{"text":"If you need to eat. It's does it's job. It tastes like dog good. I thought the burrito bowl with guacamole. Came out to under $10. I've had way better airport food but given the time .. it was in geast-able. Still would go back if I needed food in this terminal area."}
{"text":"Disgusting. And over priced, even for Las Vegas. $16 for a tiny meatless quesadilla with some nasty sauce and sour cream guac, and a small fountain drink. Makes Taco Bell look like a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Wrong and bad - sometimes when you say that about a burrito you mean that in a good way. This is not one of those times. They shouldn't even be allowed to call what's served here a burrito because that implies delicious eats - they should be forced to call it Bland Tasteless Crap.

Even by airport food standards, 360 is able to achieve remarkable new lows. It's expensive as all get out and you may as well be eating a picture of a burrito for all the flavor the food has. Even with the addition of jalepenos (extra charge, of course!) and two containers of hot salsa my chicken burrito tasted of...not much.

I wish I could tell you that you can do better, but honestly you probably can't."}
{"text":"Had 45 min to wait and an empty slightly hungover stomach so I stopped at 360 for some food. Ordered the Cajun chicken burrito. The line was really long. It was 10:45 so they had a spike in traffic.  May have been a bad choice give the state of my stomach but it was blah. The ingredients were cooked fresh so you are eating \"real\" food but again taste was mediocre. Oh and it wasn't cheap but given the location that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Terrible. $11  for a small bowl which was quarter full (burrito bowl). Joke.
 
I got the burrito bowl with the Thai flavor sauce and chicken. I understand airport food is expensive but I think this lady measured a shot-glass of rice and counted 7 small chicken pieces to add to my burrito. The bowl was about the size you would see for an appetizer soup at a restaurant. Joke.

I asked if I could maybe get a small serving of beans added to the bowl, obviously it was an extra couple dollars."}
{"text":"One word: AVOID. Zero Stars if possible.  

For what I spent, I could have had a real gourmet sandwich or salad at Wolfgang Puck's cart!  

$9 for a salad of a handful of lettuce (I asked to more and the guy grudgingly gave me a few more pieces of the iceberg lettuce with an admonition that he really wasn't supposed to give me more!), and a sprinkling of chopped over-cooked chicken. Thank goodness there was a bit of rice and black beans underneath otherwise the order would have been really dry!  There are plenty of other places in the airport with better food and service than this dirty burrito place. 

Note to self: don't expect great service or people working in Las Vegas, esp at the airport."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast burrito with grilled chicken, a $1.49 add on. It took 5 minutes to make, so they get a star for speed. The size of the burrito was small for what I am use to, but thinking about my waistline it was the perfect size for one person.

The shell tasted like an off the shelf mission tortilla shell, which is not appealing to me. The homemade unique sauce was good but there was not enough of it and the chicken was ok. Overall, it seems like the burritos are sub-par, but only if you get all the upgrades such as the lime rice and guacamole which makes it very expensive at the airport.

I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you don't like the other options available. If this existed outside of the airport, I don't think it would be successful unless the price was very low."}
{"text":"I should have gotten a discount for the $3.19 for a bottle of water since I waited for the young staff of five behind the counter to stop talking smack about their so-called friends before I was acknowledged. Just passing through..."}
{"text":"Located inside the Las Vegas airport, 360 Gourmet Burrito is refreshing. One of the worst things in the world about traveling is the lack of decent, healthy food in airports. There is nothing worse than getting off an ugly early morning flight covered with that airport funk feeling, and having to choose between McDonald's and Chili's Express for lunch. 

Luckily, in Vegas you have options. At least in the C gates (I think).

The menu is very unique and has lots of options - asian, curry, mexican, meat, really the combinations are endless. The staff was refreshingly (for an airport) friendly, and helpful. When I tried to order a curry veggie wrap, the guy actually said he wouldn't recommend it because it would be soggy - go with the burrito instead. 

I listened to his advice and was glad - the wrap was amazing, and I was stuffed, ready to take a nap on my second flight. 

If you have a layover, it is worth it to search this place out, believe me."}
{"text":"Not at all gourmet. Just your standard tortilla filled with the standard items like burrito beans cheese sour cream rice. I asked for a vegetarian burrito and it was pretty bland. No special sauces. Would not try this again. Also very expensive."}
{"text":"The food is gross and rotten-tasting, the employees all seem to be very miserable and are extremely rude, everything is way overpriced and the portions are very small though that may be a good thing because if I had eaten more of their food I probably would've gotten sick.  Avoid if you can!"}
{"text":"For a breakfast burrito it was ok - quick and hot. It is in an airport it is expansive but the employees were nice and quick. The place is clean and that is all you can ask for really."}
{"text":"Broccoli, tofu and mushrooms at McCarran: given the context, this is an acceptable option. Would I go to the airport to dine here? Heck no, but given that the food options at the Vegas airport are weak, this was a needed meal stop. It is definitely not the same level as Chipotle or Cafe Rio; they don't have choose your own toppings, which is odd. No lettuce. No cilantro or onions. My bowl was literally broccoli, tofu, mushrooms and black beans, and the servings were not what I consider generous given the less than cheap pricing. However, I did feel it was healthy. They do have some salsas you can grab to spice things up a bit. I suggest doing that. 

It will do in an aiport pinch, and the staff was friendly. They initially messed up my order for a bowl and gave me a burrito. When I pointed out the mistake, they happily corrected their mistake and let me keep the extra burrito. Sadly, it didn't get eaten, but I felt safe knowing I had sustenance for my flight if needed."}
{"text":"I was doing the low carb thing and was struggling to find suitable food at our airport. The burrito bowl at 360 *seemed* like a decent option. The prices were ridiculous, but I'm ok with this at an airport. I was bummed the food was so awful, however. The meat was tasteless, the toppings were bland, and overall it was very sad. I enjoy dishes like this at Cafe Rio, Chipotle, or Zabas but this place was far, far worse. You expect bad food at the airport but even for airport food this was disappointing."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible. 0 flavor and EXPENSIVE!  I hope they replace this place with a Chipotle"}
{"text":"Yup. Probably should have checked the stars. Wow. These minimum wage workers won't even tell you what burritos they packed. I got a steak, and a bacon. They literally just threw the burritos on the counter. When I asked what was what, they gave me some serious attitude like I should have X-ray vision into aluminum foil. I had asked the stupidest question in the world apparently. 

I haven't even eaten their burritos and they made me feel like throwing up. When I asked if they could cut my burrito in half, they told me to get a knife at einsteins bagels. If I could imagine worse service I wouldn't be able to. Their manager must be so proud."}
{"text":"Since you cannot bring your own water into the airport, I stopped at 360 Gourmet Burrito to buy a bottle of water and a bag of M & M's.  

I think it's a disgrace that because we are a captive audience, they can charge $3.29 for the water and $3.29 for the M & M's.  To add to the disgrace, the lack of a pleasant employee!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Shrimp tacos, tasted terrible to say the least. The tacos will cost you $10 yet will be the size of tacos you can
get for $1 on a taco Tuesday. The sauce tasted unnatural and like it was made in a chemistry lab."}
{"text":"It was horrible! I ordered a classic steak burrito and it was the worst I've had in my life!  The meat was so dry and burnt it was crunchy... I can still taste the bitter burnt meat 15 mins after I threw it away... Never going there again.

If I had enough time to complain I would have... Unfortunately my flight was here..."}
{"text":"This place was really busy when I was at the airport.  I needed a quick bite to eat before flying home and their menu had a good variety of items especially because I was on a diet.

I ordered a shrimp burrito with veggies, it was actually pretty good.  Ingredients were freshly cooked, which took a bit longer than I expected but it was worth the wait.

Prices are reasonable for the airport.  Service was okay.  It did take them 20 minutes however to get customers napkins!"}
{"text":"Ick. Saltiest food ever. 

They were accommodating with changes but my goodness, I was so parched on the flight I couldn't wait for the beverage service to start. Too much sodium. Completely unnecessary- will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was hungry and this was the only spot I had time for lol.

The dude taking orders was probably the nicest dude. Real helpful asked how I was doing helped me with my food. Service was great but the food is just ok. Nothing special just good enough to get you by. I ordered the burrito bowl."}
{"text":"B terminal near B9-B12 there is a burrito shop w/hot and healthy meals. 
The service is fairly fast and the good is fresh. 
No seats, so you'll have to stand. 
The food prices are fair, but $3.45 for a 20oz water is robbery."}
{"text":"Worst steak burrito, ever.  Worst $9 spent. Barely any meat. All I tasted was the tortilla. The meat was dry, but what can you expect from an airport restaurant? I should have ate burger king. Yuck."}
{"text":"Hey, when you get up at 5 am to catch a flight out to the bay area.......most times you won't have a chance to grab a bite to eat your hotel.
This is where airport food comes into play.........

Gang, when you deal with airport food.......you know very well you will be rolling the dice! 

First hand...........the food will be expensive, and usually it's lousy! But hey, you have the option of not buying it.........it's either expensive lousy food, or you can eat air! 

For me, I like expensive lousy airport food when you're hungry. In fact, I've eaten my share of airport food though the years...........as my job had taken me all over the U.S., so I've sort of gotten accustomed to expensive lousy airport food.

While I was waiting to catch my flight to San Jose the other day, I spotted a joint called - \"360 Gourmet Burrito\".

What can I say, two words which caught my eye.........

1. Gourmet - Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing! Gourmet leads me to believe it's gourmet food (but who am I kidding!)

2. Burrito - I love Mexican food, so burrito.........especially a breakfast burrito sounded good to me.

And what did I get gang?

I got an EXPENSIVE LOUSY burrito! Lol! 

All kidding aside..........it was maybe a 1/2 star above a lousy burrito! Good for at least a 3 1/2 star rating.
At best, the food was just average.........but this place was a lot better than the other airport dumps I've been to in Las Vegas like - Auntie Anne's, or Baja Fresh!

For $15.00 bucks, I got a burrito, & two cups of coffee. 

I must say.........the coffee was really good,..........only because this place did not make coffee. They sell you the cup, and you go across the way to another business called Einstein's Bros. Bagel to get your coffee. 

And I gotta say.......MAN! They make some really good coffee! I'm impressed, as it's in the airport too!"}
{"text":"I would like to say that this was good, because the service was much friendlier than I ever experience at airport foodservice outlets, but the breakfast burrito this morning was a real letdown. The biggest issue was the temperature of the eggs and sausage (held on a steam table before building the burrito) were lukewarm, and so, when we got our food, the whole burrito was lukewarm and unappetizing. Again, though, I must say that the ladies behind the counter (one Filipina and one African American) were both all smiles and friendly, even though they were obviously stuck in the breakfast rush of a bunch of businessmen trying to make flights..."}
{"text":"What a waste of time.. Twice the price of similar restaurants, half the portion size, and tastes average at best. Will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Of course, within an airport, all the prices are inflated, especially this place. They don't even have water for you. At least when I asked for water, they handed me a cup. They said that the water is located outside in a water fountain. Who doesn't provide water at their restaurant? 

I had their chips and salsa as a snack. It was okay, but after getting the chips and salsa combo, I realized I paid for the salsa that I could have gotten free at their little salsa stand behind me. Oh well. I do not know whether they have multiple locations at McCarran, but the one I went to was located in Terminal B."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service, pretty rude staff. 
The meat had no flavor, only had pico de gallo. No real salsa or hot sauce. 
The presentation of the burrito bowl is pretty bad. 
The black beans were okay but no pinto beans offered."}
{"text":"Really bad experience. Do not plan to go back ever. They were out of my 1st two choices, and the burrito I finally got was terrible. Rice was dry, chicken had a lot of gristle. Lost a customer today."}
{"text":"Actually some reallllly great tacos for airport food! The chicken was nicely seasoned and juicy with plenty of lettuce and pico. Definitely get salsa and top it off, the salsa is zesty with a little spice - delicious!  The rice is a bit overdone but add salt and again, salsa."}
