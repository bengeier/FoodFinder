{"text":"Pretty average. It has spacious, but cozy interior. The waitress was not particularly nice. I ordered medium hot chocolate and a Swiss roll. Cake was super dry. Hot chocolate tasted as if it was made from instant-hot-chocolate. Overall the experience was OK"}
{"text":"I'd rate more 2.5 stars instead of 3 but I am generously rounding up
The prices have gone up from when most of these reviews were written and you won't be eating for less than $15 incl tax. 
The mains are ok. The salads are great and hard to choose which 2 to have.
Notice that in the reviews those who state the portions are large are women
I am a man and I am not full after I eat a meal here so I will say the value is not good when I evaluate portion, price and quality.
If you're not eating in and it's for lunch you're better off going to the hot table in the fruit market behind and eat for half the price."}
{"text":"I was feeling adventurous one work day and decided to try this restaurant in a Polish strip mall. Let it be known, Polish food is not in my typical realm of comfort cuisines. 

Looking noticeably lost as I wandered in, I approached the ordering counter and looked at the menu. The girl behind the counter looked somewhat annoyed and stared me down. There's no one behind me, don't worry, I think to myself. After finding it difficult to orient myself on the menu, I decided upon a more efficient way of ordering, which was to point at the food behind the counter, on display for customers to see, and ask what it was. I pointed at a couple of dishes, but the girl gave very curt answers, and essentially added little meaningful insight on the dishes. So I decided to vote with my eyes. I saw many items that looked delightful. Many were pork or schnitzel dishes it seemed; not that unlike what I believe German food to look like. I ended up choosing a pork shoulder dish, which looked phenomenally succulent. It also came with appetizing sides of mashed potatoes, cucumbers (with dill) and beets. They transported my plate over to the cashier part of the counter, where I was somewhat caught off guard when they rang me up for $12 + tax. For an order-at-the-counter casual bistro in Mississauga, I have to admit that seemed a little steep. 

The food was delicious, enough so that I have gone back 3-4 times. I even took a friend here, who thought highly of the food, but who was similarly confused by the curtness of the service. All in all, the food is pretty solid; I like the flavors a lot. But prices were quite high, and service remains an enigma to me. I tend to not very highly value service, and give restaurant staff the benefit of the doubt (whether it be for cultural misunderstandings, people simply having a bad day, etc), but here I have just been constantly confused."}
{"text":"Great little family run bistro! Traditional homemade Polish cuisine. You get Massive portions for cheap! Love the Goulash, Schnitzel or Beef stew! Delicious! You know its truly authentic when some of the employees don't speak English! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Arkady Bistro is located near the south east intersection of Burnhamthrope and Dixie in Mississauga just one light south of Burnhamthorpe.

Arkady is a cafeteria style place that serves mostly eastern European style dishes and also has dessert and coffee.  While there are specials daily such as pierogies, Hungarian pancake etc there are also mainstay dishes like pork ribs, schnitzel (pork and chicken), fish and so on.  Dinner plates are typically large servings with a wide variety of sides and salads to choose from.  

So far I've been twice so far and I've been able to try the chicken schnitzel as well as the fish and on Fridays they have pierogies as a main as well.  For sides while they have dumplings and potatoes they also have sauerkraut and other hot sides but on the right side of the counter they have a choice of colder sides and salads such as cole slaw, cucumbers and beet salad.

While there are some other reviewers here saying it's not made to order and that food is kept warm in heating trays, new food is brought out often and in the few times I've been they've having to bring out new trays from the back because they sell quickly.  The turn around on the food is quick when it sells quickly of course.  While I didn't want to wait 10 minutes for pork schnitzel to be made fresh, I had the option to wait.  My brother had ordered pierogies and he had to come back to the counter when they brought them out.  

Basically when it's dinner time on a Friday, the food is not sitting around for a long time.  Both the fish and chicken schnitzel I've had, the coating was crisp (freshly fried).  I like the choices of food at Arkady and even though it's cafeteria style the food is definitely fresh.  Between new trays being cycled out and the hot food being hot, the cool side is cool.  The salads/veggies are crispy/crunchy and the quality if good.  

Seating can be a challenge here.  The place can get pretty busy.  They don't really have tables for groups, maybe 4 max with a few doubles scattered.  There's a stand up ledge just outside where I've seen patrons drink coffee and smoke.  This place seems to also be a hang out as well as a place to grab a decent sized plate of food.

They only take debit or cash."}
{"text":"This is a cute little European cafe on the corner of Dixie and Burhamthorpe that's kind of hidden.  I had just come from Starsky, so I was craving some European food and had seen this place before.  

They have some real meals (schnitzel, pork hoc, roast beef, etc.) but the issue I have is that it is more or less served cafeteria style (i.e. pre-cooked, sitting in warmer) and that the prices are around restaurant pricing (ranges from $10-$12 with potatoes and two side salads).  

The cafe itself had a nice atmosphere, but I was a bit upset with the \"service\".  I asked about the schnitzel and the guy just said \"prices are listed on the board\", but the problem is that I had no idea what anything was.  So I was kind of confused.  Anywho, despite the pricing and the somewhat awkward service, I ventured on with a chicken schnitzel combo (potatos and two salads).  It wasn't bad, but very bland, so I had to add salt and pepper.  

Probably won't visit again, though it was busy and maybe if you like this type of food, could be worth it for you as they also have some nice looking desserts and coffee."}
{"text":"Went there couple weeks ago to inquire about catering services for 25 people. The food looked good and I was told that they can deliver the food on Saturday afternoon ($15 delivery) Finally I chose my $18 a person package and went to place an order today.    I got an unfriendly and unprofessional customer service.  The two girls working there give me two different explanation of the meat I wanted.  They did not know what they were talking about. And at the end one of the girls told me they do not deliver on Saturdays and she just turned around and walked away.  Very disappointed. I guess almost $500 order is not good enough for them.  Will never try use them again or recommend them to my friends."}
{"text":"I come here for authentic polish food to go. I rarely dine in, however, did so once. There's enough room to sit down, there's a nice drink and dessert option and the cutlery is nicely laid out. The food is delicious. The soup is delicious too. I would recommend tripe soup or tomato soup. For dinner options, I would choose one meat, one potato (go for the donut potatoes - they are the best), and 2 cold salads (would recommend cucumber salad and carrot salad). Overall, very tasty and very filling at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Just ok for me!  Like Bernie mentioned, food is on warming trays, so not freshly prepared.  And I also found the food a bit on the bland side.  Could've used a bit more salt/seasoning.

If you have a meat & potatoes type palate, then this is the place for you!  Nothing really awakened my taste buds.  Beet salad was probably the best thing on my plate.  At least you know it's relatively healthy, I guess?

Yes, the portions are pretty large and you don't really hafta tip, but I *think* Cafe Polonez (High Park) had similar prices, was made-to-order, and was tastier.

If it's your first time, you may be a bit overwhelmed as menu board is not very descriptive.  It just says \"Cabbage Rolls - $11\", but then you have to ask how many rolls it includes, are any sides, etc. etc.  Most full sized meals were ~$12-13 and you can get half servings for $7, but you cannot get half-sized soups which was a bit of a disappointment because I did want to try beef tripe...without paying $11, it did NOT come with any sides."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good place to have a quick lunch/dinner and real cooked food, this place is amazing.
Full plate is around $12 and you'll be served a mama's portion with good meat and sides.
Truly authentic tasty Polish food that tastes like in Poland."}
{"text":"Great Polish food! Good for a quick bite of authentic European flavour.

ATMOSPHERE: Casual, fast-food-style dining experience.

SERVICE: Over-the-counter service is quick. 

PRICE: Reasonable for large portions. A combo typically comes with 2 generous helping of 1 carb and 1 veggie/salad of your choice. 

FOOD: Schnitzels are very good. I've had both the fish, and pork - and liked both. They also have chicken. I also enjoy their stews, dumplings, and sauerkraut.

Borscht is amazing! But rumour has it that it's only available on Sundays? Regardless, if they've got it you need to have it! I never thought I'd like beets, but their borscht had me thinking.

They also have good coffee, and a selection of pastries."}
