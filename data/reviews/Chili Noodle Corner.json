{"text":"I order the Pad Thai and it was delicious. The location is very convenient to market square, right next to the McDonalds. It's very clean in there and the service is friendly. I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for great Thai food on their lunch break."}
{"text":"A solid place to stop in before class or after work. The service is fast and the food is good with decent sized servings. The location is really convenient also."}
{"text":"Solid tofu noodle soup, exactly what I needed on a cold night killing time before my bus was scheduled. The waitress was super nice as well. I think all the downtown business people clear out after 5 because from 6-6:30 I was the only one in there!"}
{"text":"Here is another recommended Thai noodle place in Pittsburgh, besides Noodlehead. There are many kinds of Thai noodle and rice dishes. My favorite ones are \"Yen Ta Fo\" and \"Toon\". The broth of \"Toon\" is similar to the beef soup at Noodlehead. They have the love boat noodle as well, but I haven't tried it yet. Besides Thai noodles, the restaurant also offers some Japanese noodle dishes. The price of noodles is around $10.5.   For appetizers, I recommend steamed dumpling and \"shrimp wrap noodle\". I would say that the taste of steamed dumpling here is almost the same as that in Thailand. And I really love \"shrimp wrap noodle\". It brought me back to the time when I was a little kid. I loved to have a deep fried hot dog wrapped with egg noodles."}
{"text":"I think this pales in comparison to Nicky's Thai Kitchen located a few blocks away on Penn Avenue.  The chicken pad thai was just ok, not great, not horrible. The portion size is smaller than Nicky's and the price is about the same.  I ordered 3 on the 1-5 spicy scale, and that was just about right for the heat, although maybe next time I'll order a 4.  The service at lunch was fine.  I ordered the $2.50 oolong tea, which was a single tea bag in a small white cup. No pot. No specialty loose tea. Oh, and you want another tea bag, that will be another $2.50. For a $0.10 tea bag.  For this type of food, I don't see any real compelling reason to come here.  And I'm rounding DOWN because of tea bag."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised. I split the steamed dumplings with a friend - tasty, but nothing made them especially stand out. The complimentary salad with ginger dressing and an eggroll was a nice touch and my Udon Noodle dish was delicious. For $8.50, I had a filling lunch, and enough left over to take home for dinner. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here twice.  The last time i ordered pad thai.  I will say no matter what spice level you say, it still comes out not that hot.  The food is pedestrian.  Nothing special.  It's not bad, and is quite edible.  The pad thai was a little bland for me.  It kind of just tasted like slightly fishy noodles.  I ordered the veggie pad thai and the second time the chicken pad thai.  Both tasted exactly the same.  I've had way worse.  I've also eaten way better.  Don't let the two stars fool you, I'd eat there again in a pinch and the staff is quite friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered Thai basil fry rice, the flavor was good, but the beef was kinda cold and didn't get my bubble tea until I ask for it. Over all experience was alright, very slow!!! Only one waiter and a waitress for the whole restaurant"}
{"text":"Today was my first time dining in the restaurant but second time having their food. I had pad Thai for takeout and was pretty decent. Today I had the noodle soup called Thoon - dark broth with chicken and rice noodles topped with cilantro and scallions. Lunch meals come with a small side salad and an egg roll, so that makes lunch filling and a pretty good deal. I was a bit disappointed with the size of the soup. It was small and shallow in comparison to the bowls of other Asian noodle soup establishments. Also felt that they skimped the amount of broth too. I was also expecting a much richer, deeper flavor in the broth.  Service is attentive and waitstaff is very pleasant. Will likely not have the soup again, but will definitely try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, only downfall is that dinner prices are significantly more expensive (compared to prices for the same dish during lunch hours)"}
{"text":"This place is extremely clean and my server was attentive. I ordered Pad Thai during lunch. They came out with a mini salad and mini wonton to start for free. The dressing was ok, but I loved the wonton! Pad Thai was spot on. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch on a weekday. There was no wait so we were seated right away. I got the udon and my friend got the soba. The food came with salad which was ok. It didn't take long for the food to come out but I was disappointed on the portions! We are both pretty petite but were hungry even after we were done with our meals. Their food was just OK. Nothing that is a must have but it wasn't too bad. Would I be craving it enough to come back? Maybe not. Would I come back based on the limited choices downtown?  Maybe some day"}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count. Their prices are more than fair and the food is absolutely tasty. I've explored the menu and it has something for everyone. Traditional Japanese and Thai dishes, as well as some unique selections. Everything tasted great. You won't be disappointed. Favorite dish is probably the Thoon Soup with glass noodles and pork... Comes with shitake mushrooms and green lettuce with spices, herbs  in dark broth. Topped with scallion and cilantro., 4/5 on spice. Yum! A+"}
{"text":"Pretty good standard Thai. I've gotten takeout from here twice - Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. You get a small egg roll and a salad with your $9 lunch special. My mind wasn't blown but I wasn't disappointed either and was definitely full. A good spot for lunch downtown if you want something more exciting than a sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a cold day to warm up with some hot soup. Fast friendly service and the Tom Yum Soup was really good!  The server asked how hot I would like it on a scale of 1 - 5 and I asked for a 3.  The spicyness was spot on!  Yummmmm The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the choice of music (and volume) that was playing.  It was a local pop radio station but not what I cared to listen to while trying to have a relaxing lunch.  Just my personal opinion. Over it was a great experience and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice little place for lunch.  It is a sit down restaurant, but noticed many that must have called ahead and ordered take-out. The meal was good, good price and a nice size.  A small salad came with the meal that had a ginger dressing and a mix of lettuce (not all head lettuce) and a small Egg Roll.  Had the Pad Thai that was good.    A good place for a lunch in downtown."}
