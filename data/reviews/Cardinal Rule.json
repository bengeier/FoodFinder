{"text":"I went here last week on Friday, and it was great. I wondered why it had taken me so long to actually go in (well I know why, the outside doesn't look nearly as inviting as the inside does). Menu is colour coded and vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or non-veg friendly. There is probably something for everyone here which makes it a good potential spot to take non-veg in-laws or something. 

Service was great, our server seemed to actually like it there, and was knowledgeable about the menu.

I had the phish and chips and would totally eat them again, pretty delicious. Crispy deepfried pieces of tender tofu, with a side of chips and spicy house made tartar sauce.

I think it's time to check them out for a Sunday brunch and see what it looks like on a busy day."}
{"text":"Tried the benedict with tofu bacon replacement. Was tasty -and I am picky about benedicts-.  Potatoe latkes were good. The caramel/pretzel was tasty as well.

The mango cold rolls were good. Meat muffins were not and a bit messy to eat.

Nice decor. Loved the service. They tend to try new things or change some items in certain dishes from time to time which is refreshing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a most fantastic Eggs Benedict today at Cardinal Rule. Today was my first visit to this delightful diner, but it certainly won't be my last. I'm somewhat of an eggs benny connoisseur and can honestly say that this was the best I've had in the city. 

The english muffin was toasted just the way I like it, and the eggs were poached to the perfect consistency. Don't even get me started on the hollandaise! To die for. I really enjoyed the potato latkes that were served on the side as well, they were an excellent hollandaise-delivery vehicle for the extra sauce on the plate. The waitress was super friendly and personable, we could have sat there chatting with her all afternoon long if time had permitted! 

This place opened up a couple of years ago, and I had heard great things about it....they say \"all good things to those who wait\", and in this case, the 'good' was GREAT! We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Love beets, so I pretty much had to have the beet salad [small: $9] and thought, 
'oh that won't be enough' so I ordered fresh fruit as well [$5].
Whoa !  The portions were really generous.  Impressive. 

The beets were warm - nice big chunks of roasted sweet beetiness on top of mixed greens, pecans and feta mixed with a lovely tangy light dressing.  

The fruit was presented in a tall parfait glass filled with berries: blue, black and straw, as well as some grapes. Very pretty, very yummy.

When I'd polished off the beets I tossed some of that fruit onto the salad greens; it made a great combo with the rest of the nuts and feta and lemony dressing.  I would do that again.

My companion had the grilled cheese sandwich with a side of greens [$10] plus smoked ketchup [$1] and a tall glass of cider [$8]; all really good.

We were there for midweek lunch, and even though I'm vegetarian and need my food to be gluten-free, I had so much to choose from.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting this place is near me and when I go I always say, I gotta come back soon! The food is very good with decent portions, the last time we were here we ordered: 

Maki n Cheese- for someone who isn't a fan of mac'n cheese I was very impressed! The flavour was outstanding and it wasn't overloaded with cheese and the panko breading definitely kicks it up to a whole other level! 

Nachos with pulled chicken- this was so yummy! Lots of great pieces of chicken and again, the flavour profile behind the nachos was certainly on point. 

Potato Latkes - I saved this for last because these guys do it WELL!! Man, the amount of flavour in these badboy's is outrageous and being in the heart of little Roncy with many eastern European folks - they are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu for carnivores and vegans. Yum. quinoa pancakes. The texture was perfect. The brandy bananas as topping were an excellent alternative to syrup. The potato latkes are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The traditional breakfast is also incredible. Gluten allergy? Not a problem. They also have many gluten free meals. 
Great price and value. Portions are large but not overwhelming. Excellent service and atmosphere.  I think I've become a regular."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! Great service, great food, great location.

As someone with a gluten & dairy allergy, I was not only able to find a delicious brunch item to order, but I had my pick of several. My regular-food-eating friend was just as excited by the creative menu as I was. 
We had the Quinoa Coconut Pancakes - which were delicious - and the Tofu Bacon (awesome), and the Huevos Quesadillas which also rocked. 

The staff are funky, fun & fast, the portions are generous & the vibe laid back/casual. Perfect for mixed company of food allergies AND regular brunchers. Nearby antique shops on Queen St & Roncesvalles make for a great weekend stroll to work it off after :)"}
{"text":"20 minutes after ordering, our waitress came and asked us what our order was. She apologized and said it would be up next. After watching 3 other tables get their food, 20 minutes later we had our food. The yolks in the eggs benedict were not even warm, and not at all cooked. Only about 20% of the egg white was left, and the cold yolks exploded onto everything making it inedible. The waitress noticed that it wasn't eaten and comp'd our coffees, which we had waited way too long to be refilled."}
{"text":"The Cardinal Rule is our go-to brunch and dinner spot, now that I'm vegan. It's fantastic. There are so many vegan & gluten free options, of which they let you swap with little additional cost.

After over a year in the Roncy area, I wish that we found this place sooner. I would feel comfortable bringing friends/family from all walks of life there. The servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant in Parkdale! Great service. Comprehensive menu with options for carnivores, veg's, vegans and gluten sensitive diners. I highly recommend the mini meatloaf apps. Beyond amazing! Great atmosphere, good music and fun people make this new place sure to be the next hot spot!  Love Love Love!"}
{"text":"Nice place and decent food. Was a little over-priced for what you get in terms of quantity."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. A lot of options for Vegetarians and gluten free options. Friendly staff too:)"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday and had very high hopes. I was severely disappointed by the dirty bathroom and dining area. Concept great but doesn't work in practice."}
{"text":"I'm coming out of my Yelp-review-writing retirement to lavish praise on this fine establishment.

Food was great, blah blah blah, but here's what's prompting this: on a recent family trip to Toronto, we had promised our 3.5 year old a milkshake. Nowhere nearby had milkshakes. The shitty McDonald's across the street did not have milkshakes that day (broken machine, I presume). Easy was rude and dismissive when we asked. 

We needed food and talked our son into getting a milkshake later, but he was clearly bummed and there was a better than good chance a meltdown would happen any minute.

So do you know what the ladies working that day did? WENT TO THE GODDAMN CORNER STORE, BOUGHT ICE CREAM, AND MADE OUR SON AN AMAZING MILKSHAKE!

Seriously, that is ridiculously awesome, nice, and greatly appreciated. Way above and beyond.

Bravo, ladies of Cardinal Rule working that Monday lunch shift, bravo."}
{"text":"The food here is creative, cooked with great care and tastes fantastic! We had the very delicious brussel sprout & bacon slaw (wow!), cold mango-veg roll, moist beautifully seasoned brisket sammy, divine meat volcano - which is a glorious mound of latkes (the BEST this latke-lover has ever had!), roasted veg, spinach, pearl onions and meat muffins with veg crisps. The chocolate pretzel pie is on it's way. Can't wait! (They have vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options)"}
{"text":"Why are two of my favourite spots in the city named Cardinal? Hmm I dunno - maybe this is a sign that my firstborn will also be named Cardinal... We'll see. 

Cardinal Rule is tops! Marta in the kitchen is a whiz and her creative mind makes some of the best meals around. I have had the Maki and Cheese Rolls, the Pulled Pork Brisket, the burger and several hung over breakfasts that made me feel like a champ. 

My favourite though? The brussel sprout and bacon side salad that comes with the Pulled Pork. Seriously - who would of thought brussel sprouts could be cool? THESE GUYS, that's who!

The food is always piping hot when it gets to the table, great service, always on the water refills, cutlery, and the best part? Our large group all had single bills and the tax was included! Round number, no figuring stuff out, just pay, tip and go. SAWEET

Oh, and $5 for 2 PBR - you can't go wrong with that.

Thanks for another great Cardinal-named business!"}
{"text":"Marta and Katie know what they are doing, good food, eclectic style and great bevies!  More restaurants need to put the love into their establishments, these trail blazing ladies make it look so easy!  Well done ladies"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst dining experiences in my entire life. The food is definitely overrated, the seating awkward (by the wall makes you feel like a giant as it's so high compared to the chair across from you) and the WORST part is the service. 

We had a mouthy blonde the Saturday afternoon we went by. Clearly she was not trained for this job. She starts spouting off the \"specials\" without asking us whether we were interested in a non vegan or vegan brunch. When she finally took a breath (or forgot what she was saying), I asked her a question about drinks. She responded irritably then very rudely asked if we wanted her to continue with the specials \"or not\"....almost as if this was a play & we interrupted her acting. I asked if any of the specials were vegan, she said they were not and looked more annoyed...then looked at my partner and asked if he were vegan too...he nodded. She walked away.

My handbag was kept next to me and she soon walked by saying \"honey could you move your bag please, thanks\" when some other customers walked in.

Needless to say we will NEVER be returning to this place again nor recommending it to anyone. Usually a small place like this would have great servers who know how to interact well with customers and keep them coming back. The owners must not care about this if they hired such a ditz. As a fellow business owner, my first concern would be staff and their treatment of my customers....this is clearly not a concern here.

Food was tolerable but nothing to write home about and be prepared for an extra charge for a small serving of maple syrup with your brunch...which I would imagine would be standard with things like pancakes or french toast. Bizarre and not an experience I could recommend. Much nicer vegan brunch options out there. Forget this dump."}
{"text":"This place is so great; I go here fairly regularly for brunch (I've never been for anything else, actually) and it's just such a fun, relaxed spot.

The food is good but not spectacular, but they have an absurd amount of vegetarian and vegan options. Mostly I love the atmosphere - the servers are all extremely friendly, the customers come from all walks of life, and everyone always seems to be in such a good mood. Almost every time I'm there I end up having a nice little conversation with someone from a neighbouring table.

If I'm looking for a more formal, specialized brunch experience I'll typically go elsewhere. But this is my go-to place for those lazy weekend mornings when I just want to pop out and have a nice, casual breakfast in a laid-back and friendly environment."}
{"text":"i moved to this neighbourhood a few months ago, and regret not spending more time at cardinal rule before!
the service has been consistently friendly and quick, even when it's busy. my boyfriend and i are vegan and trying to work our way through the menu - no disappointments yet. my parents have come with us too, and both of them loved their meatier options. 
my favourites so far have been the shared vegan breakfast, and the burrito (made gluten free, into tacos)."}
{"text":"admittedly, i've been here once. and was inspired to go by all the great reviews i'd read. but this is what happened to us:  we went around noon this past saturday. our server informed us they are on a limited brunch menu because of basement renos. i guess the kitchen is normally in the basement?  we both ordered the Huevos Cardinales Quesadilla. 20 mins went by. 30 minutes. 3 tables around us that had arrived 15 mins after we did got their food. nobody came by to ask if we needed anything. drinks, anything. nobody came by. and it's not a large place. we were conspicuously sitting there with an empty table. for FORTY MINUTES. i finally had to flag down a girl who was not our original server as she walked by and asked if she knew when our food would be out. she went to check with our waitress who i saw looking blankly over at us. she then (new girl) came over and apologized and said she would comp our meal if we still wanted it. i asked how long it would be since we had to go to a wedding that aft. she said asap. so fine. 

new girl was great. our server was ridiculous. but here's my real problem: the quesadilla is DISGUSTING. it's described like this: Scrambled eggs with old cheddar, black beans, roasted corn and chipotle baked into a flour tortilla. sounds good right? 

here's what it actually IS: flour tortilla, check. stale, btw. eggs, yeah they are there. old cheddar, i guess. maybe a half ounce, in 3 quesadillas. black beans? there were 5. FIVE. in the whole order. roasted corn? nope. chipotle? definitely not. there wasn't even SALT in it. it was the blandest thing i had ever eaten. just scrambled eggs folded in a tortilla. seriously i have no idea how that gets sent out of a kitchen. i could make better at home in 5 seconds for 99 cents. if i had had to PAY for that meal, i mean...i guess i would have been extra pissed?

so anyway....that's what happened. it was gross. and our original server never once came over to apologize or anything, she left it to the other girl. bizarre experience."}
{"text":"In this unsuspecting little joint at the foot of Roncesvalles at Queen I shared 3 plates on a first date: Maki and Cheese, Curried Apple and Goat Cheese Salad and Pork Quesadillas. The food isn't complicated and I think that's the beauty. Quick, easy and delicious. And a pretty great spot for people watching.

I would recommend trying the Maki and Cheese - a creative fusion of the classic mac'n'cheese, rolled and fried into a maki-roll presentation.

Also, try the house drink. It was so good that I drank three and forgot the name...."}
{"text":"I haven't been in over 18 months, but when I went it tasted like everything was frozen and then flash fried and drizzled with some sauce to make it somehow acceptable."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 that went for dinner. Very small dining area, but being that it's winter we had the place basically to ourselves. The service was amazing - the server knew her stuff and they were very accommodating to our various food restrictions and allergies (celiac, vegetarian, vegan, soy allergy). The food came relatively quickly, and it was AMAZING. Everybody was extremely satisfied with their meals. Special recommendations for the deep fried pickles, which are delicious and gluten-free, and for the Mac and cheese which is also available in vegan and gluten-free options. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 10:00 pm on a Saturday night, not knowing anything about this place. We had the gluten free squash and chicken quesadillas, particularly awesome since my wife has celiac disease. Turns out they have a lot of gluten free options, and kitchen staff that are experienced in dealing with celiac issues. Ten thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Let's see....small portion size,wildly overpriced, \"veggie facon\" that is literally store bought soft tofu lightly seasoned, bad service and a $12 mimosa special that they really should tell customers costs that much.  The only credit goes to the cook who made a pretty good pancake.  But that said,  I won't go again and I'll actively tell other people to avoid this place."}
{"text":"A pretty average brunch is to be had at Cardinal Rule. Nothing terrible, nothing i'd go back for.  Eggs florentine comes with raw spinach, though the eggs were perfectly cooked. Breakfast quesadilla is huge and bland. Coffee refills are slow.  Next time, i'll walk across the street to Easy."}
{"text":"This is a small diner serving very interesting food.  We had good portions for a very good price.

Maki N Cheese (very interesting)
Meat muffins
Granny' s apple salad (it was ok)
Lamb soup ( very nice)

Po boy Shrimp tacos
Tagliatelle with shrimps
Brisket burger
Pouting
Hamburger
Quesadilla

Total incl tax and tip -$150.00

We had a really good meal. Nice atmosphere.  Waiter was very friendly. We did have to try hard to get his attention when we had a question.

We'd got back for more"}
{"text":"Arrived just before 10 am for Sunday brunch.  We were the first ones there, but it rapidly got very busy and the placed filled up.  Dining with a veggie a vegan and a meat eater makes eating out somewhat challenging. This restaurant was a perfect place because everyone could order what we wanted.  The owner was really nice and it was an easy going place.  Would recommend as a great brunch place."}
{"text":"Simple. Tasty comfort food with a fuck off menu. Like this place. Go."}
{"text":"This place was great. Went in for a quick bite to eat and got the brisket panini which I will worn you is very filling. Even though I left there with itis I will be going back there when I am the neighbour again."}
{"text":"It is the people here that really sets this place apart! Service here is always cheerful and friendly; they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable here. It's an affordable, casual place when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We have been eating here once in a while since we live in the area. Today we tried to go there for supper and when we entered my daughter was crying because she didn't want to leave her stroller. As I was beginning to calm her down showing her photos on my phone, the waitress (Misa) approached our table and asked us to calm down our daughter since she was disturbing other customers. 
This is extremely rude. We had just begun to sit down  and if you care about customer service you tell the customer something along the lines \"is there anything I can do to help your daughter smile? Water? Straw?\" 
We eat out quite often and never had trouble in any restaurant in Toronto, whether my daughter was having a good or bad day.
The waitress was very insensitive and I will now become very vocal and share with all my network all about my horrible experience at this restaurant.
Children are part of society and sometimes they cry. Parents will always do our best to mediate the situation as fast as possible in public places but kids are not robots."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while and when I finally made it in, I was a bit disappointed. The whole place smells a bit damp. While they are making a good effort on the menu, it was mediocre upon arrival. The chicken club was ok but the daily soup (potato bacon cheddar) was unbearably over-salted.

Service was great but the box of band aids on the kitchen counter, bar glasses drying on towels and the aforementioned smell of damp were difficult to overlook. 

Don't think I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"I was stuck for a place to take a visiting vegan friend out for dinner and was thrilled to discover that this restaurant was in my hood and had a tonne of animal free options. I figured any place with a dozen vegan dinner items and a whole separate 'vegan brunch' menu would know what's up. Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious but the sour cream substitute that came with my squash quesadilla was a little too good. When I asked the server what it was, she said it was actual sour cream and that it 'comes with all the quesadillas.' I politely pointed out that we used the word 'vegan' about three times in when we ordered and said that I'm not vegan but what if I was? She just smirked and said \"then I guess the world would end.\" and walked away. Wow. Thanks."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. My boyfriend brought me where after a recommendation from a friend, while it took us about half an hr to get here, the food was definately worth it. When I walked in I was like really?? This place is going to serve me good food? The place is super divvy (from my perspective), it seemed really dark however the picture on here shows it super bright. We came in here the evening before a long weekend so maybe they were just winding down. The neighbourhood around the corner makes me slightly nervous as well. 
I ordered the maki-n-cheese rolls and I didnt find then dry at all, they have a sliver of jalepeno down the centre which was great. The smoked ketchup was also amazing. My boyfriend ordere the quesadilla which he inhaleddddd. I'd say he liked it. 
The bill was pretty cheap I'd say about 20 bucks, but there are some things to mention - cash only (make sure you bring some with you because when we went the ATM was out of cash), they have no \"brand name\" pop (she stated it was too much money) and it was flat in my opnion, thirdly they charge you a dollar extra for side sauces i.e. sour cream cost us an extra $1. 
Overall the waitresses were nice and the food was good - I crave those mac and cheese rolls every now and again, but since it's not close by I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend's parents who were in from out of town.  We were looking for something light and vegetabley because we did Korean BBQ for lunch.  Remembering the a la carte style of ordering from glancing at the menu as we went by in the past,  we chose Cardinal Rule.  Oh boy am I glad!  Our group tried the: Potato and leek latkes,  squish squash quesadilla,  beef brisket panini,  mango cold rolls and a salad with goat cheese,  apples and candied pecans.  Everything was so good.  I am not a food aficionado,  but everything seemed fresh,  the ingredients were high quality,  and the flavours were intense.  Additionally,  the server (owner? I am not sure) was fantastic.  Very helpful,  attentive without being in our faces and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I will absolutely be back to Cardinal Rule,  and I'll be telling as many people as I can to do the same."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! And reasonably priced! 

I had a eggs Benedict with eggs that were boiled in clamato juice. It was served on an English muffin with Genoa salami and pico de galo. AND with two potato/leek latkes. AND it was $12 taxes in. 

Can't wait to try dinner."}
{"text":"I drank the Dill Caesar and ate the Cowboy Eggs Benedict.

Dill Caesar (5/5): a good Caesar should punch you in the face with flavour and, like a good punch, leave a lasting impression.  This Dill Caesar is one of the best Caesars I've tried. If you have ever mixed dill pickle and ketchup chips, or if you have ever had dill pickle ketchup, you can already guess how well Clamato and dill go together: the answer is very. A perfect amount of spice, topped with a fantastic deep-fried pickle (thin, crisp batter covering a juicy pickle). Flavourful and not too salty. Well done!

Cowboy Benny (4/5): the eggs were cooked just right over a healthy portion of beef brisket. The brisket was tender, if not melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sweetness of the buttermilk biscuits (instead of English muffin) was a nice compliment to the brisket.  Came with two potato latkes on the side - these were excellent, crispy at the edges and soft in the middle with a nice balance of onion and potato flavour - a welcome twist on traditional breakfast potatoes: nothing fancy, just good latkes.

Ambiance (3/5): small, clean room with friendly staff who were knowledgeable about the food. The ambiance met expectations. The washrooms were not dirty though not clean like a good hotel washroom either.

Bottom line: I would come here and again and recommend to friends living within a 20 minute walk radius. Try the Dill Caesar!"}
{"text":"So you have dietary restrictions, not a problem at Cardinal Rule. They offer options for vegans, vegetarians and Celiacs. The menu has a great variety of foods that tease your palette. Do avoid the coffee, it is quite burnt but don't skip dessert, it's scrumptious."}
{"text":"I had \"phish & chips\" which is panko battered tofu with fries and my friend had an order of poutine and the \"maki cheese rolls\" which is kraft dinner looking noodles with cheese and mashed cauliflower filling.

Presentation is nice but I thought everything was a bit salty. 
When we went the server was prompt and he advised us the maki cheese rolls would take a bit longer than the other items ordered.

This is a greasy diner trying to be hip putting a creative spin on tried and true comfort foods.

I would give this place 2 and half stars - can't say I've experienced better since I don't typically order these items when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"I'm glad this bar is closing. The food is mediocre and the trivia host makes me want to drill out my ears."}
{"text":"I still love this place!

Also, seeing as my previous review was all about the Phish & Chips, I figured I should mention that they've changed the batter. Still delicious, but now with more spices. YUM!"}
{"text":"This diner is very small but welcoming. The menu has a lot of options for vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. Also options for gluten free beer! The restaurant has fun events posted, like trivia nights. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Exceptional brunch and great service! I ordered a \"build a benny\" and it was really good. Looking forward to the French Toast."}
{"text":"This place was definitely a winner in my book.  Went there with 3 others, 2 omnivores and my wife and I (vegans) for Sunday brunch at around 11am.  The crowd was decent, found a table right away and got down to business!
First of all, I liked the atmosphere, I was definitely feeling the diner experience, even for the slightly snobbish air that brunch usually garners.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.
Now for the food.  This was a particular delight.  As vegans, we usually get two choices in an omnivorous establishment: a wrap of some kind and maybe a stir fry.  Cardinal Rule had definite options, and clearly marked, to where we actually had to think and read the menu!  Our omnivorous friends had plenty of choice (they getting the quesadilla and the quiche).  The quesadilla was a monster!  Like a Godzilla Quesadilla!  It was an impressive site, and he liked it to boot.  The quiche looked good, got good reviews but nothing too amazing.  I had the Vegan classic breakfast and that was high quality.  The size was good, baked beans were very good (I was expecting straight out of a can, and if they were, it was a good can) and food well prepared.  The eggs could have been a little better, little more flavor, but really didnt detract from the experience.  Food came out in time and warm (not always a given at vegan establishments).
The price was very reasonable too.  All in all, I was happy with the experience for meat-eater and vegan alike, and would recommend it to other 'mixed' couples."}
{"text":"Upon entering the Cardinal Rule, my friend and I were greeted by a very lovely and friendly gal who seated us and also served us. We were the only customers so we didn't have to wait and of course we didn't feel rushed to order, which gave me time to check out the scene. The decor is unique with funky tables sandwiched between comfy booth seats. 

After a quick breeze through the menu, I set my heart on the \"Squish Squash Quesadilla.\" Funky name for a treat that's filled with marinated tofu, squash, goat cheese and candied pecans. Unfortunately, I found it a bit dry and lacking flavor, so it did fail to dazzle me. On the bright side, my friend ordered the veggie burger, which I managed to get a bite of and it was admittedly pretty darn tasty.

A lot of their options are vegan, vegetarian and also gluten free, so there seems to be a selection for all foodie types. I'd like to go back and try the brunch, which I hear is pretty stellar. I never give up after the first try, and perhaps the Cardinal will one day Rule my heart. Only time will tell..."}
{"text":"i've given this place a shot a couple of times -last summer it was ok
last time i was there it was just plain bad and i realized it is way overpriced"}
{"text":"Lovely breakfast and very attentive waitstaff. Our waitress was very fun and sweet. My build your own benedict was delicious and we enjoyed a round of coffee, tea and mimosas. 

There is an even selection of veggie, vegan, and meat-y options so whatever your persuasion you should be satisfied."}
{"text":"One word: friendly! Vegetarian/Vegan/gluten-free/meat-lover/kid/wallet friendly - a place where any eclectic group can all go and be happy. We have eaten here 10 times and love it. Not everything is fantastic, but it's all good to great. Reasonable portions and reasonably priced. Fun stuff going on like trivia nights and other interesting entertainment if you have time to stick around or want to hang out with friends but not at crappy bar."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in here, and the rotating art. The fact they have vegan and veggie options is a plus, the fact that it's all delecious is even better. So glad I love only a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  Cute, cozy & relaxed, this is a great place for meat eaters and vegans to dine together in perfect harmony.  My second time there, we happened to arrive just as Wednesday Trivia Night was starting, and although we didn't get a single answer right (it was a Parks & Rec theme), it was very entertaining and the trivia host was a total character. 

Food:  All vegan and gluten free options on the menu are clearly noted, and there are several to choose from, including a gluten free beer.  I've had both the phish & chips and the fried buffalo tofu sandwich with garlic aioli (both vegan & gf) and I enjoyed them both...the sammie was my fav and I'll be going back for more very soon. Mmmmmm.....that gf bun slayed me. 

Service:  always friendly, prompt, and they know the menu inside & out

Value:  As mentioned by other reviewers, the prices for the sandwiches are a little high considering that they don't come with anything, but for someone with so many dietary restrictions, it's worth it just to be able to eat with friends like a normal human being. 

Since it's right at the bottom of Roncesvalles, it's the perfect spot to start the afternoon with lunch, then spend the rest of the day wandering around the neighbourhoods checking out all the vintage/antique shops, cafes and various quirky Roncie/Queen West stuff."}
{"text":"last time I trust John Cattucci! you don't gotta eat here! overpriced  quiche, with baby greens ala cosco, 15$ burger w day or two old bun and eggs Benedict you don't gotta go here for,  walk a few blocks north and go to la cubana."}
{"text":"If you feel like paying $10.00 for \"one\"(1) pancake be my guest. Yes it was made of quinoa but so what! Even my wife who is more of a foodie than myself thought  this was a bad deal. The pancake looked so lonely and sad when it arrived.

So as my review on yelp will be a warning to other vegans in the Parkdale/Roncesvalles area. 

If your looking for a restaurant that thinks all vegans eat like birds, that restaurant would be Cardinal Rule. 

Please go, but  don't bring your appetite."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go on a whim in this city.

Tons of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options that are never disappointing.  

Highly recommend this place for a tasty lunch OR dinner and also for their super cute decor."}
{"text":"Please note, that this is my first review on Yelp because I don't typically write reviews but this place is worth writing one for. 
With that being said, I went to Cardinal Rule this afternoon with my boyfriend with the intention of getting a late breakfast. 
I'm vegan and my boyfriend is not, so I was pleased with their options for both him and I and we both left feeling more than satisfied. 
The space is very cozy and welcoming, and the service was great. 
I find it extremely difficult to find a variety of vegan options in the city for breakfast let alone a place that offers both; Cardinal Rule made it super easy to decide what to get from their menu! 
I had the classic breakfast with (delicious) baked beans, it was flavourful and exactly what I was craving, the latkes are made to perfection. My boyfriend on the other hand had the classic breakfast with sausage and bacon, and personally I think it's very difficult to mess that up so he was happy with his choice. 
The service we received was amazing, our server was prompt and extremely attentive. 
I would definitely recommend checking them out, five stars and no regrets :)"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout, the Burger de Boeuf was okay, I didn't realize I had to ask for the basics which weren't included; ketchup, mustard, or mayo maybe? If I'm not asked to add them then I assume its in there, so it tasted a tad dry but if you're craving a burger it hits the spot.
Also ordered the baked mac n cheese - totally worth it, yummy! but for the price you pay, it was a small portion.
The Cardinal Sin Fries were the only disappointment, terrible, just awful, why is this on the menu and who likes them? Is it popular? If not this dish needs an overhaul. If I order fries that advertise to be cheesy fries, then I expect cheese on my fries.. but no, it was fries with a bechamel white sauce, runny, no cheese flavor whatsoever, shocking, I think they forgot to add cheese in the sauce, it was bland and ruined all my fries, unedible, tasteless, total let down. I'd suggest ditching that white runny sauce & actually make a cheese sauce to.put on the fries, like the sauce you use on your mac n cheese - there's an idea! cheese fries should have cheese and a cheesy taste.  Overall, 2 out of 3 dishes is good, I'd definitely try other dishes they offer."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I am not vegan nor vegetarian but I keep an open mind and I love the quinoa pancakes!!! I am dying to try the maki n' cheese but I've only been there for brunch so far!  I will be back and I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Recently had a private party held here for my birthday and couldn't have asked for a better spot. Perfect for 30-40 people, cozy, great beer on tap, and their menu is so diverse, flexible and tasty that everyone was talking about the food. Katie is super chill and awesome. Loved it."}
{"text":"Nice people, good options, okay food. 

I want to like it more because the menu has great options (already covered in other reviews), they are making what could be a dark little place as cheery as possible and the whole experience radiates comfort. But I always leave feeling kind of underwhelmed. Then I forget and wonder why I'm not going there more often, I drop in and it all happens again.

It's a safe, affordable, palatable choice at a place where there isn't much of that for a few blocks. For me, not a destination but an ok place to wander in."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic and simple brunch there.  Got there around 3:30 pm, so late for eating, and there were only two other tables seated in the restaurant.  Service was friendly and fast.  Good alcohol selection, I had a pear cider, but my dining companion had the Dill Caesar (with a deep fried pickle on top!) and it was goooood.  

To eat, I had the grilled cheese - straightforward.  Just a sandwich on a plate, but I was thankful for that, as I didn't want anything else.  I had a side of the smoked ketchup - usually I'm just a regular ol' Heinz kind of girl, but this stuff was really good.  Price for my meal (not including cider): $8.  

Almost everything on the menu can be made gluten-free AND/OR vegetarian, so bring anyone along with you!  I'd say \"we'll be back!\" but it took us 2 1/2 hours to walk there....so....\"we'll be back -- by TTC!\""}
{"text":"Casual funky resto. Sign is not visible, but it's the last block before Queen.. and a short walk over the Gardiner to Palace Pier and the water.
Gods was very good. Sweet potato fries and cold rolls in particular were excellent. Best service from Christine who was funny charming and attentive. Really good options for vegan and gluten free too."}
{"text":"Dear Cardinal Rule-
Thank you for being everything we want in a favourite neighbourhood spot!
The food is always ample, comforting, and delicious. We've enjoyed the personable service and feeling welcomed as friends. The owners are top-notch businesswomen and we love to support local entrepreneurs!
We've been coming for years - and enjoyed hosting a private event in this space (an incredible experience we'd highly recommend for intimate parties). We continue to revel in just how good the food is. 
The macaroni maki have us coming back every time, but chef Marta can elevate even fish and chips. Seriously - you need to try the basa fish and chips; the most delicate texture and flavour while staying comfort-food satisfying. I never would have thought fish and chips would be review-worthy, but we definitely recommend. We also always enjoy the rotating hearty salads. 
Brunch is it's own special treat - one of the chef's specials is always a winning bet, and we can't leave without the Hawaiian French toast (we recommended for every couple who can't decide between savoury or sweet). 
Although we don't drink, the cocktail list and taps have always pleased our friends. 
Thank you for being such a neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to the zoo yesterday, so the boys and I needed a hearty breakfast first.

We ordered the Eggs Benedict for my husband, the Fruit Bowl for the kid and I had their breakfast burger (the actual name escapes me and I can't find it on their online menu).

The Eggs Benedict were served on an english muffin with peameal bacon and hollandaise sauce. They came with potato latkes.
My husband loved the poached eggs, but was not a fan of the potato latkes nor the sauce. 

The Fruit Bowl was somewhat disappointing.
It contained 50% pineapple, 40% cantaloupe, 10% strawberries.
Our son doesn't even like pineapple and quite frankly I think that there should be more variety in a fruit bowl to begin with.
I also need to mention that this was just our second choice to begin with. We wanted to order a side of breakfast sausages for the kid, but were told that they were out - since the day before.. 

My burger came on a kaiser bun with tomato, bacon, potato latke and an egg. 
It was a nicely sized meat patty and obviously made fresh.
I really liked the burger. 
The egg, the potato latke and the meat went well together and created a good flavor.

We also had a coffee each, but those were nothing to write home about.

The service a great.
Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. 
She made sure to get our son a coloring book and crayons first before giving us the menus.

The prices were pretty decent.
Our bill incl. tax was $28."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to the Cardinal Rule with my cousin. I don't typically frequent the Parkdale area, however I had found a deal for this restaurant on the website TeamBuy.ca (spend $12 get $30), and who am I to pass up a good deal? ;-)

I had checked the ratings on Yelp prior to signing up for the deal, and noted that they were sort of all over the map. I decided that it was best in this case to come to my own conclusions.

As I didn't come for weekend brunch, I can't comment on whether or not the prior reviews from Lauren M or Justice D were accurate.  What I can say is that the service was excellent (that could be due to the fact that there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, so the manager could devote her attention to us), and that the food was delivered rather promptly (we were in and out in little more than an hour).

While the menu isn't huge, it does have some eclectic concoctions, some of which have already been mentioned by prior reviewers.  As I don't eat pork, and am not down with goat cheese, it limited my choices somewhat. I chose to go with the vegan quesadilla's ($8) (it had a base of curried squash with spinach and tofu) with the side of greens ($3). The quesadilla's were tasty, however they only provided a portion of 3 wedges, which seemed rather small. I could have used one more slice. Further, the contents seemed rather paltry. The greens were tossed in a vinaigrette, however, $3 seemed pricey given the fact that it was just lettuce. I would have chosen the sweet potato fries, however that was ($6) and seemed a bit much for a side portion.

My cousin chose the brisket panini and the potato latkes. He was very impressed with the meal on the whole. I had a bite of the latkes and can confirm that they were very good.

There is no set dessert menu. They had three items available. I chose the caramel/pretzel pastry square ($3.50). It was ok, however it was a bit too salty for my taste. 

Conclusion: Given that I had a deal for this meal, I would say that I was satisfied, as I prefer to put into context the cost of the meal versus the quality of the meal. I would probably return one more time to try out a few other items on the menu, however, given the vast selection of restaurants to try in the city, and given the fact that I do not live right around the corner from the restaurant, it's not likely that I will be returning to the Cardinal Rule so quickly."}
{"text":"Very good and imaginative food, but if a good meal means that it had good service, this isn't the place for you. 

We came here for brunch, and saw that there was one server for the whole place, which was packed for Sunday brunch. Yeah, you can see where this is going ... The food was excellent - their latkes in particular were delicious, but it took a while to be served. That said, if you like watching your server attending to other tables and take their orders, even though they came after you, come here! Your dream come true."}
{"text":"Great laid back ambiance. My server was very sweet and accommodating. Chef there that night made very slavery poutine and potato latkes."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere. With vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options there are choices for everyone. 

Service was a little on the slow side. But the staff are quite personable and the delicious food more than makes up for it. 

Meal: Wallop burger is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'd put this place pretty perfectly at 4 starts. I liked it, and I'd go back.

ordered: brisket sandwich, pountine, some sort of vegetarian volcano dish that was a variation on meatloaf. Drinks were coffee & beer. Total bill before tip hovered around 40$:.

the good stuff

1) I really really love that the menu is clearly marked for veg, vegan, gluten-free etc. and that there are many options of each. As my husband and frequent dining partner is a picky vegetarian, this a was a relief. One thing to note is that all prices listed include tax, good to factor in when ordering.

2) The food was all very good, but the clear winner were the fries. Spectacular, soft inside, crisp outside. The gravy was veg so hubby could eat and also very tasty. 

3) server was a super chill dude, on top of it but not in our face. Lots of coffee refills and water refills. 

4) fantastic beer special. 2 Pabst Blue Ribbon for 5$

room for improvement:

The decore is fine but nothing special. Two booths up front and then banquettes along either side and a two-seat spot in the back. Tables are low and less comfortable for tall people, but probably fine for people who are not amazons like us. Not so much to my specific taste, but I can totally see other people digging the laid back style. Decore likely matters to me more than it should."}
{"text":"Nice friendly small place. Vegan options. Maccheesemaki is must try. Interesting texture."}
{"text":"This is my second attempt at a review, my first, less detailed one got eaten up, so hopefully this will be a welcome improvement!

As a regular visitor to the corner of Queen and Roncy, (same as everybody else who needs to make that never-ending 504 bus connection) I kept passing by Cardinal Rule really late at night, lamenting how much I wanted to try the Maki n' Cheese Rolls and some other noshy delights on the menu. 

After two run ins on late evenings, (I really should pay attention to closing times!) I was finally able to dine properly and profusely, and dine I did.

We decided to go for the mini-pitchers, one each and ordered a whole storm of food. A beet and goat cheese salad, a beef brisket panini, a side of latkes and the maki n' cheese rolls! Suffice it to say, we finished every bite.

The Beet and Goat cheese salad was just as advertised, but no less than filling, my plate was piled high with greens and pecans too, it was great to share between two people. The Brisket Panini was a little sweet for my taste, but my partner devoured it wholly with no complaint so I'm sure it was just fine. The latkes were particularly interesting because of the high abundance of leek used, making it a much more flavourful and impressive side. Two of those latkes are more than enough for one person. 

But the piece de resistance was the Maki n' Cheese, I'm not sure who said they weren't hot enough, but when we ordered it came with house made hot sauce which I put liberally on my pieces only to result in swigging down a good third of my beer. Definitely hot enough for me!

We returned a week or so later for the brunch menu and were very impressed. While it was a bit busy, food came very quickly and coffee refills were ample. I devoured the french toast with fruit compote (it was blueberry that day) and opted for the REAL maple syrup which was an extra $1 well spent. My partner ordered the Breakfast pie which I didn't realize came with a BACON CRUST. Yeah, think about that for a minute. All in all, delicious again.

The staff were super friendly both times and when we went for dinner we were all over each others conversations and jumping in with our own stories, it felt like a place I could really warm up to. So if you want staff to treat you like friends, this is definitely the place.

Also, according to the website, the evenings have extended, so stop by til 11pm Tuesday-Thursday, midnight Friday and Saturday and 10pm on Sunday. I know I will!"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch.
The food came really slowly.  I was really wondering why it was taking so long to scramble up the eggs.  
In mu opinion, the classic breakast taste vs price point just ... wasn't worth it.. have to pay an extra $7(?) To get a combo with salad... would rather go to Cora.

The burger at $15 was also not amazing.  Dry and the buns were not even hot.  Again, even say hero burger tasted better.  I guess some special sauce for it would havr been nice.. but it wss just a regular tasting burger, with the potato laks inside thr burger making it taste even drier.

So yes, the potato laks were extremely dry and over fried to the point that i had to peel off the burnt parts.. and when i bit into it, still tssted burned.

The food also arrived slowly especially considering we ordered mostly breakast style food,  

No fruits, no salad, no drinks, and burger with no fries .. and thr bill came to over $80 ... 
It is not the $80 but just couldnt justify the portion or quality, presentation of the food, or the decor and service for that amount.  If you are looking for brunch options, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the classic breakfast and a taste of my friend coconut pancakes, delicious!"}
{"text":"I did it...  I went back.

Let me preface this review by saying that I only went back because it was POURING rain and I didn't want to walk further up Roncy to Gabby's for the beer and burger that we had originally planned. 

Had a couple of beers and ordered the chili cheese fries to share.  I didn't realize they were vegetarian, and was a little surprised when they came, but I am not adverse to vegetarian cuisine and welcomed those cheesy chili fries with love in my eyes.

They were cheesy, not too cheesy, nice smoky flavour from the vege chili, and the fries were great. I would absolutely order this again.

Service was great, I will return to try other things. I really want to love this place... it's getting better reviews as I go, so we'll see what happens next time."}
{"text":"This place is quite the little gem hidden behind its surrounding restaurants. We almost walked by it! Glad we didn't and decided to give this place a go!

The service was prompt and extremely friendly! It's very small and cozy. I love the atmosphere for a quiet low key lunch. The table pictures are fun to look at as well.

On to the food! We ordered the meat muffins, Maki rolls and potatoes latkes. I absolutely loved the meat muffins! The sauce was amazing and added so much to it. My fiancée devoured the maki cakes- to the point I was only able to try one before he polished it off. Potato latkes were good! However, mental note to myself probably not the best idea to eat after a dental visit!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic little Parkdale/High Park/Roncy Village gem this place is. 

I was pleasantly surprised. A friend recommended it for a dinner out. We hadn't seen each other in a year so I was leery about going to a place I've never been because I'm paranoid like that - what if the food sucks? what if the service is awful? what if it ruins the whole vibe? 

Anyway, it was awesome. Two of us had an appetizer, main and dessert each, plus friend had two beers and I had a pop (a cold pop, ain't nobody got time for that) and the cheque? It was $46!  Crazy, right? 

They have some signature dishes like their maki n' cheese and squish squash quesadilla. Some very interesting, innovative dishes but nothing sickeningly complicated- still food. 

I had the beet salad (complete with mixed greens, candied pecans and feta cheese), the poutine (vegan gravy and you would never know, so now I call it a \"healthy poutine\") and a slice of key lime pie which was dee-friggin-licious. 

Friend has the mango cold rolls which were super-messy though I think they always are, the squish squash quesadilla and the key lime pie, too. 

Everything was great- food was delicious, served at the right times and temperatures, server was fantastic and not pushy in the least. 

The atmosphere is lovely- quiet, open kitchen, nothing crazy fancy. Just relaxed. 

They accept debit and credit and I can only assume cash- but who carries that anymore? 

And here's why they get 5 stars and it's not even technically their fault- because of the location (just North of Queen Street on Roncy) a couple of, let's say \"shabby\" gentleman made their way in. While they may not have been intoxicated they certainly sounded like they were. They sat down at the bar which I had thought was for decoration, and ordered two bottled beers and bitched about the price ($6 per). The server was much lovelier to them than I would have been , especially when they started creepily hitting on her. It's one of those neighbourhoods, like Leslieville or similar places, where something like a pair of loud-talking old drunkards, can really ruin the vibe. But the staff were, as I said, gracious and served them what they ordered. They are better people than I am. 

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Walked here for a burger and a beer, and loved the atmosphere and unique offerings. Ended up getting a standard burger and split the poutine offering with a friend. The burger was a little under from what I'm used to, and tended to fall apart pretty easily; the taste was fine and I liked the oka cheese though. The poutine was quite meh.. just didn't have the flavor I expected. Another person in our group had the sweet potato fries and they were excellent, however. Good drink menu too! 

All in all its a neat place with friendly and attentive service; the food musters a two for me but everything else is a solid four."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, tasty menu with an eye to people with food sensitivities and allergies.  

Went for their 1st brunch on Saturday and wasn't disappointed!  Good coffee that just keeps on coming.  Good portions for the price.

Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"A great new brunch place and I have high standards. The owner seriously knows her stuff and i even insisted nobody eat until I took photos it was so scrumptious looking. Plus your vegan, veggies and bacon loving friends will all have a smile. Bonus * OH: pitchers of yummy hangover helpers are only $13. A little loud but great for a crowd! Coffee/Juice brunch, tax and tip about $15."}
{"text":"What would have been a 4 star experience when I first ate here back a year and a half ago, seemed lower in quality upon my revisiting. Things were still good, but for some reason my Hawaiian French Toast seemed lacking. What originally was fresh cut pineapple in the chutney mix atop the french toast, is now more of a smaller sliced pineapple. And despite even ordering an extra side of bacon in addition to the main meal itself, the plate it was served on seemed comically small for food that involves cutting up into smaller pieces. I understand for presentation when serving up 2 pieces of french toast that the smaller plates make things look better/bigger, but I'm a guy whos more into functionality.

As mentioned, things were still good and I'll probably come back again, but things were not as impressive as my original experience. One thing I will say that did impress me though, is their dessert. We ordered a raspberry brownie and key lime pie square to go to enjoy later in the day, and at only $3.50 they were an impressive treat even without the whipped cream and such that would have been issued if eating in."}
{"text":"Let's pull this band-aid quickly: Cardinal Rule is gross and overpriced. Despite being a fairly dingy diner with unappetizing decor and staff, this restaurant could still be a worthy neighbourhood spot--if only the food wasn't essentially bullshit and totally overpriced. Don't even tell me about deep-frying macaroni and cheese and calling it a maki-and-cheese, or baking meatloaf in muffin tins and calling them... yes, meat muffins. Basically this restaurant is the food equivalent of white-girl dreadlocks in a jester's hat. Wouldn't we say the 2 cardinal rules of restaurants are: quality food at a fair price? This grimy gouger disobeys both."}
{"text":"Cardinal Rule should be that you treat your customers like paying guests. All the over hype set us up for disappointment, from the \"decor\": Value Village on a budget, to the food: Kraft Dinner with an additiopn, or meatballs in phylo paper, a brisket sandwich that felt like it was glued together? WTF? As for service, things were slow when we ate there, so the waitress pulls out a step ladder and climbs up to the ceiling to change a light bulb!!! Perhaps this was the floor show, but fopr two gay guys it didn't amuse in the least, were we supposed to visually follow her up th eladder and hope for a peek? I think not. I understand they have a beverage service, coulda fooled me. Cmon girls, think like a customer and give them what they want, or the cardinal rule is\"you won't be able to pay the rent in six months."}
{"text":"NOTHIN' COULD BE FINER THAN THIS QUEEN & RONCY DINER!

A fresh twist on the 'neighbourhood diner', Cardinal Rule blends local ingredients, decadent combinations and generous portions to satisfy most any craving you could desire. Added to the mix are some fantastic local beers (Mill St., Beau's and Wellington to name a few), sweet tunes in the air and caring staff who make you feel at home be it your first, second or thirty-third visit.

Signature dishes include \"Maki n' Cheese\"- a wholly original comfort dish that blends several of my favourite things: mac n' cheese, meat (veggie option too) and crispy-fried outsides; a Spiced Rum n' Cola \"Brisket Panini\"- served with smoked provolone (one of their best dishes in my humble opinion); and a \"Roast Beet Salad\" that is filling enough as a main course, but can also be served in a smaller portion as an appetizer or side dish.

Cardinal Rule also offers a generous selection of vegetarian and vegan options, which most other local diners can not come close to matching. They serve a decadent brunch I hear, but as of yet have only made it in for supper (and ordered the brisket three out of four times)...

It's very refreshing to see a new option in the Queen & Roncesvalles area that cooks outside the box, while still maintaining freshness and  yumminess, not to mention value. Drop in for a meal, try a signature dish, and hop on the one-way express train to Flavour Country. Trust Me: Cardinal Rules!"}
{"text":"We were here the other night and it was really good! The service was a little slow but we were forewarned, and with a small kitchen, that's simply something you have to expect. My veggie burger was very good and my date's brisket sandwich was good, she says. The prices are entirely reasonable and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"I was really wanting to like this place. It's so nice to see places along that strip that aren't McDonalds. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is hip and casual, but the food? Meh. I had the sweet potato quesadilla (it had a fun name, damned if I remember it) and the tortilla seemed stale. The only flavour I got from it was a sort of smokey taste from the yam being overcooked. The second time, I got a chicken quesadilla. It was better, but still didn't have much of a \"wow\" factor. I realize I'm basing this rating solely on their selection of quesadillas, but it seems like a menu item that would be the hardest to f*** up... am I wrong??"}
{"text":"I rather enjoyed this little place. Which I must say, I completely walked by. I was following the blue dot - and I still missed it. It's the unsuspecting signage.  I tell you, they would make their business even busier if you could see the name.

Alright, that being said. This is a busy place on a Sunday. You feel guilty wanting to chill and casually eat but seeing the line sure starts getting to you.

As a first timer, I had heard every kind of review about this place. I am glad to say my experience was pretty awesome. For those of you with gluten or whatever type of allergy this place completely caters without having you feel like you are at some health food store.  

I ordered the breakfast pie with greens. It was a damn tasty pie filled with bacon, potatoes and I swear some kind of green but who cares it had bacon.

Servers were friendly, prompt and funny. Reasonably priced for this hipstery place. I can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Best brunch place in Roncy... Potato latkes are worth the visit alone... Bacon infused Caesar not for the faint of heart.

Been there a couple of times now.  Nice to see place that a venue can make a theme out of hangover remedies.  The Cowboy Benny is a favourite, poached eggs atop pulled pork on a southern style biscuit.  Get out the paddles...

Service is always friendly.

Looking forward to having dinner there at some point, as they appear to have plenty of interesting menu items, and a variety of theme nights (trivia etc.).

Another great option in the crowded Parkdale/Roncy neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Would not return or recommend to friends. Place is dirty and small and staff are not helpful or accommodating. Way overrated and not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting a lot, but I thought that this place was rather OK. After reading a great review, I made a point to check it out! The menu sounded awesome! 

The food was edible- totally, but perhaps sounded more impressive on paper than in execution. For example: \"Meat Muffins\"- advertised as mini meatloaves are nothing but meatballs on phyllo pastry. Tasty though. We ordered the Maki n' Cheese which would have benefited from way more jalapeño flavour rather than the tiny sliver stuffed in the middle. It literally tastes like Kraft Dinner. Good portion size however.  I ordered the veggie burger which was homemade and had good flavour but it was really overcooked and tossed on a couple of cold \"One Buns\" ( I buy these at home) and the $3 side greens were nothing more than a handful of boxed mixed greens with a vinaigrette and nothing more. The Noodle bowl noodles were quite undercooked and really chewy.  We tried to order the beet salad but it was unavailable. 

The service however was great. Friendly and attentive. 

The decor was a bit on the shabby side for a new place- really dark, but this suits the neighbourhood I suppose. 

I would come back and try the curried apple salad or the beet salad, or maybe a pulled pork sandwich (looked good), but not in a huge hurry. I did have a nice time though given the good service and the company."}
{"text":"We went here after some friends recommended it to us. One of our party was a vegan so we decided it'd be nice to go somewhere she had alot of food to chose from.

I had the Brisket Panini & it was not as advertised on the menu. It was dry and not tasty, and the meat was too chewy. It has the \"featured on you gotta eat here\" logo next to it on the menu, yet it was very bland. 

My friend got the Veggie burger and he said the patty was basically a falafal and he wasn't very impressed & it wasn't very good. 

The plates that our food was served on was barely big enough to hold the food. 
My water was warm, and they couldn't sperate our bill for us. 

 I won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"Yummy time in your tummy!  Been a regular here for a couple of years... Enough said :)"}
{"text":"Wildly overpriced, mediocre food, smells like damp ass inside. I ordered the coconut pancakes (read: pancake - it came with ONE lumpy ass pancake) with a side of bacon and my friend ordered the pineapple french toast. The serving sizes were tiny for the prices we paid and the food was bland. Just go to the grocery store and pick up some frozen eggo toaster waffles and/or pancakes and some microwavable bacon for a meal of the same quality and a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I found the owner and the chef really friendly and willing to chat about their concepts and ideas with us. 

Total unique menu and innovative (in my opinion, stoner type food, which is not necessarily a bad thing).  We had the pulled beef brisket sandwich with a coke and Rum glaze and Kraft Dinner Fried Maki roll which were both amazing!

And this is kind of cool... every end of the month there is a open party with a DJ, dancing and drinks... Enter you name in a draw and you become the guest of honour!  You have a chance to get your drinks on the house, gifts etc... in other words it's your surprise party!.. I will be there next month for sure."}
{"text":"Got here late-ish on a Friday evening just after the kitchen had closed, but when the server and chef saw out pathetic crestfallen faces, they reopened it just for us. Amazing! 

Icing on the cake was that the food was pretty yummy - especially the deep fried pickles (waaaaaay better batter than you typically get). Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest with this place...

I love the food. It's great dinery/pub food (for dinner, not brunch). Excellent vegetarian and vegan options that are a bit out of the box.

BUT!

They seemed to have just raised their prices substantially. My friend had a veggie pulled pork sandwich for $13. He assumed it came with some sort of side for that price, but nope. It came all by it's lonesome on a plate all by itself. You want fries? An extra $5! So for a sandwich and fries you're paying 18 bucks! For this place, that's a lot of money. 

I had the tacos for $14. Came with 3 small-medium sized tacos with no sides or toppings. 

My other friend had the veggie volcano. No complaints there - worth the $13. 

I don't mind paying fair prices for food, but throwing a few french fries on a plate with a sandwich, or some rice and beans on a plate of tacos would go a long way with me. I used to come here often but it's unlikely I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"The service is always sweet, nothing too spectacular happening with the food. They do make the place very cheery and comforting which isn't easy for the space they're working with.

It's a good casual spot for drinks and munchies in a cute neighborhood but nothing to write home about on a normal day."}
{"text":"Sorry kids, not impressed.  Stopped by this place last Friday for dinner & drinks.  As we became vegan a few months ago, our dining options are now much more limited.  We chose this Cardinal Rule based on the numerous vegan options on their menu and the generally good feedback on the place.  It's a smallish and cozy space, nicely decorated and inviting.  I was excited at the prospect of their theme nights (trivia, etc) and hoped maybe this would become a regular joint for us.

The booth we were seated at wasn't wiped down well and had dirt/food in a couple different places.  I was willing to forgive this oversight if everything else was stellar but sadly it wasn't.  Our server was friendly enough but not very attentive.  After we finished our drinks early on (like after the appetizer) he never asked us if we wanted another round (hello! booze=easy money for restaurants!), nor did he take away our empty glasses or refill our water.  We shared some fries which were fresh and good, probably the best thing about the meal.  For mains I had the Volcano and bf had the Vegan Pulled Pork Sandwich plus we shared some Squish Squash Quesadillas.  Bf put it best when he said \"it sorta tasted like they tried to throw something together with leftovers\".  They're obviously trying to put together some unusual flavours, but it's not quite executed right.  Food's alright, but not great.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Loud music, divey atmosphere, so-so veggie burger, quite heavy and dry. Water tasted moldy; maybe it was the plastic ware it was served in. Friendly waiter, prompt service."}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment for us. Came with the family in search of a new vegan gluten-free restaurant, but will not bother to come back. 

Food was greasy and uninspired. Service was friendly, but slow. 

I ordered the potato latkes, which based on the reviews, I expected great things. I can only assume the people raving about the latkes, have never had them before. They were deep fried (ugh) and only came with sour cream. For a restaurant that is offering vegan options, some applesauce would have been a nice option. As it was, the only vegan condiment was a garlic aioli, which was not a great pairing.  

Both hubby and child ordered the veg burger on a gluten free bun with sweet potato fries. The burger was relatively tasty, but greasy. Hubby thought the \"bun\" might have been some deep fried potato concoction. Fries were good, but he ordered the Cajun version, and they either neglected to season them, or you just can't taste it. 

The service was slow...we waited too long to order, and then sat with our dishes stacked, waiting to order dessert. After a time, we just waved her down and asked for the bill, as we didn't want to wait anymore. It wasn't that she busy either, she just wasn't paying attention to the floor. There were only three tables at the time. 

Not a terrible place, but if you are hardcore vegan or celiac, you may want to look around for another alternative, as they don't guarantee no cross-contamination."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vegan Sunnyside Breakfast - Polenta Cakes, garlic aioli, tomato, side latkes, fresh fruit, baked beans.

The polenta was disappointing. I'm a polenta aficionado so maybe for a polenta virgin they would be a good experience. However, I am a woman of refined polenta palette and I say -nay.  The baked beans were quite good though.

I enjoyed the retro ambiance and our server was nice (decked out in retro garb as well). Overall a nice sort of hipster brunch joint with okay food."}
{"text":"Worst burger I've ever had. One of the worst and disappointing dining experiences I've had in Toronto.

I had been to Cardinal Rule a couple times before, and it was pretty alright. Tonight we went to try their special for burger week on the eve of the last day. It was the 4th burger I had during the festivities, and by far the worst. It was really tiny, really dry and really charred. My girlfriend could only get through half of the burger, and regretted eating even that much, and both of us left with charred tastes in our mouths. When we were there, we also got two sides. The brussels sprout slaw and fries. The brussels sprouts slaw claimed they were shaved (they were not, they were roughly chopped), and claimed it was tossed in a honey mustard mayo, but it tasted more like pure mayonnaise, and it really needed some acid. I will say the fries were pretty good. Though I felt like I paid 25 dollars for a bowl of fries.

The server we had was quite nice, and she was doing the best she could, but they were extremely under staffed. I think I saw one guy in the kitchen, and one girl serving. We had to wait a while for everything the entire time. It's the closest I've ever been to dining and dashing.

It was such a disappointing burger, we ended up going to Rude Boy afterwards because we didn't want to end our burger week off on a sour note. The burger we had there was fabulous. It was like night and day. I don't think I could ever return to Cardinal Rule sadly. For their sake, and their customers I hope they improve."}
{"text":"A great hang-out place.
The decor is lively and trendy.

Best place for snacks in Toronto!"}
{"text":"THE BEST restaurant on Roncy! The staff was super nice, and the meal was delicious and inexpensive. I'll be back. Maybe tonight."}
{"text":"I wish I could take this place home with me! The service, food, and atmosphere is amazing. The playlist is perfection. If I lived close I'd be here several times a week or more. Whether you're an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or Celiac, this place will have something amazing for you to eat and drink. I'm the latter, and just had onion rings for the first time in 6 years. F'ing incredible. Handmade batter and smoky Aioli on the side. The burger is also ridiculously good, homeground brisket made to order! Yummmmmmmmmy!!!!! Seriously Cardinal Rule you're my favorite. Thank you and please stay open forever cause I WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"I don't often find bars cozy till I walked into this cozy pub/restaurant in Roncesvalle village. 

There is that perfect serenity in this place with the right balance of friendliness from the moment I walked into the place and from the breath taking home cooked comfort dishes being whipped up by the most coolest chef ever! 

My favourite items to order (yes I have gotten too cozy with this place and have been dining here once a week for last two months) are warm and creamy mushroom soup, oh My Lanta I have died and gone to heaven MAC n' CHEESE, and Grilled Cheese Sandwich which is comprised of  Four ooooey goooey Cheeses on a ciabatta warm and toasty please roll into bead with me Bread....Did I mention this place is cozy :-D"}
{"text":"Maybe this is more of a dinner spot but I'm never coming back here for brunch and I would actually like (and deserve) most of my $35 (for two) back from our Saturday brunch this week.  

To quote the eloquent Lauren M... W-T-F!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The good:
- the space is nice
- The menu is very clearly labeled with vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options
- The beer options looked okay 

The bad:
- The service was very laissez-faire and I felt like the wait staff hated us from the moment we walked in.  Hey, sorry to ruin your morning by being a customer during your open hours... my bad?
- The restrooms were not clean and did not have soap
- Our food took.... over 30 mins to arrive, but less than 40 mins.  There were 3 or 4 other occupied tables.  We ordered standard brunch fare - bacon & eggs and french toast. I definitely could have whipped this up faster at home.
- They brought me the wrong eggs.  This was quickly remedied and not a big deal but other reviews have also noted that they aren't 100% with the ticket accuracy. The eggs were cooked nicely - sincerely - but it would have been nice to have all my hot food come out at the same time.

- The french toast... holy shit I am about to go on a rant here.  Forgive my creative list spacing but this deserves it's own review and I want to be sure to draw your attention to this epic ripoff of a dish.

--The french toast is 2 pieces of chemical bread of some sort (Dempsters, wonderbread... I don't know, you pick) breaded and fried (and takes 35m to make apparently). Like gross-ass 1cm thin bread.
--That's it. It is $8. it comes with nothing else.  (for comparison: the french toast at Sadies that comes with fruit and hashbrowns and 3 large pieces of beautiful french crusty bread... and is also vegan and the same price).
--To add toppings (seems like they have a topping-du-jour) it's an additional cost.  
--REAL maple syrup is available... AT AN ADDITIONAL COST. 
--Seriously, the markup on the \"french toast\" piece of shit that was served for $10 has to be like a thousand percent; 2 pieces of chemical bread... ~25c. batter... let's just say 50c because it's a vegan batter and I'm sure they would argue it's very pricey.  Around 75c.  At 8$ for a 75c item, even including labour, don't you think it should come with some fruit and hashbrowns and syrup? I was so offended when they put this down in front of the person I was with. I wanted to leave. 
--I wish I had taken a photo of this because it was so awful. I can't believe they could even deliver this to the table with a straight face.
--SURPRISE! It wasn't good.

- it's cash only and they have a \"I get part of this fee, hahaha\" gypsy bank machine prominently displayed for your convenience.

In summary, this is one of the most terrible executions (food wise) of a great idea that I was excited about that has had the misfortune of disappointing me in a long time.  The food was not good, the service was not good and it was expensive as all hell for one of the worst cumulative brunch experiences I have had in Toronto.

I hope someone else buys this business, fires these jokers and them starts pumping out some good food from the kitchen.  ONLY then would I even CONSIDER returning.

WHERE SHOULD YOU GO INSTEAD: Easy (right around the corner) for brunch and there are SO many other dinner options I won't bore you with the list."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. 
Tonight I was eating dinner when a couple with a screaming child came in. Everyone knows to expect a little disturbance when they leave they house. But this couple refused to let people eat in peace. They refused to go outside for even a minute. When I voiced my concerns to my server she promptly and politely asked the offenders if they would mind quieting down the child elsewhere. This went on for 5 minutes. The father was threatening the complainant (me) and our server had enough. She asked them to outright leave. Thank the good Lord for servers who care about keeping order!"}
{"text":"Cardinal Rule is a solid choice for harmoniously satisfying both veg'ns and carnivores at the same table. I've eaten here a couple times now and have been very happy with the food, service, and laid back atmosphere.

The breakfast special is humongous and just what your belly wants when you roll out of bed after a big night out. The meat muffins are fantastically comforting and indescribably addictive. The mango cold rolls are light and appetizing. The Shanghai noodles are nothing special and frankly a bit petite, but do the job. The club featuring real (vs. processed deli sliced) meat, grated cheddar, and raspberry aioli is one tasty rainbow of a sammich. OJ and house wine in half or whole bottles wash everything down nicely.

The service is consistently genuine and relaxed. I'd come here more often if it was open every time that I came a knockin'."}
{"text":"this is my 4th time eaten. i remember it used to be better. my friend and i had the maki n cheese (half), the potato latkes, and the shrimp tacos. the maki n cheese is literally deep fried KD cut up in sushi roll shapes...sundried tomatos wrapped in between served with green onions and dollops of ketchup and mayo. the potato latkes came in 2 pieces...super crunchy with sour cream on the side. my friend thought they could have put more seasoning and i agreed. the shrimp tacos came in 3 with 2 coconut shrimps in each. they had mango salsa as base which was good the tortilla however could be more fresh...i thought they were stale. the wasabi sauce on the taco had the perfect kick and tied in every flavour. the atmosphere is very intimate. loved the lights wrapped around the air duct!"}
{"text":"Checked out Cardinal Rule for dinner with a friend.  She has gluten allergies so we're always on the hunt for places that can accommodate.  That's the good thing about Cardinal Rule - their menu offers selections for vegetarians, vegans and gluten allergic.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the cool painted argyle pattern on the wall...love the teal and black colour combo.

I ordered the veggie panini ($7) and soup of the day which was parsnip pear ($5).  My friend ordered the mango cold rolls ($4) and the small noodle bowl ($6) with a glass of shiraz ($7).

My sandwich was good but very run of the mill - vegetables with goat cheese and pesto on a thin hamburger bun similar to the ones you can get at Loblaws.  The soup was decent - a simple puree of pear with a hint of parsnip and a bit on the lukewarm side.  The panini didn't come with a side or a garnish which I found somewhat offensive.

My friend's noodle bowl was a generous helping of soba noodles accompanied with a few sprigs of baby bok choi.  Mango rolls were decent.

Service was very friendly and food came in an appropriate amount of time.  I did notice that the restaurant smelled a bit like old lady potpourri and the scent of cigarette smoke wafted in but no one was smoking in the dining room.

Could be a fun place for drinks and/or brunch but I would probably pass on coming back for food.  2.5 stars all around."}
{"text":"W-T-F!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WORST brunch I have ever had. So completely gutted over how absolutely horrible the food was. I'm sorry, I don't say it often, but it was incredibly bad.

Went all the way to Parkdale just to visit this place as the reviews have been great. Cardinal Rule seems pretty cool inside - kitshy decor, friendly staff, cool tunes. I was feeling a 4 star vibe until the food hit the table.

I ordered the \"Hawaiian Stuffed French Toast - \"French toast stuffed with peameal bacon and mozzarella cheese topped with home made pineapple chutney.\"

Sounds pretty delicious, right? UGH. There wasn't a single component of this dish that didn't suck serious ass.

My \"french toast\" was made with multi-grain bread with seeds in it. (To be honest, I'm about 90% sure it was actually Dempster's bread from Metro supermarket). Nor was the bread even battered and fried correctly. 

It came out looking like a soggy sandwich (Dare I guess, microwaved?) with the tiniest piece of peameal bacon and some nuked cheese inside. The \"home made pineapple chutney\" was in fact a 2-centimeter piece of a canned pineapple ring placed on top of the sandwich.

The presentation was horrible and the serving size was tiny. It was TERRIBLE. 

My dining companions had equally bad luck with their brunch selections. I'm wondering if the usual cooks/chef were not present, because what we were served was completely unacceptable to serve customers.

The food took 30 mins to hit the table too, despite only 3-4 other tables of diners.

So disappointing. Ugh. Pass."}
{"text":"the food here sucks. the descriptions make everything seem good. but then the food comes: and it sucks. bland, wet, not good to eat. they think they're hot shit cos they were featured on a canadian-produced guy fieri knockoff show that nobody even watches.

 go here: if you like food that tastes not good."}
{"text":"Good place for a Sunday family brunch for 4 adults and 4kids. We came early and got a table no problem. By the time we got our meals, there was a line up at the door.  Service was so so, the waitress was good but there was a screw up with my gf salmon eggs Benedict. They ending up bringing her the bacon one and she doesn't eat meat. They said that the salmon is no longer available so they sent something else.  Of course she sat there while everyone else started eating. The other dishes were fine and prices ok. I probably won't go back, there are other better options nearby that are better I think."}
{"text":"I'm glad I checked on my order after waiting forty minutes while the smell of cigarette smoke--from where I'm not sure--washed over me. The waitress hadn't put our table's dishes through to the kitchen, so we'd been sitting waiting on food that wasn't coming. A mistake I would understand if the place was packed, but we were one of two tables. Maybe they would have noticed had they not been chatting with friends the entire time. I'm actually dumbfounded that this happened and wonder how long we would have sat there before someone thought that, right, we ordered food. Waste of time. Fucked up my whole afternoon plans. Avoid."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and for a diner I found their food to be quite unique. The maki n' cheese rolls which is fried Kraft Diner with a stuffed center, was a winner. Today the cent re was cauliflower and broccoli and the combination was awesome.
Next I had the brisket which was marinated in Coke and Sailor Jerry's Spiced Rum and really good. 

My only beef with this place is really quite small but worth mentioning. We were asked if we liked hot sauce and given a small dish of home made (amazing) sauce to go with our order. When the bill arrived I noticed a $1 charge for hot sauce. It's not a big deal but I would have liked to know I was paying for this even if it's just a buck.

Apart from that, I found the service to be fast and personable and the music generally awesome. The owners were all in a chatting us up about their monthly \"Surprise\" party. Every last Friday of the month, you are invited to go to Cardinal Rule for dinner, stick around for drinks and dancing and enter your name in a draw. At midnight they pick a name from a hat and the winner picked is deemed the guest of honour... in other words its YOUR surprise party! You get gifts and drinks on the house etc... I am kinda bummed out I can't go to this month's but I am definitely gonna check it out soon."}
{"text":"This place is delightful.  With a playful menu of delicious diner treats ranging from health-conscious to indulgent and staff who clearly want to be there, Cardinal Rule impressed the heck out of me.  

Weary from a day of travel, bf and I headed in for dins.  We shared the maki mac and cheese, which to my happy surprise was made with actual Kraft Dinner and was as good as its description sounded.  He got a veggie panini and I had the squash quesadilla.  His sandwich was really tasty, but I think bfffo was a little jealous of my dish, which had super creamy goat cheese, walnuts, and other treats to complement the squash.  It was a really refreshing spin on the 'dilla, which has a tendency to feel like a mundane option at other places.  

Our servers were really attentive and everyone on both sides of the counter looked like they were having a great time.  The atmosphere: cool, cozy, relaxed.  Good music.

The prices are great too!  If they keep it up I'm gonna put these people's kids through college!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch this past Sunday with my brother and sister-law. 

My sister-in-law selected it because of the veggie options. I was very pleased with the vegan options (even though I'm not vegan). 

Service was exceptionally attentive. Great main server (young, cool, tattooed lady) and two other very young guys who supported the main server. Everyone seemed to compliment each other. 

We ordered the Vegan Breakfast, Breakfast Pie, and the Breakfast Burrito. All looked and tasted great. Their own hot sauce was super delicious. 

We hung out for a while after we finished our breakfast, and while everyone was buzzing around serving other customers, they kept our coffee and water full. 

Great service. Great food. I'm going back."}
{"text":"Food 1/5 meat balls were not cooked properly. Raw and pink inside. They said it was a new menu position. So far it was unpleasant first visit. I hope it was just a first impression. 

Service 4/5 quick friendly service

Price 3/5 $8 for 4 meatballs 

Will not be back for food. Maybe for beer."}
{"text":"Receiving our food was a lengthy process - it took over 40 minutes (woh!) & once it arrived there were a few order mix-ups.  Bacon & atmix-ups.  Important business.

Their \"veggie bacon\" is really thinly sliced smoked tofu.

I liked this place but at the end of the visit it was 'just okay'.  That being said - I liked their vibe & friendly attitude enough that I will totally be back!  I also appreciate their gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you! This place is cozy and lovely inside with fast friendly service, yummy food... and delicious Caesars!
The bacon Caesar is a must try, as is the breakfast pie and cowboy Benny! 
We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was everything I wanted for breakfast yesterday. I got the standard eggs, peameal, rye and latkes and my wannabe Jewish heart was over the moon. The service was fantastic, the tunes were exceptional and it really just seemed like everyone was having a great time in there.

The vegan menu at Cardinal rule is also awesome. I wish we lived closer to this spot because it merges my constant desire for Jewish deli/diner food with my partner's vegan needs. I seriously appreciate how these guys don't just do the standard tofu scramble but have a bunch of things for the v-inclined amongst us.

Additionally, I highly recommend the Prix-fixe option if you can: the mimosas are available with pineapple, orange, or grapefruit juice and are perfectly sized for a good diner breakie. As well, the coffee is far beyond the standard-issue crap bottomless coffee that diners serve (not that I don't love crappy bottomless coffee).

A solid breakfast with ALL the fixings cost us $20 each. You can't beat it."}
