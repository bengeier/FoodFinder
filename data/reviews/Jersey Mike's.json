{"text":"Strangest jersey mikes i have been to. All the employees shout at the top of their lungs- I almost went deaf from hearing DO YOU WANT MIKE'S WAY?!!!!! Over and over. The food tastes just like every other jersey mikes so I don't know what they are screaming about."}
{"text":"It's. The best sandwich place right now in Laveen"}
{"text":"Glad we stopped in -- first time at Jersey Mike's had been to Subway a lot.  Great community service, and loved the food.  So glad you are here in our area at 7th and Osborne."}
{"text":"Brand new store, never been to a Jersey Mike's but it's next door so give them a try. With a feeble attempt to try and order something healthy or nutritious I go with a chicken Philly and a turkey wrap with a mustard sauce.

Mass confusion between the three workers and somebody forgot to make the wrap so I watch several customers come and go before I'm served.
Get it home and extremely disappointed. The wife's Philly had 3 slivers of sliced onion and one pepper ring with some food product we think was cheese on a pressed pattie of chicken parts.
The Turkey wrap was so loaded with a sickeningly sweet dressing no mustard was recognizable. It tasted as if I requested a dunk in corn syrup. 

For real Jersey food try Pats Pizza Plus"}
{"text":"Way too pricey..... not enough toppings! Won't return ! I could have made one of these at home for a third of the cost.... nothing special  ."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's just opened in Brunswick and I've never tried it so I stopped in for lunch today. I went with the Original Italian to go and it was everything I hoped it would be. Then about 3 bites in I noticed a long hair in my sandwich. So I carefully inspected the other half and found another one. I understand accidents happen but come on...2 long hairs in 1 sandwich. I ended up right back where I was before I started lunch...hungry....well at this point I was hangry. The staff was friendly and fast and the prices are reasonable but hair in my food...not so much. I will go back as this was probably a freak thing but I don't know how long it will take to put this experience out of my memory. The part I did get to eat was really good, that's why I want to give Jersey Mike's another chance."}
{"text":"I have visited plenty of Jersey Mike's. I know this is grand opening day however I would hope that their intention is to gain business rather than send us over to Jimmy John's. I ordered the BBQ beef and the Italian. The bbq beef giant that I ordered had enough meat for a mini. My husband said it tasted like manwhich on a bun. He could not finish it. The Italian I ordered was drenched on one side in the oil as if they forgot to put it inside the sandwich.  I paid damn near $24 for a sandwhich with 3 slices of meat and a manwhich. I'm going to hope that this is first day jitters. If you are going to be a Jersey Mike's, you must make the sandwiches Mike's way and not like you are about to run out of supplies and need to make it stretch. These sandwiches cost too much for that."}
{"text":"Have been to many Jersey Mike's, including this one when it was 7th St/McDowell. Ate at this today with a friend, she had never been to a Jersey Mike's. It was the best Philly Cheesesteak I have ever been served. She had the Chicken Philly, said it was the best sandwich she had in a long time. The crew however, was even better than the food, and that was hard to top. Thanks for a great lunch and for a fun time you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"Great fast service, and the employees were friendly. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with jalapenos and it was made within a few minutes and was streaming hot and delicious. I can't wait to come back and try another sandwich"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are so good!  Love the new sandwich place down the street from the house ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the new location but was forced to leave when no one made my order then proceeded to make the orders behind me. No thanks."}
{"text":"SOS = Slow On Sandwiches...Retrain the staff! What a way to start off at this new location."}
{"text":"Omg my favorite location, they make the best sandwiches! Usually go out of my way to come here to order from my 2 favorite sandwich guys! Sooo happy they have a vegetarian option and Gluten Free Bread!! Yum"}
{"text":"In the time that I was standing in line to order, I was able to do my taxes, re-finance my house and read the first 3 Harry Potter books. So, all in all, a pretty productive experience."}
{"text":"I was starving at work and decided to order sandwiches for myself and my assistant. Ordered with uber eats, and paid 30$ for two sandwiches, two chips and one drink. Driver came with two sandwiches only and said that's all she was given. Called the shop and the said I had to call uber eats. Why the run around and awful service? Why so rude? I just paid 30$ for sandwiches and chips and you can't even tell me if you put it in the bag or not? This place is right down the street and I was so happy to have a sandwich shop close to our office, but this is terrible service and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Subs are small for the cost. Get a better deal and better sub at Mr. Hero"}
{"text":"Been to this location 3x since its opened and not going back. 1st Time, they served a 'bread sandwich' (I.e. very little meat); 2nd/3rd time - poor customer service (i.e 'selective' greeting to paying customers who then wait unnecessarily for an order to be taken), understaffed and no mention of shore points. Unfortunate for a relatively new location and representin' Jersey. Smh"}
{"text":"fresh good food!  best sub I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out. Ordered the chicken philly no onions or pepper. The cheese was said to be provolone but def wasn't. Didn't even ask if I wanted mayo or toppings. I understand they just opened but for almost an $8 dollar sub wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Do not come to this location unless you have an hour to spare!!!!!!.......very slow service!!!!!!.......not the employees fault as there was only 2 people working and couldn't keep up with orders."}
{"text":"Not sure who trained these people on a new location, but they need to go back to customer service class. My friend went there the other day and asked for extra mayo and onion on his sandwich and the African American employee seemed put out and rolled his eyes. Then I went there today and ordered a sandwich. I wasn't offered cheese on my sandwich so I asked after he put tuna on and he said \"hey bud, next time make sure you tell me before you order a sandwich\". It was the guy (seemed like a head person in charge) with high messy hair. For a new location, really rude and not impressed with there welcome. There are a ton a places to get lunch, this place I would pass on."}
{"text":"We were the only customers at the time with 4 employees, one looked like he was on break. They took our order and we stood for 5 minutes watching two employees clean and take pictures of the meat slicer. While a 3rd employee watched them do it rather than ring us up and get our drinks. Once they had cleaned and photographed the meat slicer to their satisfaction. The 3rd employee put on our toppings rang us up without asking if we wanted drinks. This place is new but took WAY too long for a subshop. My sub was good but my friend ordered a roast beef sandwich that had a distinct taste of tuna. I might give them another try but unhappy with the service"}
