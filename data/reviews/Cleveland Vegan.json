{"text":"The gravy and biscuits were unbelievably good.  The Chai Late was not prepared as expected, and not what I would call a chai Late.  It was a chai tea bag in a warm milk alternative with a little foam

Can't wait to come back for more good food.  Will probably skip their beverages next time."}
{"text":"Amazing \"egg\" dishes and even better in house desserts available.  The housemade milk (cashew the day i was there) was so smooth and delicious I had both the Macha and the Mocha drinks.  The owner came out to offer us desserts and was super sweet!  I can't recommend this mom-n-pop restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fabulous !! Everything was delicious and creatively inspired. Go for the 3 for $20, you'll be glad you did!
Take some home, share with a friend! Wonderful, gourmet plant based goodness!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and still not disappointed in anything. Great service, amazing food. I had the cashew egg shiitake Benedict, and it was awesome. You get a huge mound of cashew egg, and the red pepper sauce is really good."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Cleveland Vegan! Everything I've had has been delicious & healthy. So great to have a place like this on the Westside. I highly recommend it even if you're a meat eater!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food made to order. You can watch your food as they make it which makes the wait time worth it. Adorable ambiance, spacious and bright."}
{"text":"Very delicious meals. The kale Mac and seitan with waffles were great! Only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rather than a 5 is because of the portion sizes and slim hours."}
{"text":"Holy vegan meatballs, I loved this place.  I'm new to the Cleveland vegan scene, so my experience has thus far primarily consisted of wading through the menu at Tommy's on Coventry.  I don't get to Lakewood often, but I will definitely be making the drive again for brunch at Cleveland Vegan.

Soy and coconut creamer for tasty coffee?  Check.  Granola with locally homemade almond milk? Check.  Sweet potato enchiladas with homemade hot sauce? Check!
Homestyle potatoes with AMAZING ranch dressing? DOUBLECHECK.

Incredibly nice staff, bakery selection, and to top it all off, half-price deli items.  5 stars, easy peasey.

Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to have some private time with this Mac & Cheese w/kale and peppers that I bought for \"dinner.\""}
{"text":"Great food and even better owners. Justin & Laura know how to create delicious, healthy food to Cleveland. We drove over 40min to get here and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing gyro! So good, wish they had later hours! Can't wait to try the rest of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I spend almost every Saturday here for brunch, and we've never been disappointed. We've had most of the items on the menu, both sweet and savory, and we always enjoy the baked goods and coffee as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food. The dining area is bright and the decor is very \"planty\" (that's good.) If I had the money I'd eat here every single day."}
{"text":"Okay, it's not haute culinary dining on a barge in la Seine, but it is relaxed, comfortable, very afforable,  friendly, bright and clean. The breakfast menu is a pleasant departure from the cliche vegan pankakes, tofu scramble and waffles. It includes Loaded Baked Potato Soup and Chimichuri Avocado Toast. I had the Mashed Potato Cakes for $5. Wow, $5! You can't get even get your shoes shined for $5. Nicely done! My wife had the Pumpkin French Toast Bake, which she \"enjoyed.\" The portion sizes were perfect. Still, because we were about to embark on a very long ride home (with no prospects for a vegan lunch), I also ordered the Biscuits with Gravy and seitan. This was nicely flavored. The homemade hot sauce, though not hot was nicely flavored. However, I did not see or taste the seitan. I was told that it was ground into the sauce. Then, change the description of this dish to something like \"with a seitan infused sauce.\" Otherwise, this place is pretty straightforward. Their bakery items are made on premises, the foods served seem fresh. Very good for a cheap vegan place."}
{"text":"Wonderful fully vegan restaurant located in a pretty neighborhood locale of Cleveland. We didn't know when we might be back again, so we plowed through the menu each ordering a 1-2-3 Cleveland Vegan recommended experience and shared \"family style\". It was a tremendous amount of food and we ate like royalty. Everything was to our taste and we left sated and hopeful that we would find our way back again. Don't forget the dessert!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!  I drove all the way out from Solon to Lakewood. Such a find!!  I really enjoyed everything (and totally over ate)! The hummus and veggies were really lite and yummy. The cauliflower lasagna needed sriracha sauce (imo) but was interesting and I really enjoyed the tofu scramble. I'd say the only thing missing is something for kids who aren't quite on board with the vegan thing. Pancakes would have been great had they buried them in chocolate chips (or sauce) and their amazing coconut whipped cream (OMG!). They do have choc for their pastry items, why not use it to make some dishes more kid-friendly (this way I can bribe my kids to come with me more often). Great meal!!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the Benedict Bowl and my friend had the avocado green curry at the server's recommendation. Though neither dish was what you'd typically consider brunch fare, both were delicious and extremely nutritious. I definitely don't eat enough veggies, and this left me wanting more!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday morning for breakfast. There was only 1 other table occupied. Waitress was very quick to bring drinks and take our order. We got a vegi quesadilla and the Shitake Benedict. 

Took over 30 minutes to get the food. Then, the quesadilla was hot, but the Benedict was not. Furthermore, each tasted a bit odd, but I can't put my finger on what it was. 

After eating, we ordered 2 bagels with garlic butter spread to go. These took another 15 minutes to come out, but they were delicious. 

Next time, skip the fancy stuff and go simple."}
{"text":"This is a Vegan eaters dream come true! I mean they have everything you could possibly think of. If you have never been here your are cheating yourself."}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food done right. Anyone who has dabbled in vegan cuisine knows it's far more than simply salads, carbs, and juices. When you don't feel like busting out your Vitamix or soaking your cashews, this is the place to go. If you're a meat eater looking to avoid meat, this is your spot. In addition, they're so good about food intolerances, for my gluten free/Celiac friends! Portions are large, so come with several and get the 3 for $21 deal. Nacho cheez dip, ranch and hash browns, biscuits and gravy, and coconut cream latte are all carnivore approved. The Beard Buch kombucha, brewed locally, was pretty good as well, though I was under the impression they home brewed their own. As a D.C. native, I was thoroughly impressed that a restaurant in the Midwest in a state known for its meat and dairy heavy dishes could dish out such excellent items at a great price point. Go plant-based for a meal and I promise you won't miss the animal products."}
{"text":"Cleveland vegan rocks! I've brought many people here (most were not vegan), and it is well-loved by all. The buffalo cauliflower dip is bomb and not to be missed."}
{"text":"Traveling from Rochester NY I was trying to find a vegan friendly place and this place hit the spot! The food and staff were amazing! We had a breakfast dinner with the lentil sausage, junior scramble and a order of the pancakes and it was amazing. The food came out in 10 mins and was super fresh. The waitress gave us a to go cup of coffee complimentary. I was really pleased way to go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cleveland Vegan was my first stop for my weekend trip visiting the city.
I LOVE that Vegan places automatically cater to Gluten-free and any other allergies or preferences--without judgement!
I ordered the Classic Mac n' Cheez Bake with rice (Gluten free option).
My friend got the Creamy Shiitake Benedict with a smoothie and I with a Creamy Strawberry & Banana smoothie. 
Dessert was GF chocolate/coconut bar!
Great food, great atmosphere, AWESOME staff!
Loved it!"}
{"text":"My expectations were far exceeded in the food here. With plenty of delicious breakfast, pastry, lunch, and drink options, no one could go hungry! I came in with a non-vegan friend for a birthday breakfast bright and early on Saturday morning. We were the first customers in and were greeted and told to sit wherever. The space is a decent size, not to small or too large. 

Even though the service was a bit slow, simply because there was a steady flow of people coming in, everything was great! We split the 3 course order and chose fruit, pumpkin baked french toast (yes), and biscuits and gravy (YES)! Oh my goodness my mouth is watering typing this... Carb overload, yes, but it was heaven. And all for 21 dollars! They also have a la carte options for those food items.

I left with a full stomach and full heart, and have raved about that breakfast for the past 4 days. I did not know how vegan friendly Cleveland truly is, but man, when I come back this is going to be my first stop! Love."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Northeast Ohio. I love the atmosphere, the staff are always friendly and welcoming, and the fact that I can order anything on the menu is AMAZING. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food can be a bit inconsistent. With that being said, I have never disliked what I've ordered. There are just sometimes that it tastes far better than other times. Still, Id recommend Cleveland Vegan 10 out of 10 tines-to vegans and meat lovers alike!"}
{"text":"I came at lunch time so there was a tad bit of a wait but our food came hot and delicious. I ordered the chikn waffles and gravy and everything was super good with very large portions. Nothing here was disappointing and I love that you can order to go! 
Each day they feature 'new' items but only have a specific amount of each made for that day. Once they are gone, they are gone. I follow them on Facebook so I can check daily to see if there is something I want to try for lunch."}
{"text":"First time trying authentic vegan food! The place was very nice, staff were very helpful and informative and the food was so much better than we had expected! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was randomly in Lakewood and decided to give this place a try. I AM SO GLAD I DID! I got the breakfast sandwich and was so amazed ! I went vegan about a month and a half ago. I have truly missed great breakfast but this hit the spot! It really tastes just like a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich! I also got the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin. It was fantastic. I will definitely be back for both of these!"}
{"text":"We went back on a Saturday at 3 pm and the place was full! The chickpea piccata was delicious and the beet burger is back on the menu. It's street parking here but we usually find a spot on a side street. Glad we went."}
{"text":"Cleveland Vegan, the home of the Cleveland Vegan. I cam here with the Cleveland Vegan (BRAGG) actually and she was impressed! The water was vegan, the flowers were vegan, and EVEN the food was vegan! I was thoroughly impressed the with the flower display. However, the water in the vase was not drinkable OR vegan.

Additionally I would like to discuss the wall space. Pretty impressive kite on the wall, I actually thought I was at a kite show, or something like that. Also, BIG fan of the carrots at that place. But, I couldn't see them that well since I didn't have any carrots that day :/

Also, the waiter made me laugh once. 

On a serious note, we did a family style order and the PHOOD rocked - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place during our visit to Cleveland. First visit was excellent portions tasty food. My wife love the place so much we went back for lunch for a second lunch and our food portion was half the portion from the day before with the same price and food had no flavor. The waitress said that the portions were smaller because the bread was bigger. I'm not dumb working in the restaurant business for decades the staff should come up with a better excuse. I will never try this place again. Place is hot no AC and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I should begin by saying that I am not vegan, but I used to lived around the corner so obviously had to try this restaurant. 

Tried it once. Wasn't satisfied. Then I tried it again. Same outcome. Tried it two more times. Still really not feeling it. 

I am so happy it is doing well. Packed whenever I drive or walk by. Guess they are doing something right. Vegan food probably just isn't my thing."}
{"text":"Cleveland Vegan was a catering company that recently opened up their restaurant in November 2014.

The weekend brunch at Cleveland Vegan is simply amazing, offering such items as a vegan eggs benedict (a must try!) or your staple tofu scramble. You can also purchase certain items like wraps, soups, and sandwiches to go, or check out their ever-changing rotation of vegan pastries!

Cleveland Vegan is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly places to visit in Cleveland.

{"text":"I feel like the best way to judge a restaurant is by how long the food sticks in your mind. It's been over two months since I had the biscuits and gravy at Cleveland Vegan, and I still can't get them out of my mind!

When I visited Cleveland Vegan, my friend (a meataterian) and I (a vegetarian) came in with very different expectations. I hoped the food would be tasty, and good inspiration to cut more animal products out of my diet. My friend was just hoping not to be too grossed out.

We each ordered the full 3 course meals, and everything was delicious! And I'm not saying it's good \"for being vegan\", it's genuinely good food that we would gladly order again. As mentioned above, the biscuits and gravy stole my heart, but my friend raved about her cheese steak. My one regret is that we were too full for dessert!

The only reason I'm taking away a star is because of Cleveland Vegan's hours. It's impossible for me to visit during the week when they close at 4pm, and even the weekend hours are pretty limited. If they offered better hours, I would stop in all the time!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Wish they stayed open later. Love the chocolate chip cookies and cupcakes. Will be visiting again"}
{"text":"I tried their brownies and chocolate chip cookies today at the Cleveland Flea. Both items were delicious, so much so that I bought one of each after sampling. These items DO NOT TASTE vegan. They are rich and complex in flavor and texture. I am excited to go to their store in Lakewood next month when they open."}
{"text":"A fantastic new spot for Cleveland veg heads. Mostly delicious options and a friendly staff make this a must if you're a vegan or veg-friendly.

Pros: cauliflower lasagna; adventurous \"omelet\" and English muffin; super moist pumpkin muffin; Brussels sprouts with peanut sauce; chewy and crispy chocolate chip cookies.

Cons: I'm not a fan of the cutesy-hippie decor. It looks like a kindergarten cafeteria. I prefer to sit in a more modern looking restaurant. The light filled space is beautiful though."}
{"text":"We ended up doing the 3 for $20 and then added the bagel.

The corn was really well cooked. It just kind of fell off the cob, but wasn't too raw.

The bagel was delicious. I think I could eat this bagel every day.

The avocado toast was a bit bland for me, but my girlfriend loved it.

We got the biscuits and gray: sometimes you do need the sausage gravy for a dish like this, but this was a good attempt at that.  It was delicious.

The coffee was also very good. 

Overall, I'd go back again, but it was interesting to try a vegan place even though I'm not vegan.  Delicious food can be had in the vegan diet."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! I go about once a week and always look forward to the buffalo tofu wrap;one day they ran out of wraps and they made it into a salad. In my opinion it was even better than the wrap. The cauliflower lasagna was also good. The breakfast and bakery items always look delicious but I try to stay away from the sweets so I have yet to try them. They also use fresh local ingredients and even support local businesses. I used the soap in their bathroom and really liked it; I learned it was also from the local shop on Madison and west 120th area. I am now a fan of both..."}
{"text":"I've lived in NY for the last 20 years and have eaten at a lot of vegetarian and vegan restaurants. I was in town visiting my parents and my Mom recommended Cleveland Vegan to me. I was blown away by how great it is. The menu is extremely innovative. I had the kale and mushroom omelette and sampled several other dishes. They were all great. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. The service and atmosphere is also very welcoming."}
{"text":"BEST place ever. I can't believe it has taken me so long to try Cleveland Vegan. If you've never been, wait no further.

Cleveland Vegan is a cafe located in Lakewood that has some of the best food I've ever eaten in my life. And best part about it: completely guilt free. Everything here is healthy and vegan. If you are someone who would like to try eating vegan or are newly vegan, this place mimics the real thing. 

One of the things I miss most about not eating meat is 1. Buffalo chicken dip and 2. Chili. So of course I ordered both of these menu items. The buffalo \"chicken\" dip, made with a cauliflower base, was to die for. And it tasted 100% like real buffalo chicken dip. I'm still not over it. The chili was also phenomenal. 

The tofu tacos are probably up there in my top 10 favorite foodie moments of all time. I \"mmmm'ed\" through every bite. Cleveland Vegan is definitely one of my regular go-to spots from now on!"}
{"text":"As a first time visitor to this restaurant, making the drive up from Akron, I was blown away by how delicious the food was. I had the breakfast sandwich, and we also tried the tacos, cashew cheese, and sausage gravy. It was delectable, filling, and scrumptious. We finished it off with a powerful, vibrant punch of black grape juice. My boyfriend was delighted by the hint of blueberry in his latte, bringing about nodes of pie. The staff is welcoming and the restaurant is nestled between chic antique shops on a quaint street. Well worth the voyage."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch! Loved everything I had- beet burger, sweet potato hummus and some of my husbands chocolate chip waffle and rosemary potatoes. Yum!"}
{"text":"My first visit. Juice was tasty but a very small glass with several inches of foam. The Reuben was uninspiring. Blocks of tempeh sandwiched in between much smaller slices of bread. Without any type of vegan Swiss cheese to bind things together the sweet kraut mixed with the Russian dressing leaked out into a watery mess on the plate so I ended up eating one bite of sandwich with forkful of sweet kraut chaser. I definitely missed a cheesy component and the bite of a traditional sauerkraut in the mix. The tempeh Reuben at Helio Terra downtown is vastly tastier. I finished with a carrot cake square that was dry with little frosting. Overall - meh. There were other menu items that looked appealing - so worth another try - could just be an off day."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but we managed to try most of the menu and I was a fan of all of it. Dining area fills up quickly on a Saturday morning. It is pretty pricey, but overall very good. Staff was nice too."}
{"text":"So good that I forgot to take photos of the food! 

My boyfriend and I each ordered the $17 brunch where you picked 3 items from the menu. Between the two of us we ordered: yogurt & granola, dollar pancakes w/Apple compote & coconut whip, cranberry pumpkin muffin, junior scramble, biscuits & gravy and the Benedict Florentine. We shared, servings are good sized and fairly priced, even took a little home. 

Everything was top notch, just might be the best vegan food in Cleveland! Our favs were the Benedict (how can you pass up hollandaise?!) and the biscuits and gravy.

We will be back often. Hoping they end up opening for dinner ;)"}
{"text":"Recently bought a dozen cookies here, chocolate chip, peanut butter, and oatmeal chocolate chip. Very delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful. I called ahead and they even baked a few fresh ones on the spot. They have lunch which I would love to try. The interior is really cute with plenty of places to sit. There is street parking outside."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Cleveland Vegan, and I liked Cleveland Vegan, but for some reason there wasn't a real spark. Be sure to check the cooler if you're stopping in for lunch, it seemed there were more options there than listed on the menu so be sure to actually walk over and look so you're not to miss anything. I got a vegan chckn salad wrap and it was good, but I saw a hummus wrap I would have preferred after I already ordered."}
{"text":"The food is incredible and the atmosphere is bright and cheery. Finding great vegan choices is difficult when traveling and this one I will definitely come to often. Grab a few things to go for later. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have the secret. You need to go here with someone you don't mind eating off of, maybe even two or more people. Then you get the 3 course option for $20 and everyone order something different. Mind blown

It's soooo good. That's it and that's all. The thing I enjoyed the most was the biscuit and gravy, I haven't ate meat in soooo long and I loved to have that for brunch. It was nostalgic and delicious"}
{"text":"I had the vegan breakfast tacos they were awesome!  We came in from California for a class reunion in Mayfield Hts and as vegans didn't know we would have any luck finding a place to have breakfast on a Sunday morning. Man was it worth the drive from Mayfield!  You can tell they take great pride in their restaurant.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"You know when I first moved here, I was very surprised at how small the \" vegan community\" is here in Cleveland. 
I was very excited when I first learned about the Cleveland Vegan Cafe, so we came for a early brunch and went with the three course menu. All of the food was good but nothing really stood out except the prices. We each got the three option meal and two fresh juices, the portions were not large either. We left with a check at about $60 before tip. 
I'm happy Cleveland Vegan exists and I understand the need for infliction of prices for small businesses, I get it. 

I would have like to seen larger portions, better quality for the price I paid. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive so if you have the money to spend on Cleveland Vegan- I would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Food is always wonderful and delicious.  Got a piece of chocolate/oreo cake there last month that was HUGE!  Definitely will take vegan and non-vegan friends there."}
{"text":"We were on a vegan road trip and this was the first stop. The Swiss chard Benedict was phenomenal! We also got the junior scramble. The service was very warm and welcoming. Love their logo on the merchandise for sale. Would love to try the other dishes, will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been eager to try out Cleveland Vegan.  I really want to go to the weekend brunch but that'll have to be another day.

I did stop by a couple weeks ago and picked up the roasted vegetables and a soup -- mushroom farro I think is was.  The soup was delish -- rich and full of great flavors.  The roasted veggies were so-so -- nothing to write home about because they were very plain without any seasoning it seemed. 

The place looks very cute -- a number of 4 tops with a very clean vibe and big bright windows making the place feel open and full of energy.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch + cash only.  They have a number of ready to go items in a cooler case behind the counter or you can get carry out from the menu.  I went for the already prepared since I was on my way to work.  

I'll definitely go back -- wondering if my experience and some others who noted the  flavors need to be kicked up -- may be just because they are getting started and over time they will amp things up.  Root Cafe down the street does better with fuller flavors and a little competition can sometimes create change.  Right?  

So, I say -- give it whirl!  It is another small, locally owned business so go have breakfast or lunch and help support our community.  Maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"Loved the fact that they were able to make a chocolate and peanut butter cake for my friend! The cake was cool... not the greatest in my opinion but my friend loved it so that's all that matters. I plan on returning to the place to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"So this review is not based on their regular food menu, but a specific specialty cake. I hate giving a bad review, especially to a Vegan business but I'm hoping this will encourage some improvement. So yesterday was my birthday & my family surprised me with a Strawberry Cassata cake. It's my favorite, and is the dessert Cleveland is most known for. If you want Cassata & can't afford to go to Italy, then Cleveland is where you'll want to go. No one else does it better, so it was disappointing that an establishment that has Cleveland in its name didn't make the grade....not even close. I've had Cassata from Giant Eagle-- a supermarket bakery-- that was divine, so it's not that hard to mess up. It's not the fact that it was Vegan, it's that the density of the cake was reminiscent of banana bread rather than pound cake. There was one layer of custard (if it can be called that) that tasted more like the frosting it was topped with and no sign of vegan ricotta in sight. And the proportion of custard to cake to frosting was off. The \"custard\" layer was so thin, that if it hadn't been for the strawberries in between, I'd have assumed they forgot to put in any layers. The outer frosting was also minimal & layered thin on the sides, you could see a lot of the cake peeking through. The top of the cake was pretty & as it should look. But the sides ruined the effect, and so if you've browsed their facebook page then be forewarned that it may not come out looking as great as those photos. 

I'm not sure if they ran out of product, but apparently this was ordered a week in advance, so not sure how they skimped on supply. Normally, I just pay for bad food & chalk it up to a hit and miss. But b/c we're minimalists who rarely go out, this was supposed to be a birthday treat for me. An expensive one at that ($30 for a 6\" cake isn't cheap, especially to an unemployed person). For the cost, there should've been more substance to that cake (where it counted) or at the very least taste like the name it was given (otherwise, just call it Strawberry-Layered Banana Bread). 

What sucks the most is that I've drooled over that facebook page for over a year, hinting to my family how much I missed Cassata cake & that my birthday is getting closer. I feel bad I got them to pay for this cake, hyping it up only to see them struggling to swallow it down. My mom ordered a Whole Foods Vegan cake awhile back for my sister for $10 less, but as amazing as it was I encouraged the support of a Vegan Establishment, especially one that had a specialized bakery. And I will continue to support them, but probably will stick with making my vegan baked goods at home or trying their cheesecakes instead (I mean they can't mess up cheesecakes too, can they?). Based on the reviews, I'm hoping that I just got a dud & will come back to give them a second shot."}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu changes each season and in just enough time to try something new! The food is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Ridiculous.  The best beet burger.  Smoothies  juices. Dinners. Coffee. Its all flavorful and is so wonderful.  Biscuits and gravy.   Breakfast sandwich.  Chili."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprised at how amazing this place made pancakes out to be. Glad we could finally get in since our hours rarely agree. I had the oatmeal pancakes-don't even bother ordering the syrup because the banana caramel compote and coconut whipped cream is all that is needed on these beauts!  the service was great as was the atmosphere....great place to eat! very happy and satiated!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but this place was awesome!

I know it may sound weird, a non-vegan voluntarily eating at a vegan restaurant, but I have had my fair share of vegan dishes and they were all delicious, just like the food at Cleveland Vegan!

I got the buffalo cauliflower dip which tasted great, probably even better than the non-vegan alternate which is assumed to be buffalo chicken dip. I also tried the roasted corn chowder soup which was fantastic, along with the mac & cheese!

Another important asset of this place is the interior decor. It's very trendy and aesthetically pleasing. The decor all has to do with vegetables, which was neat.

The reason I gave this 4 stars is because we had to not only wait awhile to be seated, but for our food and the check as well. I wouldn't plan to go back because of this... but I might have to because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"I researched all the vegan catering options around Cleveland for a very high-end event we hosted at my office, Cleveland HeartLab.  We had 16 high-earning physicians coming in and needed place that could serve people with expensive taste!

Laura, the owner, worked very hard (and very quickly) to make sure that we had everything we needed for the event.  She even took time to sit down with us when we went to the restaurant to taste some of their food-- the Roasted Summer Salad on their menu, by the way, was absolutely to die for -- and make sure she completely understood our needs.  It was a very cooperative effort and I can not thank her enough for that.

The day of the event came, and we needed her here very early in the morning to set up breakfast.  Her husband and their staff members arrived promptly and set up all the food for us.  People could not get enough of it, vegans and non-vegans alike.  We not only received multiple compliments on the food, but the decor as well.

I will definitely be using them for next year's event and would highly recommend them to anyone that is considering using a vegan caterer!  They are a bit expensive but their service is worth the price and Laura worked with us to cut serving sizes down to make sure we were paying for appropriate amounts of food.

And to add, the favorite things on the menu were the Cajun Potatoes with Homemade Ranch Dressing, and the Lemon and Mint fruit salad.  We even had tofu haters eating the Tofu Scramble!  Very, very pleased with Cleveland Vegan."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this spot. Having a severe dairy allergy, and choosing not to eat meat dining out is always a HUGE struggle here in cleveland. I've tried many different things on the menu and have never been disappointed!! 

The staff is friendly, the food is quality, and the bakery items are BEYOND delish!! 

The only negative thing I would ever say is that I wish they were open on Monday. With that said they still deserve the 5 star review!
Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Good food and great coffee. Staff was super friendly. The food was a good but nothing exceptional. A little slow but they were a bit busy."}
{"text":"I would give it five stars because their food is amazing but it's so expensive. I love their breakfast sandwich but for $12 it's pricey. You don't get a side but you get a 1/4 of an apple or a few grapes. Their chocolate chip cookies are amazing. They have really good sweet treats. My husband swears by their gyro."}
{"text":"I'm Cleveland born and raised but flew the coop the moment I had the chance. I lived in Austin, TX and now live in LA; both cities cater to vegans. Needless to say, I've been pretty spoiled as a vegan. But when I fly home to Cleveland, where do I go? Where's the vegan food? Now, I'm happy to say, Cleveland Vegan!

This place did not disappoint! I brought 3 meat-eating family members with me and everyone loved it! I got the pumpkin French toast bake and the Benedict bowl. Both were amazing! Other food at the table included biscuits and gravy, avocado toast, and the beet burger. I was a bit nervous when my cousin ordered the burger. I think it's easy for someone who's used to beef burgers to be disappointed with veggie burgers, but he really liked it! We shared the hummus, which was creamy and unique. All food was the bomb! And the coffee was delish!

This place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon. Every table was filled. Service was a bit slow because of this, but it was worth it. I think this is a testament that WE NEED MORE PLACES LIKE THIS IN CLEVELAND!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleased with this place. A great option for those who are vegans or vegetarians- basically all food is vegetarian. Also, they offer tasty juices and delicious smoothies. I ordered avocado toast and juice, and almost order second avocado toast- it was yummy! 
In the end, I bought two gluten and sugar free desserts, and they both were spectacular! 
I'm proud that the owner of the place is a polish guy- good job! 
By the way, Carmela- a waitress, was helpful with menu and had a lovely personality!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but almost trying to hard at this place.  The menu options are mysterious, I like pure and simple.  Potato skins fried  in peanut oil and a glass of almond or coconut milk and a lush salad and I'm good.  This restaurant has many options but some more flavorful than others.  Meatless dishes are OK, but not off the charts for me."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a busy Sunday.  The service was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.  The food took a bit longer than expected, but it was worth it.  Everything was fantastic!  The biscuits and gravy are amazing."}
{"text":"I've recently taken on a vegan lifestyle, and my fiance and I kept hearing wonderful things about this place.

We went on a Saturday after looking at houses in the area. The food and service were so great we decided to go the next weekend too.

The buffalo cauliflower dip with pita and veggies is the best I've ever had. Better than any buffalo chicken dip. I got the benedict and my fiance got the lox bagel. The food is just superb. We wanted to eat it all, but surprisingly the portions were decently sized and we were able to take some to go. 

The help is great, fast and efficient. I love the open kitchen concept they have, as you can see the chef's in action. The atmosphere is light and bright. Really, overall the best vegan spot I've had so far in Cleveland."}
{"text":"As a vegan in Cleveland, it makes me overjoyed to see new vegan businesses or even vegan friendly businesses springing up all around town. But I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed by the meal I shared with my mom and fiance on my birthday. 

We all intentionally ordered different things. We split the cauliflower hummus which was possibly the best part of my meal. It had an interesting smoky flavor - probably from the paprika on top? I had the kale and Brussels sprout salad. Everything was finely shredded and it made my salad a little hard to eat. The lemon tahini dressing was pretty bland and didn't add anything to the salad, IMHO. My mom enjoyed her creamy potato leek soup but thought it was salty, and my fiance loved his cajun breakfast potatoes served with ranch, because what's not to love about potatoes with ranch? (the ranch is very solid for a vegan ranch - I bought some and took it home with me)

My sad salad was followed by the multigrain bake. If you're not a vegan and you think about what vegan food tastes like, this multigrain bake would be it - bland, dry, and not that great. I was really disappointed by it. So disappointed that my fiance traded me his beet burger. And the burger itself was ok. A little too crumbly for my liking, but it was alright. My mom's mushroom and kale omelette was definitely the best main dish that we tried, although it was pretty salty, too.

I really hope I just went on an off day or that this iteration of the ever changing menu just isn't my thing, because I'd love for this business to be sustainable and I'd like other restaurateurs to see that a vegan business can be profitable in CLE. But for now? I'm in no hurry to rush back to Cleveland Vegan."}
{"text":"\"Forty is the new thirty\" or so we like to say, when we're ringing in a dear friend's 40th birthday ;-)  We hosted a surprise birthday party over the weekend, and Cleveland Vegan catered it flawlessly. They nailed all of the details including creating custom signage for the food table, ensuring we had the right ingredients for a plant strong meal, consistent and clear communication throughout the process, and the price was right. 

About the food, our menu was corn chowder to start, arugula & quinoa salad, cauliflower lasagna, kale cupcakes & an adonis cake (so the birthday girl had something to blow the candles out on, aside from the cupcakes!). The food was tasty and healthy- how much better does it get?! EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THE CORN CHOWDER including the carnivores at the party.  That's saying something! 

It was a pleasure working with Laura and Justin- I'll definitely have them cater my next event! They definitely know how to feed the masses with delicious and nutritious food!"}
{"text":"Truly vegan and delicious, and when your kid is allergic to dairy and eggs, this is our go-to place. Friendly. Carmela is our favorite employee."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have finally been here! Located in Lakewood, this space is inviting and warm, with cute wildflowers on each table. I found the staff to be incredibly friendly, providing menu and drink recommendations, and letting me stick around to get some work done. They also have wifi, plentiful baked goods, and clean, large restrooms.

I will say the junior scramble I ordered was pretty salty, but I think this may have been an exception, not the norm. The acai latte was delicious and steamed in their house made cashew mylk. Overall, I'm a fan of this space and would love to come back!! 

Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I'm not vegan. But the food is dang delicious. Every now and then something is good and not awesome but for the most part, things are yummy. I've even had a \"reuben\" sandwich here and let me tell you, I think it was better than the meat version. For the portions, I usually have to get either something from the third column or one from the first and one from the second to be full. It's a little pricier, especially for lunch, but they use quality products."}
{"text":"Gotta give it up for Cleveland Vegan.  It's the real deal.  Started Sunday Brunch with a short stack; the coconut, banana, walnut with maple syrup  combo was fantastic.  We shared a kale salad and Massaman Curry bowl.  The crispy tofu in the bowl was great and the coconut milk/curry combo was spot on.  Love Cleveland Vegan and it has now a proud member of my Top Ten Vegan Restaurants List!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. They have a deal that is 3 dishes for 20 or 25$, I can't remember. I got the chick pea tacos, ramen, and edamame hummus. All were delicious and huge portions. I took over half of everything home. Quick service and a cute little place, will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. High quality ingredients , thought and care are put into their meals, and that is not something you experience everyday.

Atmosphere: Bright, airy, sunny, these are the adjectives that first come to mind when describing this place. It is basically one large room, with light wood and large windows. I think it suits the theme well.

Service: Warm and educated.

Food: It is amazing how good they make vegan food taste here. My go to is the breakfast sandwich on gf toast. Im not sure what they exactly do to the tofu, but it's probably the best tofu creation I have tasted! The tofu takes the place of the egg, (and believe me, you don't miss the egg.) accented with avocado, sauce, tomatoes, and I can't even remember the rest but everything blended together perfectly. The only thing I didn't care for was that they put sprouts on it, which wasn't noted on the menu. I just scraped them off but will have to remember to ask them not to add it on my next visit."}
{"text":"I am not vegan, but I enjoy some of the food here. I like the smashed avacado toast and some of the burritos in the front case, particularly the roasted veggie. I think the fresh juice is pretty good. My favorite so far is the Kale lemonade. It's a nice boost of the good stuff, although its a little pricy at $5. They make it right in front of you though so you can see that everything going into it is natural and the whole veggie or fruit, not just the juice. 

There is one dessert that i really like: it's a churro cupcake. At least i think that is what it's called. I have only seen it available sporadically. 

I will say that some of food items I have had here have been a little bland. And in general i think it is overpriced, but i think the quality and care is there."}
{"text":"I hate to be that person, but this place is completely overrated. Judging by the reviews, I was expecting to have my socks blown off. I couldn't have felt further from that. We came this Saturday afternoon (3/24) at around 2:30. The place was full and we waited but only for a few minutes as we were the first and only in line. It took awhile for our waitress to come over. The place is not big. We placed our drink and food orders, as we could tell the service would be slow from here on out. I had a matcha latte and my fiancé had the fruit punch juice. Both very good. Although no offering of sugar or honey for the matcha and it was warm at best. 

We chose to do the pick 3. I did the buffalo cauliflower dip, broccoli cheese soup & gyro. My fiancé got the sausage patties, cheesy potatoes, a side of crispy tofu and the quesadilla. After we received our apps, it took almost 30 minutes to get the other food. The dip was good and so was the tempeh sausage. Again, nothing that blew either of us away. Our waitress never asked how anything was and she never apologized for how long she was taking. The table of 3 next to us also spent a good majority of their time looking around for anyone to serve them, like we did. They even went up the register. Finally our second and third dishes came out...all together. I ordered two hot items, so I'm not sure how I was expected to eat them unless I wanted one to be cold. This wasn't a problem as the soup I got WAS cold. I returned it and received no apology. The gyro was good. The soup was pretty good however it maybe half of the bowl was filled. My fiancé hated his quesadilla and cheesy potatoes so I switched with him. The quesadilla was absolutely terrible. It was soggy, lukewarm and overstuffed. The cheesy potatoes looked like something someone would make when they were high, but they were edible. Crispy tofu was bland and a big waste. Again, no condiments or salt & pepper was on the table or even offered. My fiancé had to go up to the register and ask for salt and then went up again later for hot sauce. We saw our waitress 2 times. I guess for Cleveland this is the best vegan restaurant offering there is however I would much rather go to Tommy's or Townhall. The bakery section pales in comparison to Poisonberry. 

I have been allergic to dairy and eggs my entire life, was a vegan for 2 years back and just recently began being vegan again. This is not vegan health food by any means, however it isn't any sort of unique vegan food either. I have made WAY better vegan food in the comfort of my own home. My fiancé is from NYC and I always look forward to the vegan food when we go back because they really put a lot of thought and effort into the dishes & ingredients. The food leaves a lot to the imagination the presentations are incredibly underwhelming. But the service is was made this a truly forgettable experience. It was almost like the waitress was ignoring us on purpose until I realized she was ignoring everyone. We made the 35 minute drive from Gates Mills to come here and I have to say never again. I didn't find the price point to be that expensive however when you take into account what you're getting I feel like you get no where near your money's worth. The food was NOT worth $60... however it was a lot of food (that we didn't eat). Please take a cue from Champs Diner & by CHLOE in NYC to see vegan food done right. 

This place fell really flat in my opinion. Maybe it's for vegan people who can't cook? I'm disappointed we devoted a Saturday to come all the way out here. I will say the tall man behind the counter was very pleasant as well as a younger girl with black hair was really sweet. Our waitress was an older brunette woman and she was pretty terrible."}
{"text":"Discovered while walking around in Lakewood. Great food, awesome staff, and really cool veggie-themed artwork and decor.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and likable here. The prices are fair and the service is great. We visit at least once a week and drive from Avon. Truly amazing that everything is vegan as vegans usually live a life of picking and choosing. 

Current menu is excellent! Broccoli cheese soup, Chickpea Picatta, Bagel and Schmear, Lentil Sausage Patties, Breakfast Quesadilla, and Potato Cakes are all things I have tried and loved."}
{"text":"We got the loaded nachos, breakfast quesadilla, and coconut curry soup, all of which was amazing. I already can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan option in Cleveland. Creative menu. Simple decor. Cafe atmosphere. Bring a coat if it's chilly, the draft is profound. Had the Mac and cheese.  It was creamy and delicious, albeit a little flat in the seasoning/flavor department. Had the most excellent seitan Reuben.  The creamed sauerkraut was most excellent. Had a shamrock shake for dessert. One of the best St. Patrick's day meals I've ever had. Unfortunately there's not much competition so be prepared to pay the vegan tax with overpriced menu items that don't need to cost that much and scare away non vegans. We're a captive audience so we'll pay whatever, but this common practice of overcharging for vegan fare scares off a lot of non vegans (happens everywhere, not just here).  Suggestion for ownership:  why does a completely vegan restaurant use non vegan candles in the bathroom?  Easy fix however!"}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!!! First you should know they only take cash or check...not sure why.  The next thing to know is that this is a gem in a town that is not vegan friendly.  Michael Symon is great but he's all about the bacon and Cleveland is a bratwurst kind of town.  Starting with the cool veggie decor the decor is bright and the food is outstanding.  I chose the three course option for $19 but all items are a a carte as well. My starter was a lemon chia muffin that would have been great for dessert ( but wait.... They have a whole counter of amazing desserts). They warmed the muffin and seeing as it was a 20 degree day it was perfect. Next up... The kale, brussel sprout, apple and beet salad with lemon tahini dressing. The perfect mix of sweet and tangy...my entree was a beet burger complete with avocado, spinach, and a GF sun dried tomato bun. Vegan ranch dressing on the side brought it all together.  So...I've personally tried to make beet burgers several times and they do not hold together like this one.  I even think your meat eating friends would love this place. Finally...a great vegan place in CLE.  The Root is lovely but I'm glad we have another option.  Please visit for brunch...don't let this awesome place be overlooked."}
{"text":"Best brunch on the west side, vegan or otherwise. If you do the 3 for $20 you will leave with leftovers. Next time I won't do that but my husband (meat eater) and I wanted to try as much as we could. We got the acai bowl, fruit bowl, redskin potatoes w/ranch, beet greens salad, breakfast sandwich (on a bagel), and the seitan & waffles. The seitan & waffles were amazing and the sage gravy was better than any sausage gravy  I've ever had. Bagel sandwich was the standout hit. Ranch dressing is worth buying to take home (which they offer - $5). Fruit bowl was normal and I probably wouldn't get it again. 

They take credit cards and you wait to be seated. They also offer some prepared sandwiches, lots of bakery items, and some sides at the counter you can buy take out style.  I wish I could do 6 stars. Rivals vegan diners in Chicago, Austin, NYC etc"}
{"text":"Love this place...the ambience, food and service! I went for the CV experience and opted for the sausauge patties, avocado toast, massaman curry. The patties were a bit bland so had to ask for some extra dressing, the 'bacon' on the toast seemed very much like meat and the curry was the icing as it was very different from the actual Thai curry.

Since I am a vegetarian, getting pure desserts is difficult and so went in for the choc cake and walnut brownie...phew were they good! Ofcourse, I couldn't finish everything and had to take part of the food and desert home."}
{"text":"Amazing menu choices. Great taste (and I'm not vegan). Reasonably priced. Quaint atmosphere. 5/5 I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the Edamame hummus and the chickpea tacos. I could live off the hummus, a bit stingy with the amount of veggies and crackers to dip in it though. Chickpea tacos were amazing from what I remember. I was satisfied after eating. It's nice knowing I can go somewhere and order ANYTHING off the menu without having to worry about my allergy."}
{"text":"I came here with my vegan brother and his vegan woman for Sunday brunch. The food was delicious. The cauliflower lasagna was flavorful and a large portion. It had a nice zesty marinara sauce. The Benedict Florentine was also a good dish. I preferred the lasagna. The T.L.T. was a nice sandwich. I am not usually one to order potatoes although the cajun potatoes here are worth the starch and carbs. It was sad to see Wings Hobby Shop close forever yet I am glad that Cleveland Vegan serves up tasty and healthy brunch."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday on a Thursday at lunchtime. They were quite busy and soon every table was filled. We both had the Potato Leek Soup and the Kale Omelette. Both were perfectly warmed for a cloudy cold rainy day and the flavors were outstanding. I particularly liked the coconut bacon garnish on the soup. My only minor complaint is it's cash only. Oh, and the hummus was disappointing. Other than that -- a fabulous meal. Would visit again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I got the pancakes & walnut tacos - so good! It was my first time (why did I wait so long??) and I'll happily be back...soon! Great to find a place that uses quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Pretty great! Visiting from cinci where vegan food is nonexistent and I've been a vegetarian for over 10 years. I was really excited about the French onion soup because it was a favorite as a kid and i haven't found a vegan substitute. It lived up to expectations. The service was friendly but the only thing I would change is maybe hire more people because it seemed understaffed for the volume they are bringing in. As someone who worked in cincis top rated restaurant, i sympathize with getting slammed and the staff was still polite and helpful despite this. A little pricy but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we loved it. Very friendly people, interesting art, clean, and of course amazing food. We tried the pancakes which had coconut whipped cream and banana compote. Very hearty and big portion. We got maple syrup as well although it was really sweet enough without it. The bagel with vegan cream cheese was quite filling as well and the cheese had a nice creamy texture. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I originally ordered a cake from Cleveland Vegan for my (non vegan) husband's birthday. He wanted a cake that we could both eat, and I knew from the reviews that the cakes would not disappoint. I was really pleased to see the great variety and options on their cake menu, and he ended up selecting the Oreo cake. The ordering process was very easy. I ordered the cake via email, and they gave me a follow up call to confirm the order and take the 50% deposit. 

The cake itself was amazing! We absolutely loved it, and every bite was delicious. The frosting was incredible, and it went so well with the cake flavor and the Oreo crumbles. I especially loved that in between the layers of cake there were pieces of Oreo layered in with the frosting. It was the perfect touch to make the bottom half of the cake not just seem like chocolate cake with vanilla frosting. We both loved it so much, that I ended up ordering it again for my birthday the following month!

Most recently, my (non vegan) cousin was in town visiting me, and we stopped by for brunch. I ordered the three course option and got the fruit bowl, hash browns w/ ranch, and biscuits and gravy. My cousin ordered the strawberry banana french toast. We shared our food and everything was AMAZING. There are tons of other reviews raving about the food, and rightfully so. The food is so fantastic, that it leaves you super excited to come back and try everything else. Every bite was incredible, and all day we could not stop talking about how good it was. We also got a few bakery items to go- a vanilla cupcake, a carrot cake bar, and a salted chocolate chip cookie bar. All of the baked goods were delicious, and the frosting on the cupcake was fluffy and buttery and delicious. 

I highly recommend checking out Cleveland Vegan, and I cannot wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco, where I'm spoiled with incredible food, and this place ranks with the best. I had their breakfast sandwich that included house made tempeh bacon, vegan chipotle aioli, and a delicious English muffin (also house made?). My bf had a tasty spiced chia pudding & granola parfait, plus a bowl of perfectly cooked kale and bites of vegan \"omelette.\" They DO take credit cards, and it was hard to resist the freshly baked scones on the way out the door. Great food, great prices, sweetly decorated space, and really good people working there. Go now!!!"}
