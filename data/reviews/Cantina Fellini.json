{"text":"I had the best gnocchi I've ever eaten, infused with Stilton cream sauce and pears. To die for !!!"}
{"text":"Better than expected. Nice ambience. Waitress very lovely. Food is delicious. A much needed addition to downtown Brampton.  Hope they will succeed."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I've only tried a limited number of dishes, but everything I've tried so far has been flavorful and prepared with skill. It's definitely pricier than my usual fare, but the well-appointed interior and excellent service make it worth it for a special night out.

One thing I wasn't aware of until recently is that they're open for lunch. Downtown Brampton working people: make this one of your lunch spots! Especially for amazing salads, as many of us prefer to eat lightly at lunch. My last trip there I got this pear walnut salad, and it was to die for!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for several months and I finally had the chance to make it.

Right away, the great modern decor is apparent and stands out amongst the other nearby Italian places which are a bit run down (to varying degrees).
The prices are very reasonable too with all the pastas under $20 and most of the entrees under $30. Lunch menu is even cheaper of course and they offer some items tailored to that period (Paninis etc..). I think they may do Sunday brunch too, but I'll have to confirm.

My wife and I told the waitress we had little time since we had an appointment and she said they could accommodate as long as we ordered pasta. My wife went for the 'penne a la vodka', and I had 'cassarecce con pollo' (a pasta with chicken in a cream sauce). Both were very solid dishes, made simply with proper ingredients. And of course they served us with the complimentary loaf of bread as we waiting.

Service was great and they made good on their promise to provide the food in a timely way.

I've just scratched the surface of the menu, but it's enough to warrant future visits"}
{"text":"We went by earlier tonight and there were no lights on. Looked in and the signs said closed for painting, the the place was deserted and there's a For Lease sign in the window."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Service was akin to white glove. Very attentive. Unrushed. 

The starter bruschetta was delicious. Calamari not chewy and the sauce-yum! Wrapped Brie was hot and creamy. 

I had the mind blowing risotto (maybe a little heavy on the truffle). My husband had the surf and turf. Steak was so tender and had two lobster tails. My daughter had the chicken firentina. Delicious. 

The Tiramisu might be the finest I've had. No heavy hand and not super sweet. 

It was my birthday and they brought a shot on fire! Sambucca I think. 

Atmosphere is unexpected. Soft and beautiful. Music was a bit harsh at times in comparison. If you aren't going to do fresh roses on the table, I would forgo the flowers altogether."}
{"text":"Took me several tries to make a reservation since they don't return calls. Finally made a reservation for 4 people at 6pm on a April Monday night to celebrate my sister and my birthday with my parents. When we arrived there were only 2 tables seated and we were the 3rd. Within the first 1/2 hour the restaurant was packed. After we arrived we were given our table then nothing... as tables arrived around us and got drink orders and meals ordered. Nothing... 

At around 645 I had to approach someone because no one even looked our way (we are in the middle of the dining room) the older gentleman said someone will be with you..there was only 2 servers, so I flagged the only other waiter and asked to at least put our drink order in. He said he'd be back after he put an order in but he wasn't and eventually the older waiter came back.... We ordered 6 apps, 4 entrees and 4 desserts. 

At quarter past 7 still no appetizers. 

An hour and 15 minutes after we arrive we finally had someone come by and say the food will be coming soon. 

We have a 15 month old baby with us and with no change table it was a seriously shitty experience so far. 

At 7:30 pm (an hour and a half) no apps, no entrees, nothing. We start hearing about other tables around us complaining they need to be at the rose theater by 8pm. After chatting with some of them I realized that most of them were there for a theater package 2 or 3 course meal. 

At 7:40pm my sister got up from her own birthday dinner and had to leave with her son because his dinner time is 6:30, bed time is 7:30 and at that point he was bawling from being so hungry. We had to go to a nearby store and buy him some milk. So she left without eating 1 morsel of food after traveling from Mississauga to Brampton in rush hour for this present from me.

I approached the younger waiter and told him, I understand all these tables have a show to attend at 8pm. They have all received their appetizers even though we were there before most of them. We shouldn't be put last just because they chose to. 

One of the worst experience of dining in my life. At 7:50, almost 2 hours after we sat down, the restaurant emptied out because the theater was starting. 

THEN... we started getting our food. All mixed up... 1 app then 2 entrees, then another 2 entrees, while the other 3 apps didn't come until the very end. 

The owner was in the restaurant... no apologies. Just the waiters complaining about the situation with the other diners. 

When my parents and I left with my sister's meal in boxes, we were beyond fuming that we were just at a loss for words. 

I paid over $140 for this meal, no discount was even offered. Just a shit show. The food was good... that is all."}
{"text":"I had been here before and when I saw there was an opportunity to return with a Groupon, it was a steal of a deal I could not pass up. They aren't expensive regularly and even have a theatre special.

We had the Lentil soup, which my boyfriend reports was delicious. I had the Mista,  sadly wasn't up to par and they took it back, I was given the option to try another salad but had preferred to progress the meal without it. The appetizer was a goat cheese stuff quesadilla, which was generous and flavourful.
The mains were delicious, it did take 30mins to come out, which was a bit of a wait considering the general timeliness of a meal. But we certainly didn't feel rushed.
The bottle of wine paired well with our meal, the glasses were refilled in a timely manner and were never empty.
For dessert we had the sorbet and cheesecake. I suggest the sorbet, though not bad... the cheesecake was nothing special, but I assure you the sorbet was.

Live musician was very talented. Though a bit loud due to where speakers were...at ear level about a foot from my head.

In all a good experience, however I was sat literally 1 foot from a speaker next to my head  which I didn't appreciate and when asked they refused to seat us somewhere else as they had no tables... but I was lucky enough to watch one be empty for an hour. I suggest removal of that table all together it's a cramp space, they had to keep our bottle of wine on the bar due to how small the table was. Not a very welcoming or comfortable seating arrangement.
As the salad was returned our server offered us a free shot of Limoncello to make up for it, it was delicious and a lovely gesture on her part.
Which made the experience well worth the 20% tip on Before Groupon total ($130) and what we drank etc.

Food - 4/5
Atmosphere 4/5 - The seat I had was horrible due to speaker distance.
Prices 5/5 - Fairly inexpensive with or without a Groupon.
Wine Selection 5/5 - Varied and prices range from $30+

It's a more mature crowd, but it was still fun and has a lovely date atmosphere."}
{"text":"Elegant, romantic lighting, soothing instrumental favorites in the background.   Free parking on Diplock Lane puts you close to the rear entrance. The mussels will blow your socks off. Fresh, hot bread made in-house. We tried the tasting menu from the 'Taste of downtown Brampton'. The veal and cod were excellent. The cannoli was good, the apple crumble was not. Too much crumble and not enough apple or ice cream left it too dry. The prices are very reasonable for fine dining. We immediately booked a return reservation. This place is a gem right in our backyard."}
{"text":"Third time and we love it. Service, food and ambience are great. Adult environment. Leave young children at home. Demographic is 40+ years old. We will return. And we come back! Feb. 24 and another yummy pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"Delicious food  and nice waiters. Make a reservation though as they couldn't handle the pre rose theatre rush...

Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends on a weekday evening over the holidays.   There was only one other table in the entire restaurant that was occupied.  

The waiter made us feel like we were wasting his time and could not even make a suggestion of what was good to try when asked.  He had zero personality.

Every time he brought us our drinks or plates of food, he banged the glasses and plates against other glasses and plates on the table when he was setting them down.  It was kind of like a war zone with the dishes

I would rate food a 6 out of 10 and there's very little selection for dessert. 

I would not waste my money here again."}
