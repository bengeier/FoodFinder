{"text":"Decided to give it a try on the way home tonight. I placed an order online about 3 hours before my pickup time. When I got there, no one acknowledged me, and when they did I waited about 15 minutes for my food. Not sure what the purpose of an online pickup is.. there was also about 5-7 people working in a fairly empty restaurant"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for dinner last night and it was excellent! I remember seeing this place before it was open, but we sort of forgot about it. I'm so glad we tried it. We ordered online and the BF said they were super nice when he went to pick it up. Since we had never tried it, we ordered the Hummus w/ soft pita and the Pimento Cheese with toasted pita (love that you have a choice of mixing them or having one or the other) - both dishes were good. Not the most awesome hummus ever, but definitely good. I had the steak gyro (no onions add cucumber) for dinner w/ a side of potatoes and pasta salad. Both the gyro and the potatoes were awesome and I would definitely get them again. I probably won't get the pasta salad again. The BF got the grilled chicken dinner with the salad and potatoes and he said everything was tasty and he would order it again. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"***Gluten free friendly*** I'm 80/20 paleo and have Celiac Disease (eating gluten makes me violently ill), so eating out is always an adventure. I was starving last night, and my heart sank when I saw the line at Chipotle. I checked out Taziki's on Yelp, and I'm so glad that I did. With exception to the bread, pita chips, and one particular sauce, everything on Taziki's menu is gluten free. (Yay!!!) I went with the grilled vegetable plate, and it was delicious!! The veggies were spiced and grilled to perfection. I don't know what is in their veggie marinade, but I wish that I did because it was just that good. I took one star off because the price is a bit high and the ordering process could be a bit clearer (you grab a small paper menu just inside the door and order at the counter), but I will definitely be a regular customer. It's hard to find a place to eat both \"clean\" and gluten free, so Taziki's is a gem in my book."}
{"text":"Always love to find a place that knows there way around a gyro. The sides are all very good, and healthier options then the typical \"french fries\" you get elsewhere"}
{"text":"Had 3 lunches here and highly recommend the food. Great taste and friendly service. Always busy every time I go, so that's a good sign too.."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious! Staff was appreciative, helpful and friendly! Would definitely recommend! Had the Greek salad gyro with chicken and cucumber and tomato salad! Yum!! Hubby had veggie gyro and we took a veggie platter to go, both delicious and nice hefty portions!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Taziki sauce was less creamy with more spices (think dill). Not my favorite flavor but a healthier style of Greek food. Cute decor inside."}
{"text":"Not good.  I ordered talipia, was assured it wasn't spicy and came out very spicy.  we also ordered the friday special pasta, asked if it had a lot of balsamic vineger, was told no, and then it was loaded with it.  we turned those in for 2 gyros which were ordinary at best.  came with tasteless rise and way, way overcooked potates. they way they were wrapped made it hard not to eat the paper.  said it came with onions but there were none.  lettuce had brown spots. both came with chips but we didn't know that.   needs work."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my greek salad to go for lunch today. 1st time for everything,  no olives in sight & old iceberg lettuce. $10 bucks.... Later got home & was very annoyed. Tip: check your to go order from here before you leave. Fairly new restaurant but, getting off on the wrong foot. You can clearly see them making your food, so why is the assemblers putting old iceberg on peoples plate?? After pulling out all the old iceberg. ...not much left for $10 bucks. ....got home and added my own olives & banana peppers."}
{"text":"Great food, casual dining atmosphere. They do serve beer and wine and an ice cold beer with a premium gyro is my favorite."}
{"text":"Got my to-go order wrong. Untrained staff.  Food is OK. Usually go to Showmars, they make you feel at home and pay attention to details."}
{"text":"My family had Taziki's for lunch as it's one of the new restaurants in the area we have wanted to try. It wasn't too crowded when we arrived.  Right off the bat there was confusion when we were ordering.  We received a order number,  and my father did too (even though he paid for everything, which made no sense).  This apparently led to our order number being lost.  My dad's food came out almost instantly while my wife, myself, and my 17 month old son waited for about 10 minutes until asking the cashier what happened to our part of the order.  She was extremely sorry and told us our order number was lost and they hadn't made our food.  Obviously we weren't happy as a 17 month old sitting still in a restaurant as others around him eat (and finish) is not the easiest thing to deal with.   We waited for about 10 more minutes and finally talked to the manager.  He apologizes and ends up bringing us food, which obviously isn't ours.  It is the same items but different topping options.  We ate and left.  We were a bit disappointed that a new business obviously failed to meet our expectations the first time we tried and bare minimum effort was made to rectify the situation by management.   It did get a bit busier as we waited,  but I still expect more in that situation.    The food itself was good.  It is what you expect for this type of food.  Very similar quality to Zoes, which I enjoy.  It was just such a disappointing experience, I do not think we will be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly meh. We stopped for to-go today. Probably would have been better if we didn't all get lamb \"gyro\" options. The lamb was... Gamey. And lamb is not game. So probably should have tasted like lamb gyro, not just super pungent lamb chunks. I was trying to stomach the tough, little, unflavorful, over-lamby, under gyroy chunks until I bit into a giant hunk of pure crunchy gristle. I love gyro, guys. And I love lamb. But this was... not great. Unless you ask my dog. She loved it. The place is lovely. Service seemed pretty good. I hope other options are better, but we aren't in the area often, so that's an adventure for someone else."}
{"text":"It's fresh, healthy and delicious. Great compliment to the area. The tatziki dip is to die for."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp and once again the people have it right...a great place for lunch. I had the spicy lamb plate and it was a generous portion served promptly and served hot. Priced right"}
{"text":"Food was tasty and fresh. You order at counter and they bring it to you when ready and clean it up when finished. I had the lamb gyro with tomato cucumber salad. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I've heard about Taziki's from friends back home in Georgia and finally got to try it when I was in Charlotte last week.  It's located right by the Metropolitan shopping center (Target, etc) on S. Kings Dr.  The restaurant is large and inviting and is located in a small strip mall.  The staff at Taziki's were the some of the nicest restaurant employees I've ever met.  We striked conversations and bantered about their pumpkin carving contest.  They all seemed like they liked working at the restaurant!  I wanted something on the healthy side, so I ordered their Greek salad with grilled lamb on top, along with a small bowl of their lemon chicken soup (which comes with rice apparently, but they ran out).  The Greek salad was very fresh and the lamb (3 pieces) were grilled to perfection, though not very seasoned.  The lemon chicken soup had plenty of chicken in it and was actually very lemony and sour, which I liked.  The salad dressing is one of the tastier ones I've had at a chain as well.  Will definitely be grabbing this for dinner very frequently from now on - delicious and healthy salads and soup!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great! My first time having a lamb gyro and it was amazing! The special taziki's sauce I wanted to put on everything! Oh yes and you can't leave without getting some dessert. For my chocolate lovers the best chocolate cake I've had in a while! Anytime I layover in clt I'll be sure to eat here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I really didn't know what to expect, there were a few people in line but it went quickly (order, get number and they bring the food out to you). Side bar; the girl taking orders was very friendly! I got a Greek grilled chicken salad. Veggies were super fresh and chicken was lightly seasoned. The chicken was okay, I didn't really taste the Greek seasoning like I thought I would. I wish there was a side of pita on the salad, the baked pita chip I had was too hard to eat and just blah.  Staff was super friendly and was very attentive to us."}
{"text":"No acknowledgement upon entering this restaurant. I had to take a business call which had me tied up for 10 minutes so I made sure to stand near the door and off to the side. When I finally walked up to the counter the two employees continued to stand there while speaking Spanish to each other. Never once did they ask \"How may I help you?\" Or \"Are you ready to order.\" Just kept talking to one another standing directly in front of me. I actually was interested in trying out there food but based on how inconsiderate and rude the staff were....I went across the parking lot to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"My vegetarian daughter and I went in to have lunch earlier this week. The decor is pleasant and the place was clean. We ordered the hummus appetizer with both crispy and soft pita. We both preferred the soft pita, but the crisp chips were good, too- just not our preference. She ordered a Greek salad, and I got the lamb gyro with side of cucumber and tomato salad. The salad was tasty, with a good homemade dressing. My gyro tasted good, but could have used more tzaziki sauce. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the price- it seemed pricey for the amount of food."}
{"text":"Not really sure how there are so many GREAT reviews for this place considering the food tasted like it had sat out for days.   Ordered a lamb salad that came with some mayo based dressing that was nasty. The lamb was vastly over cooked. The salad was iceberg, so not exactly thrilling. The potatoes that I received were so so.   Since Charlotte has so many other new restaurants popping up I would veer a HARD left away from this joint."}
{"text":"This little gem just opened recently and I can't get enough! The service is amazing, the staff is very friendly, and the food is so good! I especially love the gyros. I've tried a few of the sides so far, and they are also delicious."}
{"text":"We were excited to see they finally opened.  The parking lot is still a mess which makes it tricky to get into due to construction.  That should be temporary.  The decor is bright an inviting.  We were greeted promptly and we picked up a menu at the door.  There are no menu boards, which maintains the clean appearance.  The line moved quickly and the Cashier was friendly.  Our hummus appetizer arrived soon after we sat down.  The soft pita was very good and the hummus was adequate.  There was a lot of it.  The appetizer may be too much for two people as it nearly filled us up.   My wife's salad and my grilled chicken gyro arrived quickly.  I may have missed it on the menu, but the gyro comes with chips and a side.  Had I known I would have ordered the fruit in place of the roast d potatoes.  My gyro had great flavor and a good amount of chicken.  It may have been better with less lettuce or a different order of arranging the toppings.  As it was, each bite pushed the chicken out of the top of the gyro and resulted in a mess.  I would opt for a salad or sandwich next time instead.  We were pleased with the meal and enjoyed the fresh option to the area.  It really is a great option considering the fried competitors in the shopping center.  It will be a great place for a quick tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"This place was, in a word: dank. I had the grilled chicken gyro and the chicken was perfectly cooked. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch for the first time this week. First of all, it's new and the interior is very nice, lots of greens and browns with a open layout and clean look.  You order your food from a cashier up front, take a number, sit down and wait for them to bring it to you.   I love Middle Eastern food and was looking forward to checking out Tazikis. The food is...okay. The menu is somewhat limited and uninspired. They have the usual gyros, hummus and pita and chicken-lemon soup, but not much else in the way of Middle Eastern food. Where's the falafel? Where's the tabouleh salad? Where's the shawarma? Where's the baba ganoush?   I ordered a grilled chicken basil gyro with a side of chicken-lemon soup and a \"fresh side\" of roasted potatoes. They accidentally left the tzatziki sauce off of the gyro. No big deal, but, a little funny given the name of the restaurant. The chicken on the gyro was a little dry and ho hum. The soup had a little too much lemon, but was, otherwise, good.   I also thought it was a bit overpriced. The lunch special for the day was a pasta dish with capers and chicken, but was $10 for a modest lunch portion.   Overall, it was okay, but I'll probably head over to Jasmine Grill on South Blvd, the next time I'm in the mood for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Who ever gives  four or less really has no taste buds. The food was extremely fresh and extremely tasty. I really don't have to say no any more. Just go in and try it. You will love it."}
{"text":"I tried chicken roll up and Thursday special here. The food is amazing and service is quick. The location is great, especially after shopping nearby."}
{"text":"For me, this place was just okay.   I wasn't super hungry so I decided to just try a kid's meal. I ordered the Sneaky Taziki - which is the kid's size version of the chicken roll-up. It comes with chips as a side and a small drink.  I could add whatever toppings I wanted so I just added lettuce, taziki and feta. Meh, it was okay. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.   The chicken could have been a little more seasoned and the whole roll-up was super wet. I guess from the taziki and chicken (who knows) but I'm not a fan of wet bread. So that was a bit of a turn off for me. But I took it to-go so perhaps eating it in the restaurant would have been better.    I'm glad I tried it but I don't see myself running back."}
{"text":"Jacob and I ate here tonight and the food was really good for such fast service. Typically you don't think food prepared that fast also has quality but these gyros were great. I had the grilled veggie and he had the lamb. The sides were good as well. He had the fresh pasta salad and I had the tomato cucumber salad. The food was prepared quickly and the kitchen looked very clean. The bill was just over $20 for both of us which we thought was great. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the runny style of hummus.  The trio is the same hummus with a different dollop of flavoring in the middle of each one.  The grilled chicken gyro is a wet mess.  There are no grill marks on the chicken, it tastes sauteed, and the pita is soggy.  The potato chips thrown in just add insult to injury.  My favorite thing is the side of rice which was cooked correctly and had citrus flavoring.  But not really enough reason to come back when Zoë's is a block away."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place out. I received their mailer (I'm a current resident of the midtown neighborhood) which triggered me to pick up the phone and place a togo order. I called at 8:35pm on Tuesday 12/19/17. The female that answered the phone greeted me and asked me for my order...I couldn't help but notice her sarcastic and corrosive tone. She waited until I completed my order and as she continued to laugh, stating \"haha oppss sorry we're closed.\" And hung the phone up. I followed up with multiple phone calls...no answer, bizarre. I've never experienced this type of behavior, so I'm not sure how I should respond. I just hope this message brings awareness to their establishment, and superior staff."}
{"text":"One of the best grilled Lamb Gyro's I've tried here in Charlotte. Lots of flavor, cooked very well the meat was fresh and tender. Awesome new Mediterranean spot that Charlotte needed.  Located right across the street from Target in the same shopping center of Chipotle and Vitamin Shoppe. They also have craft beer on tap which is a plus!"}
{"text":"The service was great, they even had someone waiting at the entrance to explain where to order, and that they bring your food to you. It's a fast casual style much like Zoe's Kitchen. Good was good not fantastic (sidenote--love the type of ice they use in the drinks). The decor was clean and cozy. Would go back again over Zoe's. Nice healthy option when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I have dined in as well as carried out. I have always been extremely happy with the service and food.   As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the staff. There always appears to be management ensuring it is running smoothly and efficiently.   The food is great and the price is very reasonable. Food comes out quickly and the staff constantly makes sure the customer is happy.   It's great for lunch or dinner, any day of the week. I highly recommend it for a quick order then sit option or for carry out."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like the qdoba or chipotle of Mediterranean food. It's high quality, great prices, and delicious. I've been here about a dozen times and every time the service is great. I'm always greeted and everyone is super friendly. Parking is available out front and also in the garage. My favorite is the chicken gyro with pasta salad."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Really efficient service. Menu and special items easy to find and very affordable !  Food order was fast and check out was easy! The food was ready really fast and it was delicious!  I had the lamb gyro with pasta salad as a side ! Both were very delicious! The sandwich was prepared and wrapped well so it was easy to hold and eat! All the to go utensils and napkins were there so nothing to ask for !  This is definitely a place to go for lunch or dinner !  Two thumbs way up !   Ummpah"}
{"text":"Good food and health great service.  The lamb gyro is the way to go the potatoes could have been better."}
{"text":"I was excited to come to this place, I frequently pass it and it always catches my eye.  That being said, I was pretty disappointed when I went for the first time.  They are kind of like a Zoe's knock-off except not as good and slightly more expensive.  My friend ordered a gyro and it came with chips and fries which was really weird.  The hummus trio came with 3 different types of hummus but none of them were that great.  The original was my favorite but was runny, and the basil could have been good but there was way too much basil and not enough hummus.  I would honestly suggest going to Zoe's across the street even though it gets crowded at lunch time.  I will say that this place does seem to have fresh food, it just wasn't worth the time or money.  Overall the food is not awful but there are better options."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.   I ordered two lamb gyros, and two lamb feasts which came with the option for dressing: balsamic vinaigrette, or Greek dressing. I ordered one with balsamic and the other with Greek dressing, and one extra side of skordalia sauce.   The lamb feasts both came with sides of skordalia sauce, not the dressings I had originally ordered. I could over look this if the food was actually good.   My dad owns a Mediterranean restaurant, and we have friends who own Greek and med restaurants as well and this is by far the worst food I have ever had. The lamb in the gyros, was not lamb. I'm 115% sure they gave us beef gyros, which were completely bland and had zero taste or seasoning. It tasted like it was boiled in water.   The lamb in the lamb feasts we're obviously different from the \"lamb\" in the gyros, but my family found the lamb to have zero flavor as well.   No one finished their food, which left us hungry and incredibly disappointed.  I was excited for this place to open and couldn't wait to try it. It sucks that it's so so so terrible.  Save your money and go elsewhere. You'll regret this poor tasting excuse for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"It's cute.   I parked to get some Chipotle for lunch but figured I'd try this new spot. I remember seeing this place as it was beginning to open and I've been disappointed before by other places offering my beloved chicken gyro but what the hell... I can have Chipotle another day when I forget to bring a lunch.   It's a bit confusing for some I gather because while I pay attention to the sign that's towards the back of the restaurant indicating where orders are placed, there are some who walk right down to the back and stand right next to me rather than behind me waiting to order. They should place some signage near the doors to indicate where to go to order... some people are clueless... or just don't follow directions. Aight... I have a space issue. I don't like people up in my space. There I said it!   As regular as it is, I had to order the chicken gyro. I had to see if it would live up to my beloved chicken gyro from Greek Fiesta in the Raleigh/Durham area and well... it did. yay! I decided on the pasta salad as the lady told me it was a pretty popular side item and I discovered it also comes with some potato chips. the pasta salad was actually pretty good. I'm not down for cold pasta but this worked, especially with a bit of saltiness from the feta. At times there was a bit too much salt from the feta and the dressing. They may want to figure out how to tone that down a bit.   So I took one star off because I get that they're trying to keep it healthy. 'ppreciate it! However, for us fatty folks or people that can splurge on their calories for a moment may appreciate some seasoned fries. Okay okay I'm just trying to turn my meal into what Greek Fiesta offers. I'm tellin you a chicken gyro with some seasoned fries be on point my people. My recommendation is that they throw that in the mix as an optional side item. You really can't go wrong. I bet that would be a great marketing \"tool\" for the younger folks who need a little fat in their lives. (not trying to make it a place for kids to kick it). But I mean you have Baklava and chocolate cakes staring me in the face when I order. Throw some fatty fries up in the mix and let's just go crazy with calories. Okay I'm done.   I'll go back. I don't eat fast food but it may be worth it to drive to Bojangles to get my seasoned fries to go with my gyro.... okay enough about the fries.   They were quick and speedy with my meal. As a new place I hope they keep it up. We all know how some places like to go down hill when they've been in the game for a while."}
{"text":"First time visiting this new restaurant. Friendly service, fresh food in a good portion for the money. Service a little slower than what I'm custom to but worth the wait. Just the right balance of Taziki sauce with chicken and veggies. Definitely will Put this on my lunch options."}
{"text":"Given the immense amount of Mediterranean options in the area, Taziki's left me feeling underwhelmed. The staff was very friendly, but the prices are high for fast food and the food quality was mediocre. This place will do in a pinch, but definitely not going to be a staple for me."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Today I had the lamb over rice with the side salad and let me tell you, it was AMAZING! I couldn't help but to try out their hummus and I'm glad I get it! The customer service was just as good as all the food we ordered. Would definitely recommend to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Delish.  I ordered the grilled lamb with Greek salad and rice.  Rice cooked perfect, lamb was seasoned well and Greek salad was fresh and tasty.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"i was expecting a bit more for the price. Taziki's has standard Mediterranean menu, I ordered the grilled veggie gyro with roasted new potatoes and it was just ok.  Gyro was kinda small and the side was really bland. Glancing at the rest of the menu it seems really over priced for the market. Others restaurants in town served better quality for half the price."}
{"text":"I discovered this place last earlier this summer and loveeeed the food....that is up until today.  Not sure who was behind the grill for lunch (he had on a blue shirt), but this lamb is as tough as a tire.  I ordered the lamb feast a couple of times and rave about it to co-workers and friends.  The lamb feast I ordered today......was not edible and ended up in trash once I got back to work.   Not only was my lamb solid as a rock.......this actually was the smallest pieces I ever received ordering this dish.  Maybe business was slow over holiday so they recooked the lamb.  Not sure but very disappointed.   : ("}
{"text":"This was awful!  It's fairly new and was so filthy dirty I almost couldn't eat there. My dish was the special and was so blah.  My daughters wrap was ok but not great. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"First time here the staff was very helpful in walking me through the menu. I ended up ordering the veggie pita wrap and they allowed me to sub out the sauce since I have an allergy to pesto (tree nuts). The staff even let me sample 3 different sauces. I paired my pita with the pasta salad.   We sat down and our food arrived pretty quickly. The waitresses that brought it to us was very friendly. I didn't know that I would also get potato chips but it also came with plain chips. I liked my pita and my date goes there often and liked his as well. The pasta salad was really great!  It's a cozy place and really a great place to grab lunch. The parking lot is a bit awful due to Chipotle but it bearable. I will definitely be returning to try a few more menu items!"}
{"text":"Thought I pop in for a quick lunch to go. There was a young woman in front of me chatting up the two gentlemen behind the counter. After waiting for 7 minutes I gave up. I was never acknowledged, and I can spend my time and money elsewhere. Which I did.  The shopping center has a Panera Bread with excellent service, a Chick Fil A with excellent service, a McD with excellent service and your choices include a Whole Foods now. Who needs this place and the terrible service. Go elsewhere my friends, go elsewhere.  Even Showmars would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Umm ok let me explain why 2 stars.  Wife and I went to this place for trying a 'new Mediterranean place' and weren't wowed after.  i mean the name has all the words that would draw you in if you are a Mediterranean food lover but their food doesn't have the edge to make you go back.  i don't know probably they are Mediterranean \"influenced\" American joint.  Lesson we learnt is, if we are hungry for Mediterranean we wouldn't go to Taziki's Mediterranean Café.  not that the food is bad, it is alright, decent portions, flavor is almost close, nice ambience and only a little over priced (probably they use organic stuff, I don't know).  so the 2 stars is not because of food, ambience, staff, price or anything but its for not meeting our expectations."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean restaurant. The hummus and also the pimento cheese appetizer was yummy. The pita bread is so soft and fresh. I enjoyed the lamb gyro. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The lamb was juicy and tender. The tomatoes and cucumber side dish was great. I love how convenient this cafe is to my house. There is plenty of parking. There is a large outdoor seating area as well. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It's rare I review chains but I missed this one when  I moved to Charlotte! This place is amazing and I love it! The portions. The taste. Everything on the menu is great and I rarely say that!! As chains go, this place is on point and semi authentic but the flavors are on point and delicious."}
{"text":"First time here and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by extraordinarily friendly staff. Seriously, they were all incredibly hospitable and about as welcoming as I've seen at a restaurant of this type. They have daily specials, and on Mondays it was the Turkey and Egg sandwich, so I went with that. Comes with chips and a side for about $9. I took my order to go and it was about 5-7 minutes before it came out. The sandwich was absolutely delicious - thinly sliced delicious smoked turkey with thinly sliced hard boiled egg, lettuce, tomato and a mayo that tasted homemade on buttery sourdough bread. I'm a bit concerned about how long this place will last because there were only a few people here at dinner time (which is part of the reason for the review) but I'll certainly be back again soon."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were on our way to have lunch at another restaurant in the Metro area and we noticed that Taziki's (which we had been waiting on to open since we noticed it going in about a month ago) had their \"now open\" sign hung up in front of the restaurant. We decided to make a quick change of plans and changed our course to head into Taziki's to try it out. We were really impressed with the inviting decor inside the restaurant and the friendly service that we received from the staff. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Basil-Pesto Gyro (with a side of Taziki sauce) and the fresh pasta salad as my side. Both were delicious! The chicken in the gyro was full of flavor and the taziki sauce was as fresh as it could get. The pasta salad was also quite tasty - not overpowered with some kind of oily dressing (as some restaurants tend to do) and you could really taste the flavors from the herbs, feta, and tomatoes that they used in the pasta salad. My co-workers agreed that we would definitely be making Taziki's one of our regular lunch spots. A nice addition to the Metro area!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Restaurant was mostly empty. Staff were very friendly and attentive but the food was less than mediocre. Namely, the chicken was tougher than jerky. I got the Greek salad add chicken, wife got the chicken roll-ups, both were okay except the chicken was pretty much a chore to eat. I have had beef jerky that's softer than this chicken. The reason? They pre-cook the chicken then re-heat it on the flat top to order. This is never going to result in tasty juicy tender chicken. I can't speak for the other proteins because we only had chicken. Hopefully they aren't pre-cooking and reheating the salmon too!!!  Taziki's, let me know when you start cooking food to order and I'll be back, until then I will avoid you and recommend everyone else does too.  Again, this is no fault of the staff, they were quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Wow - just devoured best lamb pita - ever ! Real deal here ... I had the tomato/ cucumber salad - that was outstanding as well. Only bummer -- this was my first visit - I've been missing out!!! If your sick of Burgers / Mexican for lunch give this place a try - plus its better for you!!!  Probably coming back tomorrow?! Ps - the lamb gyro is ..... Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Terrible food at a decently expensive price. We ordered chicken pita and baba ghanoush. The chicken was very rubbery and included fat that wasn't cut from the meet and the bread was very tough and flavorless. Perhaps we just made bad choices and other items on the menu are more tasty? The ambience is great and I really wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Go here and eat some delicious food and be happy.  I'm going to call my mom and tell her I love her... right after I wipe this taziki off my face."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice new, and I have been very happy. The food is fresh and very good. I have had the lamb feast and the lamb gyro, and both were excellent. My wife had the chicken gyro, and it was also good. The rice side dish is quite good, but my favorite is the potatoes. This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cute new place for delicious food.   I ordered the Greek salad with chicken. I would order again and again! The chicken was flavorful, juicy and tender. Their Greek dressing was very tasty.  Decor was cute. Great casual place to get a quick bite. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in around noon for lunch on a Tuesday, and they were busy but not packed - easy to find a seat, and there were ample tables (booths, tables, and high tops). You order at the counter, take a number, and they bring your meal out when it's ready; however, it didn't feel like fast food... it's a smidgen nicer. Napkins and plasticware are on the tables, and the staff is always coming around to take your trash, check-in, etc.  I'm trying to watch my girlish figure, so no hummus for me (boo hiss), which is why I can't give it 5 stars (I need to know what your hummus tastes like before I start making it rain stars). I got the Taziki's Feast with grilled shrimp, basmati rice, and substituted a fruit cup for the cucumber & tomato salad. The shrimp was perfect, but more surprisingly, the rice was out of this world! It almost had a light lemon taste to it, and I literally ate every single grain. I wish there were more of everything, but that's probably more a knock on my diet than their portions."}
{"text":"The food is great but depending on who is working the service is not. I just left not long ago and when I walked in there was one employee on his cell phone (which is fine) but there was no acknowledgement. After standing there a few moments 2 other employees came out of the back and neither one acknowledged me or asked for my order. Shortly after another customer entered and they immediately acknowledged him. This is the 2nd time this has happened with this restaurant. It disappointing to know that all customers aren't given the same quality service.  I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Visited during the crazy lunch rush. I had the grilled veggie plate and added chicken. Waited a bit for my order to arrive at my table.   Everything was cooked well and tasted great. Loved every bite.  But...I became quite sick a few hours later. It sucked. Not sure why but not a fan of getting sick after eating.  I may visit again...."}
{"text":"I had an incredible Lamb Gyro. I really liked how it was seasoned and highly recommend it. I also had the pasta salad as a side and really liked it. I'm not a baklava connoisseur, but I know what I like and it was a darn good way to complete the meal.  I was very impressed with the customer service. It was Chick-Fil-A level friendliness. Especially considering that I came in accidently two-minutes before closing (didn't know until after they took my order). The manager was also really friendly and I noticed he was really encouraging to his staff, directly telling them in specific ways they were doing a good job.  This is a great drop in place for quick casual or it is nice enough that you could have a mid-week date. I can't wait to come back. The dilemma will be if I try something else or  enjoy that lamb gyro again."}
{"text":"Horrible representation of Greek food. As a matter of fact, it is a disgrace and embarrassing that they would even call this \"Greek\".  I'm Greek and I know what the cuisine should taste like.  The scordalia tasted nothing like scordalia.  The tzatziki was lacking garlic and dill.  The chicken was dry.  I promise you if anyone went on google and tried recipes out it would probably be more authentic than Taziki's.  By the way, you spelled \"Tzatziki\" incorrectly. ;)"}
{"text":"Had the salad gyro with grilled chicken and side of tomato and cucumber salad. It is really good. They give you a lot of chicken plus the potato chips. It is filling. The flavor for me is healthy and taste great."}
{"text":"Per the person working behind the counter's recommendation, I tried the Grilled Veggie Gyro w/ pesto aioli & roasted potatoes.  Delicious, filling, priced well, short wait time for a to go order. Will definitely be going back to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and a colleague brought me their for lunch. It was the best meal I had on this trip. So fresh and tasty. I was able to eat healthy and enjoy my meal! The price and service was great as well. I wish we had one in Houston!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel so uninspired for lunch on the weekend.  I might want a salad, but I'm not in the mood for a sandwich...I don't want to eat fast food, yet I don't want a sit-down restaurant with someone waiting on me...oh and I don't want to stray too far from the Target in midtown because I'm hungry.  So that pretty much leaves me with nothing...until I remembered Taziki's.  When you walk in, you go all the way to the end of the hall where you order at a counter.  The person taking the order was pretty friendly.  When we ordered drinks, they handed it to us already filled with the crushed, chewable ice, which I loved.  They have a small covered patio with about 8-10 tables.  When you pay, they give you a numbered card, so they know what table to bring the food to when serving.  We got a lamb pita with garlic sauce and a greek salad.  Both dishes were pretty good.  Overall, I would say this place is a good alternative if you want something fairly quick, but you don't want a sandwich or something at the drive-thru.  Food is pretty good and basic (can't say \"OMG this is amazing\" but definitely wouldn't say \"Oh this place sucks\").  They have healthy options on the menu, and I think it's a great place to head when you are feeling uninspired by the food choices around you."}
{"text":"I had lunch today I ordered the shrimp plate with rice and Greek salad and I paid $14 for that . to be honest it should not be more than nine dollars for the plate it was a very small portion and not worth $14 the food was OK just a little bit too much spice for my taste. Doubt I would come back any time soon."}
{"text":"They have great clean Mediterranean food! Their hummus is especially good. I would definitely recommend getting either the regular hummus or hummus trio! We also got a gyro and a feast (choose of meat, potatoes or rice, and Greek salad). The gyro was one of the best Gyros in Charlotte and the feast perfect for someone who wants a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great quality food! We will most certainly be back! We left with happy full bellies of yummy food, and smiles on our faces from the lovely staff."}
{"text":"Great little addition to the Charlotte food scene. Above par customer service and delicious Greek food, what more could you ask for? I was really impressed with how smoothly the kitchen was running. Everyone was calm, cool, collected, and popping the food out right on queue. We went right at noon and the line was nearly out the door, but went quick!   Grilled chicken gyro, pasta salad, lamb gyro and the cucumber/tomato salad were all 100% delicious. We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"First time here, though I always wanted to come in because I just love Mediterranean food.  When I first walked in I didn't really understand the setup except for the seating. So when you walk in you just head straight toward the back wall to order. I didn't see the ting signs hanging at first, and the nice man behind the low wall saw me looking around like a lost puppy and directed me to the register to order. There's no signs to look at, or pictures... what you have is the menu that sits in a box to the right, across from the register. I would have completely missed it had he not pointed it out.  Staff is super friendly and  greet everybody coming in. That's a nice but not uncommon touch. I ordered Greek salad with lamb. Everything tastes fresh and nicely seasoned. Lamb was perfectly pink in the middle .salad and tomatoes were nice and crunchy fresh. Tomatoes perfectly ripe. I think the price is fair, and definitely on the same level vs. quantity you'd get at Zoe's Kitchen.  I'll definitely come back, there's too much on the menu to ignore!"}
{"text":"So yeah I was craving a greek salad and I am always eye balling this place when I leave Target so what the hay! Stopped in on a Friday around noon. Not too busy. Maybe 3 couples. The cashier immediately greeted me and asked if I was ready to order. Advised no since this was my first time here. I ordered the greek salad add chicken. My daughter ordered the grilled cheese sandwich. The best thing about this place was the crushable ice. That's a shame. The wait was not so long. We decided to stay and eat. Plenty of napkins at the table. Very clean. Lovely music. Okay my grilled chicken was wrapped in foil and the chicken was a bit tough. I will even add that it tasted like it was a day old. Come on, Day 'Ol Chicken, on a Friday! This is a crime somewhere! I took the chicken back and exchanged for the shrimp. Figure I'd give this place another chance while I'm still here. Several minutes later, I received my shrimp salad.  Shrimp was good (all 7of them).  Oh yeah the grilled cheese was meh! My daughter did not finish her sandwich so I decided to taste it.  Processed cheese. On a Friday! This Must be a crime in at least 4 countries! Fool me can't get fooled again....."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch there. Enjoyed the chicken gyro until I tasted their taziki sauce. To really enjoy a gyro, your sauce has to be on point and theirs didn't do it.  Will keep looking for a place that can do a great gyro and sauce."}
{"text":"Fresh and Fast. I absolutely love their chicken gyro a definite must have. If you are ever in the area make sure you stop in and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Original Visit date 11/16   FOOD - I had the grill Tilapia gyro, potatoes and cookies. The gyro was really good but very messy. Just make sure you get extra napkins. The potatoes were SEASONED JUST RIGHT and had a really good flavor!! The cookies were umm umm GOOD.... well I'm a sweets lover sooo if you EVERY hear me say the dessert is not good BELIEVE IT!!   INSIDE- the area were you order and really tight. If you made a to go order where you stand is really tight and small space. I felt like I was in everyone way. They give Novant Health and CHS discount so bring your badge ."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for my Grilled Shrimp to-go order. Multiple people who ordered after me received their food before I did! When I got home, the salad dressing was missing! Luckily I had red wine vinegar and olive oil or I'd be eating a very dry salad. There were only 6 small shrimps, it was good, but now I wish I had gotten the chicken for more food! Overall, the food was okay, but certainly not worth the $15."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a nice young man. Then a young lady took my order. I had the basil chicken gyro and my husband had the grilled chicken gyro. I came during no rush hour so I was there only customer. The inside is very nice clean and great place to chill and read a book. Love love love the atmosphere. They offer beer and wine but I didn't order any. The pesto sauce was DEeeeeelicous. The \"grilled\" chicken tastes as if it was sitting out for a while because it was NOT hot or freshly Cooked. And why is it called grilled chicken when there are no grill marks?? I would also suggest cutting up the chicken breast into bite size pieces instead of one long strip that I have to chew with my teeth. The pasta salad was good and cold and I only ate a few of the chips. My husband said his gyro was ok but he would not get it again. Next time we will try the lamb, hopefully it is seasoned."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch on a whim after work i had a very good experience here I ordered the Greek salad let me just say it was very good and very filling I also didn't have to wait long for it at all the customer service was some of the best I ever had truly truly there was a gentleman the greeted us handed us menus answered all our questions and took our order he was amazing YOU GOTTA EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say at first hand the service here is great!  Very friendly and attentive!  I ordered the lamb feast plate with a side of basamati rice and Greek salad all very good.  Lamb was not dry compared to a lot of Mediterranean place I've been too.  We also ordered the beef tenderloin plate and lamb gyro and no complaints there.  So glad it's close to work!"}
{"text":"I came as a second option, but should have made it my first. I ordered the grilled veggie plate and side Greek salad with a cookie. I went with a friend and they ordered a veggie gyro with basmati rice. We both were very satisfied with our entrees. We did wait 20 minutes for the food, but everything was fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very fresh, and tasted excellent! Will be back again! We got the hummus to start. Also got a veggie gyro, a Mediterranean salad, and the chicken wraps. Everything came out perfectly. It did take a little bit, but with it being so fresh it is expected!"}
{"text":"Noticed this Mediterranean restaurant during a quick trip into Ulta on my way home from work.  I stopped in to check out the menu and decided to order the beef tenderloin Greek salad.  It was fantastic!  The salad veggies were fresh and plentiful and the dressing was yummy.  The beef itself was tender and not over cooked.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I ate here as part of a private fundraising event that also served as a soft opening.   I had never even heard of Taziki's much less eaten at one. I'd describe it as fast-casual. The food was very good for the price, and the service was really, like reeeeeeally nice. To be clear, we did not have to pay since it was a fundraiser, but the prices were listed on the menu and I would have been glad to pay them.   I had the tilapia feast which was grilled tilapia with a Greek side salad and roasted potatoes. It was pretty tasty. A nice change of pace from the typical fast-casual fanfare. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro which came with his choice of a side and chips. He got the cucumber tomato salad which was surprisingly fresh. We split a piece of baklava and it was good, nothing astounding but still tasty.   They have a selection of wine, and might have beer. I only had water to drink but appreciate having the option to order a glass of wine.   The feel of the place is open and bright. There are large prints of photos which we found out were photographs the founder had taken on his trips to Greece. I like that added touch of personality.   All in all, I don't think I'd frequently go out of my way to eat here simply because it's not conveniently located to me. But if I find myself in the midtown area around lunch or dinner time, this is definitely a place I'd visit again."}
{"text":"I would describe this restaurant as quick and simple mediterranean. I have read some of the reviews that the menu is somewhat limited, but I think that is the trade off for the lower prices and super quick service. I eat here frequently and enjoy their greek salad with chicken. The hummus is also good. The service has always been great.  A bonus is that it's right across from The Met, so you can grab a quick bite to eat while you shop."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food spot!  They will accommodate vegan or vegetarian requests.  My brother ordered a vegan meal and the accommodated him nicely.  The roasted potatoes are legit.  I order grilled shrimp with rice, in hindsight I shouldve ordered the potatoes cause they use basmati rice and I don't care for it too much.  I like parboiled rice.  The hummus was very good as well.  This is a great place for eat healthy.  You have to try their vegan SKordalia sauce!!  It's amazing!  The staff were great as well!"}
{"text":"Greco Fresh is much better...and a fraction of the price. Zeitouni Grill also beats it hands down for a bit higher bill than Greco. We did notice a pasta dish on its way to another table that looked promising, but my lamb gyro was chewy, greasy and flavorless thin-sliced meat, while my wife and daughter's lamb \"feasts\" featured dry and overlooked patties that we suspected were actually beef. Hummus was uninspired.  The staff was attentive and courteous - particularly for fast casual dining - and the indoor and outdoor dining spaces are well-appointed. We may try once more in a few months."}
{"text":"Good food. Not the cheapest option though. But I do believe you get what you pay for. Good service as well for a new place. Everyone is friendly and checks in. Hope this will be the norm even after the newness of the location wears off."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this menu was relatively good! As a cheap college student, it felt a bit expensive. But my mother absolutely loved the lamb, and the large order items look really lovely. The pita chips in my salad were great, so I would love to try the vegetable plate next."}
{"text":"Went with the family to check out the new place in Midtown. We had chicken and lamb gyros and a Greek salad. The food was very good and so was the service.  The place was very nice. We previously ate at one of their restaurants in Charleston and are glad they opened one in Charlotte.  It is a welcome addition to the area and we will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I've been on a Mediterranean kick for the past week and my friend came here and said it was good. Took the boyfriend here and he was excited saying he used to eat this all the time back home. I don't know if it was because it was late or what but the food was underwhelming. I got the chargrilled lamb with basmati rice and salad. The lamb was super dry and had no seasoning whatsoever. There wasn't much rice on my plate but what I tried was fine but needed more salt. The salad which was most of the plate was alright but I've had better Greek dressing that tastes better or even has some taste. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro and said the same about the dryness and flavorless lamb. He said it was really tough and chewy. The service was excellent though."}
{"text":"The food is just about ok and I don't really understand why the portions are so small. I've  tasted better mediterranean food in and around Charlotte. This place doesn't stand a chance in front of any other mediterranean places.  For the portions their serve, I feel it is over priced. The ambience is nothing exceptional. It is a usual takeway/quick eat in kind of dining setting, which works well for regular dinners/"}
{"text":"Decent quick Greek-ish style food. It may be a healthier option for people, but not the environment as they use styrofoam cups and to-go boxes. I hope they seriously consider using one of the many eco-friendlier options."}
{"text":"First time I ate there the food was amazing. Went back a second time and things changed really quick. We were a table of six and it was not busy but it took forever to get our food and after we received our food it seems as if refills were out of the question. We were in more of a hurry to leave since we were there for far too long"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while because of my addiction to chicken gyros. Took me a while to figure out where it actually was but I'm glad I went out of my way to find it! Was the best gyro I've had in Charlotte yet! Plus it's a cute little restaurant you order at the counter and they bring it to your table. I got the Greek salad chicken gyro which comes with your choice of side and chips. Everything was delicious and fresh tasting! I am so picky about chicken and it was fantastic! The service was extremely friendly too. Everyone behind the counter said hi and had a smile on their face. I can't wait to come here again! Perfect place for lunch after a long run on the sugar creek greenway!"}
{"text":"I dreamt about this place until I returned two days later,  And again I wasn't disappointed. The customer service A1. I think \"L\" just runs the place.... I over heard someone else complimenting his customer service and stating it was the reason why she came back one day later. I ordered the steak dinner Fiesta this time and my daughter ordered the Salman dinner Fiesta and she raved over it completely delicious. I'm in love with this awesome food fine."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Taziki's. I've tried almost everything in the menu, and it's all fresh and delicious. My favorite is the grilled shrimp Greek salad. And I always get a side of the chutney aioli to dip my pita bread in. Check it out for a quick and healthy lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Taziki's twice this week. I ordered the Greek Salad Gyro and loved it, both times. I added chicken the second time and it was good, but it didn't really make that much of a difference so I will likely skip it next time. I had basmati rice on my first visit (very good) and roasted new potatoes on my second visit (LOVED them!!). My husband has the chicken pesto gyro and loved it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. It's very clean (including the bathroom, which is awesome). We were craving Greek food after we had gone to another place the day prior. The lamb gyro was delicious. I wish it would have had more tzatziki sauce. My oldest kids loved their chicken gyros. I enjoyed the fruit as a side option and my son scarfed down his roasted potatoes prior to a picture."}
{"text":"I just ate at Taziki's today for the FIFTH time since they have opened, which hasn't been that long (maybe a month?). I've had the lamb and chicken gyros (the marinated and grilled chicken is insanely delicious and reigns supreme over the lamb IMHO), the lemon chicken soup (also delicious!), and their Greek salad. Everything I have had there has been awesome, though as some others have mentioned, the lamb could be a little bit juicier/ more tender. But given everything else, I can't help but give this place 5 stars.  Tonight I picked up a family meal for takeout - $32 for Greek salad, pitas, meat of choice, Tzaztiki sauce, and a side. This was supposed to be for 4 people, but I swear I could've fed 8 easily. The amount of chicken and sides you get is insane. I mean really, I think we could be eating their grilled marinated chicken for the next few days. I'm already planning on using the chicken in other recipes just because there is so much of it left over. And did I mention that it is frickin' delicious? Hot or cold, in a pita or by itself. I love this place and it will likely continue to be a weekly stop for me.  Don't expect fine dining, but I would put this place on par with Panera as far as the ordering experience goes. You walk up to a counter to order and pay, then wait for your food to be delivered or ready for takeout. The service is super-fast - even at the lunchtime rush, I have not waited more than 5-7 minutes from walking in the door to getting my order. Also, beer and wine are served, though I haven't imbibed on that yet during a visit."}
{"text":"Overpriced and oversalted lamb gyros. The cucumber/tomato salad was good. Cool concept. Wish they hadn't forgotten my extra sauce."}
{"text":"Quick Mediterranean food done well  is how I sum up Taziki's Mediterranean. I was really impressed with the speed of the order process and the arrival of my food. It was literally no more than 10 minutes total.   I ordered the Basil Pesto Chicken Gyro with roasted potatoes and got a side of chips also!!!  The flavor was really good for both items and I appreciated that I was able to sub red onions for tomatoes with out a fuss or charge. The roasted potatoes have a good lemon flavor and the pesto was a good consistency. And pesto lovers will really appreciate the taste consistency.   The atmosphere was super chill and the parking lot was empty. It was 5:30pm on a Thursday evening but I was super grateful. The staff was helpful and attentive. The menu offers a variety of options.   I will be definitely be back.   Taziki's Mediterranean 205 S Kings Dr, Ste 100 Charlotte, NC 28204 Thursday December 7, 2017 5:30pm"}
{"text":"Omg they can't get an order right. Gave them another try and the gyros keep getting skimpier and skimpier every time. 3 strips of chicken and fruit cup 1/2 empty. Never going back.  Don't waste your money here. It's too bad because the food is good but they always get orders wrong and portions are tiny."}
{"text":"New place so we thought we'd give it a try.  I love a good gyro but unfortunately these were anything but.  My wife and both ordered lamb gyros.  Mine came without taziki sauce and my wife's came without meat!  WTF?  The lamb was flavorless.  Totally disappointing.  Also pretty pricey at $22 for 2 gyros and water to drink."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Greek salad,  this isn't the place for you. The lettuce tasted fine I guess,  but that was pretty much the whole salad. They really skimp on ingredients here, I got one olive on a $10 salad. The chicken that costs extra was pretty soggy and flavorless.  You can get SO much more for less at any other Mediterranean place around. I'm so mad I wasted $11 here."}
{"text":"Great food, the chicken gyro is what l enjoyed with potatoes and chips with some awesome sweet tea"}
{"text":"Great lunch experience today. A must if your a fan of Mediterranean food. Great selection of Mediterranean dishes. Good for a quick lunch or a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Great menu. Great for a quick lunch or a dinner w the family. Loved he gluten free hummus and the cucumber salad. The lamb was great as well. Def give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The menu has excellent options with plenty of clean & healthy choices available.  Everything tasted great, and the atmosphere is nice.  We sat on the patio and had a really pretty view of Uptown.  The staff is super friendly & although it is an \"order at the counter\" type of place, the staff came and checked on us several times even though we were the only ones outside.  It is a little difficult to turn into the business- there is a median so you have to get to the correct side of the road to get there, but once you're in the lot there is plenty of parking.  Will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The lamb gyro is incredible and so is the salmon salad with freshly grilled salmon. I'm really impressed with this place, wasn't expecting it to be so good and affordable."}
{"text":"Ok so I confess I've only been once and they just opened so I'll try again and re-adjust rating if needed. However that chicken had the consistency of a rubberized jello. The rest of the food was meh as well. On the positive side it's more healthy than most of the chains in waverly shopping center. I would not go out of your way for this med food there are definitely better places around."}
{"text":"We were shopping around the Midtown area and decided to try this place out since it was new. I ended up ordering the Chicken-Roll up and picked the tomato-cucumber salad as my side. The roll up looked very plain (of course their pictures always look great on the menu) but the chicken was surprisingly juicy and paired great with the fresh salsa. I was also quite pleased with the salad.  My girlfriend ordered the Grilled Beef Tender Gyro and got fruit as her side.  The beef was really tender and although it wasn't the best gyro I've had in Charlotte, it was still pretty good.   Overall, I like that it adds more options to the area. It's not a place where I'd recommend  foodies to venture to but if you're in the area and looking for a quick bite that hits the spot, then you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I think I like Taziki's Mediterranean Cafe because they have lamb on the menu. Not that I'm a lamb fan, but that it's different from typical chicken or steak. The service here is adequate. I typically visit on Fridays with a group. It's a good lunch spot. The rice has really nice flavor. Everything that my buddies have eaten looked pretty good too. Long story short, if you want something a little different, give Taziki's a try."}
{"text":"These guys need to know what Mediterranean food tastes like ! This is far away from any Mediterranean food you must have ever had . The tilapia seemed like it was grilled straight out of the freezer .. hard and not tasty .. the salad was insipid and the service was even worse ! Didn't like it at all"}
{"text":"Nice spot for a quick dinner or lunch.   I was in a pinch for dinner one night and had seen Taziki's before but had never been in. I love gyros and mediterranean food, so I thought I'd give it a go. I got the chicken pesto gyro and added a side of Taziki sauce and pasta salad. They were both suprisingly good. The pita was soft and the chicken was well seasoned and moist. The pasta salad was very good.   I called in my order and they had it ready very fast. Everyone I came into contact with was very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"We had a party of four.  This is a diner style restaurant where you stake out a table, check out the menu and then order at the counter.  They being the food to the table and clear after.   We decided to eat on the open patio, which was nice, but flies need to be managed while your eating.  I'm a champ at that skill, so no problem here.    One member of our foursome opted for the lemon chicken soup.  He thought it had slightly too much lemon, but I thought it tasted perfect.  I'm getting it next time we visit.   Two of us ordered the grilled lamb gyro.  I'm used to the pressure cooked lamb seasoned loaf style.  This is a gyro served with slices of 100% lamb.  Nice touch.  I like both types.    The other two members of our party chose the grilled shrimp dish.  The guy who whined about the soup thought the dish was too spicy.  I tasted his shrimp and potatoes and they tasted fantastic.  His opinion has been judged unrealizable!  Three of the four members of our party were thrilled with their meals.  I loved the food.  I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a couple of times at this location. I have also been to the Charleston location before this one opened up.   The staff here have always been pleasant. The food is tasty, but I would recommend sticking to the plates. Today's lamb gyro had good taste, but I was not a fan of the lamb chunks. I'm used to the lamb shaved off of the leg, which to me, makes the overall enjoyment better. I can't complain about the taste though. The seasoning was spot on. The tomato cucumber salad was spot on. I especially like the addition of fennel."}
{"text":"Love the New Tazikis Cafe, my favorite dish is the Grilled Salmon Salad. My fav sandwich is the Pork Loin plus the Take Home Meals are cool especially the Whole Greek Baked Chicken was a hit with my teenagers and the sides were delish..."}
{"text":"Visited tonight with my wife for the first time. We were greeted and treated as though we were regular & loyal customers. Joe (manager?) was a wonderful host and dedicated much time to explain the menu and even provided samples. The food was very fresh, flavorful & plentiful, and the staff was first class. I had the lamb gyro and my wife had the herb roasted pork loin. Aside from wanting to try other dishes, we would definitely get both again. Looking forward to a return visit.  Thanks Joe"}
{"text":"Very, very good clean food. Doesn't taste \"chain-y\" to me, which I can appreciate. Parking is borderline ridiculous. When you walk in, there are paper menus for you to browse with a standing area. When you keep walking you then order at the register. There is only 1 register so be patient and it takes time for the card receipt to print out of you pay with card.   Staff is very friendly and professional. At times, I had resting bitch face while in line and 1 of the cooks joked with me as we began to laugh and I realized that I was just super hangry.   My coworker ordered the chicken breast feast with roasted potatoes. I ordered the Greek salad chicken gyro with a side of fruit and pasta salad (comes with 1 side by default). We also ordered dessert of 1 cookie and chocolate cake and split it. The food was surprisingly delicious and very flavorful. My coworker loved her feast. I really love that the chicken for my gyro was well seasoned. The pasta salad was ALMOST as good as mine- I just needed a few olives in it. The fruit was super fresh.  DON'T SKIP THE DESSERT. I'm so serious.  Price point is perfect. Staff is friendly. They have beer and wine. Ambiance is appropriate for personal or business. Basically, this place is perfect in my book."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the customer service really friendly. A must go place if you wanna eat healthily.  Good food as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent customer service!! Be sure to try the  Penne pasta special!! :)"}
{"text":"The food is fresh..they offer s variety of options. The tilapia sandwich I enjoyed..but had an allergic reaction to it..so no more! The Greek gyro is very flavorful. Staff is friendly..establishment is clean and they offer outdoor seating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.. I'm mixed about this place, really. I've had ok food and good food from here. Service is also a hit or miss. The first time I came here, I ordered the chicken spanakopita and was very disappointed. The dish was super bland and pretty over priced for the portion. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this Wednesday special. They were tiny rolls with a small side of salsa, nothing else.   The second time we decided to dine here. We ordered the chicken feast for takeout and were pleasantly surprised. I thought the salad and house dressing was delicious and fresh. The tzatziki sauce was herbaceous and tangy. It was a lot for us even to split. Well worth the price.   I'd come back, but be careful of what you order and try to avoid the lunch rush."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and the staff are all friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend checking it out!!  The chicken roll ups and the chocolate cake are delicious"}
{"text":"Tazikis was clearly on our go to list since it is right around the corner from our place. Our first and only experience here was a good and bad take on this joint. The sauce was definitely delicious, however we bit into some hard, overcooked chicken in our gyro. Since the chicken was not a consistent, delicious texture it will be quite awhile until we will visit again. I'm really hoping for them to figure out their meat."}
{"text":"Great customer service. But, lacks food quality. Taziki sauce was watered down. The flour tortilla was chewy tasted like a 99cent quality store bought. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I've visited four times since they've opened and My. Food. Was. Delicious. Every. Time. I think it's safe to say I've found a new favorite."}
{"text":"I was really excited about a new restaurant coming to the metro area and when I saw that the new place was a Mediterranean I was even more excited. Looking forward to checking this place out, we dined in late on a Sunday evening after a busy weekend. It wasn't very busy, we walked in and ordered. Sadly, they were out of lamb for their Gyros and were out of the pasta salad. The hostess was apologetic, but i was really craving a lamb Gyro.   We both ordered the grilled chicken Gyros with different sides and the Taziki app.  The customer service was great, the food was just okay in my book. This place reminded me of a Greek version of a Panera.  A lot more of a chain type fast casual place than I was expecting. Not a bad quick, relatively healthy option if you're out and about, but I don't think I will be visiting this place again."}
