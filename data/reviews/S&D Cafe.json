{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. Run by 2 women; Steph and Dee. Located on Forbes across from the Mercy Hospital garage. Daily HOMEMADE everything. Soups, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, desserts. Fresh coffee and homemade sweet tea if you're looking for something besides pop. Prices are reasonable and the food is GREAT! Steph and Dee remember what I like and don't like. Might be a little difficult to find at first as they are not in a storefront. They are located on Forbes between Pride and Stevenson. Look for the red S and D banner hanging off the building. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot! The food is fresh and tasty, and the service is super friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a great option for lunch across the street from UPMC Mercy. Everything is cooked fresh and they don't have a microwave! No zapped foods here! They were open to substitutions and I will come back when I'm at UPMC. It's on the first floor of an office building."}
{"text":"What a nicely hidden gem in the Hill district.  Stephanie and DeAnne are awesome, friendly, and engaging.  I am going to enjoy eating their food and drinking their fabulous coffee!  Stop by and try some of their fresh, local, made from scratch food.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe on the first floor of the Forbes Pride Building at 1425 Forbes Ave. in Pittsburgh.  Serving delicious sandwiches, hot coffee, refreshing ice tea and tasty sweet treats. Friendly owner, nice addition to the building!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for lunch - worth a try! Fresh food made from scratch and great service from the staff. Breakfast choices, lunch sandwiches, salads, etc. I will definitely return for lunch when I am back in the area!"}
