{"text":"Met a new client here for lunch recently.  The service was very good, but slow and they had a problem with the fire alarm that day.  Someone must have ordered theirs extra, extra, extra well done.  Charred does not appeal to me and I almost never order steak as few places do it right. I braved it here however, and they did a rare steak on my caesar salad.  Very nicely prepared and excellent portion sizes.  

My guest enjoyed lobster mac & cheese with his steak, and it looked fabulous.  While lobster mac has been the flavour of the moment in a lot of restaurants, it is worth the strain on your arteries to sample it at Chicago Chophouse.

The wine with lunch was not quite enough, and by the time the alarm was fixed, we weren't the only ones going slightly insane.  But the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Staff were attentive although we struggled with their iPad wine list, which was having some trouble with sold-out wines reappearing. They also gave a presentation on their steak cuts and recommended doneness levels for each one, only to get 4 out of 8 of our orders wrong-- my beef tenderloin was medium instead of very rare as I had requested. 

We had some tasty cocktails, lychee and blueberry iced tea, and the side dishes (lobster mac and cheese, truffle poutine, garlic mashed potatoes) and appetizers (prawns, calamari) were fine. The individual sides were quite large portions and could be shared between a couple of people.

Overall everything was tasty but the experience was drawn out unnecessarily by errors and I'm not sure it was worth the price."}
{"text":"Recently visited this new location and We loved it! We have been waiting years for something to open in this space because we are regular theatre goers, and it is attached to the theatre( don't have to go outside in the winter). The food was tasty and the staff were wonderful! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Be careful taking these reviews seriously, they make their staff write reviews on their own restaurant, kind of defeats the purpose of getting an honest opinion of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Pricey steakhouse, and sometimes that's just what the occasion calls for!  The appetizers are really varied in terms of culinary influences, and look interesting, but I haven't had them so can't comment on execution. The core of the menu is the selection of steaks, which includes both dry-aged prime (top 1%) and AAA. By default they are cooked to order, with a nice steak spice mix. But, if there was a show called Pimp My Steak, it would be filmed here: an extensive selection of sauces (e.g. Bernaise, choco port demi), butters (e.g. truffled, Gorgonzola), and toppings (e.g. foie gras, crab) creates a dizzying array of possibilities. The steaks come a la carte.  There are a number of side options, but I'm partial to the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, which is quite indulgent as I'm pretty sure it's cream-based rather than bechamel-based.  The upshot of all this is that your meal can be mouth-watering, and the final bill can be eye-watering. 

The service is usually very good, with the server ensuring that the meat was cooked as ordered, and promptly getting drinks (there's an electronic menu).  The only execution hiccup was that the peach cocktail did not come garnished with a peach slice...if you give us a fancy multimedia drink menu, you have to live up to it!

The decor is classy: dark, sleek, and clean, in contrast to several old school steakhouses in town.  Not romantic though: I'd say go here with business associates, before a memorable night out with friends, or when entertaining out-of-towners who need to know Calgary is Cowtown, but not backwards.

My only real gear to grind is philosophical: this restaurant touts its commitment to local food. I understand the need to use a major distributor to source prime beef, but the local philosophy behooves them to source their non-prime cuts from a specific ranch (right now they use a Cargill brand).  Even the Ruth's Chris steakhouse chain (which gets almost all its meat from the U.S.) provides Alberta prime and AAA options, so l don't give them a lot of cred on this front."}
{"text":"So, here's another  review about my recent trip to Calgary for Stampede.

Chicago Chophouse is fantastic.  I had the filet mignon with merlot reduction. Everything is a la carte.  We had broccoli with hollandaise, and some very flavourful smashed potatoes.  Creme brulet for dessert, and you're all set.

Our servers were amazing.  Attentive, without being bothersome.

Great tip:

Chicago Chophouse is owned by the same guy who owns Cowboys, the most famous bar/nightclub in Calgary which usually has 4 hour line-ups to get inside (especially during Stampede).  If you go to Chicago Chophouse for dinner, they take you over to Cowboys in a shuttle (a Hummer, thank you very much), and you go through the VIP entrance, and miss the line up all together.  The only way to go!"}
{"text":"Delicious, meat super tender and very knowledgable staff! Also try the duck rillette very special and yummy!"}
{"text":"I had an underwhelming experience at the chop house last night. My partner and I were saving it for our next special occasion. We were celebrating a birthday. 

The service was underwhelming. The food was alright (the tuna tartare was fabulous - the rest was just ok). For the tab of $500 for 4 of us I expect better. In terms of ambians - Earls is better and that is saying something.

I might give it another shot but not any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been in Calgary for 5 months now, and all I can say is that this chophouse has by far the best stake in Calgary.  Everything about this chophouse is brilliant. From service to food to ambience... I would definitely recommend it, and come back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember it.  This spot used to be in my top 3 favorites but that's changed since my last 2 visits.  They didn't have the first whiskey I ordered then didn't have the duck confit even though both were on their current menu.  Most people at the table liked their steaks but 3 people weren't happy (2 steaks 1 chicken) and my dish was barely 3 stars.  I ordered a basil/arugala risotto for a side that came up as mushroom risotto and way undercooked and crunchy. We realized later that the 2 people that weren't happy with their steaks were probably given eachothers steaks as a mistake.  I used to recommend this place for newcomers looking for a solid Alberta steak but I don't think I'll be doing that anymore. For the prices they are charging they need almost everything to be spot on, otherwise it's just not worth it to go back.  My buddy had a $230 bill and sent his steak back to the grill twice to be cooked a little more and instead of comping something minor on his bill (or just cooking him a new steak) just to make him happy, they argued that his food looked fine and now he will never return also.  All in all probably my last time here considering the abundance of good steakhouses in this city."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about Chicago Chophouse. We got a great booth in the back that was really quiet, the waiter was attentive and our food was excellent. The food took some time to get to us, but in the Christmas season that's to be expected. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't bother!

The food was ok at best.  The steak was good but not anywhere close to great - especial for the price. 

But the service was some of the worst I think I have ever received.  I assume this was an exception or that the waiter is on his way to a new job....."}
{"text":"For the price in this restaurant I have had way better.  The waiter was not knowledgeable at all and not at all helpful.  Everything is a la carte and the prices are outrageous.  I don't mind paying a bit more for good food but I didn't find that here.  My steak was a bit on the burnt side on the outside and it was so slow service I didn't feel like sending it back.

Most wines on the list are in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars and they give you attitude about ordering anything on the lower end of about $60. They should have more selection in that range.  I guess it is just a big cash grab as my understanding the higher the price of wine the higher the restaurant markup in most places.  

I will not go back and would not recommend this restaurant.  One great steak restaurant in Calgary is Ruth's Chris, the quality and price is much better there."}
{"text":"Steak was substandard for the price. Especially after waiting over an hour for the food to arrive. The fire alarm went off which might have something to do with the wait but there was little in terms of explanation or compensation (bread would have been nice). 

I had to send my strip loin back as I ordered mid-rare and it came out very rare and blue/cold in the centre.

Oh and the salads are stupid. They're served as full leaves of lettuce which seems more lazy than fancy."}
{"text":"Would have had a 4 if it was better value.  Very good steaks, of the higher quality, good service.  Menu hard to read, and a bit confusing   pricing is out of wack.  It' s not 07 and people want better value, $125 for 3 ala cart steaks?  $20 to $25  BC   Wines for $60......... Seems steep...... But the steaks are great"}
{"text":"Not great. Do not be fooled. Steaks OK nothing amazing. Service SoSo. Windy air conditioning. Bright lights! Too much $ for value, I eat all over USA and Canada. Just a FYI. Maybe it's just our experience but overrated for us. For this price go to Ruths Chris. Usually way better than Chicago Chophouse."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!
An early dinner with a new friend, which is proving hard to find in this new city!
From the wine to the appetizer to the steak to the dessert... Everything was a 10 out of 10...
Oh the service...fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I got a medium steak with fries and it was great! Nice attention and perfect ambiance. It just took more than usual to get our meal, perfect place for a business dinner"}
{"text":"We liked the old location so we thought we would try out their new one. Decorated beautifully and the food was above average but I really wasn't impressed with the service. I thought the staff looked unkempt (nose rings, tattoos, greasy hair). Whatever, call me old fashioned but just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"GORGEOUS space!!!! Seriously very pretty.
I also like that you can access it from indoors beside Theatre Calgary so if you've parked downstairs you don't need your jacket.
The staff brought us an iPad with the wine list, but told us we couldn't actually order from it. WE ordered a bottle of champagne, but as she didn't know how to pop the cork we were then a teaching table.
So they lose a star for not training staff."}
{"text":"We visited Chicago Chophouse last night with the recent Groupon and although it was very good, it wasn't fantastically awesome. I think Vintage takes that title. 

For starters, the beef cut tomato salad was fantastically awesome. I highly recommend it. We ordered oysters as well, and thought it odd that the server did not know what kind they had for the evening, although she was happy to check for us. However the only info she came back with is that they were from Village Bay. She confessed that she had not know that there were different types of oysters. 

Our steak was very good, cooked as ordered and our sides were tasty. The asparagus had a great wood fire taste to it and the fully loaded new potatoes were good. 

The dessert menu sounded really good, but we did not order any.

What affects the star rating mostly for me was small service oriented things that I would expect a fine dining establishment to to; i.e. know what the nightly oysters were, how they would be served, their flavour, their size, etc or when laying out the steak knives, have them pointing the right way. 

All in all, it was a good meal and the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant has two personalities. 
Lunch and dinner. Lunch has all the traits of the typical downtown office rush. Suits and pencil skirts shuffling and shifting as the hour passes. In the evening it changes pace significantly, the hemlines are looser, as well as the s wine pouring.
Lunch can be quite slow, although service here never fails to be less than exceptional, trying to squeeze an hour to get your lunch here is just not possible. It's failed me numerous times. However the apologetic wait staff will keep your wine glass full, so it wont' matter!
Dinner is much better overall.
Both worlds have one thing in common. The spot on food. Steaks are always soft and delicious, and fish is always moist. The sides are enough to share, even though pricey - well worth the money. The upstairs is much more comfortable for me, it's better lit and quieter. Downstairs is where the hustle bustle is, if you want to watch the workings of a fantastic steak house. 
Also love the big gold bull that replicates the one on Wall Street."}
{"text":"This was probably the most unbelievable restaurant I have ever been too! My dinner was absolutely PERFECT. I want to drive back to Calgary just so I can go for dinner again. My steak was done perfectly and was sooo tender and juicy. I also had a side of crab and asparagus. Both of which were outstanding. I tried one of the other girls heirloom tomato salad and just about died and went to heaven it was so good. I am now committed to  the perfection of my balsamic vinaigrette reduction. 

The wine list was on an ipad placed on your table which I thought was super tech-savvy and really quite smart. I split a bottle of the Ehrenfelser with two others and it was just as good as I remember it. The service was impeccable, the bread was warm and I was especially impressed that the server told us how to make the delicious salad! 

To finish off the evening I had a pear Creme Brûlée. IT WAS SO GOOD. It was also quite a bit larger than your average Creme Brûlée and I definitely appreciate that because it is my absolute FAVOURITE dessert.

Basically I want to give this place 6/5 stars. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Came here again with another couple, table for four in the lounge. Still like last time, the restaurant wasn't as busy as I expected. I think it is a downtown Calgary thing. If this restaurant was in a busy city it would be packed! Everything was good, food and drinks but quite expensive. I think it was the drinks. We split the bill at the end and it was over $250 per couple (we drink a lot). The food was yummy. The waitress we had was very knowledgeable and helped us order a bunch of good sides for the table. I am a vegetarian and found good options here.
Will def return :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Cowboy Cut Prime Rib 14oz steak. I was visiting from the US, where we have mostly corn-fed beef. I was working with several IT gents whom we all got drinks and food and dessert. I never eat out for steaks since it's an expensive gamble to find something worthwhile. This is what company expense accounts are for! Also had the sides, mashed potatoes were nothing to write home, the lobster mac and cheese was interesting, the grilled asparagus was okay. Overpriced, but their steak was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food!  I had made the reservation via Open Table.  The restaurant phoned me to confirm my reservation and asked if I would like to sit in the dining area upstairs or in the casual area.  I opted for casual.  I thought that was nice that they phoned to ask.  Good company with good food made for a wonderful lunch.  We ordered the to-die-for calamari!  So tender and succulent!  I hear they marinade it in buttermilk to make it that tender.  

I ordered the lamb shank entree that comes with roasted potatoes and vege.  It was delightful and super tender lamb.  The potatoes were a little much for me and I did leave some behind.  

My friend ordered the special lunch entree of the day and that was the linguini vongole in tomato based sauce with a breaded veal cutlet.  She enjoyed her lunch very much.  

No space for dessert.  All in all, a great place to meet for lunch as the food came on time and we were out in an hour.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here last week for the first time in 11 years.  

Pretty much how I remembered it: expensive a la cart steaks.

However, if you're up for it, they are VERY GOOD steaks.

Service was great, it's a tasteful interior, and I still really enjoyed my dinner.

I had asparagus and a sweet pea risotto for my 'additional' sides.  The asparagus was delicious and cooked to PERFECTION.  The sweat pea risotto, I don't recommend.  Try the lobster mac-and-cheese for a side instead if you want a carb.

You're looking with appetizer, two steaks and a few sides, for two people around $150 and that's without any drinks even (I had ONE drink).

It's an okay place, but I hear that Char-Cut is better."}
{"text":"We has a wine/food pairing dinner there and found the food to be very good. The ahi tuna appetizer was excellent while their ceaser salad has some nice additions to it making it very interesting."}
