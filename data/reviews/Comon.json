{"text":"Definitely the best Korean restaurant I've ever went to even though it's still new. Everything about it is perfect : the food (the portion sizes are huge so be careful when you order !), the staff and even the emplacement (next to station de l'Ã©glise). Would 100% recommend"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Verdun or Montreal for that matter!! If you're afraid of fried chicken please don't come here you won't find what you're looking for as for the rest of you come and enjoy delicious fried chicken."}
{"text":"While driving to Costco, we saw that @comon.restaurant was open for business, in the old Pho Hung spot. So we just had to go and it was their first day open! Bonus!

Everything is 30% off until Saturday May 19, 2018!! 

We had the Korean Fried Chicken with soy and garlic sauce; very crunchy coating. Very tasty! A bit too spicy for me, but I am a lightweight when it comes to heat. We also had the rice ball stuffed in bean curd and the seafood pancake. Kim chi was served on the side. Everything was delicious! Can't wait to try their other dishes. 

Note that the kitchen closes one hour before the restaurant closes."}
{"text":"If you are fan of Korean food you should really visit this place!!  It just opened today and it already became one of my favourite go to Korean restaurant in Montreal! The chicken is so cheap and big and all the foods are so awesome! I couldn't even choose what I want because there's a lot of choices and the prices are fairly cheap for the quantity of each meal. In plus, the place is really cozy!!"}
