{"text":"This is my go to AYCE. I am a huge fan of how they cook their grilled meats. I really like their salmon sashimi. They make my sushi rolls just the way i like them. They can work on their server friendliness and making sure their plates are clean. The only thing I have a real issue with is their music choice. Not all customers are teenagers and want to listen to lame top 40's club music while they eat. Maybe play some classical once in a while."}
{"text":"Can't beat the prices and the salmon is always fresh. The best deal is the lunch AYCE and service is good considering it's always packed. Any mistake I've picked up on is not so fresh avocado (once out of maybe ten times I've been) but they exchanged it without hassle."}
{"text":"Frequently come here for lunch, always satisfied and the price is right. Honestly, this is a better dinner restaurant. More variety and better quality ingredients, worth the extra $$. Be warned there is no tempura shrimp on the all you can eat lunch menu."}
{"text":"I've been a customer since the opening couple of year ago!.. the quality has been going downhill recently...
The servers are rude. We found a little bug in the wasabi when we told our server she looked annoyed about it.
The food quality is going down as well. They have started cutting corners everywhere. The soy sauce is watery. The Sashimi is not fresh and was almost frozen inside.
Overall a bad experience.. I think I need to find a new sushi place near office."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.
Not as great as it was before. They always give you extra(not what you ordered) which is weird. Happens once every trip. They also raised the price to all you can eat and still charge 1$ to all you can drink so it isn't worth it anymore. The waitress are attentive and the food comes out quick. But the taste def went downhill. This used to be my go-to place but not anymore"}
{"text":"Where to begin?

My family and I were a party of five. They seated us right beside the door (with the accompanying cold breezes) when there were other seats available. Let's call that....strike one.

The service was appalling. Wait staff did not make eye contact. Drinks had to be requested more than once. We would signal to staff that we wanted to order more, and they would look at us and walk in the other direction. When we asked what the problem was, we were told they were \"very busy\" when the place was half-empty.

And so I think we have strike two.

The food? Quite possibly the most mediocre pseudo-Japanese cuisine we've encountered in quite some time. For me, the highlight came at the end of the meal when our deep-fried banana arrived and it tasted like old oil with a generous dose of fish and/or shrimp. Having actually lived in east Asia I can at least claim to be somewhat familiar with what authentic Japanese cuisine should taste like, and this wasn't it. 

There are at least four other Japanese restaurants within a block of this place, and I cannot imagine that any of them would be worse."}
{"text":"There are plenty Japanese restaurant on Bloor and I want to try a different restaurant every time. That's why I walked into this place. Disappointed.
Ordered two rolls from the lunch special, avocado salmon and tempura shrimp. The price is fine but the rolls are tasteless. The service was slow. 
However, I saw groups of people enjoying their AYCE lunch. But I don't think with this experience, I would want to recommend friends to come and try again."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst sushi experiences I have ever had.
We got oysters here, which actually tasted like horse manure. I've had oysters all over Toronto and have never tasted anything like this.

They had four employees sleeping on tables towards the back, which made the atmosphere really strange. It's way over priced considering there are tons of sushi options in the Annex.

I usually let things slide, but this restaurant was so bad I had to join Yelp."}
{"text":"The food here is not that great any more. The beef short ribs were over cooked, the chicken tastes different, the miso soup was very watery and tasteless. I think they switched owners because I no longer see the familiar waitresses and sushi chefs. The food has changed too, probably because they switched cooks. I will probably no longer come here. Do they still do delivery here? Because I called a few days ago and their phone was out of service or something."}
{"text":"I went there two weeks ago with a few friends. The staff was very friendly and our order was prepared in a timely fashion. The food was good-ingredients were fresh (I had the vegetarian options)."}
{"text":"First, this restaurant is super dirty!
Second, I waited at the door for almost 5 mins to be seated.
Third, the food is not fresh and delicious.  
Last, one of the staffs, a girl, look like a cashier or manager, keeps yelling at her coworkers. 
I am a little bit stressful by the intense yelling during lunch."}
{"text":"Really inexpensive, fastest service I have ever had at a sushi place and best sashimi I have ever had."}
{"text":"Their food was mediocre at best, and that is, if you receive it. They take over 30 min per dish which is even worse considering that they give you a time limit, for the buffet, before charging you again. They got our orders wrong countless time and even omitted many items we ordered. They charge a lot of money for food that you don't even get. This is one of the worst restaurants i have been to."}
{"text":"I came here twice for the AYCE sushi. I enjoyed it more the first time I was here, and admittedly was starving the first time around. 

The decor is nice with contemporary looking tables and seats; however, the lighting may have been a bit much as my girlfriend was an alien pink hue for the whole dinner. The menu is pretty standard for an AYCE sushi place, and I liked that they have an additional list describing what is in each of the rolls (ex. nice to know what is in an \"arctic roll\"). The food came fast, which was nice and the service was great too. The food was decent, but I've certainly had better AYCE in Toronto (again, I remembered the sushi being better the first time I was here). Quite a large fraction of the rolls we got fell apart in transit to our plates. I did really like the crispy salmon sashimi.

Overall, it's not a bad place for AYCE, but I liked Aji Sai on Queen better."}
{"text":"Went there with two friends of mine and we were so excited to have our first AYCE at Sakura. The food was great. We had fresh sashimi, tasty deep fried shrimp and tofu. However, the service was the worst to be compared with other restaurants. One of the waitresses-the tallest girl, even asked us for a charge of what we could not finish, which was salad. We could not get all what we had ordered. They should improve on their attitude and customer service!"}
{"text":"Consider this review if you are also a \"my friends want AYCE Sushi and I'm going to be eating Udon\" review. My friends were fine with the sushi, but here is my take on everything else.

Chicken Karaage: My always favourite, I felt my $13 was redeemed when I saw it. However, what I got were 5 or 6 tinier than usual chicken nugget style pieces. Didn't taste that great, had my friends finish them.

Chicken Wing: One Drum one Flat, breaded. Can't complain, would've been excited for traditional tebasaki. 

Beef Udon(small plate, similar to Guu portion): Weird pieces of stringy beef, not that tasty. Udon noodles and everything else was fine. 

Gyoza (2 small ones): Totally run of the mill, not much taste involved. Not  incredibly greasy or fried.

I've had better AYCE Sushi-alternatives, if you're in the same boat as me I'd suggest going somewhere else. However, you can make the most coming here (if you have to)"}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp, I like most sushi restaurants, but I felt compelled to tell you how bad Sakura is.  The sushi is terrible the fish is not fresh, the mackerel was very salty.  The tempura tasted like they haven't changed the oil in a year or more, it tasted disgusting.  The creme brûlée was blowtorched and put on our table burning hot with no plate put under it and tasted like shit.  I Like what another person said, that they should call public health on these guys!  If I could give it no stars I would!  If you're in the area try sushi on bloor."}
{"text":"I come here often; great value for both lunch and dinner. Rolls are huge, very filling."}
{"text":"Sushi is expensive but we like Sushi, so we look for cheap yet quality Sushi place, and this one is on top of the list ! As long as you don't expect the bells and whistles"}
{"text":"I loved Sakura for a long time. Past tense.

Servers are friendly, decor is clean. Lunch AYcE is reasonable price.  I was a regular there until I got food poisoning along with my partner. 

It was the worst sickness I've ever experienced in my life. I know Sakura was the cause since the fish was warm that day.  

I would have given it at 5 star, but there's no excuses when it comes to serving raw fish.  Such a shame, what this can do for an otherwise excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"The good:  The $5.99 lunch special at this place has got to be one of the best bargains in town - they fill up your plate with so much sushi, you won't be able to finish it.  I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I have tried, was good, especially the spicy salmon.  You get 10% off your bill if get takeout.

The bad:  your giant plate of delicious sushi will be served to you with all of the charm and commitment to service of a communist-era government store in Romania.   Make sure that you ask for the lunch special menu, it won't be offered, and you might even get a confused look from the waiter when you ask for it.  They really try to push the all-you-can-eat special, but there are better bargains to be had.  And, no amount of flailing or waving from your seat will get the attention of your waiter;  the entire staff of the restaurant has the habit of sitting at a table by the washroom door, eating and chatting.

But overall, it's the bargain of that lunch special that keeps me going back to Sakura, time and time again, service be damned."}
{"text":"I would of rated this higher but something was really off about this place, the service was okay,not the fastest and they did forgot some of our items. But I expected this for an AYCE place at dinner time on a Saturday. The one thing that really bothered me and a few people around us were the little and big flies just constantly buzzing around our food. Most people were swatting them away but that wasn't what made this a one star review, it was the fact that  we saw a big old cockroach crawling out from where the sushi was kept. It was disgusting and straight up nasty seeing that near to raw fish. Everything thing was decent until that. I wouldn't recommend this place until they clean up and have proof of it."}
{"text":"Omg there so good. Better then most sushi places I've eaten at. Especially better then Oyshi. There prices and amount they give u is great. They don't put a crazy amount of rice. I'm definitely coming back I'm so happy I gave this place a try :)"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and prompt. The rolls are small but that's okay as you can try more. There are plenty of sushi places around here so unless you're eating lots of sashimi it might not be worth it for a dinner AYCE."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've eaten a fucking boatload of sushi in Toronto. I've eaten so much damn sushi that I've gotten really picky about. I by no means am a connoisseur of any kind but I know what tastes nice and how sushi is supposed to be prepared. I'll start with the good stuff about Sakura before moving into full fledged rant mode.

We picked Sakura on Bloor for a late AYCE lunch. The dining room was about half full, mostly with students. Decor was lovely, the place was clean, ambiance was calm and comfortable. The staff were not overly friendly, but very attentive and prompt. They have free 'AYCD' pop which is pretty sweet. The good stuff stops there. Abruptly.

Quite literally nothing I actually put in my mouth at that restaurant was worth paying for. The wasabi tasted like a salty mint paste. The ginger was dry, pale and tasteless. The rolls looked like somebody with one fucking hand tried to roll them. The rice on the rolls was so overcooked that it became paste. I ordered something like a \"Red Dragon Roll\" which was supposed to have crab meat, spicy mayo, tempura bits and avocado with salmon on top. Each piece that arrived at the table was misshapen and falling apart, all completely different sizes and leaking all over the plate. The \"Crab Meat\" was a pile of frozen crab, puréed with mayonaise. The tempura was soggy. I can honestly say that I've tasted canned dog food that was a hell of a lot more appetizing than this. 

Sushi making is an art. I'm a blundering idiot when it comes to making sushi which is why I like to pay for somebody else to make it for me. I mean, you're not even really cooking anything, you're just meticulously preparing raw ingredients and assembling them into something beautiful and delicious. When you can't even cook rice properly and feed me something akin to cat food I start to question why I'm paying for this. I didn't finish my rolls because I couldn't get the thought of a bird regurgitating this crap onto my plate out of my head, and of course, had to pay the 4$ fee for not finishing everything. 

I'm pretty annoyed with Sakura. Take the time to assemble your food properly and with a bit of care. Don't be so damn cheap and lazy with your ingredients, and for the love of fuck, buy a proper rice maker. There's like 20 fucking sushi places on Bloor and just about every one of them is better than Sakura."}
{"text":"Whomp. I'm not sure if this place has changed management or what but my last experience there was really disappointing. Again, I really used to enjoy the vegetarian options but last time the tempura was very soggy, the avocado was hard / brown and tasteless, and the side dishes were sloppily handled and not fresh... The restaurant was maybe at most 30% full but we were ignored by staff several times... We needed water, the waitress stared down our table, made eye contact with me and then scuttled away :( We also got our food but didn't have any utensils to eat it with, aha. It seems the wait staff is all new, as well as the chefs... maybe it's just a steep learning curve and things will improve but I don't know if I will risk it to find out."}
{"text":"Ordered through foodora, it was terrible!
Cheap but zero quality, definitely would not recommend.

The salmon was super fishy, I could smell it as I open the container, unagi was also very fishy - which I find very odd... it's frozen fish just need to defrost and warm!!! How can it be so fishy?"}
{"text":"I was here in October with someone out of town. Got the AYCE, upon receiving some kitchen items, I saw something suspicious under the lettuce decoration for the fried scallops.

Lo and behold, I see a cockroach... trying to free itself from some teriyaki sauce. Immediately I felt sick to my stomach, called the staff over and the waitresses' face was super alarmed. And then, two kitchen staff members come out and they're holding it to their faces and yelling at each other... It was the most awkward encounter cause they're just pointing fingers. They offered to let me have my meal (+1) for free -- and if they didn't I wouldn't have accepted to paid for that. I didn't cause a ruckus or bring attention to the table - needless to say, I'm always checking under lettuce decoration/plating now."}
{"text":"For $14 and change after tax, ordered the combo with kimbap, udon & tempura. Received a lettuce roll (pickle, carrot & lettuce rolled with rice in nori), one small shrimp and 5 small pieces of what imitated tempura, and an udon straight out of the package, powdered broth and all. 

I understand that they are trying to lower cost. However, having been in the restaurant business for more than a decade, serving people barely $3 worth of ingredients prepared half-way is no way to run a business. 

Learned my lesson, would rather drive further out in search for better quality food."}
{"text":"Order from here via Foodora. Just got some avo/cucumber rolls and the rice was completely unseasoned, I swear they used someone's unfinished steamed rice to make it. 
I also got veg fried rice but the container was half empty... but bloor is full of disappointing sushi so I should have known better"}
{"text":"The guy on the front is really nice and the food is great!! I went here for the first time yesterday, the fish is fresh and the sushi is delicious. If you're craving sushi but you're in a budget, this is the place to go. Definitely coming here again :)"}
{"text":"Considering this is located in a food court, the sushi is great. rice is soft but holds together well, fish is fresh, veggies are fresh. service was relatively quick, and presentation is very very nice. clean, organized and beautiful presentation. I would definitely come back! price is also reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered about a week ago, very quick delivery.

Everything was fresh tasty and appealing. The hot things were hot the cold things were cold, all was  well. Would definitely order from here again. Nothing was stand out amazing but very solid choice. Good food that was well with the price, and from what I hear it's a reliably good place.  Have to give it a go a few more times before I can say that for myself though."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than terrible food, terrible service.  Even the pop was flat and too syrupy.  Forgot our order, brought us the wrong things, lost our sheet, served me my ice cream before karaage. Barely edible, felt gross the whole day."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch last weekend. While the service was not impressive (being asked to sit next to the washroom) and then delay in service and rudeness and the plates and glasses not being too clean (we let that  fly by thinking its a busy day for them)
In the middle of the meal, we see a MOUSE run around the restaurant. 
We notified the server attending to us, to our surprise, she did not looked surprised at all, and continued as if nothing had showed up. We informed the MANAGER to cancel our order, as the place has an open kitchen and their lack of seriousness for that matter, means the mouse family might just share the place with them and who knows crawl all over the cutlery  and nibble on food at night and probably even all day. 
By then we were nauseous and decided to leave. Even that did not show any signs of  hospitality from the staff and the manager, at the time of paying offered us only 20% discount off the bill.
Now I wasn't in for free food but, i guess this matter required a little more attention and compensation.

I think they are confident due to their location, people are going to show up anyways."}
{"text":"The service from the waiters wasn't too bad. Other than that though the rest of the experience was not good. We had the all you can eat dinner menu and what was served to us was not fresh and tasted awful. Usually i eat a lot of sushi at all you can eat but i didn't even order a second round. It was an expensive round of bad sushi that required us to get more food on the way home"}
{"text":"I have nothing good to say about this place. Went to visit my gf at work a few weeks ago and we were craving sushi after walking around and saw this restaurant. Figured why not give a new place a try since that's what we always do. Never again....

The food is disgusting, very slow and all the fish we got were still partially frozen. The rolls we're all filled with too much rice and it was just a very disappointing experience. Even the service was ridiculously slow. Will never come back again"}
{"text":"FOOD: Definitely good sashimi for an AYCE place! Food comes out pretty quick and their rolls are not half filled with rice which is good. The spicy salmon roll was not spicy AT ALL. 


SERVICE: The worst service EVERRRR. I don't remember seeing the waitress smile once. We went there pretty late after 10 p.m. and I get it's the end of the night and all, but really??? She slammed my ice cream on the table and started taking away plates we were not done with!! To top it off, the fire alarm was on for about 10 minutes straight while we were having our desserts. She just wanted us to leave as soon as we walked in. 

OVERALL: Good food. Bad service. Maybe we just went there on a bad night."}
{"text":"The sushi is awful. It is loaded with rice and almost no fish inside. The rice tasted sour. Probably won't order from here again.


Really disappointed customer.

This place used to be good when it opened 5 years ago. 

It's really gone downhill."}
{"text":"The food is good however the service is not so good.  We found a sticky pad that catches cockroach under our table. It would stuck under my shoe. 

I asked that it would thrown out but they told me to leave it there."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was a bit slow. 

Price is not bad but they seem to have raised the prices. Lunch AYCE (all you can eat) is now $15. 

By mistake I tipped 20% which was more than they deserved. Otherwise fairly typical sushi place. I would come back again but next time I will tip less if they service is slow."}
{"text":"Located inside Greenland supermarket, in the food court.
My review is purely for the sushi!
For the price, and a quick sushi craving, this is your place to go! I will admit, that the sushi is not the best. But you can't beat the price, which is now 6.99 a roll, its decent. You can select from a variety of rolls. Or you can do a combo meal.
Fish was a little dry, and the filling in the roll was a little too mushy for me. Rolls are covered with lots of sauce, so that may or may not be good for you. 
Service takes some time, but I don't think they have much staff as needed. So that didn't bother me too much."}
{"text":"I'll give them a star for being clean, however I never went to the washroom so can't comment on that part of the restaurant.  Another star for a AYCE pricing which is pretty good. Very reasonable on a Saturday night.
The food was average at best. We ordered mostly sashimi. The salmon and butter fish was okay...not the greatest of quality.  The service was mostly friendly and quick.
The overall ambience was average but I really wasn't expecting to much.  We had 10 people there and they fit it all in very well.
This is more like a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Insanely wide and varied menu and very budget friendly. Went for an AYCE with my room-mates and we had a great time. I can't wait to go back there."}
{"text":"Average average average. Only decent for AYCE. Just like every other average AYCE place, they WILL forget your order or even mix them up. We ordered beef and got squid tentacles instead (we ate it out of shock still but hmm). Also limited menu for lunch. 

Sushi is not fresh, but will get you full nonetheless."}
{"text":"Despite the rating we still decided to try this place a few days ago for lunch ayce sushi. Not sure why they are rated this low. The sushi/fish were fine. Had a few different styles of sushi rolls which made it stand out a bit more than other sushi places. Their menu was a bit small but not too overwhelmingly large so decision making was not a problem. Food came out in a timely manner and waiters/waitresses were attentive and polite whenever we needed something.

Overall, I'd revisit again to try their kitchen food a bit more as I'm usually not a fan if I go for ayce sushi. I'd like to see how good their kitchen food is in compared to other sushi places. Decor is nice and comforting to the eye. The space is large enough to fit a decent size of maybe 20-30 people. I don't see why it should get anything lower than a 3 star as it is not worse or superb out of other sushi places I've been to. Try this place out and see what you think!"}
{"text":"Very good ayce, sushi sashimi everything was great. Just that they don't have crab sashimi"}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch with my girlfriend. Disaster from when we stepped in, server forgot our beverages. Servers forgot about the food after two reminders then proceeded to serve incorrect rolls. Other customers whom arrived after us received food first. We waited 45 minutes before receiving any rolls. We will never return again."}
{"text":"I only gotten take out from here 3-4 times and each time the fish was fresh.  Price is decent and the maki rolls are perfect combination of rice and stuffing.  Will order again when I crave sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi but I've been to many AYCE places!!! This is definitely one of the worst ones. 

Pro: The services are amazing! The waitresses kept asking us how we were doing and we got our food very quickly. 

Also, the price is pretty good for an AYCE! And they have a great selection

Con: I thought the places was slightly dirty. Like my cup wasn't perfectly washed and that gross me out a bit. I kinda lost my appetite from this. I don't mind the restaurant not being that clean but I want my plates, cups and utensils to be clean! 

The food was OK to GOOD. Nothing amazing or great about the food. I can't say the texture or the flavour was good. It was just OK. 

I can't recommend this place or say mean things about it! It's just an okay place."}
{"text":"Go Now!

The overall decor of the restaurant was really nice with a very urban vibe. The sushi tasted fresh, some rolls were better then others. The service was above average even for a busy lunch rush. 12.99 is a great price for the quality and the large selection of rolls they had to offer. 

Recommendation; 
The deep fried rolls were not that great. Definitely order the spicy crab and yam rolls from this restaurant they were out of this wold. 

This is a new restaurant and I doubt the 12.99 price point will remain the same for long.  

Go Now!"}
{"text":"I been there last evening with a friend, we ordered for all you can eat.
I noticed that I checked around 17 items on paper but received around 14 of them.
I asked the menu again and selected those items, which wasn't served before.
When asked for cheque, Bill was around $48.00 and we kept $50.00 and kept the rest of change as tip.
The server over there stopped us, and asked for more tip, saying 10% compulsory required.The reaction of server was, as if we didn't paid our Bill amount.We have to forcefully pay  the rest.
I would never like to go back there, poor customer service experience."}
{"text":"Huge menu ! There's something there for everyone and accommodates for vegetarians pretty well. The roll selection is massive but the menu doesn't have a description for each item so it can be confusing when trying to order.  

We ordered udon and it came piping hot to the table, which is also a bonus. Sushi rolls were not too big, not too small, easy to eat."}
{"text":"Let me say this right now: I think all sushi taste the same. When I moved to Toronto five years ago, I thought GOOD sushi was rare and I loved all the sushi places (I came from a small town with 0 to no sushi places). But now that I am so much wiser in the 6ix (and the GTA), sushi tastes the same to me now just because THERE ARE SO MANY FRIGGEN SUSHI JOINTS.  WHY. HOW. PLZ. Or maybe I'm just not a good taster of sushi. I'm not a sushi fan anymore. I don't think I ever REALLY was, but now I know for sure I'm not. I only go to all-you-can-eat sushi because all my friends love it for some reason, and of course, I tag along with them. I can't wait until my Yelp reviews fill up so I can see just exactly how many AYCE sushis I've been to. 

So here's my criteria for a good sushi/AYCE joint: 
1. Price
2. QUALITY OF THEIR NON-SUSHI FOOD ITEMS 
3. Sushi 
4. Other random factors (service, cleanliness, etc.) 

The problem with most AYCE sushi joints is that their NON-SUSHI is NEVER good. Sakura falls short for this exact reason.  

My friends and I got a bunch of non-sushi: mussels (definitely frozen and overcooked, tasted like rubber), I ordered chicken udon noodles (tasted like water and boiled chewy stuff), pad thai (\"Sticky, cold and clumpy,\" my BF said. \"That shit is disgusting. That shit is nasty, dawg.\") Lamb skewers were good though. There was a huge dessert list and it was not too good either. I only ate their green tea ice cream, which is fine, but all of my friends left their desserts uneaten because it was just really questionable. Mango ice cream? Not that good. Strawberry ice cream? Tasted artifical. There was like raspberry mouse, mango mouse, etc, etc. Where and how are the desserts being made and where are they coming from?? Just be wary when ordering the desserts. 

The only reason why Sakura gets a 3 and not a 2 is because of the price. I think Sakura is one of the cheapest AYCEs I've been to. I came here on a Monday night with 6 of my friends and the total bill came to be $23.50 per person (10% off if you pay with cash). AYCE for dinner is always around $30 so I was pleasantly surprised that the meal wasn't too expensive. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. I really liked their shrimp tempura maki and the salmon sushi. But, this fact doesn't really matter because I think all sushi taste the same. 

In the end, it doesn't really matter which sushi place you go to. There is no differentiating factor. They pretty much all get 3 stars from me. 

TLDR: Sakura sounds like a pretty Japanese all-you-can-eat restaurant with cherry blossom petals everywhere. It's not. AYCE is a kind of Asian fast food joint to me now. If you're looking for a cheap way to get full from sushi, this place is for you! Eat all the green tea ice cream and don't order anything else that is NOT sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was really good here, however the place was completely empty. I heard it's under new management so maybe the quality has improved? The AYCE is an amazing price."}
{"text":"Don't let the food court setting fool you, this place has got it goin' on.
A flat $6 for any roll on their menu- and this includes Vegas rolls, Hawaiian rolls, and about twelve other varieties. It's not a crazy-extensive menu, but it's definitely more than Cali, Philly, and shrimp tempura.

Fish is fresh, rolls aren't skimpy, presentation is on par with a stand-alone restaurant even when you order to-go, and the staff is super friendly to boot. They don't mind making tweaks or substitutions, either- I often add lemon, green onion, or garlic ponzu.

Just found my new place for getting takeout: 3 rolls under $20 AND I get to take my pants off and watch Netflix? Done."}
{"text":"Let's make it short and easy to read:

1. Very friendly service comparing to most other Sushi bars
2. All you can eat price is more than fair for the quality of the food
3. All you can eat menu is very good with lots of different items
4. The place is clean and lots of seats available"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. Ordered through skip the dishes and over an hour and 15 minutes later when the guy got to the restaurant to pick up my food they tell him they are closed and no longer making my order.  Verified that someone named Kim confirmed my order and they even called twice to confirm pickup. Skip the dishes even said that they were no longer answering their calls for the order and I called the restaurants mailbox was full. For future reference to Kim and staff - if you are not going to complete an order at least have the decency to not drag it out for over and hour and avoid phone calls. Someone needs to come and train these people on customer service"}
{"text":"Generally disappointed with both food and service.
The Chirashi was below par, made me wonder what this was based off of. Miso soup was also below par, I threw it out. The included salads are terrible, but every Toronto japanese restaurant seems to do this, so even though they are terrible, this is about par for Toronto. To be fair, the quality of the fish was good, but that didn't manage to make this a good experience for me.

I had a delivery order, and I pre-tipped the driver. This is the last time I ever do that, after the driver handed me a mashed up bag, where I bet the restaurant had neatly stacked my food, the driver had carelessly not bothered to keep them flat. 
Would not recommend or eat at again."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy their sushi at all. They really love to fill you up with rice. I could barely taste the fish. And on top of that, the rice was warm/hot which was odd. The ginger was so hard that it was difficult to place on top of my sushi or mix in with the soy sauce. Even though it's cheap, it's not worth it. Go somewhere else along bloor street for sushi."}
{"text":"Our go to sushi place for all you can it during weekdays is this place, with nice space, nice staff, good selection of items and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Fish was freezing and gross like it just came out of the fridge and had been sitting in the fridge for at least 5 weeks. Defiantly not fresh at all, disgusting.
Drinks were served horribly, dirty cups, and the coke tasted like water not actually coke. Horrible.
I would say the service was decent, but sushi is what makes a restaurant great, and this place had the worst sushi on the block. Too expensive for what you get. The California rolls and what not didn't even taste like it, not fresh at all.
I would not recommend this sushi place to anybody, there are dozens of other places to go to and this is not the place you should go."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special, 3 rolls plus miso soup and salad for $11.95+tax. It was ok, the miso was kinda tasteless and the salad was drenched in dressing but the rolls were pretty good and decent size. I got the salmon avocado, the California and the shrimp tempura roll."}
{"text":"I've tried a million AYCE places in the GTA. Sakura is about average. Absolutely nothing stood out. They didn't have any unique dishes. Dinner AYCE selection is standard, with slightly more kitchen items. Their prices are on point. The quality is about the same as other places. No bad incidents on my visit. Service is about what you'd expect from any other AYCE place.

I'd come again if I happen to be in the area and crave AYCE sushi. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"We went there for ayce sushi. Factoring in that they are the few that are opened a bit later than most sushi places, we returned there with a bit of reluctance. The food was edible and crush that sushi cravings but the kitchen food were hit and miss. The only memorable kitchen food was the rock ship (minus the overpowering sweet sauce), the squid tentacles and the skewers. The sushi and sashimi were bearable. However, their service can be left to be desired. The staff aren't very responsive and tend to omit our orders. The serving plates were always dirty (an issue every time we've been there)...and they spoke Mandarin about their patrons, in front of them, thinking they don't understand. They also automatically charged 13% tip on a 5 people table, that irks me a lot as they did not, I feel, earned that amount. Overall, only go there when you are desperate or drunk."}
{"text":"We went to eat this afternoon it's so disappointed. The service is bad and the food tasty is just ok. But the chefs they make order so slowly. It took us about 3 hour to wait and we didn't get the all orders what we made. We just ordered some nigiri sushi. But they couldn't even make it in 3 hours. We cancelled the order and left. So bad to try this restaurant never back."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good place. They're quick too! They have a lot of variety and can do what you want. I always get mine spicey. Both the lady and man are very nice."}
{"text":"Well... I did continue to order from here.. and as the months went by... the food did to. I had to quit em. :'(. It stopped being fresh and yummy and was wilty and fishy time and again. Big sad. Service and delivery did remain generally great though!"}
{"text":"I went to Sakura yesterday evening with a friend. 
We ordered off the a la carte menu, I got the Vegetable Maki Set and she got the Gold Maki Set. Our food came out very quickly and we were both very pleased with our orders. The sushi was fresh and well-made. 
We did not feel rushed and were able to pack up the rest of our meals in take out containers."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for AYCE sushi. It isn't overpriced and has lots of rolls to choose from! Their sashimi is great and if you're not a fan of sashimi, definitely head over at lunch for the very inexpensive price. I like their options of dessert too! I deducted a star because the restaurant isn't as clean as I would hope it to be but the food is good quality. Great place to come with friends but I wouldn't take someone on a date here."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, awful service. My partner and I came here one time and that was enough. Everything we ordered tasted like it had expired months ago. The fish was slimy and smelled bad, the eggplant was slimy and mushy. The only thing I managed to eat was their deep fried milk, which was surprisingly good, and the first and only place I've ever seen have it. The restaurant itself looked pretty, but I'd never go back again."}
{"text":"Got delivery through UberEats. Soggy tempura, low quality chicken for katsu, overly salty miso soup. Sushi was ok. Disappointing dinner. 2 stars for poor food quality and low value to $ spent."}
{"text":"Original attemped to try oyster there. It turns out the oysters I tried in Montreal is still unbeatable. But Bento is great! I ordered salmon teriyaki, and the sushis in the bento tastes nice."}
{"text":"Oh me oh my. This was a disaster.

I've had Japanese before, so I'm fluent in what the line between mediocre and outstanding is. And it's not merely in the food, its the dining experience. Its a collection of stimuli to the senses that produces a complete, authentic sushi experience. So let's talk about this establishment through each of the five senses.

Sight: the restaurant's aesthetic is very pleasing. With modernistic features in the lighting and dark oak wood accent, a definite pro. The food is well presented as well as the cutlery.

Scent: there are no particularly offensive scents, even though we were seated facing the bathroom. There is a mellow dampness to the atmosphere, likely from the constant tea being poured. 

Aural: the constant chatter of other patrons gave the room a very social characteristic. Besides the occasional clunking of plates from the amateur at best wait staff, no binaural botch ups here.
 
Taste: mediocre. Sushi was average but the kitchen items were definitely below standards. That is if you even got to taste the food you ordered. I went with a party of friends, and while our sushi bar orders were fulfilled we received at best a fifth of our kitchen orders. This wouldn't be an issue because we just wouldn't pay for what we weren't served to eat but since we were buffet customers there were no repercussions for the restaurant. They could charge us the same amount while we argued with incoherent wait staff about what we asked for and what we received. After filling out more menus than I can count on one hand, we were still served just enough food to fill one of each of our palms. Completely unacceptable for a buffet which is meant to stuff you until you can't walk. A disgrace to any reputable business, much less a Japanese restaurant.

Touch: it felt alright. The cushions were appropriately soft and created a social environment, especially with neighbouring tables. Though the chairs had no support for the back, something I expect from a restraraunt of this caliber.

To sum up, do not get their buffet. While it may be an alright spot to eat, it is definitely not exceptional nor is it reputable unless you take pictures of what you order, what you received, and accordingly only pay for that much. The kitchen scams you of your order and you have no recourse due to a wait staff which purposefully acts dumb. Would not go again, would not recommend.

Please, do keep in mind,  this is just my opinion. Many reviews here praise the restaurant. I'm only disappointed I didn't get to experience the Sakura many are enjoying on a regular basis. But do you really want to take the chance, hoping you're not thieved of your money or that you actually receive your order? That is your decision - regardless - good luck on your foody journey."}
{"text":"Sakura is one of those restaurants that you will never know is there. The food is delicious and for the price that you pay you get more than enough food. If you are familiar with Benihana or wasabi this is like the both of those but Express. Honestly you can't go wrong with Sakura its very good and the staff is very nice try Sakura today."}
{"text":"I DO NOT recommend this AYCE sushi restaurant. I pretty much called the Toronto public health on them. 

Service is rude And don't even know what the sushi maki rolls are called. They hardly understand what I was asking for. I got serviced tap water then when I ask to change to tea the tea tasted like old tea. While I was eating I noticed two bugs on the ball just crawling away which was so gross. The food came but the salmon didn't look and taste right so I left all the sushi that didn't taste right to me. The food isn't great. The food all taste like it's been left out for a long time or it's just old. I got one bill for 72 dollars then another lady comes up to me and says that their charging me more because we didn't finish the food that tasted not fresh. So I paid. Once I got home I regret I paid at all. I had a stomach ache for 3 hours. I did get food poisoning and so did two of my other friends that dined with me. I called public health and they told me others have complained about food poisoning as well. 

Just don't risk the chance of getting food poisoning."}
{"text":"Just got the 3 roll lunch special (take-out) from Japan Sushi on Sunday afternoon. Got the spicy tuna, spicy salmon and salmon avocado roll: Incredible! Fresh, beautifully assembled and tastes fantastic. Best I've had in the annex bar none!! Exactly what my Sunday hang-over was callin' out for.. Went back yesterday for the 3 roll lunch special and it was delicious again. This place does not disappoint my somewhat-picky palette. Thank you Japan Sushi for making my day twice with this delicious meal! Writing this has inspired me to perhaps go in for a third round today!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab some groceries and this is the second time here to grab sushi rolls already! The rolls are great fora quickpick up for the kiddies with their sushi cravings! The Haedupbap is awesome! It's a sashimi salad that come with a little rice underneath! Will always come back.... The couple that owns this shop is so friendly and welcoming! Thank you Sakura Sushi!"}
{"text":"I was looking for the most normalist item in any of the 6 restaurants there and so I ordered this chicken bowl, with 4 sushi slices. When I saw the sizes of the bowls I was freaking out because I thought the portion was going to be YUDGE. The bowl was big but not the portion thank goodness. To my surprise the food was good. I was expecting a flavor of Yoshinoya/those healthy version bowl alternatives you see at those low budget restaurants. Nah. Not here. 

  Rice was the normal taste you'd get at a Chinese restaurant, chicken was pretty good. Tasted somewhat grilled and fully cooked. (Honestly after eating so much chicken throughout my life I got no idea how to describe it anymore). Broccoli good, carrots good. The sauce and the chicken made it all happen.

  A real surprise was the sushi. It was so fresh and when you bit into it, it would somewhat dissolve in your mouth. I got a sense of it freshly made and the cucumbers inside were fresh too. Whenever you slow down to taste your food you know its good. I was full at the end but wanted to order something else just because it was so good.

  Coming back here tomorrow to try the tempura. Hopefully with same results."}
{"text":"Not good. Soggy vegetable tempura, mediocre vegetable maki platter, average green salad. Would not recommend. Disappointing."}
{"text":"WHY ARENT MORE PEOPLE COMING HERE?!?!

Look, it's in the food court of Greenland Grocery. There's no atmosphere, and as I write this there's a mother off to my 3 o'clock trying to calm her screaming baby because she refuses to give up the \"babaa\".

But here's the thing: Does it taste like food court food? No.  Is it expensive? No. Is it worth coming back again despite the old lady at my 6 o'clock with a rustling bag full of live blue crab? Hell yes."}
{"text":"I like ordering from the menu here rather than going for the \"eat as much as you like\" option. We had the Tokyo boat which is a generous amount of sashimi and sushi for two. The free green tea ice cream is a perfect end to the meal. A great value for money Sushi experience."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to give this place 2 stars because their maki rolls (especially one of their house specials) was so good and my SO loved his bento box and its all a decent price BUT the sashimi did not sit well with me (and I rarely have bad sushi experiences!). 

Hopefully my experience was an anomaly! Because this place isn't bad. Casual but nice sakura trees painted/screens on the walls. I should say - my SO had some maki but no sashimi, and he was FINE. So maybe if you steer clear of the sashimi, you could be okay? Service was OKAY."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the service and appalled by the pork katsu lunch special. 

Everything looked as if it was just thrown into the bento box in a haste. The salad was the least appealing part of my lunch. It was literally just watery lettuce, three slices of cucumbers and some vinaigrette.  There was also a lack of shredded carrots in the salad. I noticed that there were customers who also ordered the lunch special and all of their salads had shredded carrots on them. The gyoza was swimming in oil. The California rolls looked like it was made by someone who has never made sushi before. The only thing saving the pork katsu bento was the pork katsu itself (taste was okay and was crispy). 

Service was almost non-existant. I was told that the oil that the gyoza were swimming in was \"normal\". 

After eating the more appetizing portions of my lunch, I later discovered in the reviews that the restaurant has had problems with cockroaches in their salads...I am so glad that I did not eat the salad! Needless to say, I will not be coming back to Sakura again."}
{"text":"We walked by Sakura Sushi while heading to Koreatown for lunch and decided to give a try since it had a big grand opening signs on the window and the lunch all you can eat price was $14.95. Turns out, its not new at all...

Pretty much nothing great about this place: everything is fried and this includes all items marked as grilled (e.g. grilled mackerel). Quality was not great either, sushi rice had too much vinegar, edamame had too much salt, mussel sake soup was just mussel boiled in water with seaweed.

We did not try any rolls and sticked with the nigiris, which were the only edible things on the menu in my opinion."}
{"text":"I order from this place off uber eats a few times and I've never had an issue.
Considering the chicken katsu bento is $14 and comes with soup, rice, salad, 6 pieces of tempura, 6 pieces of sushi and 3 pieces of sashimi.... I think that's an amazing deal.
Like others said, food isn't to die for, but it's certainly edible and delicious. 

Can say that once one piece of salmon tasted off but thAT's really all the complaints i have"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying spicy salmon on chip (Pringles chip) and it was great

Also recommend salmon and beef tataki, smoked salmon wrap, salmon sashimi, bacon shrimp, deep fried custard bun

Japanese all you can eat dinner for $23 after tax per person was a great deal"}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend and had all-you-can-eat, came with 2 oysters/ each person. Honestly speaking, we think their  items on the menu are a little bit limited,compare to other all-you-can-eat restaurants and also with the price of 20.99 Canadian dollars,  but if you like to eat teppanyaki, this is the place you can go. We love its steak teppanyaki, beef and asparagus teppanyaki, shrimp with basil from the wok.  That will be better if they have grilled shrimp, grilled squid and octopus salad. We ordered takoyaki, which is one of our favorite street food in Asia, they did it wrong.. The rest foods they served are about standard level. If you come here, don't order too many rolls, normally come with 6 rolls for 1 order, they will full you up in 10 mins."}
{"text":"The sushi is nasty. The place smells like shit. I went there yesterday night the waiter took an hour to bring the bill. After going home I felt nausea."}
{"text":"Our group of 13 people came here for lunch on a Saturday at noon. For those of us who chose the AYCE lunch menu and chose to drink soft drinks, it came out to almost $19 when the $1 drink, 13% HST tax and a 13% service charge were all included. A decent deal, considering we stayed there for nearly 3 hours, and most AYCE places have a time limit of 2 hours. 

As expected, and as is with most AYCE places, not all the food we ordered actually came (e.g. our 2 dragon rolls). The food quality was decent, nothing too noteworthy. You can't come to an AYCE sushi place expected top-notch, top quality sushi and fish. For their lunch  price, their selection of food was okay, with a wide variety of sushi rolls, sushi, hand rolls and hot food (no shrimp tempura though). Those of us who chose the dinner menu had more hot foods, and sashimi being the main addition. 

Their dessert menu features fried milk and fried bananas though, so those were a bit interesting."}
{"text":"came here for lunch with a few friends so it was necessary to see how our fellow YELPERS reviewed this place.  A lot of mixed feedback was helpful, but sometimes you just have to take a chance and see for yourself.  
Cute, quaint, felt like I was in a nice lounge, white walls, and changing tube lights along the wall.  The servers were efficient, and kind to us.  
The food, all you can eat for $12.99 is the average lunch price.  They had a wide selection to choose from, however was a bit discouraged they didnt have sashimi salmon available.  It was only avaliable for dinner.  
Nonetheless we stuck mainly to just sushi, their red, black, green, and gold dragons were quite satisfying which was an overall 3.5/5

Calamari was alright, not overly battered like some places, and the portions were sufficient. 3.5/5.
Dessert was a 4/5, my first time having red bean ice cream, and yum! defintely something to try for those who've never had it before.

Would I come back here? or go out of my way to come here? probably not, Toronto has a lot of sushi places to choose from.... Great neighborhood GO-TO-place...."}
{"text":"This place is located inside of Greenland. I always get the sushi bowl which comes with rice and lots of lettuce. For only 8 dollars, you can't really go wrong. Cheap and lots of food. The bowl is big enough to share too!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a late night dinner with my roommates and was so disappointed.
Service was passive aggressive AT BEST for no reason. Restaurant is not clean, feels sticky, and what really killed it for me was finding a RUBBER BAND in my salad. I showed it to a waiter and he said he would give me a discount. Later, a waitress brought us the receipts and she hadn't given any discount. When my roommates brought it up she got upset but went to change the bill and only took off $1...
There are sushi places all around, I would recommend to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"17.99 is not cheap for a lunch AYCE. They didn't even have shrimp tempura or sashimi on the menu. Sushi itself was painfully bland/tasteless. Service typical of an AYCE sushi place. 1 star. Sad!"}
{"text":"LOVE this sushi restaurant! Their all you can eat price for lunch and dinner is super reasonable and their service is great. Sushi is top notch quality and the food comes very quickly. If you're looking for reasonably priced, high quality sushi this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 4 because it really is better than the other all-you-can-eat sushi places nearby. The service is hit or miss - sometimes food comes really quick and sometimes it's slow. Their menu is also pretty huge with some interesting items on their dinner menu like tataki, deep fried milk, stuff from the wok, and deep fried rolls."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor quality food. And I'm only comparing this place to other AYCE sushi places, so the bar is pretty low.

Please don't waste your money and calories. We overheard the other table also say \"this is pretty bad.\""}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars. Probably the worst tasting food I've ever had. I literally threw away my entire order. It was inedible in my opinion. If you want weird msg flavored lo mein and sushi that smells like your ex girlfriend then this is the place for you. If you have any self respect eat literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Lousy food and they totally screwed up our order. We called it in and among the items we ordered were bento boxes. They left out the salad, rice and miso soup. When I called to complain whomever answered said that \"next time you order, we'll fix it\"... ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?????? If you mess up, you fix here and now!!! I am a chef for a 5 star hotel downtown who has won numerous competitions worldwide..I would NEVER treat a customer that way...As I said, food was lousy, tasteless, and I will NEVER EVER order from them again and I will spread the word.. Very poor !!!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday evening and got a spot without a reservation within minutes of walking in. The place was packed. The selection was good and the food came pretty fast. They had some interesting items on the menu like spicy salmon on a pringle chip, salmon sashimi wrapped with cucumber and coriander, baked mussel, and fried milk. The service could have been a bit better. They were really busy so we didn't get our tea filled unless we kept asking. 

The price was $21 per person. The bill came to $54 for 2 people including tax and tip.

Overall, an average sushi place. Hit the spot for my sushi craving. Would go back."}
{"text":"I'M PRETTY PICKY when it comes to food, and in PARTICULAR sashimi - you can tell when its NOT fresh and I refuuuuuuse to pay for old fish -that is not any food should be served; if the sashimi is not good the second time around there is SLIVER of chance for me returning. 

We entered here because AJI SAI was too far and I was starved which makes reasoning hard and grumpy- well I didn't stay that way long. 

An incredibly funny thing: on the all you can eat menu under sashimi? - it says \"cocked egg\" lmao I peed myself laughing on that one.

I will say the one downside was that the staff didn't really speak English well and they weren't all that interactive but, they were super patient and tried to communicate. The service was very good. The food was very good - they even remembered that I don't like octopus and never included in future orders and the portion was just right for two people. Did I mention that the fish was very good? Well, it was, in case I forgot.

DOWNSIDE:
I REALLY WISH I HADN'T STUFFED MY FACE AND LEFT SOME ROOM FOR DESSERT, and that I would learn one day to NOT go for all you can eat."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the one time I went for lunch with my family. The first thing i noticed was the modern-fancy decor. The lunch specials were so very cheap at $6-8 for most options. They were fresh and very satisfying and came with soup and salad. I also noticed they had what looked to be a nice selection for AYCE for a reasonable $12/13. I would definitely come back here to switch it up and it has been added into my rotation of lunching restaurants."}
{"text":"It's my Monday tradition to come here for lunch. This place is amazing. The food court itself looks pretty sketchy but the sushi from this place is fresh, good priced, and delicious. The people that work there are very nice and courteous. They go above and beyond. I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My wife had a very bad experience a couple of days ago, so she told me today \"you better update that review!\" 
So, she was at the restaurant with some friends, and when they were done, they had 8 pieces of imitation crab sashimi leftover that they just couldn't finish. The waitress charged them $15 for the extra food (they were having AYCE), and my wife and her friends were not happy about this at all. For one thing, it's a small amount of food, but it was also just imitation crab pieces, and they charged them $15 extra?! So they argued with the waitress about this, but she just wouldn't budge, and was really unfriendly. Finally, they decided they just wouldn't tip the waitress, but later found that 15% had been added to their total bill without them asking! 
So my wife and her friends left all angry and everything. She's really angry because she's a very regular customer, and she basically got treated like crap for 8 pieces of fake crab, and now she says she refuses to go there ever again. They lost a regular customer for 8 pieces of crab..."}
{"text":"I would have given 0 stars if possible. This place needs to shut down. It's extremely unsanitary.  I went a week ago and was charged 60$ for 2 all you can eat and waitress added all you can drink without asking. Upon arriving, when asked for a table for two, she stayed silent and gave a dirty/confused look as if I had two heads. She finally showed us to our seats. The cups weren't washed properly. 
The soda was stale and warm.
The food was soggy and the fish looked like it had gone bad.
The presentation and placement of the food was embarrassing. We didn't even get half the food we ordered. We even received food we didn't order. On an extremely hot day, they didn't have AC running. Chefs didn't have hair nets on. You could only imagine how sweaty they get while making your food. I seen reviews of this place AFTER GOING... bad mistake, I should have checked FIRST. 
People reported seeing cockroaches under the table too. Completely nasty and unsanitary. Don't waste your money here. I wanted to leave, asked for the bill it was 60$ +... for low quality service, food, and the place was dirty (infestation of pests). We only ordered 4 rolls, edamame and 2 drinks... we just wanted to get out of there. They didn't lower the price of the bill and they are ridiculously confident to over charge for disgusting and unacceptable quality. New Generation on Bloor (AYCE) is 55$ for two plus drinks and better than average. Never complained at that place. Again, don't waste your money here. The waitress didn't consider how unsatisfied and unimpressed we were on the service and still charged high price for low quality. Worst sushi place I've ever been to. No excuses. Why are they still open for business when they cannot comply with restaurant regulations?"}
{"text":"Sushi always fresh. Fast friendly service. GREAT price. My favorite sushi spot by far."}
{"text":"Ordered dynamite roll, tasted awful, ingredients were not fresh, presentation was off. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Location: great location in the Annex

Service: prompt. 

Food: delicious!
Great portion for the price. 
I went for dinner and ordered a salmon bento box $10.95   

It's a pretty large portion and delicious. 

The selection for the all you can eat dinner is far better than most places I've been. 

This place constantly has customers of all groups so it not just the university students. 

I will continue to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my sister. 
It's 13.99 for the all you can eat. I find it a good spot. The rolls are very interesting, they have a lot of variety. I loved the Philadelphia rolls! Try also the wok stuff. The udons were good. Not to mention that the food came fast! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were just trying out sushi places on Bloor and this was the second shop to try and honestly it's worth it. Lunch is literally $16 w/ tax and dinner is around $23. Fast paced, even when it's really busy during evenings and night. The food is absolutely amazing, tastes great compared to other places and they have the sweetest people working there. Although it's a little small but the overall feel of the place makes you feel comfortable. I still come here, either weekly or once a month and I bring more of my friends each time. Totally recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a grocery store food court.  Prices are CHEAP!! And all I can say was the crunchy spicy tuna was amazing!!! Service is good and very friendly.  If ur in a rush, and don't need all the frills....this is it."}
{"text":"The prices are good and affordable, not expensive as some sushi places I've been to. The lunch special is pretty good. They have bento box special for $6.95 during the week. Good portion for the bento nox.

The service is OK. Don't expect exceptional service here."}
{"text":"2.5/3.0. Definitely a mediocre AYCE sushi location. The food was average, and the service was not the greatest. We had to ask a few times for items, it was not busy at all when we went... otherwise, I could easily understand why the forgot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  The price is great.

3 maki rolls with soup and salad for approximately $10 after tax?  Can't beat that.  I had the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and dynamite.  Not the greatest rolls I've tasted, but again for the price, well worth it.  Also, the rolls were very large, with lots of fish (not all rice, like some other places).

The servers were very friendly and attentive.  Lots of water refills, and available for any questions.  I've been to too many sushi places where the staff look like they want to shoot themselves, and tend to take it out on the customers with bad service.  This is definitely not one of those.

Food 3.5/5 (Avocado could be a bit fresher.  'Twas a tad too mushy)
Service 5/5
Value 5/5
Decor/atmosphere 4/5 (really nice mural painted on the wall & classical music radio)
Overall 4/5

Would recommend.  Check it out."}
{"text":"The food is okay... not the worst ayce sushi I've had... but it's not even close to the better ones out there. I do enjoy the +$1 for unlimited pop. There was a sign outside that advertised oysters with the ayce... but they were \"sold out\" when we were there and it was only 6:30 pm. I wasn't happy with that. The service is not the greatest here... the servers walk so quickly that it's very difficult to get their attention and they do not know what tables they are serving the food to. The food is seriously mediocre, I do not like giant pieces of salmon sashimi nor do I like warm rice in my sushi. The cooked food might be even worse than the sushi. Typically from my experience, cooked food at ayce sushi restaurants is a safe choice even if the sushi part is not so good but there are no highlights here."}
{"text":"Sakura is average when it comes to its regularly cooked dishes. What's worth trying is the fried food - absolutely delicious! I also recommend the gyoza.
It's definitely not a posh restaurant, I like the relaxed, quirky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love their all you can eat dinner, but lunch doesn't offer salmon sashimi which is rather disappointing  $12.99 for lunch and $19.99 for dinner.
Their dragons are quite satisfying and portions are sufficient. Sushi is always fresh, and well prepared!
Service is nice and friendly. Good ice cream!
It tends to get very cold there, so that is quite unfortunate. Not a good drink selection, but I guess this is regular for sushi places. 
Overall a nice place to go if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is horrible with managing time and taking orders. I ordered my food @11:57 and got there at 12:15. They didn't even have my order completed. They tell me it'll be 5 more minutes. When I ended up waiting another 25 minutes. The rest of my food was cold cause it had been sitting. I will not waste my money with them again!"}
{"text":"As an all you-can-eat place, Sakura offers more than I would expect. Hamachi sushi was offered on the menu which is really rare. All the other fish is very fresh. The proportion between rice and fish on the sushi was exactly right. I live the salmon on the chip. Tasty, crispy and fun. Have to try."}
{"text":"Very low quality sushi, I don't think I've ever had worse sushi in all of Toronto and that's not an exaggeration (grocery store sushi was better than what I was served earlier today). Definitely didn't expect anything fancy with this being a buffet, but the sushi rolls were 80% rice which was mushed together and flavourless. Even the miso soup was very watered down. To top it off I got food poisoning, which looking back should have been expected after eating at a place like this. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"This place is probably my soymate for best sushi lunch in Toronto!

At $7 for 2 rolls or a bento and $9 for 3 rolls, this place is a steal!!! Not only is the food cheap, but it's good too! Personally recommend the Sakura and Crunchy roll as they seem to be staples of the restaurant. The Miso soup could definitely be better and tends to be a bit bland, however the salad is dressed fairly well and more than makes up for the soup!

The staff are friendly and you can tell they try really hard, but just seem to be not present while taking your order and/or tend to forget items from the ayce list that you've ordered.

If you're going for dinner ayce, make sure you get the spider, angel roll and creme brulee for dessert! Trust me on this one. 

All in all, easily one of my favourite sushi places in downtown toronto and near the UofT Campus."}
{"text":"Great selection for dinner. It gets busy real quick over weekends. Service is quick but do mix up the AYCE dishes sometimes."}
{"text":"Very bland food, ok service. We went for ayce lunch and understand the difference in quality but definitely had better ayce sushi around the city."}
{"text":"Came here once during the summer. Never coming back here again.

Price is at the same level as New Gen but food is definitely subpar to New Gen.

Chicken teriyaki was burnt, miso soup not to my taste, salad was even crappier than New Gen's (which is hard to do, actually), and sushi portions were tiny."}
{"text":"Absolute thrashery. This used to be my go to place for sushi and rolls but this time the eel roll and pork katsu that my partner and I ordered was just a sheer disappointment. They tasted like frozen food straight from the fridge at loblaw. The service was also poor. There are plenty of other Japanese places along bloor street and I would advise anyone who are planning to visit this place to just pass through and walk a bit more to find a better place."}
{"text":"So disappointing. I have not been this upset about poor food/poor service before. I used to like their all you can eat lunch, but this time the eel dragon roll I tried today was by far the WORST sushi roll I've ever had in my life. Eel don't even look fresh, it's rather disgusting looking. It doesn't taste right either. Service was poor and clumsy in general. I'm NEVER returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"For a Japanese AYCE restaurant, Sakura has a pretty good menu selection to choose from with quick service and decent dinner pricing.

The sashimi and sushi is nothing to write home about but you get your money's worth. They do have some special maki rolls, including some that had torched salmon which had a good smoky flavour paired with a spicy mayo dressing. The teriyaki and grilled items from the kitchen were seasoned really well and the lamb skewers were a highlight. Don't try the beef udon though, as the beef was thick and super mushy and was not the thinly sliced beef that's usually used in the broth noodles.

Presentation js not a top priority but if you're looking for a slightly above average AYCE sushi place that is affordable, then definitely give Sakura a try!"}
{"text":"I expected the sushi to be good from the other reviews, but i wasn't prepared for it to be as good as it was. This place is super close to my house and i am fully ready to eat here once a week now."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and usually pick this spot because of the variety in their dinner menu.  Their dinner menu is definitely much better than the lunch menu,  which is a little lacking. The food itself is good;  everything tastes fresh and is of decent quality. They also seem to have a more extensive kitchen menu than most other places. 

The service could be better. While the servers are not outright rude they are not very attentive and on more than one occasion have avoided eye contact and were difficult to flag down. A lot of the time we don't receive everything we order and have had to re - order it as a result,  although this is usually when it is busy. 

All in all the food is good and inexpensive for its variety."}
{"text":"I love going to Sakura ! Just hearing the name mentioned makes me drool. Their sushi is fresh and creative and during the lunch buffet ($12.99) is a steal! 

The service is very low key but not much is required of a buffet lunch so I'm not complaining. Can't wait for the next excuse to go!"}
{"text":"Solid AYCE for both lunch and dinner.  Were cool with leaving out avocado for me, and didn't forget on subsequent orders, which is a HUGE plus for me.  Avocado makes me sick to my stomach, but I LOVE sushi, so when a place is willing and happy to cater to my funny little request, I really appreciate it.

Service was a little slow, but I'll blame that on it being busy and a little new, so they're still getting into their groove.  I don't think any of us minded waiting a few extra minutes.

Fish was definitely above average for the price, and the rolls held together really well.  HATE when the rolls fall apart on you, but no such worry here!

Cooked dishes were equally yummy.  Only real problem is the lack of vegetarian options.  Makes it hard to bring my veggie friends here.

Overall, definitely more than satisfied.  Have been back twice and would happily go again.  Great for nights when you just really need some nice sushi for a price that won't totally break the bank."}
{"text":"*fyi* it's in the grocery store
If your looking for this place it's tucked away right inside the Korean grocery store.  I loved the food.  I had the tempura cali roll and the medium spicy ramen (wasn't very spicy, which I liked).  Pretty good pricing.  They have some combos with a roll and ramen.  I just wish they offered an option to upgrade your roll with the ramen combo.  Totally fresh tasty food though."}
{"text":"Presentation was amazing!  This monster poke dish was only $12 so the value equation is definitely there too. The textures and flavors were wonder and everything was very fresh!  Loved it.  My favorite part was the little fish eggs! Glad we stopped here on our trio through Vegas!"}
{"text":"After being shocked at the exhorbitant prices at Benihana and other Asian cuisine on the Vegas strip, my friend and I ventured less than 10 minutes and found Sakura.  The most satisfying meals at unbeliever prices! My friend ordered sashimi topped rice salad (hwoidopbab) and i ordered crunch spicy tuna. The meals were quick, came with miso and marinated jalapenos. I enjoyed the fried rice noodle on top of my roll, completely filling me up. Less than $20 for all this food! Even in LA this would be a good deal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good chicken bowl combo with half a cali roll and soup for less than seven dollar bills?  Sold.  We both got the combo.  It was very good for what we paid.  That will surely be my go-to order whenever we have dinner at the food court."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. Sashimi always fresh and generous. We always get delivery.
Only 3 stars because  delivery takes up to 2 hours which is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The thing I like about Sakura is that (for most rolls) they don't weigh them down with rice! The sashimi is always fresh and beautifully presented. 

They have decent selection, and most of the rolls are very good. The general Tao's chicken is too sweet, but most other dishes are nicely done. The sushi is what matters, and that's what they do well. 

The service is good overall. Some of the servers are excellent, some are ok. 

The red bean ice cream used to be awesome, but tonight it tasted like they bought strawberry ice cream and added in beans for appearance a priori... it tasted good, but it wasn't real red bean ice cream - that is for sure. 

The plates are always presented nicely, and the food comes out pretty fast - even on busy nights!"}
{"text":"Immediately I was kindly greeted by a Japanese waitress and we were seated in comfy chairs. The decor was quite nice compared to the neighbouring sushi places, and although the restaurant could've been better lit, the lux lighting on the wall was a nice touch and I felt very comfortable and relaxed. Now on to the food (Sorry, no pictures):

The menu was nothing I've ever seen before in terms of item selection for an all-you-can-eat sushi place. So, we ordered beef galbi short ribs, beef tataki (thin raw beef in vinegar), baked mussels (thousand island dressing + mayo), avocado salad, seaweed salad, mussel soup, salmon, surf crab, mackerel and snapper sashimi, yakitori (chicken skewers), chicken karaage, and spicy tuna roll on our first order. I was surprised to see that the roll had a thin layer of rice and a fairly generous amount of fish. All the portions were generous, clean tasting, fresh and yummy. The galbi short ribs were, by far, the best dish we ordered. The meat was juicy, fatty and made us crave for more. And so we did. The sashimi was beautifully plated and looked delicious, and oh, did I mention it tasted great, too? The dessert had a nice selection of creme brule, deep fried banana, red bean ice cream, mango pudding, mango ice cream and more (regrettably, we didn't order the green tea ice cream). We basically ordered it all and they were all delectable.

After gaining 5 pounds in one sitting, I didn't feel tired nor hated myself for enduring such a gluttonous feast. In fact, we went for more galbi ribs and salmon sashimi after the dessert because we caught a second wind, or it was just that damn good (or we're fatasses trying to get our money's worth). Overall, the service was excellent; our cups were always filled with water and the food came out fast and fresh. The servers were genuinely kind and frequently smiled at us :) 

For $21.95, you simply can't beat the price for the quality and the selection of dishes you can order. I'd definitely come back here again if there weren't a million other restaurants to try out in Toronto during my limited stay here. 

Thanks for reading my review,

Seasoned sushi eater visiting from Vancouver, BC."}
{"text":"Okay, this isn't your fancy sushi but it definitely satisfies a craving when you are just wanting to do take out and veg out at home.  They have a variety of rolls for $6.99 each and they are reasonably sized.  This is equivalent to sushi from Smith's BUT cheaper, bigger in size, and better options for combos.  Honestly, the rolls taste better than they look....  We've ordered to go from here twice and my favorites so far are the double shrimp roll and the baked salmon roll.  Can't complain since the price is right and it is definitely convenient."}
{"text":"OK - NOW I understand the negative reviews.  This place is REALLY starting to PEEVE me off!!!!

On the positive side, most of the people working there are smart (call me racist, but most of them seem to Japanese, and they seem on the ball and simply significantly smarter than your average restaurant employee.)

BUT - but - but some of the employees have difficulty speaking English, and when I call in my order for delivery it is a BIG struggle sometimes to get myself understood.  I'm often tempted to ask in exasperation - JUST PUT SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS DECENT ENGLISH ON THE PHONE!

I've been ordering deliver from this place pretty often - and I've been starting to get pretty irritated by a number of issues.

First - variation is preparation of dishes.  One of my recent orders of Kani Salad (crab salad) (which is very nice there - and is a serving of crab on top of probably sliced cucumber) - but a recent order of 2 Kani salads came with the crab MIXED IN with the cucumber!  Now I don't know if the chef is new, or if they were running out of crab, and he tried to hide the small amount of crab by mixing it with the greens - but this preparation was NOT nearly as enjoyable.

And their delivery person is (rare), and pleasant girl.  But she really bugged me recently, when on a small delivery (for one person), she HAD NO CHANGE.  Now I'm not sure how much everybody tips, but isn't $5.00 tip on a small order reasonably fair?  But because she had no change, (and I didn't have small bills), she ends up with a $10 tip.  (Now she said she would give me back $4.00 the next time I delivered, and she did remember - but isn't having change PART OF THE ESSENTIALS of being a delivery person?)

And I'm bugged by other variations in preparation.  I LOVE beef short ribs - and I usually order two beef short rib appetisers - but they USUALLY either overcook them OR undercook them.  It's different almost every time.  (Now - granted - it's probably not easy to get the cooking time perfect on these ribs:  they go from very soft and with an 'uncooked texture' to dry and hard and overcooked with not too much extra cooking time.  I guess it is an art to get the grill time just right to make them firm, but not dried out and tough.)

On the good side - their shrimp tempura is a good deal for 5 big shrimp - but the 2nd last time I ordered I got a small plastic container of tempura sauce - WITH ONLY HALF AN INCH DEEP SERVING of tempura sauce.  That is NOT enough tempura sauce for even 3 shrimp - let alone 5.

And last night, when I ordered two orders of shrimp tempura, the idiots put the shrimp on the BOTTOM of the bag, and the order arrived after 1 hour and 6 minutes - COLD - and the tempura sauce has spilled - IN BOTH SERVINGS OF SHRIMP.  Would you want to eat cold shrimp tempura that had been sitting soaking up tempura sauce for an hour?  Me neither - so I call, peeved, and the manager says she will credit me ONE shrimp on my next order.  SORRY - that is NOT good enough.

So they were nice enough send out 2 new shrimp tempura - but of course, by the time it arrives, I've eaten ALL of the rest of my meal, and I'm pretty much full, and then the only thing I have to eat is shrimp - and I don't know if you are like me - but a meal is MUCH better if you eat a few bites of one thing, and then a few bites of another, and then another, and then go back to the original dish.  Do you know what I mean?  That 'cleansing of the palate' makes the variety of dishes more enjoyable - but when the ONLY thing I had was 10 shrimp to eat all at once - well, after 3 I was getting that 'sick' feeling I've found I usually get if I order two orders of shrimp tempura.

So now I've got 7 soggy pieces of shrimp Tempura in my fridge.  I wonder if I should reheat them later in the toaster oven, or try dropping them in my deep fryer.  I know that if I put them in the microwave they will be a soggy DISASTER.

So NOW I know why people complain about this place.  I don't know if it's because they were busy.  Maybe they were busy last night -  because the first three times I called for delivery the phone went to voicemail - and don't you just HATE it when you get the message \"this voicemail has not been set up yet\"?

So I have to say - this place has USUALLY disappointed me most of the time lately - not least of all because if I order more than 5 shrimp tempura I end up feeling sick.  (frustrating - 1 order is not enough - 2 makes me feel sick.

Old review below:

Wow - I'm surprised at the negative reviews.  Many of them seem to stress bad service, which I can't comment on yet, because I got some food to go, but the guy who took my order went out of his way to make sure the woman who put my order together DID add the extra tempura sauce and extra teriyaki sauce on the side that I asked for.

The shrimp tempura was very good:  large and fresh and a good price for what you get.  $5.50 for 5 BIG shrimp.

The Beef short rib was good"}
{"text":"I had the all-you-can-eat lunch, which I thought was a bit pricey at $12.99 (though there was a 5% cash discount).
There's a pretty decent selection of rolls, though not too many vegetarian options. There were a few interesting unconventional cooked rolls as well.

I thought the fish on the sushi was above average for an AYCE place and the rice held together quite well, so that was a bonus. They classed it up by making a little rosebud with the wasabi too!

Though I generally don't pick too many cooked appetizers, I would have liked to have seen a few more to choose from.

Over all, this place is fine for AYCE lunch, but I'd rather go to Bikkuri (which includes some sashimi for only $10.99)."}
{"text":"Sakura which is located in the location of a former Annex favourite J-Time Sushi is sadly hit and miss. The restaurant is long and narrow with a small window looking south onto Bloor Street. There is a long banquette with NYC styled seating and a few tables for four along the opposite wall. The decor is to say the least, electric-urban. An odd arrangement of lighting that crosses the ceiling and down the walls bathed in odd glows of pink and purple (not the best colours for food). This odd choice in lighting and decor is often reflected in the music which suffers from an identity crisis, often too loud, dancy and boisterous for a restaurant. 

Sometimes the food has been OK, never stellar, but it is local. So we opt for it when we don't want to walk to far. Like so many Annex sushi places the sushi is laced with mayonnaise in the Korean/Toronto style (not my favourite). They are always busy, with a younger clientele drawn by the cheap all-you-can eat options. All you can eat is never that appealing and even though we ordered from the menu, everything we came out bland. We had different dishes from the kitchen and yet the dishes featured the same bland and flavourless vegetables. It left us scratching our heads how such quality leads to so many people?"}
{"text":"It's a good deal. The sushi isn't the best that I've had, but it is of an acceptable quality, and is quite reasonably priced. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The AYCE has a great variety and is a good price. Everything from the wok, grill, and dim sum is really good!!  But unfortunately, the sushi itself is not. The rice used is WAY too sweet -- something I can't stomach.  It's awful.  I tried it a few months ago with the same results, and thought maybe I'd give it another go in case it was just by chance that the rice was made horribly that day. But it was the same -- extremely sweet. Everything else is awesome, but I won't be coming back because I can't eat the rolls or sushi :("}
{"text":"One word: Cockroaches! 
First time ever at this restaurant with a group of 9, as we were eating someone discovered a cockroach on her foot and it was scampering around the table! eek."}
{"text":"Pros: Decent sushi, sashimi, rolls and grilled/cooked food. Pretty good ambience at night time during the weekdays 

CONS: RUDE ASS WAITRESSES THAT EXPECT A TIP WHEN THEY DONT DO ANYTHING. Btw can I mention how RUDE it is to demand for a tip. This lady who gave us attitude as soon as we sat down asked me why I didn't tip when I actually tipped her EXTRA; they added an automatic gratuity on our bills on a weekday for a group of 4...? WHY? 

Also felt a great need for us to finish our meals. It just felt like they wanted us to leave. They kept rushing us.

OVERALL: never again. Not worth it for all you can eat. Basically spent 30 bucks for dinner all you can eat. you can find more awesome places for cheaper."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a great price. Presentation is fantastic, and sushi is wonderful. Of course this is not high end sushi and there are not loads of choices to choose from. It's a fun clean place to get sushi. We love doing a date night here. Quick, easy and yum."}
{"text":"Even though the food was average, I was impressed with the fast service and reasonable ayce dinner price. 

Came here on a Friday night and was seated immediately. It was surprising to see a wide variety of food on the menu - from sashimi, sushi, rolls, deep fried, yakitori, tepanyaki, udon, and even non Japanese foods like pad thai, curry and dimsum. The sashimi and sushi were okay but the karaage and takoyaki were disappointing. However there were two things that caught my eye that I enjoyed. The first was the shrimp sashimi (usually not found in most average ayce Japanese), and second was the taro chips! The shrimp was soft and sweet while the taro chips were thin and crispy - both quite enjoyable. 

Food arrived almost immediately after ordering which I really liked. And the servers were very polite and quick to topping up my tea and water."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. For it being a food court type of food this Sushi is awesome the curry rice is awesome. The price is superb and the service is stupendous. Always fast always polite always Fair priced."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were craving for some AYCE sushi after we survived our 1st week of Insanity workout, LOL! We usually make the trip all the way to Echo Sushi, south of Yonge & Eg, to get our AYCE fix, but our legs were still sore so we wanted to stay in downtown. After a quick search on Yelp, we decided to give Sakura a try. We often passed by this establishment but never gave it a second glance. Until last night...

We've decided that this will be our go-to AYCE sushi place from now on! :)

THE DEETS

Price: $20.99 for AYCE dinner (not bad, I've seen some places charge for $24.99).

Service: quick and attentive. Our food were flowing in at a good pace as soon as we placed our order. Our cold water was refilled frequently. Empty plates were cleaned up pretty quickly as well.

Food: Here's a list of what we had:

- Miso soup: I know, I know. Why did I order a miso soup at an AYCE place? I like to wash down my palate after a few bites. At most AYCE places, miso soup is served at room temperature, which is always a let-down for me. Not at Sakura. The soup was hot! ME LIKEY :)

- Salmon & Butterfish sashimi: pretty thick cut, well presented, served nice and cold. I'm not a sashimi eater, but my boyfriend is and he approved. I did try a piece of the butterfish and it was good!

- Spicy butterfish rolls: YUMMERS! These were a good change from our usual order of Spicy Tuna or Salmon rolls. Crunchy, spicy, YUMMMAAAYYY!!!

- Salmon Tartar: An interesting dish. We think it's a hybrid of sushi and maki roll. They basically chop a piece of salmon sashimi until it becomes a tartar consistency, then place it on top of a round-shaped sushi rice, then drizzle some spicy mayo on top of it all. It looked pretty and tasted quite good :)

- Pepper Beef Tataki: basically an asian take on beef carpaccio. 1 order = 6 slices, but they were VERY SMALL and THIN slices. Tasted pretty good, so I'm not complaining :)

- Beef Yakitori: YUM! Well seasoned!

- Beef Ribs: OMG THE BEST! We kept ordering this dish throughout the night :p

- Deep fried milk: I was curious about this, so we ordered 2. It's basically a deep-fried evaporated milk stick. Does that make any sense? The outer was savoury and crunchy but the inside was soft and sweet. I regretted ordering 2 pieces, though, because I felt sick after eating just one. Not a fan, but it's not a bad dish.

- Baked Mussels: 1 order = 2 mussels. Drenched in spicy mayo. Too much sauce for my liking, but it tasted pretty good.

- Veggie Yaki Udon: not bad. A bit too salty. The udon was cooked to perfection (read: chewy!)

- Butter yaki mushroom: I had high hopes for this dish. I love mushrooms and I was expecting to see a plate of different types of mushrooms (enoki, oyster, cremini, etc). BUT NO. Just white button mushrooms. Meh... :(

- Deep fried cheese wontons: The wonton itself tasted great, but they poured too much sweet and sour sauce over the wontons, so it kinda altered the taste. I would like to see the sauce on the side instead.

- Shrimp Tempura: lightly battered and crunchy, but tasted like any other tempuras at any other Japanese places.

- Desserts: Your typical asian flavoured ice creams - green tea, mango, red bean. I had the mango pudding as well and it tasted very artificial. DO NOT GET THAT.


I would definitely go back to this place and try the other dishes. The menu was extensive and pretty impressive :)"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place. Some items aren't as good as other places. My friends and I only went here because new generation was crowded. This place is just okay. Sashimi and the rolls were pretty good - no complaints. 

I like to start any sushi meal with some miso soup.. What they had here really wasn't good. It was super salty and didn't meet any expectations of what miso soup should taste like. I couldn't finish it. I tried another soup, this time a seafood soup, and that also wasn't too good and was just salty. Maybe stay away from the soups if you come here. Other than that, this place isn't too bad. I'd come back again."}
