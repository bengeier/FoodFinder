{"text":"Great local watering hole. Great staff of bartenders, very friendly and courteous. Intend to go back every time I'm in the area. Was staying in the KOA next to John's Place. Customers were more than friendly. A nice place to hang out a watch football.

{"text":"This is one of the last adult sanctuaries left. This restaurant is connected to Mario's pizza, and no children are allowed in John's Place. It's great. It's a really nice bar area and quiet. A great place to have adult conversation. Wonderful idea. I wish there were more places like this."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to watch the panthers play and followed the reviews to johns place .  While other places have more tv's and variety the food here is amazing ."}
{"text":"Never will I ever go to this place again.  Terrible customer service, management is even worse.  Bad experience."}
{"text":"Great local place, very good prices on drafts, and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. The crowd was a nice mixture - everything from the Grateful Dead to death metal was playing on the jukebox. It looks like the outdoor seating would be nice when it warms up.
I really liked this place and see myself going back. I do wish they had more local craft beers, which would probably bring my review up to a 5. They did have around 12-15 craft beers so the selection had a good representation of styles. I think they are trying though, which is a great start."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Definitely a local feel which I love.  Actually, this place is pretty sizable which was a surprise.  The parking lot is shared with a gas station. They have darts and pool. Bar seating, tall tables, a comfy nook with cushy chairs and a large outside area.  

We love beer and although they have bout 12 on tap, they only had 2 local brews. Would love to see at least one with a little higher octane.  However, the locals that frequent I'm sure are happy with the selection.  

Missy runs a tight ship and is able to handle a full bar, a few occupied tables and a sizeable group outside.  Mixed drinks as well so it caters to all. Price was high for the local brews, probably are exempt from happy hour.  A person ordered a bud light and it was a $1.50. Oh well"}
{"text":"This place is clean and the prices are great! They have happy hour from open to 7pm everyday. Which means $1.50 bud and bud lights. Dollar off mixed drinks too! They also have darts and pool. Fridays they have karaoke as well!"}
{"text":"John's place is a good local bar. The decor is pleasing and clean. The food is average. You can order from the Mario's Pizza menu (Which is attached via a hallway) or order from a limited bar menu. I actually enjoy their sliders (chicken or cheese burger). Really tasty. There is usually some type of drink special and enough TV's to get a good view of whatever game happens to be on. Service is good although can be spotty at times. Pretty much a regular crowd via many of the neighborhoods around the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it is a convenient and nice local pub."}
{"text":"Wow! Never have I been treated so disrespectful in my life, don't bother with the expensive beer and poor wait staff. Watch out for Kelly the manager, she tries to steal money when she thinks her customers won't notice. There are plenty of better bars in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Staff is wonderful.  Has great jukebox with every genre of music.  You can even control it from your phone.  Very large for a place that looks small from the outside.  It's very clean, great clientele.  Folk are very friendly and welcoming.  Could use a few more TV's for sports but enough to satisfy.  Don't think they have the NFL ticket do to the lack of TV's.  

Every Tuesday they have Texas Hold em Tournaments $10 buy in , Every Wednesday  they have $5.00 blind draw Steele Tip dart tournaments, Thursday's are off nights as far as entertainment is concerned.  Friday is Karaoke night at 9:00 and Saturday is live entertainment at 9:00.  The age group of folks ranges so some nights could be college type crowd and other nights could be the 40 and over crowd.  Most times it's a 50/50 mix.  I have to say (is only 2nd time here, came for the poker tournament last night) seems the crowd is primarily male (1-5 ratio maybe which works for me personally being married and all). 

Why I could not give the establishment a 5 star rating is this...No kitchen.  You CAN order pizza from a pizza joint in the plaza and Johns will take care of that but other than that, it's a watering hole.  Another reason is, although they have a plethora of cornhole boards (bags are horrible - I was able to find 7 bags not broken sitbring your own) and you can play anytime you want, they no longer have tournaments.  Would LOVE to see that come back.  One last thing I think they could use is one or 2 ping pong tables for additional entertainment.  

All in all I really enjoy it here...Oh, DO NOT bring folks UNDER 21 years old.  They don not let kids in here.  Yesterday and today I came alone (without wife unfortunately) but hope to make some friends and just have a good time"}
{"text":"Spent a great evening catching a televised basketball game and enjoying Tuesday evening discounted brick oven pizza.  Clean and still \"new\". Great lines of sight to extra large video screens. Super food and service. I've come to know Barry the G.M. there, and he is a super host."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Charlotte area and looking for a good place to watch Sunday football when I came across John's place. I walked in and immediately knew this would be a great place to watch a game. The walls are covered in Yankee memorabilia and the huge bar has plenty of seats. If you choose to sit at one of the many tables, there is a perfect view of one of the many huge TVs from every seat. 

When halftime rolled around, I started to get hungry and asked the girl behind the bar (not too tough on the eyes) if the food is good. She pointed out a few items on the ample menu and highly recommended that I try the pizza, so I ordered a slice and some wings. This is with out a doubt the best pizza I have had outside of New York! The wings were also delicious, very big and meaty. 

I would recommend John's Place to anyone around the Mathews area. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A kind of cool, old school dive bar. They have a nice draft beer selection, and a nice outdoor patio. Bands on weekends, NFL football on Sunday. Sundays they have a nice buffet to enjoy while you watch the games. We met some nice folks here and had a really good time when they had a Wicked Weed tap takeover."}
{"text":"We celebrated our cousins entry running for Indian Trail Town Council. It was our introduction to Johns Place and the food. I'd not had arancini in years (from NJ, 10 years in NC) and it was wonderful! Creamy, flavorful,  like risotto. They had stuffed mushrooms, really enjoyed the creaminess and salty bacon flavor. Fantastic and secretly one of my favorites  (I love stuffed mushrooms!). There were deep fried ravioli and a vidka sauce that was phenomenal. Then there was the cheesesteak eggrolls. Wow! Great staff and food. We would definitely travel back out that way to enjoy good food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for some good drinks.. And it was amazing. The service  is great. Food next door at Mario are excellent. Look for Dave.. He's the GM.. He will take care of you. The John's Place interior is relaxing and very clean. Give it a try and have a relaxing day."}
{"text":"We luv this place! Been coming since it opened!  I  the Pineapple Martini. This place is definitely for adults & the atmosphere is awesome! John u did great!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is amazing.  Service is great.  No big brunch crowd.  The shrimp and egg carpaccio is the best dish I've ever had for brunch."}
{"text":"My Husband and I love it here.  It makes you feel like you are in an authentic Italian restaurant in NYC.  Sanitation score is always 99 or above, plenty of TVs and the rich wood gives it such a cozy feel.  Sometimes you can see John at a back table enjoying red vino with his Wife.  They always have good drink specials and the food is always on point. I either get the Meatball parm or pizza sub with different toppings.  Delish!!!!  Comes with chips, onion rings or fries and the freshest pickle you will ever have.  I wish they had side options that weren't all that greasy...Well, my waist line does. Nicole is always there to greet you with a friendly smile and departs you with a friendly goodbye.  Very attentive and genuinely happy to be there.  It's a regular dining joint for us!!  Salute!!"}
{"text":"We rolled into John's Place one evening, not knowing quite what to expect.  The thing about a restaurant.com gift certificate is that at least you can score a decent price, right?

The first thing we found was surprising - it was liking walking into a dive somewhere in New York, albeit a bit wider, and probably a hundred years newer.  But the bar in John's is simply awesome.  If there were no sports playing on fancy flat-screen televisions, I would think someone was about to get whacked in the back corner.

Having to reach a certain level for the bill to trigger the gift certificates, we ordered up a storm - casual dining is not necessarily the best place to use these things.  But it does give you a chance to sample the menu.

Everything we tried was solid - though not especially memorable.  The best thing we had, surprisingly, was a spicy chicken appetizer.  Something you would totally not expect from this sort of place.  It would be more appropriate at Applebee's.

Even so, the atmosphere is cool, and the service is definitely friendly.  It is still odd that you walk into a place named John's Place and get menus for Mario's (next door - I think they share a kitchen).  Maybe John and Mario are on the lam, so they opened this place together.  Just make sure no one mentions my name if it comes to that.  Fuggedaboutit."}
{"text":"Saturday night and we didn't feel like going out so we ordered delivery from John's place which I guess is also known as Mario's Italian.  Order included: mozzarella sticks, lobster ravioli, side caesar, chicken francese, side garden salad.  Website to order was easy to navigate and allowed us to pay ahead with a card plus tip ($2 delivery fee automatic).  Food arrived still warm and only took about 40 minutes (quote was 60).  Food review:  ravioli was ok but vodka sauce was bland; salad was good, fresh iceberg, dressings were ok nothing special.  Chicken Francese was also just ok, nothing special.  Hefty size chicken breast and tasted freshly made.  Overall, it was decent delivery but probably would have been disappointed if we would have actually went into the restaurant for the price and quality of food (~$50).  Probably won't eat there or order there again."}
{"text":"It's a great place to hang out and have a drink. Also a good atmosphere to get to know your new neighbors around the area"}
{"text":"Great true sports bar!    5 Star service, great prices, pool, darts, outdoor patio.    No kids allowed, no food...,,BUT the place next door has pizza until 10pm.     Bring you own steel tip darts, house darts may not be available.  So clean, comfortable and friendly!"}
