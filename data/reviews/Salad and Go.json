{"text":"Drive through health conscious food? Count me in. Delicious salads and wraps. Even tried a juice and was impressed. Will continue to drive through!"}
{"text":"What an awesome concept - healthy, affordable, and fast! I had the cobb salad with steak and seasonal blueberry rosemary lemonade, and my boyfriend had the BBQ ranch wrap with chicken on honey wheat tortilla and traditional lemonade.   Everything was fresh and delicious, and the portions were big (my salad was dinner last night and lunch today). This is a much needed option for take-out after work, and they open early for a protein-packed breakfast and picking up lunch on the way to work. We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Love their BBQ Ranch salad/wrap. A little expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! My husband calls for salads all the time! Always fresh and taste so good on these hot humid summer days!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious! Excellent customer service as well. Salad is larger than expected, will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible and delicious. And very reasonably priced. $5.74 for a salad or wrap. I am in love. With fast, friendly service and healthy, this is my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Love having a healthy option around -- the drive-thru is very convenient and the food was great. I tried the Greek salad and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had driven by many times and last night thought why not try it. I got the mixed greens with the faux chicken and my wife got the mixed greens wrap big salads fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"This is a great place with a super friendly staff! Their food is fast, fresh and delicious.........thank you!! PS - go for the Cobb."}
{"text":"We have been eating here awhile and all I can say is that we love this place! The salads are always fresh and the amount of items they put in your salad are always generous and not once are we never left satisfied. This has become a regular spot for great salads and a nice change from all the fast food options out there."}
{"text":"Horrible quality, Not even a one star, the size of my wrap is a quarter of a normal wrap, not worth the money I wasted on this."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get healthy food on the run. The prices are reasonable and the service is always good. The employees are friendly and accommodating.  Most important is that the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of these wraps! I would come here every day if it was a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Today, my husband and I visited this convenient salad place for the first time; we'll be regulars. Prices were great. Salads were fresh and creative. As I sat near the order window, I could hear the the interactions with the customers. WOW, all the staff were just delightful. Professional, efficient and friendly. When I returned to get a TO GO  item, I positively commmented and the clerk asked my name stating that they like to know their customers. WOW- you gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Really loved it! Went there today for my first time! Had always wanted to try it! i go there and i ordered, everything was perfect when i got home! Huge portion for the price! love everything and will be back very soon! I Also took my dog and the lady at the window gave her a biscuit :) A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"Nice and BIG salads, i had the cobb salad of course, and couldnt even finish it. Very delish, and a nicr healthy option right around the corner."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite before work. Ordered green tropical smoothie, iced chai latte, and turkey sausage tacos. Even the salsa is amazingly delicious. Service was quick and efficient. The food smelled so good as soon as the windows opened. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Placed my order for 2 salads with extra dressing. Received 2 salads that were NOT what I ordered and a wrap. I go back even though it is the tiniest location and packed full of people. The kid at the window could give 2 shits about my order and asked to speak with a manager to which I was told it would be another 10 min before they could get to remaking my order. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and they manage to mess my order up both times. The first time I ordered a Santa Fe salad with steak and they had forgot to put the steak, of course I went back and the employees were nothing but nice! No complaints on customer service at all. Just upset at the fact that every time I order something its not ever right. I also ordered a Cobb Salad with steak too. They forgot to put the bacon in the salad... not mad but just a bummer. I was expecting more from this place since the other locations are nothing but positive experiences!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful taste and doesn't make you feel bloated afterwards. Prices are good too. For a must for me to go here now!!"}
{"text":"Always the best service, salads, wraps, and smoothies are all good. My favorite is the BBQ on honey wheat wrap with chicken. You can very easily remove things from their menu items to accommodate diet or allergies."}
{"text":"This place is just ok I suppose. I've made healthier and more tasty salads on my own.   But each time I've gone through their drive thru, the lady that's there takes my card and gives me the weirdest look, like she's offended."}
{"text":"Strawberry & spinich smoothie.....BAMM!!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! My favorite is the Greek with steak!!! Soooo good!!! I go at least 1-2 times a week!"}
{"text":"This place is ABSOLUTELY the best! The lines are long but move super quick, the staff is always happy and smiling and the salads are always fresh and delicious. I tried one of their smoothies today and added pea protein, it was the perfect meal. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with this place. Perfect quick lunch break spot! Their salads are huge and delicious. I was running late to work once and decided to swing through for breakfast, the Warm Quinoa Bowl is absolutely amazing.  The Sweet Potato salad for lunch is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"I love going to Salad and Go they are quick, very friendly and have the most amazing lemonades! I love that everything is in season and reasonably priced for being \"fast food\". I can't ever take my kids or have them around after I get something from there because they finish it before I get a bite or sip. However, if they are with me they do get their own lemonades and beg to go back every time we pass it!"}
{"text":"As long as you don't plan on dining in the food and service were both outstanding. The people were very friendly and helpful for first time patrons questions about the menu and drinks.  Pricing of items is more than fair. I would definitely go again. I wish one was in the town that we live in. I would be there every other day."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I just had the BBQ RANCH WRAP, this is my second time getting it and it's so good. But I had also added steak on my wrap and when I was ready to eat it. IT HAD NO STEAK!  I will still give it a thumbs up because regardless it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service!! The staff is awesome, there is something for the whole family and it's healthy!! I'll be coming back time and time again!"}
{"text":"It was the Grand Opening of the Pinnacle Peak location and figured I would stop in and give this place a try as I had heard some good reviews of the other locations.  It worked out great since it is right up the street from work.  I ordered the Kale and Banana Smoothie and it was delicious!  They had the option for an added soy based protein supplement, but I skipped it this time.  On top of the fresh and delicious taste, the service was quick and friendly.  I would recommend stopping in if you need to grab something healthy and quick for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner or even just a snack!"}
{"text":"Salad and Go is a great place to grab a quick salad or wrap. I very much appreciate their selection of all natural and organic products, and sodas made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup. I have not had any quality issues with the food."}
{"text":"One word.....DELICIOUS!  Love that it is open early enough to stop and pick up lunch before work!"}
{"text":"My family loves and frequents the Gilbert Rd location, so we are pleased when they opened the Cooper/Warner location closer to our home. Our favorite salads are the cobb (no need to add meat since it is loaded with bacon and boiled eggs), the chicken caesar, the spinach and bacon, and the bbq! We also love their fresh smoothies made with real ingredients like kale and spinach and whole fruit. My kiddos love the turkey cucumber pinwheels (which we have begun mimicking in their school lunches)! Besides being healthy and delicious, this place is also affordable, and oftentimes cheaper than the greasy fast food options. This week our family of four ate dinner (with chicken added to the adult salads) for $25. Last week, my husband drove through Wendy's and got food for three people (him and our two kids) and it was $29. We'd much rather eat at Salad and Go!"}
{"text":"After my first visit and my previous, 2-star review, Roushan and Tony (two of the owners) contacted me to address my concern. They used my previous review to re-train their staff on consistent measurements/preparations. They also offered to comp my next salad since my first visit was not a positive one. This is excellent, top-notch customer service and smart business sense. They truly want to satisfy their customers and make whatever changes necessary to do so. Kudos to them for being eager to hear what needs to be fixed and not being defensive about it!  So, a few days after my fist visit, I visited again. This time I got the Cobb salad. It was delicious. The toppings were generous (sliced boiled eggs, a lot of crumbled bacon, fresh sliced cherry/grape tomatoes, blue cheese, and avocado), there was the perfect amount of dressing (enough to flavor it without overpowering it), and everything was incredibly fresh. The Cobb salad, along with their incredible customer service, earns them my 5-stars!  I am so happy that Gilbert has a place like this, offering fresh, healthy, and organic fast food at affordable prices. I hope Salad and Go succeeds and expands. My family will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love the Cobb salad here without the chicken!! There is already avocado and bacon bits! Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have one open near my home. It had been over a year since I last visited a salad-and-go. Dissatisfied with the entire experience. Ordered at the walk up window and thought the attendant was less than interested in my order. Dressing was not tossed in and there was an overwhelming amount of onion. Albeit, silly things to complain about..but if you're going to claim to be great you should not be stumbling over the basics."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out since I've seen them on Facebook a lot. I ordered a BBQ ranch salad with chicken and a tea. The total was $10 so it wasn't crazy expensive. Omg!!!! Best darn salad ever! So glad they have a place like this."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and had absolutely loved this place! My kids also love dining here when we are trying to grab a quick bite!  We always ordered the same thing every single time! Thai steak salad lightly dressed, banana Nutella pinwheels and turkey cucumber pinwheels.  I discovered that they had changed their menu this morning!!! I was complaining to my husband the other day that he got me the wrong salad because the ingredients did not jive! Now I owe him an apology because they totally took away the Thai Asian Salad and replaced it with an Asian salad! The current Asian salad has pieces of pineapples and the dressing just did not go together. I am so sad to have discovered that they put the previous Asian salad in it's grave....I guess this will not be my go to anymore uhhhh....so sad!  I hate when restaurants do this...they have something that a lot of people like and decide to pull it away for whatever reasons."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.Great selection. Love that you can make any salad a wrap and have 2 wrap choices. Good value as portions generous. Ingredients very fresh. Love that they asked how I wanted dressing..only complaint was that the shrimp was a little bland and undercooked. I will definitely be back and highly recommend going there. This place takes customer service and their product very seriously.."}
{"text":"I ordered the capris salad.  Remember the movie waterworld where Kevin Costner had the tomato plant on his boat with one lone tomato on it.   That's what this reminded me of.  So skimpy on ingredients I will say that they actually used 2 tomato in my 6 dollar salad but the were cherry tomatoes and then they cut them in half to make it seem like you got more.  There were a couple pieces of some gross cheese and other than that it was different kinds of lettuce or kale or whatever it was.  Vinaigrette dressing on the side.  The most unimpressive salad I ever had in my life.  Honestly if I had gone to the supermarket and bought one of those bags of pre cut salad and a bottle of salad dressing and just poured the dressing in the bag it would have tasted at least as good and probably better.  And it certainly would have cost a lot less.  I downloaded the yelp app just so I could tell everyone how horrible this is.  I can't understand the other reviews that say their food is good.  Must be trolls hired by the company.  Anyway walk across the drive to the olive market and get a much better salad.  A little more expensive but at least it does taste good and won't leave you feeling like you got totally ripped off.  Can't wait to see what opens there next after these clowns go out of business."}
{"text":"Really good salad quickly prepared.  Ingredients were crisp and fresh and dressings (I tried Ranch, Blue Cheese, and Caesar) were all tasty and had high quality.  I did get two orders of chicken with my Cobb salad because one order just wasn't enough -- but it was still well under $10.00.  So if you want a fast, good, affordable salad you can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SALAD AND GO!!!!!! west Phoenix needs more options like this!!!! I have visited countless times already and haven't been disappointed!! Even the seasonal menu is A1!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I got the sweet potato salad! Such nice staff, and super affordable prices. My salad was $6 and super big and filling!! It was such a fun experience I want to work here to be honest!!  Overall INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"Great, gourmet quality food, fast, and at very fair prices.  The staff is extremely professional and personable.  Dealt with a great young man named Dylan - top notch service!!!  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Me (and my office) are obsessed with Salad and Go! This place just rocks, not only is it a healthy choice but a filling choice! The salads are a great size and about $6 each, service is fast and friendly, and the location is easily accessible. I can't wait to try their breakfast some time!"}
{"text":"Superb salads! I've had the Cobb and the Santa fe...I can't believe the freshness of the ingredients. Lots of salad for the price. I could seriously eat here everyday if it was closer (open one more south, like all the way to Riggs!!). For a treat, try the lemonade!"}
{"text":"I have been excited to try Salad and Go for a few weeks now. I went late on a Saturday morning and there was absolutely no one there. I was greeted quickly and reviewed the menu. I knew I wanted a salad but couldn't decide which one. They all sounded so good! I decided on the Asian salad. I was pleasantly surprised when they asked if I wanted the dressing tossed or on the side. I opted for tossed. The salad was just ok for me. The ingredients were all fresh and nicely proportioned however the dressing was bland. I could have used more dressing and some more flavor. The chicken was nice and didn't taste like that fake chicken you sometimes get on fast food salads. I am still giving this place 4 starts because I love the concept, prices are reasonable and the ingredients were so fresh. I will be going back and trying a different kind of salad. Maybe next time I will ask for extra dressing."}
{"text":"First timer here and tried the caprese salad with chicken.  Wow!!  Super fresh. Super crisp. Super yummy.  I can't wait to try all of their salads which are a handful but also on the menu smoothies, kids wraps and more.  So excited they are close by!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to Salad and go since they opened. I eat here about once a week. Never had a bad experience here. Always fresh ,fast ,and the employees are friendly..Try them out !"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!   Food is fresh and flavorful... Fast service and reasonable prices.  I always order the Santa Fe with fresh shrimp and the shrimp is  so good .. You woun't be disappointed with the drive-thru.  A must try"}
{"text":"I go to Salad and Go very often and every time I have been very pleased! I'm not a very big Salad fan, so when I first started going, when they first opened, I would get the BBQ Ranch wrap. Then I started to try other things and I fell in love with the Caprese salad with chicken. That is the best tasting salad I have ever had! The service is always great, and pretty fast even when they're busy. I usually walk up to the window since the drive thru is usually too long. This has become my go to lunch place and I would highly recommend, even to people who aren't fans of salads."}
{"text":"Great new place in the west valley.  Customer service is good.  Healthy fast food place!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying them. I went through the drive-thru. This place is only a week old, so I expected a line. Luckily there were only two cars in the drive-thru. We were all serviced quickly. The woman at the window was very polite and friendly. Got home to eat the salads and they were a great size and delicious! I got dressing on the side, since I did not know how much would be mixed in. Everything was tasty. Going to try their breakfast next!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price and healthy. The staff was very friendly and it was fast. Really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for Friday night dinner. I got the BBQ ranch wrap with chicken, the wife got a Cobb with steak. She picked them up, both very good but the Cobb, like my BBQ ranch wrap, was chicken, even though she was charged for steak. The wife loves her steak so that was disappointing. Hate when a place screws up something so simple as an order. We'll go back, hopefully they'll be better at getting things right..."}
{"text":"Excellent salads.  Fresh veggies and prompt service.  Exactly what I would want from a \"Salad and Go\" kind of place.  Great for on-the-run lunches.  But, at lunchtime, get there early because the drive thru lane fills up really fast."}
{"text":"I stop here fairly regularly on my way to work, because they open early. I pick up a salad for my lunch, and they are always so contentious about putting the dressing on the side (you can get it tossed with the dressing if you like) and putting any crunchy tortilla strips or croutons in a baggie if you want so that they don't get soggy before lunchtime. They are very accommodating if you ask for different types of lettuce or want to have all spinach. They use local and organic produce when possible, and genuinely care about customer satisfaction.   I haven't tried anything from the breakfast menu except the Peanut Butter crunch power wrap, but is it DEVINE.  You really can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week, and I love their food. Its healthy, fresh, and organic. They usually have good service and customize my order now and then. Yesterday I was going for my usual, a salad wrap with chicken, but I got an extra surprise with it. I felt a weird texture in my mouth and pulled out a whole cricket"}
{"text":"I'm upset because I went this morning to order a salad. Repeated my order twice, the lady at the window repeated my order perfectly and they still messed up my order. I asked for a Greek salad without cheese and olives, and when I got to work (20 miles away) I noticed there were olives and cheese mixed in my salad. Could you imagine if I was allergic and didn't notice until I started eating it? Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing and everyone is always super friendly. The vegetarian protein option is delicious and it's really nice that the staff is knowledgeable about which salads, dressings, etc are vegetarian/ vegan."}
{"text":"Such a great idea! Loved, loved, loved my salad! Too bad I don't have one near my house, but when back in Gilbert a must do!"}
{"text":"I love love love salad and go. I have moved out of the area now, there is nothing like this where I live and I have been going through withdraw! Always fresh crisp greens, unique choices and great big portions! Fast and easy to make a good choice and avoid the stale fast food salads."}
{"text":"When they get your order right this place is delicious! Just have to be careful to check your bag before you leave a lot of time seems like they are used to making the same old salads so when you say dairy/gluten free they forget. Other than that the actual variety and salads are great! I will say I stick to the salads.. because I Haven't tasted a good soup from here yet.."}
{"text":"I come here far more than I probably should but it's relentlessly awesome every time. Even when drive thru lines are long, the staff gets through it pretty quick  with quality food each time. Their breakfast is awesome and the coffee is organic. All of their salads (especially the Caesar) is great with the right amount of dressing mixed in."}
{"text":"This business is right by ours, so we grab lunch there quite often.  It's pretty much a given that the salads are great; fresh, big, flavorful.   But the hidden gem is their Arnold Palmers!   They come in two sizes and your choice of tea.  I recommend the black tea version."}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced! I ordered a Santa Fe salad and a blueberry lemonade (seasonal flavor). Both were very good! The salad was crisp...and toppings were not stale or old tasting. I think I will try having my salad dressing mixed in and try their mint infused lemonade next time I go. I think the menu has something for everyone! If you are in the area ..stop in..you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite drive thru. Salads are huge and taste amazing and fresh! They are really friendly and quick!!!! Haven't had anything I didn't like but I usually get the cobb."}
{"text":"Fresh and fast salads.I really enjoy being able to pick up such a healthy meal so easily. They have a great selection and every time I have eaten here the ingredients were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Bomb! Fresh and delicious need I say more. Huge portions! You will not stay hungry even tough it's a salad. This side of town was definitely in need of a healthy fast food option that is also friendly to vegans and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Such a brilliant concept. Everything I've had has been delicious, fresh, and served up promptly!"}
{"text":"My new favorite stop in Higley. So nice to have such fast, refreshing food. My only complaint would be prices. While you do get a lot of salad (and I mean a LOT), I know I'd prefer to get less and pay less. However, it is justifiable seeing as it's all fresh and organic food. Just a suggestion! Will be coming back for a long time!!!"}
{"text":"i love this place!! so quick and convenient for a healthier option!!! my absolute fave is the Cobb salad with steak and dressing tossed inside. i love the black tea, i wish there was more ice when i get my drink, but that's ok. it's still a great place to visit for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I drove by their first location for over a year and thought it looked sketchy. Once the second location opened, I thought \"alright, maybe this is legit.\" I like that you can get the salads as wraps. I had the chicken Caesar as a wrap and my co-workers were asking where it can from because it looked so good.   The smoothies are amazing! I've had the peach basil lemongrass smoothie and the strawberry spinach smoothie and both were delightful.  I just tried their breakfast. I had the protein wrap and it was to die for.   I favored their smoothies and breakfast to their salads. However, the salads are fine...nothing to write home about other than you can get them in a fast food setting, which is a bonus in my book! I will definitely be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"I want a salad and go rewards program needs to happen because this place is AMAZING:)"}
{"text":"This is this restaurant's 2nd location.  The salads here are the same high quality offerings that they have at their original location. If you've been there you know what I'm talking about.  I think the design of the facilities here shows that they've learned and evolved from the original location. There is more shade over the outdoor seating area and there are tables on the north side of the building (which will be a blessing in the hot months). I try not to use drive-throughs due to personal preference but from what I observed it's very efficient here.  The staff here is as friendly as it gets. They really make an effort to get to know you and your preferences. They call me by name when I walk up!   If you're in east Chandler or west Gilbert you'd be well advised to stop in and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I would definitely recommend! Service was quick and friendly. I ordered the southwest cesar salad. Veeerryyyy good and the size of the salad you recieve is completely worth the value. I had heard they were a little on the pricey side, but I disagree. Any quick or \"fast food\" style salad you recieve is comparable or more in price but does not nearly meet the quality. My salad was fresh and crisp. I fully enjoyed my first experience and I cannot wait to try more. Great for a quick, healthier option."}
{"text":"Super yummy Greek salad with chicken!  Perfect size to fill you up and its literally the fastest \"fast food\" I've had."}
{"text":"I eat here every day. Today I found a hair in my salad after eating a quarter of it. Pretty grossed out."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect: huge, gourmet salads at a reasonable price in a DRIVE-THRU!!!   These guys have a great concept."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Finally a healthy fast food drive thru. The staff is helpful and patient. The prices are very affordable for what you're getting. I ordered the lemonade but probably won't get that again, it was a little watered down. The Cobb salad was so delicious though. I added steak to my salad for an additional $2. Overall I think my meal was $11. Not bad for a healthier faster optional. Will definitely return sometime this week!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Always fresh. Always fast. Always good. Always delightfully friendly."}
{"text":"The salads from here are better than a number of mid level sit down restaurants that want $15+  for smaller portion sizes. In addition, they taste great."}
{"text":"Seriously so impressed with this place! I've been here about 3 times since they've opened and they have so many unique, healthy and affordable options. Quick and friendly service as well."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!! Good portions food is always fresh wraps, salads and soups !!!  My kid enjoys their kid meals., it's just great when your a trying to stay on the healthy side... And it's cheap !"}
{"text":"Salad and Go is awesome! I got the Asian salad with tofu and it was really tasty and bigger than I expected - perfect for lunch. My boyfriend was really hesitant to try it with me but ended up loving his Asian chicken wrap and breakfast smoothie. Our food was super fresh and we couldn't believe how fast we got through the line.. we had our food within a minute of ordering it! It was kind of crazy. They have a few good vegan options on the menu and there was a vegan soup on the specials board as well. I'm stoked to have this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!  I would eat here again. I ordered the Greek Salad and Santa Fe. Had a little of both and very good."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious, I have been here a few times. The teas are pretty good but I feel like they need to be stronger.   I love that it's a drive thru, I love that it's fast.   One time I got the tortilla soup, it was so good.  I also got a children's turkey wrap which was filling and amazing. I have gotten a few different salads. Some of the salad seem like the ingredients don't sound good together so I haven't tried them. The Asian salad for example sounds good but the ingredients are weird and unlike a traditional Asian salad you would see at a restaurant.   I got the antipasto salad today. I loved it. Idk why I added chicken when there was already Salame!! Whoops. The only thing is it literally came with 3 artichoke halves.... that's all, and I happen to love artichokes. Also I asked for my dressing on the side so they put it in my salad and carved out a spot for it which makes me feel like they skipped out on some of my toppings...  The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because I feel that for how expensive their salads are there should be free croutons or something the options are so limited, the salads I have had without meat have not filled me up at all and it feels like a waste of money for a $8 without meat, but it's like $2 to add meat. So essentially your paying almost $7-10 for a small-ish salad. So if there were a crouton option I would love that.   All in all this place is pretty good, not the first place I would pick but it's conveniently located for me so that's a plus and it's a drive thru. I would not go out of my way to eat here FYI because the salads are small and the ingredient combinations are a little weird for most of the salads and like I said the iced tea is not strong at all."}
{"text":"Pretty good salad place. I ordered a cobb salad and could aks them not to put the foods i didnt like in it; like blue cheese. Huge salads for 6$ but needed more than 1 dressing cup!"}
{"text":"Although a bit more expensive than if you were to make a salad yourself, it is a great salad with fresh ingredients. My husband and I have gone there a handful of times and the ingredients are always fresh, including the lettuce (which is surprisingly hard for a lot of places that make salads!). I always ask for the dressing on the side so I can split the salad in half and save some for another meal. I'd highly recommend this place, especially if you are looking for a healthy alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Cooper and Warner location this morning.  The breakfast bowl is delicious!  Very surprised by the flavor.  Egg whites were perfectly done.  Iced Bergies coffee is always the best!  This will be my new 1 x a week treat!"}
{"text":"Finally quick and healthy food options at a fair price. I've tried the Caesar, Greek and Cobb salads. Ample amount of dressing and plenty of salad. I was satisfied but not stuffed upon finishing a salad. The ingredients were fresh and made to order. This will be my go to spot for grabbing a couple salads to take for lunch. I wish there were more locations around town."}
{"text":"It use to be good, quality has gone down. Got a dressing that was pure water and a ok salad for $10, that's a scam."}
{"text":"We eat there 3 to 4 times a week. We love all their salads, and their honey wheat wrap is incredible. All the crew is always very nice, especially to our dogs. The owners really care and put their hearts into the business. They are all about customer service. Can't express enough how fresh and very tasty the salads are (huge portions). We eat at both locations!"}
{"text":"I have been there a couple times now ordering at the drive thru. Never had any problems and everybody is friendly. Salad portions are large and at a good price. My favorite is the bbq ranch salad and the spinach and strawberry smoothie!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for fresh food. I had the southwest salad with shrimp and it was delicious. I went with a couple of friends and they enjoy their food also. I would recommend Salad and Go to any one who loves good food that tastes great."}
{"text":"This place is a life saver for busy days. I was in and out of the drive-thru today in less than two minutes. And the portions are huge! A cauldron of flavorful salad for $5 + tax? Can't beat it   The southwest Cesar is one of my favorites, and the fall menu chicken pot pie soup is a must try as well"}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and a seasonal pear salad with chicken (but got a roasted sweet potato salad with chicken by mistake- thus the 4 stars). Both salads were fresh, and full of goodies. Generous portions of meat, veggies, fruit (in the sweet potato salad) and lettuce, including romaine. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Holy crap- if you love bang for your buck, then you're at the right place! HUGE salad and good size soup. I've never tried this place before and I will be back.  Quick service also."}
{"text":"Wow! Food is awesome! Love the Greek and Santa Fe salads. I think they make their own dressing. The food is tasty,  filling and healthy. I can't wait to go back and try the quinoa breakfast."}
{"text":"Been there twice now and this time my wife and daughter had salads as well. My wife echoed my sentiment from last week that their cobb salad might be the best salad we've ever eaten. I'll be back and you should go there too. PS they subbed the blue cheese for huge chunks of fresh motz... I mean GTFO here. Go now!!!"}
{"text":"Went over to have a look and picked up the Cobb salad with shrimp. It was so delicious and healthy. The service was quick and friendly. I wish it was closer to me then I could go everyday."}
{"text":"i love the greek salad here! drive up a grab and go. i like it!"}
{"text":"Best fast food in history of the term \"fast food\".    All options are healthy, you can get a large salad for $5.99, breakfast, teas and now even lattes.    We are so excited to have one open blocks away from us"}
{"text":"Great fresh salads! Friendly and efficient service. Cobb salad, caprese salad and the rosemary blueberry lemonade are great."}
{"text":"I have only tried one salad so far but it was delicious and the ingredients were fresh and of good quality.   It's a little bit pricey compared to other fast food places but well worth it for an alternative to the usual greasy burger.  I know they're going for natural and healthy but I sure wish I could get a Diet Coke with my salad."}
{"text":"Quick, yummy and inexpensive! Location is great too."}
{"text":"I've been pleased with my experiences so far. I've gone several times and have yet to try something that isn't good. Yes sometimes they take a little longer to get your salad to you but I'd rather wait an extra minute or so for a freshly prepared salad than breeze through with an already prepared one that's been sitting in the fridge.  I really hope they continue to do well because this is exactly what we need. A healthy drive thru alternative!"}
{"text":"Um... yum! I opted for the sweet potato and strawberry wrap on a honey wheat tortilla with no additional protein. It was so good and it was the size of an overstuffed Chipotle burrito. I was really excited to get such great, fresh, healthy food at such a great price. The passion black tea tasted like it was brewed in houses and wasn't full of sugar. I would love to see one of these places down in Tucson and will definitely go back next time I am at the airport in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Best salads!  So fresh and healthy!  Perfect size!  Love the Cobb and BBQ!  The shrimp is really good in all the salads.   Hope they open one soon in southeast chandler!"}
{"text":"Four words, \"Hair in my salad.\"  Seriously, I threw up a little when I found a long black hair in my sweet potato & strawberry salad."}
{"text":"I thought the value was great for a high quality salad full of extra ingredients and not just stuffed full of lettuce filler.  I had enough for two lunches with the one salad I bought.  Very tasty and so happy that a salad restaurant has opened up so close to me!  I'll definitely stop here regularly..."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty salad at incredible price.  A salad at Modern Grove is 12 dollars. I can drive down the street and get a larger and better one here for half the price!"}
{"text":"I've only been there once and I ordered from the drive thru and I think the salad is really good. It taste fresh and organic. I got the tofu and it was delicious. I would recommended this to anyone who like salad and is vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The salad greens are very fresh, with a nice mix of lettuces in those that have mixed lettuce.  Inexpensive, too.  All salads are $5.74, unless you add a protein (chicken, steak, chicken substitute or shrimp), those range from $1.44 to $2.49.  I've had the \"Roasted Sweet Potato and Strawberry\" and the \"Asian\".  Both were really good.  There are 10 salads on their menu, which can also be prepared as wraps,   I saw that another reviewer had disliked the cucumber mint lemonade, but I really loved it!  The prices are very reasonable and the staff was friendly and efficient.  All menu items come with basic nutrition information (calories, carbs, protein, fat, etc.) posted.  They also have breakfast, including an all-day breakfast menu, smoothies, teas and coffee (coffee only served in the morning).  Overall, a great, healthy meal for a low price."}
{"text":"Great alternative to usual fast food... Clean place and friendly staff... I'm in town for the weekend and eating here has been the best decision I've made in the past month!! Will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I basically paid 6$ for a bowl of lettuce and few slices of olives and a pinch of feta cheese. Two cherry tomatoes slices up and a slice of a cucumber cut in half. The poorest Greek salad I've ever received in my life. Everywhere I go I get Greek. The dressing tastiest like a cheap home made attempt. It was most definitely not a traditional Greek dressing. This is nothing up to par with a Greek salad. I am very disappointed. Maybe other things are better but don't get the Greek salad. And the concept is nice but should add vegan and vegetarian options. The staff was great and friendly. It was Just the food that was sad."}
{"text":"Love having a place to go get a good salad, at a reasonable price! My friends and I like going here dor lunch. Really enjoy how the menu changed with the seasons.  Great Job, keep it up and we will keep coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Bbq ranch salad is my favorite !!! Love the freshness in the salads right by my house perfect little salad bar in the area recommend it to anyone wanting a quick salad to go !! Also staff is always very nice and quick !! Recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good when they first opened, but slowly it has gotten bad. In the beginning the salad bowls were full. Now they started not filling the bowls as much to save money probably. Last night they gave me unripe avocado in my salad. It was so hard it was inedible. Tonight was the LAST straw... ordered a Cobb salad and they DIDN'T have any tomatoes, bacon, or avocado. They still wanted to charge me full price for lettuce, egg, and Shrimp. $8+ for only half the ingredients for my salad and would not substitute!!! CRAZY!!  I'm done with this location. Too bad since it's right down the road from my house. Oh well."}
{"text":"Amazing and healthy salads and salad wraps for about the same price as fast food combo choices. Drive thru style with a few outdoor tables. I eat here a few times a month. The salad choices are really diverse."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I got the Cobb salad and added chicken protein. I'm glad I got the dressing on the side because the salad was enough for two people. Now I have a second meal! This salad was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be going back. Don't be fooled by the long line at the drive thru I didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Not a fan! I went for the first time today and I'll never go back. I only went there bc I was on crutches, wanted something healthy, and needed a drive thru. I purchased a salad with extra cheese and add avocado... both were $.99 cents. I received 2 slices of avocado and very little cheese. The salad was just ok for paying $9. I'd rather do take out at mad greens or Cafe Zupas (my particular favorite, so good! And you get a chocolate dipped strawberry for free with your order!) I should of just done Uber eats tonight and paid the $2.99 on delivery, since I just paid $2 for nothing here. Not satisfied, unhappy customer, and never to return again!"}
{"text":"I often come here for lunch for a quick salad! Food is delivered quickly and extremely filling! BBQ ranch is my fav! Don't forget to add the protein, chicken is awesome!    Pro tip: drive thru is often 10 cars deep at lunch time! Park and order at the window! I often get my lunch salad quicker this way!"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here several times since it has opened. Close by, quick, healthy and great service.  We have had several of the wraps. The Chicken Cobb wrap, BBQ ranch wrap with dressing on the side, and the Santa Fe Chicken Wrap. All were generous portions and very fresh.  Great flavor and the chicken is nicely seasoned. You can do any wrap with or without your choice of protein which includes chicken, steak, shrimp and a soy based substitute I think. Southwest Caesar salads and Asian Salads are also great. Lots of dressing choices too.  We also like the Chia Seed Parfaits as a dessert.  Their Chicken and Wild rice soup was just okay.  I particularly like their seasonal blueberry lemonade.   So far we have not had anything we did not like and prices are reasonable. We are definitely new fans and its nice to support a local valley business. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"THE BEST salad drive thru EVER. I'm from Los Angeles and was visiting my sister who swore this salad drive thru was YUUUUUUUMY and healthy. Reluctantly tried it and ended up eating the Power Wrap twice a day for the week I was there....I know...I'm ridiculous.  Fast forward 2 months later, here I am doing the exact same thing. One exception....tonight I got there 13 minutes too late and was soooooooo desperate for my wrap that I got out of my car and knocked on the window and shamelessly begged them to make me one. I would've paid extra....that's how bad I was craving it. The manager Chloe and employee Alyssa didn't hesitate and happily (yes, happily) made it for me! THANK YOU SO MUCH - you gals ROCK!!!!  During this season of giving thanks to those who go over and beyond, no matter how big or small the deed, this definitely makes the list:-) The term \"paying it forward\" may seem like a cliche to some, but do it anyway....pay it forward. Thanks again, Chloe and Alyssa, for doing something so nice for me.   For those who've never tried this place, please do...your tummy will thank you:-)"}
{"text":"Service here is excellent and so is the food. Loved the caesar salad and the peanut butter and chocolate smoothie. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love salads for lunch and I'm fussy, so this place is great. Cobb salad + chicken with the poblano Cesar dressing (hold the onions) and mix it all up is my standard order. Love it. See you there."}
{"text":"Food was great, I ordered two Cobb salads and a tea, everything was delicious. I only gave four stars because the drive thru wait time was pretty long, just a little under 25 mins long. Also they forgot my drink, I will definitely go back, maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"I couldn't find the location. I drove all around this area and could not find it or see any signs for it. I tried calling but the number went to an automated voice message that didn't provide any assistance. It was annoying."}
{"text":"OMG my new FAVORITE place to eat for a quick lunch, I have always wondered why there was not a healthy drive thru option, most peoples response to me was \"yuck\" and \"it would never last\". I have been there twice since it opened and it was fast, friendly and the food was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Very good place to go for a quick bit to eat. Not the same old fast food. Very creative salads, friendly staff. Don't sleep on the Pot Pie soup. I'll Be Back..."}
{"text":"i had a somewhat complicated order (NOT)... the guy taking my order at the drive thru window didn't repeat what i had ordered so i was hopeful everything came out correct. well it wasn't. i ordered a bbq ranch and a cobb wrap and got the cobb and an asian wrap. when i told the guy at the window my order was wrong, he began to argue with me about what i had ordered which was totally rude & uncalled for. he also practically threw the bags of food at me. just bad customer service all around... the wraps were poorly made and falling apart. i'm glad i don't normally eat here !"}
{"text":"I'm in love. A place I can get a tasty salad without getting out of the car. NICE! But what was 5 stars all the way is the Pina Colado shake. OMG! I was in pineapple coconut heaven. I might have another one tomorrow."}
{"text":"First time trying this place it was delicious. I really recommended this place if you want a health meal or if your just craving a good salad or wrap."}
{"text":"I LOVE the chia pudding! It has fresh fruit on top and the texture is really creamy! The service is always fast and friendly :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a quick salad. Everything is fresh. I can order exactly what I want according to my diet preferences.  The staff is always friendly and efficient. I wish there was more locations. Thanks for the good healthy salads."}
{"text":"By far the best salads and vegan chili in the valley! The southwest salad at is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"First time going here there was some confusion and I got a breakfast burrito with bacon and it didn't taste cooked... But I stuck it out and now I get the breakfast (warm Berry quinoa bowl) from here almost everyday. the staff is always friendly and helpful. Tried the smoothie for the first Time & it is delicious! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I'm revising my review to full 5 stars! Someone must have read my previous review about the poor customer service because both my husband and myself have actually noticed a difference in the attitudes of the employees at multiple locations several consecutive times now. So happy with company! Thank you for providing fresh delicious healthy food!    5 stars for a healthy drive thru option 2 stars on customer service. Employees are just never super friendly and act like this is absolutely the last place they want to be, which we've noticed to be true for a couple different locations in Gilbert, AZ. But the food IS healthy and tasty so we keep coming back. Also, we're another vote to open a location in Veg"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! All of their salads are super fresh and huge!!! I love the caprese salad! The smoothies are a little watery and the service is a little slow, but the staff is really friendly!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of a drive thru salad joint. The thought and care that went into designing it was obvious. After a few trips though, I found that even after adding protein to my salads I just wasn't satisfied. The food is quality and the staff friendly and the menu is great."}
{"text":"This was the worst salad I have ever had. Nothing tasted or looked fresh, the tofu was gross (I am vegan) and it seemed like it was just sitting in the fridge all day. I felt sick after eating it.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Love these guys. Wish there were more locations. Prices are amazi g. Super fresh and friendly service."}
{"text":"Skip the soup.. This soup is awful. You can not taste any broccoli the only thing you can taste is pepper and onion.  Roasted Chicken & Broccoli /Broccoli, Chicken, Mushrooms, Carrots,/ Celery, Red Potatoes, & Onions /GF 190 calories, 1.5g sat fat, 17g protein, 22g carbs, 4g fiber.."}
{"text":"Super good food. I always get the Greek salad with steak and there organic ice coffee drive-through is really fast"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, friendly service, always fresh super interesting recipes.  Love the nutritional information being available.  This place is my go to for healthy but lazy meals."}
{"text":"Love love love this place my favorite jalapeño ranch with chicken salad and I love their lemonade watermelon and cucumber I think they could have more variety but it's a good start. I eat here 2 to 3 times a week."}
{"text":"I love all the options. The seasonal menus are great. The service is fast. They recently got rid of the root beer, which is disappointing, but the lemonade is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great fresh greens added chicken. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Forgot a few things no big deal as we ate on the patio."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out!  I never eat at fast food places because they gross me out.  The only places I will ever go is Chick Fil A, and In N Out, but now i can add Salad and Go to the list!  It was delicious and super convenient.  My 3 year old ate half of my salad as well!  He loved it.  I love that they are totally organic and totally fresh.  I had The Greek Salad this time and it was yum.  I am anxious to try out another item.  I hope this place not only stays in business, but thrives, so that we can have more opportunities to eat at Salad and Go where it is convenient, but healthy."}
{"text":"Can I say Freekin Amazing!! It's a drive through or order inside establishment. Service super fast, prices very reasonable. Food is so fresh, and the creative combinations of ingredients tantalize the pallet. It was my first time, and OMG they did not disappoint. It's been forever since I've had a salad this good.  I ordered the butternut squash & quinoa salad with chicken, a chicken pot pie soup, and cucumber mint lemonade. 5 stars across the board I would not change a thing."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ingredients are always fresh and they always make a point to be personable. The only downfall they have is they don't cut their cherry tomatoes anymore and every time I bite into one it explodes tomato juice all over my clothes."}
{"text":"More game than Nintendo! That's right, this place has salads that can satisfy even manly palates.  Dare I say try the caesar salad wrap? Packed with wholesome goodness that soothes the hunger of burly Lumberjacks (at least that's what those guys in front of me in line looked like).  Lots of healthy choices here. Glad to see they are innovating to people who are concerned with convenient, tasty, and healthy meals.  Five stars. Deal with it!"}
{"text":"Love love love, and so excited a new location is opening by my house...well, could be dangerous. This is perfect for healthy living on the go.   Went for dinner & got a 2nd salad for lunch the next day. They are huge! Very fresh & filling. Tried the Greek & Caprese, both with gardein...good choice.   The warm quinoa bowl or the banana kale smoothie are also good pics for a quick breakfast.   Service is quick & friendly. Love that they support locally, like Bergies for coffee. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I just got home after spending $43 dollars there. One of our salads has no chicken and both of our turkey and cheese only wraps are missing the cheese!!!   And seriously they don't even answer their effing phone?!?!   I was charged for all of the above.   I frequent S and G often but will definitely not in the future."}
{"text":"New favorite post-workout food! Their strawberry, sweet potato and quinoa salad wrap is to die for!!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly here every other day for lunch. Everything I've tried is delicious and the staff is always friendly. It's the perfect alternative to fast food restaurants! I get the seasonal lemonade (regardless of the season it always tastes good) and a Southwest Caesar wrap with chicken."}
{"text":"I eat here probably three times a week at least. I love the BBQ ranch salad with chicken but I sub the BBQ ranch dressing with the low fat ranch to save calories and fat and I prefer the taste of the low fat ranch. Its so yummy! I also love the breakfast smoothie and the Chia seed breakfast parfait! My only complaint about the salads is at times there is too much lettuce and not enough of the other ingredients but you can't really complain about something like that because then you'll run the risk of not getting enough lettuce so I just deal with it. Also I wish some of the breakfast items had less sugar and fewer calories. 500 to 700 calories for breakfast is a lot. They should really think about redoing some of the breakfast item ingredients so they are more calorie conscious and less sugary.  Overall I love this place and am so happy there is one right down the road from me.  I appreciate the response but I still think the sugar content and calories could and should be reduced by eliminating some of the extra ingredients. Also I never claimed that you added sugar. I realize its in the coconut, pecans, raisins etc...nonetheless I'll still be treating myself to the higher calorie breakfast options every now and then. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm familiar with their Gilbert location and love being able to do drive thru and not have to order a burger! Not sure how they do what they do in such a small little kitchen, but it works. What they do best is service. No matter which location.. the staff working there are polite and sweet. This north location has a guy that really sticks out but I haven't caught his name. Worked the drive thru closing shift 9/2/16. Fast food salad. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"I could not be happier this place exists.  The salads aren't that expensive, which I was expecting it to be since it's fresh. And the portions? are huge! The first time my husband and I went we got our own and couldn't finish them. So we share them now. We've tried a few and man, they are good.  Their worth stopping by. Go. Go now."}
{"text":"Super convenient drive through for a healthy fast food option. Love their Cobb salad and the lime vinaigrette dressing too. Smoothies and fresh juices are delicious and they have refreshing lemonades, too."}
{"text":"Well, this is quite a story. I had pulled up to the Jack in the Box, and was walking up to it when I glanced across the road to see the word SALAD. I think someone was trying to tell me something! So back into my vehicle I go and cross the road. I don't do drive thru's as my order is never right and I also feel like I am on the spot for having to order so quickly. Anyways I get there and walk up to view the menu. I heard the man in front of me order a salad and the chicken corn chowder soup, so my turn next, I ordered the chowder soup and BBQ Ranch Salad with extra dressing on the side. As someone else had mentioned, no need to order extra dressing as there is plenty on the salad, which incidentally was fantastic as was the soup!!! The service was super fast even with the drive-thru being packed. I will definitely be going back. Can't wait to try all the other salads and wraps etc."}
{"text":"Great salads that are really like two meals! All the ingredients fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I happen to be on a different side of town than usual for lunch today and decided to drive through this place on my way back to work. First of all, I was impressed with how fast I got through the drive-thru, around 3 minutes. I was in a colossal hurry and honestly thought it would take a lot longer but decided to try anyways because the line was short. I got the Asian salad in a wrap with the dressing mixed in and shrimp. It was delicious, the shrimp was perfect. I plan on coming back with my kids and I'm hoping they will like the kids menu and this to become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always consistent, fresh, and delicious. The staff is friendly and I'm just so thankful for this place."}
{"text":"So good, always fresh. Staff is happy and helpful. Long drive try lines go by super quickly. One recommendation: make jalapeño ranch a year-round thing!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre salads!! Ordered a Santa Fe chicken salad. Chicken was very dry. Ordered an organic lemonade with mint and cucumber (there was no mint or cucumber)!! Wouldn't eat her again."}
{"text":"LITERALLY, is this a joke? Lol? Read my previous review. I digress.   3 coworkers of mine have gone to this location on their lunch break and have had something wrong with their order.. 3 coworkers last week, ALL of them had something missing or wrong!   This is as comical as it is annoying AF. Comeeee onnnnn, guys, it's SALAD! I love the concept, but please, just listen and make sure you get it correct. And please make sure there's no more bugs in salads (previous reviews I've read.) thank you."}
{"text":"I tried their Mexican type salad with jalapeño dressing shortly after they first opened. Very disappointing. Lots of lettuce with very few veggies and chicken. Dressing was bland. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"They gave me salmonella and e-coli poisoning. And tried to give me a 20 dollar gift card to \"try it again\" how about you try to pay for the 1700 dollar antibiotics!!!!!!! #goodbyesaladandgo"}
{"text":"Salad and Go is truly doing it right! The quality of the food and the service is like nothing else out there! Offering us all the options you do is exactly what we needed! Healthy on the go!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads, soups and wraps! I always decide what I want from the regular menu but end up ordering from the Seasonal Menu once there! I wish you would open in Downtown Mesa on Main Street! Today's blueberry, quinoa, cranberry and feta and greens salad was delicious as was the chicken corn chowder soup and Blueberry Rosemary Lemonade! Thank you for yummy and healthy food in a flash!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Everyone that works there is always so energetic and kind! A friend recommend this place and I can't stop going back. Service is quick, the food is delicious, and the price can't be beat! Only downside- they need more locations!!!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I started going there when they first opened, and it was a MISS !!!  I know they were new, but they could not get an order right, and nobody was in line, one guy came out to talk to me at the drive up speaker, he was rude, the salad concept appeals to me 1 because a salad made by anyone else tastes better than I make, mostly because of no clean up (I do make a wicked ceaser salad and my own special concoctions) I would have paid their prices in a heart beat on a weekly if not twice a week regeim, but they were rude, the salads were inconsistent, and they were just plain rude.  good news is I go now and again, and my leave now before they close at 9pm... but I pay cash because I don't trust them with knowing who I am, I went on their site and talked to them in the begining, and they were just nasty... I am over that , but I don't forget, when I am hungry and paying for food,I like service, I don't like losing my appetite, they often forget one item or another , but I check, They kinda  have an attitude for it, but hey I pay for it I should get it.  anyhow it is the same price as a salad at Mc donalds and I don't have to get out of my car on a hot summer day so I get one about once every 3 months. too bad they didn't give me service or respect, I really would be there weekly I am a vegitarian.\   I get their smoothies so wicked good, and so wickedly over priced, but I have an over abundance of cash LOL (NOT)     It is almost 9 pm.. what to do?  I went, the food is good. I  will be back and hope no more  drama arises!"}
{"text":"First of all it would be great if you answered your phone...I've tried 3 times and have gotten no answer. We got a build your own wrap with turkey cheese and ranch. I'm attaching the receipt to the other message I sent you along with my phone number. We were already too far away when we realized it was all lettuce and a half slice of turkey...no cheese and no ranch. I want a refund. Who pays $8.50 for lettuce and a tortilla."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Salads are off the charts. Have tried the BBQ Ranch, Santa Fe, Louie and Asian salads while in town awhile back and all were amazing. Not only the best \"fast-food\" salads I've ever had, they are quite possibly some of the best salads I've ever had, and I am a bit of a foodie. They filled me up while making me feel really good and healthy about what I was eating. The greens and veggies were fresh and crisp, the local fresh farmer's cheese in the BBQ Ranch was amazing - so creamy, really made the salad into something different. The dressings were all unique and flavorful - definitely not dressings I would be able to whip up at home. These are very much high-end restaurant quality salads but at great prices -- and in a drive-thru! Just amazing. It was so good that I continue to think about and crave it, months later. Definitely will be going back on my next trip to Gilbert. I hope they expand nationally and bring a location near everyone, it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I am doing my best to eat healthy, but finding a place on the go that is healthy is difficult.  I ordered the Caprese with prawns, dressing on the side.  I got a delicious pesto dressing and a balsamic vinaigrette. I only used half of each and it was probably the best salad I've had in a long time.  It was the perfect ratio of everything.  I highly recommend this place to anyone that is trying to eat right!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmy I love the Cobb wrap so healthy and so many great ingredients bacon , hard boiled eggs,  avocado and much more. It is so great to know I can get fast food that is great tasting but more important very healthy. Fast drive thru too"}
{"text":"I love salad and go, unfortunately this one seemed to lack care and quality. The salad I got was the BBQ ranch salad, as I always do, and my salad came out half full with mushy beans and lettuce that was wilted with red spots. Never coming back to this one!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. I was visiting my boyfriend's family in Gilbert this weekend and I decided to stop here on my way home. The food was AMAZING and the employees were fantastic! I'd give y'all 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time a week ago and then went for a second time today. I absolutely adore this place! Eating healthy is so hard when you're busy, but this place is a game changer! In the past I will occasionally order salads to be healthy, but I don't enjoy it. These salads are the best I've ever had! I tried their Cobb salad and their seasonal roasted Brussels sprouts and bacon. There is a perfect amount of each ingredient mixed in! The dressing is just a cherry on top because I could honestly eat these salads without dressing (which I have never said before about a salad ever! That's how flavorful the salads are!) Please open up one of these in Tempe ASAP! This is going to be the only fast food I get when I'm in the area!  I'd give it bonus stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I got the seasonal harvest salad without cheese and it was soo good. I love this place. Thank goodness there is finally a place that has healthy fast food. I have been waiting for years. This salad was big too and filled me up. I got the balsamic vinaigrette because it was vegan and overall I was very happy. Thanks! The only bad thing is the location: because its in between/nearby farms it smells bad outside where you eat (no inside dining option here) so I recommend to take it to-go."}
{"text":"I love having this as a healthy option that is convenient and quick. The salad is fresh and delicious, also quite big so you're getting what you pay for! I love the southwest salad, I get it every time.  The only thing I do not like is the chai lattes, well I like the taste just not the price for such a small amount of liquid that's wedged in between ice. I have asked for light ice and they gave me the cup with a lot of space and about half the drink, they said they make the recipe for a certain size every time and that the ice has no effect. So I won't be purchasing those anymore since it's basically a rip off. My sister has gotten the smoothie and let's just say I'll stick to my own home made smoothies!  I probably won't try anything else unless my kid wants to, but the salad is great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It literally changed my life. I ate this food almost every day last year and lost almost 50 lbs. Exercise played a part also but the healthy fast food lunch option was crucial in my success. (fyi, they have Sri Racha you just have to ask for it)"}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ and found this little gem! I love the concept and after trying it I love the food. I ordered the cobb salad with shrimp on top. Fresh ingredients, great dressings, you really can't go wrong. I will definitely be back to try all their varieties! Highly recommended! Fast food is now healthy!"}
{"text":"So happy this place is finally here. Me and my family have visited quite a few times and it has been wonderful each time. The wait can be a little long but it's not like there is employees sitting around playing on their phones, twiddling thumbs. I have seen them through the window-HUSTLING trying to be the quickest they can be and i appreciate you guys. EXCEPTIONAL customer service. I think it's silly how people are complaining about the sizes and prices. These are very generous sizes in my opinion. I usually can only eat half at a time and to say they are overpriced?? Did you know they use organic and local ingredients? I saw that is an AMAZING price for what you get. My favorite is the Greek salad super yummy. Me and my husband will continue to send people your way and congrats on doing so well! #supportlocalbusinesses"}
{"text":"I was driving on the other side of town with my baby sleep and saw this spot. This was well deserving of my money. The salad was a nice size portion and was delicious. I would love to see this place flourish and hopefully one get built closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"Please try this place out!! Delicious salad, wrap, and soup options for such reasonable prices!! The young lady was super helpful at the drive thru and had my order ready in one minute!!! Fast, efficient, affordable, courteous, and YUMMY! Ordered the Asian salad with chicken, chicken Cobb wrap, and pot pie soup! Everybody was very happy with their choices! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My young children and I have eaten here twice since they've opened. We absolutely LOVE the kale smoothie and have had several salads that we will definitely be back for. The salads are huge and can feed my kids for dinner and lunch the next day. The only reason for the 4-star rating is that the produce is not organic."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and they forgot the forks. Common sense to give people forks with their SALAD!!!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious and fresh!! Employees are very friendly and provide great customer service!!!! They get our order right EVERY TIME!!!!! The pea protein is a great addition for the smoothies!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING A SALAD AND GO TO NORTH SCOTTSDALE!!!!! WE LOVE SALAD AND GO!!!"}
{"text":"I finally managed to make it over to this place last Friday and Ive already been back. I'm hooked on the Cobb salad. Got once with chicken and once with steak. Both were delicious!! The servers are extremely nice and for having my salads customized I was in and out of there incredibly fast! The salad is so big it was about three meals for me! Love it. Don't know what took me so long but I will be a weekly regular. I'll have to try some different salads next time."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've always longed for a healthy fast food option and now I've found it!!  I freaking love this place! They have their standard menu with options that can be made as a salad or wrap (you can add animal or vegan protein), smoothies, breakfast menu and an all day breakfast menu. Then they have a rotating seasonal menu with a salad, soups, smoothie and lemonade. Oh right, their fresh made lemonades are so good!!  Right now the seasonal salad (greens, beets, sweet potatoes, feta cheese, candied pecans, dried cranberries, champagne vinaigrette) and smoothie (pumpkin, chai spices, almond milk, banana, carrots) are my jam! But I also dig their Asian salad and the Greek as a wrap. Mmmm so good, getchu some!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! One of my favorites places to eat it's clean they are very affordable friendly and fast .."}
{"text":"I stop early in the morning to grab a salad for lunch and coffee for my commute to work. Salads are tasty and reasonably priced, coffee is good but could be hotter. No complaints about drive thru they are fast. I will continue to frequent business if prices are not raised. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat something fresh, I didn't have time to waste, and this was the perfect spot. Salad in a drive thru! I got the BBQ ranch with chicken and the Asian salad with chicken. I loved the BbQ ranch, I thought the Asian wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but my Dad thought it was great. so we ended up winning on both salads!   The dressings had a sophisticated taste in a simple flavor. The simple flavor of BBQ and ranch combined with a sense of complexity that gives the BBQ ranch salad a gourmet taste, while still being a flavor of comfort.    All the veggies were fresh and crisp and the chicken was free range, which always makes me feel better about the food I put in my body.    I wish there was a Salad and go in my neighborhood because I'm barely ever in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today.  We both got the citrus pomegranate salad with grilled chicken and the blueberry rosemary lemonade.   It was seriously delicious and fresh--none of that cheap white lettuce.  Everything was fresh and green, which I love.  My only complaint--and it is a big one--is the price.  It was $25 for drive-thru food for two people.  That is pretty crazy.  We would love to try other items on the menu, but this will have to be an occasional takeout option.  We have five people in our family, and we cannot afford upwards of $50 for drive-thru salads on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Overall pretty satisfied with the salad. The drive thru was long and wrapped around the building, but it moved fairly quickly. I like that the salads are priced without protein and you can add if you want. I ordered the BBQ Ranch without tortilla strips and got an extra side of dressing. Once ordering the line moved even faster. One thing that kind of irked me was the girl gave me my salad in the bag, and the salad turned on it's side. I don't know that I had a reason to be irked because the salad was fine, possibly better from getting jostled haha. I opened up the salad and it looked nothing like the images online. I'd say presentation is better from a McDonalds salad. The pico that comes with the salad was much too oniony for my taste so I picked the onions out. There was a piece of cheese that was covered in brown, looked a bit moldy so I tossed that. I really liked the dressing and definitely glad I ordered an extra side since the salad is pretty good size. I think I'd go back, but definitely not raving about it."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, fast food that's healthy ... great idea these need to be in other states. The breakfast shake is delicious.... I'm Not a big fan of the meat they use."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  It was good food and service.  Mgr Anthony was very kind and professional.  Was busy and the service was still very fast.  Was surprised to see a drive thru."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish it was closer. I get the same salad every time and it is very consistent."}
{"text":"I was okay with this place the first couple times I went, but I'm not too sure anymore after getting home with my food today. I decided to add steak to my wrap and it doesn't taste fresh at all. I don't know, it could be the quality of the meat too. It had a strong old taste to it. And the first time I went I got chicken added to my salad and that didn't taste fresh either. I picked it out and ate my food anyway because I was so hungry. I'm kind of turned off now and probably won't be back. I'm so sick of wasting money when I go out to eat. Why is it so hard to have good quality fresh food?!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The salads are great and very inexpensive. Service was so fast and there was no line! Ingredients were fresh and a good amount of everything.   My one complaint is that I ordered the BBQ ranch salad with steak and instead got chicken. Not a big deal, but the steak does cost more."}
{"text":"I got the salad of the month which is the roasted brussel sprout salad with bacon, almonds, apples & the champagne vinegarette. The salad was very good. Since the dressing is on the side you can easily split the large portion & rationalize the $8 (after tax & without protein) salad as 2 of the four meals you should be eating a day. I see some people had issue with the one cup  of dressing for the large size which I have to disagree with. At least the way I approach all salad dressings as just that. The ingredients should shine through & the dressing is just that a dressing & not an ingredient. But that's just me. Most people don't enjoy the taste of their leafy greens but I do. These were fresh ingredients, nice knife cuts, diff textures & were delish. The Greek is going to be my go to I'm sure but I really enjoyed my January salad of the month.  Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"They have great seasonal salads even with sweet potatoes ! We really liked the menu and drive thru service. The place is all brand new with great curb appeal as well. The salad ingredients were very fresh and high quality"}
{"text":"I dig this place. Super fresh and it's quick. Also the hours are pretty solid. Cheap too! It'll fill you up. Only problem is that it's a little far out there, so a bit of drive to get there. I also love the calorie count is included on their menu. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love the freshness of this place. The staff here is the best. Miss the Jalapeño Ranch but the Southwest Caesar is still a favorite of mine right along with the Cobb. Recommend this place if you want a healthy alternative to the fast food rut."}
{"text":"The best drive thru! I will stop on my way to work and grab lunch, it's always a quick trip and delicious! My coworkers are always jealous to see that orange container!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a quick healthy bite to eat. Salads always taste like they were just chopped! I love how they have the macronutrients posted right on the menu. Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place and was so excited to see one open up at Alma School and Southern! I did the drive through but you can also walk up and sit at tables on a patio. The salads are all under $6 and they are huge. I loved the sweet potato strawberry salad. I went to another Mesa location at lunch time. There was a line of cars but it was so fast getting in and out. They have a nice selection of salads that you can make a wrap instead, breakfast foods, and a kids menu. There is also a separate seasonal menu posted at the drive through that is not online. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"If I could give the company 10 stars I would! Delicious, affordable, large selection and size of salads with plenty of options for proteins. I used to frequent here weekly when I lived in AZ and am super bummed that there is no Salad and Gos in FL because the only fast food in the south is fried. I hope this company continues to grow and share it's vision! I love you guys and always stop by when I'm home for the holidays! Thanks for making healthy easy!"}
{"text":"Great concept and quick service. The food was fresh and tasty. I would recommend this for on the go lunchers."}
{"text":"Decided to test this place out today and all I can say is I should have came here sooner! What a great idea. I ordered two salads, both were larger then I expected and service was great. I'm looking forward to trying more options and their soon to be open sister Meals and Go option. Finally a welcoming change for the area vs fast food."}
{"text":"I love the concept of a fast-food restaurant that's healthy! I've ordered a number of the salads: BBQ ranch, Asian, southwest, to name a few! Haven't tasted any of their sandwiches but I have enjoyed all of the salads I've tried. I took a star off because I would have preferred more meat to make this a more filling meal. Overall, love ordering from here; only wish there were locations closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Great healthy option that is really fast! Pretty inexpensive with ability to customize everything. Definitely will try it again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Salads are so yummy and fresh! They are so sweet about customizing food to your own liking! The smoothies are super yummy too!! I love that you can drive thru and eat healthy!! I love to visit salad and go!! Go try it out!!"}
{"text":"Love the option of a healthy and fast meal. Mostly that its fresh and tasty! Very affordable to go 2 or 3 times a week! Thanks for coming to surprise! Keep up the quality  ..."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life? I would love a Salad and Go on every corner. No longer is limited time an excuse to make poor dietary choices.  Enough of my rant...tried this place for the first time today and already know I'm going back tomorrow. Mr. and I shared a breakfast wrap that was packed with great breakfast flavors such as savory bacon and seasoned potatoes paired with greens and pico de gallo. Truly a breakfast of champions. I also purchased a salad for lunch (to be eaten later) and am impressed with the quality of the ingredients awaiting me.  Quick and friendly service as well"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday with an intense Salad craving. I got the strawberry and sweet potato salad and it was perfection. If my review was based on that alone it would be five stars. The rest of my order is where things got messy. Or rather dry. My wife and sister both ordered wraps and ordered them with the dressing on the side. Now I could understand messing up the order and tossing with dressing I guess but a fast food restaurant that specializes in salads basically serves 2 functions. 1) Make salad. 2) dress salad. Now I would understand if someone ordered a wrap or salad without dressing, I'm sure that's a thing but in this case we did not. It's definitely not the most convenient location unless you live in the neighborhood but I do not so by the time I made it home and noticed it was too late. Alas these wraps were to be enjoyed with store bought generic dressing on an otherwise perfect tornado of fresh veggie goodness. Shame really. I'll probably give it one more shot... Maybe?"}
{"text":"Very nice people, I would almost do business with them solely on how nice the guys were especially at 730am! but hey the salad is what I went for and what I was craving at the time and it was how I wanted it and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Love the food but caution if you want an exception (ie:no onion etc). Three times I have gotten my food with onion, twice they forgot the cheese..... And I am not even going when they are busy...would do better if they listened, guess I will have to do like I do McDonalds-always check before I drive off."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to trying this place. A couple hours after I hate the Asian chicken salad I had extremely uncomfortable stomach pains and was throwing up. Pretty positive this place gave me food poisoning because I had not previously eaten anything significant to out my under the weather like that."}
{"text":"Second time going close to my last time going.  Requested that my Mixed Greens and Apple salad be tossed and this is the second time it has not been done.  MAKES ME WONDER IF THE SALADS ARE PREMADE.  Are they sacrificing fast service for customer service? I will give them one more try.  Can not contact via phone number just a recording...."}
{"text":"I love the salad here!! It is always super fresh and tasty. I've never been sorry for stopping!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here even though I work nearby, my wife told me about it and we tried it Monday night.   Incredible, delicious, fresh, fast, friendly, lots of options, and $5.74 for any salad or wrap (protein is $1.40 more- very reasonable). Servings are huge. Calories and diet info is posted on all items.  I have been here for lunch every day this week, creature of habit so I am stuck for now on the BBQ Ranch wrap because it is just so delicious its hard to believe it is healthy eating.  So happy a place like this opened up nearby (for me), what a great concept."}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am enjoying a SALAD and GO for the very first time. I Chose a Cob Salad with Shrimp. It has amazing flavors, and tastes very fresh. It is indeed, one of the best. I don't know how they can make everything taste so good, but they do. Shrimp, hard boiled egg, bacon bits, avocado, blu cheese, and romaine lettuce. I really like how fresh everything tastes.  Great idea! No more greasy drive thru for me. I plan to make better choices now."}
{"text":"Tried this little gem for the first time today. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Food is healthy and fresh. The salads are made to order and super fast!  Prices are great too!  I will definitely be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I don't usually do free marketing for restaurants. BUT. Salad n Go is becoming my favorite lunch spot. Which is serious because you guys know I love my food.   I've never had a bad salad from here, actually their salads have only gotten better with more toppings and options now than before. They also keep their seasonal menu rotating with yummy stuff.   Now offering small kids meals for everyone, not just kids, in case you want a drive thru healthy snack instead of some basket o' fries.  They also lowered their prices for fresh salads. This mean more people can have access to fresh produce and healthy eats! Their new location in my hood at Scottsdale and Oak is awesome - you won't regret your visit!"}
{"text":"I went to the new Salad and Go on Higley and Williams Field Rd. It just opened a couple of weeks ago and was excited to see what it was all about. I ordered the cobb salad and was very disappointed. First there was lots of lettuce and it looked clean and fresh. However the rest of the ingredients were very much lacking: eggs, blue cheese crumbles (almost none), bacon (chopped so fine and spooned on to) and 1 very tiny slice of avocado. There were lots of tomatoes. Since I didn't open it until I got home I was pleasantly surprised at the size. That being said they gave one little container of water downed blue cheese dressing. No way would it have dressed the entire salad. I was willing to pay the $5.69 for the salad but did not get my money's worth with the extra ingredients for sure. I will go back and order a different salad to see if I can get a 5 star salad next time. I would certainly look closely at the list of ingredients and compare it to what you actually get."}
{"text":"Just recently found this place right up the street from my office. Love the fact that it has a drive through so I can just go through and head back to the office with my food. So far I have had the roasted sweet potato and strawberry salad and today I am trying the special they had of roasted vegetable and spring greens and a cucumber mint lemonade. My fave so far is the roasted sweet potato salad. The dressing was sweet and tangy, but not overwhelming and the sweet potatoes were tender with just enough bite left for great texture. My salad today is good too. It has an aromatic basil vinaigrette and roasted beets, carrots, and tomatoes with feta cheese and I added chicken. The lemonade is so tasty and refreshing! This is going to be a favorite place to go for lunch from now on! I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"These salads are no joke they are so big and delicious you can tell everything is fresh me and my husband go all the time when we want a light dinner they're always really pleasant to talk to and fast."}
{"text":"Hungry? Looking for a healthy meal? Too lazy to get out of the car? This is the place for you! They have hearty salads that are delicious and filling. Great for the veggie folks out there..they have gardein chicken you can add to the salads which I do every time. I even like the option of getting them in a wrap, but they do get a little soggy at the end sometimes. Great place for healthy \"fast food\""}
{"text":"Love this place! Great, fresh, delicious salads at a drive thru with unbeatable prices!? Can we get 100 in the Bay Area please?"}
{"text":"I wish there were more of these restaurants. So good. Fresh and fast. They just need to add fresh fruits"}
{"text":"Seriously LOVE THIS PLACE. I've been here twice and I've loved it every time. Salad is fresh and delicious! I'm sooo happy to have found a drive through salad place when I don't want to eat junk food! Plenty of salad options. Great size for a great price!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Arizona and I'm in love with this place. I got a Greek salad with chicken substitute and it is amazing! I love how I don't have to go just get greasy fast food , I can go to a healthy place and get a nice salad.  Will be coming here ALOT"}
{"text":"Excellent  Great salads made to order with all quality ingredients  Romaine lettuce with strawberries,candied sweet potatoes,quinoa,blue cheese crumbles and bay shrimp  Great choice of dressings Numerous other combos and wraps  Wife loved it"}
{"text":"Yum!! These salads are so so good! Talk about a great fast way to eat healthy. I loved the sweet potatoes and strawberry salad. The staff was super friendly since it was my first time eating there. They were quick to share the most popular salad. I am craving the salad again!"}
{"text":"I love this place for \"fast food.\" Is it the greatest salad and smoothie of all time? No. But for $4.50 for a smoothie, vs. $8 at a local smoothie place or even $6.50 at Jamba which is a huge corporate chain - you really can't beat how awesome this place is! The drive thru line is speedy quick and it's a great concept.   In response to the person who posted a bug in their salad and 1 star, because that kind of amazed me - bugs are in vegetables which you may have noticed when you wash them at home. If you found a rubber band in your salad, that would be cause for concern. A bug is just nature... really not a huge deal in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love Salad and Go! Healthy delicious food on the fly. The best drive-through in Surprise! Very friendly staff & fast service. Have loved every single thing I've tried off the menu!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of a drive-through salad place.  Although there were many cars ahead of me the wait was not long at all.  The salad was good but it was just a salad. No better than any other good salad.  I would go back.  There's a few chairs outside if you want to eat your salad there but it's strictly a to go place"}
{"text":"So looked forward to trying this unique venue today, since my friends rave about it! Well disappointed they are not willing to accommodate folks with food allergies! Simply asked that the banana be removed from the mango colada smoothie to no avail! Seems since the banana was right on top of the cut up fruit, this would have been a quick fix prior to mixing into a smoothie! No manager on duty to take this matter up with today! The young man tending the window did not use common sense, in my humble opinion! No need for my business apparently!"}
{"text":"Salad N GO is my favorite fast food !! I love the concept and they are constantly trying different menu items .Make sure you look at menu before you go they have tons of salads ! The staff is very friendly and personable!"}
{"text":"This place is great for when you don't feel like making lunch/dinner and your in a rush but don't want the typical fast food. Staff is usually pretty friendly (I've only ran into a dud like once) and the food is always good! Great size wrap and salads. Sometimes the chicken is rubbery, but what fast food doesn't have that? Also if you order dressing on the side always make sure to check your bag before you leave, most of the time they forget."}
{"text":"Really really good, yet good for you too!  I was hesitant when my wife suggested we go here since I wasn't really in the mood for \"healthy food,\" but it was great!  We had the santa fe and southwestern caesar salads as wraps for lunch.  Delicious!  This will definitely be our go-to spot for a quick bite.  The map location is wrong though.  It's on Williams Field and Higley, not WF and Power."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, crispy salads for a great price! I am a very healthy eater and sometimes when I'm too lazy to cook, I come here and grab some grub to go. The Greek salad with chicken in a tortilla wrap is my favorite and I love the chia seed parfait so much that I always buy 2 whenever I'm there. Staff is super fast and super friendly. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I've heard people raving about this place! Everything is supposed to be fresh and savory. I happened to be in the area so I decided to give it a try. It was about 5pm on a weekday and the drive thru line was packed. I took that as a good side and was excited to order. I decided to try the southwest salad and add chicken. The order process was fast and efficient. Drive in. Order. Drive out. I paid a little over 7 dollars and rushed home to eat. There are a few things that bothered me. There were way too many chick peas. It was overwhelming and I felt I couldn't taste much of anything else. This was basically a wrapped salad with chick peas and beets. Not much else I could taste. There was definitely no chicken either. Disappointed about my first experience and the amount of money I spent. Hope I'm impressed another time."}
{"text":"This is my \"Caprese Salad\" place. This salad is so delicious that I have no desire for any other! They got some really great drinks and smoothies too. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"So nice to have a fresh healthy drive thru around here. Didn't feel like burgers or fast food Mexican we wanted salads so what a great place! I got the BBQ steak salad. My husband got the chicken Asian salad. Both salads prepared quickly and fresh! We will be back to try some different combos! Their menu has alot to offer!"}
{"text":"I had the Greek salad wrap with no meat or tofu and it was to die for! Loved it!! So glad to have found this place, will definitely will go back. And I am very happy to find a good place to eat that isn't the same ol mexican/Italian food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and had one of the worst experiences ever. They forgot about my order and after waiting for 10 minutes in the waiting area, they asked me what I ordered. If that was the only problem, then no big deal.......but then came the salad. All looked ok, but after I mixed the salad, I found a large piece of plastic in the salad, several inches long by a few inches wide. I waited at the window to bring this to their attention and was ignored for maybe another 30 to 45 seconds. I decided for a refund and to skip lunch. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"While the concept is great, drive thru healthy food, the outcome stinks.  A few of us at my job tried them for lunch.  Every salad was wrong.  We all paid the extra $$ for chicken which was all of 4 tiny pieces, each salad was missing something it was supposed to come with, the salad is 99% lettuce and not much else.  It would be cheaper to just make a salad at home.  None of us were impressed and won't be going back.  I gave two stars because I like the idea."}
{"text":"Damn. Love this place Just had the special salad, butternut squash with quinoa. FREAKIN AMAZING!  Never had a bad meal here and a salad in under $8.  Do yourself a favor and eat here"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE salad and go! We recently moved to Gilbert from Chicago and are always looking for healthy places to eat. We were told about Salad and Go by a friend and the food is delicious! You may not know what they serve just by looking at it from the outside but their menu has lots of freshly made-to-order salad options, smoothies, wraps and even a kids menu. I love their breakfast bowls. My husband and I eat here at least a few times a week. The prices are SO reasonable as well. Everyone who works there is so friendly as well. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our walk for smoothies. Server is super nice. Smoothies are delish and we personally saw them drop fruits and veggies in the blender... No strange unidentifiable powders."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I found it by using yelp app I came up to the drive through window walked up and I met with a nice girl named Morgan she took her time to explain the menu thoroughly and help me with my current 30 day vegan challenge to accommodate my nutritional needs couple bites into the salad I found a crunchy and tasty in my smoothie felt the delicious going down my throat and 106° I like the convenience the speed The quality and the price I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to get a healthy bite and the staff is really nice. We showed up just before it closed and then they patiantly got our food ready even though they hit closing time. Food was great thanks."}
{"text":"very good option when you feel like eating out but have to stick to a meal plan. I usually get the warm berry quinoa bowl it's delicious! I have also tried the spinach bacon and egg bowl very good as we'll and fully loaded! I was surprised when I took my husband today he ordered the spinach and bacon wrap with steak and he loved it I am so glad he approved he said he wants to come back :)"}
{"text":"6/17/16  the 2 star review is for the experience I had today. normally, my experience is exemplary, but there were just so many issues today, I had to write this update.  today, a coworker went to Salad and Go and picked up a new Spicy Jalapeno Salad for me. I'd really been looking forward to this. she brought it back to work for me, and there was NO bacon on it, as well as the wrong dressing. I have no transportation to go to Salad and Go and have my salad replaced immediately, so I called them...all I reached was a recording. 4 hours later, when I was finally off work, I had my ride drive me over to Salad and Go, so that I could get my salad replaced. I explained what had happened, and even after explaining, I got a lecture from a supervisor(?) who said, \"well, next time, come back immediately\". I repeated that I DO NOT HAVE A CAR and therefore had no way to come over there immediately. they asked me what I wanted on my replacement salad and I repeated TWICE that I wanted blue cheese crumbles instead of cotija cheese. what did they give me? cotija cheese. whatever. I had to get home to my son, so I blew it off and went home. when I opened the salad, I found that at least A QUARTER of it was very badly wilted spinach. that was the last straw.  I'm very upset about this visit, but I hope it's a one time thing. I plan on returning(and getting my own food in person only, so I can check that it's exactly what is on the menu, exactly what I order, and FRESH), and I hope they've gotten it together by then. *********************** I figure it's about time I review this place, since I've been a regular since it opened!  The salads are around $6, plus $2 if you add a protein. The portions are ENORMOUS, and the toppings are evenly distributed throughout the salad, which is great! There are TONS of toppings, all fresh and bite-sized.  The Asian salad is fantastic, with peanuts, edamame, green onions, and pineapples--terrific if you add shrimp! The Greek salad is delicious, as well, especially with chicken. The seasonal Mediterranean Pasta Salad is AMAZING! While wheat penne, spinach, roasted broccoli and peppers, onions, kalamata olives, and feta cheese. I add a bunch of hot sauce and it's perfect!   Aside from salads, they have a delicious Chicken & Wild Rice Soup, and their various lemonades are fresh and refreshing!   So glad to have healthy fast food options near home/work!"}
{"text":"The ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I ordered the santa fe salad.  Service was friendly and fast. Was a little disappointed in the amount of ingredients compared to the amount of lettuce and not enough dressing for the size (ordered on the side and dipped and ran out with a lot of salad left). Have since read in review comments that you can ask for extra veggies at no cost (minus the expensive toppibgs like cheese, avocado, meat, etc). Not sure about dressing. I also ordered a diet soda (no brand provided but wasn't coke or pepsi). I paid $3 for a large. Soda wasn't very big for that price and  was mostly ice. Now that I know I can order with extra veggies, I will go back but won't order a soda.  Overall, really good and convenient to get restaurant like salads easily on my way home.  Definitely a better option than the other fast food places in the area. They have other items besides salads: soups,  wraps, smoothies, and healthy breakfast items."}
{"text":"Recommend: Yes!! Okay, this is 5 stars for a fast food place. Remember that. This is not the Ritz.  We stopped in today on a quick turnaround trip from S. Cal. I was intrigued by the idea of a healthy drive-thru. I was quite surprised and sorry to find that they have no dining room at all. But the good news is that the weather was nice so we sat outside and got bonus vitamin D3 while dining ;) Service is super fast and the food is super fresh!  Food: My hubby had the Cobb salad (hold the egg) and a regular black iced tea (they have fruity black teas also).  I had the Strawberry & Roasted Sweet potato salad with goat cheese and a champagne vinaigrette.   Oh! And one of the BEST cups of lemonade I've ever had (and I've had A LOT!).  I will dream of that cucumber mint lemonade for years, I'm sure of it. It was not overly sweet at all, the cucumber seemed to be minced and perhaps macerated. This added a unique sweet flavor to the beverage as you drank the bits at the bottom. There was just a hint of mint to brighten the flavor overall. This was truly a masterpiece of balancing and complimenting flavors! (Can you tell I REALLY liked it??)  Okay, back to the salads:  Cobb salad, hubby was satisfied, said it was good and it looked like it was nicely dressed, meaning not drowning, just well coated without a pool of dressing left at the end.  My Strawberry salad (I asked them to add cucumbers, too. I was really craving cucumber today.) was tossed in a VERY LIGHT coating of dressing (like, not all the leaves had dressing), but the salad had so much flavor from the ingredients, I did not want any more dressing as it would have detracted from the goodness going on in the bowl. The greens were a very fresh batch of mixed field greens. I did not find one yucky looking leaf! The salads are quite large, especially for a fast food place. I easily could have eaten only half and saved the rest to take home, but we still had 7-8 hours before we would be back home, so I ate it all :)  The salad was not packed full of tons of extras, but had just enough to taste good and have some goodies with the greens in every bite.   I would certainly return when in Gilbert again. (Oh that lemonade!!!!)"}
{"text":"Delicious salads!  Can easily make two meals from the generous portions.  I do wish that nutrition information was available for the dressings.  They will only disclose the \"saturated fat\" count, which restricts me from enjoying them more often."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars for ther salads and convenience. Salads are decent sized and tasty. Love the convenience of this place. Its great for a quick and healthy lunch. Giving 2 stars for the Kids turkey wrap...or should I say lettuce wrap. Its all lettuce and 1 thinly sliced piece of turkey. We do love the banana pinwheels though. Will stick to that from now on."}
{"text":"First time here. Pretty quick service. Good salad and the prices were better than most you find in this area. I'll be back to try some more and possibly update this review. There are several choices so it may be awhile"}
{"text":"From the outside you wouldn't think amazing food would come out of this shack, but it's true. Healthy, fast food. It's here!"}
{"text":"Fast to go salad place... great concept but very expensive for a sald in a small plastic box.. almost $8-10 for a salad that's like 8 by 8 inches... I went to the Southside location... was really not that fresh... tasted OK... nothing you can't make at home for twice as cheap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places.... fantastic food, great prices, healthy and to top it off... sensational customer service!! Hoping you expand on the North Scottsdale area:)"}
{"text":"I love their seasonal lemonades, the one for fall is a spiced apple lemonade and it's AMAZING. Their seasonal apple bacon salad is really good too, but my usual go-to when they don't have the apple bacon salad is the Greek with chicken it's so good! I love this place and I'm so happy to have one closer to me now."}
{"text":"Always consistent and delicious! I love their Greek salad with chicken, the chicken is sooo good and they go well together. Their cucumber mint lemonade is great too! I love that I can get a healthy meal at a drive through! I just wish there were a location closer to me in ahwatukee"}
{"text":"Alright I've been here now many times since it's close to my in laws so I'm ready to report :-P  It is super quick, no doubt. Even when I order something with a couple of changes or extra requests, by the time I get to the window, they are handing me my receipt and my food.  Their portions are very very filling. I usually get the cobb and add chicken (protein, baby, yeah!!) and I used to get the accompanying dressing but it's a little high on the calories so I skip it now. My kids get a wrap or a smoothie which I appreciate have very simple, clean ingredients and are what I myself would make at home (but obviously not if I'm running around with errands!). We rarely do eating out when it's the kids and I but on some occasions I have stopped here for the convenience. And I will continue to!"}
{"text":"Finally a healthy option for a quick lunch. The BBQ steak salad is my all time favorite. The dressing is a spicy-ish BBQ ranch. I've always ordered my dressing on the side because I don't like a lot but the other day I ordered it tossed. Huge mistake. I can see why some reviews have called the salads soggy or wilted, it was just way too much dressing. If your like me and don't like it drenched in dressing get it on the side. A must try is the seasonal Watermelon Mint Lemonade. Oh my heck! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited so long to try Salad and Go! Absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. Love love love the Blueberry Rosemary Lemonade!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much... but I was so surprised! I've not had anything bad here AND I would say they have the second best blue cheese dressing in phoenix. Seriously, it's worth your lunch break and you'll feel better after you eat it too."}
{"text":"PLEASE COME TO VEGAS!  S&G is awesome. There's no way around that. It's a fast food salad option, except the salads are fresh-made, huge, and delicious. It's actually not \"fast food\" in any way but convenience. They have a walk-up menu and drive-thru, and they even open at 6:30AM so you can grab your bfast or lunch on your way to work. You really have no excuse not to.  Their salads are great- seasonal options, unique combinations like strawberry and roasted sweet potato, housemade dressings, all in huge portions. A friend of mine actually manages to get two meals out of each salad. Add on your protein for under $3 (EVEN SHRIMP), and it's a generous amount. AND THEY HAVE VEGAN PROTEIN.  Not into salad? That's not all they have. There's a kids menu, soups, sides, smoothies, desserts, and an all-day breakfast menu. It's ridiculous, and everything I tried was ridiculously good. Even if you don't buy into the whole \"salads are healthy!\" thing, the nutritional info and calorie counts are posted and you can add, subtract, or substitute ingredients to make a meal that matches your dietary restrictions or health goals.   Service is super friendly and, my favorite part, prices are extremely reasonable. I visited multiple times during my trip to Phoenix and also grabbed extra lunches for work on my way out of town. Full sized salads, with added protein, around $8 apiece. Again, I repeat, PLEASE COME TO VEGAS! Literally the only downside about this place is that I am physically prevented from visiting due to the laws of geography.   Favorite items: Caprese salad without the balsamic, seasonal chicken and rice soup, the creamy Greek vinaigrette, turkey-cucumber wraps, Cobb plus chikn for hella protein, apple-walnut salad sub feta for the bleu, their OG \"thousand island\" dressing made with fresh herbs, added pea protein in the smoothies...  TLDR: It's uncharacteristic of me to visit a fast food restaurant, let alone to review it, but this place is so good that I want them to move next door to me so I can give them all of my money. I would seriously consider franchising one. Ownership/management, your move."}
{"text":"I have driven the extra mile to eat here several times since opening day.  The Santa Fe wrap is delicious! Salads are of large portion, fresh, and tasty. I added chicken to a couple of my salads which is worth it. They offer a healthy kid's menu as well. The beverage selection is just as healthy as the salads.  Mango ginger lemonade is my favorite.  I give them 5 stars for excellent, fast service, offering a great selection of healthy choices, and fresh, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious salad for a good price. The drive though was pretty busy but was worth the wait for a healthy cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Concept seemed awesome and I decided to try it.   At first impression, prices seemed high but I figured it was this healthy new concept and worth it.  I ordered the Caprese wrap with chicken. Was excited to get home and try it and man was I in for the worst experience in food I have ever had. The chicken was as cold as ice cubes, the texture was literally like eating through cartilage and coated in pepper as if it was used for medicinal purposes. I tried to work through it since I hate being wasteful... On the second bite the wrap started breaking apart and leaking and I have not put any dressing on it as I go it on the side. I looked at my hand and it was covered in oil and pepper bits and the taste was just horrendous.  This is not as healthy as it seems, its made very poorly, it uses the cheapest meat possible that they just toss from a open bowl in a fridge that was made god knows when and its not cheap nor fast. Never again."}
{"text":"Our air conditioning went out yesterday, and there was no way in Hell i was gonna cook and add more heat to our house. So we decided on salads for supper.  Great salads!  I got the BBQ ranch with chicken added, my husband got the Caesar salad with chicken added.  Generous portions for the price.  Came to $15 and some change for my husband and I.  I like that the dressing comes on the side and not all over the salad as I don't like a lot of dressing.  Very friendly service, and it was fast too.  My only complaint was that my avocado on my salad was hard as a rock.  Definitely wasn't ripe yet.  So that got thrown away.  Made me sad.  Other than that, it was great and will be our new go-to for nights when cooking isn't an option.z"}
{"text":"So I'm visiting from LA, a vegetarian athlete...so when I saw salads with the option of adding veggie gardein chicken, I got super excited!! What I got was 90% romaine lettuce, very little other ingredients and four or five pieces of chicken. Flavor fail, salad fail."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times.... extremely cordial staff... nice alternative menus.... refreshing drinks.... so why such a low rating? The amount of plastic that encases each meal is almost criminal...there are many types of alternative packaging options at your disposal....   I would eat here more often, but I have a social conscience........ There are \"plastic products\" made from potatoes, corn starch, etc that are bio degradable...... sure they cost a bit more, but cost less to the environment. And I believe, as a marketing tool, it would increase your business...  I WANT to eat here.... but not at the cost of the plastic....."}
{"text":"I gave this place one stars because of the service I received. My mom and I are waiting for our food, that's was taking along time by the way, and we are making small talk with the lady at the window.   The lady sees the logo of company my mom works for on her shirt. The lady immediately starts to bad mouth the company saying she had a bad experience and starts to go off. We did not come here to be harassed while we wait for our food. Putting my mom an awkward position and apologized to the lady for her bad experience on the companies behalf. They need to teach their works about proper conversation with customers. True it could have been just that one lady but it was completely unnecessary. If this incident did not happen I would still be going here."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed!!  I just left the the drive through after ordering 2 breakfast bowls.  I arrived at my office and was very displeased when I noticed that the potatoes in both bowls were burnt.  I have this place the benefit of the doubt the last two times but this is the last time    I went there 2 weeks ago and ordered a parfait and the cup was only half full.  I informed the cashier at the front and she took back the cup and gave me the same one only adding more granola.  Paying more and getting less."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cobb Salad with Chicken and dresing on the side. Got back to my desk, grabbed the salad and found no salad dressing. Bummer. The salad is good, but would have been better with the dressing"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy options available for a great value and quickly. Love this place, wish I could eat here on the daily!"}
{"text":"Best greek salad I've ever had. I had a strawberry and spinach smoothie and it was fantastic. Completely real fruit smoothie. Not a bad price either."}
{"text":"Very happy to find low calorie food near us. The staff was friendly and the food was done fast. Our food was very tasty we got a Santa Fe Wrap and a Greek Wrap with Chia Tea Latte. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great salads, great service, and great prices. We've been talking about the need for a place like this in ur sea for a while, and now we have it. No more \"I want something healthy\", with no choices in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love love love coming here! They have vegan options and now offer tofu! Love it. Best fast food place for vegans and vegetarians. 5 stars for my location because they always accommodate my request. Warm berry Quinoa bowl: Amazing! breakfast Smoothie: Amazing! Power wrap: Amazing! If you like peanut butter you'll like these."}
{"text":"There really isn't anything I like more than getting a delicious meal quickly and at a good price. I tried Salad and Go for the first time today and will surely be back! I had the BBQ Ranch salad with chicken while my bf had the seasonal Roasted Butternut Squash & Quinoa with chicken salad. Both were incredibly flavorful and super filling. We were in and out of the drive through in easily under 5min. I can't wait to try some more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"Guilt-Free Drive-Thru! I'm fortunate enough to come to Gilbert on business every few months & by far this is my #1 favorite spot! Consistently fresh & delicious, surprisingly fast and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"The best salad in town, fresh and a great price. It is like healthy fast food. Very clean too."}
{"text":"I just had the Cobb with Chicken and it was awesome.  Fast, clean and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place really caters to those of us who count calories, carbs, fat, and protein. Most food items on menu have all 4 values listed."}
{"text":"This is really simple - start a fast, simple, healthy restaurant and provide friendly, fairly quick service - and I'm a fan for life.  I just hit Salad and Go for about the 4th time last night - drive through every time - and it's just fantastic.  Everything is super fresh, portions are good, and friendly, energetic youngsters serving the goods.  I'm sure I'll hit this place at least twice a week - it's awesome."}
{"text":"I am very happy their is a Salad spot that isn't over price, I understand profits but places other then here want to mark up salad 300-500% mark up of cost! This place is my new fix, I'm from Cali and as everyone knows cali people are picky with food and heath! Portions are super good and cost is super low, I will be visiting all locations like its people and them nasty Starbucks drinks lol.. cheers"}
{"text":"I love salad to go! Wanted to try something new and got the asian salad! Something was off; I got home to a salad with no dressing! Got inside and thought maybe the dressing was pre-added  nope! Naked salad it was... My lady was so butthurt after waiting a few hours to have lunch at home to a boring rabbit ready greens! Booo"}
{"text":"About as good as a salad can get! One salad is good for two people and the kids menu has decent options. The lemonades and salad dressings are a direct hit."}
{"text":"Best tasting salad for the buck, hands down!  You can't beat the variety, flavors and amazingly friendly service. My fave is the Greek salad plus chicken - I had it two days in a row and will probably have it again before the week is over. I'm truly obsessed!  Thank you for opening so close to me, Salad & Go!"}
{"text":"Typically when I think of a salad, I don't think of it satisfying my desire for \"something good\" as much as much as other types of meal choices. I decided to try Salad & Go and was surprised how well they were able to mix in a good variety of flavors that complimented each other into their salads. We will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Salads are delicious and fresh. The cobb salad is one of our favorites. They also have a delicious strawberry and spinach smoothie. A great new add to Surprise."}
{"text":"I love love love this place and I'm so happy that there is now one on Williamsfield near my home.  The wait here can be a little crazy around lunch so if you have an hour lunch maybe think again until we are fortunate enough to have more of these around.  I must say though,  the wait does not keep me away.  The flavors and the freshness of the veggies is insane and delicious so I'll be coming and waiting for as long as I have to! The people that work here are also incredibly kind.  Never see a frown and even when they are super busy I wouldn't know it because they don't show or react to the crazy stress.  Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"So glad that they opened up this location because it's down the street from my house and it's so worth it that I was going all the way to the one in downtown Gilbert. the people at this restaurant as you are just as friendly and kind as the other ones and the food is just as delicious. They are never as busy as the downtown Gilbert one so if you are in between those two I would definitely start coming to this one  !"}
{"text":"I am so addicted to the Mixed Green and Apple salad.  It if very good.  I highly recommend Salad n Go, to anyone looking for a great salad.  I wish they were about a dollar cheaper, though!!"}
{"text":"Brown Road, just east of Higley. Next door to KFC, just to the east of KFC on the south side of Brown Road. Easy access off Brown or exit Higley by the Iowa Cafe.  Check out the menu online first.  No indoor seating or dining. Drive through or walk-up to a different window. Average time order to delivery is about five minutes or less.   Great food, decent prices. Cute bright orange plastic forks which are mostly useless because they bend to easily. I think they recently raised their prices across the board. Like most carry out restaurants their napkins are not worth taking, they do not tolerate actually being used like most of them are these days."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Talk about surprises! Amazingly huge  fresh wrap filled with a perfect blend of great ingredients. Prices were incredibly reasonable! This WILL be our new alternative to the same old,  same old Subway. All salads are fresh and can be made into a wrap. We also had the chicken corn chowder. Not quite as good as mine, but close! It's walk up or drive through only. They have a few outside tables which is okay this time of the year in the late day. They have soups, a great kids' meal, breakfast bowls and burritos and smoothies. Please go to this nice little shop...I want it to stay in business!!!"}
{"text":"I'm finally writing a well deserved review. I've been here many times before and each time I've been completely satisfied with my experience. I've tried the salads, chia parfaits, wraps and fresh lemonades. I really enjoyed each one. So far my favorite salad is the Asian salad. The Cobb salad is also a favorite in my household.   The service is very fast and the food is always fresh. They have many options to choose from when ordering. The only thing I wish was different was the location. I really want one to be in my backyard, I would probably go everyday if that was the case.   I'm really happy that they've came up with a fast food chain that serves up fresh healthy meals instead of your typical greasy GMO hormone injected processed crap! I heart salads!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Walked up and made my selection which was a Cobb salad.  Took about 5 mins to get and I was on my way.  Everything was fresh and the dressing with cilantro was so good!  Def will be back soon. Good customer service too!"}
{"text":"salad to is really good very healthy and quick service,  the only thing is that it is price,  order a salad ith steak and lemonade total 10.00 for salad.  lol but I will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Their salads are fine, but I love their power bars. If you are a peanut butter fan, you will love them too. So delicious! I also love the Breakfast Smoothie. Yum! Their kids meals are also a go to for us because they have healthy choices that actually taste good."}
{"text":"First time at Salad to Go.  I was not disappointed.   Nice fresh salad at reasonable prices.  Very healthy!  It's about time we have healthy 'fast food'.   Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"We love s&g! Soo convenient for a healthy weekday lunch or dinner on the fly. Unfortunately the line for the drive-thru can get pretty lengthy. There is a preschool nearby and  therefore lots of cutthroat soccer mom's who will stop at no lengths to get in line ahead of you lol. This just provides testament to how awesome they are, though.  Bring your pooch along for the ride! They'll hook it up with a yummy dog biscuit for your canine companion, too!"}
{"text":"Earlier today I was working from home and hungry, but feeling a bit too lazy to make my own food. I wanted something healthy, so I reluctantly typed \"salad\" into the Yelp search bar. I say \"reluctantly\" here because I was expecting for every restaurant that serves a boring side salad to show up on the listing, and I wouldnt find what I really wanted without really searching through menus and such.  I can't tell you how excited and surprised I was when \"Salad and Go\" was one of the top listings. Close by! A menu of mainly Salad and Wraps! DRIVE THRU!! I couldn't believe my eyes. A DRIVE THRU salad FAST FOOD place?!? Amazing!  I drove over and got the special Salad- Autumn Squash Salad, with roasted squash, pine nuts, ricotta salata, balsamic red onions, sun dried tomato dressing. I also added chicken to it, and the total was around $8. You get a HUGE portion thats incredibly filling that you dont feel guilty about. Their regular salads are $5.50, and I think its such a great deal. I have never seen a strictly healthy fast food place before, and I sure hope this isn't the last one I see! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Good Salads - Bought 2 separate kinds of Salads. My husband LOVED it and so did I. The dressing wasn't too heavy but wasn't sparing either. The Chicken was flavorful and it didn't cost an arm and a leg but fed the 4 of us comfortably.  Good Breakfast Menu also! Took my kids one morning before school (love that their open early) My kids loved the wraps and since there was no time for smoothies at home had the smoothies as well. Great choice of breakfast for us all to start the day without being overly expensive. Nice to know there are places that serve food that is good for us without being \"PROCESSED!!\""}
{"text":"Just moved here and thought we'd give it a try for a light evening meal, since it's 112° outside. The wife ordered a wrap and I ordered a salad. She said the wrap was excellent. My salad was very good and big. We'll need to try the breakfast one morning."}
{"text":"OMG YUM!!!! You need to go here. I couldn't believe how fresh and delicious my salad was. We also go the protein box for our little and it was fresh and delicious. To feed 3 people = $30! Awesome price. We just went through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from the gym and had the asian salad with shrimp. couldn't wait to get home, started eating it in the car and it was amazing. the shrimp was nice and tender and the lettuce was really crisp. I love that it's a local business and that it's really healthy fast food!!! Can't wait to go back and try the steak on one of the salads!"}
{"text":"In the immortal words of George Takei,\"Oh my!!\" This place is amazing. As having recently converted to a much healthier diet, my fiancée and I just haven't really been able to find a place that fills the \"it's too late to make diner\" void. This place just filled that hole, with amazingly fresh, tasteful salad!!! No joke, a \"fast food\" joint that's truly healthy. We used the drive through, and really appreciated being able to watch them make our salad as we waited. Perfectly chopped greens, great lettuce to dressing to chicken ratio, PERFECT!!! I can't wait to come back here. Oh, this is the Salad and Go on Gilbert Rd. Service was prompt, friendly, and the place looked really clean. Thanks again for an amazing experience!!!!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time and are happy to see a \"fast food\" place that offers healthy food.  We hope more places follow their example.  The place is great and one of the few places you can get healthy food quickly. Love the Mixed Greens and Apples salad, as well as the Greek, Cobb, and Peanut Butter Power Wrap. You can customize your order however you want, the ingredients are always fresh, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy and delicious! 1st time ever and I loved it a lot! Really like the drive thru thing, makes it really easy!"}
{"text":"Best fast food experience I've ever had. Natural, healthy, organic ingredients.  Quick service from friendly employees. Been to this location at least a dozen times and every visit has been flawless."}
{"text":"Simple concept, executed very well.  Fresh salads, made to order, and pretty affordable.  I don't give 5 stars to many businesses, but Salad and Go is doing everything right.    I'm not a big fan of salad, but for a healthy alternative, it is really good, and there's lots of variety.  I've been twice so far, and will probably become a regular."}
{"text":"La megor ensalada Es un buen lugar para disfrutar una ensalada . Los empleados son muy cortes con los cliente"}
{"text":"I was super excited when this place opened up, close to my work.   When it first opened, I went to get lunch and it was a just ok experience. However, I wanted to give them yet, another try.   This time, I ordered a caprese salad to go (NO ONIONS OR PROTEIN). When I got back to the office, as hungry as I was - I started digging right in to my salad. Boy was I in for a surprise.....  Not only that I got chicken and 2 pieces of some gross looking salami, I also got a whole pail of onions. Really???? Chicken, I was not to mad about as much as I did not care for it but onions.???? That is where the line was pushed. I wonder does is ever occurred to food industry people that we might have certain allergies.....?   The lettuce it-self was super chunky and in large pieces. Not appetizing at all. In the entire salad, I got 2 pieces of mozzarella cheese but they sure did not mind to hook me up with onions.   I was really, really disappointed. Yes, it is a cheap salad but still - this was a compete waste of my time and money. The salad ended up in garbage and I ended up eating banana and peanut butter that I had in the office for my afternoon snack. At least there were no onions on it ;-)   I do not think I will go back and if anybody asks me at work, I will tell them the truth about my two unsuccessful visits there. Did I mention there is over 400 employees in my office and I am chair of our Wellness Committee. I am sorry, I am going little to hard on Salad- to -Go but when you leave me hungry by messing up my order - trust me, you do not want to be around. How hard is it to mess up a salad, really?   For me, it does not matter if my lunch/dinner costs me $5 or $50, I will be picky and have decent amount of expectations. It is food and it should be handled properly."}
{"text":"Breakfast quinoa bowl was amazing, I was full for hours and the flavor was awesome. On another occasion I got a breakfast burrito and it was good as well. Nice convenient location that seemed to get a ton of customers and efficiently keep the line moving."}
{"text":"Sitting in a parking lot right now actually eating their Caesar salad and traditional lemonade. Omg its really good. Would suggest to anyone! From the drive thru to the window, less than 3 minutes for everything! And very friendly workers there. Will be definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this salad and go and 1 other location. I wish I could give a 5 star review however, the portions at this location seems to be smaller then the other location. The most noticeably different is the Chia Seed Parfait, the other location fills the cup with the Parfait goodness to the top of the cup but this Surprise location only fills it a third of the way. For some people this might not be a huge deal but if I am paying almost $5 for a parfait I want it to be full. The qualify of the food is on point and delicious which is why I am still giving a 4 star review. I really enjoy the BBQ Chicken Salad, Santa Fe Salad, Chai Seed Parfait and the Peanut Butter Protein Wrap with strawberries, coconut flakes and banana."}
{"text":"I have always raced by this place on my way to work, literally! This place is located on a very fast and busy street, so it was very easy to miss and hard to turn in to. Finally, I had the opportunity to pull into this place when the street was not so busy, early in the morning, and I am very pleased that I did.  Very friendly staff! I ordered a wrap and a breakfast taco. The spinach breakfast taco was pretty good (I will order it with turkey sausage next visit). Lunch time arrived and the wrap was still very fresh, crisped lettuce, along with all the other ingredients, with peanut sauce on the side, was very delicious!! As I inhaled my wrap and making load crunchy sounds, my co-workers were asking where I got the huge wrap from and I gladly announced where!  I will definitely visit this place again. Keep up your great service and keep the food consistent - Fresh!"}
{"text":"YUMMY IN THE TUMMY!!  This place hits the spot! So good, super fresh, and lightning fast. Great selection, friendly service, and reasonably priced. I will definitely be going back...and maybe even go out of my way."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the salads is the customer service! Always fresh, fast, delicious, and cheap!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place (other loc) I thought it was eh. So so glad I tried it a second time. Now I'm kind of hooked!! The Cobb and the Greek salads are my fav, love the fountain sodas, the iced tea and of course Bergie's coffee!!!! They have awesome soups. I haven't tried the bfast yet but really want to. So thrilled this is by my house!"}
{"text":"Excellent options, good prices, great coffee, line always moves quick. Our family loves this place."}
{"text":"My life loves this place and I enjoy the breakfast burritos from time to time.  I would give it a 5star rating but due to a few bad experiences that we have had here I feel comfortable with a generous 4 star review."}
{"text":"My mom is addicted to this place and now I see why.  Healthy tasty fast food!  Santa Fe salad with chicken is my favorite and the Cobb salad is mine.  Only issue is they need larger drinks to go. But so happy they're finally open and close to moms house."}
{"text":"Tried today for the first time, and so glad I did!  I got the Cobb salad without bacon, the order came out quickly and correct.  It was so cheap, the salad was much bigger than I had anticipated, all the ingredients were fresh and it was delicious!  The service was pleasant and overall it was a great experience and I hope one pops up in Tempe soon."}
{"text":"I really like their salads. My only complaint is the chicken can be dry like it's overcooked. The southwest salad with the roasted peppers in it is my favorite so far. I ordered the other southwest salad that has Pico de Gallo and there really wasn't any Pico on it that I could find, though, so I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Prompt and quick service.  The staff takes their time to explain the menu if it's your first time, or if you have any questions.  The menu offers a variety of healthy food choices.  The price is reasonable, and very competitive.  Location is ideal."}
{"text":"This salad restaurant is pretty convenient for a light and healthy yet fulfilling meal. I got the strawberry & sweet potato salad and was more than full with their very large portion. The strawberries were red and crisp the sweet potato was soft and sweet yet firm, the lettuce was crunchy. They have a drive through so you don't have to go inside and wait, it's kind of nice because it is very quick service especially if you're on the go."}
{"text":"I love the convenience and price!  Huge dinner portions for less than Chipotle.  The staff is friendly and quick.  It's empowering to have a healthy option so close to home!"}
{"text":"First time I've gone there for breakfast. I had the burrito bowl which was very good. I wouldn't recommend if you are watching cholesterol. I have to watch my sugar, so this worked as it was mostly protein. I would order it again. The salsa that comes with it did not look very good but it had very good flavor with just the right amount of hotness. I also ordered a coffee with soymilk. I've never had Bergies before. It was pretty good for plain coffee. I wish they would start offering soups in the winter. I don't like eating salads when it is cold."}
{"text":"I'm really ticked. Since when does salad and go not toss in the dressing???? I've never been to this particular location but it's close to where I work now. Helloooo....the dressing needs to be tossed in. There isn't enough room in the bowl to toss it oneself. I can't really give a review on the taste or the Southwest Caesar since the toppings aren't evenly distributed. Every time I try to mix my salad, it goes all over the place. Once bite is a bunch of dry kale (yuck!) and the next is radishes with a hunk of dressing. WTH!  Unless someone is taking their salad home where they can dump it into a larger bowl for tossing, mix it up, or at least have the decency to ask me which option I'd like. No one ever asked. I don't know if it's just this one or if they have so many now that quality control and customer service are in the toilet."}
{"text":"Okay, so a salad in a wrap may defeat the purpose of healthy eating...so sue me. It was worth it. :-) First time here after months of longing. Lots of yummy sounding salads(which you can also get in an original or wheat wrap). Hubby and I both got the BBQ ranch salad (added chicken) in wheat wraps. The two total were $15 and were substantial in size.   The salad itself has a SW vibe and was very good but we both agreed that the dressing was just \"meh\" and not worth the calories. We may get the same salad next time but with the lime and honey vinaigrette instead of BBQ ranch. The wraps were fresh as was the chicken, in addition to being high quality white meat. We will be back and look forward to trying more combinations."}
{"text":"Wow I love salad and go.  Can you say BIG SALAD.  I just love the friendly staff.  I live in Scottdale.  I can't wait till it opens"}
{"text":"feel like grabbing a chicken Cesar for $300? how about 2 salads for $550? Go here to blow your last paycheck on lettuce."}
{"text":"How many places can I honestly say are healthy, inexpensive, always delicious, AND have drive through?  At least one now. Let's cut to the chase...you'll never go wrong with their seasonal options. Be brave! You can get Ceaser anywhere, try a new and interesting salad they've crafted. The lemonade is amazing, and the coffee is from local roaster Bergie's.  In fact, the other day i pulled out of the line at Dutch Bros to avoid the 30 min wait because i remebered Salad and Go has Bergies iced coffee! Today I'm sick and home and decided to get some delicious chicken soup drive through style so I can stay in jammies. Wow. New go-to meal for sick days. It's amazing! Full of veggies, wild rice, great broth and of course chicken. Mmm...Feeling better already!"}
{"text":"Salad and go is an awesome place for salads so glad to have a couple of locations close to my work. Whenever i don't bring my own lunch to work i just go there and grab something real quick. Always fresh ingredients, amazing taste and cheap prices. Awesomeness!!"}
{"text":"Salad and go is the place to go i would say! Very fresh ingredients and salads come in big portions. The place was really crowded as well. They do mainly drive thru but you can park your car and have your salad at one of their outside table. Salads that other people were having seemed delicious also. Great concept and good interpretation at very affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Amazing salad. Very fresh ingredients and tastes great! I ordered the greek salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing i loved it definitely recommend it. The staff are very friendly as well. I asked the employee of i could take his picture handing me the salad and he was very friendly and agreed :)"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd live to see the day where there would be a salad drive-thru on every corner. Ok, so it's not on every corner, but you'll wish it was.   I've had the salads, soups, breakfast wraps, tea/ coffee, and the breakfast bowls. Every single item it's delicious. My favorite salad is the Santa Fe with chicken. They also give customers an extra side of dressing (if you ask) for my fellow condiment geeks. I don't think any of my salads ever had so much as one wilted leaf.    The breakfast rolled tacos are basically baby burritos packed with egg white, cheese, and either spinach or sausage - both rock. The salsa is crazy delicious. It's thin, and reminds me of fresh squeezed tomato juice salsa-y addictive...stuff. If you are extra hungry, get a breakfast bowl. They are protein-packed, and won't leave you hungry.   I've never had a bad experience between my two frequented locations: Chandler Blvd; Southern Rd... The service is fast and friendly, and if they run out of something (happens when you serve fresh foods only) they are quick to remedy. This is a common lunch choice for my family."}
{"text":"Special price drop for 2018!! Salads under $6!! I love their seasonal specialty salads. The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The specialty soups are very good too and REALLY COMFORT FOOD!!  My favorite usual go to salads are the Cobb, Greek and Southwestern.  Each has a different base of greens with lots of added toppings and delicious salad dressings.  I usually ask for an extra dressing because the salads are generous portions.   They have always given me a correct order. I'm impressed with that.  The drive through is fast!  The women who work there are friendly, capable, accurate!  They rock and so does this place!"}
{"text":"What a concept! Our salads (butternut squash seasonal and cobb) were plentiful, fresh, reasonably priced and tasty. Did I mention fast?? We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Always tastes so fresh, costs around $6 for a great portion and is just so delicious! Really great options too--my favorite is the Greek salad! Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Salad and Go is great for... yep, you guessed it! A quick salad to-go.  5 minutes and you have a freshly prepared salad or wrap to grab and go. Their food is always on point, the only reason I docked a star is because they sometimes forget to add the chicken to my wraps that I order. No sense in complaining over $1.44 but attention to detail is important.  Typically very friendly, prices are reasonable and proportions are fair.  A much better alternative to the Wendy's or Taco Bell down the way."}
{"text":"This place always has excellent customer service and the food is amazing. A little sad that the three bean vegetable chili was only seasonal... was THE best!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving this location 2 stars is because the food is decent. Today the customer service was atrocious. I was at the speaker attempting to make my order and the gal taking it got everything I was saying wrong. I had to repeat everything twice. I tried to order a Turkey wrap kids meal which is ONLY advertised on the menu with A drink and fruit for $3.99. First, the girl asked if I wanted a protein in the wrap, I asked \"doesn't the turkey wrap come with turkey?\" Then she asked if I wanted to make it a meal? I said \"I'm not sure what you mean, your menu says in big letters Kids Meals and what's included\". Then a man took over and started lecturing me on how \"typically\" people order it ala cart. I said \"I want it as your menu advertises it\". So he says \"so you want the meal? Because you can order it ala cart for $2.99 or a meal for $3.99\". All of this banter is being given to me with a smug attitude. Finally, I get to the window and they screwed up and didn't add the drink I ordered so I had to correct it and the rude guy says \"we didn't hear it\" so I said \"that's understandable with all the arguing at the intercom\". No apologies the entire time. Just a shitty attitude. After I pay and get my food, he quickly shuts the window and starts talking crap to the other employees in there and looking at me grinning. Now I'm home and my salad has NO chicken as I ordered it. I should have went to Fresh Millions where the customer service is ALWAYS good and friendly. If this was my business, all three of them would be fired."}
{"text":"I drive by this location all the time, so I was anxiously waiting for this place to open up.  Since it's been open, I've frequented it a couple of times, and really enjoy having a drive through option that isn't fast food.  Usually when I go, it's because I need the drive-through and I need something I can eat in the car, so I always get my salad as a wrap.  It's delicious that way, although unfortunately that wrap does add some calories!   I also love their kids menu options... different but healthy and not so different your (my) picky kids won't eat them.  I do also appreciate quick the service is and how friendly the staff are."}
{"text":"I am so bummed... I am a HUGE fan and supporter of salad and go. First time at this location and I am so disappointed. The lettuce is so wilted and brown and the bowl is not even half full. I got it in the am for my lunch so maybe it was leftover lettuce from last night. I will definitely be back because my prior experience have been amazing!! I am leaving this because as a restaurant manager I would want to know."}
{"text":"My first time at this location and it was ok.  The customer service could be better, I was asking the girl at the window questions and she seemed put out. I was not sure about the salad dressing it would have been nice to be offered a taste of the dressing, because if you leave and dont like it, then what.  I added chicken to my salad but there was very little added.  The salad was fresh and it is convenient. Hope they open in Tempe."}
{"text":"Love that there is a healthy drive through/walk up option for a quick salad, smoothie or soup.  They have breakfast options as well which is handy if you happen to be near a location and need to pick something up.  The summer menu has gazpacho which is very tasty! They always have a Strawberry Kale Smoothie on the menu as well as a special smoothie and salad."}
{"text":"Great alternative to the fast food my family is use to... Quick drive thru and healthy for the family, light for summer HOT days"}
{"text":"Tasty salads! I love the BBQ Ranch with chicken! Try it in a wrap, too!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to try Salad and Go. I live a good distance away so I hadn't had a chance.   I was the 3rd car in line to order.  The ordering process was fast and efficient.  It took less than 5 mintues to make it to the window.   I got the special (written on a board by the menu): strawberries, blue cheese, croutons, almonds, berry vinegrette.  I added chicken since this was my lunch.    Very fast service.  The gal at the window was very friendly.    The salad itself was huge.  Very large portion.  Lots of strawberries.  Could have used some more blue cheese.  The chicken portion was kind of small, I'd l'd like to see more for the additional charge.  But overall the salad was delicious and I will be going back for sure.    The menu has lots of options, with the addition of different proteins and different dressings, the options are endless.    I heard there will be more locations soon,and I'm really looking forward to one coming closer to my home.    This is such a great option for a quick meal on the go that doesn't include fries and a soda.  This is such a great idea.     I am very happy and will return when in the area"}
{"text":"I Love salad and go. I have ate at this location many times!!!  BUT The last few weeks the salad has been all lettuce!  $9.00 for a all lettuce and hardly any meet or other fixings. I don't know if they changed management, or what but I've gone to this location for the last time."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! They use local ingredients, very reasonable prices, and the portions are huge. Fast and friendly. While in the drive-thru you can peek in and they are always using gloves, washing their hands, etc. A few more salad choices would be nice but it's such a  novel idea so I can't complain! Lunch time is super busy, faster to go to stand in window. Their organic sodas are also very yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is such a great idea, I love to bring my son here for a fast healthier option, I recommend the Mediterranean salad, ad if you have kids, the fruit smoothies and banana peanut butter wraps are really good.. I just wish they had more locations!!   And i love the mint cucumber lemonade. So refreshing!!"}
{"text":"What an incredible concept. It seems as though this would be a bad idea to specialize in one thing, but it's actually genius. I watch what I eat carefully so I'm always interested in finding healthy alternatives to the junk food that is taking over this area, so to find a place like this made me jump for joy! This is really a hidden gem!  They have an EXTENSIVE menu of salads and they all sound delicious. They also have wraps and breakfast foods so you can pretty much stop by here night and day and get super healthy food for breakfast/lunch/dinner. They also have a calorie count on the board so you can make the healthiest choice for you. I like this and wish all restaurants would do this.  I pulled up to a very friendly voice offering help and decided on the Santa Fe (it was a tough choice!). They ask about dressing and whether you want it on the side or tossed (which is so nice) and then you seriously have your order almost as soon as you pull to the window.   The reason for the four stars is because of the visibility issue below and the fact that, while this salad was DIVINE, the items that go in the salad are lots and lots of lettuce, little bits of everything else. This particular salad had red pepper (which I did not taste), corn, tomatoes, beans, cilantro, jicama and cojito cheese. There was very little of any of that, but enough to know that I would eat this every day if the mixings were more abundant. I understand the salad is less than $6, but it really is a lot of lettuce with just a tease of flavor making you want more. Which you don't get. The flavors are delicious together, they really know what they're doing with a salad, but just give me more filling items and I'll be SO happy!   The ONE thing I would seriously advise (and this actually peeves me so much thinking about it that I have to try not to blow my top) is that when you pull OUT of the drive-thru that you go SLOWLY and look BOTH WAYS. I almost got t-boned by a truck hauling a$$ through the parking lot because I couldn't see as I was pulling out. They have some serious issues with visibility there. It's dangerous - the guy swerved hard to miss me.   So, I'll definitely be back, but hope they fix the minor issues to make this a standout amongst junk food that has taken over everywhere!"}
{"text":"Sick & tired of not getting my salad correct at this location!!! Hate this location!!! I used to live by the location on Higley/Williamsfield & they NEVER EVER got my order wrong!! Now that I live in N. Mesa I have to go to this one on Higley/Brown. When I order a standard salad off the menu board, there is always something missing! I would suggest going up to the window personally & checking everything over real good before you leave. Buyer beware!!! Check your salad before you drive off!!! So frustrating!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after forgetting mine at home. I got the Cesar wrap with chicken and it was delicious! They took my order and I waited maybe 3 minutes. Overall a great, healthy place to eat!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this establishment was Friday afternoon, July 1st.  I am vegan and this is my new favorite fast food restaurant.  The kitchen was clean, the staff was friendly but best of all, I got a large salad for a fraction of the cost that I would have paid at Panara or Wildflower Bakeries.      I purchased a Oriental Salad with imitation chicken and it was absolutely delicious.  It had just enough dressing.  The other ingredients (edimone, nuts & seeds, pineapple, etc.) balanced the greens perfectly.     I would have expected the quality of salad from a much pricier eatery.     I am already telling my friends and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a bit, but the roads are washed out and seemed like such a long way around. Today my bestie surprised me with a caprese chicken salad and a blueberry rosemary lemonade. I was very impressed. Great mix of actual greens, not that iceburg  lettuce some places call salad, fresh sliced mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, onion, pesto sauce,  chicken breast, and a balsamic dressing which my bestie got on the side. The salad was HUGE... I literally have enough for lunch tomorrow. The lemonade was perfect too not over sweet, each flavor sang through every sip... very refreshing... and it was cheap... I'll be a regular as long as I am in the area... great salads!!!"}
{"text":"Solid salads at a great price! I'm in from out of town and wanted a quick meal before heading to my hotel. This place was inexpensive and we were in and out in a jiffy. They have a drive thru, but we wanted more time to look at the menu so we parked and walked up to the window. The young man that took our order was very friendly and so was the girl that prepared the salads. There is plenty of parking and they have a few tables outside if you want to eat there.  I got the strawberry, sweet potato, goat cheese salad with steak. It was about $8 and worth every penny. The portion was pretty large and unlike other places (cough, cough, sweetgreen), they don't skimp on the good stuff and give you a bowl of just lettuce.   My only problem is that they don't have this chain in Chicago!"}
{"text":"I stopped here in a bit of a hurry today, hoping that I could get my food quickly and go, but there were SIX cars ahead of me. Instead of find someplace else and wait in line there, I stuck around and was amazed how fast we moved through! Seriously, it was almost like they were moving so fast you felt bad for ordering too slow or taking to long to put your change away. Even still, the lady at the window was very friendly and helpful. Once I finally got to sit down and eat, I found the salad was nice and green, but pretty average. However! The dressings (I asked to try a couple) were both so delicious, I couldn't decide which one to use!   Overall, a great experience, a good price, a delicious, healthy lunch and really good flavored (unsweetened) tea! I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Only been here a few times but they have great service and fast. Everything I have ordered has tasted amazing the Breakfast smoothie is the best."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! Love their salads!!! Always so fresh & super nice when we go to this location!!! My new fave salad place!!! I recommend this place to all my family & friends!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, but like any fast food place you have to double check your food. They forgot my chicken on my salad and spoons for the soups we ordered today. Some days tomatoes were not fresh. All in all loving this salad option and glad it opened on our side of town finally."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time on Monday, and let me say it was nothing less than amazing. I saw that their add on facebook, and my boyfriend who Uber's said he was meaning to tell me about it because I am Vegan due to allergies, so it can be hard to find quick, cheap, good food. It was so good, fresh, and the staff was incredibly sweet. My boyfriend who doesn't even touch anything green enjoyed it so much that we have been back 4 times now since Monday! It's just down the street from my house and extremely cheap for great food. I'm thankful there are wholesome places like this. I wish their were more! We look forward to more salad adventures soon!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for Salad and Go to open.  I was there on their first day and I have to say, that first salad was a little disappointing.  My Chicken Caesar Salad was so salty I could barely eat it and the diet cola, oh my, let's just say it's a good thing I'm trying to kick the diet soda habit.  Anyway, I knew they were a new business and figured I'd have to go back and give them another chance. I am SO very glad I did.  I ordered the same Chicken Caesar Salad but this time I got the dressing on the side.  What a difference; it was delicious!  I will be a forever customer now with my dressing on the side.  I am always on the go, always eating fast food so it's great to have a healthy alternative."}
{"text":"Always fresh and crisp. Service is friendly and polite. Great place, my wife and I split a salad and always have plenty. Love the cucumber lemonade!"}
{"text":"So, I'm in love with this place! I went here three times in less than 2 days.   The spinach breakfast burrito on a honey whole wheat tortilla is my favorite breakfast burrito, hands down. It comes with loads of spinach, egg whites, avocado, salsa and a little bit of cheese. It's not dry at all, but also not soggy. Just the perfect amount of deliciousness!   While I love this place, the green tropical smoothie was recommended to me and I didn't care for it too much. I also added the pea powder and I think that's what ruined it. Next time I am going to try the strawberry and spinach smoothie.   I look forward to eating here again in the next week, especially trying the lunch items and the other smoothie. Hopefully, Salads and Go find tremendous success so that more locations open up. I would eat here everyday if there was one by my house."}
{"text":"I love I work for Fedexfreight As a driver there's nothing nicer than to be able to pick up something light nutritious and healthy over a crappy ass cheeseburger I'm glad to have one nearby your house because now you don't feel so guilty stopping by and grabbing One of my favorites I started from the top and a mini work my way around I highly recommend that you stop by and see them here"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been here numerous occasions and every time I go, my order is fast and always correct. Great pricing for what you get as well.  Also, the customer service is fantastic! Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, very clean locations, delicious food! I LOVE the concept of drive through HEALTHY food, and they were so great about accommodating all of my moms food allergies! So glad to have this option nearby."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try it today. I ordered the Asian salad in a wrap. It was missing the sugar snap peas, peanuts and sesame seeds and of course I didn't know until 20 minutes later when I got home to eat it! So frustrating! Not a great first time that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this location probably more than any other! They're always super friendly and anytime I order my food without something they're sure to take it out."}
{"text":"Love the food and convenience but cannot spend my entire lunch in lines. Road rage from others in the drive through. Idea have a call ahead express lane/line   I won't be back unless it's an off hour."}
{"text":"S&G is a great option when you want a healthy and quick meal. The portions are huge and the price is wonderful. My only wish is that they would have other smoothie options! They had an amazing \"breakfast smoothie\" but it was seasonal. I'm glad they are opening more locations!"}
{"text":"Be aware of BUGS in salads! I love Salad and Go... excuse me, loved. I ordered a Greek salad with shrimp in it. As I was eating, I came across a bug. Yes, a bug. You would think an establishment like this would be heavily regulated in checking their food for big bugs. I mean big. I have attached photos, and you can tell it's dead and heavily drenched in dressing. Never again."}
{"text":"Fresh and easy if you're trying to eat healthy. Customer service is good & fairly priced"}
{"text":"Oh Salad and Go, how much I love you so!   This is hands down my favorite fast food place. How can you not love inexpensive, fast and healthy food options? I like the fact that I can order any salad and have the choice to have it put in the a wrap. When I get a wrap, I get the honey whole wheat tortilla and my husband gets the white tortilla. My favorite salad/wrap is the Southwest Caesar, add chicken and omit chickpeas. The Greek wrap is also very good, of course I add chicken to it. For beverages, I always get the green tea which is unsweetened, fresh and delicious.   Their menu also has a nice variety for kids. Mine usually get the turkey wrap with a cutie orange and lemonade.   The staff is also always friendly.   If you haven't been here, it's a must!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to say that from the time I placed my order to the time I had my salad in hand was about 40 seconds! Easily the fastest drive thru experience and I even customized my salad!   With that being said, this place is the real deal. Great options, super fresh, and reasonably priced! What's up with places charging like $18 for salads nowadays?! This was a really big portion with chicken and my total was less than $8!   I had the strawberry and sweet potato with quinoa and added avocado and it was great. Came with a champagne vinaigrette dressing that mixed really well. Lots of gluten and dairy free options too! I'm excited to come back and try more of what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this place and I'm already obsessed! I got the bbq ranch salad with shrimp and a mint watermelon lemonade and they were both soo good. It's nice to have a healthier alternative that's also quick and convenient. And the portions are big! I'll definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Seems like the T in Teamwork needs to cross some T's in checking the items for those of us in the drive-thru that want to get in and out in a hurry.  Each time I ask for my dressing to be mixed-in it's given on the side?  Why ask if you don't comply?"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's so nice to have a quick, inexpensive option that's also pretty healthy! I love how many organic ingredients they offer now and hope they'll eventually go fully organic. Right now my favorite thing to order is the roasted Brussel sprouts and bacon salad wrap with the spiced cranberry lemonade. I'm going to go through serious withdrawals, when those two seasonal items are no longer available . . .  I order the wrap with no apples, and it's amazing. The feta cheese, bacon, and Brussel sprouts are somehow a perfect flavor combo; it's seriously so good.  The people are always really friendly and fast. I have zero complaints; this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Just tried Salad and Go tonight for the first time and it was AMAZING! The salad was fresh, crisp, and tasty. My husband had the Cobb salad and loved it! The lentil soup was hearty and flavorful. Fresh and Fast....Highly recommend you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I just went there real quick for lunch and this is usually where I will go because it's quick and healthy, and really yummy! Today though I was so grateful because I was in a bit of a hurry and thought I'd grab a breakfast burrito. When I got to the window they told me they had nothing left to be able to make them, which I understood because it was almost over for breakfast time. I order 2 power wraps and an apple pie smoothie, and when I get to the window Morgan only charged me for the wraps and said the smoothie was on her! It was really unexpected but very appreciated and she was so kind and said sorry so many times because of that breakfast burrito lol even though I told her it really was okay!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I got an Asian salad in a wheat tortilla. They're quick and easy. I love that they have drive thru and their menu is healthy. They're very accommodating to your diet preferences. I love this place and I'll continue to go back."}
{"text":"Salad and Go is amazing! I had the Asian salad and it was so yummy! I also love that they have a drive thru! This is defiantly one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Healthy fast food, what a great concept! There's so much I love about it. Any salad you can turn into a wrap and they have a rotating seasonal menu too. As a vegetarian I love that most of their items come without a protein but you can add one in at around 2$, and they have mock chicken. Also great portion sizes for 6$ salads. The service is always quick and friendly. Throw in the convenience of a drive thru or walk up window and really what's not to love?!"}
{"text":"This place is legit and glad I found it this weekend while in Surprise, AZ for Spring Training."}
{"text":"Every salad I've tried here is pretty awesome. The only thing I haven't liked in my salad was the fresh cheese in the Caprese salad, but then again I don't like fresh cheese and must've looked over the fact that this salad came with it. The smoothies are also good. I always add the pea protein in mine. My wife also loves their salads and green tea. Thanks for giving us a healthy drive-thru for on-the-go meals."}
{"text":"I usually love you guys. But I've noticed you don't clean your shrimp very good. I'm not sure where you get them from but someone needs to learn how to clean shrimp. No one wants to eat shrimp poop in their salad :("}
{"text":"I cannot believe how fast they make these salads. I was the 4th car in line and only waited a few min, incredible  job during the lunch rush! The salads are great, good portion, easy on the wallet! This is quickly becoming my favorite place for those hot summer days!"}
{"text":"Ok this is the best idea drive thru salads!   I've now checked this out three times, so far so good, actually so so great!  Good prices, perfect size portions plenty of food I'm a big eater and I'm satisfied with the portion.  Very fast service if it's not made they whip it up ASAP !! Honestly I could eat there there four days a week .. lots of healthy choices and extra goodies there too.. I'm glad to see these are popping up around town and now I've got one near me so I'm stoked. Great concept and excellent results."}
{"text":"Fast & great shaker boxes for the salads! I've been twice to this location and so far I've been pretty pleased."}
{"text":"Just writing another review - giving a shout out to a place we all love! This is our families go to about once a week when my hubby or I just don't feel like cooking and everyone is hungry! Love that it's gluten free, lots of organic (thank you), and priced just right that it doesn't break the bank. My one daughter who just won't do salads ever, gets the breakfast smoothie (love that you serve that all day) with almond milk instead of the sugary chocolate milk. So I feel good that at least she's getting some good stuff too. Thanks guys for what you do. We love you!"}
{"text":"Good portions, really good salad, kids meals have a lot of options, and the green smoothie I tried was good. Great alternative to salty, greasy fast food."}
{"text":"FRESH salad and lots of it, made the way you ask.  So fast and easy. Just drive through, order and drive up to the window for it. Done. My go-to place for salad in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's so convenient and the choices are so healthy.   Everything is so fresh and tasty.  The staff is helpful and efficient.   It's a regular on our rotation of to go dinners!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The employees are friendly, food is good, and Adam the manager is always so friendly, and knows his customers by name. I'll definitely  be back. :)"}
{"text":"The southwestern Caesar is literally my favorite food! I love mixing proteins or adding a honey wheat wrap. Sometimes Ill splurge for a lemonade! Love their model, food, and the quality! Go Salad and Go!"}
{"text":"Caleb is the best! I came here 30 mins before close and I have never had such fast and friendly service. I will definitely be back!!! Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"So glad we have a new healthy-eating option in Surprise!!! As expected, there was a bit of a line at the drive-thru but it moved very quickly.   The hubs and I both tried the seasonal Beet and Quinoa salad. Delish!! Ingredients were very fresh and it had the perfect amount of dressing. The only thing I didn't care for was the chicken. It was very dry and some pieces were actually tough.   Service was fast and friendly.   I will definitely return but will likely try the shrimp next time instead."}
{"text":"This salad was delicious!  Very fast and easy to order too. I had some charges and they got them right. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing is delicious. It's a very price salad for the price. A salad like this at a sit down restaurant would definitely cost over $10.  I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Fast. Reasonably priced.  The roasted sweet potato and strawberry salad was insanely good.  Big salad and first time trying in I ate the whole thing.  We need more of these as options besides the usual artery clogging chains."}
{"text":"Love my Salad and Go!  Great selection of food, fast service, friendly staff.  I go at least once per week, and I think I maybe once had a problem with my order which they quickly fixed.  New items added to the menu which are nice.  And the craziest part, they're working on lowering their already very reasonable prices.  A company that actually cares about their customers, nice!"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and in Phoenix for work. I just wanted something light for dinner, and found this place on Yelp. Absolutely awesome, bummed there aren't any near me in Pittsburgh! Peach mango ginger lemonade... Fantastic. Mixed greens and apple salad + chicken... Excellent. Quick! So quick, drive thru and out. Loved this place."}
{"text":"I have always loved Salad and Go since they opened in Phoenix. I'm very happy there's one in Surprise. The best idea for healthy food options on the go. I wish their Jalapeño salad was not seasonal and full time."}
{"text":"Had the soup and it was delish. I enjoyed their cold brew as well. Next time I hope to buy their salad. Wish they had more dairy free options. The patio outside is a nice idea but it's kind of awkward to sit outside when there is a line of cars right next to you with idle drivers staring. A little wall would help!"}
{"text":"Love it! We live about 9 miles from here but still make the drive. The salads are very fresh and high quality. It may seem a little high in price after adding protein (chicken, steak, prawns etc) but it really isn't; you could make two meals out of if you wanted to. Just have them do the dressing on the side (with an extra) rather then toss it in and it will keep long enough to have the next day. My wife and I wish they would open one south of the San Tan 202 to save a 30 min round trip drive."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for the family because it is fast, healthy, and delicious. I went here with my wife and we both ordered a salad that left us full for hours. It was healthy and came with generous portion of chicken. It also was reasonably priced. We paid $15 for two salads. Also the service is fast. We ordered and ate in less than 30 minutes.   Also it has a great childrens menu. Unfortunately most fast food places only offer fried foods on their children's menu. This place provided healthy options and i really appreciate that. I will def. be a frequent customer here when i am in the area!"}
{"text":"Would like to have seen more low carb options- the salads were all over 20g carbs and sweeteners to the juices, but they were open to modifications!  Any other locations? Near SCNM on 101 and Broadway would do great!"}
{"text":"Best salad...EVER!! Seasonal roasted brussel sprouts plus the right amount of everything else, and thus huge salad was GONE! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for a delicious & nutritious fast food option!!! I felt like Super Woman the rest of the day instead of needing a nap! ;-)"}
{"text":"Hooray!!  Healthy fast food... what a concept!  Had a fantastic salad here... and kept on running my errands!  Other fast food attempt the salad thing and some come close but nothing like this place.  This is the only business I've bookmarked in Yelp so I can plan future errand runs to include a stop here...THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic, refreshing alternative to burgers or pizza!!!  This food is excellent - super fresh and tasty.  My family tried the BBQ Ranch salad and the Roasted Sweet Potato with Strawberry salad - both really delicious.  Very large portions!  We also got items from the specials menu: the veg chili is outstanding, filling, and spicy in just the right way, and the chicken and wild rice soup really tasty - no watery broth here!  I tried the cucumber mint lemonade - not my favorite.  Also tried the chia seed parfait as a shared \"dessert\"...  YUM.  They do desperately need some kind of awning or other sunblock for the walk up window and outdoor seating area for the dinner hour.  But... it's super good food less than 5 miles from home, and reasonably priced, so we will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and delicious.  I will be back again. The Cobb with chicken is awesome and they have great lemonade too."}
{"text":"I love this place! Finally a healthy option in my neighborhood. Great customer service and yummy salad and wrap options! Also went for breakfast and got a peanut butter wrap and was full all day! This place is favorite drive thru!"}
{"text":"I LOVE and I mean absolutely love Salad and GO. From their smoothies to their soups - everything is amazing! The salads are so fresh and the dressings are light and delicious.   Salad and go is really making fresh healthy food easy. At first I was skeptical but the salads are huge and delish!! I recommend this location to everyone I come into contact with.   The customer service is amaxing and they are so fast at this location. Just like every restaurant sometimes there are mistakes in my 30+ visits I have not had one yet. Give them a chance!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Very healthy and delicious salads and wraps. My new favorite place and the best part is they have a drive through. Staff is very friendly, professional and are ready to answer any question you may have. Very clean place. My fav is Cobb salad and BBQ Ranch with Chicken in a honey wheat wrap."}
{"text":"I would have definitely of given this place five stars until today. Today I went looking forward to getting their breakfast smoothie as I had been talking about it so my friend was also excited to try it. When we got their we found out that on weekends not only do they not open until 1030 but they do not serve breakfast on weekends! Who does not serve breakfast on weekends! So we settled for their smoothie of the month special which was aweful! We both tossed ours. Other than that we have had no bad experience with their salads which are tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am a new piscatarian and I am so happy to have found a place that has a delicious huge salad selection With tons of veggies for an affordable price. But here is my problem, the Shrimp is never de-pooped or De-Veined. I can stand eating there shit and veins. It grosses me out! More Vegan options would be great too. Thank you!!! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Sadly places start out great and eventually start to go downhill.  Salads and Go ...... don't ruin a great thing! Been to this location quite a few times now, always opting for the Cobb Salad with Steak. Tonight I tried a bowl of the delicious Southwest Chicken soup, problem ... a $3.99 bowl of soup and barely half full??? Their blue cheese dressing was half full, not enough for the whole salad?? And sadly the steak is ALOT less that they were giving when starting out.  Don't want to lose interest, I'll try one more time and see  I had a 5 star review before, sorry when I updated this it disappeared?"}
{"text":"I really did salad and go. I rarely use a drive-through but I was on the way to campus and needed something to eat quickly. I really enjoyed my chicken Caesar wrap. I do wish there were a few more side dish options. I look forward to swinging back through the next time I'm nearby."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time to grab a salad for lunch. I ordered the Asian Salad and added tofu to it. I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the size of the salad, freshness of ingredients and the amount of toppings that would be included, all for the low price of $8.11. I was more than pleasantly surprised!!  This salad is REALLY comprehensive!  The lettuce was all very fresh and crisp, the pineapple was juicy and sweet and not from a can, there was ample edamame and just the right amount of green onions and shredded carrots. Typically when places offer the option to add protein, the portion is very small - maybe an ounce or so. Not the case at Salad & Go!  They are very generous across the board. The tofu is marinated in some Asian flavors so it paired well with the Asian salad. I'd love to see some other tofu marinades that would pair well with the other salads.   All in all, I'd say this is a best bet for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The service is always great, the lines always quick including when at front and the salads are very tasty and refreshing. I just wish they had more of a selection of salads than they already do. The sparkling fountain sodas are great to have with your salads, try the lemon lime, it's just like sprite but not as sugary and less calories."}
{"text":"Love Salad & Go, I usually go through the drive-thru which tends to be on the slower side (reason 4 not 5 stars) I love their seasonal salads and dressings as well as the Cobb salad. I always get a mixture of the lemonades which quench my thirst every time!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location a lot (1-2 times a week). Well not anymore. I order the same thing every time yet it seems to be prepared differently each time. A couple weeks ago I ordered my normal wrap add extra avocado. I paid the up charge and when I got home and started to eat noticed NO avocado at all. So the next week I kindly mention to the girl in the window could she make sure it has the avocado because last time I ordered extra, paid for extra and got none. She apologized and said I'll have them add it to your wrap today. Ok, thanks. Guess what? NO avocado! So today I give them one last chance... ordered my BBQ ranch wrap with chicken (chicken is more mind you). Today I get NO avocado and NO chicken. I am officially done! It's clear whoever is in charge or making orders cannot read or thinks they are funny because you just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"the salad was great but i paid for a full salad so idk why the avocado was missing from my bbq ranch salad thats the best part, from now on i'm checking my order before i leave"}
{"text":"I just love their salads - honestly... If I'm Going to pay $7+ for a meal, I would rather have something good for me than a burger, fries, and crap!!"}
{"text":"Good variety of salads, excellent dressings and excellent price for what you get!!  Also VERY nice it gives you the caloric value of every salad WITH dressing.  Heck they even give you the caloric value of the dressings they list!!!  Its a great way to stay on track if you are watching the waistline.  I have tried this place twice and they have not disappointed.  Don't expect fancy dining here people....There is a small patio with a mister and a drive through.  Heck, I don't care if they served these from a cart!  I should have had lunch from here today....For those parents out there, a $3.99 kids meal that is ACTUALLY healthy - options are a salad or a PB & J!!!  Good value and good for your family too!"}
{"text":"This place is super super yummy if you're looking for some light and refreshing food! They serve salad, soup, smoothies, and other healthy goodness. I enjoy the food, for the most part. Which is why I gave them a 4/5 star rating. Overall, like I said, the food is good. However, this facility can become a little busier meaning that they rush through everyone's orders I feel. Today specifically when I got there and ordered my food, the person over the head piece seemed to be very frantic with my order and kept using the cut off line \"And is that it?\" Before I even finished what I was saying which perosnally I find rude. After I ordered my food, it was only a 5 minute wait which was not the issue. The issue that I had was that the salad I had got (Asian) looked old, floppy, mushy, and not appetizing. I didn't even check my salad before i pulled out which I know not to do again. It's definitely worth it but at the same time I would suggest not going during a busy lunch hour because chances of receiving low quality food for the price you pay is likely. I still plan on going, but I definitely learned my lessons!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight. This place is so good! I was really nervous about whether it would be fresh or not considering I've never had a salad from a drive through that actually was, so I wasn't expecting much from this one. Positive reviews on Yelp led us to give it a try.  I ordered a bbq ranch wrap and it was amazing! The veggies all tasted fresh and the chipotle sauce was pleasantly spicy, but not too much so. We're probably going to be moving to an office near here soon, so hopefully we'll be going here a lot in the future. Definitely want to go back soon to try more of the wraps. I do wish they had like a really small area for inside seating as my mom and I like to go out to lunch and we'd love to sit and eat at a place with salads this good. It's a bit too hot during summer in Phoenix to sit at the outside tables.   Biggest downside is I'm a Diet Coke addict and sadly, there's no real soda here."}
{"text":"This place has the best salads!! Everything is always fresh and natural. Service is quick and friendly. Best part is they are within walking distance of my brothers house. They also have drive through how many Salads places can say that. Try the sweet potato and strawberry salad...yum!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly am in love love love with this place. Everything from concept to production is flawless. I was stoked when I first moved out here to hear about this place, and even more so once I finally tried it, and found it was wonderful.  My go-to is the bbq ranch, and it's seriously so so good. The ranch is smokey, sweet, and a little spicy, but the flavors of the ranch also come through in a delicious blend. My boyfriend usually gets the Caesar, and we both always add chicken to it. Today I decided to be adventurous and tried the jalapeño ranch, and it was also so yummy.  The portions are great, easily enough to fill me up if I'm super hungry, but I usually end up getting two meals out of one salad. I love stopping here on my way home from work for dinner, and grabbing an extra one for work the next day.  It can be a little pricy, but for the portion and quality, it's absolutely worth it to me, and the employees are always super friendly. I can't say enough good things.!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this concept. All the food is fresh and amazing. The smoothies are pretty yummy also."}
{"text":"So good. Amazing and generous Cobb salad. Seems like the keep the prices lower by not having an inside eating area. Fine with me. Sat in my car with the Doors blasting and thoroughly enjoyed my salad. You can't see it in the pic because it was tossed in but the blue cheese and egg was plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"After months of thinking \"drive - thru salad? No thanks!\" I decided to give salad and go a try. I had the mixed greens with Apple wrap with chicken. It was amazing.so many flavors that I wouldn't think to mix, but they're awesome together. That salad is all I want to eat now! My friend got the Greek salad and that was delicious too. Everything tastes very fresh too. I see myself picking up lunch or dinner here a lot from now on."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I would eat every meal here if I could. My favorites are the mixed greens with apple and the Greek wrap. Their lemonade is also delicious as are their smoothies. (Super filling too)  I don't really care for the chicken they use, so I get it without - no big deal though. Even when the drive thru line is long, it moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I love their salads and drinks... However they seem to never get my order right. I asked for light dressing tossed in (easy toss) and this is absolutely not easy on the dressing. Other than mix ups like this I love this place."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place yummie Cesar salad and big and filling. Love my salads and love eating healthy. Found a new place to eat for sure."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have this restaurant in my neighborhood! I've been three times now and tried a different salad each time. They were all fresh and delicious. Also, their protein boxes for kids are great! Both my kids (kindergartener and toddler) ate their entire boxes and enjoyed getting to pick their sides. I love having a healthy drive-through option to pick up on my way home from work!"}
{"text":"So good! The idea of quick and healthy food when I'm on the go or don't have time to cook is amazing. Salads are always fresh and service is always great"}
{"text":"I wish there was a Salad and Go where I live! Service was amazingly quick -- they were super busy when we went there around lunchtime, with a line of cars trailing out of their drive thru. We went and ordered at the window. Ordering was easy and the cashier was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. I was surprised by how quickly our food was ready since they were so busy. I got the cobb salad and it was delicious. My family also enjoyed their food. I live a few states away, but if I'm ever in Phoenix again I'll make sure to come by here."}
{"text":"For delicious Sicilian Italian food, Zappone's is the place to go!! My husband & I stopped in after a couples massage looking for some comfort food & we were not disappointed!! I ordered the flatbread & my husband had a sausage pizza for starters; the flavors were each vibrant & balanced. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had!! The lettuce was crisp & the Parmesan cheese was fresh & creamy with homemade croutons to top it off. The dressing was flavorful & light. We were there for happy hour & the well drinks did not disappoint  The special was spaghetti with a giant meatball (my husband's favorite meal-ever) & was flavorful & tasty. I had the penne a la vodka with chicken; the rosa sauce was perfectly light & creamy & the chicken breast was a fabulous addition. To finish the meal, I had the marscapone strawberry cheesecake. I am not a huge fan of strawberry but this was a light, fluffy deliciously balanced cheesecake with a sumptuous crust, & freshly whipped cream; a surprising delight for my palate!! My husband finished his meal with \"Affogato\": a combination of vanilla gelato, espresso, & coffee liqueur. This was a refreshing dessert & drink in one! The atmosphere is friendly & the decor simple & the prices can't be beat!! For a small family-owned bistro, this was meal was phenomenal & the ingredients could not have been fresher or more vibrant!! We WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!! I had a wrap filled with fresh delicious ingredients. The price is amazing the service was fast. The kids meal was so cute, tasty, and healthy. I love this place. I wish there was one closer to my home. I will be back anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"So glad that this place opened right by my house. It is so convenient when you want something quick AND healthy! I have had a couple different salads and the breakfast bowl and everything has been great. And the best part is how cheap it is!"}
{"text":"I had a Cesar salad. It was boring at best. Ingredients were super fresh. Service was fast and polite. Food was just not impressive I'll give it another try w/a different salad tho."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy, fresh, and affordable food!! Plus they have a drive thru? WHAT? I visited Salad & Go twice today for the first time. After our morning workout and yoga sesh I wanted to pick up a little bit to eat for breakfast and remembered coworkers/friends mentioning this place! I definitely had high expectations considering everyone was raving about it, and they definitely exceeded my expectations!   First visit (breakfast)  I decided to go up to the window and order. The cute girl at the counter was super sweet and patient and suggested her favorites since I've never been there before and couldn't decide what to order. I ended up going with the Peanut Butter Power wrap which she recommended (great choice btw). Comes on a white or wheat tortilla, I chose wheat. It also comes with peanut butter of course, strawberries, bananas, granola with some honey. So yummy!! We also opted for the Berry Quinoa Bowl which was so good! Love that they add coconut and toasted almonds.   Second visit (lunch) We enjoyed our breakfast so much we decided to get it for lunch that same day, but this time we went through the drive thru! I'm surprised how fast it was considering there were about 5-7 cars a head of us and a line at the window. I love that you have the option to make anything a wrap or salad. They have a great selection as well. I decided to get the Caprese salad, no onions and I added chicken to it with dressing on the side. Love the pesto basil that was on the side. I didn't even need dressing! The hubby got a wrap (I forgot which one, but he enjoyed it). Our daughter who is 19 months old got the cucumber pin wheels and gobbled it all down!   I love that this place is no more than five minutes from our apartment and literally right up the street where I work. I see plenty of visits here in my future!"}
{"text":"Very good, reasonable place. I loved sitting outside for lunch. May not be as fun during the winter tho. Just wish they had a restroom"}
{"text":"Here from El Paso so I seen it n thought \"cute lil place\". The people are nice and the salads are big. Wouldn't mind coming here again. Got the Cobb salad and they weren't stingy at all. They also sell smoothies, wraps and breakfast. There are many options and they are made to order so feel free to switch thangs up a lil. OH n add protein to ur smoothies...Happy eating."}
{"text":"It's really the one secret that Doctors Hate.  This is pretty much the only \"fast-food\" that I will eat.  Or in a pinch,  I'll go to Subway, because I personally think yoga mats are delicious with a little mustard and pickle.  What can I say about Salad and Go that hasn't already been said about the wheel, sliced bread, or purses with designer labels printed in patterns all over them?   I could pretty much eat here exclusively.  If I were still a student I probably would.  The service is always fast and friendly.  Even if I go during peak lunch or dinner hour there is a never a long wait.  When I see more than 4 cars in the drive-through I use the walk-up window.   I enjoy the seasonal offerings, but I always end up going back to my favorite \"The Greek\".  The salads are BIG, and they'll keep well if you ask for the dressing on the side.  It's obvious that they are made fresh.  There are always a pile of staff chopping away in that tiny kitchen.  I absolutely LOVE the place!  The only thing I would suggest would be to add more high quality protein options, maybe partner with a local sustainable supplier.  I currently add my own protein at home because I haven't found the addition offered to be satisfying.   But again - the place is great.  I wish they'd open up on every corner.   We need more healthy options like this."}
{"text":"I asked for the dressing on the side so my salad wouldn't get soggy however when I got home it was already soggy. It's way too expensive for what you get. I paid extra for meat and they gave me a few tiny pieces of chicken... The salads are already expensive plus if you want some protein you have to pay like $3.00. It's totally not worth it. If you want a good salad I suggest order from a restaurants and pick it up if you want it to go."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am extremely grateful that there is a drive through that is affordable, organic, gluten free, and dairy free. All the other locations would get 5-stars from me, but this location totally sucks. I don't know who the manager is or if there even is one, but every time Myself or my husband goes there to pick up food our order is wrong. How? I have no idea... each salad has a max of like 10 ingredients and we always say that I have an allergy and that's why I have to have things left off. But somehow we are always having to go back to get something fixed. Not to mention the last time I went I asked for a salad with like 5 Ingredients left off, and asked if they could add bacon to it and the girl told me that it'd be $2 for the bacon. I asked her why when I had just left off 5 other ingredients and she said that it didn't matter it's still $2. I mean, maybe that's policy... but that's the only restaurant I have ever been to that has a policy like that. Definitely haven't been back since then."}
{"text":"Definitley my new favorite go to place, I've been there four days in a row. The BBQ ranch w/ Shrimp in the wrap is my favorite and go to item. I need to venture out and try some other items on the menu. Customer service a has been very good and the associates answers the questions with no problem. The food choices are healthy and make me feel better about I'm eating!"}
{"text":"The drive through concept is truly amazing and so convenient that we choose this place on most salad-craving days over the better salads from other less convenient places.  The salads are all decent but none truly impress.  They are also very lettuce-heavy.  The portions are great and there are enough of the other ingredients but would be easier to manage if they just put a little less lettuce.  The greens are always super fresh along with all their ingredients.  Definitely refreshing.  My favorite salad has strawberry, chicken, quinoa, Gorgonzola (I get feta instead), and sweet potato.  It is protein-packed and healthy. My husband likes to get their Asian chicken one in a wrap - also decent.  I've tried a few smoothies and none are that great but they are not too expensive at least."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast, friendly and good quality of food. A great alternative to a drive thru burger place!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The BBQ ranch salad was so yummy I added shrimp and no Black beans with dressing on the side wrap in whole wheat tortilla. It was really good! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! I love this place. The salads are really fresh. I love the chicken and I am picky about chicken. I can't wait to try them all."}
{"text":"Simple food and they are always willing to let me switch things and sub items out! Great for the busy lifestyle!"}
{"text":"Really good stuff here.  I stopped by and the options were healthy, fresh and creative. It's a drive thru location, with some outside seating. The goal for them is to provide healthy options via drive thru as an alternative to the unusual drive-thru fare. They have lots of creative and classic options for various palates and you may add additional proteins if you'd like at a very reasonable additional cost. The servings are surprisingly generous given that the salads are under $6. Addition protein varies between $1.5 and $2. I ordered the southwest Caesar and it was fresh, crisp and made to order. The dressing was a creamy poblano that added just a little heat that went so well with the crisp radishes and fresh veggies. This place will not disappoint!   I also tried their mango iced tea (unsweetened) and it was delish! It had a little sweetness to it and that was a perfect accompaniment to my salad. :)   I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"My most favorite lunch spot hands down. Organic salads that are simply phenomenal and delicious.  Would recommend this place to everyone who would like a fabulous salad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have said for years that we need a salad/wrap/smoothie drive thru. While on a business trip I went four times.  I love the bbq chicken wrap and especially the breakfast bowl with quinoa. Amazing the food came out fast and if I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! Please expand to San Diego soon!"}
{"text":"Omg how did I just find this place I have been here 3 times in two weeks! So good ... I love salad and healthy foods I had the smoothie and the same salad I haven't ventured out but I have a feeling this will be a regular lunch for me!!"}
{"text":"I'll give it a solid three with possibility to edge higher. Love the concept although indoor seating would be nice option. The Cobb salad was good but the smokiness of the bacon overwhelmed the salad a bit. I added chicken to it, which I liked. Quality ingredients. Next time I'll try a different salad, I think with some experimenting of ingredients and dressing I'll find a salad I really enjoy. If you're getting dressing on the side, ask for extra. The one small container isn't enough fur the size of the salad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I got a south west salad with chicken, the salad we a good size and taste amazing. The prices are good and will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"So you pass by all the time and you still haven't tried Salad and Go?? Ok, so yes, you absolutely need to try this place, but before you do I need to warn you: Salad and Go will ruin all other salads for you. Why? Think about it... every time you go to a nice restaurant and get a salad you pay somewhere in the range of $10-$17 and you get a good salad, right? Ok, fine... Then every time you go to a fast food place you pay... well, still probably $10, and you get a gross, non-fresh, TINY salad that smells like deep-fryer oil somehow and tastes bland unless you pour on their nasty, chemical-infused, processed dressing (which of course defeats the purpose of eating a salad!).  **takes a breath**  At Salad and Go you will get a BIG salad, made with good portions of very fresh (and often organic) produce, and you'll get it for literally about $6. If you want to add meat, about $8. The salad will be filled with LOTS of ingredients. It will put those $17 salads to shame with the variety and the portion size, and it will make you feel like like you've been duped by all those other fast food places selling you garbage and calling it a \"salad\".   That's it though... Recommendations:  -Cobb!  -BBQ Ranch (don't worry... it's not as BBQ-y as you're imagining! It's amazing!) -Greek! (And if you're feeling a bit indulgent, add steak and make it a wrap... all the gyro vibes will come your way!)  Oh! Also I should mention: you walk-up or drive through, the only tables to eat at are outside and well, chances are, here in AZ, you're not gonna want to eat outside if the Sun has been around in the past 24 hours."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, cheap, and great food. Please keep this place in business PHX. It is awesome and if you haven't been here, check it out. I have been waiting for a spot like this for 5 yrs. Any 2-3 star reviews are garbage. Been here 10 times and it is fire. Chris B and Martin H eat Wendy's every night"}
{"text":"Love this place. The soup is definitely my favorite. Salads are big and filling. Some idiot said their chicken tasted liked it was processed. Not in my salads. Their smoothies however I'm not a big fan of. The ingredients were fresh but kind reminded me of the pea green mush on an infomercial for blenders. Love everything else."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious! There meats, vegis, and dressing are fresh. They don't take like they've been sitting like other places. The prices are good too & huge portions."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place even existed. I was a little hesitant to try it but I'm glad I did. The service was fast and the Greek salad was delicious. I added chicken and it was the perfect portion and real. I'm always skeptical about fast food salads because of the fake over processed chicken. I'm glad this place offers the real thing!"}
{"text":"Always so delicious I've tried salads wraps breakfast, lunches everything has been delicious. Just watch out for the drive through curb I've moved left to soon a couple of times an had to replace 2 rims on my car, from the look of the curb I'm not the only one!!!"}
{"text":"We really appreciate the option of a healthy drive through salad place. The salads are big enough that we usually get two meals out of one. The ingredients are diverse enough to get what you enjoy for a reasonable price. It would be nice if they had an indoor seating area for times when I'm not headed home, but you can't have everything, right?"}
{"text":"I tried Salad and Go a few years back and wasn't very impressed.  I remember the chicken being boiled, or at least tasting super bland, and it just felt pricey for a mediocre salad.  After reading so many good reviews lately, I decided to give it another shot.  I'm glad I did, because the mixed greens and apple salad I had today with chicken and balsamic vinagrette was fantastic!  The chicken was flavorful and perfect.  The ingredients seemed fresh and the portion was just right.  I'll be heading back soon to try new salad combinations."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this is the cutest freshest place!  I had the Greek Wrap and it was D-LISH!  Fresh, flavorful!  Love it!  The Customer Service was OUTSTANDING!!!  Outdoor seating and drive through only....I like this place A LOT!"}
{"text":"LOVE Salad & Go! There whole concept is great! This is my favorite place to eat out because I know exactly what's in my food & that it's good for me! I also love that there is no age limit on the kid's protein box because sometimes that's all I need for a quick bite to eat! Prices are SO reasonable! I have been to other locations & have been just as impressed. Keep doing what you're doing, Salad & Go!!"}
{"text":"One of the best one yet!  My husband and I absolutely love this place . We have a chicken Caesar salad everything was wonderful about it The chicken was not dry.  We will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. They keep adding more veggies to their organic list which is awesome. I love that they serve chia seed pudding all day and not just for breakfast. It is my favorite. Everything I have had is yummy. They let you make changes to customize your salad. They let you try a sample of a soup before ordering it. All around great service and yummy, decently priced food."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Their salads are always fresh and they officer a big variety.  If you have not tried their chia parfait, give it ago.  It's delicious!    The mint cucumber lemonade is one of my favorites.    Seriously could eat her every day.    The friendly staff, cherry on top!"}
{"text":"I have a slight obsession with salad and go! What a great concept...healthy fast food. They have several salads to choose from, you can add protein or even make it a wrap. Great ingredients and dressing flavors too!!! The service is quick and pleasant every time I've gone! They have seasonal salads too! Yum all the way around!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place and it was fantastic! There are many options to choose from and anything is customizable. All the salads are only 5.55, which is a fantastic deal considering how huge they are! Produce was all fresh and the service was fast and friendly. This is a great alternative for fast food places. I will definitely be going here again. Heads up, this is not a dine in type place. It has a walk up window with outdoor seating, and a drive thru. However the outdoor seating has misters and is shaded :)"}
{"text":"I got a simple caesar salad with a double order of free range chicken. What I really noticed was how big the portion size was. I was full at the end so it was worth the money. Next time I go I'll definitely try the fall harvest salad since we're in fall season."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, fast, large portions, smoothies are great (some are more like juice). Try the seasonal lemonade.  My favorite salad is the southwest caesar.  It's a lot of Kale, but it is shredded finely so its palatable! Delicious dressing as well."}
{"text":"Whew,  I'm finally getting around to reviewing this place.  What a great concept! If it isn't franchised it should be!   The salads were pretty good,  here's where I gave four stars instead of five: there was too much lettuce and not enough of the other stuff.  I felt like the lettuce drowned the salad and there was a tsp of fixin's that didn't cover anything!  The kids meals were pretty good,  they were satisfied with their meals.   I did love the juices;  tasty, delicious,  and soooooo good!!  The service was quick and friendly.    Well done!"}
{"text":"I love this place and haven't stopped going since I first tried it out. I used to eat a lot of Paradise Bakery salads, but these are cheaper, larger, and much fresher. Each time I am there the employees are genuinely sweet and the food is out in no time. Definitely worth checking out!   My favorite is the mixed greens with apple."}
{"text":"I've gone there enough times to know that the food is great, the employees are super friendly, and the prices are reasonable for the portions that you receive. Every time I order a salad, it's so jam packed that I find it difficult to eat the whole thing!   I like to go there before work to grab their traditional breakfast burrito and I can always count on smoothly going through the drive thru. The employees are very cognizant and make sure you will not be sitting in the drive thru for an extensive amount of time. Thank you for providing great service not just once, but always!"}
{"text":"Best healthy new place I've ever seen since I've moved to this hot Desert. The food is so fresh, made quickly, and every bite is delicious.  I recommend the pesto dressing on a honey wheat tortilla with chicken and all vegetables you want.  The prices are perfect for the quality you get.   EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED. This place is going to blow up all over the country I bet."}
{"text":"I love this place! The salads are all delicious and the service is always great. Friendly staff and fresh delicious salads. The kale Caesar salad is my favorite and my fiancé really enjoys the Cobb salad. The smoothies are also very good!"}
{"text":"Cute little fast food salad hut. The produce is really fresh and tasty. You can drive through or order at the front and eat outside like at dutch bros. The staff is really nice and very patient. They give you plenty of super healthy options. They were very fast at making our food and super nice. Make sure to try the traditional lemonade."}
{"text":"Yummy kale, marinated garbanzos, poblano dressing----can't say enough.  Loved all the different textures and flavors.  My coworkers had salad envy.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 or 6 times. I haven't had anything I didn't like.  All of the salads are delicious."}
{"text":"I'm trying to eat healthier lately and this place is a good low carb option to boot!  When I drove up, there was a bit of a line so I walked up to the window where i was greeted by a young lady with a pleasant disposition who was very fast as well.  No sooner did I step back from the window than i was called for my salad being ready. Too cool!  When I got back to my office the salad was fresh and tasty. If i had one criticism I could have used a bit more dressing.  I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer at Glendale location before we moved so when this location opened I was so excited it's only 10 mins away from home. However, this place is a such a big disappointment.   We got 2 wraps for our ride today: Cobb and chicken BBQ. 1/ Wraps are a lot smaller than what remember and the filling (salad) inside is not as much as before. 2/ they didn't mix up our salad.... there were bites full of beans or guacamole etc. in my fiancé's wrap while lol there s a whole eggs sit at one spot of the wrap and bites withnothjng but blue cheese... arhhhh I'm having heartburns again just by thinking about it! G.R.O.S.S   I mean.. come on, don't we suppose to get our salad mix up before wrapping it up!!?? It's not like I can open the wrap and mix it again...   Service was fast tho I will give them that :)"}
{"text":"Went to this spot so many time during my 6 weeks internship. I think I'm obsessed with their lemonade!!!  I tried many of their salads and drinks... so far there s no complain on my side. My orders have been corrected every time. Workers are really nice and even attempt to know you by first name which is pretty nice. :)   My usual orders: BBQ ranch w chicken, santa fee w beef, Mix green/apple w shrimp, Cobb and caprese by itself"}
{"text":"I never eat salads but recently heard from a friend how good this place was so I thought I'd check it out. All I can say is WOW! The salad was so stinking flavorful! I'm excited to have a healthy option for lunch. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place. The salad portions were large and the salads themselves wonderful. Wish I had one closer to me in Minnesota. Love the idea of fresh, fast and healthy!"}
{"text":"Better option that most fast food drive thru places.  Good food, friendly people. Get the dressing on the side so you can mix it yourself.  It's too much dressing for me, too little others.  Smoothies are good too."}
{"text":"Very delicious salads, healthy and enjoyable meals. I enjoy getting a salad on my way to work in their very quick and convenient drive thru. Their iced coffee with almond milk is a treat and ask for their Power Wrap! It's a whole wheat tortilla with a variety of ingredients such as almond butter, oats, strawberries and honey. Always a good experience, even after countless visits."}
{"text":"When my wife suggested we try this place I was super skeptical due to bad experiences at other restaurants who prepackage salads but wow was I pleasantly surprised. All of the ingredients were super fresh , the portions are big, the service was quick and friendly and it was affordable. Perfect combination for a growing family. I tried the BBQ steak salad and added red onion and extra steak. My wife had the steak cobb and enjoyed it as well. Salad and Go is going to be my new go-to!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Salad and Go.   I got the mixed green & apple salad.  The salad was great and a larger portion then I thought it would be.  I have 2 complaints about the salad  (1) some of the lettuce was really brown so was bitter to eat and (2) there was way to much dressing mixed in, next time I know to get it on the side.  So much dressing it left an bad after taste.    Portion size and price would very good and I would eat here again ."}
{"text":"Great find off of Bethany Home! I ordered the Southwest Cobb salad with chicken and an iced chai latte. The salad was great, it came with a Poblano ranch dressing that was plenty for the salad size- enough to cover the lettuce but not saturate. The dressing had good flavor, spicy but not too much. The greens were fresh, dark kale and romaine were crispy. Veggie were fresh as well, loved the spicy crispy strips on top. Chai tea was good, but wasn't filled all the way? Seemed 3/4 full... Anyway Service was very quick, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Picked up their Cobb Salad with dressing on side..so fresh and tasty.. Asked for extra onions and got none..no big deal...should of verified when picked up order....get 2 or 3 salads from one  salad...love this place as I hate making salads !"}
{"text":"Normally the salads are fantastic from here, but the last 3-4 times have not been so good. The lettuce has been wilted and slimy or there just isn't enough dressing. They've been giving us 2 table spoons worth. I hope it gets better cause  my co workers and I love the place."}
{"text":"First timer with my 16 yo son & we both loved it.  We drove through and no one was in line before us. At the speaker/menu, we mentioned we were 1st timers and were offered help ordering (salad or wrap & meat choices). Our wait was short & the salsa were huge! I couldn't finish mine. Lots of chicken and fresh veggies. Glad to know they're there for a refreshing & light (but filling) dinner option!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place, being on the go all the time its hard to eat right. I waited in the drive thru (start to finish) for 20 mins. When I finally got the chance to order they were out of the protein I wanted. Since I wasn't able to back up and leave, I felt obligated to try some thing else. For the $2 upgrade I got the flank steak added to my order (instead of the preferred chicken). The disappointment came when I finally arrived home to eat it.. I had a total of 4 bites that's included the steak. The dressing on the lettuce was almost nonexistent. In my mind I paid $8 for a tortilla and lettuce...  I realize this is a new location and they are trying to get their flow down, but when you are out of product, with ridiculous wait times, what is the positive here? It would have been nice if they had notified people that they were out of product prior to getting up to the window. I would have left and you could have possibly left a different impression in my mind."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a good salad. Ingredients are fresh and plentiful. Never had a disappointment and I've even tried other things that I may not have before. Good menu and pricing."}
{"text":"I ordered the Santa Fe salad. The greens were crunchy and fresh, but there was basically nothing in it! It was like a teaspoon of corn and a bunch of jicama and that's really about it. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been seeing this place on Facebook and have been wanting to try it for a while so I went today and all I can say is HOLY SHIT! Where have you been all my life? I got the Santa Fe with chicken and my only complaint is that I ate it too fast and it's gone now. Haha. I also got a fresh lemonade and it was just as delicious and our expect to be. I am going to end up spending all my money there. Haha."}
{"text":"I love this place for my lunch for work. I have only tried the bbq ranch salad and i absolutely love It. I also tried the kale banana smoothie, i wasn't a huge fan because the smoothie was a bit to grainy for me.  I think that's just the nature of having kale in a smoothie. The girls that work here are super nice even at 6:30am which is when i come to get my lunch :)"}
{"text":"The California food snob in me is gobsmacked that this chain started in Arizona when it seems like such a cliched Californian concept. Salad served up in a drive-thru window sounds like a joke Woody Allen would have made up in \"Annie Hall\". There are at least a dozen of these places in the Phoenix area, and when I passed by the first one I had ever seen, I became puzzled as to how good and fresh the salad could be in a fast food operation like that. The answer turned out to be 'Pretty good and darn fresh'. I didn't actually drive through but walked up, so I could study the ten salad bowls and four additional wraps they offered.  No surprise that I went with the reasonably priced $5.74 Asian Salad. It consisted of organic spinach, romaine lettuce, organic carrots, red cabbage, edamame, pineapple chunks, crushed peanuts, and green onions. I went for adding teriyaki chicken pieces for an extra $1.44. With a generous container of Asian vinaigrette on the side, it amounted to just 370 calories (photo: http://bit.ly/2DObyPo). It was all quite fresh, nothing like those plastic packaged salads McDonalds used to carry from days of yore for yo mama. Here's hoping Salad and Go makes it to Northern California next year.  FOOD - 4 stars...big fresh salads that are vegan & gluten-free AMBIANCE - 3 stars...looks like a cleaned-up Jack in the Box with open tables at a premium SERVICE - 4 stars...pretty darn fast TOTAL - 4 stars...great concept, much needed"}
{"text":"Not Worth It! Way over priced and super bland wrap, paid for chicken and there was hardly any chicken in there, somehow cost $20 for my wife my 2 year old and I. They didn't give me a receipt either so who knows if I was actually charged correctly. I will not be going back again, the only people who would like this place are trendy hipsters, this place will not be around long, this fad will fade and soon these will probably turn into a Starbucks"}
{"text":"Great place for tasty and healthy food. Better than most of the sit-in restaurant salad. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really had high hopes, but I was disappointed enough that I probably won't go back anytime soon. My salad had very little toppings and there were only a couple pieces of the chicken I added to it. I ate all of the green \"greens\" and threw out the white stem bottoms, which made up about 1/3 of the \"greens\". The salad and a small drink still cost be over $10. I'd rather spend a couple bucks more and go to Panera."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here daily. The salads are huge for what you pay and they use local produce. The food is amazing and you can tell it's so fresh. A must come to place. I am currently in love with the Santa Fe salad. Fresh Jicama and the salad dressing is like crack. Now let me rave about my customer experience here. I was in a rush to work and left my wallet by my computer after a late night of online shopping. I was pulling up to the window when I realized I didn't have it. I asked the worker to Cancel it and explained I didn't have my wallet. She said it happens and not to worry. She then gave me a copy of my receipt and said I could pay it back later. I was completely shocked. Of course, I made sure to come back and cover my lunch from the day before but just that small act of customer service done right has made me a loyal customer. It has also become a reminder to make sure I have my wallet at all times."}
{"text":"I love having healthy options.. With a drive thru! I can't wait for them to open a location in Surprise."}
{"text":"Very upset. I usually love salad and go but this happens quite often. I always ask for no cheese and the non dairy dressing- because I am ALLERGIC to milk.  This location happens to be the worst of them all. When someone asks for something to be taken off it's probably for a reason. I tend to go out of my way to go to Salad and Go because it's a decent priced, quick way to get a dairy free salad- but almost every time I am at this location I have been given the wrong item.  I worked in food services for 4 years and if someone asked for something not to be in their food then I make sure it's not there. Why? Because they probably can't have it!  Not to mention that the dressing they gave me was a quarter full, so even if I had chosen to pick out all of the cheese, there's the fact that they decided it wasn't worth their time to fill a small cup of dressing.  I am very upset with the negligence the staff who was on hand tonight showed."}
{"text":"This place is brilliant! Fresh ingredients, delicious, quick, affordable!   My only complaint and reasoning to deduct one star, is that this business is in a busy lunch hour area with a ton of businesses within 3 miles of its location. My office has over 140 people and we order from different locations almost daily. Salad and go does not give an option to order food for pick up which makes it extremely difficult to pick up a large order for 15+ people. I really wish they would have an online, or even order over the phone option to put in large orders for pick up. Until then, this place unfortunately isn't feasible to add to my companies lunch rotation which is a GIANT bummer because it's soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Very nice healthy alternative to drive thru. Prices are fair and portions are generous."}
{"text":"Salad and Go has great salads, apps, smoothies and refreshing drinks!  Great meal that will fill me up but not leave me wishing I hadn't ate dinner! Our go to place when I don't have time or want to cook! Convenient and economic"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I'm not going to lie, I'm not a salad girl.  I've never liked it and had a hard time wanting to eat it.  Then a co-worker convinced me to get lunch here one day.  I've not only gone back repeatedly, but I've gotten my husband and children into it as well, and have recommended it to many family members and friends.  My husband is diabetic, and it's so nice to have a place to go where I don't worry about what he's ordering.  The Caesar salad with the light dressing and the shrimp is something I actually crave now.  Everything I've tried has been wonderful.  The ONLY downfall is that there is just the one location.  It's kind of far from my work so I don't get to grab lunch from here very often.  Other than that, this place is totally awesome!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy, fresh, delicious, quick, and reasonably priced lunch, this is your place! The only thing I don't like about Salad and Go is that there isn't one where I live. I had the jalapeño ranch salad with chicken today and can't wait to go back the rest of the week to change the other salads. I will be sad to leave Phoenix because I won't be able to eat here anymore."}
{"text":"The best go to for a quick healthy bite. Love their smoothies & lemonades. When I'm in hurry, the kids turkey wrap is a great choice that's small enough to eat in the car but is enough food to keep you going."}
{"text":"Definitely go. Super fresh, quick, and impressive. This concept should have come to life many of moons ago, but for some reason, no one caught onto the bandwagon of \"fast salad\". Salad and Go has very reasonable prices and will put a smile on your face if you're a healthy eater who needs something quick.  I recommend the steak salad varieties if you eat steak, and I suggest getting the dressing light or on the side. The default dressing option is kind of slathered in it. The BBQ ranch wrap and caesar salad are both delicious.  My least favorite was the shrimp caesar salad because I found the shrimp to be gummy and undercooked. I wish the shrimp was served hot or cooked a little more. The meats are all cold, which I guess is part of what makes it quick."}
{"text":"Love! They are so fast and my gosh their salads are incredible! They are really convenient and so close to my work. I'm a lucky salad eater! Really fresh and made to order. Just can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I usually stop by at least once a week for breakfast I really love their fast and friendly service, my favorite smoothie is definitely the strawberry and spinach smoothie and I really enjoy their traditional breakfast bowl."}
{"text":"When I order salad I understand some places water down dressing. I think a better term would be blue cheese flavored water this is the worst I've ever seen"}
{"text":"I soooooo wanted to love this place.  The concept is something I've been saying someone should do for literally decades.  But the chicken and beef they put on the salads is pre-seasoned with some nasty tasting seasonings.  You can't order chicken or beef toppings without that seasoning.  The store says it's just \"stuff like salt, pepper & garlic.\"  No way.  There is something else in there.  The Asian salad had a very strong Thai Basil flavor.  I don't know it it was built into the dressing, which tasted bad.  There were hardly any sesame seeds or pea pods on the salad.  But there were tons of wet, flavorless Mandarin oranges.  There was nothing Asian tasting about this salad.  It had nothing crunchy, like wontons.  Also there was a short, platinum bleached blonde hair buried deep in the salad."}
{"text":"I love this place. The salads are generous and for the right price. I love eating healthy and oh so tasty! The choice of dressing is awesome and the board shows all the calories, fats, carbs to make healthy choices."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast service.  All the salads taste great I've tried all of them at least once. Actually started my transition into better  eating with salad and go. 5 and some change for a salad can't really be beat. Again the staff is always friendly so that's a big plus.  My check ins speak for themselves and i will continue to stop on by."}
{"text":"We had to check out what everyone has been raving about and it was great! My mom and I ordered the sweet potato + strawberry salad and the cobb salad and both added chicken to our salads. Quick, inexpensive, tasty, lots of options...all in all great experience. I'm already looking forward to the next time to try the breakfast bowl or the breakfast rolled tacos or one of the other yummy sounding salads."}
{"text":"Ok team! Salads to Go is the go to spot for fresh salads , smoothies, and a wide array of healthy options. My wife and I typically get the mixed greens and apple with the BBQ Chipotle ranch dressing. The price of the salads and other food items you do get your $ worth. There is no inside seating it's drive through or you can walk up to the side window to place your order. The Salad's to Go that I've seen had outside seating for you to enjoy your healthy food choice. Enjoy!!'"}
{"text":"I love this place. I can order my salad with or without meat. They gave me enough salad dressing to cover the whole salad. I can also order a smoothie. It's easy to go through the drive thru and be on your way. It's easy to get to and you can't miss it."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food fast. The preferred choice if you're looking for an alternative to burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Healthy \"Fast Food\". What more do you need to know. Quick service of really fresh salads. I also like that you can stop in the mornings, get a breakfast burrito and coffee and pick up a salad to put in the fridge till lunch at the same time. A time saver for people on the go. Some of the healthiest food you can get in a drive up window. They have seasonal items that things interesting year around."}
{"text":"I love this place! The salads are relatively inexpensive for the size and quality of ingredients. I love having an option for a healthy lunch that is ready super fast!"}
{"text":"The best salad in town, great variety huge portions. It's a must if you love salad. They have a drive thru of you are in a hurry. Delicious  smoothies with lots of options."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming and I was on my lunch break. I got my order fast and correct. The wrap was so delicious especially their Caesar dressing and croutons! It cost me $7 for a wrap with chicken and it was definitely worth the price and super filling. I will be coming back frequently!"}
{"text":"Salad was outstanding both times I ventured here. First night tried the Greek salad and the second night had the Cobb salad and bbq ranch. Everything was fresh and the most important thing was it was filling."}
{"text":"Had the Cobb Salad in a wrap. It was huge and the price was right. This place is good and I love local and original restaurants. It is primarily a takeout place, but there is an outdoor seating area that is well shaded and has a mist system. Food was good, service was quick, and all in all I am sure to be back."}
{"text":"This is a great fresh, healthy, fast food option! Portions are very generous and the menu has just enough options to find something you'll like without being overwhelming. Every time I've gone the staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly, I've only had them goof up an order once which they promptly corrected. I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always stellar! I usually just come in the morning on the way to work for coffee in the morning- but get a salad every now and then (and I have tried quite a lot of the salads) and a couple breakfast options and their food is so fresh, healthy, and delish- I tell everyone about it! Too bad there aren't more locations! Unfortunatley, I got a new job and this one will be way out of the way for me!! NO!! :'( I will miss the awesome people at this location! If you get the chance- and want a healthier alternative to fast food-  check it out. There is the one on Gilbert and Guadalupe I believe that is sort of on my way to work- but they will have BIG shoes to fill!! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The cobb salad is amazing. I love their breakfast items. I do wish there was a bit more varience, I do feel a lot of items have the same vinager-y taste to them... However, I do appreciate that they do have fewer items on the menu but do them really well overall. Very good quality and very reasonable prices for what you get. More healthy than other fast food options. More consistent. Like that there are seasonal options."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cobb salad and added shrimp and chicken. The salad was a pretty decent size and everything tasted fresh. I was able to just order and go right before heading into work."}
{"text":"Very affordable and convenient. Ordered the Asian Salad with Chicken, and was pleased with the size and taste for the cost. Came out very quickly, so I was on my way out of the lot within 45 seconds of ordering."}
{"text":"I went here. Thursday and had a terrific Greek salad. I came back the next day and ordered a Santa Fe salad, and this time the greens were brown. So I'm not sure what happened within a day but the greens just weren't as good as the day before. Other than that its pretty good"}
{"text":"Fresh, quality, fast, clean, good chicken (doesn't have that day old taste which many restaurants have with chicken which they add to salads). The dressings are good, but they could  improve their vinaigrettes.  If you like creamy vinaigrettes, you'll be happy, but they need some of the more traditional vinaigrettes to get to five stars."}
{"text":"This place is my ideal fast food stop. The salads are great portions, and they are also super delicious! I tried the tropical green smoothie and thought it was decent, just not my favorite. My husband loved it though, and he usually isn't a fan of green smoothies. They were decently fast, but the workers seemed a little unorganized. Nonetheless, I will definitely be going back here since you cannot beat their prices and speediness!"}
{"text":"Love this place but make sure if you ask for dressing on the side they actually give you your dressing! Dry salad is a no-go"}
{"text":"Wow, I am a big salad fan, found this place by chance and boy it was the best salad I have ever had for as less as $6.  I will be more frequent to this place in future.."}
{"text":"I come here often and my service is always okay, employees are usually nice. today there was meat in my salad and this has repeatedly happened to me, when I order I directly say \"no meat\" so this doesn't happen. (Not eating meat is a personal choice, I haven't eaten it in years, it makes me physically ill). I then called to tell them but no one would answer the phone. Disappointing, I'm not going to continue begging a company to make my food correctly ?"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick healthy dinner.  Seasonal salads aren't usually very good, but the main menu items are pretty solid."}
{"text":"This place is never a let down! When in the mood for fresh ingredients, great service, and a healthy meal... Eat here! They have an awesome seasonal menu and can make things just the way you like! At times, the salads feel endless, however, each bite is better and better!"}
{"text":"Tried it the other day.  Caesar salad with chicken.  It was very fresh, nice portion and easy to order in the drive thru."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool concept - it is a drive-through salad place. They don't have an indoor dining room at all. There is a small walk up window, but primarily, this is a drive through restaurant.  As others have mentioned, salad and go is good, and really pretty affordable too, but you have to double and triple check your order because it seems like they just cannot get a single order 100% correct.  We ordered two salads and a soup, and we received the order with the soup missing entirely, and the salad not made correctly/missing ingredients.   As long as you carefully check the order for accuracy while you are still at the window, I would say this place is worth it. But if you are in a hurry, or if incorrect orders irritate you significantly, I wouldn't suggest salad and go."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever!! The menu is SO vegetarian-friendly and service is always super fast, even when the line is long. They don't charge extra for add-ins or substitutes, and the seasonal menu changes throughout the year which is nice when you want to try something different. Employees are energetic & attentive. I hope to see Salad & Go locations pop up and take over the areas infested with unhealthy fast food (7th st & Bell! )"}
{"text":"Wonderful tasty warm berry quinoa bowls. Wished they served them all day! Very greasy and fast drive thru. Have gone back three times this week."}
{"text":"hmmm.  Definitely some good elements to this place...fresh, fast and friendly for starters. Our salad order consisted of the Mediterranean and the Santa Fe, both with free range chicken. These were both portioned well but our concern was that there was so much lettuce compared to very view toppings.  Plenty of feta cheese but scant veggies. Dressings were both tasty but the balance of ingredients was disappointing for our first meal there. 3.75 rating for this location. No pics today sorry folks."}
{"text":"Quick service. Quality of the greens could be better. Salads could be more affordable as well."}
{"text":"Wow that's all I can say! Very fast service,great food and very good customer experience. Would definitely recommend to others and will return soon and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, delicious! It's my favorite neighborhood place. The salads are great size and I love the different salad combos. I'm a big fan of the caprese (no protein necessary!) and the Cobb with chicken. The only thing I wish was that their iced tea was bigger...because it's super delish and I chug them down too fast!"}
{"text":"We stop here every morning for our delicious green tropical smoothie and iced coffee on our way home from the dog park.  Our pet appreciates the dog treat! The salads are delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I love SALAD AND GO!! The salads are a good size and everything is always so fresh! They don't skimp  on any of the toppings, especially the chicken or shrimp. And prices are pretty much all the same."}
{"text":"Terrible. Salads can be turned into a wrap, okay cool. Ordered the Caesar salad wrap. Wasn't great at all. Also, I wanted a green smoothie without mangoes (because I'm allergic) but they said they weren't able to make it because it's already pre-made in the morning. That's ridiculous. Grab the fruits provided and make it right then and there. Anyway. Not impressed. I could give 0 stars but it won't allow me to do that."}
{"text":"I had a chai tea latte. I loved it, it was really sweet.   I really like the concept of the restaurant as well. It is like super fast healthy food, in the same style as a fast food burger place but with HEALTHY food. The prices are pretty good considering they are not just serving burgers and fries! I have to try one of the salads next time."}
{"text":"Fresh food, so yummy, lots of options.. guilt free fast food, such a great idea. You can make the salad's into a wrap and add whatever protein you want. There are seasonal menu is always full of awesome goodies as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the concept of fast healthy food!! I love to always grab a chia seed parfait for breakfast or a quick snack. There is sometimes a little wait but defiantly worth it and you can tell they are trying to work on their wait times. A salad favorite is the Apple Walnut Salad with Grilled Chicken half the dressing tossed in!"}
{"text":"The salads have gone down hill and the last three times have been really disappointing. Wilted lettuce and slime guacamole which was gross. Not like it used to be which really sucks because salad bars are a hard find."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick meal place. I love the variety of salad options. The food is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"It was easy peasy to order. Ordered a speciality salad, the jalapeño ranch salad, through the drive through and it was fresh and extremely delicious. I recommend going there for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I've been wishing for a place like this for so long!!!! Drive thru salads?! Wraps, smoothies, soups and breakfast. I love that I can come through anytime of day and get a fast salad with super fresh ingredients. I got the cypress salad with chicken and the seasonal tropical smoothie. The pesto dressing and huge chunks of mozzarella were so good!!!! Love this place, hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Best salads and soups ever and the fact you can get them in a drive through, makes them even more luscious. My favorite is the veg chili, which is spicy and flavorful, and the Cobb Calais with only romaine and added chicken. Mmmm I think I need to go there right now."}
{"text":"So i am a fan, small drive through with a lot of health options.   There is seating outside during the summer i could not see myself eating a salad in 114 heat. But that's why it has a drive through. I got a BBQ ranch salad with steak would get it again and again."}
{"text":"This is healthy fast food at its best! They've got salads, sandwiches, soups, wraps and smoothies...  I had the chicken soup and breakfast smoothie, the smoothie consists of oatmeal and peanut butter, and although it's called a \"breakfast\" smoothie, they serve it all day long. Now, my A1C isn't crazy about the high carb load from the oatmeal in the smoothie or the potatoes in the soup, but this food is so good until it's worth forgoing carbs for the week just to splurge here. Salad and Go is definitely a change from the burgers and fries routine of the average fast food joint, so give it a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I just went thru this drive thru, ordered my dressing on the side. No big deal. Get back to my office, salad is tossed & covered in dressing with no fork, no napkins & as far as I'm concerned, useless. Do I go back? I paid $11 for this crap & can't eat it. Order #782 cashier term2 12:44 pm 8/29/16. Oh & waited over 20 minutes. It's Monday, sorry...I'm pissed."}
{"text":"Visited this location the day it opened.  Excited to have another food option in the area.  Ordered the BBQ Ranch salad (under $6) which consists of the following: Mixed Greens and Romaine, Corn, Spicy Black Beans, Pico de Gallo, Avocados, Tortilla Strips and Pepper Jack Cheese. Paired with Chipotle BBQ Ranch Dressing.  For an extra $2.39, I added steak.  I really enjoyed the salad and the dressing tasted great, but I believe I would skip on the steak the next time.  Just didn't seem to be enough to justify the extra cost.  Interesting enough concept to visit again.  Maybe I'll give a wrap a try the next time."}
{"text":"Salad and Go is a DRIVE THREW with a WALK UP Window. NO INSIDE DINING. You either drive threw or order at the walk up window. On the website they note that EVERYTHING meats, salad dressings, etc is made in house and is natural and ORGANIC. Salad and Go offers over TEN types of salads that can be made into wraps, Breakfast, Soup, Smoothies and More. They offer a DOG Friendly patio and on my visit teated my dogs to Biscuits.  I tried the Apple and Mixed Greens Salad with added Chicken. My salad contained Mixed Greens, Romaine, Golden Raisins, Candied Pecans, Apples, Blue Cheese and was tossed with House Made Balsamic Vinegar. The Chicken Breast Was well seasoned and seemed like it was baked in an oven earlier and was chilled and served cold.  My husband had a Santa Fe Salad with added Steak. He was very happy with his salad.  Prices are low and portions are large. My salad was only $$5.74 plus $1.44 for the chicken. Steak runs $2.39 at this time.  Really everything exceeded my expectations.  Above average and GREAT Value!"}
{"text":"Super duper fast and delicious! They have kiosks outside to order from when you don't drive through. My food was done almost instantly and it was sooooo yummy and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Although I have been coming to this location since its opening, I have recently been disappointed with the service. My past two orders have lacked ingredients that were menu'd, which I did not realize until I got back to work. On another occasion, I specifically asked for no egg, as I am allergic. After requesting no egg, the employee replied back for extra egg and did not understand my order. Additionally, I frequently order the Tropical Green Smoothie which usually has a dark green color. The last time I ordered the smoothie, it was very light green and almost had a milky texture and appearance. The menu does not list any milk products for that smoothie.   I did wish to call this location to express my concerns, however, there is no phone number listed on their website to do so. I was super excited to have a healthy drive-thru option, as not many places exist. I am discontent with the recent service and hope it can improve in the future."}
{"text":"I saw this pop up on Facebook awhile back and I have really been wanting to try it.  I live in Goodyear so it's not the easiest trek over to Tolleson, nor do I have any other reason to go over there.  So I finally made it there last night to try for the first time.  I ordered the Springtime Salad (a special) and it was quite tasty.  Beets and asparagus and feta-yum!  I felt the dressing and the ginger carrots battled a little, flavor wise.  But overall I was pleased with the quality.  I also had a bowl of the Rustic Italian soup which was quite delicious. I am super bummed about the location because I probably won't be returning for awhile. It was tasty, but not worth driving that far out of my way.  However if you're in the area, it's a good deal!  It's pretty awesome to have a drive through salad option for those times you don't feel like going into a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Strawberry Salad with chicken and it was a very good salad. It was a good and filling portion and it tasted very fresh. I also got a Kale smoothie and that was also delicious! I would definitely visit this place again whenever I come down to Phoenix again. Minus 1 star because there really isnt anywhere to eat inside. It is more like a grab and go kind of place."}
{"text":"Super Yummy Salad Joint!  5 stars all around. Great menu, fast service with a smile, and really solid salads and wraps. Price point is easy on the wallet to boot. Highly recommend!  We drive 10 minutes out of our way, but we always find delicious, fast, fresh food here!"}
{"text":"Such fresh food for such a good price if you are in a rush. We frequent Salad & Go and have never been disappointed. Good portion sizes as well for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Spot on. Seriously. Great HUGE salad quick friendly service! They need more locations... But then I'd be there daily. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm finally deciding to write of a review of this place as I've been the Duke for quite some time.  I feel it's my duty as royal steward of this great healthy joint.   I absolutely love the idea of healthy and affordable fast food places. I feel like many Americans are unhealthy because of the lack of access to fast healthy foods. Not only is it affordable and healthy, but they're the fastest fast food place I've ever been too. I wanted to wait a few months before writing this review to make sure they uphold they're lightening fast service and quality. They have, so they deserve 5 stars at this location.  Even when the lunch line is off the property, you'll have your food in about 10 minutes, amazing. If you think this place is expensive your wrong. If you think it's cheaper to choose a standard, unhealthy fast food place, you haven't seen the price of cancer treatments lately."}
{"text":"I'm from out-of-town and was staying at a hotel nearby. Stopped here to get a bite to eat in the early evening. Then came back in the morning to get breakfast. It was that good!  The salads can come as wraps too. Smoothies were legit. The price is right and the menu is guilt-free. I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! My first time trying Salad and Go.   I'm a very picky eater especially with lettuce. The lettuce was very fresh and clean. I also added the chicken which I thought would be bland. The seasoning on the chicken was great and it was a good portion.   I also got a strawberry and spinach smoothie. By the color I excepted it to be gross especially since I don't like spinach. It was fantastic!  I will absolutely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I got Cobb salad with chicken and cilantro lime dressing. My daughter got the Greek wrap. My salad was very good! Fresh ingredients and the salad dressing was amazing. It's a big salad too. My daughter loved her Greek wrap. We both got lemonade which was also yummy. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato and strawberry salad is delicious. It is so nice to have a place to get healthy yummy salads. I also love they open early and I can stop on my way to work. The service has always been great and quick!!"}
{"text":"What a nice change to fast food. Trying to eat a little better and tried this place out. What a deal the salads are fresh and fast. I thought that maybe  they would be tiny and that I would still be starving after but to my surprise they are very filling. I ordered the cobb salad with chicken and it was great the next time I got the cobb but with steak and was just as happy. For a treat I tried the lemonade and it is one of the best that I have had. You can't go wrong with them the food is fresh and fast and filling."}
{"text":"Food is great.  I always recommend SOUTHWEST CESAR Salad it has a perfect variety, very zesty, loaded with amazing flavors, the dressing is good.   Soup's should always be available from morning time as early as possible (I order soups for breakfast frequently-- Chicken enchilada soup is the BEST! ) especially with the winter seasons soups should be available Early.  I understand summers aren't as common, however it's always a up in the air thing when I come to the drive threw \"soups are ready\" some days \"soups aren't ready till 9\" some days \"it's heating up can you wait.\"   This is my one stop shop, break fast burrito is yummy as usual.  I've tried everything on the menu only one item disappointed me and it was the breakfast BOWLS  It had bacon and egg whites, they forgot potatoes and Everything else in it... I was disappointed arriving to work to eat at my desk before the day began and it turns out that -- it was bacon crumbs  and egg whites. Will not order that again."}
{"text":"Drive-thru is never empty as long as they're open - always a good sign.  I'm a big fan of the Power Wrap ..tasty, warm, and inexpensive.    Smoothies have an option to add pea protein.  It tastes very healthy, which is kinda lame.  If I wanted \"healthy\" I wouldn't have ordered the power wrap with it!  The employees here have always been efficient and affable. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So happy this location is now open! Makes it so easy to feel good about what you're eating! Love Salad and go. Very friendly staff and never have had a mistake on my order. Will be going here very often."}
{"text":"Gave them 3 stars because they're always nice but I went for lunch today on my break ans ordered a salad and asked to add chicken. But when I got back and went to eat it there wasn't any chicken. Really frustrating. I ended up going to a whole foods nearby and buying some chicken to add to my salad. I usually don't even leave reviews but I tried calling and just got a voicemail so I couldn't even speak with someone. I probably would even say this normally but it's really chincy to only give people one napkin. It's just cheap."}
{"text":"Should be 3 1/2 stars the reason why is it is pretty expensive for a drive thru,and felt like the steak wasn't very  fresh tasted old and chewy I really like the idea of having a healthy drive thru. Just wish it tasted better..I will try one more time.."}
{"text":"Best place for a super fast healthy to go! I always get the southwest Caesar, Cobb, Sante fe salad or the BBQ chicken wrap in Honey wheat. Everytime I've went, the food has been amazing and all the employees are super friendly! Love that they have the nutritional facts on their menu."}
{"text":"I have been trying each of these salads and my faves are the Santa Fe, Greek and Ceasar each with chicken.  My favorite dressing is the Ceasar so I order with each of these three!!!  I love how fresh each of the ingredients are and the fact that my salad is ready to go by the time I get to the drive up window after less than a couple of minutes every single time!!!! I am a huge fan!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this healthy and delicious fast-food option!  Drive-thru salads?  Great concept and a great product.  They keep adding more enticing items to their menu, including breakfast items, which I've not tried yet.  I love the Santa Fe and BBQ salads.  All salads come in huge bowls, so they're not skimping on the goodness!  Highly recommended!  Can't wait for the new location to open at Cooper & Warner. Rating @ 4 stars because I have so many menu items to try!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place awhile ago and decided to stop and get a salad! There were tons of cars waiting in the drive thru which was my first indication that it was good! I ordered the Cobb salad, a tropical green smoothie, and a kids meal. First of all the prices are great. About $5.50 for a salad. And less than $2 to add protein. The salad was super fresh, huge, and had quality ingredients. I definitely felt like o got my money's worth. I also love that they have their nutrition information posted and available online. The smoothie was good, but a little too gingery for my taste. It does say it has ginger though so that was my fault. The kids meal was also great! You chose a protein and two sides so I got my baby chicken with cucumbers and roasted sweet potatoes. And it was only $4! I love that it was so healthy, tasty, and affordable. Awesome lunch spot! They also have breakfast so I need to try that out! The chia pudding and breakfast burritos are calling my name."}
{"text":"Great salads for an affordable price. It's so convenient that they're drive thru. No more Panera! My husband loves the wraps here too. My favorite is the Cobb salad! I substituted it for feta cheese and the cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing, and add chicken. It's the best salad I've ever had.   Am I the only one that wishes they were open till 10pm like Chipotle"}
{"text":"I hate to be one of the one star reviewers on here but I was horrified to find what I found in my food.  I ordered a Caprese wrap with NO PROTEIN only to find what looks to be either a crane fly or some other bug in my wrap. I immediately lost my appetite and called the contact phone number to let them know what happened.  I was offered a replacement wrap but I informed them I wouldn't be eating there any further and would just like my money back, which they agreed to give me."}
{"text":"Salads are fresh, service is middle of the line (not great /not horrible).  Suggestions: add a menu board before the ordering station.  I feel pressured to make a decision right away, land up never trying anything new. I need to try the cucumber more by lemonade, sounds delicious!"}
{"text":"I remember when they first opened and I tried their Cobb Salad...I was not impressed for some reason. I'm not sure why... maybe because they just opened and it wasn't good before? A Couple months later,  I started to give this place another try and then another and then another....Then I found myself going here like every week! I tried most of their salads on their menu and I tried their kale/banana & strawberry/kale drink which was surprisingly really good. I must say that I am a big fan of this place now and on days where I don't want to cook but I want something healthy, this is the go to spot for me. I'm actually glad that this place opened because instead of fast food drive thru's there is now a salad on the go!  I'm a little bummed that they don't have their special anymore though...it was the butternut squash salad. That was my all time favorite but their special right now which is the kale caesar is also very tasty!  Their salads are fresh and for the price they give you a lot! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Great salads.  Lots of options to choose from.  Very fast and affordable too.  Great a for a quick bite that's not just a snack."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.   I KNEW I should of went to this place sooner. I usually spend $10 at Taco Bell and don't like myself after, now I spend under $8 here and it's delicious.   Do yourself a favor and try the mixed greens with apple and add chicken. You'll thank me later.   Only thing I'd suggest is giving out punch cards, cus you know your boy about to be there every day."}
{"text":"Go here all the time. Fresh, healthy fast food and friendly service. Just tried the Meals and Go and those were very good as well. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went there about a month after they opened, it was okay.  It was a bit pricey for me with the salad I had gotten, seemed like I could've gotten a better, bigger salad for the price paid.  Also got a wrap and same scenario, seemed a bit small for the price paid."}
{"text":"Love their tropical green smoothies and their salads very decent in sizes but wishes their chicken tasted better."}
{"text":"I tried this Asian salad with Shrimp.  Amazing salad Asian inspired vinaigrette.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Healthy Option  Salad and Go Restaurants do not have indoor seating but nevertheless it's a super fast and tasty concept with nice selections of unique salads that are very affordable.   The salads are so fresh and delicious and at such a great price.  A salad this good and this large would cost $15 in a restaurant however, Salad and Go charges a mere 6 bucks. If you want to add protein like chicken or shrimp (there are more choices) it is only a little more based upon the one you choose.   Salad and Go also offers some healthy kids items on the menu so the whole family can have a tasty, healthy meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"If u are looking for a great salad COME HERE this is the only place I go too to get a salad  It's so fresh and so tasty they also have the best smoothies and i do have a sensitive stomach, so this place is perfect for me go enjoy a great lunch and not have to deal with stomachaches   Most the salads are gluten and dairy free!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, wish it wasn't so expensive but what organic healthy food isn't a lot."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of good things going for it! They are very fast, very reasonably priced, the food is high quality (and filling!), staff is friendly, and they are close to my work. AND they have a drive through.  I had the Cobb Salad with chicken (I've been on a Cobb bender lately) and I scarfed it down because it was so good. The bacon and chicken tasted fresh, and I liked that they tossed the salad before serving it.  The only bad thing I have to say about this location is that there is definitely not enough seating outside. There is plenty of room for additional tables (maybe throw up some umbrellas and misters too?), so the outdoor area could use some work. It does have a nice open and minimal feel outside and overall, but the lack of tables during lunch time forces most people to take their food to go."}
{"text":"I picked up a couple of salads via the drive through on my home.  Saw the little specials board and ordered two of the seasonal salads they were offering.  The dressings were tasty but seemed a bit \"thin\" and seemed a little too watered down.  The employees were nice and were lightening fast- ordered, paid and received the food in like one minute flat.  If you're looking for a  quick place for a fresh salad this place is good if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a healthy option that was as easy to get as the typical fast food burger, which let's be honest is far from healthy! I had high expectations, and to be honest, I was not disappointed. The portion was extremely generous, their staff was extremely friendly, accommodating, and my food was out super quick! I will definitely be going back there again. It's not cheap, but I would definitely say that it's worth what you pay, and you get what you pay for no doubt!"}
{"text":"Feels great to be able to go to a drive through and get healthy options that taste great and don't break the bank."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are no reviews of this place, but this place is awesome.  Super fresh salads.  Everything tastes like it is from farm to plate.  You can customize any of the salads they have.  The chicken is amazing and doesn't taste like that weird processed or pre made chicken breast you get at fast food places.   I've been twice.   The fist time I went I got the Caesar.  The second time I got the Caesar in a wrap and let me tell you that decision was life altering.  The tortilla they used tastes homemade, and they are so soft.  Therefore, if assume the breakfast burritos are killer.  Finally, the real icing on the cake at this place for me is they have Boylans soda on tap here.  I had NO IDEA This existed, but it is a gift from above.  I work from home so having this place decently close to the Seville area is awesome.  It's a little hidden if you're headed north on higley.  You won't see it until you actually turn east on williams field.   Anyway highly recommended.  I do wish they maybe had a meal option that subsidized the cost a little it's about $10 for a drink and salad/wrap.  However, based on quality I don't argue it's a fair price."}
{"text":"I love having a menu with healthy options. I have a few favorites and appreciate the juiced drinks. My food always tastes great, the staff seem friendly and always get my order correct. They deliver food in a timely manner, even when the drive through is super long. I just park and walk up to the windows. People don't seem to like to get out of their car and order food so there usually are  very few people at the window line. I highly recommend the caprese wrap and I get the tropical green \"smoothie\".  Both pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place!  Never has it been so convenient to eat healthy. They offer a variety of options and I love that they offer gardein products for non-meat eaters. They even offer any salad as a wrap for those who have to eat in a hurry, or while driving (guilty ^_^ ).  Next time I'll have to try out their breakfast options or a healthy shake."}
{"text":"I was a Salad and Go fan.  You could call me a regular.  That ended today...  For the third time in a row, they messed up my drive thru order. I drove back today and complained for this first time.  Then when I got home and sat down to eat, I found a very long brown hair in my food.    While the customer service is usually good and food is decent, I will never eat Salad and Go again.  Nearly every time I go to this location, something is messed up.  Hair in my food was the final straw.    I encourage you to go something place else if you want healthy food, or just make it yourself.    You're welcome, because I probably just saved you a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"First time here! Super fast service! I walked up paid and before I could sit down my salad was ready. Ordered the Greek salad with chicken! Very Good! Affordable healthy lunches!"}
{"text":"Huge fan ... can't wait for more locations to open especially on the west side ... I work in outside sales finding good healthy food is a constant challenge.. I look forward to working the pinnacle peak or the Tolleson location into my day... love the variety and the options to add, thank you"}
{"text":"I love Salad and Go. This location (the first location ever opened BTW) is right by my work so I go pretty often. The service just gets better and better every time I go. I really enjoy all the salads and smoothies. There isn't a bad one in the bunch. The seasonal options keep every visit interesting. The seasonal strawberry almond with ginger dressing salad is definitely one to try when they have it on the menu. I read the following article a while back about Salad and Go and think it is important to share:  http://saladandgo.com/blog/i-just-want-you-to-know-that-you-saved-my-life/   The article points out exactly why Salad and Go is truly great! I really hope they continue to succeed and hope they can open more and more locations. Thanks Salad and Go for taking such pride in providing a great fast and easy option for good food."}
{"text":"They recently changed to a \"no plastic initiative\"; which is great...love the idea.  The problem is they hand you your food without a bag so your just stuck trying to figure out how your going to carry everything.  And they don't sell bottled water.   Arizona heat, no water being sold. Please rethink this concept."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  I went  to Salad and Go for lunch with my kids recently because I wanted to support them and their mission of good for you fast food. Yes, the wait was long, but I was patient because they had just opened and I am sure they are still working out the kinks. I love the fact that they don't automatically put meat or dressing on their salads and that you can order any salad as a wrap. A wrapped salad is easier to eat while you drive. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Second time to try Salad and go. We bought two salads in drive thru and again did not receive any dressings at all. Always a very short wait but ridiculous on the employees part to be so rushed to forget dressing. Try to call store and unable to speak with anyone and referred to chat through websight. Never again, to many other great places who care about providing great service to deal with this."}
{"text":"I decided to try Salad and Go on Brown Street today for the first time after hearing how good they were. This place did not disappoint, The gal who waited on me was friendly and helpful which is refreshing and something that is a rarity these days. I had the Cobb salad, added chicken and it was very fresh and good. I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"They're Potato and Strawberry is alright. I'll have to try others."}
{"text":"I had passed by here so many times and finally made it a destination. That was a good choice! This is like the Dutch Brothers of salads. It was awesome and Twyla  and I both raved when we were done. You get an ample portion salad with many well contrived blends to choose from. Everything was amazingly fresh and tasty to our buds. Your can drive through and grab your goods or sit on the small patio and enjoy your eats. There is not a lot of seating outside and , by the way, that is the only seating offer.  The crew there are a machine and pump your food out super fast! We both looked at each other when they called us for our order as we said \"Wow. That was fast!\". Jinx on you I said! This is a great stop for the little bit healthier option to traditional fast food and is located near a hospital and a hotel.  A). I ate to much and feel like I'm going to die (hospital)  B). I ate to much and I really need a nap (hotel)   Go check it out for yourself. We really enjoyed it!  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Why did I not know about this place sooner? Fresh and healthy drive thru, there should be one on every corner. I had the roasted sweet potato salad, amazing! Real food, and cheaper than any value meal at most drive thru fast food joints. One of my new favorite go to places!"}
{"text":"Don't go here at 9:01 even though the signs are lit and cars are in the drive thru. The hours aren't really visible so I got caught in the drive thru waiting for the people in front of me, that was fun. There were people even behind me. The food isn't bad, just the customer service is lacking. Almost laughable that a business would turn down sales if it meant staying open for another two minutes. I would think a place like this would stay open as long as the gym across the street, same health conscious clientele right?"}
{"text":"Huge salad. Got the Greek salad with chicken. Was good. Enough for 2 people. The Greek dressing was a little tart, so try a little before dumping the whole container on your salad. Price of salad with chicken added was 7.00. Which is a pretty good deal considering the size and all the healthy yummy stuff they put in it.  Soups are awesome! Good cucumber lemonade too."}
{"text":"Recently to breakfast bowls have been really bad potatoes soggy less bacon and nasty eggs used to be good I guess a new cook."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Salad and Go!  I bet I eat here 3-4 times a week.  Best fast food salad you could possibly have :)  They always have fresh ingredients with exciting new seasonal options for salads and smoothies!"}
{"text":"So so good. Got the Cobb with chicken. Salad is huge, lots of stuff in it, dressing is yummy. Daughter got Mixed greens and apples and loved it. We wish it was closer. Open one near 101/Mayo please."}
{"text":"I love being able to drive though and get a healthy meal for the same $$ as the gross fast food on every corner."}
{"text":"We just found this place and have been here 3 times for lunch in the last week. We think it's a wonderful concept and very fairly priced. Our favorites are the BBQ Ranch as a wrap, the Southwest Cesar and the Cobb, all are five stars in the world of fast food. We also  tried the Asian and the Mixed Greens and Apples, which we enjoyed, but found them a little lighter and less filling.  The lemonade and the kale smoothie are also noteworthy."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! It's fast and such a great portion for the price. There's nowhere to sit but outside so it's really meant as a fast food drive thru. I got the summer special with strawberries, pineapple, avocado, coconut and quinoa and added goat cheese. One of the best I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"This locations service is lacking... I've come here 3 separate occasions & each time they get my order wrong. Ordered a Greek wrap with chicken today & they forgot to add the chicken... I love Salad & Go but obviously this locations employees lack proper training. I will go out of my way to avoid this one."}
{"text":"I am upgrading my review.  The Greek salad is greatly improved!  Kalamata olives have been added and the salad dressing is better----when they remember to include my \"on the side\" order, that is.   That is the only reason for the lack of one star.  When you order your dressing on the side, you believe it will be there when you open the bag!  Oops. ************************************** A drive-through salad restaurant is a dream come true!   If only they were open at 6am so people could pick up a salad to take to work!   Everything tasted very fresh, and they automatically offered dressing on the side.  Thanks!  So why only 3 stars?    The first time I went I ordered a Greek salad.  It was just ok, which is a shame since Greek is a fave.  No pepperoncinis, very few tomatoes, and were there Kalamata olives?   I just don't remember them.  The dressing was just salty instead of savory and flavorful.  The next time I got a Santa Fe.   DELICOUS!   FABULOUS!   The only problem here is that a Santa Fe salad should have a lot more varieties of lettuce:  add some arugula and field greens.  I will be back again and again.  Hopefully I will be able to upgrade my review next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Every time we visit, our food is fresh, tasty and the staff is super friendly. I love the smoothies as well! This place is super affordable for the quality and you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I love Salad and Go. The delicious salads and nice employees make my day.  Eating here is making me more healthy.   It's a very convenient drive through with outdoor seating.  It's clean and the owners care about us.  The manager was patient with me when I asked about organics. They serve large filling salads for an inexpensive price.  As a single person who has fresh food spoil in the refrigerator, I would like to divert my whole grocery budget to them."}

{"text":"I just got two salads at salad and go. As my husband was eating the salad.. he saw a half live small beetle on his lettuce. This is insane? And really gross!!!! I tried calling the salad and go number but you can't even speak to a live person?!??! I loved salad and go before but now I feel like throwing up! :("}
{"text":"Have you ever ordered food at a restaurant and then you realized that you have forgotten you wallet at home?  Well, that happened to me at this Salad and Go yesterday.  Working at the restaurant industry almost half of my life...I know when I get to the window, I am going to get that look.  I pulled up at the window, I told the nice girl my embarrassing story, with no hesitation she said, \"that's OK, just come back and pay next time when you have a chance!\".  WHAT??? There was no \"oh-what-do-you-want-me-to-do\" look; no \"sorry-I-guess-you-are-not-eating-today\" look; or even \"get-away-from-my-window\" look!!!  I felt so bad taking the salads, but they were for my kids and I really didn't want to experience hangry kids outbreak in my car!  I did go back today and paid for my bill.  It was a nice young man today.  He was so appreciative that I went back to pay......shouldn't I be saying thank you to them???  Nope, I think he beat me on the amount of \"thank you\" that he said!!!  The guest services that I just experienced here was better than some of the Ritz that I have stayed at.  Kudos to great hires and great management!  I know it all comes from the top, so thank you for this wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Salad and go never disappoints me. I try to make it here at least twice a month if not more because it is so fantastic. My favorite is the Greek salad(no dairy) with balsamic or the sweet potato and strawberry. The flavor combinations and easily customizable menu make this place one of my favorites.   They're reasonably priced for what you get. I've compared prices at some other salad places and paid $11 just for a 20oz steak salad. I went to salad and go and paid $14 for a 40 oz chicken salad and a lemonade. The prices alone are a reason to come here. $5.74 for a large salad? Where else can you get that? Nowhere that I know of.   I've never really had a problem with the customer service other than getting a regular lemonade instead of a seasonal one - which is easily fixable.   I decided to drop by at the wee hours of 630am today and try their farmhouse bowl (dairy free) and it I hadn't even finished it before I knew I wanted another one. The smell is intoxicating, and I'm sure cheese and some salsa verde would make this even better. I recommend getting it while you can since it is a seasonal item. Which is another thing I love about this place!   Seasonal items -I love to try their lemonades and salads. Having something new on the menus ever few months keeps me interested and excited to try them. Anyway this review is long enough and I could go on forever about this place. Please check it out!"}
{"text":"This is the spot to go if you want to eat healthy and are to lazy to make a salad. The salads here are pretty bomb though. So unless you got some mad salad making skills come here to get it. They have monthly chef special salad, where the chef likes to get creative with unique ingredients to wow your taste buds. The other salad are pretty much what you expect out of a salad: fresh, healthy, and delicious."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Good salads, fast, nutritional facts provided. BUT and this is a huge but, they've gotten my order incorrect twice now. I live about 10-15 minutes away, so not too far, but also not the closest. And I always pick up a salad and as the name implies, go. So it's upsetting to get home and see that my salad did not come with the chicken I paid for and on a separate occasion, that the order was completely wrong to begin with. Since the first time they got my order somewhat incorrect, I've been sure to check my salads before pulling out of the drive thru... and the one time I didn't check it, it's entirely the wrong salad.  Like I said to begin with, this place is great. Super awesome concept, but check your orders to see if it's right, people!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and very welcoming. I have tried every salad, the warm berry Quinoa bowl, the burritos, and the coffee. They are all very good and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Just waiting for the one to open thats closer to my house!"}
{"text":"This morning was my first visit here, and I was so impressed and thankful for the young lady who helped me, Madison.  She was very helpful and gracious with my additional requests like extra dressing and whatnot.  I will be updating my review later after I've eaten the salad, but I wanted to make sure I left this review to rave about the customer service because it definitely deserved to be recognized.  The tropical green smoothie was very good!  Not too sweet and not too \"green\" if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"\"Salad and Go\" used to be my favorite place to go for salads.  I will never go to this place, especially this location again.  I had been going to this place regularly for about a year, up until I found a finger nail in my salad.  It was so disgusting!!!  I thought it was part of the salad, until I examined what I had bit into.  It was clearly a fingernail, it had clear nail polish on it!!!  I do understand \"accidents\" happen, but every time I even drive by the location all I can think about is the fingernail I bit into.  Of course, I discovered it when I was almost done with my salad which made me sick to my stomach.  Never again!!!  This means they don't use GLOVES while making their salads.  DISGUSTING!!!!    The service was always great, and so quick!!!   But the person that lost their fingernail in my salad, decided to serve it ANYWAY!!!  It makes me sick just thinking about it!    Now, I'm going back to the real reason WHY I came on Yelp - to look for a DIFFERENT place to go get a salad.  It's pretty sad how one person can change an opinion from a restaurant being someone's favorite, to NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We go here often but I'm afraid I will not be going back again. After going tonight and buying 4 salads I got home and one of the dressings tasted awful. They no longer have a phone number to reach someone in store. So I went to return the salad and get a different one. They refused. They stated I would have to buy another salad. HORRIBLE customer service. I am SO disappointed as me and my girls love this place and have never had an issue. Our bill is usually $30-$40. I would much rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my go to salad place! Finally found a delicious fast food salad spot!! I drop by before work and hit the drive through and their salads are sooooo filling. The caprese salad, apples and greens, and strawberry and sweet potato are my FAVORITES! if you want a quick salad and you don't want to walk into grocery store to pick a pre made salad this is the perfect spot"}
{"text":"This location sucks! They screwed up two of my salads at two separate times. One was to be a wrap and was a bowl..the other was completely the wrong salad...the last salad I got was missing greens and about 4 small cubes of chicken size of a dime. I decided to try the breakfast  today 2/2/2018 went for two breakfast taco's one turkey sausage and one spinish..they were both sad. The sausage taco had no egg white no cheese and was wrapped like a tiny egg roll all tortilla no ingredients, same for the spinach almost no egg white and no cheese. I do not recommend going to this loacation. I have given them planty of times to redeem them shelves. ( people have bad days)I have gone to the gilbert location and have not had a problem. This one is closer to work..."}
{"text":"Best salad ever! Always taste super fresh! The smoothies are amazing too :) prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner that wasn't a burger joint. The Asian wrap was fantastic. I ordered with Chicken and I didn't love the chicken but I am very particular about meat. I'll be back to try other options. Staff was friendly and service was fast."}
{"text":"As other reviews have mentioned check your order for accuracy before you leave. We went a few weeks ago about 30 minutes before they closed.  While ordering it seemed that the two guys working were not paying attention and when they handed me the food they said hope it is right.  Shame on me for not checking but I was in a rush to get home to put the kids to bed. I put the food in the fridge and when I opened it the wrap I ordered was missing the chicken I paid for and half the other mix-ins requested.  The salad had the wrong dressing on it (one I would not eat) and missing mix-ins as well.  I tried calling the next morning only to get a sorry and I also emailed a complaint and have not heard back.  I used to frequent Salad and Go but after lack of response to my complaint I will not be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Salad and Go yesterday knowing full well that we might be in for quite the wait.  We were pleasantly surprised by the quick service- we made it just in time to beat the after-work rush.  The staff was extremely friendly and our salads were delicious.  I had the Mixed Greens with Chicken and my husband had the Spinach and Smoked Bacon with Chicken...both were wonderful and I can't wait to try their other options!"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of this place! I ordered one of the salads with the wrap option and it honestly reminded me of a super healthy yet very affordable (usually those two words aren't in the same sentence) version of a Chipotle burrito (that's how big it was). Staff is also super friendly and it reminded me of a Dutch Bros while I was at the drive through.   Food wise, AWESOME variety of really nutritious foods (quinoa, sweet potatoes, avocados, etc.) and they even offer a whole wheat wrap option. Meat portions were very satisfying and I definitely felt like I got my money's worth. All the ingredients were fresh and I honestly was so surprised by how something so healthy and nutritious was so affordable.  I wish they had more of these types of places everywhere!  Great job Salad and Go! 5/5"}
{"text":"Delicious & affordable! I got the BBQ salad and added steak. The salad had some many toppings, the dressing was multi dimensional, the steak was great. Blown away it was under $10 too.  I parked & ordered from the window. Most people order through the drive through"}
{"text":"I love the BBQ Ranch with chicken! Drive thru place with amazing salads? I'm there! This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Love that this place is healthy and quick! Plus it's inexpensive! Been here a few times and will definitely be coming back regularly. Workers have been very polite and helpful with the menu options. My favorite is the Peanut Butter Power Wrap with honey wheat tortilla, so freakin good & filling! The watermelon mint lemonade is really refreshing. We also highly recommend the BBQ Ranch Chicken Wrap! Also tried the Cobb Wrap, which was great too. Everything has tasted fresh and delicious. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Sucks when you drive 8 miles to go get a fresh salad for yourself and the family and you get home and it's not in the the bag. It's not worth driving all the way back there to tell them they forgot to give me what I paid for."}
{"text":"looked this place up while I was at the gym so I had to go check it out. The salad is good the chicken is very good and I had a kale & banana smoothie too!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit. So far I have tried the Mixed Greens and Apple Salad with chicken, Cobb salad w/o bacon with chicken (my favorite so far) and the Strawberry & Spinach smoothie with protein. All were good. They are very friendly and great customer service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through around 5pm on a Thursday. Super fast service and very friendly! The salads are so good here. Way better quality than your average fast food salad. Also, luv the breakfast smoothies."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place as I was going to the bank. It's a small little place where you go up to the window and order. You can't go inside to sit and they have 3 small little tables outside. I got  their BBQ ranch salad. The salad was ok and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Stopped by here twice and satisfied of their food. Both times ordered Southwest Caesar (kale, romaine, radishes, pico de gallo, chickpeas, carrots, pepper jack cheese and tortilla strips) with chicken and beef as added protein, served with Poblano Caesar dressing. Pretty generous portion and tasted good. This place also offers wraps and smoothies. Quick and friendly service even when it's busy. Will go back and try other type of salads and wraps."}
{"text":"Love the wraps ...chipotle burrito size wraps that taste 100x better.    The southwest ceasar with chicken and the bbq ranch with chicken are my favs.    I can see myself trying a salad and go diet."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a quick, inexpensive and healthy bite. They always get my order right and are super friendly"}
{"text":"If there was a divine intervention god, she'd replace all the mcdonalds in the world with Salad and Go's.  But since there's not, you'll just have to get your delicious drive through salad here."}
{"text":"Fresh, green salads coming at you in a drive thru - I love it!  I wish these were all over the place, I'd only eat here.  By this point I've had pretty much all their salads and they all taste so good.  The teas and drinks are also refreshing and delicious!"}
{"text":"I use to go here a lot when I use to work around Gilbert area and man do I miss it! If your on a diet or trying to eat healthy this place is the place. Although you can easily make a salad or a salad burrito at home, it's worth the extra bucks. My favorite wrap is the Greek. The fun part to going here is that you have add or eliminate what you do not want so you aren't forced to eat those red onions. They also serve shakes and juices. If your trying to eat healthy on the go, try this place out! Down side: it's only located around Gilbert area."}
{"text":"This place is fast and convenient for a good basic salad. I ordered the Greek. The ingredients were fresh and the service was super fast."}
{"text":"Sad it took me this long to get here! I had the BBQ salad wrap with steak and it was AMAZING. First bite and I knew I came to the right spot. Had a few bites of my Cobb salad and got it with ranch instead of blue cheese and was really digging the dressing. I also decided on their orange cranberry smoothie which has stuff like ginger and spinach and some other yummy stuff which helped me feel refreshed. Great prices and healthy options!"}
{"text":"My sister and I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and we finally had the chance to today for lunch. I have to say its such a good concept. They make the salad in no time and the portion is well prepared. Usually when i order salads, I always end up ordering more sauce on the side, but this place had just the right amount of sauce that i dont need to order an extra. Its a plus for me:) they have a variety of different types of salads to choose from. Even have soups as well. Salads are fresh and the amount is just right. We're so glad we had the chance to stop by here today and will for sure be coming back quite often :))) it is so healthy and delicious all in one."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day! Great customer service and food.  I had the Caesar Salad with chicken. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and grilled. The Caesar dressing is very good and doesn't have that over powering taste of anchovies like I've had other places. I highly recommend the season ginger lemonade. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my Cobb salad.  By the time I got home 15 minutes after purchase the avocado was BLACK and when I did find tomatoes they were rancid.  The bacon was only partially cooked so that went right in the trash.  A bowl of romain for $6.00?????   I don't think so.  Too bad cause it is a great concept.  I tried the other location ayear ago with the same results. No more."}
{"text":"So many good options to chose from and their seasonal menu never disappoints...except for when the antipasto salad is gone- it totally needs to be a part of the regular menu!   The Greek dressing is good on most salad options, try it on the Cobb salad :)"}
{"text":"I might have a problem, I love Salad and Go. They should have a rewards card because I go there enough that I feel like I deserve a Gold star. At all locations, the staff are very friendly and kind to their customers. They are knowledgeable of allergies and will change their gloves if you request. My favorite thing to order is the Warm Berry Quinoa Bowl in the morning. It's magical. I love that the food is fresh and the amount of food you get for the price is awesome."}
{"text":"Why didn't I think of a drive through salad place?  Genius!  Salads are fresh and fast!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good for a drive through, which is why I'm giving them all 5 stars! It's fresh and flavorful (and healthy!). Service has been great and portions are a good size for the price. So far I've had the Greek and Santa Fe salads, and also the bean chili. Can't wait to try some of their breakfast items. I'll definitely be back, especially since this is an easy place to grab food with a newborn in the back seat."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's a good alternative to fast, unhealthy food. Their salads are amazing!"}
{"text":"Do NOT go to Salad N Go on 99th and Lower Buckeye. We ordered a wrap and it had a large black bug inside of it. We were so disgusted that we didn't even take a picture. When we went back to make a complaint, the employee had the nerve of saying \"poor little guy is still struggling\". He wasn't surprised by the bug either and just gave the money back. No sorry or nothing. We couldn't even speak to a manger."}
{"text":"Yum!! These salads are so so good! Talk about a great fast way to eat healthy. I loved the sweet potatoes and strawberry salad. The staff was super friendly since it was my first time eating there. They were quick to share the most popular salad. I am craving the salad again!"}
{"text":"Just curious why throughout the the wraps are a good size but on the weekends they are half the size.   I love this place but would like to be consistent"}
{"text":"I had such a horrible day today. It was literally the worst day for me today. Well the lady in drive thru was so sweet and nice and on top of that I came home and they had written \"enjoy\" on my box. Thank you guys! Made my day, and! Also, the salad was delicious. Really recommend."}
{"text":"Love their bbq ranch salad with chicken. Their portions are pretty big and the prices aren't too high. I could eat here a couple times a week. Wishing there was one out here in Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"I have dreams about their cucumber-mint-lemonade. It's the greatest creation on earth, currently. Thank you Salad and Go. Take my money."}
{"text":"This will be my new go to place for lunch. There salads are big, fast and fresh! I love that they are providing healthy options for a reasonable price.  Keep up the great work. Also when you go to pick up your food, if you are returning to your office or home let them know you don't need the plastic fork or napkins. This will aid them in saving money that they can spend on more fresh organic products."}
{"text":"This is a great healthy option for lunch!  The sweet potato, strawberry, and goat cheese salad is my favorite and the service is extremely fast!  My coworkers are hooked now too :)"}
{"text":"I have visited a few different locations now. I always get my money worth.  So fast, fresh, and yummy!  Great lemonades! So worth the price for the amount and quality of ingredients. I look forward to trying all the different salads coming out."}
{"text":"This is my go to place.  I feel good when I eat here, everything is fresh.  I frequently order the breakfast smoothie, it's available all day long."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, somehow you get a 15$ salad for 6$ the salads are huge, and sooooo fresh!  The dressings are incredible.  How is this place not on every corner, I think they are doing a public service and just donating fresh healthy food to the community without making a profit ;)"}
{"text":"So so happy this place is here!  Open more please! Big, cold, crispy salads, delicious fresh lemonade and fresh brewed iced tea"}
{"text":"Bravo Salad and Go!  You guys seriously rock!  Great food and reasonably priced.  You did what no other healthy fast food restaurant had been able to do.  It was my first time today, and I will surely be a regular.  I ordered the Cobb salad and added chicken and shrimp...it did not disappoint.  Your mango Green tea was also Devine!    I am so happy that I can still order Fast Food while following A whole30/ Paleo Diet!"}
{"text":"I hate giving such a low rating but after what happened, I have no choice but to give them this. I've been coming here for a couple months and have loved every single Time. Fast service, great food and nice staff. I took my friend here a couple nights ago so she could try it. She got one of the salads (I don't remember which one) and I got a Carpese wrap. She said it wasn't the best but she still liked it. The next morning, she texted me saying she got food poisoning. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a quick and good salad, huge portion sizes. Very delicious. My only suggestion would be to avoid the smoothies if the fruits  are not in season."}
{"text":"Wow...okay... How do I begin to describe how much I LOVE this place? I'm beyond obsessed. Finally there is a convenient & affordable establishment that serves super healthy,lite, fresh and high quality meals!! My husband has gotten the Santa Fe salad twice this week and he loves it. I had the Asian salad the other day and absolutely flipped over it. We've also tried the Chicken Cesar and its really good. But my absolute favorite (so far...I intend to try all of them) is the Spinach & Smoked Bacon with chicken! It blew my mind. I wanted to head back and get another one because I loved the flavor combo so much!!  The portion sizes are fabulous. They definitely don't skimp on the good ingredients and you leave feeling satisfied and full but not stuffed. That's the whole point of eating healthy, right?  My favorite part is being able to see them prepare your food. It just hits home that they are very careful, clean and passionate about the quality of their food that they serve.  My ONLY complaint is that I wished they had one in Chandler, closer to my home. Although, they did tell me they were building more so I hope one is a little more near me. TRY THIS PLACE! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious large salad in under 2 minutes for $6! I really love salad to go. I'd love to see the chopped Salad aka stetson salad on their menu. Such a great place."}
{"text":"I love salad and go so much. So healthy and such great options. I love the peanut butter power wrap. Literally addicted! The smoothies are amazing as well. Idk how you do it, but keep doing it. I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place a hidden gem you can't go wrong great fresh ingredients and affordable. Great hours too breakfast,lunch,and dinner there open we need more around the valley!"}
{"text":"Do I eat enough vegies?  No way.  I have to get all psyched up to eat a bowl of greens.  Rabbit food.  This place opened up just there on the corner from where I live and I thought, well... good for them!  Healthy food.  Boy, that's great... I hope they make it.  It took the persuading of a friend to get me to go there with him.  And I'll tell you...  If you walk up or drive up.. just go and give this place some business because it's just the best!   Check out the kids menu.  Amazing.  I mean just think if kids ate this delicious and nutritious food instead of the fast food we all grew up with.    The selection and creativity of salads is A1.  And the portion is large enough to feed 2 or 3 people as a side salad.  Price is right on.  I had the cob salad with feta cucumber dressing and I just woofed it down.  My body's like, hey! Live enzymes and their yummy!  I can feel my brain cells regenerating as I type.  Just think folks.  What if we give this place so much business that they open another one and another one and  pretty soon there's more \"fast food\" salad restaurants than McDonald's!  Hey, I can dream, can't I?  One complaint I have is the Asian salad dressing is too SPICY."}
{"text":"Please see my review for the one in Gilbert.  I'd say the same for this location of Salad and Go.  Fresh, tasty, healthy food - quick, convenient, friendly happy customer service - There just needs to be more of these salad drive-thru places!"}
{"text":"Salad N Go is absolutely delicious. I have been saying for years that there should be a salad drive-thru and my dream has come true :)  I just happened upon this place when I was in downtown Phoenix and needed something healthy to eat. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this place.   Drive thru was not long at all which was surprising since you can custom order your salad.  Staff was friendly and helpful with the menu options. Oh, and there's nutrition info for everything - even the specials, dressings,   So now I have my yummy fresh salad, but how good is it...  SUPER GOOD! I ordered the butternut squash and quinoa salad with chicken and didn't even need the dressing! But I had to try the dressing. The salad came with a champagne vinaigrette that was so light and delicious. This is my new place to go and will make eating out a lot easier.  There is a location opening up in Scottsdale and I will definitely be driving to that one. In the meantime I will be praying to the dad gods to open one in NORTH SCOTTSDALE."}
{"text":"Was handed an over flowing, messy cup of coffee that spilled all over my clothes & seat. Lady said \"let me get you a napkin\" but proceeded to hand me my card, receipt & salad while I'm covered in coffee before getting me a (single) napkin. No apology. Good way to ruin someone's morning on the way to work. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Great fast healthy food. Love it. Great staff. Great prices. Love the different salad choices."}
{"text":"What a winner for a niche that is sorely needed - drive thru salads! I ordered the Greek salad and an order of Tofu on the side.  I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, I love Tofu.  The salad was a mixture of fresh chilled greens with red grape tomatoes, ripe olives, red onions, cucumber and feta cheese.  The dressing, which comes on the side, was a delicious feta cheese dressing - so good I licked the container.  I think this is a great meal for $5.74.  The side of Tofu was about 1/3 cup of fried Tofu. It was heavenly.  The girl at the drive thru window was very friendly.  I had a fleeting thought to the plastic bowl/lid and fork as not environmentally friendly but I will rinse and recycle. This alternative to high fat, high salt and high calorie fast food is so great that I am amazed we haven't seen this type of business crop up before."}
{"text":"Service was great, a lot of salad for not a lot of money which is why I heard to try it, \"good bang for your buck, AND it's healthy\" BUT It is truly the FAST food of salads, the quality was not there. I ordered a Greek salad- LOTS of lettuce, not very many other ingredients, an the dressing.. :-( Honestly, what makes a salad is the dressing!! The main reason I get a Greek salad is it is one of the lower calorie yummy dressings with the most flavor. Not this one, it's thick, creamy, bland and didn't add flavor at all. I'd rather get a 5 piece chicken nugget and a side salad at Wendy's that has much better dressing, much more satisfying, less calories AND less money."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite place to get a quick, healthy and affordable meal. They have good sized salads. I do usually get double protein because I think a single serving is not enough. My wife thinks one serving of protein is plenty so I guess that's subjective. The food has always been fresh and they have very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this concept! Salads are generous and very fresh! All salads start as vegetarian, with a nice selection of proteins including tofu!"}
{"text":"We frequent the one on Higley & Brown and the salads have always been fresh and delicious. I get the Greek salad, which doesn't really seem like a Greek salad to me but it's good just the same."}
{"text":"First time here and I ordered the seasonal green salad with steak. The girl who took my order was really friendly which good customer service is a huge deal to me. On top of that my salad was fresh and delicious and the perfect size. It's so nice to be able to get a yummie salad to go! I just wish this place was closer to me."}
{"text":"I go to salad and go often I like the price and that it's right next to the office. Today was no different needed a quick lunch so stopped. About half way though my salad stuck my fork in and pulled out a clearly dead fly. I almost vomited on the spot and the thought still makes me want to. Very disappointed I lost this as a place to stop for a quick easy lunch."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong here?  Delicious and fresh salads to go I have been here twice and gotten them in a wrap each time.  Huge like a chipotle burrito!! So much salad I am stuffed yet I feel no bloat. Hurray!! Open more locations!!"}
{"text":"It's a neat concept; fast food that isn't just junk food.  You can order at a drive-through or walk-up window, and there is some patio seating but no indoor seating.  Portions are decent, not huge, but good.  The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.  Everything we've had is tasty.  Service is very friendly, and while not super fast, not slow either.  They have some unique tasty drinks worth trying."}
{"text":"It's my first time trying this place and it's ok. The salad was decent but my Cucumber Mint lemonade was not. I should've tasted it before driving away. I've had Cucumber Mint lemonade before but non like this. It tastes like cucumbers just sit in the lemonade all day. I felt like I was drinking pickle juice and that kind of ruined my hopes of having a refreshing drink. If there is a way to not steep the cucumbers so long, that'd be great. I'm hoping to have a better drink next time around."}
{"text":"5 star for a fast food restaurant.  It is so nice to have a healthy drive-thru in the neighborhood. Makes it so easy to make better, fast choices.   For our inaugural visit, I went with the Asian salad (nice mixed greens, no iceberg!, edamame, shredded carrots, cashews, green onions, and pineapple. I added the marinated steak which was delicious. Not a ton of steak but the price is right and probably the actual serving size of steak that one should eat. The Asian vinaigrette was delicious.   They will toss the dressing in for you or put it on the side. I opted to put it on the side and I'm glad I did because the side of dressing is huge and having it all on the salad would have been way too much.  The hub tried the chicken corn chowder and was really happy with it. Not overly creamy which is why I don't order dairy based soups. Has more of a rich brothy texture but maintains that richness without the bellyache! Yum! He also ordered the BBQ ranch salad with chicken. He wanted it to be a wrap but since I'm not a mind reader, he got a salad. He was happy with it and said \"it's kind of ridiculous how huge this salad is\". This from a man who calls two McDonald's cheeseburgers a \"cute little snack\".   I can definitely see us coming here once a week. Really stoked to try a breakfast option."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with this place. I was there when it opened and will continue to go. The salads are great. They do have occasional varieties but wish they made some permanent. Other then that my salads usually go in a wrap. my favorite is the spinach smoked bacon with chicken on a honey wheat wrap. Recently they've had holidays shakes which you can buy a kid size incase you were curious."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was shocked how fresh and good my salad was. I got the Sante Fe salad with steak and each ingredient was super good. Such a great and  convenient place to go to and love the drive thru . Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am glad I didn't review Salad And Go the first time I tried it. This visit was WAY better. I had a strawberry goat cheese salad and the veggies were exceptionally crisp! I ordered the dressing on the side as I tend to like my salads rather naked, though I am glad I did order it on the side I ended up using nearly the entire container anyhow because the champagne vinaigrette was so delicious!  Fortunately, there was not line and we were able to get in and out relatively quickly. I also decided to try their cucumber mint lemonade and again, I was not disappointed! I am glad I was taken back to try it again because based on my first try it was only sub-par and I would have been able to make a far better salad. This time around, the employees were kind, the food was great and I will definitely be willing to go back and try it again and again.   I am so glad that I was able to have a healthy drive through option, which I'm typically always on the hunt for when grabbing something quick."}
{"text":"What a great little place to get a quick wrap or salad! Great prices too!  Luckily, Salad and Go paid for an ad placement in Yelp because we were five miles away and it probably wouldn't have come up in the serve results when we were looking for places to eat. Glad they did because this was a great place have a quick bite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've known about this place for the last two years and have drive past it too many times to count. Why did it take me so long to try it??  OMG, I love this place. It was just as fast as any fast food restaurant and even has a drive thru. They have a nice variety on the menu and the prices are very reasonable. I will be frequenting Salad and Go all the time now. What a phenomenal concept!!"}
{"text":"Healthy eating and delicious food! Love that they also offer food preparation services! Love!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the concept of healthier food options to-go!! My only complaint is there aren't any lite dressing options."}
{"text":"I'm completely in love with this place! Farm fresh ingredients, inventive flavor combination, they make healthy taste amazing! My go-tons are their Greek and caprese salads but I also love their seasonal like the kale Cesar they have going on right now.  I also like that they are open early on weekdays so you can grab a fresh, filling salad before you head to work. Wish they had the same hours on the weekends."}
{"text":"Been eagerly waiting for this place to open and tried it yesterday for lunch.  I got the BBQ Ranch chicken in a wrap and it was great!  Will definitely be back.  Fills a need as they are way better than grocery store salads and a convenient option without going to a full on restaurant."}
{"text":"Salad looked and tasted like someone went to walmart bought bacon bits, plain croutons and opened a package of spinach and called it a salad then charged me $8. Don't really understand the hype. Btw I got the bacon spinach salad"}
{"text":"We went to Gilbert location and now we have one literally around the corner! So happy!!! The salad greens are always fresh and we have never experienced wilted gross lettuce at their places!  I love the Greek with chicken...tangy and delicious goodness.  Partner had the Southwest one today and was more than pleased!"}
{"text":"please open one up near arrowhead or somewhere in Glendale/Peoria!!!!  This place is heaven!! The salads are so yummy and the service is so quick!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME every time! I always get the seasonal smoothie & the cobb salad with chicken. I was craving this the other day & wish there was one in Chandler."}
{"text":"First time through. The price was right. The drive-thru made it convenient. Portions were outstanding and tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"After a crazy day I wanted something healthy and drive thru (I have a very sick little one that I didn't want to take in and out of anywhere). A friend had posted about this place on FB so I figured we'd try it. Yum! I got the Santa Fe wrap and the dressing was awesome! The wrap was huge as well. The kids got the butter salad and the turkey pinewheels, both with apples and peanut butter and both enjoyed their food. I wish there was one closer but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant !! I had the seasonal fall salad it was one of the best salads I've ever eaten. I HIGHLY recommend it and will certainly be recommending it to all my friends.  I can't wait to go back today for lunch.  Reasonable prices and fresh food.  Only one negative the restaurant  in North Phoenix is a little bit of a distance, Im hoping you open one south of pinnacle peak road."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this healthy restaurant. As I reached the drive thru, I immediately saw a sign with their seasonal specials. Ahead of me there was the drive thru menu with salads, wraps, soups and smoothies listed with bright, colorful pictures, descriptions and prices. I ordered the Cesar salad and a protein to go on it. I ordered the shrimp and they don't scrimp here--there was plenty of shrimp on my salad and the Cesar dressing was fresh and not overwhelming when I ate it at work.  The young man at the drive thru window was friendly, efficient and I didn't have to wait he already had my order ready to hand to me once I paid for it. I will definitely be returning to try some of their other salads, etc. I love fresh salads/food and this fast restaurant has a lot going for it."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service. This place is a great, quick and somewhat healthy lunch."}
{"text":"A salad is like public television. Everyone knows they should and claims they do, but most people don't. I'm not a salad eater. I never order it, but I have eaten a few tasty salads in my day...mostly homemade by others. But this fast food salad spot popped up in my neighborhood and I decided to try it.  Today was my fourth visit and I was actually craving it. That's a good sign.  They've obviously worked out whatever service issues they've had because I've never waited more than a few seconds at the drive-through window to get my order.  The salad is delicious and filling and I'll be going back . This is a place I hope succeeds. I only wish they posted calorie info...it is supposed to be healthy after all."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but they serve this delightful chia seed parfait and every single time I order it, the cup is only 2/3 full...and it's a small cup. It just seems unnecessarily stingy.   Get any of the salads with chicken wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla. Mmmmmm  Service is always very fast here too"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried a Salad and Go location yet you need to. The salads are large and very reasonable. You can get GF, DF and vegan. All choices can be made into wraps as well!  Locations all across the valley."}
{"text":"As always it was wonderful!   Roasted sweet potato and strawberry salad with chicken is delicious. The wraps are huge!"}
{"text":"Great salad and they fresh but be warned that your price will be very high once you start adding stuff such as meat. Low rating because every time I've been I never get enough dressing for the salad."}
{"text":"Power wraps are getting smaller by the day. Not happy with the size they keep on getting smaller and smaller. Other than that I am happy with the service."}
{"text":"I anticipated the opening of this place for weeks since I drove by during construction. Let me tell ya they came through. Placed was crazy busy and the service was money!  Portion size was great. I got the BBQ salad with chicken. Very good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh god i love this place!!! So many healthy options!!! Dont get stuck with only one fav i recommend trying them all and ask about specials cause the menu can mislead. Breakfast items are great too! I can't praise this place enough. Fast, Great food cheap prices for what you get and friendly service!  What else do you want?"}
{"text":"My favorite dash food spot.  Healthy, delicious, and filling!  Quality of the food is GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Omg love this place and all the seasonal salads, soups and drinks!!! The new Mediterranean pasta salad is absolutely amazing. I always add protein and this time I just got the salad without meat!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. you cannot find fresh, healthy food like this for the price. their menu always has new finds to try. i love the spinach breakfast wrap!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and lots of it for the price! Staff is friendly and helpful! Will be back often for fast healthy food!"}
{"text":"In love! This place is a health fanatics dream. They have the best options! I especially like their seasonal items! It's also great that they have special letters on their menu for Vegan (V)or Dairy Free (DF). It's so helpful.  Their soups are fantastic. Always piping hot. The chicken tortilla is my absolute favorite. But the bean chili is also fantastic.  I also love their Cobb salad!  The kale smoothie is to die for! I love that it is so healthy but Tastes so good!  Their ingredients are always so fresh and the staff is always so helpful to help you with your ordering. I can't wait to go back to try their breakfast. I just wish there was a little closer to home! But, I make the drive because it is worth it! Healthy fast food! I can't be beat."}
{"text":"Love it good,  fresh,  and great selections even for my little one. Definitely better than the usual drive thru's.  I got the cease and Santa Fe"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I got the BBQ Ranch and made it into a wrap and added steak. Healthy, fast, reasonable price, what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Found salad n go on yelp, and we're very happy. Fresh crispy salads , great soup and b lemonade too! We liked the assortment of dressings And healthy items in the salads, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had never been before and my brother recommended it. Everything was perfect till I drove all the way home (about six miles away) and found my salad was missing the steak I had paid for... I was not happy to say the least. Overall the salad was good after my wife picked out some of her chicken for me. I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place.  However, friends wanted to grab a salad and go to the house to visit so I went there with them.  I ordered the Cobb salad with chicken. OMG!  So good. I got so much salad and chicken.  Lots of fresh stuff.   It was as good as any I've had at a sit down restaurant.  The staff was friendly.  I will go back anytime I'm craving a yummy salad and want to take it home.  Can't wait to try some other selections."}
{"text":"Love this place I regularly visit for the lunch time menu, salads here are great and it's a better alternative to regular fast food joints. Lemon aids are decent too"}
{"text":"Great salads. Very green. Some colors from other veggies. Fast and easy. Very good. Wish i could eat it morning to night. Highly recomend for anyone driving by."}
{"text":"Awesome, fabulous salads and I am completely addicted to the mint cucumber lemonade. They are fast, I love that you can get your salad tossed with the dressing. Definitely a great alternative to a drive thru Meal, healthier and price is equal to going to a fried food establishment. Thank you for this alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find this healthy drive-through. I had the most amazing Greek wrap with chicken. The service was as fast as McDonald's and the food tasted fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delish, and the smoothies are wonderful and healthy! Everything I've ordered here is excellent. The salads are a generous portion, and their dressings are good and look like they're home made. Plus, they are fast and the people are always really nice. Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Irritated I got a salad and all they gave me was one small container of dressing I'm like what are they thinking the salad is big I didn't realize until I got home so I'm just super mad it really put me in a bad mood"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I come here a lot during the week to grab lunch. The salads are fresh and delicious, they also have wraps and other food. They are fast and make eating healthy convenient! Prices are good too!"}
{"text":"This local is the worst one. They have a bunch is kids running the place. One girl with blonde hair caught an attitude with me and she was the manager she looked way too young to be a manager. Will not be going back there EVER!!! I know it just opened but they need to work on hiring happy people. My smoothie was watery, and my salad was slimy. I sat outside and the tables were dirty it's like they hadn't wash they in days."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a friend, I decided to check it out tonight.  The service was GREAT the food was pretty good.  I like this concept a lot.  I got the Louie with chicken and mozzarella instead of blue cheese.  The portion size was really good.  I would try this place again should I be in the not-wanting-to-cook mood."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this chain and I love it !!Very fresh !very good !lots of flavor in the dressings! We tried the southwest salad and I loved the dressing ,the cob salad and the southwestern wrap all were very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have stopped at salad and go numerous times since they've opened, typically on a weekend when we've been busy running errands all day and don't feel like cooking and they've been great EVERY time. Both of us have tried several different salads,although my favorite is the Cobb salad, and they have all been delicious. Crisp,crunchy veggies, tasty dressing, flavorful meat. We have made Salad and go one of our few go to places for an amazing meal. Oh and the portions are awesome and the prices are good too. I would highly recommend Salad and Go"}
{"text":"You would expect a company that specializes is salads to make good salads.   They do.  Priced between supermarket who knows how long they have been there salads and restaurant salads, there is a good amount of food in the container.   Add chicken, shrimp or beef if you wish for a little extra price.     Basically regular to adventurous salads with some choices.   There is a walk up order window if you want to study the menu.    What I REALLY liked was their cucumber mint lemon aid.   An August day in Phoenix maybe made it taste better.   Not too sweet, it was just excellent on a hot day.    I'll be back for both salad and lemon aid."}
{"text":"LOVE this place and so glad they opened in Gilbert, giving people a healthier alternative for \"Fast Food\". I'm writing this review as I'm devouring my Caprese Salad (with chicken and added cucumbers- delicious!) I LOVE that they have now added a breakfast menu, and not because I've actually tried any of those items, though I've heard they're great, but they are now open earlier so I can grab my lunch for the day at 8am and breeze through the line (seriously, took 90 seconds this morning!) Their passion fruit ice tea is delicious, and every salad I've had is awesome though I keep coming back to the BBQ Ranch and you can't beat $1.29 to add chicken! Overall, great food and great, speedy service. I really hope they do well and I will continue to be a loyal patron!"}
{"text":"The cucumber mint lemonade is really good and refreshing. All of their salads are really tasty and they are open til 9pm unlike some places that are a healthy alternative to fast food that close around 2-3pm.  Drive through moves fast. Have not been inside yet."}
{"text":"We have slways wondered why there were no salad places in Texas. We moved back home and discovered this chain. We got soup and salads and it was good. There were no croutons with mine but i can overlook that. Good price for a seemingly fresh salad."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open up for awhile and I'm so happy it did. I haven't tried anything I don't like and I've already came here about 6 times in the last week or so. :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't present to experience the service myself but my husband said it was excellent, so there's that.  What i really want to review is the food.  First- everything was amazing. Flavor, quality, portion size- in fact portion was much larger than I expected and I passed the rest of mine off to my husband.  I got the caprese with steak- Holy DELISHUM. The mozzarella was SO FRESH. Steak was cooked perfect. You always kind of worry eating at a salad place that serves steak, but truly no worries here. Plenty of moisture and seasoned just right.  My husband got the Cobb with chicken- another winner! Chicken was great, not dry or crunchy.  Everything was super fresh.  The prices are excellent for what you get too.  I wish there were more locations- closer to work *hint*surprise*hint* but since they open at 6am I can swing through on my way to work and grab a healthy lunch-hopefully breaking my very bad habit of eating Mexican food everyday.  All in all-I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cobb Salad with homemade BBQ Ranch (lowest fat dressing) with chicken under $8. Great salad. Definitely a great new spot for quick and healthy."}
{"text":"Our first time trying this place, and the customer service was awesome. Told the gentleman that this was our first time here and he was so great to offer suggestions. I had the Cobb salad with chicken, which is so wonderful , and my boyfriend had the Pomegranate citrus salad also with chicken, which he absolutely loved.  The salad portions were very generous, and filling. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Salads are ok. first time here for the price it's better then getting a salad at a fast food place. Everything is fresh but just didn't love it if you eat there it smells a bit weird outside. Not sure what the smell is."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting, fresh, large salads.  Lots of choices.  Prices reasonable.  Drive through service is fast!"}
{"text":"Perfect to satisfy healthy cravings, both simple and decadent salad options, fresh, fast, and amazingly large portions! $5.50 for a salad on the go, I wish this place was on ever corner!"}
{"text":"I ordered an Asian salad with added boiled eggs and mozzarella cheese. It cost almost $9.00 for entire order. They didn't add mozzarella cheese. The salad was \"ok\". Not worth the amount I paid. It was suppose to be spinach and romaine lettuce only. There were plenty of \"other\" lettuce in it. It had a LOT of heart, core chunks in it. Not going back."}
{"text":"Great Southwestern Caesar salad with chicken. Service was split second. 3min from order to receiving my salad at drive through. There was a car in front of me. They had the same 3 min in and out.   The only ding is there wasn't enough dressing for this very generous salad. My first visit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. I had the Cobb salad. With Blue cheese, bacon, and chicken."}
{"text":"Really good salads, drive through healthy fast food. Great options for kiddos, so glad it is near  our home now!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! As someone who lives a healthier lifestyle it's great knowing we have this place for on the go. My kids, hubby and I all have healthy options to enjoy here. Good quality food, great flavor combos and great service!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! True healthy fast food. Salad and mix-ins have always been fresh, love their seasonal salads with whatever is in season (latest had some blueberries & pears mixed in, yummy) Salads fill me up 2, and I've got a pretty big appetite.  Hope this place continues to do well and stays around!"}
{"text":"I try so hard to love this place but they always mess up my order.  I came here many times after it first opened and loved the food!  The food is still great but I haven't gotten the right order on my last 3 visits.  I am not going back to try again.  Today I ordered a Santa Fe wrap with a side of ranch.  I got back to my office and it was a Cobb wrap - I hate blue cheese!  I threw it away. I would highly recommend you order at the window and check your food before you leave if you choose to eat here."}
{"text":"For some reason they changed their policy, and you have to request salad dressing to be mixed in (which used to be by default). Now I have to verbally request this otherwise they place the dressing on the side. It's annoying and I don't understand the point of this change."}
{"text":"By far the best salad I've ever had! If you're looking for healthy fast food, this is the go to. Great customer service, fresh food, overall great atmosphere. My wife even loved it and she wouldn't eat more than iceberg lettuce when we first met. Highly recommend the southwest Caesar, the dressing was perfect!"}
{"text":"The staff are always very friendly and helpful. Went there last night and they offered us two drinks for waiting a little longer than normal. We have tried many of their salads and they are all delicious! Lots of food for a great price!"}
{"text":"I just had a Cobb salad with extra Bacon from this location and it was delicious and filling. I will be back for sure and highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the service and food have been great each time. I had the caprese salad with steak and the Asian salad with chicken, both were good and fresh. The rosemary blueberry lemonade is one of my favorite drinks!"}
{"text":"Love the Greek yogurt parfait in the morning.  Salads are good, too.  Skimp a little on the dressing."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because the avocado in my salad had obviously been sitting around for a while. It was pretty brown...   Other than the aging avocado, the salad was great! I had the cilantro lime dressing. The size of the salad was awesome for the price. I also ordered the seasonal chicken and wild rice soup. It was super tasty.  $10 for a decent sized salad and tasty soup was not bad. I'll definitely be back. Looking forward to trying different salad and dressing combos."}
{"text":"Yum! I order the Cobb salad here at least once a week. It's actually cheaper for me to do that then to buy all the ingredients and make a salad at home. They never skimp on the ingredients and I feel good about their food. Such a great concept. Now people who normally eat fast food have no excuse bc this takes even less time in the drive thru and costs less than any value meal"}
{"text":"Customer service here sucks! Our \"wraps\" weren't even wrapped!!!! horrible!! So frustrating! We used to love it here but recently they are just terrible"}
{"text":"I really was excited to finally try this place out. There really is no good vegetarian options in surprise, let alone anywhere that is drive thru. I just recently tried it & was sadly disappointed. I got the seasonal pasta salad. It was near closing time but the broccoli in this salad was BROWN & soggy!!! It was clearly pre made, sitting all day. I took out half of the items in this salad because they were old. I was the most disappointed by the broccoli though. Why would you serve brown broccoli to someone? The menu is also very limited. I honestly don't think I will be back. Very disappointed, had high hopes."}
{"text":"Please open one in the San Tan area of Gilbert!  We just moved, and I'm so sad that we are farther away!  Every neighborhood should have a quick and healthy option for lunch.  Great choices and the greek salad wrap with chicken is my go-to choice! Great people, and they always give our dog a treat if she's in the car with us!"}
{"text":"I tried their Cob salads and the new lemon Aide drink... so far there s no complain on my side. My orders have been corrected every time i list this place. Workers are really nice and even attempt to know you by first name which is pretty nice. :) If i brings my dogs they always have a dog treat and water for them. My wife will make me drive all the way from Glendale just for a salad."}
{"text":"I love this place. I would eat here for very meal if I could. My only gripe is that there's no vegetarian/vegan options on their breakfast menu, and by the time they've removed all the things in their usual breakfast fare I can't eat (meat/cheese/eggs/whatever), I get a burrito the size of a taquito because they don't give extras of what I can eat.   Here's hoping they make an epic veggie lovers burrito, cuz that would be fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm not usually one to write reviews but I felt like I HAD to for this place because I'm so impressed.  VERY fast, friendly, fresh, large portions for a great price. I love it and will definitely be back!!  I had the Cobb with chicken and the champagne vinaigrette instead. Delish!"}
{"text":"Salads are huge. A great alternative to fast food burgers. Love their apple juice...Fast, friendly and easy to get in and out!"}
{"text":"Good quick service, very fair prices and great food and smoothies. I love the concept and much better than the competition!"}
{"text":"Best drive thru you'll ever find! So glad they are spreading around the east valley!  Good healthy food that helps those with dietary restrictions be able to eat out and drive through somewhere quick, without the guilt! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Salad and Go is the greatest place! It allows you to drive thru and get a HEALTHY meal at the same time! The convenience and the delicious food they offer (not your typical \"fast food\") is the most appealing thing ever! Thank you for opening more locations to serve so many! You rock! San Tan mall needs one! ;)"}
{"text":"I mocked this place as a drive up salad bar.    I was wrong.  It's actually pretty delicious, and fairly handy.    I think they have something going on here.    I'll be back.    My wife got the asian with chicken, and I got the southwest Caesar with steak.    I quite enjoyed my salad for the price.    She complained that the chicken was processed, and after tasting it she was right.  Then again, my wife is a tough customer at times...  Either way, I got 4 stars for this place;  mostly for trying something different, and partially for a pretty damn good salad.  And I can drive up to get it.    I love the concept, and I'd tack on another star if they can perfect the food a little."}
{"text":"BEST SALAD I HABE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! I got the Cobb salad and added chicken. HUGE salad and a great price!!!  Oh and super fast and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Had this for the first time today, got a greek wrap with added chicken.  Thought the taste but great and it's large, but I feel it's overpriced.  There was maybe 6-7 bites of chicken in that huge thing with mostly salad.  6 bucks without chicken is a bit absurd.  If more chicken was in it for the 8 bucks I paid, I wouldn't think it's to bad.  I'd rather the wrap be smaller, have less lettuce and have a proportioned chicken to lettuce ratio.  I'd probably get this plan next time and add some chicken from home."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great and the staff is nice and efficient. So happy they opened up in Surprise. You can order any of their salads in a wrap and add some steak, chicken or other protien options. This is a great place for a quick healthy option for the entire family. Great options for the kids."}
{"text":"Delicious filling customized fresh quality salads, well-priced with fast friendly service to go. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place ever since it opened. I always get the same kind of salad and I've been noticing that the quality has noticeably declined lately. The chicken has become very dry and it doesn't seem fresh at all, so I dropped adding chicken to my salad. Today the cherry tomatoes are kinds soggy and the mont lemonade tastes more like cucumber:) I hope they turn it around soon before customers turn away."}
{"text":"Love salad and go. Prices are fantastic for what you get. I've not had a salad there I didn't love and the service is always fantastic as well. I'm here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I had a Cobb shrimp salad with poblano Caesar dressing and it was amazing. It was very fresh all their ingredients are organic. Service was very quick. The only thing I have to say I didn't like was their seating was outside and Arizona's weather isn't the best but on the other hand you can always use their drive thru service"}
{"text":"Out of all the salads I've had in my life (3 in total) this is by far the best! The toppings are fresh and tasty, the portion size is excellent, and the price is unbeatable. I'll definitely be coming back, and I cannot wait to try out their breakfast menu too!"}
{"text":"Salads are just as delicious as they are HUGE and inexpensive!  BRILLIANT CONCEPT!  Wish there were more west side locations and had organic options too!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! I have been screaming for a healthy fast-food option (aside from Chipotle) for years. Salad and Go is my favorite place to hit up, when I fail to pack a lunch for work.   My go-to is the BBQ Ranch Salad, add Chicken, with a little bit of lemon juice and salt rather than the dressing.  There's a kids menu, which is important; being that I'm a food snob. If I have my younger siblings with me, I can still dictate the quality of food that goes in their mouth, without food-shaming them upon ordering.  The prices will demolish any argument supporting the whole \"Eating healthy is so expensive, waaaaahhhhhhh\" claim; considering their Salads are shy of $6 and acts as 2 separate meals for me, a grown woman.  I'm all about Salad and Go. I can only hope this chain will spark a health-conscious fast-food revolution!"}
{"text":"What a place!!!!!  I've been saying for a while we need a fast option for healthy food  I really enjoy the options of wraps of salad bowls.  One thing I must add though my sister found a hair in her burrito.....Would like to know how that happened??  Other than the random hair I'm very happy we have a healthier faster option"}
{"text":"Straight to the point type of place. Salad and go is exactly what is it! Many types of salads and wraps! They also have some delicious smoothies! You can go through the drive through or enjoy the food on the outside tables. The employees are extremely friendly, and they prepare your food very fast! If your looking for something quick and healthy I would recommend this place over fast food places when in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Generous portions! Super healthy! Love this concept...Wish there were more Salad And Go locations!"}
{"text":"Spent like $10 bucks on a salad and drink that wasn't even that good...I could make something like this at home. Not impressed"}
{"text":"I would seriously eat here every day if my husband shared my love for salad. My personal favorite is the strawberry and sweet potato salad with chicken. The service is fast and friendly and the prices are very affordable. The best healthy fast food place out there!"}
{"text":"Salad and Go now earns 5 stars from me!!  I have been here several times since my first review and each time, the salads have been on point!!  I've also tried the smoothies and they are great.  I wish there was a little more customization available for them, but the friendly employee explained to me why there isn't (basically due to the time constraints of operating a drive-thru in an efficient manner) Yesterday I tried the Roasted Brussels Sprouts & Bacon Salad and it was so yummy.  I don't even like Brussels sprouts, but I devoured them!  The combination of the B sprouts, thinly sliced almonds, feta cheese, and the crunchy apples....Mmmm...I think I may need to get another one soon!"}
{"text":"So Today was my first time at Salad and Go and I had a wonderful experience. I'm one of those picky customers and the young lady was so respectful and polite. So much so that I ask for her name Nakea F. I wish there were more of her at every restaurant I go to. Anyway Great Job! Nakea F."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously why did no one think of this spectacular idea before? Healthy, reasonably priced salad drive thru. Oh and not to be forgotten, AMAZING breakfast.   My obsession with Salad and Go started in a cool morning with a warm berry quinoa bowl. So feeling good! It'll make you forget you ever had any desire for oatmeal in your past life.   Then I tried a caprese salad and the obsession grew. It's a HUGE salad (seriously three meals worth for me) bursting with pesto and balsamic. And for a little over $5?? Sold.   Then, addiction set in with a breakfast bowl. Anytime someone wants to give me red potatoes, pico de gallo and avocado for breakfast, I am totally in...at first I thought it was odd that's it's really more of a salad breakfast bowl (ie: the tons of fresh spinach leaves they serve up for you for breakfast) but holy breakfast...mix that in with some egg whites and I am SOLD for life on this.   Oh...and the iced coffee? Yum. I am such a coffee snob and I love theirs.   Everyone is super friendly and they even have organic dog bones for the furry kids if you bring them along for the ride.   Grab a salad and go at your next available opportunity, you will thank me (and them)."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh foods! My husband and I have come a few times with our kids and we LOVE it. We LOVE the idea of eating healthy, our kids eating healthy--on the go!! They are all super friendly and knowledgeable of the foods they serve. I'm on a strict diet and cannot have meats that are heavily seasoned and the girls there were able to tell me exactly what the meats are cooked in! Thanks Salad and go, we are hooked and WILL continue to come and gets our meals when we are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Priced Right great flavor ,healthy choices, even their breakfast breakfast choices are good if you have not tried them definitely worth a try I've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!   I have been here many times and have had several items on the menu.  Not once have I ever had a bad meal.  My favorite item is the Caprese salad.  I order it with the lowfat balsamic dressing rather than the regular balsamic that it comes with and I also add chicken.  The cobb salad is also another favorite.  On weekdays during the lunch hour the cars are almost backed up to the street.   They are extremely quick.  The cashiers and order takers are very friendly.  You will enjoy this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Every experience at Salad and Go has been great!  All salad prices are responsible for portion size! My favorite is the Cobb salad dressing on the side. Fastest drive thru around"}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place, food was okay, I will probably try it again (especially because of the convenience at work). I got the chicken & wild rice soup which was $4 in a pretty big cup & good -- filled with lots of veggies but not super flavorful, probably because they don't load it up with salt = healthier. But taste wise I give it a 3/5. Then I got a Santa Fe salad ($8 including chicken) which was also okay. First of all, pretty huge, didn't finish it all (plus I had soup). The chicken in it was a little bit suspicious, seasoned and flavorful but looked like some dark meat pieces and some had weird markings on them. But overall the salad was good, next time I will probably try another one.   Drive thru! And a little area to sit outside, you order at a window so there is no inside."}
{"text":"This place is great for a healthy fast food option!  I had the Santa Fe salad as a wrap and it was pretty good! The portions are big so you could definitely split a wrap with someone.  I liked that they had a lot of veggie options including a veggie chicken product that you can put on any salad."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this concept. Super reasonably priced, huge portions and prompt service. The Greek salad and mixed green with apple were both super fresh and packed with flavor. Did not care for the mango colada at all (tasted like bananas and ice). Overall a near perfect experience. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've tried the breakfast burrito and the Cobb salad with chicken. Both were really delicious. I loved the salsa that came with burrito, I would order extra next time! This will be my go to for when I'm craving something healthy.   On both visits I was the only customer so service went really fast for me. And worker was nice. Looking forward to more visits!"}
{"text":"Good portion. Yummy and fresh. Even my 4 year old enjoyed. Generous on the dressing and friendly service"}
{"text":"While taking a trip to the east side I finally got my opportunity to try this place out. As a health nut I loved the concept. Fresh food that's fast and doesn't hide. For a fast food concept their menu had everything you could want. Wraps,salads,smoothies and breakfast, this place has it covered. The other great part about it is that its revolutionizing the industry and hopefully starting a trend that can last. As a guy who believes that fast food is destroying our nation, I'm glad that this place is attempting to eradicate the idea that fast food has to be greasy and fattening. With this in mind I had high expectations. The food was delivered fast, and my strawberry sweet potato salad was amazing. For that matter, where else can you get a mouthwatering salad with quinoa,sweet potatoes, strawberries , and steak tossed together under a feta cheese sprinkle in under 8 minutes? I absolutely adore the food and the concept, so why 4 stars? Unfortunately the service wasn't amazing. They gave us only one fork and a napkin for three meals, and while that didn't detract from the whole meal, it did leave me not too inspired to make them a necessity. With that in mind I give it a 4 because I believe that their marketing and experience could be better. While that may seem harsh, I only say this because I believe this place could be the next Dutch Bros, but only a little healthier. For it to explode and launch to its full potential  it needs to be a brand that creates a relationship with its customer. In that sense they should borrow a page from Dutch Bros and create a relationship with the customer and a place that we all look forward to visiting, a place that you would drive miles to go to. Luckily this place is in its infancy and will most likely grow into a complete game changer. I can't wait until it does and we can have kids running around with smoothies and salads instead of McNuggets and Cokes. Godspeed Salad and Go!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! If they ever mess anything up on your order, they give it to you for free the food is delicious, and they get it to you pretty fast!! I have noticed that they run out of organic tofu pretty frequently though."}
{"text":"I love love love the salads here and recently discovered the wraps are even better. I love getting the shrimp on my salad or in my wraps but always notice it takes a little longer."}
{"text":"I'm a long-time Salad and Go fan, so when I saw they were building one right around the corner from where I live, I was ecstatic! We have already been there two times since it has opened and have been incredibly impressed. Not only are the solids amazing, as expected, but the customer service is absolutely outstanding. I have never came upon such great employees in Mesa. I have no idea where they found these people, but they are seriously the best! Plus, how great is it to have a place that has salads and is set up like a drive through? It sure beats McDonald's."}
{"text":"I go to Salad and Go every chance I get! My family lives in Gilbert, so I stop by here first. I like it because it's the only fast food that's healthy! They also let me drop of flyers for roller derby :)  I get the Caprese salad with Gardien. The Black Cherry Boylan's soda is fantastic! Also, they have a ton of options for iced coffee--soy milk, almond milk, low-fat milk, hazelnut, vanilla, caramel...  Only one request...please, please, please open a location in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Super fast and super friendly. Love a lot of the salads there. This location is my favorite because of how terrific the staff is. I know it's just a drive through, but I felt like the young lady who helped me today made an effort to be extra friendly. She was terrific."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here on wednesday morning. I came as soon as they opened. I ordered the Greek salad with shrimp. The salad was amazing and fresh. I love that they chop all of the ingredients into small bite-size pieces and they toss the dressing so that it generously coats every bite. You need to know that they make every salad to order, so the wait times on your order are because they're making it fresh for you. I tried to come here last week during lunch but the window and drive-through lines where way too busy. I recommend trying this place for the first time when it's not the lunch or dinner rush as I'm sure you will have an overall better experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stop in here at least once or twice a week. By far the best drive up/drive through restaurant on the planet. Always friendly staff, and even more importantly, they consistently get out order right (no cheese, add chicken etc). Nothing is worse than bringing home your to go order and finding it all screwed up. This is never the case when you pick up food there. Very pleased with this place. Cannot day enough good things about it!"}
{"text":"Love the idea and the food was just the right portions for me personally. Everything tastes and looks fresh and I liked the idea of having a little drive thru. Customer service was great as well. The soups also really hit the spot. Will be coming back to try more dishes"}
{"text":"Pretty sure Good salad. They don't have Italian dressing, which sucks. Also, they need misters for walk up crowd."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly quick, easy menu, and good for you food.  I love that they have seasonal options.  A good selection and tasty.  Great option for fast quick food."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great healthy options. This is my second time trying this place and it's even better the second time. It's more of a grab and go type of place but there are a few tables outside if you want to eat there. I got the roasted sweet potato and strawberry salad, and the banana kale smoothie. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I can grab a salad on my way to work to save time. Everything is delicious but my favorite is the BBQ salad with chicken."}
{"text":"Great concept for the \"on the go, no time to cook\", person like me.I have always liked the convenience of fast food and now there is a healthy, delicious option with Salad and Go. I live in Central Phoenix and make it a point that anytime I'm in the Gilbert/Chandler area to stop by and grab lunch, or a salad to save for dinner. My three favorites: Spinach and Smoked Bacon, The Santa Fe, and The Asian. The portions are great for the price, huge bowls of mixed greens, tossed in handcrafted dressings, with fresh, delicious proteins available, my favorite salad topper- the grilled flank steak, Yum! Although the drive thru line is long, give it a shot, its worth it. And if you don't want to wait in the drive thru than park, and walk up to the window. Be patient, this food isn't sitting premade and ready to go, it's fresh and made to order. Good things come to those who wait, I can't wait for the restaurant to expand. Kudos to you guys at Salad and Go, for giving us a healthy option to the run of the mill, greasy burger joints that we are all guilty of stopping by for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  You get super fresh, quick, healthy food and from a drive thru!!  It's every moms dream :)"}
{"text":"Great well executed concept! Cobb salad with chicken was as good as any upscale sit down restaurant. Green tea was good too.   Fast and inexpensive.   You can get cheapish processed carbs on every outer corner and it's slowly killing us. We need more places like this!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend trying this place.   Cheap and healthy salads.   I buy two so I have lunch the following day.  My husband even loves them!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for delicious salads. The staff is amazing too!! Have tried about 4 different salads and have yet to not love one of them. Had the Asian salad with chicken today and look forward to getting it again soon."}
{"text":"I've tried every salad, lemonade and smoothie! This place is my go to place for something healthy, fast, and delicious! My favorite salad so far was the seasonal blueberry and the cucumber mint lemonade is perfection! My favorite smoothies the chefs smoothie right now which is the tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"Great place with good selection of salads and beverages. Went for lunch and picked up a cobb salad and it was great big portion for a salad, and decided that I would add shrimp. What I liked is that it was a drive through and the salad was made quick and it tasted great. Would highly recommend. I also had fresh squeezed lemon with mint. That was also very delicious. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I love everything about this healthy lunch spot. It's convenient and so super fast. I have never waited longer than 5 minutes in line, which is nice with two kids in the car. There ingredients are always fresh and I trust the food I'm eating is top quality.   I especially love the southwest salad and the Asian salad. The Serrano like dressing is absolutely delicious! My 4 year old always gets a smoothie and polishes off the entire thing before we even get home. Just recently got breakfast here and the quinoa bowl and yogurt parfait were top notch. Never disappoints, and flavors are always consistent."}
{"text":"We stopped in before a long drive for a quick meal. The service is friendly and fast, the food isn't bad. Overall I would stop again for a quick salad, but won't be coming often or if I have more time for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Finally!  For years I have wondered why there weren't Drive-thru salad & sub restaurants in this area. After visiting friends in Gilbert, AZ I happened to see Salad and Go, well, I had to try them out.  Got their Fall salad with sweet potato, apples, walnuts, feta cheese and beets.  HUGE salad for $7.29, fresh yummy goodness!  The very friendly server told me they were opening one at Broadway & Power, which is closer to my home. Can't wait!  Now all we need is a drive-thru healthy sub shop."}
{"text":"I LOVE salad and go! I'm here about 3 to four times a week. I go to numerous locations and they are consistent at every location. Always greeted with a smile. Always knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions. After having an awful experience tonight at another restaurant I decided to go to my usual spot and of course they never disappoint. I always get the southwestern salad I add tofu. They have a great firm tofu which I love. They have great smoothies and breakfast options also. Although I have never had their breakfast I would not think that they would disappoint knowing how great everything else is. I highly recommend you give them a shot. Anyone I have ever referred to eat here has really been pleased and became regulars just like myself. I left a tip for the girl today and after she shut the window I heard her say oh my God I can't believe she gave me a tip what a nice lady. Sadly people must not leave tips often as they should but I was glad to hear how pleased she was to receive it. She thinks me numerous times. But I think her for her amazing service and the fact that my meal was exactly what I asked for."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a drive thru salad place!? It is amazing here! I love the sitting area outside which is cozy and great in the spring/ winter. They offer vegetarian dishes and gardein chicken!! A vegetarians dream! They are always super friendly and fast and never been disappointed in anything I've tried. Check it out, you won't be either!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now since they've opened and have always been impressed.   Be aware that if you try to come for lunch during the week, the word is out on this place and expect a line of cars wrapped around the building.   My beautiful wife is obsessed with their Cucumber Mint Lemonade paired with just about any of their fresh favorite salads. My item of choice has been the Chicken Caesar Wrap. Chicken is full of flavor, and the Caesar dressing has a nice little garlic kick to it.   Staff is always greeting folks with a friendly hello and making sure no one leaves with any questions on the menu. I'll definitely keep swinging by at least once a week for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"Salad was good not great but for a drive-thru place it was really good and worth the $7.50 for the Santa Fe salad with chicken never had a spicy Santa Fe salad before neat little twist on a classic would definitely come back again if I was in the area"}
{"text":"Salad and go is typically great. The one star is for charging for the steak protein I wanted yet neglecting to add it to our meal. There was no other person outside nor in the drive through. Get your stuff together and in order."}
{"text":"Awesome smoothies and salad. Ordered the southwest Caesar salad with chicken and it was amazing and fresh. Also highly recommend their strawberry and spinach smoothie! I work close by and absolutely love that I can go to a drive thru for a quick healthy meal since I don't have much time for lunch. Super happy nee customer and will be a regular here."}
{"text":"I come to this Salad and Go all the time. Healthy food with a drive thru. Cobb salad with chicken dressing tossed in and a large iced coffee from Bergies beans. Yes please."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's kinda pricey but then again most healthy food is. I love the chicken ceaser wrap. They also have organic coffee. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their menu option. If you aren't into healthy food I still recommend going here because they make it tasty and interesting. It helps get a good foot into clean eating."}
{"text":"Wanted something quick and healthy and we had seen this place a few times so gave it a try.   I got the Cobb with steak. Lots of chunky bleu cheese, bacon, and eggs made it delicious! The lettuce was crispy and the dressing was perfect. So tasty!!!  Daughters got the Greek with chicken and a kids meal. Both excellent.   The location on Yelp seems to be wrong though. It's on Williams Field and Higley, not WF and Power."}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch.  They are a little slow in the drive-thru, but I would rather eat here and something healthy rather than going through a fast food chain.  The price that you pay for a salad and the amount that you get is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place several months ago, but didn't realize they had a second location until I accidentally drove by it after taking a wrong turn. I decided to cease the moment and grab dinner. I did not tell them I was vegan at first and when I ordered the asian salad with no cheese and gardien chicken, they were quick to tell me the dressing had fish sauce in it. They really pay attention to detail and I was very impressed. I ended up getting the Santa Fe salad (dressing still has honey, just FYI) with no cheese and it was delicious! I also noticed on their website that a new location is under construction just down the road from me at Higley & Williams Field. I can't wait to have a close and convenient place to grab a quick breakfast on my way to work in the mornings! \"Fast food\" vegan breakfast options just don't exist so this will be a luxury for me :)"}
{"text":"First try here and just got a Cobb with no protein (I was starving and had already hit in n out for a double double and was looking for something better than fries to go with it).  Great choice. Big salad. Nice mix. Generous portions of everything. If I hadn't gotten the burger it would have been  enough. With the burger it was way more than needed but delicious. I'm kind of a picky salad guy as I'm not a salad lover. Giving it this 4 star rating based on one attempt. Will update after next visit."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Best place to eat healthy without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Quality, healthy food, smoothies, killer lemonade. The people are always nice and friendly.  You don't have to leave your car when it's 117 out.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I am in and out within minutes. The salads taste great. I love getting the seasonal ones. Just be careful if you order tofu with meat in the salad they will ask you like 5 times if you are sure."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!! The food is super fresh and the staff is so friendly! The food came out quicker than McDonald's and it's way healthier!!! We will be back at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a salad with dressing on the side. Instead dressing was smothered in there. Went to call to complain but there listed phone goes to an automated system"}
{"text":"Salad and Go is a great refreshing choice for these steamy summers.  Fresh greens and a variety of add ins.  Love it and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I gave it a try. LETS JUST SAY I'm not a salad guy and it wasn't to bad. The lemonade was outstanding. The service was good and fast. I'll give it a 4 for sure! :)"}
{"text":"My friend has raved about this place for a year. I finally went tonight. $8 for a small salad with no dressing. None on it, none in the bag. Menu said it came with dressing and no one asked me about it. By the time I realized it was left off, they were closed. Terrible, dry, overpriced. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"I live in The Islands and am super glad this place is finally here!  I usually get the Cobb salad and add chicken...salads are huge and always have tons of chicken in them.  The only downside was getting the dressing on the side and getting this small container of dressing that doesn't cover much.  The salad is big enough for two meals and the side of dressing barely covers half of the salad.  Still love the place though!  :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Just moved into the neighborhood and was concerned about the lack of healthy, fast options. This placed saved the day! Affordable, too! I got the sweet potato & strawberry salad and it surpassed my expectations. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place just opened and I have been so anxious to try it. I had the roasted vegetable salad win basil dressing. Absolutely wonderful and refreshing! The lettuce tasted like it had just been picked from the garden. Service was fast and friendly as well! Would love to see a few more vegan options on the breakfast menu but it seems to be that you can customize most things.  Excited to try some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST fast food there is. I hope it only grows into the size of McDonald's where you see one on every few corners!!! Some of us are busy and have not Learned the art of meal prep for lunch (aka myself) and are very busy throughout our days! Salad and go KEEPS ME GOING!! With healthy food that sustains me I can enjoy the rest of my work day. I love the whole concept behind salad and go, and I love the food that stands with it. Thank you for the owner who believed she could do something like this!!- sincerely one happy customer"}
{"text":"Eaten here for over three months, several times a week.  The consistency is very high but I do notice differences in my 7pm salad to the usual 1pm one.   E.G., the number of grape tomatoes seems to be highly random at night,  my wife has noted more inconsistencies in their greek with the number of olives at these times too.   Prices are great, I first came here as I was trying to remove a lot of crap from my diet but not morning burritos and  here I was right next to my work  a location that gave me a great one, fresh ingredients and fast service at the same price and 1/2 the calories and about 1/3 of the sodium that my old mate Jack tossed out.  After a while, I was curious enough to try out the salads and found that holy heck I could live on them.     Just over $6 for a cobb salad, it's good enough I don't get the additional proteins.  That's my biggest problem with  SnG, the proteins aren't that good, just bland, not enough for the money, I can do better for less,  when it comes to the salad it's a great deal.  Staff appear to be as happy as your average Dutch Brothers ( very)  but there's no time to chat that building is one hell of a salad shooter and most of the time between the order and moving 2-3 car lengths down it's time to go!    Great nutrition labelling, knowledgeable about their menu and the head office replied quickly to a question I had on ingredients.      It's 4.5   rounded up."}
{"text":"Wonderful find! Love the drive through idea also, so convenient. The BBQ chicken wrap was wonderful , fresh and filling. This will be our new go to place for lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"If you forget breakfast, go here and try their breakfast bowl!!! It is AMAZING. Grab a salad for lunch, while you are there, too! And you must try their cucumber lemonade. Yum."}
{"text":"Unimpressed to say the leaat.... my wrap seriously looked like it was wrapped by a monkey.  Taste was okay but all the lettuce was on one end while the topping were at the other. I know it's cheap food, but come on! I make wraps at my work all day and none of mine ever look like that. Plus, it was pretty small. Barely bigger than my fist. I heard the portions here were supposed to be pretty decent, but I would say there just okay. Will probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a nice variety of different types of salads and the contents always seem very fresh. I have been to two locations. It is also super convenient with the drive through. Most of the time it's quicker than going through the McDonald's line!"}
{"text":"Best salads I've ever had! I have tried everything on the menu and not only are the salads healthy and good for you, they are absolutely delicious! I'm so happy they opened a second location that is near my house. I love that almost all their salads are also a gluten free option. Their beverages are delicious, including the sodas, smoothies, shakes and coffee. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a healthier fast food option who wants the best salad they've ever had. The staff is also amazing and very friendly. If you haven't tried Salad and Go, you must try it!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best, healthier fast food option ever! Every salad is huge and tastes amazing! You can add chicken, steak, shrimp or gardein chicken to any salad for a small extra price that is completely worth it. Every salad can be tweeked to make it exactly how you like it. You can add ingredients, take out ingredients or even just build your own salad. I love that almost all the salads are gluten free and love that they use organic ingredients. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for a healthy fast food option. It's a must try if you haven't tried it. The employees are super nice and always have a smile on their faces. You'll be in a better mood just by showing up to Salad and Go, and then even happier once you start eating. A must go!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! On Tuesday I ordered three wraps with the dressing on the sides. When I left I realized they had only put two wraps in the bag with no sides of dressing. I want back and the assistant manager replaced the whole order and let us keep the two wraps already made. I said they didn't need to do that but she said it was their mistake and insisted. This is the best customer service I have seen in a very very long time. There food is healthy and their service is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Salads are fresh, reasonably priced and you can make them into wraps! Everything is always yummy, just wish they had indoor seating!"}
{"text":"Kewl concept and probably a much needed option too. I originally thought this place may have been affiliated with a salad restaurant in Tucson but it's not.  It is a Gilbert based business.   Perfect. I got the Strawberry and Roasted Almond Salad with the additional grilled free range chicken.  My son got a Spinach & Smoked Bacon wrap with the added chicken.  His disappeared before i could snap a picture.  Mine is a good size salad bowl with a good portion of chicken.  Disappointed that it had so few strawberries in it cuz it's like a buck fifty more than the other salads without any extras.  Also one bite tasted soapy.  WTH did that come from????  Also came across a couple hair like fibers in my salad like short animal hair or something.   Maybe bristle from a produce scrubbing brush?    Natural afternoon daylight really helps improve my vision bit that's not always a good thing.  :-p.  We'll try this place again I suppose."}
{"text":"Great salads, fast service and super friendly staff. I'm going to deduct but not visually deduct 1/2 star for the traditional breakfast bowls (tried about 5 now) so I've tried to remain open but the traditional breakfast bowls, the ones I've had, have just been okay. They could use a bit more seasoning, the bacon pieces are fatty (they're like undercooked bacon bits), and the potatoes are plain. Good salsa though .. I really do like this place; the salads are HUGE, fresh and there are a ton of options especially when you utilize the BYO. I'm hopeful more locations will start opening soon but fortunately this one on Bethany is in my work area. Banana kale smoothie is a must try too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing from I have just seen. Today was my first time here I got the Chicken Artichoke soup .. omg fantastic and Greek salad very good . Prices are incredible and I will go back . Thank you for the kind drive thu service I'm glad we finally have a healthy drive though ."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a long time. I was in the area and decided to stop in. The serving size is great for the price. The veggies were fresh and I liked the dressing as well. If I'm in the area around lunch time I will def be back."}
{"text":"Awsome salads smoothies and wrap. Power wrap was Amazing! An outstanding Chef Daniel!!"}
{"text":"Should I concerned every time I get the broccoli chicken soup it tastes and looks different?"}
{"text":"I love Salad & Go, for breakfast and lunch/dinner! In the morning, I love to swing in and snag a warm berry quinoa bowl (quinoa, strawberries, blueberries, almonds, coconut and peanut butter) and an iced chai.   For lunch/dinner, their salads are amazing, you can't go wrong with any of them.  I love that the nutritional content is on the menu, so you know what you're eating, rather than guessing.  My only complaint is the consistency of the food. Sometimes the portions are very generous, other times, they are pretty small."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place and the service is very friendly. The food was amazing we ate breakfast and I had the burrito with a green tea. The cost is not expensive. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I have never had Salad N Go then they opened this one right next to my house! So I went to check it out and it was wonderful. All the employees are very friendly and the food is so fresh! Also the building is really good looking! Very well kept and put together makes you really feel good about going to this place! Will for sure return and definitely recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering first bite! I like salad but the salad I had today was just wow! I will be back soon, add chicken for $1.50..... Can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Surprise. Healthy options, great varied menu and fresh ingredients. Great house lemonade. Just in time for summer. I never have to cook again."}
{"text":"Fantasic!! Need a location in Tempe ASAP!"}
{"text":"This location just opened recently.  The service was excellent, friendly, and very quick.  The grounds and exterior were very clean.  The outside tables were clean.  This location has a drive-thru and walk-up window.  Overall great experience!  We ordered the Kale and Banana and the Breakfast Smoothies with added protein.  Excellent."}
{"text":"The strawberry and spinach smoothie is delicious. It  honestly doesn't taste like it would be healthy but it is! Definitely get the protein if you drink it in the morning you'll be full till after lunch time. The salads are delicious. The people are friendly. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"My new favorite! Greek salad was super delicious and the dressing was amazing. Prices are great. If you go through drive thru it's super fast!!"}
{"text":"Had the Cobb without cheese and balsamic vinaigrette, it was perfect ! Taste so fresh and was actually bigger than I thought it would be ! Prices are amazing"}
{"text":"When this location first opened it was great. Now their staff seems very distracted and under-trained. I went in for a salad and 2 coffees. The girl working kept rushing me and giving me the total when I wasn't finished. When I received my coworkers coffee it didn't have any milk in it even though we talked about what kind of milk was available. When I asked why there wasn't milk in it she gave me a weird look and said you didn't want any. I also ordered a pasta salad that comes with balsamic vinaigrette. I asked for dairy free milk in my own coffee and no dairy on my salad. They gave me a different salad dressing that contained dairy. I also didn't receive any straws in my bag and wasn't offered a drink carrier for my multiple beverages. The whole time I was there the employees inside were standing around loudly talking and laughing and one of them made a snarky comment about me wanting no cheese. I'm disappointed that this location has lost its excellent customer service it used to have and hope they can get they're act together."}
{"text":"Salad and go is wonderful for a quick, healthy bite! They have extremely quick service with very generous prices. I have been there a few times and have yet to be disappointed. Their lemonade is fantastic, their salads are flavorful, and the convenience of them being to-go is a beautiful thing! This is a great place for a lunch break or just a quick bite in general."}
{"text":"Had mixed greens and apple salad with chicken....YUM... Fast, fresh and very tasty. Price is very reasonable. Helpful and friendly staff for first timers"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but goodness for Salad and Go! I am in love with their Roasted Sweet Potato salad. Any salad comes in a wrap. They're quick, healthy, and give you a ton of food. They have tons of salad choices and it's always fresh.   The Cucumber Mint Lemonade is to die for as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place on earth. You can't go wrong with an organic salad that has anything you could ever want on it for 5.74. Count me in. I wish this was available in Colorado too. Heart eyes times one million."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place...salads, sandwiches, smoothies, burritos are all awesome. Even compared to restaurant salads the quality here is great and prices are under $6 or $7 for the most part.   Staff is super friendly! On par with Dutch Bros with the high service level but less annoying than those guys"}
{"text":"Not so happy with the quality of the lettuce, you would think that a salad place that only does salads would look at the freshness of there product. I hear good things about this place and I see they have great reviews, maybe it was just an off day but spent almost $30 and wasn't impressed. Freshness in key salad to go"}
{"text":"We walked up to the patio window, ordered and dined on the patio today.  Several cars ordered via the drive thru while we dined outside. It was late afternoon.  * She had the Greek Salad and water to drink.  * I had the Apple Salad with candied pecans, golden raisins, blue cheese and more.. mine was paired with a vinaigrette dressing.    * It was breezy and cool from our wintery day so I added a cup of their \"Chicken and Wild Rice\" soup.    * I recalled something about their lemonade, and selected the one with cucumber and mint.  Outcome:  For myself.. All DELICIOUSLY FRESH and (as consistently reported by others) the portions were great - very filling and satisfying. I enjoyed the soup and lemonade equally.  She reported enjoying her Greek Salad very much.   No regrets.  Notes:   There was even an intriguing \"kids menu\" that wasn't based on chicken tenders like so many other places; I was almost taken in myself by their \"pin wheels\".  Service was great; today there were two (2) pleasant and efficient folks taking our order and filling it that we met.  I'm not normally one to order a salad as my meal, but this was fantastic.  Heads up (plan accordingly): no bathroom access for customers.  Bottom line:  Yes - I would re-order this again as-is in an instant, but I already found five (5) salads I wanted to try and will be back for each of them shortly."}
{"text":"Love having a healthy fast food alternative for days when I'm not in the mood to cook dinner. Everything is tasty and their smoothies are the bomb!"}
{"text":"My wife and I drive by the place every now and then.  I almost always point it out and say we should try it out.  So today I suggest we stop by for lunch on a nice Saturday afternoon.  I ordered the Southwest Caesar with chicken.  She got the BBQ Caesar with steak.  We were both impressed with the portion sizes as compared to the prices.  Both had good flavor and appropriate amounts of dressing mixed in.  We will definitely be back again to try some new salads.  Especially now that my wife said, \"Why didn't you tell me about this place... it was awesome!!\"  :)   And a far better value than places like Panera!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is close to home,  I go often, the salads are so fresh,  the drive thru is quick and they are so nice. The gluten free menu is tasty. I highly recommend anybody to try this place if you haven't already.  Your missing out on the some of the best fresh healthy food if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is always fresh, as it should be, and their cucumber mint lemonade is amazing!! Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing salads! Some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it. I would love if they opened earlier, around 6, for breakfast. I would stop by every day on my way to work!"}
{"text":"I purchased the chia seed yogurt without the Greek yogurt, and it was pretty tasty! I've tried a salad and the breakfast wrap as well. Great portions, and easy to order vegan as they have tofu and they'll take the dairy out, as almost everything is made as it is ordered. I'm very grateful to have this location so close to home."}
{"text":"I love salad and go!! I always get their green smoothies which make me feel like I'm getting the vegetables I need when I'm having a cheat day. Their chai tea and sandwiches are good too."}
{"text":"I've been asking myself all day why I waited so long to try this place. This morning I wasn't feeling the greatest and was really craving something healthy and filling. I remembered that they served breakfast so I stopped by and was pleasantly surprised. I narrowed it down to either the breakfast bowl or the warm Quinoa Bowl. I decided the Warm Quinoa Bowl was exactly what I wanted. The service was great and I had my bowl in under three minutes. It was almost too beautiful to eat, but believe me I managed to eat every last night. The fruit was fresh, yummy peanut butter, and perfect mix of nuts and coconut as well. It even held me o we until lunch. I can't wait to come again for lunch and try a salad."}
{"text":"Very tasty salads, excellent service!  I love that lettuce is hand-leafed and the customer is able to make changes to meet your tastes. A wonderful addition to Surprise!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than healthy fast food! Inexpensive, yummy, super fast. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place they amount was very little compared to today this salad was 7.86 definitely worth the amount they gave me this time around I love this salad ! Very fresh ingredients !"}
{"text":"I've been to the Gilbert and Mesa locations and I'm SO happy they just opened this location! They have so many different salad options and if you are like me and hate salads you can make it into a wrap and add a choice of protein! Sometimes I even order off the kids menu, a wrap fruit and chocolate milk. They have a sign that says the romaine lettuce is not sourced from Yuma, which is a plus. Not to mention the service is super fast!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of Salad N Go...   If they maintain all of their same standards as the original Gilbert location, at all of the expansion locations, their growth will be Epic!!  The Caesar Salad with \"Double order of add on Prawns\" is amazing. Lightly tossed with Dressing."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up fast healthy food.  Much more than salads.  Each and every employee I've dealt with at the Pinnacle Peak location has been pleasant. I had one issue, brought it to their attention, and they exceeded my expectations in resolving it.  I will definitely continue to visit this business."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! For the salad, you do have option to have it wrapped. It's similar how sonic setup since there's no eat in dine. Three tables outside. Hence the name of the place where it says \"and go\". Ideal for someone in hurry and still get great healthy food. One of the workers knows sign language that makes our experience with communication much easier."}
{"text":"I ordered two salads. Got home and realized they were just a little wrong(added grilled onions and I didn't order that).  I went back and they remade both salads! The cashier offered me a few smoothie, etc. ( I chose not to take anything except my salads) I wrote the company to tell them how amazing their employee is and how she went above and beyond and they gave me a free salad.  I love salad and go! The poblano ceaser is the best dressing!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for about a year now. I absolutely love this place. For an extremely large portions salad they have very reasonable pricing. Staff is always extremely helpful and friendly and receive generous tips from me everytime I go through. I would highly recommend the mixed greens and apple salad!!!"}
{"text":"chicken in the greek wrap was dry, service was quick, no sweet treats \"the owner said sweets are not healthy\" replied the gal at the window.  Uh, who cares?  Look, I do my best to make healthy choices thats why I sought out this place anyway.  I felt a little guilty about even asking.  I don't need a gigantic piece of cake everyday but a little something sweet with my meals is a staple in my diet.   Another salad place I frequent has a little caramel you can purchase with a meal, tiny little caramel, not a big dent in my diet plan."}
{"text":"I am from Texas .The salad wrap was very good and the smoothie was great .great choice if you want to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Nice to have a healthy fast food option in the neighborhood.  Limited menu options.  My greek salad wrap had so much black pepper that it burned my mouth.  And the wrap is so small that the food breaks through and falls out.  However, I will try it again until I find something I like."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place right now. First of all, love the drive-thru. All the employees here are super friendly (shout out to Charles in the drive-thru window) and everyone is as accommodating as possible about allergies/etc. Their menu is descriptive and even lists calories for every entree!  To make it even better, the food is great!! I love the Caesar wrap on white (with chicken), and the Santa Fe salad (no protein). The chia seed pudding is also amazing, just sweet enough! I've had their smoothies which I am also a fan of, but be aware that I don't think they use added sweetener, so it's not like \"Jamba Juice sweet\" (which honestly I prefer). Their cucumber mint lemonade is PHENOMENAL. I want to drink it literally every day.  Everything here tastes fresh, light, and isn't too expensive. I am so glad I work close to here and will definitely be back many many times."}
{"text":"So good, cheap, healthy and fast  If they had one of these in southern California where I live, I would be a very regular customer  The great cheap tea is the icing on the cake"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS IS MOST LIKE IT! First time going, i ordered 2 rolled tacos for breakfast. Service was so fast, that's because they forgot to warm up the tacos. My tacos were icy COLD! I have no idea how the girl who bagged them didn't feel how cold they were.  Unfortunately I was on my way to work and realized it until I was getting out of my car. I tried calling them to let them know my food was practically frozen, and they have NO contact number on the receipt. I had to google the number, I tried giving them a call, but guess what? You can't talk to anyone! All you get a recorded message with there location and restaurant hours. No option to talk to anyone."}
{"text":"I heard all the hype but I was less than impressed. I like the concept but for me it misses the mark"}
{"text":"I go to this place at least twice a week. My favorite salad is the green apple. I also get the Cobb pretty often. Today I ordered one of their seasonal salads with brussel sprouts and it was delicious. I love that there is an option to add chicken, steak or salmon to your salads. I have always added chicken but after seeing the pics of the salads with steak, I may try that soon as well. The service is fast. If the drive thru looks busy, don't be fooled, you probably won't even wait longer than 10minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Almost wish it had a dine in option too! Salads are amazing and great size! Perfect value for money!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised and pleased by what I found here! I have been meaning to stop by for some time now. I recommend this place all the time to my nutrition coaching clients as a great alternative fast food option just based off of their menu. The service was so great and personal for a drive through and the food was AWESOME! I can't even tell you how much I loved the seasonal gazpacho. I had so much flavor and was the perfect way to cool down from the Arizona summer heat. The portion size for the salads was huge! It was on par with what you would get at a nice sit down restaurant and was fresh and crisp. It's really such a great value.  I also think it's important to make a note of how great the kids meal worked out. Normally I'm not proud when I resort to fast food for my children. What we got here was healthy, affordable, and kid approved. All around this was a great experience and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new and so much more than salad.  I was so surprised by how amazing the wrap was that I can't wait to go back.    It was delicious, and more importantly affordable. The service was great and the staff was very friendly.    Definitely give this place a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best fast food salad place around and the salads are absolutely delicious and totally customizable to what you want added or omitted. Price is great and food is really good."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"roasted beet and quinoa salad\" (literally what I said!!) only to be given the antipasto salad. I don't really like olives in general so this salad wasn't great, but I did like the cheese they used.  The chia parfait my boyfriend got was delicious but overpriced. I might come back to order the original salad I wanted and hopefully give a better rating!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very limited salad bar and this is what she is confused as to not come this way comparable to sue plantation please"}
{"text":"Fast, Friendly and Fresh.  Unbelievably impressed. From the fresh chopped lettuce (yes, you can tell) and flavorful dressings to the very reasonable prices, I'll now be hitting this place up at least 2 times a week for lunch.  Thank you Salad & Go!! Come to North Phoenix next!"}
{"text":"The salad was great!!!! The not ripe avocado that was hard as a rock ruined the salad experience........,"}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about the salad choices here. My salad was okay, nothing special. I didn't really care for their balsamic dressing. I did really enjoy the green smoothie though."}
{"text":"This place makes it really easy to try to eat clean. I love to get the chia seed parfait for breakfast. It reminds me of \"Sua Fa'i\" a samoan banana pudding. The cobb salad is my favorite and they load it with tons of yummy bacon. If you are short on time and wanna maintain some clean eating...stop by this place.  \"Trust your fat homies, we are big for a reason.\""}
{"text":"Delicious, quick and fresh.  I like that they show you the nutritional value for everything you order.  Will definitely be a return guest."}
{"text":"*Drumroll*  The top ten reasons to go to Salad and Go:  10. A good variety of salads to choose from 9. Reasonably priced. Almost all salads are by default vegetarian but you can add different proteins (Chicken, shrimp, tofu, steak) for a little bit more 8. There is a walk up counter and a drive through here for quick ordering 7. They are FAST! Fast food salad! 6. They also offer breakfast, wraps, soups and a kid's menu 5. They have seasonal menu items too. Their summer special peach mango ginger lemonade I had recently was very refreshing! 4. The portions are generous and a whole salad makes for a very filling meal 3. The menu is easy to browse through with calorie counts for each item 2. It's a healthier alternative to other fast food drive throughs!  1. Salads are brilliant. Take it from Thom Yorke:  \"Well actually I'm not a man but a carrot. The band was eating salads one day and a carrot fell off of the salad bar onto a microphone and the band realized that they had just discovered something brilliant. Me.\""}
{"text":"I love the concept. Fast food doesn't have to be unhealthy! Drive up, order a salad, and get it in record time.   I had the roasted sweet potato and strawberry salad. It came with a champagne vinaigrette. Overall it was decent. The flavors skewed more towards the acidic side and I would have liked a little more sweetness to balance out the taste of the dressing. There were plenty of sweet potatoes, strawberries, and goat cheese crumbles to eat with the salad. It was a good deal for the amount of salad you get, a little under $6. Note that you can add a protein to the salad for a few dollars extra.  Service was cheerful and friendly. If you're in the area and want something refreshing on the go, you can't go wrong with Salad and Go!"}
{"text":"Drive through salad is always a good idea to me! This Salad and Go provided quick and friendly service. There was already a line of cars when I got here but the line moved swiftly and I was ready to head back in just a few minutes.   I had the monthly special salad, the Sonoran. It was a lovely looking bowl of veggies of different colors and textures. I enjoyed all the variety in it. It had ingredients such as pepitas, corn, kale, romaine, carrots, and Poblano peppers. It came with a Serrano honey lime vinaigrette which was a little sweeter than what I was expecting, but went well with the salad. It had a hint of lime and a small tinge of spiciness from the Serrano chiles.  The total was a little less than $8 with tax. Not bad for all that salad! If you're looking for a fast fresh salad for your meal this is your place."}
{"text":"Drive thru salads made to order... what's not to like?! I've only been here once, but I can't wait to try more combinations. The salads are $7+ but they are huge and I could easily get two meals out of one. They also have some unique drink options (blueberry rosemary lemonade), sandwiches, wraps, and smoothies. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fast Food can't be any more healthy and great tasting than Salad and Go. I live in Tempe AZ and will travel to Gilbert to get a couple of salads to go and bowel of their chicken corn chowder. Most excellent experience when we want to eat in but not cook. I think the Chicken Corn Chowder is a must try. They have other sites in the valley now and building more so look them and stay away from McDonald's."}
{"text":"I would think a salad restaurant would have thousand island or honey mustard dressing, but they have neither.  Rather odd."}
{"text":"The sweet potato & quinoa salad is delicious!! I love to come here when I don't feel like cooking, one salad is big enough for 2 meals! The service is always fast and friendly :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch for the first time. I was very pleased with the fast friendly service, from order to receiving my salad was about 5min. I got the southwest Caesar with chicken, the ingredients were fresh and tasty definitely will be back. Portions were a good value for my money."}
{"text":"salad was tasty other than the fact that the chicken that I paid extra for wasn't added unfortunately. so that was frustrating but I called after and the lady was nice and offered a complimentary salad my next visit."}
{"text":"I am so happy Chandler Blvd has a S&G. I was driving all the way out to Cooper to order the Greek Salad when I wanted to eat a salad. I can't believe it's taken so long for me to review because I come here once a day. I'm not a fan of the cold brew otherwise this place would be a 5 star. The prices are unbelievable and I'm happy to hear they are lowering the seasonal salads to match with the regular prices. My only peeve is the nutrition facts on the salads. The carbs are outrageous with some being 55g carbs+. Ouch. Overall my favorite is the Cobb."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Just happy that there is finally a healthy place for fast food.  I had the caprese salad and it was great!  Overall this is a place to try- easy, healthy, tastes good, and affordable prices!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! The family and I are always looking for convenience with a healthy and this place is exactly that. The salad and the wraps are delicious, and the best part is you can add steak, shrimp, chicken, or tofu to any salad or wrap. I know what your thinking, \"shrimp at a drive through? Yeah right!\" Just try it. Food is high quality and the service is good every time. Try the pumpkin chai smoothie if your feeling extra healthy, it's great!"}
{"text":"If you're on the go and only have time for drive threw meal and still want to eat healthy then this is the place to go! The salads are made fresh to order and are delicious! So fare my favorites are \"Greek\" and \"Roasted sweet potato and strawberry\" yum!"}
{"text":"I literally eat a salad almost every day here. So fast, fresh and delicious, not to mention affordable. I drive through, on my way to work, every couple of days. I buy one salad for that day and one for the next. They stay super fresh up to three days. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Simple and easy menu to read and distinguish vegetarian and gluten free options. Fresh and healthy ingredients. Loved the mixed green and apple salad! Abby was immensely helpful (today was my first time eating here) and super friendly! Wish this location was closer to my house!!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a try today for lunch and was very happy with it.  I ordered the Asian salad but as a wrap with the honey wheat tortilla.  It was packed full of the Asian salad and was delicious.  I really liked the dressing, which I chose to have tossed in the with salad prior to being rolled up in the tortilla instead of having the dressing on the side.  I also ordered an Arnold Palmer and that was pretty good as well.  Definitely a place to go back to again sometime."}
{"text":"Can't wait to move to Arizona and eat here regularly. While visiting family on vacation we ate here several times and enjoyed several Salads, all were delicious. Love the fact that you can add your choice of protein as well."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would like this place. But to my surprise it is now becoming one of my \"GO-TO\" places. The salad is FRESH as it can be. Even good enough to eat the next day! I had some leftovers and thought it would be bad, but I ate it for lunch the following day and still great!  My first time I ordered the Sweet Potato & Strawberry salad with chicken and had the lemonade. It is top notch! I was impressed. I'm excited to try more things on the menu at my next visit."}
{"text":"This place just opened up by my house. I'm not gonna lie, the idea of a fast and convenient place to get healthy food really interested me. Well, I wasn't disappointed!  I ended up getting the Santa Fe salad with steak and it was awesome! The dressing that comes with it really adds a lot of flavor and all of the ingredients taste really fresh. Another major bonus is that they are fast. I was expecting it to take a while sitting in the drive thru but I had my salad in just a few minutes   I'm definitely a fan and will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"I started my new running exercise routine last night after work. After getting done running, I tried \"Salad 2 Go\" for the first time.  I loved that they had all of their calories right on the menu. I went with the \"Chia Seed Parfait\", which is actually one of their all day breakfast items, but it suited me for dinner. It was outstanding and the customer service was also amazing! While I was waiting for my parfait, I saw a drink that looked like cucumber mint and asked if I could have a small sample. That will be my reasons for going back now it was so refreshing! I love this place and I am going to tell everyone about it!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good, I've been here 3+ times a week since I first tried it. The prices are great and the quality and service are outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered the Organic Tropical Green smoothie ($4) and Roasted Sweet Potato and Strawberry salad ($6) and added chicken. The smoothie has kale and spinach in it, but they do a good job of masking the 'green' taste with other tropical ingredients. The salad is not a knock out of the park, but I would order it again- mixed greens with quinoa, strawberries, roasted sweet potatoes and blue cheese (or feta?) crumbles. The dressing is a tangy vinegarette. It's large in size for the price. Could probably make 2 meals, especially if you also order a smoothie, which to note is about 210 calories. They lose a star for not having indoor seating- although the concept is 2 go, I would like to sit inside ac during the summer. Have both drive thru or walk up option."}
{"text":"First time trying Salad and Go and I wasn't disappointed. I got the Asian Salad with chicken, and it was very delicious. The staff was courteous and friendly. Plus they also have treats for your pups as well!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the Caprese salad! Omg! Sooo good!! I will definitely be back.  This is the best salad and an incredible price. I hope they open more locations. I could eat here every day!!!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Hilton right behind this place, it's hot and I wanted something close by. Glad I picked this place. It's so convenient to the hotel, I hope more guests with patron this place. We stay here whenever in town and I will sure to visit Salad and Go in the future.   Service: the young lady who took my order was super friendly and had a smile on her face the whole time I was there. The food was ready quickly and correctly.   Food: I asked the young lady her favorites and ordered that: bbq ranch with chicken on a honey wheat wrap. I am so glad that I did! It was so good! The ingredients are fresh and the flavors in the wrap are distinctive. I would get this again!  This is not a complaint but a preference: I wish the lettuce and chicken would have been chopped smaller."}
{"text":"5 stars if they would have had more organic choices but I am still happy! Kim helped me through everything on my first visit. Informing me of the seasonal specials, all day breakfast items, organic items available and every other question I had. She was great! Thanks for the drive thru salad and smoothie bar!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little reluctant to try a fast food salad place, but am glad I eventually gave it a try. With this crazy world we live in it's nice to have a choice where you can go to a drive through and actually place an order for something that is good for you. So convenient, and have tried 3 salads so far and enjoyed them all.  Think this a great concept and will be back for many more trips when running late and want to grab something to eat but not at the same ole fast food places. Very nice alternative to the fast food industry!"}
{"text":"Nice little place added to Gilbert. Took me a while to get over here to try it, but glad I did. Menu selection is decent, they are quick, staff is friendly and portions are pretty big. When I am not in the mood for fried, greasy food for lunch, this is definitely my go-to. I hope they keep adding different things to their menu, other than that 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Don't try it. You will be addicted for-EVER :) all jokes aside menu prices are reasonable and everything in the menus is DARN good."}
{"text":"I got the summer salad and a strawberry basil lemonade. The salad was a great portion and great mixture of lettuce and toppings! The best part was how fresh everything was: the crisp lettuce mixture, the juicy strawberries, the soft quinoa, etc.  The lemonade was absolutely delicious!! I love strawberry mint together but the basil really surprised me! Overall, great fast meal option - fairly priced and healthy!!"}
{"text":"Always a good, easy place. It's convenient and delicious. I recommend the sante fe chicken :)"}
{"text":"The owner was diligent enough to notice my review and ask to speak with me in person. Though I haven't had the opportunity to call her I am going to update my rating with an additional star to reflect the excellent service I did receive both at the drive-thru and in response to my review. I still have reservations about the product but promise to give them another try and stick with the classics to be fair."}
{"text":"The Apple-Bacon salad is so fabulous!! Dressing is amazing and I would not change one thing about it! Cheap, delicious and drive through easy!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I only wish there was one closer to my house! Huge, fresh salad and decent prices! Best thing of all, I can get it fast in a drive thru."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!  I used to eat subway and burritos, but one day I decided to stop at  Salad and Go.  The Louie salad I ordered was yummy and it  filled me up!  Now I visit the drive thru all the time.  Where else can you get fast, fresh food without the guilt?  I'm losing weight.  Thanks Salad and Go :)"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have visited on several occasions since the opening of this location. We have never had a bad salad. The knock off of stars is the kids menu. My two beasties love the peanut butter and banana wrap. It's no longer offered as a kids menu choice. The meals also came with a piece of fruit. Not any more. A small wrap and a drink left the kiddos still hungry after we stopped here for lunch."}
{"text":"This was a great stop! So fast, and \"real food\" to boot! It's refreshing to get such a good quality salad at fast food pace and price. Crisp, cold, and a great variety of combinations.Their dressings are outstanding, for sure! Can we get one up & running in MT?!? :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, and my husband and I finally did today. I had the southwest caesar salad with chicken and he had the Asian with chicken and they were both amazing. The dressing that comes with the southwest Caesar was so good! We asked for extra dressing, and they didn't charge extra for it. The portions are huge! For the price and how amazing the food is, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered A Cobb salad, corn chowder, and a lemonade. The salad was very basic for a Cobb salad, but very good indeed. There was a whole entire chunk of avocado in the salad that I had to break up myself. Not a big deal though. Some of the lettuce was a little brown. The soup was not at all what I would have pictured. It looks like split pea soup and slightly tasted like it, but there aren't any peas in there... Hardly any corn in the corn chowder. The lemonade however was AMAZING. I think next time I go, I will try something a little different!"}
{"text":"Tried it with the wifey.     Nice and quick, which was good but did kind of  agree it feels like the fast food of salads.  Although the salad was huge, it was mostly lettuce (which tasted a little less than fresh but not rotten or slimey) the dressing was just ok , and I had to really look for the chicken.     Will most likely try a couple more times if we're in a pinch but if I have the time I would rather a nicer salad for the same price just down the road."}
{"text":"Quickest drive through in Phoenix, was literally in and out in five minutes. Chicken pot pit soup is delish, and the prices are insanely low for what you receive. Super impressed!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant for breakfast and lunch. I eat here a lot because I live nearby and it's on my way to work. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because they often run out of ingredients and/or make a mistake on an order. I cant count the number of times I've ordered something and they responded with oh we are out of potatoes, strawberries, or whatever it is. They usually say they can replace it with something else but I usually opt to purchase a different item. They've made mistakes with my order a few times. Examples would be giving me the wrong size of coffee, giving me hot instead of cold coffee, and forgetting ingredients in salads (no olives in the antipasto salad). If I catch the mistake before I leave, they are always happy to fix it but sometimes you don't know until you start to eat. However, the food is tasty, fast, and healthy so I still enjoy it here. I wish they would keep there ingredients better stocked and make sure they are giving you the correct, complete order before you drive off."}
{"text":"I swear I came up with this idea 20 years ago when I was in high school (way to date myself).   The concept is great. Fast, healthy, affordable and delicious.   It doesn't get much better in a drive through!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of Salad and Go but wish there were more options. I got the Mediterranean pasta salad with shrimp and no olives or red onions. My order was ready as soon as I pulled up to the window (no one was in front of me) which was extremely impressive. Friendly, fast service.   I didn't love my meal though. The pasta was definitely not to my liking and had a strange taste. The raw spinach and broccoli didn't really seem to go with this salad. Perhaps cooked but not raw. I enjoyed the chipotle ranch dressing which I got instead of the vinaigrette.   I also had the cucumber mint lemonade which had an interesting flavor. I'd give it 3.5 stars overall but I'm rounding up to 4 because of the service and concept."}
{"text":"This is for sure one of my favorite places to get a nice quick meal. All of their salads are delicious. And they're really good about customizing if you want to take something off or add. I also love their smoothies, and the seasonal menu items are always fun to add something new to the mix. Their lemonade is my favorite and my husband loves their iced tea. I hope they continue to expand and add to their menu! They also give out treats to my dogs when I have them in the car with me in the drive thru!"}
{"text":"This is the most fantastic thing, and healthy drive through!!! Their salads and large, decently priced and delicious. The ONLY reason I marked down one start is because they removed their 'seasonal' Jalapeño Ranch salad....it was the best salad I'd ever had!!!! Friends and coworkers felt same. Please bring it back permanently!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, I'm not a healthy food water but this place was good.  Went through the drive thru and picked up food for me and my wife.  I had the Southwest wrap with chicken and it was tasty.  My wife enjoyed her salad.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loooove this place!!! The kale smoothie is legit!!! Great customer service and friendly staff!! I also love the Caesar salad!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place. The salad was awful! I opened the container and it smelled like old lettuce. The tomatoes were mush and the kalamatas were diced so small I could barely find them. I won't be back :("}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times this week and I feel no shame. The Cobb salad, the caprese salad, and the seasonal jalapeño ranch salad are legitimately amazing. Try the steak with your salad because its tender, seasoned perfectly, and melt in your mouth good. The portions are just right, the staff is friendly, and thus far I've had no problems. I imagine myself making this establishment a regular part of my week. They're cheap and I, hands down, prefer this place over any other fast food place."}
{"text":"Love this place.   It is a perfect place for mom to get a salad when the rest of the family (kids) want fast food. it is quick and has a lot of selections of salads. it is extra $ to add chicken or other meat. The staff is friendly but over the top."}
{"text":"This place is a great concept and delivers great food. Fresh, fast, yummy salads, and good price point. Will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Who ever knew a drive thru salad shop could be so consistently good.  Fast and friendly, and a great value too.  I'm passing through twice a week."}
{"text":"I seriously want to cry that Tucson does not have one of these places. I was on my way to Flagstaff and needed a quick bite. I was stuck in a giant shopping center with all the generic unhealthy foods like Carl's Jr., Panda Express, pizza joints and coffee shops. Thankfully I remembered Yelp and did a quick search of what was nearby. I saw this place is a sea of 2-3 stars food places. It was seriously an oasis and I thought it was a mirage. Could a healthy food joint exist out in the middle of nowhere? The answer is yes! I backtracked a little ways to this cute, tiny place. It is a drive-thru or outdoor seating (no bathroom). I choose to get out since the drive-thru line was long. I was overwhelmed with all the delicious sounding wraps. I chose to go with the Santa Fe and Gardein \"chicken\". That's fake chicken if you don't know the brand. The wrap also had jicama which is not a common ingredient but it was so crisp, fresh and a perfect addition to the wrap. My first bite was heaven and every bite there after was just as good. The wrap was huge and stuffed to the gills. I also tried the mango iced tea which was strong and not sugary sweet, which I really dislike overly sweet tea. Please come to Tucson!!! If you're up in the Phoenix area or surrounding areas, check them out!"}
{"text":"Tasty, fast, and fresh! I went to salad and go for the first time last night, I didn't want to cook because it was too hot. So I figured fast food would be fine, and then I remembered they just opened down the road from me! I went and got 3 salads, two large drinks, and a kids protein box for $29. Which isn't that bad being that it's healthy and a drive through place. I was really impressed, by the time I pulled up to the window my order was ready. My two year old actually ate his dinner, and he's the pickiest kid with his food. I got the antipasto salad and it was so much, I couldn't finish it and put it in the fridge. My mom and boyfriend got the BBQ ranch salad and they really liked it. Highly recommend this place, especially if you want something easy and good for you."}
{"text":"Normally not  a big fan of salads but the Cesar salad with chicken and the strawberry and spinach smoothie from here are sooo good !!!"}
{"text":"Food is alright but they need to be more consistence. I ordered 2 of the same burrito and they were completely different, not to mention all the \"good stuff\" was in a glob at the bottom of the burrito."}
{"text":"For 5 and 1/2 bucks for Greek salad (with kale) was amazing!! Delicious, filling, healthy and cheap. Wish we had one of these where we live."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and convenient. The salad I had was so good and I recommend coming here if you want to eat healthier on the go."}
{"text":"Stopped by because it was close to where I was. This is the best cheap salad drive thru place I've ever been to. Please open one in Scottsdale and in Tempe"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's so yummy and they are very professional and have quality food. Their staff is awesome and are always happy to see us! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fast, fair and friendly service. Salads and soups are top notch."}
{"text":"I've been hearing so many good things about this place that I just had to give it a try. So today I stopped by for lunch. The workers there, were very friendly and helpful. I ordered the Cobb salad and the BBQ chicken wrap. The salad was a nice big serving, that was good and very filling. The wrap was not like I've seen at other restaraunts, it was a huge  burrito size, and also very good! So I'm giving them 5 stars.. Oh, and I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Salad for dinner? U bet my wife had the Santa Fe wrap with steak delicious! I had the Caesar wrap with chicken I will definitely get it again. Very filling and make sure to quench your thirst with the cucumber mint lemonade tasty. Great service Great Food we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick lunch to return to work. This was my first time and I'm from out of town so a salad drive-through definitely intruded me. There was barely a line, and the person who took my order at the drive-through was extremely patient and nice. She let me take my time to look at the menu and ask questions. I ended up going with the Strawberry and Sweet Potato salad and customized it by removing goat cheese & romaine and replace with mozzarella. The salad has quinoa, sweet potatoes, strawberries, mixed greens, and dressing. I added chicken which is an additional cost. I also ordered a strawberry and spinach smoothie. My total came out to be a little more than $12, which is not bad. After ordering, I turned the corner to pay and to my surprise, my salad was already ready! I turned around to place the salad down in my passenger seat and then my smoothie was ready. Very impressed with the speed of the service. The cashier was very friendly at the window too.   As for the food, the smoothie wasn't very sweet, but probably due not adding additional sugar. It was organic and decent. For the salad, it is a huge portion and decent too. Not the best I've had, but for the price and service, it was good. Great place to swing by to grab lunch quickly."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy, fast and fresh food. I love the smoothies and three bean chili. And they always have great customer service."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great value! My coworker told me about how good they are....I never really had the desire to drive thru before...but I am so glad I did.  The salads are HUGE, really enough for 2 people! People were so  nice and friendly. This is better than salads you get at pretty much any  counter or sit down restaurant. I think I will be tasting everything on the menu sooner than later. They even have great options for kids!"}
{"text":"I love Salads and Go, I have been to other locations, but this one has become my favorite. Daisy is amazing and always has a smile on her face. They let me be \"that\" customer who always has to modify something and they do it happily with a smile on their face. I love the fact that I can get healthy amazing choices that my whole family can agree on. I love the greek salad and the mixed greens with apples. My kids love the BBQ ranch salad, soups and kids meals.  Everyone is friendly, food is great value for the cost and I am excited to see new options all the time! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and the breakfast burrito bowl was GREAT! Very tasty! Nice size portion and very affordable! I also got a Caesar Salad with chicken. Again, nice size portion! I will for sure be a regular here! Very happy they opened this place by my job! The customer service was very welcoming! Great service. I hope they continue on this great track record!"}
{"text":"I love salad and go and I eat there all the time the reason for the negative review is this location has gotten my order wrong the only two times I've ever been there. I travel for my job and hit all this locations as I love the healthy fresh option on the go however I would avoid this location every other salad and go get the five stars!"}
{"text":"As per some Yelp recommendations I got the BBQ Ranch with the honey wrap and YUM! Quick service, friendly staff, and most importantly super yummy wrap!"}
{"text":"I was loving the salads here for the last week, I recently started a job in the area and was excited to find an inexpensive place for salad. That was, until today when I found multiple bug pieces in my salad! Never going back."}
{"text":"The Santa Fe salad is my favorite! I have been here countless time, so satisfying! Never disappoints, fresh quality you can taste! Love that it's fast and convenient , but still healthy! Way to Go!"}
{"text":"The Santa Fe salad is my favorite! I have been here countless time, so satisfying! Never disappoints, fresh quality you can taste! Love that it's fast and convenient , but still healthy! Way to Go!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few time and enjoyed it. On this particular occasion I received the completely wrong wrap. When I called to notify the location, my calls just rang until a message came on advising they were not taking calls.   I asked for a classic chicken Caesar wrap and got this instead.   Note: I ate the wrap, but left the content that was inside the wrap . Hey,  it was lunch time. I did not have time to rush out,  and get something else before my next meeting."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, fast and easy .. I thought I'd give this place a shot.. if you know me.. you know I don't usually order the salad .. I like to eat!! But every now and then you have to do it ..  I found this place driving through Mesa.. it has a drive thru window so I figured it would be easy to get in and out of here.. I was right.. even if there are 2 cars ahead of you.. the line moves fast.  You pick a salad from the board add protein if you like .. a smoothie or soup .. they have really good ice tea.. and you're set.. ready to enjoy a healthy meal on the go.  I've had the Cobb salad..  very good avocado, bacon, egg,blue cheese (it didn't need the chicken I added there was plenty of protein) and the jalapeño ranch salad (this one did need the chicken for the added protein) from the specials board it had summer corn, pickled onions, bacon & chicken both were filling, delicious and a great flavor combo..  I will definitely be back for another salad on the go .. can't wait to try all the salad options and narrow it down to my top five favorites and put it in my rotation.. staff here is always very friendly.."}
{"text":"So I went to go get Cobb chicken salad  so I paid extra for chicken and I get 7 small cubes of chicken not happy at all"}
{"text":"Went for the second time today and still love it. The salad  was really fresh and I tried the soup and it was so flavorful packed with chicken and veggies. The lemonade both plain and the blueberry rosemary version are really good too. The drive thru is really what's going to make me a regular customer because with three kids in the back, going in would mean I go far less often to avoid dealing with that hassle."}
{"text":"I had just got done raving about this place to everyone and on my check in. Then as I was enjoying my salad, something caught my eye! It was freaking bug! There is a freaking bug in my salad!!! Wtfffff!! That's unacceptable! I have to go puke now!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My 2 yr old used to be salad obsessed but tapered off recently. Every time I grab a Cobb from here he sits and devours it with me. Smoothies are fantastic."}
{"text":"Salad and Go hit the spot for my salad cravings. I need low carb, and they had the solution - the Cobb salad without tomatoes and substitute in the Asian vinaigrette dressing. It was excellent. Service was prompt and courteous. I took advantage of the outdoor seating, enjoyable. I recommend Salad and Go for your salad dining needs."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few years ago and just wasn't impressed but recently I thought I'd try again and I'm glad I did. I am now addicted to the chicken Cesar. It's soooo good. The dressing has a little kick to it and the chicken has some extra pepper but it's just the right amount. Together this salad is my all time fav!! Oh! And the croutons are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great for quick and healthy lunch. The driveway thru is quick even during the lunch rush and my order is always right."}
{"text":"Cool spot w really good salads.  Vegetarian vegetable soup was really good as was the salad w apples. Very quick service and decent prices.  Will be back next time in surprise for sure"}
{"text":"So sad they don't have these in Texas! You get so much bang for your buck here. Great tasting and great prices."}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY that there's a Salad and Go on this side of Mesa. I've been here four times in the last few months and everything I've ordered has been fresh and delicious. There was only one time that the bacon that came with my Cobb salad was a little too chewy for my taste, but I've never had a problem with it since. Their chili is fabulous and the salad portions are huge! They pack so many flavors inside a small-looking container. The drive through is a plus for someone like me that doesn't want to haul my kids out of the car, especially on a hot Arizona day. It's also a plus that isn't healthy fast food options!!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible at getting your order right. The last 3 times I've been here my order has had something wrong with it. Most recently they made my wrap as a salad, when I corrected them before driving off with it they asked what type of tortilla I wanted it to be I. And when I got home it was wrong! How the heck do you put it in the wrong tortilla when you JUST asked me what kind. Of all the things to mess up that's the least of my concerns as I have had no meat when I paid for chicken, dressing mixed in when asked for it on the side, bacon on my salad when requesting no bacon.  I'm hoping the new location on power does a better job than this place. The food is good but it's such a pain to know your order will be wrong in some way."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I ordered the Ceasars salad with chicken and dressing mixed in it. The chicken is salty and I'm not even sure about the dressing as there's so little that I really can't taste it. Disappointed. Not worth  the over $7 I paid."}
{"text":"That a place so awesome is so far from civilization is literally the least fair scenario I've encountered in quite some time! Salad & Go lives up to its name--it's a fast food spot centered around greens--and lots of them. And while it's a bummer there's only outside seating, it's still one of my new favorite places to grab dinner.   I started off with a salad that had goat cheese, strawberries, and sweet potatoes. It was HEAVY. Really packed with some good stuff--none of that iceberg lettuce crap you'll see elsewhere. Paired with a vinaigrette, every bite was bursting with flavor. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I added the mock chicken, a choice of several proteins to the mix, and it did not disappoint.   And because I'm a glutton who tries several items before reviewing a spot, I had to load up on beverages as well. The kale-banana smoothie is already one of my faves. I love how it's not so loaded with sugar, and the strong ginger flavor really shines. The cucumber-mint lemonade is good, and tastes so much like a mojito I wanted to spike it with some rum!   Finally, I've gotta point out that a lot of diners complain about healthy food being expensive. At less than $6 (before adding protein), this is dirt cheap! I'll be back to try some of the leaner salads, and even some of the richer salads, like the Southwest Caesar. I may even add chicken and get it as a wrap, an option for all items.   This isn't your average salad bar, so give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's like someone once heard The Simpsons say \"you don't win friends with salad\" and dedicated their life to telling Matt Groening & Co they're absolutely freaking wrong.   You absolutely WILL impress your friends with this stuff.  Let's face it, the vast majority of salads worldwide are mediocre. Pedestrian AF. Filler on the menu. Throwaway token dish for vegetarians. An afterthought!   I, for one, am tired of this crap. And I was even more tired of S&G only opening in the middle of nowhere. Lo and behold, salvation is here! Starting from the low, low price of roughly $6, you can come and get a wide variety of salads, wraps, and smoothies from this drive through.   I'm currently enjoying their Fall special with feta, bacon, red onions, and candied pecans. Be jealous."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious fresh salads! We highly recommend this location, the staff is always kind and welcoming. They take special requests and are always accurate."}
{"text":"Fun little place. The drive thru was packed but I guess that's a good sign. I ordered the southwest ceaser w/ steak. I didn't care for the steal much but overall the salad was good and I LOVED the Poblano ceaser dressing!! I also ordered a chicken chowder that I really liked. My wife got the Cobb salad w/ chicken and really liked it a lot. Of course, we had to try the smoothies....I got the Tropical green smoothie and my wife went with the strawberry and spinach smothie, we were impressed with both.   I love having a quick healthy alternative when eating out in Surprise. Hope they do well and stick around!"}
{"text":"So, so pleased with this place! Drive through or outside seating salad joint. Quick and delicious. Very, very friendly and knowledgeable staff! I had the Asian salad with a cucumber mint lemonade. Everything was fantastic! Great portions, and unbeatable prices. Definitely will be back! Gave 4/5 stars just due to the fact that as a vegan, there were only about 2 options I had to choose from. Would love to see more, but still happy there were any vegan options at all! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"So I normally have to trick myself into eating vegetables by putting it in smoothies or roasting them with salt and pepper but I don't really fuck with salads because it's too boring and I'm usually still hungry but I just had this place for the first time and it was hella good. If you're trying to be healthier but don't really ever crave salads try this place, it's bomb. Oh and it's really affordable."}
{"text":"Love this new healthy fast food place in the neighborhood!! I got the Caesar in a wrap and a breakfast smoothie. For something healthy, I thought these were great! They give you the option to put everything in a salad or in a wrap so I like that variety. There are also seasonal menu items, and a few breakfast options.  The drive-thru is a definitely plus! The service was friendly and QUICK. There's a few seats outside, but other than that, this place is best if you want something healthy and quick at the same time. Will definitely come back and try other items."}
{"text":"My sweet husband took me over here because I'm on a salad kick.  I had a bacon jalapeño ranch with shrimp and it was really good. Honestly the best salad I've ever had in a drive-thru. The dressing was really spicy, but I washed it down with a watermelon lemonade.  I am sad because this is really far for us.  There should be one of these in every city. There are not enough healthy, quick options you can drive-thru."}
{"text":"I noticed salad n go recently opened a new location right down the street from where I work. I waited until one of my coworkers tried it and upon her rave reviews I decided to give it a try. I wish I would have tried it sooner, everything was so good! I got in the drive thru line with 3 cars ahead of me and expected a long wait. Nope, under 4 minutes and I was leaving the parking lot. Not only were the staff fast, they were also extremely friendly. These factors alone would be enough to bring me back for even mediocre food. Luckily the food was also delicious. I had the BBQ Ranch salad and although bbq ranch dressing sounded kinda weird, I went with their recommendation and am glad I did. I love that you can order separate protein as well, and they even have a \"chicken substitute\" for us vegetarians and vegans. Now my salad was delicious, but they also featured a vegetable chili as one of their seasonal soups. I had to try it, as I was excited that someone made chili without meat! It was delicous. So fragrant, just the right amount of spice, and plenty of beans and veggies. I will be back for more of this, probably later this week!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the strawberry and sweet potato salad and their cucumber lemonade! Kids meals are affordable, healthy, and yummy! This is a family favorite!"}
{"text":"The entrance, exit, and the parking lot are not well laid out and are simply dangerous. It's stupid. However, the salads are good and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Legit awesome. A friend recommended this place a week ago and I've now been here 3 times in 4 days. First, I had the Sante Fe wrap with chicken. Great flavor and it was all so fresh. Honestly, I would have liked it better without the chicken because the veggies were delicious. I got the breakfast bowl (egg whites, bacon, potatoes and spinach with a light dressing in there) today and was really impressed with the flavor and, again, the freshness. We got a smoothie and my son actually loved it- and it has beets in it- score!  Their staff is super friendly and the gal that helped us yesterday made sure she asked our names so she could get to know the regulars.   Keep these guys in business!"}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place!!!! Delicious healthy salads, great customer services, super fast drive through (unbelievably fast) awesome affordable prices! I could eat here every Day!"}
{"text":"\"Lettuce\" rejoice, there is a great new salad place in town! All jokes aside, Salad and Go is fantastic. You can drive through or walk up to the window to order. Quick, friendly service. We enjoyed the Roasted Sweet Potato and Strawberry salad. It was a generous portion of fresh, great tasting ingredients for a great price! Finally, a healthy, fast option without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Heaven in a bowl, wrap or cup! I'm so happy they opened a new Chandler location. Healthy and fast!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place today.  The drive through was packed. So was all the outside seating. You can opt to walk up to the order window located on the patio. BTW: There is about 5 tables with outdoor seating only. Circled around and decided to wait in the line of the drive thru. About 5 cars in front of us at 1:15 PM.  Got the Southern Caesar Salad. Plenty for two to split. Added a small cup of the Chicken Pot Pie soup and a strawberry/ spinach smoothie.  I felt it's a little pricey (almost $17) Salad served with a fresh salsa, sliced radishes, shredded kale and tortilla chips on top. It was just ok.  The soup was extremely hot (temperature wise). Chunks of red potatoes, carrots, peas & chicken. Where's the \"pot pie\"? LOL Wasn't a fan, not a lot of flavor and somewhat bland the broth had an after taste of tap water.  The best purchase was the smoothie. Expensive ( at almost $5), but my daughter really enjoyed it and was surprised how you couldn't even taste or recognize the spinach.  I really think this place is all about the hype and less about bang. Tried it, but don't really have a desire to go back."}
{"text":"The nicest people, the freshest salads, great prices. I'm an instant fan. And my whole family gives it a big thumbs up.   Cobb salad, jalapeño ranch wrap, and a ranch salad. All three of us loved our dinner. Honestly, I'm excited to go back.   The girl at the window that took my order is such a great ambassador for the brand. I have nothing they can work on. It's is a novel concept and very well executed."}
{"text":"Two words my dudes: food poisoning. Very concerning considering I don't even eat meat....they must not be washing their lettuce? Shame, because they're salads, though excessively expensive, were pretty tasty. Onto greener (and hopefully cleaner) pastures!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Crazy good salads from a drive thru!!  Tried their Greek and the chalkboard special Brussel Sprout & Bacon.  Great flavor and no skimping on the ingredients.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always friendly and helpful staff.  I've only had thier salads,  maybe one of these days I'll be adventurous and try something new!"}
{"text":"Favorite healthy fast food option. The Greek Salad with chicken is my favorite, healthier dressings are also avaliable. I love how fast they are."}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, tasty, and inexpensive! What more could you ask for? For the price I believe it was a quality salad and I love you get to pick a protein if you want. Every time I order a new salad and each one is enjoyable. Salad and go is the only way to fast food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fresh salads for $5.74, plus extra for chicken. My order was always ready just as quickly as I pulled up to the window. I love the healthy \"fast food\" alternative. They had me at nitrite-free bacon and homemade dressings!   This is a drive-thru with some outside seating options. Very convenient. Generous portion size. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm moving to California where there is no Salad and Go. :( extremely sad. The cob salad wrap on honey wheat omg.... I hope they open one in California.  MODESTO CALIFORNIA to be exact."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ chicken salad. Great choice! A lot cheaper than most salad Places. The portion size was big."}
{"text":"I was excited to give this place a try after reading a lot about it.  I had been craving the Caprese with Steak salad.  Get there to order at 4:30 pm on a Friday, and they tell me they are all out of steak. OK, so I settled for the chicken and ordered two other salads to take home for the wife and daughter that they had picked out on the web.  For a salad place, it took a long time to get the food.  Get home and one of the salads is wrong. Not even close to what I orderded and talk about stingy with dressing.  For the cost, it would be much cheaper to make my own salad at home not to mention quicker and I would know it was the salad I wanted.  I doubt that I will eat there again. There is no compelling reason to do so."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre.  The menu is very limited. Panera is much better with many more choices."}
{"text":"This place is the best! They have something for everyone, even the kids! They have healthy, delicious options. Always get our order perfect and a drive thru. Who could ask for more??"}
{"text":"A good salad, prepared to order, at a great price. Twice now, I have had the Santa Fe salad, no cheese, light dressing mixed in, with chicken added. It was great both times. The second visit I also bought the chicken and wild rice soup. It had a great taste and was quite full of ingredients, not too brothy. Both times my salads were fresh and the soup very hot. A much healthier alternative to anything else this \"fast.\" Both times I went through the drive through and spent less than 3 minutes."}
{"text":"So excited when this new Salad And Go location opened up in the Fiesta District area!  Great healthy options for lunch and breakfast.  Salads are delicious and really filling, you can add chicken (or double chicken), steak, shrimp or even gardein chicken strips (if you're into that sort of thing).  Also love the mango iced tea and the green smoothies!  Great spot when you want something healthy on the go, instead of another burger/donut/fried food/etc.  They can also do any salad as a wrap too if you need some carbs to hit your macros!  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Usually amazing but tonight i ordered an Asian wrap with shrimp and got a Caesar wrap with shrimp ."}
{"text":"I have been here 3x now and no complaints. I have had the Cobb salad, and the chxn Cesar twice. It's a great place because you're getting high end fast food service. You never wait in line longer than 5-7 minutes. The salads are an amazing portion. Leaving you satisfied not stuffed. This is a great drive thru salad place. Only down fall is I wish it was not 20 minutes from my house/work, still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Where do I begin! This is my go to healthy drive thru spot. It's affordable, salads all go for less than $10 and will leave you full. The line is never too long of a wait. Also they have a breakdown of he cal/fat nutrition info on their menu which is nice too see as well. I wish there was one closer to me, but the drive is definitely worth it at the moment."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Life Changing! Large portions, huge flavors, fresh high quality ingredients.  Salad to go is my new favorite salad place!"}
{"text":"Well    I  just went for first time  with my daugther  and husband   We love it   They  r so gooood  I will go back  for sure  and the menu  not Spence's  I like their price better then  other places  good plates  they r  friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing place to get some quality salads! Everything is flavorful, you can't get a bad salad. It's like fast food but healthy, I love it. We drive out from Tempe just to get a nice salad. The employees are extremely friendly and their prices are great. Recommend it 100%"}
{"text":"Bought lunch here recently and it was just decent. I liked that they had a drive thru, it was quick and easy to get me and my fiancé lunch on our work breaks. I got the sante Fe salad with chicken and it was very dry, even with the dressing, and quite bland. My fiancé got the southwest Caesar wrap and he said it was very bland for a Caesar wrap. It was a good way to get quick food, but the taste wasn't there."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a regular for us! So excited to see a drive through with healthy options! I've tried the Santa Fe and the barbecue chicken ranch and I loved everything I ordered so far. I finally ordered it in a wrap and I was not disappointed. It was so filling even without meat. Fast service with amazing food. Hoping to see more of these pop around the area!"}
{"text":"Fast food salad! Such a good idea.  I eat here several times a week now and have yet to get sick of it. My favorite off the main menu is the Mixed Greens and Apple, but their seasonal options have yet to disappoint and are worth checking out as well :)    They take their salads seriously. I was talking to one of the employees once and he was telling me their chef sampled 7 different types of feta cheese before settling on the one he used for their current seasonal special, the Harvest Salad. That to me speaks serious dedication to their flavor profile, and it shows!   Staff (at least at this location) is super friendly, fast, and has yet to mess up my order. And I've given some pretty big orders now that half my office is as into the place as I am, haha.  I think the portions are pretty decent for the price (including portions for added meat) but they offer the salads in wrap form if you want something more filling. It's delicious either way."}
{"text":"Salad and Go is good if you want healthy fast food. Not good if you are on a budget though. Everytime I have gone through it has always been fresh and they were always friendly. Its pretty basic selection of salads and wraps. I was hoping for it to be more like D'Lish but its not that good..."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good for the fact that I had to get the balsamic dressing with the Asian salad in order to make it vegan. I would ask for the dressing on the side unless you like a lot of dressing on your salads. Mine came on the side, but I'm not sure if that's because I changed the order. It seemed like a lot of dressing and I only used about a third of what they gave me and thought that it was still a lot.   Their juice was good!  Since they don't have any indoor seating and it actually looks like a mainly drive thru place it was nice that they had tables outside and misters to keep you cool while eating. It was funny to watch people go by after ordering salads through their car windows. Get out and stretch your legs! Be healthy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I haven't gotten anything here that I didn't like. I usually drive thru on my way to work and get a salad that I keep for lunch. The salads are gigantic by the way and I usually can't finish it in one sitting. I work in Scottsdale so the price point is a lot better than if I went somewhere out there for lunch. Sometimes I feel like one dressing isn't enough but it's hit or miss. I've gotten in the habit of just asking for two. Great place I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning and ordered a Quinoa Berry Breakfast Bowl sans the berries and it was amazing. I requested they add a drizzle honey and I really enjoyed every bite! Quality ingredients, phenomenal recipe for sweet quinoa and the delicious peanut butter topping made this a dish you really need to try! I plan on stopping by tonight to try the quinoa and sweet potato salad. Love this place!!! Oh ... And once everyone at the office got a look at my breakfast and stuck their greedy little spoons in for a taste, I now have orders to pick up for them tomorrow! Great location, drive thru was fast and service was super friendly. Will definitely be back! Often!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but last few visits they been changing...lately when I order my shrimp Caesar wrap, all the shrimp is together on one half, and whole cherry tomatoes on the other half...wtf. I have to open it up and mix the ingredients lol."}
{"text":"This place is a Revelation! My family of 3 has grazed here twice in the week it's been open. Tried 6 different salads, and they were all beautiful, incredibly fresh; and with ingredients we might never have tried all together- but they blend fantastically. Chef Patino certainly knows how to make taste buds sing! Bravo!"}
{"text":"I like coming here - it's close by my work. Their options are good. The staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is super tasty and fast. The food is fresh, healthy and affordable! I'm so happy there's more and more locations opening!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Its typically quick, friendly service and theyve never once gotten our order incorrect. Fresh, healthy, delicious food with calorie counts listed. Would love more options for kids meals, but other than that the place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times.  I understand its a \"fast food grab and go\" experience which it has been.  Also I understand \"healthier options\" usually cost more, I am no stranger to that.  But every time I get this place, it's been... not worth the money in my opinion.    I get the \"Asian\" wrap because that is the ONLY vegan option they have, which to me is sort of weird because they are a \"Health Food\" place and it would honestly change the game for them if they had MORE vegan options other than the \"Asian\" wrap.  Every time I get this wrap I also add their \"Chicken Substitute\" which is a marinated gardein chicken strip.  In order to add that gardein strip it costs an addition $2.50 on top of the $6.00 +tax you are already paying for the wrap.   you are sort of forced to add this though because in all honesty the \"asian\" wrap really does not have to much in it.  The only problem is a gardein strip is tiny, and pretty much what they do is take ONE strip and cut it in to cubes and since it sits there it gets pretty tough to chew.   So in retrospect you are paying $2.50 for a single tiny gardein strip... $6.00 for the wrap... +tax... Brings it to $10 if you want a vegan safe wrap, which is NOT organic by the way..  And I just cant justify that.  The other issue is that they put too much sauce in the wrap, so EVERY TIME I get this wrap it just falls apart when I open it and the tortilla is completley soaked and mushy not even half way through.  Its a total mess and just unpleasant experience.  The sauce in the asian wrap was tasty though so I will give them 2 stars for that.  But I just cant seem to find a happy medium with this place.  I dont plan to return, even if it is the only \"vegan safe\" place by my work."}
{"text":"Great prices, great food! Great service, too! I love this little place. They don't sell soda either which I thought was cool. That's pretty progressive, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The worst soup I have ever had. It was thicker then chili. I would not go here and eat again if you paid me."}
{"text":"I've always tried to make a more healthier decision at times for lunch whenever I'm on the go. Glad that a Salad & Go opened up in my area as I find myself circling back her as I'm always on the move.   Don't get me wrong, I enjoy reading thru Yelp reviews of friends and exploring new spots (that will never change), but this satisfies a lot for me and the best thing is that they can turn any salad into a wrap if you gotta eat & drive.   Menu is simple with lots of options. I've been doing the Cobb salad no onions, w/chicken and adding olives and cucumbers. Right now, no additional charge to add an Item or to swamp our dressing.   Other protein options include steak, tofu, shrimp and something else so u can definitely mix up your salad. The proteins are extra $ but I walk out (drive thru) spending no more than $8.  They also do breakfast so I may try next week."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Cesar salad and a passion ice tea. The portion size was perfect-more than enough. The Cesar dressing is so creamy and delicious and I even ordered the light version. It was very flavorful. I also enjoyed the Parmesan cheese they sprinkled in it as well as the croutons. The chicken was okay, not super flavorful but not bland either. I wonder how it's cooked because it didn't have grill marks or anything. Nonetheless for a salad and drink I paid a little less than $10. I feel like it was a tad bit overpriced but considering it's a drive thru salad place that specializes in salad, it's all about supply and demand! It wasn't the best salad I've ever had, but it was better than any other fast food salad that's for sure."}
{"text":"Love the salads here! Shrimp Cobb salad is my favorite. However the Greek salad is amazing as well. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great salads with quality ingredients. I've never had a salad here that I didn't like. My go-to salad is the southwest caesar.   What I really want to talk about are the rolled breakfast tacos. They are mini burritos with egg whites, cheese, and spinach. They are accompanied by the best salsa in the world. I want jars and jars of this salsa. It is so fresh, it has the right amount of spice, and is garlic-forward which I enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome salads! And great prices!! Can't wait for the queen creek location to open up"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting this opening and I'm not disappointed! It was super busy so there was some chaos in and around parking lot - driver error - there are clearly marked arrows to direct flow but people just weren't following along. I opted to order at the window and despite the lunch rush my order was ready quickly and everyone was super pleasant and efficient! I had a smoothie and the power wrap which were great. The smoothie even stayed cold for a long time in this heat without tasting icy or watered down! Thank you for these affordable, healthy options on the go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love the healthy and fresh options they have. It's fast food, but not greasy and disgusting like other fast food restaurants. They have a drive-thru window for convenient pick up. The team members there are always nice. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm kind of obsessed with this place. Not because it has the greatest salads on earth, but because it has a drive through and walk up window. Having never seen a fast food salad place before this is quite a novelty. Plus it is really cheap and pretty good quality. I always get the Cobb with steak."}
{"text":"So good! One of my favorite lunch/dinner spots. Really generous portions. They also have a great kids menu."}
{"text":"Wow! Please open one in Goodyear, Waddell or surprise. Please.  Extremely fresh. The salad recipes are excellent. Loved it."}
{"text":"Salad and go has become my all time favorite place to eat! The salads, wraps & smoothies (kale & banana) are just delish. So many choices and even my picky eater kids enjoy the protein box. I opt for the protein box as well when on the go."}
{"text":"Love this place. Anytime I can't think of what's for dinner, Salad and Go is my go to. They've never messed up and order and are always exactly what I expect."}
{"text":"I love something quick that is actually healthy! I had the BBQ chicken salad and it was great. They also have a kids menu which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to be confrontational about bad experiences but I think the one I just had with this location was just plain dumb. I ordered my salad and because I'm not a meat eater I didn't specify that I wanted any meat on top. And maybe it was my fault that I didn't say anything but I'm used to the cashier asking me if I do want protein. The girl taking my order didn't even ask and just assumed I wanted the cold gross chicken they serve. So when I got my salad with chicken on top I went up to the window and politely asked the same girl if I could get one without the meat. Literally 2 minutes later some guy handed me back the same salad with the chicken still on top."}
{"text":"My salad was huge, yummy, relatively cheap and I got it in less than a minute, what else can I say?"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to visit Salad and Go for a long time.  So, while over in Surprise, I stopped in and ordered a Cobb Salad.  Drive thru was a bit busy but, since it was about high noon, that was to be expected.  Even at that I was in and out in about five minutes.  From sturdy fork (why can't every fast food joint provide a decent fork?...it's the little things, people!) to salad my Cobb Salad was first rate.  Fresh, crispy, quality greens, lots of grape tomatoes, a whole boiled egg attractively sliced, generous bacon portions, tasty blue cheese crumbles and a blue cheese dressing in a little pack for self serving.    I was very hungry but could not finish the salad....extremely generous salad here.    So, one of the winning ways to woo customers is to charge a fair price and provide the finest possible ingredients and this salad fit the bill.  I have only one suggestion.  Though I'm not familiar with their business model...what they need to make a decent profit, but I would suggest they start making something like a \"go cup\" at about half the full salad pricing.  I'm a pretty healthy eater but couldn't eat this one today.  And a \"go cup\", perhaps served in a medium sized smoothie cup would be a fine thing to pick up and take home to accompany a meal at home.  Living alone, I've found my veggies go bad before I can use them up.  I'd be more than willing to \"fork out\" (pardon the pun) $3.00 for a \"half salad\".  So, keep up the good work, Salad And Go.  Don't get greedy, keep serving quality salads...and thanks again for that sturdy orange spoon!"}
{"text":"Healthiest fast food ever. I am glad to see new locations are opening. For a person out looking for a quick yet healthy meal, this is the place. Taste has been mastered too. Delicious & Nutritious is where it is at! Also, though you will pay for quality and convenience, it is still a great value. You could certainly make food like this at home when you have time. This place fills fits the bill when you don't."}
{"text":"It is really refreshing and makes me happy to see a salad DRIVE THRU place! They were really quick and efficient and had my salad ready basically by the time I got up to the window. My only caveat is a little bit of inconsistency. I've been here a few times and sometimes I feel like they skimp on the chicken. If I'm gonna pay basically $8 for a salad, it should have a decent amount of chicken, just saying. I will definitely keep coming back though!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.. awesome, tasty salads at a reasonable price!! Outstanding!! Staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  If you are a salad fan, this place does not disappoint. I love every salad I've tried which includes the Greek, Asian, BBQ Ranch, and the southwest one.  All delicious, and a generous serving size.  I also love the lemonades here!  Cucumber mint is my favorite.  I also love every smoothie I have tried here! Another great thing is the service is always very friendly and fast!  If you want healthy and delicious in a drive through setting, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I love salad and go. Awesome HUGE salads, and I love the  chia seed parfait. Little pricey but again, the salads are quite large. There was a large line at the drive through this morning and none at the walk up so I thought maybe I'd save some time! Wrong. I was completely ignored for about 5 minutes, then another 10 before I got the parfait I ordered. Meanwhile, about 6 or 7 cars went through. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This place just opened and had to try it. Let me start off by saying that they have an amazing selection of breakfast wraps, salads and smoothies. I have tried 2 of their salads already and both have been great! The chicken added to the salads is amazing! Fill of flavor. I also had the chia pudding parfait which is a dessert in a cup! So good! Their coffee is good too. I also tried their soup which I enjoyed as well. As you can see I have tried a lot in 2 visits and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Salad n Go but saw it on Gilbert Rd yesterday as I was leaving a film shoot. I approached the walk-up serving window and waited in line behind another young lady who appeared to be requesting additional salad dressing. She and I were the only two people in line - once the window server helped the young lady in front of me, she shut the walk up window in my face. I started a conversation with the lady leaving the window, I just wanted to know if the food was any good, (because the service was showing early signs of lack-luster). The young lady said this was her 'first time dining here,' that's when NATE walked up and said, \"Are you considering eating here? Their salads are the best and I love them.\" Great!, I said. Nate then approached the window and started to facilitate dialogue about the establishment between me and the walk-up window worker. Basically, he was trying to get her to chime in and tell me how good their salads were -- but she was uninterested. Nate must be the best patron ever, because he then asked for the manager to come to the window, to confirm how fresh and organic their food is, but when the window clerk called him to the window, (keep in mind we can see him, as this is a small establishment, no bigger than a drive through sonic), he didn't budge. He looked towards the window and saw Nate and I standing there, and said, \"For what?.\"   I then asked the window clerk for a menu, and she responded in the most dry tone, \"We don't have one.\" Nate asked if the establishment was online and asked for the URL. The window clerk jotted it down on the back of receipt paper and handed it to him. Nate handed the SaladandGo.com url to me. I thanked him for his time and personal review of the establishment. He was merely a dining guest. He doesn't work there and if it weren't for him, they wouldn't have gotten the 1-star, I did render, (besides the fact that there wasn't a \"NO-STAR\" option.)   Will I patronize them in the future? Likely not, especially at the GILBERT Rd. LOCATION. However, Nate assured me, the service is much better at any of their other establishments & attempted to place the blame on the Gilbert Location being NEW. It's really too bad they didn't want to acknowledge me or serve me yesterday, because I was hungry as heck, and I really LOVE writing AWESOME REVIEWS about Great Food and Customer service.   Well I tried and THANKS NATE!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the salads here, I get the caprese w/ chicken most often. The drive thru is pretty quick but can get backed up at times. The people are very nice and that is a plus in my book :)"}
{"text":"Salad and Go: Okay, focus on Salads...but I am here to announce their breakfast is fast and filling...also decently healthy. Get the Peanut Butter Wrap-- yes you can make that in your home, but the point is that a delicious breakfast that won't make your pores greasy, is available for consideration. I will agree with the other reviews...if you get a salad it is a hit or miss regarding the meat. I have been here several times and it is a hit or miss. Sometimes I am surprised and pleased for the amount of chicken I receive, and then other times I feel my meat is playing hide-and-seek."}
{"text":"God has blessed us with such a magnificent place!! I wish they would open one closer to Phoenix! I always get the sale with sweet potatoes and steak with balsamic dressing! The Line is always quick and convenient, the staff is usually friendly! I will Definitely come back here when I want a salad that will truly fill you up!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Greek salad and artichoke soup and once again was absolutely pleased with the friendly and quick service. Not only was the location speedy, my soup was delicious and hot, my salad was phenomenal. Wish there were more locations but, definitely willing to drive for the food with how great it is."}
{"text":"Love the FRESH ingredients, the variety of seasonal options, the friendly staff and GREAT prices.  The BBQ Ranch Salad/Wrap is my favorite and go to order unless the Jalapeno Ranch is offered."}
{"text":"Every time I've come here for breakfast, they either don't have what I wanted to order or they are closed completely. I've tried to get the warm berry quinoa bowl 3 different times now and I have still not been able to order it. They supposedly serve breakfast from 6:30 to 10:30 on weekdays, and every time I have gone they have told me it's unavailable. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the salads are decent sized and they're usually very filling."}
{"text":"UPSETTING. After trying this place out, I was clearly upset. I am now a Salad-and-Go addict. I didn't think that salads could turn out to be THIS good. I now have to drive 20 minutes out, from Goodyear to Tolleson for a dang salad.  I've only been here twice but it doesn't get anymore perfect for me. The pricing is great, salads start at $5.74 but go up depending on if you add proteins or not. I love to add chicken to my salads, so it is a little extra but it isn't bad at all. My favorite salad here is the BBQ Ranch with added chicken. They give you the right amount or salad, dressing toppings everything! They're big salads too! So Fresh! So Scrumptious!  The second time I came, I got the same exact salad, I couldn't steer away, but today I did get the chance to enjoy a Tropical Green Smoothie, which I believe was 4.74. Option to add protein is available. It definitely tasted healthy, less sweet, very green and earthy green tasting, but still very enjoyable.  There is seating but only outside seating, so if you're looking for a lunch date out, prepare for weather conditions, we've caught wind once. I'd say this is a downfall for me because I enjoy outings, but then again, it is a grab and go kind of place, so no star deducted there.  I enjoy that the pricing is very affordable, even for healthy food! My sister and I each got a salad both with added protein and two smoothies. 2 hefty salads + 2 healthy smoothies = $26.51.  I also enjoy that the staff members here are so quick, and they get you outta there in a jiffy, whether you use the window or the drive through. I mean I guess you grab a \"Salad-and-Go\"!"}
{"text":"After my workout at the gym, I decided to give this place a try for dinnertime.  Location & Aesthetics -- located at the corner of Bell and Litchfield behind Buffalo Wild Wings.  Lots of available parking if you eating there though there's no dining inside as the place is too small for that.  You can dine outside as they've got some tables and chairs (outdoors) though I didn't see any misters on my recent visit. Their main strength, in my opinion, is the drive through which I find to be an innovative concept as we mostly associate a drive through with fast food.  However, in this case, you'll be using the drive through to order your salad. Outside area was very clean and well kept.  Tables (from what I saw) were clean as well.  Service -- Staff (both via the drive through and interacting with them at the window) were very friendly and helpful.  Any questions I had about the menu and variety of salads they sold were quickly explained.  Service via the drive through was very quick despite being the only one in the queue.  Menu -- Easy to see and read at the drive through, and for the most part, self-explanatory.  Be sure to also note the Seasonal Menu as well as there are items there that might interest you as well.  Food -- I ordered the cobb salad with choice of chicken (you're offered other choices of meat).   The salad was very filling, hearty, delicious, certainly not underweight or light, and didn't scrimp on ingredients.  In fact, ingredients were equally balanced throughout the salad.  Dressing was provided on the side as usual and certainly wasn't underwhelming -- it was more than enough to drizzle twice over the salad!  Overall, very happy with the place, staff, service, and food.  Will definitely recommend and will be returning to try some of their other exciting salad options, and maybe even their healthy drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Love the options for salads. Choose all your own or go with the suggested combinations, which are very flavorful. Everything on my salad was super fresh and made to order, but really quick! The suggested flavor combinations were things I would not have thought of, but went so well together."}
{"text":"I love salad and go! I tried it and the salads are nice and big. I got the Cobb salad but got pobalano Caesar dressing instead of the blue cheese dressing. The peach lemonade was very good as well. Glad surprise has a good healthy fast place"}
{"text":"On Yelp you guys advertise that you're open until 9 p.m. however this is not the case. Drove all the way over there for nothing. Around 730ish I would say. Green corner was opean though. Will probably start going there for my salads."}
{"text":"BUG!! I found a bug IN my salad. I called the 480-304-5662 and it isn't even the number to the Pinnacle Peak Rd location not to mention they don't have a number anywhere on their website that a customer can call incase of an issue with their order. I spoke to a women on the phone that gave me an insincere \"apology\" she didn't even sound surprised or acknowledged the fact that having a bug in your salad is pretty disgusting not to mention UNSANITARY! She told me she needed to ask me a couple of questions to verify my purchase which I was ok with doing. She then told me that she would need to verify the purchase with that location.... Ummm so why would I call you super upset about a bug in a salad that THEY made me if I didn't buy it there!!! So here is the proof that I bought your salad at this location, maybe this company needs to work on the customer service skills."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is a healthy fast food option and I can easily pick up dinner on my way home. I usually get the dressing on the side because they can be generous with the amount and I only like a little dressing.  I have had both the corn chowder and the chicken and rice soups. Loved both."}
{"text":"A perfect combination of speed, value, and taste. I really like the simple menu. They stick what they are good at."}
{"text":"salad was drenched in dressing I got a chicken Cobb salad and there was nothing but lettuce a few tomatoes and no eggs! it was disgusting!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place!!!! Every salad I have had is so good! I recently had the Cobb with chicken in a wrap and the fall lemonade (apple spice I think) and that was super delicious!!! I can't wait to try the winter seasonal salads and lemonade! You can't go wrong with anything fr"}
{"text":"I honestly love this place so much. Many days, I don't have a ton of time for a lunch break. I enjoy being able to stop over at Salad and Go and getting a healthy lunch within minutes from the drive-thru.  The staff is always super friendly and attentive. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is casual, relaxed and fun. It's completely outdoor seating which is perfect for a nice spring day.  My current favorites are the Cobb and Seasonal Greens but I have yet to find a salad I don't like.   I'd definitely recommend Salad and Go! My dog is even a fan since he always get a little pup treat when he comes with. :)"}
{"text":"When did this little \"fast food\" dream end up in my neighborhood? I went to it for lunch the same day I spotted it and ordered the caesar salad with low fat caesar dressing, some rosemary garlic prawns added, and a small lemonade. OMG, the salad was so good. It was fresh, and tasty. They ask you if you want the dressing on the side so you can add it yourself, or have it already placed into salad. That it's a drive-thru is incredible. This will be a go-to spot prior to going to work! This sort of restaurant is so overdue. The staff was very pleasant, and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try yesterday. I ordered the cobb salad with a side of ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing. The portion size of the salad was pretty large for what I paid (around $6). The salad tasted amazing with the bacon, eggs, and avocado. My husband didn't order anything this time but after seeing how much I enjoyed my salad he probably will next time. The staff was quick and friendly and there was no wait time. Keep up the good work Salad and Go!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to see this opening near my house! I went today, and I got the Greek salad. Basically you can get anything as either a salad or a wrap, and it's about $5.75 without a protein. To add meat was like $1.75. The ingredients all tasted really fresh! They have a good selection of salad dressings. They also feature a healthy kids menu. Service was friendly. There were 4 cars in front of me, but service was fast. I got the Greek salad, added chicken and avocado. I had my dog with me and the drive thru girl gave her a treat. The portion size was more than I can eat, so it's definitely a great deal. I will be back, and I am so happy to welcome Salad & Go to my neighborhood. We love you already! :)"}
{"text":"Finally a fast food joint were its ACTUALLY healthy . Super convenient and worth the price . Beats McDonald's salads that is over priced for 3 pieces of lettuce and fatty bacon cheese ,processed chicken."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM! First time here tonight, I always drive by and never stopped but finally decided to go try it out since I literally am 2 minutes away. Best decision ever! Quick and easy ordering, service was nice and my salad and lemonade are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Cannot beat this place! Quick, affordable, healthy AND delicious!! Their dressings are seriously on point (and I am not a \"dressing\" person) - every single one I have tried has been so fresh it literally POPS in your mouth. Their lemonades are the bomb too. My FAVORITE restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent, convenient and fast healthy food is possible!  I typically get two-three salads and eat all week!   Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Love there Cobb Salad! At a good price the salad I can always share or eat it for 2 meals because it is so big!! The smoothies are amazing as well! Good place to start out eating healthy! Also it has a drive thru but it does not have that fast food feel to it!"}
{"text":"I really love this healthy on the go concept. They had a great selection of salads, very quick (even with a long line) and reasonably priced.   I recommend the BBQ Ranch and Southwest Caesar salad. They tasted very fresh and I was impressed with the salad dressings.   I wouldn't recommend the lemonades if you enjoy a tart lemonade. I tried the cucumber and also the strawberry basil lemonade. I personally liked the strawberry basil lemonade the best. I can't wait to come back and try more salads!"}
{"text":"Happy to see a healthy take out place pop up in the neighborhood. Even happier that the food is very tasty! We've been here twice and both times the drive-thru service has been fast and friendly. First time we ordered a salad and a wrap (southwest caeser and cobb), both very good. Second time we came by early in the morning to try the breakfast burritos -- wow, highly recommended! Give them a try."}
{"text":"I LOVE SALAD AND GO!!!! I have never had a bad experience with this place and you can't go wrong with a healthy salad that also tastes amazing! They have so many health conscious options and are reasonably priced (two salads and one drink $20). The service is always good also, I wish they had one closer to my house! My only problem is that I wish they had indoor seating, I know that doesn't fit into their style, but I would like to have a good salad without having to freeze to death on these cold AZ days that have arrived!"}
{"text":"Tried their seasonal Crisp Bacon & Apple salad with chicken and it AMAZING! The maple apple vinaigrette on it was so good that I want to get the recipe. Definitely will be back to try another one of their options! It was hard to pick just one. Love that there is a quick, healthy option - less than 5 minutes through the drive thru. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally, a location on my way home. Excellent choices, good portions and very friendly staff. Went through the drive-through and tried their apple salad and their strawberry salad. Both were flavorful and in sufficient quantities go a meal definitely a go to for me in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place. I found out about it from the two locations in Gilbert, and now have found this one closer to my home in Surprise. Hopefully they will complete their migration by putting one in Surprise--we need one!!! I would eat there every day if they did! The salad I had today was wonderful, the caprese. Quick and friendly and efficient, this is exactly what Surprise needs. Bring it there soon!"}
{"text":"Today felt like soup and the Corn Chowder was actually really good. Unless they fooled me its not from a can all fresh."}
{"text":"Like every Salad and Go I have been to, this location is awesome! They are quick, efficient and always get my order right. Their food is amazing and so fresh. I have never tried something I didn't love. I will be a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Another great location! Fast, friendly service paired delicious, fresh food. Love Salad and Go!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan! Stopped by after work for a work salad. Decided to buy two salads so I could bring one to work for lunch the next day! I tried the Strawberry & Roasted Sweet Potato with chicken, and the Asian salad with steak. Both were so delicious! These are BIG salads. So filling and so yummy! I also got my order super quick! Didn't even wait a minute at the window before my salads were handed to me. I paid $16 and change for 2 salads which I think is a TAD pricey, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome quick fresh salad wraps the Asian with added shrimp is my favorite.  Always get one of the special lemonades they have you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with the idea of drive Thur health foods. Too often working professionals grad \"quick\" meals and can cause us to eat unhealthy foods. It isn't laziness it is convenient health foods.   I like to get the tropical green smoothie with a power wrap (w/o bananas due to allergy). They are super great about food allergies as well!    Their seasonal menus are delicious and the soups are definitely worth a try.   My salad has always been delicious. And I would recommend this to anyone who is a busy bee like me and isn't trying to eat McNasties for lunch."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I'm super lazy and for years have been searching for a fast way to get healthier items. Every salad and smoothie I've gotten has been delicious! They're very accommodating to dietary restrictions and changes that you want to make. I've had the warm quinoa berry bowl a few times and oh my goodness it's so good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to a dr appt. in Gilbert and was headed back to work and I had heard this place had great salads.  I ordered a Cobb salad with chicken and ranch on side. Very good size! It was so filling and fresh. I would return for sure.  Best part they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  My first time there because I wanted something light and it was close.  I had passed this restaurant many times thinking it wouldn't be a good choice.  Was I WRONG!  I had today's special and it was fresh, high quality, very flavorful and a good portion.  Will definitely go back to try the rest of their menu"}
{"text":"Trash ass service I guess the smoothies only come in one size? That's a first then the drive thru girl was rude I told her thank you twice dumb broad just looked at me... that's when your suppose to say your welcome not give me some weak ass stare. Smoothie was mediocre just like the service"}
{"text":"I love that they have a great choice of salads and proteins. Its always fresh and so fast! Also they have delicious breakfast wraps."}
{"text":"Addicted.  Teen daughter LOVED the special bbq chicken salad.  I tried the caprese with steak and YUM!   True confession, I have ordered the children's menu once and it was nice and clean eating.  Great fresh salads and good flavors!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I am able to go and get a great salad, drink, and many more options before I go into work.  The drive through and the staff are great!  I love the Cobb salad!  So if you're looking for a quick healthy meal this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and easy. Close to work. ..looking forward to trying a few of the diff salads.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I've only tried this place a few times so far but it's really good. Loved the ingredients and all the dressing choices. I loved my caprese salad, the mozzarella was perfect. The lemonade is great too. Hannah who took my order was so sweet and helpful. I love getting good customer service! Try it, I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was okay for the first time. Had a cobb salad, which really wasn't much to it. They only give you one dressing but for the size should get two."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing! I got here at 9:10 and they were ready closed and she still made my salads for me. Now that's customer service for you! 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I had never heard about this place until recently.  I am on a Facebook group for the city of Surprise, and they are actually building one of these in Surprise pretty soon.  I had looked them up to see what their menu looked like and what they had to offer. Sounded like a cool concept and they actually had a few things that were right up my alley.  As I was viewing their locations, it turns out that there is one really close to my work on Pinnacle Peak!  I decided that I would head up there for lunch today and try them out.  I got into the drive thru line, placed my order for a Cobb Salad with Chicken and drove up to the window.    The lady at the drive thru counter was very nice!  When I pulled up to pay for my food, I asked her \"How's it going today?\"  She replied in almost near shock.  She told me her day was going swell and that she was happy it was Friday.  She also exclaimed that she was shocked by my question because nobody ever asks her how her day is going.  That is pretty lame, but it doesn't surprise me.  Society as a whole just doesn't give 2 shits anymore.  Everyone is in their own little bubble, glued to their phones, and lots of people don't have any respect or common courtesy/decency anymore (Nobody says, \"Hello.\" or holds doors open, or uses a turn signal etc etc.).  Anyways...I was glad it kind of made her day and I wish that I encountered more nice people like her.  On to the salad................  Cobb Salad with Chicken-  This thing looked great right from the get go!  The salad included a mix of spring greens and iceberg lettuce, avocado, blue cheese crumbles, green onions, a ton of bacon and a nice amount of chicken.  I had ordered my salad \"mixed\" (you can order it with dressing on the side), and they used a perfect amount of dressing.  Enough to coat it, but not swimming in it.  All the items were fresh as could be!  My favorite part of the salad might have been the green onions.  They are very sneaky and you can feel the crunch and taste them but not really see them.  They were well incorporated into the mix.  The chicken was cubed up and had great texture, the bacon was incredibly plentiful, and the salad had a decent amount of blue cheese crumbles and a few slices of ripe avocado.  I mowed down that salad in no time at all!  It was great!  Overall, I am happy I discovered this place.  I foresee myself coming back very soon!  It's close to work, healthy, and not too expensive ($7.80...less if you don't add chicken).  It was a delicious lunch and I am excited for when they build the one in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Had my first salad yesterday and it was amazing! I ordered the Santa Fe and added chicken! The service was great and the salads came out fast!  Everything was fresh and didn't seem prepackaged for a reasonable price! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Salad and Go has a great variety of salads and wraps. When I first started eating here I would get the wraps, recently I switched to the salad at it seems to be much more food.   I have tried virtually all the salads and have liked all them. Both the chicken and steak are good protein add in's.  I also realty like all for their seasonal lemonades. Today's flavor was peach, mango, rosemary and it was delicious.  Quick, friendly services with good food and a good value."}
{"text":"I am not a lover of quinoa but their breakfast bowl is AMAZING it's absolutely a go to for me now!! I also love the strawberry spinach smoothie. Such great customer service every time I'm there! I tell everyone about Salad and Go!!"}
{"text":"I had gotten the seasonal lemonade. It tasted so disgusting not from the flavor but like the lemons used were old and nasty or possibly the machine being dirty. I was on my way to work so i didn't have time to bring it back right away. I came back an hour later with the lemonade and explained the situation to the cashier she was really nice and offered me another. I constantly go to salad and go so i was shocked by the unusual taste. I'm giving 5 stars being its my favorite cucmber mint lemonade spot and the fact that she so kindly handled the misshap!!  Keep up the work!"}
{"text":"Just finished my second salad from here and all I can say is wow! The ingredients are fresh, they offer an interesting variety of salads, and the prices are reasonable. If you haven't tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Salad and Go.  It's close to my work, they got the order correct, and the food was fresh.  I would go back again.   I had the Cobb with no bacon or blue cheese and ranch dressing.  It was pretty good. I'd like to try some other salads."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is a healthier alternative and you get it so quick! I love the free range chicken option. I've had the Greek, bbq and oriental salad, all delicious! And their soups are delicious too! This is a place I have no problem recommending and returning to on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Still love this place.  Just tried the Warm Berry Quinoa Breakfast Bowl... YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Great option for those of us who don't want to weigh a hundred pounds just cause we have to eat our a lot. They are very fast and the salads are big. They could use a larger dressing serving and some more options for kids and those with allergies. Overall, a good option."}
{"text":"What a massive salad! When seeking for a decently priced salad, it can sometimes get difficult. Some people are too fancy (pricey), and some others are fast food salads (bleh). Insert Salad and Go.  Again, let me state how large this salad is. I have a big appetite, but I somehow couldn't finish this one.  I ordered the Santa Fe salad. It was good, but not earth shattering - is that even possible with a salad?  Pros: besides the size, the cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing was pretty good. Not overly priced.  Cons: some of the toppings were kind of bland and tasteless.  All in all, I liked this place. I'd come back to try some of the other menu items - they have way more than just salads FYI! If you're not keen on waiting in the drive through line, I think I saw a small window around the side where you can walk up to. All in all, it took me just under 10 minutes to go from 9th in line to back on the road."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. So far I have tried the Cobb and Louie salads and both have been delicious. So happy to find this place right in my neighborhood. My kids have tried the kids meals too and they love them. I look forward to visiting many more times."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing!!! Love the menu options, the food is delicious and the service is excellent.!! Definitely the best option for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Pleasantly surprised. We ate lunch only to return for dinner. So good. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because the I have ordered 3 different drinks and hated them all.  A regular lemonade: just ok, a mango green tea: no way tasted black and I hate black tea, and a cucumber mint lemonade: hated it but I will say my husband loves that drink so prob just personal choice."}
{"text":"This is pretty far outside my normal area, but I was in Chandler visiting a friend and he suggested we get drive-thru salads. \"Is that a thing?\" I asked, skeptical. In Tucson, it's hard to find a good salad anywhere. Apparently in Gilbert, they hand them out in the drive-thru.  I used Salad and Go's website to get information on several of their salads before we drove down there, and I was SHOCKED at the size of the salad for the price. Why don't we have these in Tucson?  My greek salad was fresh, fluffy, and had no shortage of feta cheese. When given the option, I asked for my dressing tossed in, and thought it was maybe just slightly too much, but not bad. I also added chicken to my salad (they also offer steak, shrimp, and some kind of imitation meat). The chicken was okay, not great; not bad enough to take a point off of the review.  As a single person who has trouble going through lettuce before it goes bad, I really wish there was something like this near my home or work. Salad and Go serves a better salad through their drive-thru than you can get in most restaurants, and at a better price."}
{"text":"Love this place, but this was my first time to the new Scottsdale location and my sweet patato and strawberry wrap was way smaller than at other locations. Guess I should've kept it a salad."}
{"text":"Quick pick up of salad and smoothies, can't ask for a better fast food option. I tried every smoothie, every one was very good. We also had the Cobb salad, very good too. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great concept. Fast, healthy, fresh, delicious and affordable food. Salad and Go is a great addition to the area. Every salad I have ordered has been fantastic. I order the cob most often and add steak with half the dressing mixed in. I think I could eat this everyday.   The staff is so friendly and always has a smile. Just a nice place to go and grab lunch."}
{"text":"Went back last night for the second time--a totally different experience. They ran out of romaine lettuce, which was really disappointing. We ordered a sweet potato salad with steak, a breakfast smoothie, and a strawberry spinach smoothie. Well, we got the salad--no steak, and the breakfast smoothie. It was a disappointing visit, that's for sure. Ended up throwing away the salad and went to Rubio's."}
{"text":"unfortunately, I got the incorrect order and I don't live close to come back. I was really excited to place my order, but I guess I'll have to give it a try anotheryime"}
{"text":"Obsessed! So good and convenient. I got the chicken Ceaser salad wrap, chia seed parfait and the mango green iced tea. The wrap was huge and filed with fresh ingredients. The tomatoes were so ripe it made the wrap! The chia parfait was a great healthy snack. The iced tea was refreshing and a perfect addition to my meal. The service was quick. I've waited longer in Starbucks drive thru. I'm a early riser so I love that they open early! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their breakfast burrito Rasta better than anywhere else I've gotten one here in Phoenix. The salads are fresh and delicious and the cucumber mint lemonade is my new favorite drink. Well worth the price! :)"}
{"text":"For fast food it's 5 stars. Salads are good portions are huge for the price and ingredients. You pay the same if not more at chik Fila or McDonald's. We were pleased with everything we tried."}
{"text":"The Greek salad wrap I ordered was great but the service was sub par. I likely will not go back because the service was so poor. I asked for a fork and a knife and the girl working rolled her eyes and acted like it was a huge inconvenience. Then I was told they don't have knives so I asked if the wrap could be cut in half. She took my wrap and handed back without saying a word. Uh ok.....I really was in disbelief that someone would actually roll their eyes and sigh right in front of a customer for such a small little task."}
{"text":"Good portions for the price. A bit stingy with the mozzerella on the caprese, but will just pay for double cheese next time. Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't help but feel I just robbed this place. The roasted sweet potato & Wrap & Almond bacon Salad were delicious & incredibly fresh. I can believe I spent under 18 bucks here for three items. In LA, this would have easily cost 40 bucks.   The world needs more drive thru salad spots with vegan options. So, so grateful!"}
{"text":"Yum! I got the Caprese salad and it was awesome. Mozzarella and pesto yes please! It was a good price for the size. I'm a little skeptical when it comes to salads since you can go to a salad buffet for like $6 but it was definitely worth it. I was also worried the dressing was going to be too tart or but it was perfect!  It's too bad it's out of my way to come back but if I'm in Gilbert this place would be the reason why."}
{"text":"Delicious! The staff is so patient and always caters to my modifications...  You know how it is, sometimes you just don't want tomatoes! Highly recommend, thank you for the drive through revolution!    Salad & Go, if you are considering jalapeno ranch as a year-round option...YES!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by every so often as the built this place eagerly awaiting the opening. Then once it did, my office was transferred to Chandler and I thought all hope of enjoyment at Salad and Go were lost.   How ever, I luckily found myself on the north side and got to enjoy (finally) the fresh healthy drive thru options! Went for an Asian salad with chicken and green tea. You can tell this was put together fresh just for you and I loved that. Tasted great too, loved the dressing that I got on the side, tasty chicken and the green tea was perfect to wash it all down. Can't wait until CenPho or old town area gets one!"}
{"text":"I love love love salad and go! It's an amazing concept; healthy, reasonably priced, fast, and delicious. I went for the send time tonight and got the Greek salad with chicken. I loved the dressing on this one! I've also had the BBQ salad and was very impressed! The salads are a lot bigger than I expected and very filling. Their drinks are awesome. As well. The teas are yummy and the lemonade tastes fresh and homemade!! Also the staff are awesome. Always friendly and nice. So excited to have this location in uptown"}
{"text":"The concept is good and sometimes the salads are perfect but after this last visit, I decided to write a bad review - hoping that someone would read it and changes would be made....  1. 4 out of 5 orders are wrong! Today I ordered and PAID for avocado and did not get any. This is not the first time. It was so bad that I used to check my order before pulling away because it was always wrong.  2. The steak is DISGUSTING! I am not sure what animal (Wilderbeast) you cut this from but PLEASE STOP!   My salad today, missing the avocado, steak that caused me to violently gag on and the mushy tomatoes that I had to spit out caused me to write this review and avoid this place from now on."}
{"text":"Got lunch here the other day. It's pretty good. Got the seasonal antipasto salad that was pretty good, didn't feel the dressing went well with it. The green tea wasn't the best but not horrendous."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the idea of a healthy, but quick meal. The owner was so friendly, and chatted with all the tables sitting outside eating their meals. You can tell he really cares what the customers think. You HAVE to try the orange cream milkshake, it was absolutely amazing.  I will be going back again for on my lunch breaks, or even for a light dinner :)"}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time today and it was delicious..fresh and great ingredients. Unlike fast food chains that serve salads with some pieces of lettuce here and there Salad and go has great quality..and good portion..my husband and I got 2 salads to try ..the BBQ ranch with chicken and caesar salad with chicken (with poblano dressing) ..they were both great choices the caesar with the poblano dressing had a lighter taste and it's lighter in carb if your watching carb intake.. overall we will definitely be going back..glad they opened on this side of town."}
{"text":"Love their bbq ranch salad with the marinated steak! It's super filling and keeps you full! The kids meals are awesome my son loves the turkey and cheese and the turkey cucumber pinwheels! This is a great place to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"The associates there were very kind and they helped me pick out a good salad which was delicious. I would definitely go back there again when I am in the mood for salad."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. For the price you get a lot of toppings but this time around it was different. Hardly any toppings and wasn't tossed well. Staff are super friendly but I'm disappointed with my salad."}
{"text":"Love Salad and Go, always super fresh, healthy and delicious. And Fast! Also staff very courteous and friendly. Also looking forward to checking out Meals and Go as well! We drive through Salad and Go location at Gilbert and Guadalupe frequently, love the Santa Fe salad with lime cilantro vinaigrette. Also yesterday tried the Mediterranean pasta salad, husband and I split one, both of us thought it was great. Breakfast and soups also good. Looking forward to new location promised soon near Power and Broadway, everybody in our Broadway East medical building will keep them BUSY!!! Hope it is COMING SOON!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!! Not only is it cheap, convenient, healthy and fast, but it's so freaking delicious!!! I'm serious. The drive-through is so convenient and you're out of there in record time. I've had about four of their different salads and have enjoyed each one. My pregnant friend has had about four of their wraps and she's been completely satisfied. I'll def keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love that there's a healthy, fast option when you're on the go! Their smoothies, parfaits, and wraps are good. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was okay, I really like the creek salad.. it was good and they give you a good amount."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! It's great when you are on the go & don't have time to make lunch or dinner & still trying to maintain a healthy diet. I love how they have a drive thru. I had a BBQ chicken ranch wrap. It was huge!! Also so fresh. The service was great. I had my dog in the backseat & the guy at the window gave him a treat. Healthy & pet friendly? WOO HOO! I can't wait to go back & try more menu items. This place is fabulous!!! Just what this area needed! Thanks Salad to Go!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots - great for a healthy & quick meal. Also love that they have a healthy kids menu."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and everything I have tried is really good. I love that I can get a healthy meal in a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Excellent salads with the option to have the salad dressing mixed in, but never never soggy, perfect amount. They use healthy greens instead of iceberg. Love that it is convenient like fast food but healthy. Definitely a place I will be frequenting often."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it first opened but last few times has not been good.  The amount of ingredients they add to a salad has been decreasing.  Ordered a chicken wrap and they forgot the chicken so they gave me a credit for protein on my next order. Went there last night and they forgot the chicken again!  Plus the size of the salad wrap was half the size it used to be.  I think I'm done with this location, which is too bad as they started out good."}
{"text":"Salad and Go is 100% worth the 20 min drive I have to take to get to the nearest location. No other drive thru offers healthy meals and kids meals with organic ingredients and the prices are great! So far I've tried the Greek Wrap, spinach breakfast wrap and the organic iced coffee and all are delicious. And my kids eat every bite of their protein boxes which I'm much more satisfied with than having them eat nuggets and French fries from other places. I can't wait until you guys have more locations!"}
{"text":"Went and grabbed dinner around 4:30. The drive-through was only a few cars in, but still went to the walk-up counter instead. I had the Spinach Bacon salad and my daughter had the BBQ. We had our order in about 5 minutes after ordering.  Unfortunately they forgot the avocados on the BBQ salad. The portions were decent sized, I wasn't stuffed after eating, but was satisfied. I will definitely give their other salads a try.  I see from other reviews they have been running out of product and messing up orders. I would say since they have only been open a couple of weeks to give it another chance. Opening a new business is always a little bumpy. Hopefully they will be reading these reviews so they can correct some of these issues."}
{"text":"Their name says salad but I think the hidden gem in this restaurant is their amazing breakfasts!  For $4-5, you get a thoughtful, healthy, fresh entree that will fill you up and keep you going for the morning.    My faves are: **Peanut Butter Power Wrap on honey wheat (pb, strawberries, bananas, freshly made granola, and honey) **Breakfast Wrap on honey wheat (roasted red potatoes, egg whites, spinach, pico de gallo, avocado, cheese--and I ask for no bacon) ...and I'm SO not a breakfast burrito person but trust me, these ones are GOOD!  I've also tried the Warm Berry Quinoa Bowl, which I liked (but was just a bit too dry for me though--I'm more a fan of the ones made by The Uprooted Kitchen).  Oh, and for the record, their salads are great too!  ;)"}
{"text":"Recently found this magical place I am new to the healthy life and this was faster than McDonald's cheaper then fast food and taste even better. Customer for life."}
{"text":"This place is good. I like their salads, wraps and their apple juice is super good. Their soup is good but needs more salt or something. But their smoothies aren't good. Maybe I'm too used to Jamba Juice but it's too natural or something for me and I just can't do it lol! I also think their pricing is too high. Other than that always good and they are super quick."}
{"text":"So good! Just picked up a chicken Caesar salad wrap and a southwest Caesar wrap. Delicious. And great portion size too. Very fresh."}
{"text":"Looking for something different, This was at the top of the list on Yelp. I totally enjoyed the chicken corn chowder and may come back and get some more before getting on the road. It was so delicious. We bought a salad but was filled up on the soup. Hubby enjoyed his 3 bean vegetable chili. The kale & banana smoothie was very healthy tasting so I may try the strawberry & spinach next time. It was a pleasant first time experience."}
{"text":"Cobb salad is delicious! I will be back to try the others. Store was clean, people super friendly and food is fresh."}
{"text":"Salad and Go fills a huge gap - food that is fast AND cheap AND healthy. I'm not saying  there are no options that check all those marks, just that the overlap in that Venn diagram is very small.   I was skeptical about the timing, but we arrived at the small building right before the lunch rush on a weekday. There is no dining room, but you can walk up and order, or drive through.  Very fresh and creative options, everything made in house.   I ordered 4 salads for my friends and family - 4 different ones, and we were out of the busy drive through line, paid and salads in hand, within 5 minutes.   The salads were all delicious - I was sure to try them all. Some classic flavor pairing - some OG combos - the greens very fresh and no weird bagged salad funk."}
{"text":"I've only been once. Today for lunch. But how much can ingredients really change (or improve) from one visit to the next? I'd probably still go back to try something different, but my review for now was Meh. In my opinion, if you are all fresh ingredients and the only meat you serve is added to improve the salad, it should be good, right?? I ordered the Asian Salad with chicken. Not only was there VERY little chicken, (Not even close to enough to accompany the salad) the quality and taste was analogous to any fast food restaurant that prepares a salad. That's NOT a compliment. (Sorry Wendy's) The lettuce and ingredients were tasty and fresh but overall, it was still just an overpriced fast food style salad. I'd rather just do a take out order from a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food restaurant. Great salads and soups and drinks plus they have smoothies. I usually order the cobb salad, but I've also had the BBQ and some seasonal menu stuff. They will let you change the lettuce blend and modify any of the items. You can also choose a dressing and have it mixed in or on the side.  They serve several teas, including green tea and Bergie's coffee. I stopped there for breakfast before and really enjoyed it. I eat gluten-free only so it's nice to find a place that has healthy food and I can eat almost everything on the menu. I noticed that they also mark items that are dairy-free and other allergens. I sure wish there were more of these in the area, but I'm lucky because this one's close to my house."}
{"text":"I love this place! Just found it last week. Gluten free options, fresh ingredients, great prices!  I have had the BBQ salad with chicken, the strawberry sweet potatoes with shrimp, corn chowder, wild rice soup, Cobb salad, and lemonade's. So good!  They have a lot of customization available like getting a blend of lettuces, or mixing the tea and lemonade. Plus they have green tea!  My new favorite restaurant for fast food!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at salad and go. Eating healthy isn't usually my thing but it doesn't feel like a chore here, it's delicious tbh"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, fast, healthy! Oh... They have a drive-thru, too! Really good salads and delicious mango green iced tea! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I love this place they are super fast & everything is really good. The apples in the apple & greens salad seem to always be old like they've been left out. I've gotten this salad three times & each time the apples weren't good. Other than that I really like this place."}
{"text":"Love the Cobb salad, everyone is always friendly. Way better then  greasy fast food."}
{"text":"Great salads.  My husband had the BBQ ranch salad with chicken and loved it. I had the Cobb with ranch and balsamic dressing. Both were awesome."}
{"text":"I had been debating on trying this place and I'm so mad I waited so long!  Delicious, fresh, great prices, great service.  I will have to try to stay away now."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch! Some of my favorite features are: -food is always fresh  -a huge wrap is the same price as a huge salad -they are willing to alter anything on your order -you can get the dressing on it, on the side, or both -super quick and packaged to go for walk up or drive through"}
{"text":"Raising the bar! Let's talk lunch/dinner and BREAKFAST. Lunch/dinner:  Cobb Salad.  We've all had fair salads.  That's not the case here!   Fresh lettuce that's cut in bite size pieces.  Real hardboiled egg. Not the fermented precooked egg that tastes funny.   Real bacon. Not packaged.   And yes!  You can save yourself the mess and ask to have the salad dressing tossed in the salad. I also like to ask for 'easy on the dressing.'  I like just enough for flavor.   BREAKFAST! My new obsession.  For the last 2 weeks I've been getting the traditional bowl.  Eggs, bacon, potatoes, salsa on the side to drizzle on top. Today!  Sad they didn't have eggs until their truck delivered and although bummed she recommended the quinoa bowl. Skeptical I tried it.  WoW.  Blueberries. Bananas. Coconut flakes. Almond slivers. Strawberries. And a dolup of peanut butter.  Between the cold toppings and the other flavors. YUM.   Now not for the carb avoiders/keto due to the carbs.  But if not on the trend it's filled with good carbs and very yummy.  They now have me for lunch/dinner AND breakfast. Ps. Their soup at this location is nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"Wow... wasn't expecting this.   I try to eat healthy and decided to try for lunch today.  To be honest I was apprehensive, Salas to go, really?   Well I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised.   Ordered a salad at the window with an ice tea.  It was ready in less thank 5 minutes and I ate on the outside seating.   First thing I noticed was the salad was very chilled, not warm.   The lettuce was fresh and crisp and everything was tasty and a plenty big salad.  This is a place I will come to again for sure.  Don't let the walk up and walk away scare you, it was quite good."}
{"text":"We had the Santa Fe which was very good in both size and flavor.  Don't use Cotija Cheese on salads when we make them, but worked on this one.   The Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette added a nice little kick, but not overpowering and complimentary to the other ingredients .  Salad was fresh and did not see anything that looked like it had been sitting out in our salad.  They did have a small chalk board menu by the larger main board that appears to be seasonal salad/other items that do not show up on their website's menu list.  They had down a clam chowder which would be nice on these cooler...for Arizona days and a pear and cranberry salad we almost got which looks to be a seasonal salad?  Noticed they did have a kid's menu which is probably a tougher sell for kids today, but the 4 or so choices I saw on their site did have a variety between them to hopefully find something they will like.  Overall for our first visit the service was fast, the food was good, nice salad selections and the price was very reasonable compared to the other less healthy choices around here.  Look forward to trying some of their other items and maybe a wrap to see if I can eat a salad in the car:)"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch with my husband and was surprised. Food was fast and fresh. Loved the options and the prices. I got the strawberry sweet potato salad and my hubby got a cob wrap. Both delicious. They have all the nutrition info posted which is great"}
{"text":"Ordered a Santa Fe salad and a Caesar wrap. Both were delicious, filling, and inexpensive. And the service was exceptionally speedy! Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Only had 30 minutes between classes at the Arizona School of Real Estate, so decided to give this place a try since it was so close.  WOW!  I am so happy I did!  It is so hard to find healthy, organic fast food, but the salads here are simply off the charts.  I do not typically eat any fast food.  I'm not looking forward to my last RE class...I'll have to find a Salad and Go in east Mesa!  PS...portions are large (typically 2 meals for me), and I've found the employees are eager to help with suggestions, changes or substitutions.  Have only tried the Southwest and Greek salads, but can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  WINNER!!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken is supper dry and bland. They charge about $8 per salad without a drink (ripoff). Your better off going to McDonald's and buying a salad for half the price."}
{"text":"So glad that this place is in the neighborhood, it makes eating healthier a lot more convenient. Some of the salad choices might seem like odd combinations yet somehow they work and always satisfy the taste buds. If you do give one of their salads a try definite add a smoothie for your drink, you can tell the ingredients used are all fresh and it will definitely quench your thirst. Overall it's a great convenient drive thru where you can do as the name says, salad and go."}
{"text":"Salad and go has been my  frequent drive thru for drinks or salads . I've almost had every salad on the menu and they won't disappoint . The Santa Fe and the Greek are my two favorites . Only complaint is I don't care for the chicken. I wish it was grilled or prepared by them . The chicken seemed like it was pre-bought and cut in to cubes . I'm very picky so it may not bother anyone . On the positive note : the salads always freshly made to order and the dressings are out of this world ."}
{"text":"2nd time here, both have been very disappointing, first time I came tried the Greek salad and a soup, this time tried 2 different soups, including the new seasonal one which had 0 zucchini what a let down, the pics on Facebook looks great but the food is horrible"}
{"text":"I am so thankful and so in love with this place! I've been on the autoimmune paleo protocol and it's been impossible to eat out anywhere, especially fast food. I am now driving all the way from west Mesa, once a week, to grab lunch here. I love the Sweet Potato and Strawberry salad with chicken, and avocado instead of quinoa. Yum! The portion is big, service is quick, and everything tastes fresh. I like that they make it easy to make substitutions and will read you ingredient lists. Next time I go, I need to see if I can have any of the salad dressings (have just been having naked salads so far). I almost got the basalmic vinaigrette today, but I don't eat rice bran oil."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time, on a 108 degree afternoon. Had the Asian salad. What a pleasure. Fresh greens, snappy green pea pods. Added the shrimp, they were cooked properly and tasted fresh. Drove through, window service was friendly, and they got the order right. I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Your in and out and get a giant salad for so cheap! The quality and freshness is amazing. I drive well out of the way to get food from here! So good!"}
{"text":"This place is great! They are always fast and have delicious fresh salads. It's so nice to have a healthy fast food place!"}
{"text":"So far our family loves this place. We've only tried the seasonal apple pecan salad, asian salad, cobb and cesear but they've all been great. The ingredients are all very fresh and each salad sounds amazing so I'm sure we'll try them all.  I've been pleasantly surprised with the speed of the service each time we've been here. We also customized the salads a few times and the orders were right each time.   Lastly, these salads are actually pretty big. Usually when someone tells me they can't eat their whole salad I assume they don't eat very much, but I'd believe it with these. You could easily pay $10 for a salad half this size at a restaurant.   My only compliant is I'd love if they had hot coffee all day."}
{"text":"I just can't quit this place.  No matter the size of the wrap, the flavors are perfection. Sigh...I'll be back. Please make the wraps the size they were though. I MISS coming here to get dinner and being full long after..."}
{"text":"So my very first time trying Salad and go. I opted for the Cesar's salad with chicken. I have been hesitant to stop here because a drive thru for salad in my mind I'm thinking what will you end up with. Well I ended up with a salad that's pretty big, everything seemed fresh and crisp, my only complaint is I wish I had asked for another dressing the size of the salad and the amount of dressing I feel was not enough. The price is pretty good and it was quick and the service was good. The girl at the window was pleasant and I would definitely go back. It was filling and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Super fast and convenient and a HEALTHY drive thru! Kinda pricey but healthy food usually is I suppose. Highly recommend the mango  smoothie that was really good!"}
{"text":"Finally came to Phoenix and I am Loving it. Friends and family in Chandler,Gilbert and Mesa always said how great the salads are and now I have one near my work!  If I can just have one open near my home! Everything I have tried so far has been so good and fresh.  From the roasted sweet potato & strawberry salad to the Chia seed parfait, and great prices. Fast & Easy drive thru."}
{"text":"I go to this place more than I should admit but lately I noticed that whenever I order a wrap they always give me the wrong protein.  The salad you can check but the last two/ three times I ordered steak and was given chicken.  I 'll just order a salad and wrap it at home or just make the entire thing at home  the cucumber mint lemonade is yummy.  There is always a long line but they move quickly."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday for the first time. I ordered the bbq chicken wrap. It was excellent and big enough for my daughter and I to split. Ill definitely be back to try something else. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Quick, fresh, healthy, large portions, very reasonably priced.  If they put this on every corner of America rather than nasty fast food the world would be a better place.  Wish they would put one on my corner!"}
{"text":"Greek salad with steak was filling and very satisfying.  Large bowl of fresh greens, crisp, clean Vegs and delicious dressing.  Will return to try other salad combinations.  People taking the order have been helpful, upbeat and courteous.  Great value!"}
{"text":"Came in during the lunch peak hour and the drive-in line was substantially long but that didn't matter because the staff was fast and handled the rush very well. In a matter of minutes I had my salad and was very content.  Can't get any better than fresh ingredients, a professional and friendly staff combined with fast and accurate service."}
{"text":"A healthy drive thru with delicious salads and wraps! It's a little pricy but to me it's worth for the convenience."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I've been coming here for a few years now and I have never had anything that wasn't spectacular. My favorite salad is the Cobb with either chicken or steak. The homemade soup is so flavorful and the staff members are incredibly friendly. I can't believe what a large salad you can get for such a low price. I work in East Mesa so I can go here during the week however, there have been times that even on the weekend I have made the trek from Tempe just for the food here. Looking forward to one opening in Tempe someday!!"}
{"text":"So, I'm pretty obsessed with this place. I'm a salad lover by nature but I usually don't enjoy salads from restaurants, I always have to make it myself if I want it done right. WELL this place has given me a chance to be a little lazy!!! I've gone probably 9 times now. Or it could be much more I lost count. The wait is never long and the food is always fresh. I take my dogs with me and they love the showering of compliments from the window followed by a little treat! The employees have always been super friendly.   My FAVORITE is the Caprese salad with chicken. I literally dream about it. I went for breakfast for the first time today and had the breakfast bowl and that was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great place for quick healthy lunch. Cobb is great. Also like their Asian salad. One day I'll try a wrap or smoothie. Nice to have healthy quick options."}
{"text":"Huge salads, steak isn't dry, very delicious! I love the soda options. The Caprese salad is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Sent hubby for takeout so I can't comment on the customer service experience at the actual restaurant. Wasn't a big fan of my antipasto salad. Portion was decent but the mozzarella cheese came in huge hunks and had a weird texture and flavor. The salami also had a strange flavor. The artichokes had a lot of hard leaves that I couldn't even chew. Definitely didn't feel like love or care was put into this salad. More like all the components were just dumped from larger cans/bins and just thrown together to make a salad. My husband's southwest caesar was better than mine but also wasn't amazing.  I'd give this place one more shot because I love the concept of a healthy drive thru option. As of right now, I'm not impressed or dying to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely going back! Loved everything, and it was great that they offer a meat substitute!!! I only wish it was closer to me so I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"...Caca.....tell u why....the food not to fresh. The salad teast a little funky after putting dressing on .... Guy tells my i don't smell any thing. I said teast it.... Nope.....I tell him ,the ranch dressing is bad. He gaves me a new ranch...hahaha!.. Fkn guy! Amazing!... Salad, in the trash.... Money wasted."}
{"text":"Rude from start to finish. If that drive thru girl is that rough maybe a position that doesn't involve customer interaction.   I love Salad And Go but I will never come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Best fast food idea ever! I had the sweet potato strawberry quinoa and goat cheese salad and a green smoothie. So delicious! I can't wait to go back! High quality gourmet salads to go. Brilliant. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great alternative to every other fast food restaurant...the salads here are 10 times better than the salads at other fast food places and they have yummy smoothies and coffee! Getting your salad as a wrap is also delish and they're good size!"}
{"text":"The staff who took our order was very helpful. It was our first time and my BF was about to order a wrap and a salad. She was right that both would be too much, so we got him a wrap with a double helping of chicken (for the meat-loving carnivore !) He LOVED it !!! It was nice and hefty; he says he reminded him of a burrito, but better and lighter (sans rice and beans).  I had the Cobb salad, subbing blue cheese with mozzarella and the blue cheese dressing for poblano Caesar (Caesar kicked up a notch :-) They used the perfect amount of dressing, not too rich nor too dry. It had s generous helping of bacon bits. The chicken add-on was about the size of a chicken tender, so it was about enough for me (I was glad we made his a double.) I love the poblano Caesar dressing !  Whoever critiqued their chicken add-on...Salad and Go must have heard the comment, because my chicken was well seasoned. I can see the cracked pepper. I almost went with steak because of that comment, but chicken goes better with a Cobb salad, and the chicken breast cubes  were tasty (coming from an Asian who normally prefers dark meat.)  We're here for a few days, and it's looking like this is our new favorite dinner choice. Better than Sweet Tomatoes, where we tend to over-eat, especially on the carbs.   We're definitely coming back, maybe as soon as tomorrow. Already have our next order planned. He'll get a wrap sans extras, along with a peanut buttery smoothie.  If this chain is not already in CA, PLEASE consider opening up some shops !!!!! These beat the store-bought ready-to-eat salads any day !"}
{"text":"STILL the best. Cool staff, FABULOUS wraps and salads. I used to get the salads, but my BF turned me into the wraps (honey wheat is perfect, healthier but sweet enough to make the \"healthy\" taste good !! We are super lucky to have this within walking distance."}
{"text":"Update: Still DELICIOUS. Decided to try out their breakfast this morning and it didn't disappoint. I had the peanut butter power wrap. A pretty basic idea that I remember having as a kid, but it's still yummy and a great quick breakfast. I was in the drive thru at 7 AM and I asked if I could order a salad, LOL. Of course they said \"Yes\" so I got one for lunch!   Have I mentioned I love this place?!  A suggestion for Salad N Go: Start a punch card system."}
