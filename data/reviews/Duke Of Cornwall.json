{"text":"Having seen the construction of this new pub for months, I was super excited to have a new local for an after work drink or quick bite to eat.  I dropped by on their second day with some friends, and we were promptly seated by the host. The tables are spacious and there are lots of TVs, great during game night.   The food menu was extensive and I ordered some wings and fries. My friends ordered from the sharing menu (dry ribs, mini burger and calamari). The food arrived quickly and was reasonably good for pub food, but definitely nothing to write home about.  I was a little disappointed to see that there were no food or drink special offers, such as you would expect to see in a chain pub. If this was the case I would happily drop by on a frequent basis, but for now it's a little on the expensive side if I'm honest.   Hopefully they will refine their pricing over time and offer food/drink specials to entice customers."}
{"text":"A much needed pub in this neck of the woods.  They just opened last week, and so far so good.    Glad to finally see the COMING SOON sign off as it's been under construction for the last while.  Staff was super friendly, and the menu is fairly traditional pub fare.  Got the meatloaf, which I'm not sure when the last time I've ordered one from a restaurant.  It was good, and nicely restaurantified (c).  Will be back to check out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Came across this pub by chance and it turned out out to be our lucky day. The restaurant is cleaned! The service was friendly and the food was to die for."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at the Duke of Cornwall.  It just opened about three months ago.  I ordered chicken wings (medium) and fries with Ranch sauce.  They were good.  Erin was the server/bartender.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Been here twice already. Once for dinner and once for drinks. For dinner I had the beef pie. Was delicious. Would have it again. I asked for extra gravy for the pudding and it was delicious.  For drinks, the service wasn't as great as dinner service. I had asked for a virgin cocktail but they gave me alcohol instead. Waitress was also not as attentive. Would love to see a yelp check in special. Hoping this place sticks around. Food looks great. Will likely be in tonight for the raptors game."}
{"text":"Awesome that a much needed sports bar has opened in a growing residential neighbourhood. Great staff that will really take care of you, but they need to check their hours on local game nights. During raptors and leafs playoffs game, they've called last call before 10 and WELL before the game is done. Game 4 of the leafs/Boston game they stopped serving in the second period. A few weeks before they stopped serving during a raptors game at 8pm. Most bars in the core that show games close at midnight when games are on, so there are options... but really, wouldn't you rather go to the one close to home?"}
{"text":"Would come here only if I worked in the building. No daily specials, no cheap drinks, no entertainment, no live music? 2 star food? I wanted this place to do well, I really did. But there's just no incentive to come here-and I'm a local too! Look, there's Village Idiot and Sin and Redemption (wicked and perhaps over 50+ types of beers), there's Queen Mother (Ping Gai OMG!), all those pubs along John Street (Office Pub, Town Crier, even JackAsters for Chris sake!). Why should I come here? Sorry but it's true. Tried it once and will probably never again. Come on, zero specials? No wonder this place is DEAD on a Saturday night...Begging people to come in on St Patrick's Day with their flags. Yikes, I give this place no more than a year. Here's a tip for management, lower your prices, make better food, and get some live music. Good luck!"}
{"text":"We recently saw that this place had opened on Wednesday and contacted the GM, Spiros asking if he could accommodate a group of about 30 people. Without hesitation, he showed us a section in the restaurant which he had reserved for us the next day.   First off, this pub looks fantastic and has a comfortable feel but yet looks tasteful decorated and modern. The beer taps at the bar have this really cool contraption that has them attached to the ceiling rather than down at the bar ....go check it out. It's really neat.   While the drinks are priced at a 'premium' rate, the food and service were EXCELLENT. This isn't a pretentious place by any means, the staff is friendly, professional and quite accommodating.   I tried the calamari, wings, popcorn shrimp and some fries. A friend who had the Duke burger said it was good. I think the only thing that was 'ok' and not really worth getting was the dry short ribs.  Other than that, we were really happy with this place! Definitely going back again!"}
