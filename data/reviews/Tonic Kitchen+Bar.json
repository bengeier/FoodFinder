{"text":"Ambiance bar, le cadre est plutot sympathique ! Les plats sont bons et le personnel est super accueillant."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food is okay. I came around 10:30 in the morning here and nobody was there to seat you while you can see the waitress lady chatting with kitchen staff. Ordered for a pancake waiting for it for 30 mins."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place as I liked the hotel vibe. Server was friendly and well polished. The restaurant was empty as it was mid afternoon. I ordered French onion soup and the chicken Parmesan sandwich. The food quality was mediocre, the groceries on the sammy weren't the freshest. The soup tasted like balsamic vinegar which I didn't enjoy. My friend got the beef dip which was okay. Coffee wasn't the best as we went to Tim Hortons afterwards. No real complaints but nothing to write home about. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Tonic is a great hotel restaurant. Great food and amazing staff! The area is still developing near at the airport But with their happy hour and daily specials you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"I was going to order something more substantial until I read Yelp review, thought I'd play it safe with French Onion soup and Caesar salad. Pretty underwhelming, \"careful bowl is hot!\"   Not really, cuz the soup is tepid."}
{"text":"We live not far from here and they have been advertising hard in the area.  We gave it a shot.  The wife ordered the chicken parm sandwich and loved it,  I had the steak sandwich - I've had better & I've  had alot worse as well.  The food was decent and the beer is cold, service was quick with Anthony.  The place feels cold and like a hotel restaurant, if I get that feeling I'd like to be somewhere warm instead! Probably come back one day!"}
{"text":"I think I tasted my least favourite burger ever here! We ordered their \"signature item\" the \"Tonic Burger\" and were really unimpressed. It didn't taste good at all and the fries were tasteless. Definitely not worth the $18.00.   The gentleman who was working there was extremely pleasant though!"}
{"text":"Flanked by two great hotels stands the weakest link between them.  The Tonic Kitchen+Bar. I have been to the Applause Hotel for couple of times.  I really enjoy the hotel, but the restaurant needs to up their game. The first time I was here, I ended up with a cold chunk of meatloaf and I chalked it up to arriving late. This time, I was here on prime time dinner hour and they butchered the first attempted at medium NY Strip!  The bartender took it back and had another one made. This time, it was not overcooked, however, I think I got the toughest piece of leather that I have ever been served.  Let me tell you something, I know my STEAK!  And I think I got a piece of revenge meat from the chef!  There was nothing redeeming about the re-fired steak.  It was tough, tough, tough!  It even had those Ponderosa diamond grill marks.  Finished half of it and gave up.  When spending $30 for a chunk of beef, there should be something to enjoy. Now...it validates the fact that the first time I was here and the meatloaf was frozen, it was not me arriving late, it is just the food quality of the place. I rated the hotel 5 stars and I still would rate it 5 - however, I still need to dine when I travel and now that I know I can't eat at their restaurant, I will need to stay elsewhere!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"}
