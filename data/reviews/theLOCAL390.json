{"text":"I've been coming to the local390 for a couple of years now for the pizza. They make excellent pie! I personally enjoy the Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. It's usually pretty quiet over the lunch hour, so it's nice for a small group without having to yell. There are a couple of VLTs if you're in to that."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town by far Thursday 25% off so it's a steal of a deal and a deal on jugs too.. Great customer service it's a must stop for my days off mmmmmm pizzzza beer"}
{"text":"First time visit. Casual pub and nothing fancy. Had a peach cider and original burger and fries. Good prices for good food! Will be back."}
{"text":"It's a local dive bar with a couple TV screens.  Tried the pizza.  Picked the Tourist pizza.   It was OK but not great.  Found it too salty (likely the feta), could barely taste the tomato sauce, and could barely taste the pepperoni.  Needs zestier sauce and pepperoni.  Tasted like a ham pizza.  But it had a lot of toppings."}
{"text":"This bar is simple, clean, reasonably priced and you can tell the owner strives to make his patrons happy.
We had heard about the pizza being amazing from on-line reviews so we opted to try it out and we were not disappointed. Best Pizza in Calgary in my opinion, hands down. The crust is homemade, perfectly chewy and crispy, the sauce was zippy, cheese was perfectly stringy and the toppings were fresh. #18, the Chef's pizza was our choice of the night and I wish we had ordered another small to go.

This is a neighbourhood pub tucked into a strip mall where eventually everyone would know your name if you were a regular. Rich did a great job bartending and staying on top of service as well. It was not crazy busy but this place has potential!

 I loved the digital juke box on the wall where for a couple of bucks you could listen to almost any song you wanted by any artist.
I also loved the cozy atmosphere with the candles on each table giving the place some mood.
Washroom clean - bonus!
Again - the pricing - $4 for a pint of local brew - you  cannot beat that and the temperature was right on. $4.50 or so for a mixed drink. $11 for a small pizza I shall not soon forget!"}
