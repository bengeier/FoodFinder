{"text":"Best spot if your just running in for a slice and not much time on your hands. Simple, easy and delicious. They don't have many options in terms of topping (margherita,pepperoni and maybe one other) but it really doesn't matter because it's really well made pizza. They add sesame seeds to the crust which is a nice little addition. Perfect place for a quick, relatively cheap slice when you don't feel like shelling out that extra money for Libretto or the other fancier places. it also ranks far above other chain-pizza restaurants attempting to appear authentic *cough* pizzaiola *cough*. Oh ya you can also take an Instagram pic of their sign outside, seems like a thing people are doing these days HA!"}
{"text":"Way better than most by-the-slice pizza joints around town. It completely blows Pizzaiolo, etc. out of the water. 

I ordered a huge margherita slice for $4.40. Great fresh tasting tomato sauce and decent cheese, although it was pretty light on the basil. The crust wasn't fantastic, but I'm guessing it's much tastier right out of the oven. The dough had a nice flavour, a bit on the salty side, but the texture was too tough. Then again, it was completely dead in there on a 35 degree Tuesday afternoon. Maybe it had been sitting for longer than usual.

Decent low-key decor and comfortable atmosphere. Looking forward to ordering a full one next time I'm with a friend to see how it differs fresh."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay and the salad was bleh.  But it was the service and'tude that were the most unappetizing.  When I called to order (on a busy night, I guess) the guy who answered the phone just kind of scoffed and said, \"only if you want to wait for over an hour and a half\".  I was actually okay with the timing, so i went ahead.  But when the delivery guy got here, i ended up standing at the door for almost 15 minutes as he repeatedly tried to process my visa through an iPhone app, which repeatedly didn't work. In the end, he wasn't sure if it went through or not.  He told me that this happens all the time, but the owners won't invest in a proper credit card unit.  I told him I was done standing at the door and to get the restaurant to confirm the status and take my payment over the phone, if necessary.   I then got an immediate hostile call from the charmer i had spoken to earlier, who accused me of trying to not pay and then went on to lecture me about \"how we do things\".  Yuck."}
{"text":"I've dropped in for slices a couple of times and that's been fine. Tonight I ordered delivery to my house ... nduja, garlic, and olives on the margherita (I believe). 

So no word of a lie, I hang up on North of Brooklyn and then get on a call with Fido to fix something. My pizza arrives while I'm still waiting on hold for a Fido rep.

North of Brooklyn: 1, Fido: 0

Pizza toppings and cheese are high quality & delicious. The crust is good, not as fine as a Libretto pizza but not the cardboard like you get at P.P. and other ghetto pizza joints. 

Plus, it was delivered by a very nice guy on a bike in the pouring rain--and it was very hot and fresh. I salute them!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzeria in Toronto. ..I just tried the Cheese pizza but I love it, so tasty."}
{"text":"Have never made a review, but after this experience and the state of hunger I'm in I had too. Ordered a pizza and garlic knots around 12:45pm and received it at 2:30pm due to an unexpected delay from the driver. Food was cold and we are currently warming it up in the oven. Got 50% off though, however never ordering this again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. My wife and I shared a large pepperoni...pretty easily actually. The pizza is really thin (a good thing) so be prepared to get at least 2 slices unless you only want a snack. It was pretty tasty though. As were the garlic twists. Recommended.

As far as the complaints about the staff...the staff was super friendly to both my wife and I. No attitude or issues whatsoever.  Don't be put off by other complaints on here."}
{"text":"This place has been in the back of my mind to try for about 8 months now and last week, on one of the coldest days, the boyfriend and me decided to take a walk over. I much prefer thin crust pizza over regular crust, so this place is perfect for me. We went for the classic margherita pizza and were pleasantly surprised by how big it was. Despite that, we ate the whole pizza in 4 minutes flat. I think that says it all. It reminds me of Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, which is never a bad thing."}
{"text":"Margarita pizza was AMAZING! The thin crust was so good! I can't wait to go back for more! 
I think the store front needs to be advertised a little more. It's quite easy to miss the store, and looks closed from a distance. I'll definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome NYC style pizza. Plain and simple. Go for the pepperoni, fkn awesome. 

If you're vegan, gluten sensitive, health conscious or like more exotic pies, this place isn't for you. 

- char
- crispy
- thin
- perfect amount of cheese
- spicy pepperoni
- fresh tomato sauce

Simple and perfect."}
{"text":"We ordered a whole marguarita pie.   The other half finished his slice and declared, \"tastes like saucy cardboard.\"    I had to agree.   :(

Downtown Toronto has a severe lack of decent plzza places, and I am afraid NoB just doesn't cut it.

Perhaps its the Church Street location only.   Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price!North of Brooklyn pizzeria serves authentic Neapolitan Pizza.The tomato sauce is fragrant and oh so delicious!The basil  is blended With the San Marzano Tomatoes. You can buy the pizza by the slice it a whole one.They even deliver!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but unreliable service. Last 3 times I tried ordering I ended up empty handed. Have given up on trying even though food is good. I wish the staff and business did more to accommodate demand."}
{"text":"Adding to review below,  after getting the pizza 2 hours late,  it turned out to just be ok :("}
{"text":"Pizza is decent though no better than upscale chains like pizzaiolo. The guys who work there seem to think its appropriate to blast filthy, misogynistic rap music when there are kids in the place.  Very nice. You guys are the coolest pizza cooks in town."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had.  Each time I have I slice of North of Brooklyn pizza, it is better than the last time I had one.  The tomato/pizza sauce is to die for and I can no longer eat from the unnamed pizza franchises near my condo at front & spadina.......! definitely will be a regular at North of Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"North of Brooklyn brings something to Toronto that's been really lacking - delicious pizza sold by the slice. There aren't very many options in the city if you're looking for a pizza joint that doesn't go by the name \"Pizza Pizza.\"

What went in my belly:

Margherita Slice - While the crust was just so-so (granted, it's not the same when the pizza isn't fresh out of the oven), it was topped with a fresh and delicious tomato sauce. It's a simple pizza that really lets the fresh ingredients shine. Simple but damn good!

White Slice - I rarely order white pizzas since I love tomato sauce but this was surprisingly delicious. The white pizza consisted of garlic, ricotta and was topped with some lightly dressed arugula which was placed on the pizza after it was warmed up. The dressing had a subtle lemon dressing which gave it a nice freshness. I loved every bite!

Nduja Slice (one of the specials of the day) - It consisted of nduja sausage, basil and a fresh arugula topping like the white slice. Again, it was another delicious slice of pizza! However, my favourite goes to the white slice.

A great place to grab pizza by the slice!"}
{"text":"This spot is the perfect place to grab a delicious, inexpensive slice when you're on the go.  Dining in is super casual and you can usually get some pretty delightful banter going with the guys behind the counter.  The crust is perfect, each sauce is delicious, and there's not so much cheese that you leave feeling guilty.  I always top with a ton of chili flakes before folding and nomming out."}
{"text":"Definitely amazing za. I love the space. Cool use of bike delivery. Nice to see people take pride in what they make."}
{"text":"The BEST cheese slice in Toronto! Check out my blog below...

http://bigasskid.com/big-ass-kid-eats-north-of-brooklyn-toronto/"}
{"text":"*clap*.......*clap*........*clap*

This is my slow clap for the White pizza, which is the best slice of pizza I've had from a takeaway joint for a very long time.  The pizza has ricotta, garlic and arugula tossed in a tangy lemon juice.  Very original, very amazingly delicious.  I think it was the lemon juice that totally did it for me. 
 
Because I like indulging in carbs now and then, I also went for the garlic knots.  They were very good: chewy, flavourful and smothered with freshly grated parmesan cheese, so really, how can you go wrong?

It was a lot of food for one person and I practically had to roll myself out after finishing every last bite.  But totally worth it and I look forward to doing it again with the Seasonal Veg slice."}
{"text":"The pizza delivery guy told me I wasn't giving him enough tip and awkwardly pressured me for more money by letting me know he arrived via bike. Pizza's good but not worth the rude service."}
{"text":"Good pizza... nice interior... that's about it. Needs a little more pizzazz than pizza"}
{"text":"This is my favourite take-out pizza place in Toronto. Simple selection of toppings, really delicious pizza, and generous portions. Not a ton of seating and the staff isn't overly friendly, so I wouldn't recommend this place for a date or if you want to linger. Perfect place if you call in advance and pick up the pizza in person."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of North of Brooklyn until tonight. I ordered a pizza at 6:16pm and it arrived at 8:23pm. I called 4 times and spoke to the Dundas location and they kept saying the driver would arrive within 15 minutes and he never did. On top of that, the pizza arrived cold and mutilated (see picture below). I called to speak to the manager and the person informed me that they would offer me a free slice when I came into their location. I paid $46 for a 2.25hr late pizza, cold, damaged and poor customer service. This is a lesson to all those who choose to think the customer isn't right, that's you NORTH OF BROOKLYN. Take a lesson. Poor poor service = a forever angry former customer that will dissuade everyone from ordering here!"}
{"text":"The space is neat with hip hop blasting in the background. 

Tried two of their pizza slices: Puttanesca and White - wasn't impressed by either.  The Puttanesca tasted ordinary with a thin crust and a medicore sauce.  The White  tasted similar to a light salad.  

I was still hungry after two slices making this place not worth the money."}
{"text":"4/5!! I am not a pizza person but this place is fantastic! If you love thin-crust pizza this place is for you. It is absolutely delicious and you will definitely want more than 1 slice. It is not as oily as some of the other joints so you can afford a 2nd. Note- this is a grab & go type place so don't make it an option for date night. I recommend grabbing a slice of the margherita pizza with italian sausage and making your way to trinity bellwoods park! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza, true Brooklyn style. Be prepared to wait for delivery, they deliver via bicycle and the demand is high."}
{"text":"Just received my order and was brutally disappointed. They got the order wrong, and they only have like  pizzas on the menu- how hard is it to take an order down correctly. The pizza was soggy as shit when it came and it wasn't that hot either. With all the restaurants in Toronto, I cannot believe someone could put out such an inferior product."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery, and gave them our address. The woman on the line asked us where we were located, so I told her the address and she said they could deliver to us. 

So we waited for our pizza, and then 15 minutes later we got a call saying they couldn't deliver, that we were out of their delivery zone. I explained that we were only 15 metres north of College (their northern limit). Still no. Then I said we would walk down to College to meet them - still no. Meanwhile our kids were getting hungrier and hungrier, and we could have ordered from another place and saved 20 minutes of waiting. 

Crappy customer service, and a lost customer for life, all to save an extra 15 seconds of driving."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city, hands down. We have been ordering exclusively from NoB since 2013 and highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I was continuing with my mission in search for the best pizza in town.  After getting an approval from a good friend I decided to go for a testing.

You won't miss the place because of the large sign written on the wall.  You would expect the entrance facing queen but it was  actually facing a small street.  Something to note just in case you've never been there before 

Selections were limited and I played it safe and ordered a margherita pizza.  I waited at the seated area for about 20 minutes but I waited an extra 15 minutes because the guy who took the order forgot to tell the next person who took over the shift that it was a walk in order.  In the end no one told me it was ready until I went to ask them.  Just one minor glitch but the pizza made up for it.  

I went back again to try the other pizzas but I have to say the margherita was my favourite one.  Sauce was perfect and the mozzarella was just right."}
{"text":"Because I work in the area, the best part of North of Brooklyn (for me, anyway) is how quick and easy it is to grab a slice of good pizza.

It's nice to have a takeaway joint that offers fresh pizza with quality ingredients. Sadly, the area is rife with discount pizza outlets that are busy trying to hawk wings, poutine and whatever the latest flavour of the month is.

One slice wasn't enough, but I was full after two.

North of Brooklyn is a bit hidden. It's behind the Hero Burgers at Queen/Palmerston. It took me a few minutes to find it because, as of my visit, the signage is shite.

There's seating for about a dozen people."}
{"text":"Stopped off here the other day while wandering down Queen Street. Must say it appears to be a hidden gem and long many it last! They do pizza slices and full Pizzas (they call them pies).  We tried a selection of all and the base was thin and crispy and the topping tasted homemade, fresh and authentic. Everything was cooked just before we ordered. My only complaint is that these guys don't deliver to my home near Eglington!!!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's such a shame when a good restaurant suffers from hipster service!!! The people who work there are beyond rude and none of them have a brain in their heads. It's pathetic. Unfortunately I'm boycotting this pizza place even tho the food is good and it's right down the street.  Smarten up boys!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this pizza!  Some of the best I have had in Toronto..Try the margarita pizza or the one with the white sauce.... you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Awful awful service and delivery service. I waited an hour and a half for a large white pizza. Second time ordering for delivery. First time was a little over an hour. In which they didn't offer anything to ameliorate the situation. I didn't mind too much. I tried to give them another chance this time around and they said an hour wait. I didn't have a problem. I did however have a problem with the owner replying, \"Apparently the delivery guy left 20 minutes ago.\" After calling an hour past. I was looking to cancel my order because the situation was just ridiculous... I proceeded to ask 3 times to get it cancelled. The owner or manager I talked to then said he had a business to run and he's sorry. Then he slams the phone to hang up. Terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"love these guys. restaurant style southern italian pizza to go."}
{"text":"We just opened the box of pizza that was delivered tonight and we got a pizza that looks like someone tooka bite and it was dropped. Not sure what happened, as this is the third time we've ordered from the company, and this is clearly not up to standards.
We are very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Consistently high quality, low key atmosphere - love it!"}
{"text":"A small and intimate space that sells AMAZING pizza. Reasonably priced for the large pizza slice that you get. Service can be better, but the place is extremely hot...so, the workers have a right to be cranky. 

Open for lunch and dinner, but I wished this place opened till midnight. It would be awesome to have a late-night pizza joint that isn't Pizza Pizza...

UPDATE (February 7, 2014) - had delivery from them twice (so far...) this winter season. They still deliver on bike and the pizza is still HOT when it arrives. The delivery guys definitely deserve a big tip for feeding my belly during snow bank season."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent.. gooey chewy, but the dough could be lighter. And for the price point I would have expected more. But I do like that you can order multiple size pizzas which is great if you're just binge eating at home or if you have a massive party.  

I always order the puttanesca and not once has there ever been any anchovies in it. A lot of olives, some capers but no anchovies which is always a bit of a disappointment. The scallions in it give it a nice balance to all the saltiness of the toppings and make for an interesting pizza.

Also, because it's a lot of what appears to be students working there.. when they mess up the pizza is free."}
{"text":"I have been going to North of Brooklyn since it opened in the neighbourhood and the quality has declined at a steady rate. I ordered a large box of garlic knots; they got heated for literally 10 seconds, served cold and without any parmesan cheese. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Limited number of pies and sizes but very good quality.  Crust was nice and crispy.  Basic sauce has just enough spice to make it interesting.  Service is fast."}
{"text":"From time to time I enjoy a nice slice.  Who doesn't?  Trying this place out for the first time was a below average experience.  Pizza is below average, the people that work there are in their own little world.  I sat in there by myself (in a very small place mind you) for 20 minutes and felt very uncomfortable as the two employees carried on with an obnoxiously loud convo.  Looks like they cater to a hipster/penny pincher clientele.  My actual slice was very small and over priced.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper and I felt like hopping around different spots along Queen West one weekend, and we landed at this spot. We actually walked right past it at first, not realizing that it was just off of Queen Street. It's not exactly a large space inside, a couple of tables to sit down, and a bar type table where you can stand if there's not tables free. 

The menu is pretty simple, a few specialty pizzas or you can create your own. Pizzas also available by the slice. (Nice thing about the slices is that like the whole pizzas, they are also made to order. No premade slices sitting around here!) We went for the margherita pizza, and it was quite good! One of the better pizza experiences I've had. Beer also available @ $4 a can/bottle. (On that night they had Red Stripe and some blonde beer that I can't seem to remember...) 

Overall, a cool and unique place! Definitely will look out for this place if I'm in the neighbourhood and craving pizza, which is like always."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today, with a friend, hungry and in dire need of fixing. I'm like a goat in that I'll eat anything, including the label on the can, but I do appreciate a good slice - and I was not disappointed. 

I got the Kale and Bacon and she got the Margherita, and both were put on the counter in front of us faster than you can say \"Schmizaiolo who?\"

Only downside: there was no liquid hot sauce to slather on my slice, only chili-ish flakes. But it was a neat little side piece to watch people not realize there was raised doorway bottom when they went in and out of the shop."}
{"text":"Easily five stars.
The white pizza is excellent, but lately the delivery guys keep forgetting the arugula salad that is meant to go on top, which is annoying. However, the pizza itself is good enough that I can forgive this oversight (also I'm only about 7 mins away so usually I just wait while they go and come back).
My favourite delivery pizza, possibly my favourite ANY kind of pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and not overly expensive. Not a lot of room to eat inside but that's not a huge deal."}
{"text":"Now that is a good walk-in slice!!!!! Thin and flaky crust, good tomato sauce, and pepperoni just like the old days.... I would highly recommend to anyone out for a walk - stop in for a slice!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and finally had the chance to try their pizza.  Why did I wait so long?

Location is on a quiet residential street (Palmerston) just north of Queen and what a hidden gem it was.  

I had the margherita slice and it was simply delish. Thin crusted, tomato sauce, fresh basil, and mozzarella as simple slice should be.

The place is small, but quaint and had a nice friendly ambience. Definitely worth the trek North of Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Super tasty.

Not amazingly original but tasty. Definitely good to have a smaller scale pizza place nearby when I get the craving.

A bit over the top price wise given the simple product, but delicious and worth a splurge sometimes. Had the basic pizza and loved it. Would definitely be worth a visit or a call. The crust was amazing. Thin, perfectly done."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here twice now. The first time, the Margherita pizza arrived in a timely manner and was delicious. Tonight however, the Killer Bee pizza not only took a very long time to arrive, but was cold, completely undercooked and mutilated. Extremely disappointed, this was inedible."}
{"text":"Have to say, this was a tasty above average pizza. Definitely pay attention to the ingredients, with a dough that is soft but springy. Also quite large, definitely good to share. 

Only wish they had a few more options for toppings and pizza varieties. Would return."}
{"text":"Delicious! I usually get the toppings from the white pizza (mozzarella, garlic ricotta and arugula), but on a pizza with sauce. It's always fresh and tasty!

The bike delivery system is great, but sometimes it's not available (due to high volume of orders or inclement weather)."}
{"text":"I'm a fresh pizza freak and North of Brooklyn does that fresh chewy-tender slices thing much better than anyone - it's fancy THIN slice. Tiny place and you rarely get more than one to three options because it all sells so quickly after made.

Service and attitude can often range from rude to functionally retarded - ie. hipsters with head up their posterior - but  be friendly anyway, as this is the Terroni-level experience without buying the whole pie. Hot delectable 'Za, and I would really stick to the tomato-based ones, Basil Margerita and Oregano Pepperoni that has real meat in the sausage. They don't really cut it with the Putanesca and Bianca which seem flat tasting (no pun, muahah).

You might need two slices, and you might need repeat visits. Worth the slightly fancy price."}
{"text":"Again, thin crust style slices worth the slightly fancy price.

This location has had some of the best slices, and a few that were not so great. Overall an ace location - the one on Queen West was really lagging but they seem to have caught up as well."}
{"text":"I thought the kale bacon pizza was simple and delicious. It had amazing dough and not thick either. It was a great snack, and whatever oil or butter that was on it Was amazing. If your looking for more American style pizza go to the typical chain pizza stores near by, other wise if your looking for something different try it out."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas on my way home from work after a long day, one a white pizza that's supposed to come with arugula and the other with added arugula at additional cost. Picked up the pizzas and got home to discover ... no arugula on either of them. I called and apparently the arugula was supposed to accompany the pizzas. I was upset because the white pizza without arugula is basically bread and cheese, which I could have gotten out of the fridge at home and saved myself the money and the trip. I was upset and disappointed by the careless service."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome you can get single slices of a very good thin crust pizza in the city. The pizza is best fresh out the oven, which is pretty frequent as this place is often busy) but not too busy, which is nice. Very tasty and nice to be able to get a small bite for under $5! (although it's hard to stop at one slice!!)"}
{"text":"Was ok, the sesame seeds weren't my cup of tea. And the bike delivery just takes so long that the pizza is cold."}
{"text":"Updated review: After two months I figured it was time to give North of Brooklyn another try, considering how much I liked the location on Queen. 

I ordered two slices and asked them to leave the slices in the oven a little longer (they were barely warm last time).

This time the pizza was hot and slightly crispy - just the way I like it. My margherita slice was quite good but missing a kick to the flavour. Just a little bland. My friend's pepperoni slice was also quite good.

A solid there stars this time, I have a feeling this place will get better over time, even if it's a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, but I ordered a pizza for pickup (as I live a few blocks away). I was told 20 minutes. When I arrived to pick it up all the employees were outside having a smoke break and when one reluctantly came in, I found out they hadn't even started making my pizza. I had to wait another 15 minutes for them to hurriedly make it. Extremely poorly run. Avoid if possible!"}
{"text":"Good service trumps good food. These guys clearly don't get that. 

Pizza isn't special, and brutal slow service at a small place that's uninviting and unwelcome. We live 2 blocks over and this is no way to treat anyone let alone neighbours. Tried twice same slow rude service."}
{"text":"Because the ingredients are of such high quality (seasonal veggies; spicy, lemony arugula - yes, please!), having a vegan slice is not an insult to the palette, as it is with so many pizza places.  But it's the crust that makes my eyeballs roll back into my head....thin, bubbly, crispy....I could eat it plain.  I haven't had the garlic knots yet, but I hear they're pretty mind-blowing, as far as doughy things go.  The place itself is small, but super cool, and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Their pizza totally suck!!!
Pretty tasteless and very expensive!!!  Even Pizza Pizza is better.  However, the best pizza in the area is still at Olympic Pizza!"}
{"text":"Not worth a return visit. Good crust, tasty sauce but super skimpy on the toppings and expensive.  Ordered for take out. The box the pizza came in has nice graphics. That is about all I can say. One and done."}
{"text":"As someone who spent over two decades in Brooklyn, this place hit the spot. Fantastic pizza. Honestly, less greasy than most Brooklyn pizzerias and packed with a lot of flavor. It was also reasonably priced. I'll definitely come back here for another slice."}
{"text":"The menu is small and great. 
Some different options than the regular pizza options. 
Don't go here if you plan on having a dine in experience. It's a causal quick stop and pick kind of a place with only 6 to 8 chairs. 
But if you are a pizza lover you will be impressed with this place"}
{"text":"Love the pizzas - they're fantastic. 

But don't do delivery, unless you want to pay $30 for a lukewarm pizza later than promised, and missing toppings. 

Website says \"call and we'll make it right\". Nice idea, but really don't expect them to want to solve your problems."}
{"text":"Was quite impressed with the taste-  my bf picked it up so I did not see the place itself. It was a nice change from the typical fast food pizza, it's more jersey style.
Don't get the garlic sauce, it's basically just garlic purée, it's too strong. 
I would get this again for sure but it won't replace dirty old Pizza Pizza for a hangover cure."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this place offers legit New York-style thin crust pizza.  The toppings are simple but fresh and the crust tastes as authentic as any pizza I've had in NY.  The best part? They deliver by bicycle within a pretty large zone."}
{"text":"Good pizza served with a bit of Canadian style mixed in. Tasty sauce and crispy crust. Keeping it simple with pepperoni, cheese and sausage choices. Great place to order to-go!"}
{"text":"The other day we decided to try this place, so we called in to place an order and were told that it would be 90 minutes because apparently their quaint little delivery bike can only deliver one pizza at a time. So we told them to forget it and ordered something else from somewhere else.

Today my husband decided to just go there and pick it up himself because we wanted to try it. Worst pizza I've ever had. Worse than Pizza Pizza. Worse than Fresh Slice. I didn't know it was possible to get something as simple as pepperoni pizza so wrong. Soggy, paper-thin crust. (Except for the outside, of course, which was hollow and tough.) Barely any cheese. Absolutely terrible. I'd rather spread some ketchup and cheez wiz on a slice of toast. And I don't know what that brown dipping sauce is, but I'm afraid to ask, because it's disgusting. 

We also had the garlic knots, which were greasy and burnt on the bottom. The last one we took out of the box was just caked with gunk. Ugh.  Stay far, far away from here."}
{"text":"Registered on Yelp just so I can vent this. 

Was craving some good pizza, and after hearing about this place a few times, I called the Queen St location to order for delivery. With no greeting at all I was simply told to wait, and put on hold. After ten seconds I was hung up on...   Thinking this was an accident, I called the place again...   the same exact scenario happened. I should have given up after this terrible show of customer service, but unfortunately I proceeded to place the order through UberEats, which had this Church St location. When the order arrived, the entire bottom of the pizza was burnt. I ate a few slices thinking it wasn't too bad, but boy was my stomach hating me afterwards. Here I am after a number of trips to the washroom and the pharmacy to get some pepto, I am warning you all. A number of reviews already mention how they burn their pizza, but like me, do not make the mistake of giving them the benefit of the doubt, and assume they won't burn it."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to pick up some pizza for the evening. We were feeling quite hungry and ordered one margherita, three white pizzas, and some garlic knots. Even though the owner kindly rounded our bill down to $100 it seemed a touch expensive to me. 
Anyhow, I was practically salivating as we carried these pies back to my friends house. 
I only got one piece of the margherita before it disappeared. It was definitely tasty but nothing extraordinary. The white pizza one of my friends had been raving about really caught my eye though. It had these generous dollops of ricotta (I'm pretty sure) that gave each slice a smooth luxurious consistency and a touch of sweetness. The pizza comes with arugula for you to put on top, and the earthy flavour of the greens is the perfect balance to the sweet cheese. 
The four pies were more than enough to feed all six of us. I even warmed a couple slices up for breakfast the day after and they were still delicious. Maybe the garlic knots helped fill us up. They had a solid garlic taste with the right kick of spice in them just to keep things interesting. 

Not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was really good! A touch on the expensive side, but we also bought more than we needed. 
When it comes to pizza, better safe than sorry."}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely scrumptious. The quality and skilled preparation will leave you with your jaw hanging especially considering that a slice here is merely pennies more than the big chains. With a thin and light crust that's beautifully charred, perfectly complementary sauce and a tasteful amount and formula of cheeses and seasonings, no matter which slice or pie you get, you'll be back for more. Best of all, you can grab a can of beer, and sit back and watch the pizzaolos at work while you a enjoy one of their masterpieces. The warm vibe and incomparable food will have you smiling every time you stop by."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighborhood two hours ago and wanted to order pizza . I found this place and hoped it would be fantastic. I went out and got vino and just wanted to chill and eat great pizza. 

I didn't even finish my first slice before calling them to let them know how freaking awesome it is ! I ordered the pepperoni pie with garlic dip... Wow! It takes a lot for me to be impressed, and create a yelp account to spread the word . 

The crust is thin, tasty, attention to detail. And the garlic dip... Blew my mind! Real roasted garlic spread. And I think I tasted apple in there ??? If so wow! 
You guys are def my pizza go to! Thanks for the amAzing experience!!!
Cheers!

{"text":"Tucked inside a side street, I was walking around wondering where this place was. Luckily with the help of Google Maps, I located it and it realized that I passed by it like twice while walking on Queen Street.

I tried their pepperoni slice ($5 after tax). They heated it up for me in the oven. At first glance, I was like, \"wow that pizza is so thin\" and it was no joke. I also noticed the sesame seeds on the crust area. The pepperoni slice tasted just ok as it was not firing hot in terms of temperature as i expected to be. I am not a big fan of sesame seeds in general so the crust part was meh. Not too great and not too bad. 

Seating was pretty limited but I went during an off hour so finding a seat was ok. Overall, I would call this an average pizza place."}
{"text":"Average 3 stars? ....WHAAAATTT??

FIRST of all, I make homemade epizza all the time and know what a good marinara sauce and cheese ratio means .

North of Brooklyn gives the absolute best Margherita pizza in all of toronto.

Not pizza libretto..

Tried both and at libretto u pay the same price but get a small sized pie in relation to Pizza Pizza sizing. At north of Brooklyn their price for a pie is the sizing of an extra large and they don't skimp out on the ingredients! 

NoB has a perfect sauce, not too herby like Libretto s and you HAVE to add the roasted olives as an extra. Won't regret it!

Homemade garlic dip is to die for as well!

For everyone who gave them a negative review, they should just stick to pizza pizza,  because they don't know pizza!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Pity about everything leading up to actually getting the pizza. Placed the order on Justeat.ca and confirmation stated the pizza would be delivered in 40 minutes. 10 minutes later a rude staff member from the Queen Street location advised that they didn't have one of my requested topping and what did I want instead (the lack of topping choices also is disappointing), I obviously wasn't deciding fast enough and when I consulted my other half on his preference, sighing ensued. Once I decided she briefly mentioned that my order would be delivered at 8:55 and not 8:20 as my confirmation advised. Upon investigation it appears that the restaurant can move back the delivery time if they are busy. At 9:15 I still hadn't received the pizza and rang the restaurant to find out that they \"misplaced\" the docket and forgot about my order. This staff member (not the earlier female staff member) was very apologetic and said they would rush the order and get the pizza to me in the next 15 minutes- which they did. They also offered a free pizza the next time I order. The pizza was amazing I just wish it wasn't so late as we literally shared one slice and had the rest the next day as it was just too late! Really hope the next time is a better experience. Have to mention that Justeat.ca provided excellent customer service and even followed up with me a couple of days later to find out how it all ended and if there was anything they could do to!"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while as backup for a quick bite as those darn hipsters create lineups at any half decent place in this area. Not wanting to wait as the other place we wanted to try is notorious for wait times we settled on this spot. Frankly if I didn't know to look for this spot I would have missed it altogether as it is off Queen street and the sign at first glance looks more like its for a club. 
Nevertheless the initial impression is your run of a mill corner pizza joint. The menu is straight forward with 5 main options to choose from and the vegetarian version not being sold anymore we are down to 4 (hooray the carnivores among us get a victory every now and then) You can still add toppings on a single slice but you have to pick a base from one of the five options or go for a whole pizza of your choosing. 
Ordering was straight forward as you can pick your drink from the fridge (they had 3 types of beers, some Italian sodas and regular pop offerings) I settled with Grlosch.
We both decided to order a slice each of Margherita and the well recommended White slice. 
We were lucky as we got a slice of fresh baked one instead of the reheated version.
Visually appealing the crust was good and reminded me of NYC. Good sauce and cheese ratio with basil crowning this slice of Margherita.
White Pizza was good as well with a nice hint of garlic with fresh arugula. 
The service is bare bones but one can't expect much from this kind of spot.
The also offer delivery service for a fee which is great as the pizza is quite big and can easily feed 4. 
We have a winner here folks for a good slice and this price its I would say its a no brainer."}
{"text":"One of the better pizzas in the city. Good thickness, flop, and toppings. Had an olive pit on one slice and bit it. If it wasn't for that I'd probably give it a 5er. Also have Vegan options, good to see restaurants recognizing the demand."}
{"text":"I tried it and it didn't blow me away, however better than most. It will be interesting to see how well North of Brooklyn does and how long they last. The originally pizza in the village was Express Pizza. They owned the market for a very long time and while they don't really compare, It will be sad if the heat in the kitchen gets too hot for them but they also had a head start and if they delivered a good product, they will have no problem. Did pizza express deliver a good product or did they leave the door open for competition, any comments folks...\"   Good luck North of Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"Eating this pizza when it's hot and fresh has brought on the extra star!  If you can't get the slice straight out of the oven, I would actually order a full-sized pie and share with friends!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of there original location and rank it as one of the best by the slice pizza in the city. This location is a welcome addition as it is somewhat closer to moi and somehow there is a dearth of good by the slice pizza spots. I did try this spot a while ago but since they don't sell beer at this location I don't visit this spot when craving a slice. So for a Super Bowl get together I thought it would make sense to have the pizza delivered. However I was saddened to see that the delivery area is just a couple of blocks north of where I reside on the website . I did call in to ask whether they would make an exception but no go (not wanting a repeat of Seinfeld episode where Elaine gets food delivery by pretending to live in a building I decided to make a quick run and picked it up) Surprisingly the place wasn't busy being Super Bowl Sunday and all. I had called in ahead but still had to wait a bit to get my pizza. 
The end product more than made up for the cumbersome pick up run. The guests were happy and enjoyed the pizza. I would say 3.5 stars (half star deducted for just being outside the delivery area) so if you are within the delivery area this one is hard to beat for NYC style pizza."}
{"text":"Got take-out from here not too far back. It was delicious!  We tried one Kale and Bacon and One White. The White pizza came with Argula and dressing on the side and you could choose how much to add. Its quite tasty and very dense tasting pizza. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Went by here yesturday to check it out.  Got the Margarita Pizza never tasted somethng so fresh and thin, The service was great. I'd have to say I'd be back for a 2nd slice or maybe a whole pie."}
{"text":"Really good pizza,  really GREAT customer service, had an issue and these folks made it their mission to make me happy, and boy did they ever, Alex a huge thanks to you sir,!!! and the Delivery guy was also super awesome, just fantastic customer service...

 The pizza is very thin crust, and quite delicious, fresh toppings, really good pepperoni, was unaware that there was sesame seeds on the pepperoni pizza, but it was all good, very tasty, next time i'll ask for it a bit more well done than it was, but that's my personal taste, overall  a VERY, VERY GOOD pizza with very high quality ingredients. I'll definitely be back

You guys are awesome!!  :) Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had the white pizza topped with the fresh arugula but I gotta tell ya, its pretty amazing...hence never trying any of the others."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great white pizza and puttanesca. Good prices. Garlic knots are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Ah, North of Brooklyn. I've wanted to try this place forever it seems and I finally had the chance this week. I had the 'white' (arugula and ricotta - seems to be the most expensive on a per-slice basis so I'd recommend buying a full pie if you're eating with friends as the prices for larger sizes seem standard across pizza type). It was a decent pizza but the crust was a bit too thick and hard for my taste and for whatever reason the flour from the base kept crumbling off and thus it was somewhat of a messy eat. I wouldn't recommend delivery if you're in the financial district as the wait time is rather long but for a quick bite when you're in the area this isn't bad at all - still more of a Queen Margherita fan for now though!"}
{"text":"great pizza!"}
{"text":"Hard to tell if the pizza is good when it's delivered cold. 

Sadly, delivering to an office location can represent a lot of future business. But when you arrive a half hour late with a pos device that isn't working and cold pizza, it's pretty much game over. 6 large pizzas all looked good, and the sauce tasted nice, but why would we ever go back. It's a 5 minute walk to this location, so arriving 30 minutes late for a business lunch is unforgivable."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas you can get in the city! Quality cheeses and toppings, perfect dough and sauce. It's authentic Italian thin crust, but holds up and isn't too floppy. Stopped by for a slice during Nuit Blanche - will be ordering this at home again soon."}
{"text":"Too bad when we called to explain that our delivered pizza was burnt and inedible we were told it was \"busy\" and would likely have to wait another hour to have it replaced. I thought customer service and correcting mistakes would be priority for this otherwise great place! 
Disappointed."}
{"text":"This pizza was incredible.  I got the simple margherita (which was HUGE) and the garlic dip.   I will definitely order from here again.   Absolutely delicious- I love the sauce on the pizza too!   Sooo tasty!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here. They make New York style pizza. The menu is simple with only a few choices and you can add other toppings to it.

They have a small seating area if you want to sit down and eat the pizza. They also do deliveries.

We got the Margherita pizza with Italian sausage. The pizza came out piping hot, and had a lot of cheesy goodness. I enjoyed the combination of basil, mozzarella, the tomato sauce and the sausage. I loved the thin crust of the pizza and the tomato sauce was awesome! The sauce was a bit watery, but it has a nice fresh taste to it and the tomato flavour really shines through. The pizza is pretty big and great for sharing."}
{"text":"This place is the answer to terronis small and undersized pizza. Grab a sixer from the  beer store while walking back order a margherita pizza to go and head over to trinity bellwoods for a lovely after noon lunch. dont forget to invite friends the pie is HUGE. for $22 bucks it was a steal."}
{"text":"Got a delivery the other night, not one bit happy with their pizza. We payed for extra cheese, but there were barely any cheese to begin with. The overall flavour was bland. Never getting pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. There is only 4-5 selection of pizzas, which makes it easier to decide. The vegetables on the pizzas seemed really fresh. However, be warned that the slices are extremely greasy. 

The store itself is a bit cramped with only one table and 4-5 bar seats. I really don't suggest eating in as the barstools were much shorter than the bar table. My suggestion, get the pizza to go."}
{"text":"Self serve pizza spot. Some interesting options. Pizzas pretty good. Not a lot of spots to sit though."}
{"text":"For a shade under $10 I got a can of pop, a slice of pepperoni, and four lil' nobs of not-so-garlicky bread. 

THE PIZZA: 1/3 burnt black, large slice not cut in half so it's unwieldy, paper-thin crust, dry. They should also probably get dried pepper dispensers with smaller holes in the lid because one shake just drowned my meal.

THE ATMOSPHERE: Credit where credit is due, the look and the lighting of the place is very nice. The giant sign outside looks cool and did its job (bringing me in). I'd honestly consider taking someone here for the beginning of a low-key date, *if* the substance was as impressive as the style.

HOWEVER: I wasn't even going to post this mostly negative review, except for the final straw - no recycling! Two garbage cans, but no recycling for the aluminum can and paper products I've got left after eating. 

In 2016.

That's bullshit, and it's what made me decide to write this review. May ten thousand dicks fly into the owner's forehead on wings of unburnt, thick, juicy pizza for this stone-age bullshit of not having any recycling when they could be nailing it with one bin labelled PAPER and another labelled CANS.

If they had then I might've given them another chance, but no thanks. I should've just gone ten feet East along Queen to Pizzaiolo."}
{"text":"Simply delicious pizza! I'm originally from Brooklyn and love Di Fara on ave j, john's of bleecker, as well as corner on church ave, and let me say that north of Brooklyn won me over, it wasn't the service which is not bad, it absolutely was the pizza which really is all that matters."}
{"text":"Oh shit. Finally tried the white pizza. GAME CHANGER.

We've been getting walk-in pizzas from North of Brooklyn for about a year now. The pizza falls somewhere between American-style delivery and the trendy faux-athentic thin crust atrocities that are all the rage right now. The marguerita is delicious and, as noted above, you really have to try to white pizza. It's awesome.

Ordering by the slice you may risk getting a slice that's been sitting out for a little too long, but that might be my only criticism of this place. Prep times on pick-up orders are super quick. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Crisp thin crust... I've died and gone to pizza heaven.... Margherita is to die for... Come often!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome that you can get fancy pizza by the slice. Crust is not too burnt, nor is it soggy in the middle. Reasonable prices.

Tried:
Pepperoni (tomato sauce)
Kale and bacon (white sauce)
Arugula and mozzarella (white sauce)

My fav was pepperoni because the tomato sauce was so good. Kale and bacon was my second-fav because of the garlic. Compares to the other two, the arugula and mozzarella has the least flavour and I had to add chili flakes."}
{"text":"I've been a NOB fan boy since day one, and I've sent many people to NOB locations all across the city.

I'm a regular, and the last several times I've been, the pizzas have been uber meh.  They're no longer the fresh hot pizzas I used to get.  Now if you order by the slice, they're kinda sad and limpy.

My last Kale slice recently, the dough was almost inedible, and beyond cardboard like.  Sadly this has happened more often than not.   It pains me to update my review.

I think ordering a whole 'za is probably still pretty good.. but by the slice just hasn't been good.

I'll cross my fingers that this place can rebound to what was one of my favourite pizza places in Toronto."}
{"text":"The pizza messenger boys remind me of grown men versions of Charabs. Or like knights in shining armour who instead deliver the good news of pizza on a bicycle (permitting you live in the designated delivery zones). Having tried all four pizzas available at the Queen location I self proclaim myself as an expert. I agree with other reviewers that slices are not that filling, and it is worth it to buy a whole pie. They aren't deceiving you... The pizza and prices are right in front of your face when you go in the store. A whole pizza at libretto or Terroni (not that I'm bashing either) is close to the price of a North of Brooklyn pie, but these pizzas are pretty huge. 
I ordered three pizzas for my moving crew of five and I had a ton left over. I live pretty close but have never received a soggy pie when doing delivery. I walked in once to order a whole pie and they had it ready in 10 minutes. A woman walking behind me on the street mentioned how good it smelled with her beedy little eyes.
The first time I went, I ordered two slices and since it was nearing the end of the night they snuck in the last slice of the pie I ordered without even telling me. 
All the pizzas are good, it depends on persona preference- puttanesca is a little salty from the anchovies that are in the sauce, of you don't like salt or anchovies"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Pizza. I ordered a pepperoni for delivery the second day they started bike delivery and it arrived on-time, hot and fresh. Delivery is $2 so with tax and tip you're looking at upwards of $25 for a large pepperoni pizza delivered. This is a little steep if you are looking for cheap eats, but this place is more than worth it. 

I also tried the garlic knots in-store since my last visit and they are an excellent edition to a slice."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, it was supposed to have anchovies on it but there were none.  Also the staff seemed pissed that they had to make pizzas when more people came in.  Incredibly overpriced and the roast garlic side was awful.  Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone but my friends love it so who knows."}
{"text":"Great 'za... The way it's supposed to be done. No frills, no bizarre novelty toppings, no deep dish, fried crust, cheese bacon who knows what bullshit... Just New York style pizza.
Try the white with arugula! Grab a pie, head to trinity Bellwoods and enjoy!
Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I love the seasonal vegetable. I one time had it with kale, pumpkin, beets, etc on it and it was seriously delicious. Arugula peach salad is also very tasty. Big fan of this place! And it's affordable too. My only qualm is the overly loud music sometimes."}
{"text":"There is a way to do this place... What you need to do is order a whole pie , none of this slice nonsense. You want this za out of the oven fresh.. My advice is order the white or pepp, sit down and enjoy.. I don't suggest going there and waiting for the slice you want to come out of oven when you want it, or to have a slice reheated.
It's probably a hipster thing, they seem to have more patience than eccentric dudes like me... Potential for 4-5 stars but you have to order the whole pie."}
{"text":"The pizza is far too thin and they don't put enough cheese on it. Had the kale bacon and the kale was completely annihilated into a flaky mess without taste. Felt like I was eating a wet napkin. Very very overrated and also very very dirty inside."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 5:30 on a Wednesday night and was told it would be over an hour and a half for delivery. Okay I could do that. Ordered a Margeritta with mushrooms and pepperoni and a Ceaser salad. 
It was delivered at around 6:30 - awesome ! 
The salad was great, other than a couple bad pieces of lettuce and no crouton.....but  The bacon and the dressing itself was 10 star awesome salad. 
The pizza looks amazing but it was cold and I can't fault them for that because the delivery is on a bicycle and the delivery guy was really nice......but North of Brooklyn should purchase one of the bicycles it have heated pizza oven on the back....just sayn' since there main method of transportation/delivery is by bicycle. I guess I'll have to remember next time to preheat my oven when I order and when the pizza arrives pop it in the oven for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Decided to try Brooklyn Pizzeria after working up an appetite walking around Queen St West on a beautiful Sunday afternoon with some great company.

Settled on a Margherita pizza ($18) with sausage and mushrooms as additional toppings ($2.50 per topping). The place is quite small and the seating is limited. We seated ourselves and once the pizza was ready, they would bring the pizza to our table. While we waited, our neighbours raved about the pizza and told us they came here once a week and could never go back to regular pizza (I'm assuming pizza chains).

Finally the pizza arrived and it definitely lived up to the type, it was a fair sized pizza that worked out to around 8 slices. The pizza was fantastic, piping hot right out of the oven, it was perfectly cooked, the crust was thin and crisp but not too crispy and it was cooked thoroughly throughout the whole pizza. Some other places I have tried usually have the middle of the pizza a little undercooked. The toppings were also quite good. Like other posters have mentioned the best way to eat the pizza was to fold it by the crust."}
{"text":"They only have about three or four different kinds of pies to choose from, but boy is that sugo fresh. If your looking for authentic Italian thin crust pizza, with quality ingredients, this is the place. Try the margarita or the putanesca. A little drizzle of that EVOO (As Rachel Ray would put it) on the slices, adds that touch. I do not like the garlic dip because it has a sweetish taste. This place is best suited for takeout as there isn't much space. The service is also great."}
{"text":"Authentic NYC pizza in YYZ. It passes the critical test: the generous sized slice with the just right crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients folds perfectly for one -handed devouring while walking - yay!"}
{"text":"Please. Good tasting pizza but I waited 45 minutes to get it after I pre-ordered by phone. Total time after placing the order: 1 hour 22 minutes. This place is run by children. No experience. No professionalism.   No interest in working there (or anywhere else probably). Who waits an hour and a half for pizza? I did unfortunately and it will be the last time I ever set foot in this place. Worst experience ever.
  So I gave them another chance. Ordered delivery. Took 1 hour 15 mins. Got the pizza but without the salads. I asked the delivery guy why nobody called. He shrugged his shoulders. I Then called and spoke with Alex Potter, the owner. He said he had plenty of salad but ran out of containers to put it in. I asked why they didn't call me, it took over an hour for delivery. He said it wasn't a priority and that salads were considered an appetizer. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Third time there. It just keeps getting worse.
1) 3 pizza choices (for slices)
2) Terrible attitude. Walked in and the girl behind the counter just looked up then went back to doing whatever it was she was doing without even a \"hello\" or \"I'll be with you in a moment\". We waited for about 3 minutes before we were acknowledged.
4) she put the pizza in the over for approx. 30 seconds, was luke warm at best. I thinkl she was in a hurry to get back to her previous chore. Not even a thank you when we paid.
5) Toppings?? One piece of basil two small blobs of Fior di Latte, tasteless sauce and not even enough to cover the crust.
I'm a restauranteur  of 18 years, I understand that things happen (thats why I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first and chalked it up to growing pains)  but if you don't listen to your customers and take the appropriate action to fix the problems then you might as well close your doors. 
Sorry, wont be back and will NOT recommend them to North of Brooklyn"}
{"text":"Came 10 mins before closing and asked for the kale and bacon. They were out but instead of telling us that, they made us a fresh za. And it was so good. Bless."}
{"text":"Went here after losing the decision making power to another friend...once in a while I have to see what treasures other people have up their sleeves. I'm glad I did here, we walked in to a warm room smelling like delicious pizza. Grabbed a beer each and proceeded to work out what to order. 

I like that they do slices and whole pies. The prices are not bad and the ingredients were creative. We went for 2 and the ingredients on both were delicious and fresh. The arugula was definitely a good call on our part. 

Place is pretty small and seems more take out or delivery only. Service is friendly!"}
{"text":"I would say the worst pizza I've ever tasted. For $4.50 a crust like a ritz cracker with a \"sauce\" of crushed tomato with zero spices or garlic and zero taste, and no cheese underneath the tomato, just dry. Topped with 3 little round blobs of some tasteless cheese and one piece of basil. This thing had no taste what so ever and was no better than a tomato sandwich. You'd be better off going to Loblaws and buying a frozen pizza for $2.99. Absolute waste of money."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite take out pizza places in the city. Definitely a New York style pizza with the larger crust end and thin on the insides. I usually get the pepperoni or the kale bacon. The kale bacon is something I would of never have ordered as a \"always pepperoni pizza kind of guy, but this one is quite original and worth trying. You can order on UberEats and Foodora but they also deliver themselves if you call them directly. The service is just ok but here for the pizza."}
{"text":"WHITE $4.42 Mozzarella, Garlic Ricotta, Arugula 
Super crispy crust. The whole pizza is scrumptious. If I were to frequent a pizza place, it'd be here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had in Toronto. The White pizza is so incredible. The crust is perfect, the cheese is insanely good, and then the fresh arugula on top with lemon juice ohhh my god. It's too good. I'm happy that it's not around the corner from me because I would seriously eat this every day if it were. There is a nice area to sit as well. I just had a slice for lunch but I'm considering ordering delivery for dinner."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place and ordered a pepperoni pizza for delivery.  Great crust, amazing sauce...this pie is full of flavour!"}
{"text":"Dinning Experience: Take-out and Delivery
Specialty: Pizzas
Menu items: Pepperoni & White pizza

Brooklyn has made its way to Toronto. Or has Toronto made its way there? Probably the latter. North of Brooklyn Pizzeria, the fairly new pizza joint in town, is taking take-out and delivery to a whole new level with NYC inspired thin-crust pizzas from former Libretto staff.

The place is packed on weekends with people doing pick-up and take-out orders. Customers sit while waiting for their pizzas in the 8 seater location and their delivery girl drops by every so often in her bike to do the next delivery round. The choice of venue is petite but cozy and the decor is worth a look...

The North of Brooklyn staff, is just, good staff. No attitude, not super friendly either, and definitely the right balance of good customer service. If you order a slice of pizza that is sitting on the counter, or has been sitting for a while, and a new whole pizza of the same kind is about to come out, the staff will ask you to wait so you can get a fresh one, even though that means they will probably have to throw out that last slice on the counter. Now that's great customer service.

The pizza comes out steaming hot and huge, just like any Brooklyn-style pizza. Each slice is at least 10 inches wide; their pizza will be considered an extra large size at any other joint. North of Brooklyn offers just one size of pizza, but it seems that one size does fit all. It's finger-licking good and the dough is so thin, you can easily order one pizza for two people. Though their menu selection is limited, it seems they just specialize in what they know how to do best - cheese and crust.

Their pepperoni version is delectable with very thinly sliced pepperoni that has some heat to it and is generously sprinkled throughout the whole pizza. The crust is extra crispy with slight burnt edges and it's covered with a light drizzle of sesame seeds. The cheese is definitely not processed cheese, its a fresh mozzarella cheese that is blended in a juicy and fresh tomato sauce, bringing back memories of Libretto.

On a less tomato-y note, the White Pizza at North of Brooklyn is worth a visit. Mozzarella,  garlic ricotta and Parmesan cheeses are placed on crispy dough and topped with a tangy arugula salad. The strong taste of the garlic is well balanced by the acidity from the arugula and burn taste of the sprinkled Parmesan cheese. A must order when visiting.

North of Brooklyn Pizzeria is located on the corner of Palmerston and Queen West. You might miss it by an inch as it's actually tucked away in Palmerston, but I can assure you, you won't miss their bright big sign.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated, hyped up by pretentious hipsters (you know who they are, they're the ones that call pizzas \"za\"). Crust had crisp, but no chew or char. Sauce was ok but there was not enough of it and cheese was skimpy and tasteless.  The result was a dry pizza that needed to be washed down with diet coke with every bite.  What can I say Toronto, this was a pizza made by whitebreads who know nothing about pizzas."}
{"text":"Good fresh pizza.  Great tasting tomato sauce.  Thin and must be eaten right away to really enjoy it.  Cools down fast."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,    I tried a slice here awhile back. It was really good but small and expensive. So I always wanted to go back and try a whole pie. We had the pepperoni and added mushrooms to it.  If the pizza was really good as I was expecting the price wouldn't of been an issue. Also the pie is huge. Could fill 3-4 people easily. To bad for me that this was terrible pizza.  

It might just be me. I've tried pizza all over the world and might be a little jaded. Also I hate too much sauce on my pizza which I think is standard here. The crust was just crunchy like a cookie and all I could taste was the sauce, which I didn't like so much. This place seems to be getting pretty good review so it might just be me or the one pie I had but I won't go back here and try again and gamble that much money."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza, absolutely amazing. Puttanesca slice was so tasty and pepperoni slice was a delight."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of our neighbourhood pizza place, North of Brooklyn Pizza, I was excited to order with my husband on a Saturday night. We placed our order online, impressed to see the option. We chose a delayed order, with delivery for one hour later. I received two emails immediately after ordering, one from North of Brooklyn confirming our order and the other from ChowNow, their online ordering system explaining the system set up. Thirty minutes later, I received another email confirming my delivery time for almost an hour after I had requested - 2 hours after placing the order. This email was not received immediately as from what I understood from the confirmation email, my order had been placed.  Once received (at expected delivery time) we assumed there has been a system error with the last email, and I followed up with a call to the restaurant, who let me know they were down to one driver and that delivery times were delayed. When asked if we could pick it up, it was confirmed that our pizza was in fact ready (but would sit for nearly another hour before being delivered to us??) and we could come get it. I was told the $6 in delivery + tip, would not be returned to us when we picked up, but rather I was to call a 1-800 number to request a refund from ChowNow. As the online system requires a phone number, a phone call (or even text message!) letting us know about their staffing situation and our 2 hour wait time would have gone a long way. Beyond irritated with the poor customer service, lack of care, and unapologetic attitude for the entire experience, I cancelled my order (only to spend the next 20 minutes requesting a delivery from a ChowNow that will be received in 3-5 days). North of Brooklyn makes great pizza but would be better off to stay in their small potatoes operation as a pizza counter. Obviously expanding into a larger operation has resulted in lack of coordination and extremely poor customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered a Putanesca pizza for delivery. How awesome is it that they use deliver via bicycle. And it was hot when it came.

This pizza is quite special, really thin crust. You know those who love to eat the pizza by folding the pizza from the crust. This pizza was made perfect for doing that. The crust is quite held together but the pizza portion is so soft. I loved how I could peal the circular mozzarella pieces off. There was a slight hint of anchovy flavour, I wish there was just a bit more. The olives are pitted and the scallions was stringy and whole. Overall I really liked this pizza. I thought it might be too salty, but not at all, the hand crushed tomatos sauce were sweet. There was a slight hint of spicy, not sure where that is from though.

The price of a whole pizza is a bit high, but from a per slice perspective it's on par with any other pizza place. The whole pizza has 8 slices, and they were huge slices. 

Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is good I guess, but so overhyped I felt compelled to add the caveat \"I guess\" earlier in this sentence. 
Popped in for a couple of slices with a friend. I tried the white pizza, the margherita, and the sausage. The white was good, but tasted mostly like the arugula and oil they drizzled over top. Sausage was good. The margherita was bland. Ultra thin crust means it's not too filling, which makes it frustrating to dish out so much dough for one slice. 
Good pizza (I guess). Too expensive."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. So close to my apartment, the name was enticing. I loved the pizza in Brooklyn when I stayed there (some of the all time best pizza joints ever). The reviews of this place sealed the deal, so we ordered a Large Margherita (a favorite of mine). And had it delivered. We only live two blocks away, so when we got our pizza and to our dismay it was cold and soggy, crust was completely limp and the cheese was congealed, also the tomato sauce had an odd undertone, almost like moth balls. Super disappointing, this would have been a delightful alternative to the chains around here. Sad but true."}
{"text":"I tried the Church St location (meh), similar feelings towards this spot.  The sign on the side of the building is nicer.  The slices are OKAY, not great.  4 people jammed behind the counter, annoyed guy at cashier was dripping in sweat, kinda gross.  There conversation was annoying; 4 hipsters droning on and on about stupid stuff.  One time."}
{"text":"100x better than PIZZA PIZZA down the street (yuck, gross).
Overall if you've had GOOD/VERY good pizza this ends up in the mediocre area.
Nothing special.  Had some good Margherita slices, this was not one of them."}
{"text":"The vibe: Small, take-out style pizza joint with loud tunes and staff that definitely look more Brooklyn than Pizzeria. 

The food: The pizza is delicious! A slice is about $4.00, and it's thin crust, so if you're super hungry and/or a piglet like me you probably could eat 2, so it's definitely not the cheapest pizza in the world, but it sure is delicious. Thin crust, crumbly, and excellent toppings. I tried the white pizza and the pepperoni.

My go to meal: The white pizza was insanely good, so I'll go back for that. Delicious soft cheese topped with fresh lemon drizzled arugula. Mmmm. 

Secret: It's licensed so you can come crush a few beers and a pizza before you hit Bellwoods park around the corner."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the Killer Bee pizza I'd ordered. A friend convinced me that this place had the best pizza he's ever had- I say it's overrated.

The pizza crust was unappetizing and tough to chew. The toppings make for an interesting combination but it wasn't as flavourful as I'd hoped.

In addition, the service was dismissive and slow.

I've had better pizza and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't out of this world.. But good cheap and quick meal. Try the white pizza: garlic risotto with arugula."}
{"text":"This place is expensive ($5) as far as pizza slices go and by weight, (which is the way the Italians sell their pizza) the pizza slices are probably half of what you can get anywhere else and thus well over twice as expensive as most other pizza places.

Pepperonis used here are quite nice and that's just about the only nice thing I have so say about it.

The pizza crust was done quite poorly... it was like a dry hard cracker all the way through.

This pizzeria tries to sell off their intent to skimp on ingredients (for instance, placing dabs of mozzarella sporadically so that only half the pizza is covered with cheese) by marketing it as a hipster thing to do. I wasn't sold on it."}
{"text":"Used to order on the reg from the Queen West location. Great pizza, joke-worthy delivery (cold pizza, mussed toppings, inexplicable wait times), as others have noted. 

Few months ago I moved to Church and Richmond. You would think a restaurant at Church and Maitland would figure out a way to deliver to an address less than a mile away. You'd be wrong. Lmao."}
{"text":"Used to be amazing; now it's SO overrated. 

A large kale and bacon with sausage = 45$ for delivery. That's $5 / slice for like two strips of bacon 

Over cooked, dry, slow delivery, very few topping"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good but we were charged extra for toppings we did not order one time when I had it delivered. Would give them 3.5 stars if I had the option."}
{"text":"they told me 1 hour delivery on a tuesday night took them 1 hour 45 mins. the first time i called after an hour and 10 mins the guy said the delivery man had left 10 minutes prior - which was a lie because its 5 mins away from my house and i waited another 25 minutes before i called them again. They didn't pick up. So I didn't pick up.  I went to burrito boys instead"}
{"text":"North of Brooklyn has brought the pizza of BK to TO perfectly. I tried the white pizza and the margarita, both were phenomenal. Our group got two full pies, well priced at $22 each. 

The margarita was all you can ask for, thin & perfectly crispy crust, fresh ingredients. Classic and delicious. Not usually a fan of white pizza, but it seriously blew me away. For real, the first time I've ever gone for a second slice of sauceless pizza. It was so good. Try it, you white pie haters.  

Toronto, you've been blessed with some amazing za. Check it out."}
{"text":"Torture, pure torture...that's the only way I can describe waiting in this shop for my pizza.  Each pizza that came out before mine smelled better than the last.  This is olfactory heaven in this shop.

This is a rather new outpost (open about 1 week) of the popular pizza joint on Queen West near Trinity Bellwoods Park.  As the name implies, they specialize in Brooklyn-style pizza, which means a thin crust cooked to a crisp.  This new location, located in a basement shop beneath Woody's is already doing a mean business.  There's already a hipster single-speed bike with purple wheel parked in front...very Brooklyn.

The PIZZA choices are pretty simple.  I had the interesting Kale & Bacon Pizza ($4.40 for a slice)  It was generally quite tasty, although, it didn't quite work out perfectly.  The kale itself had dried a bit too much during cooking and the slice as a whole was too salty (not sure if that was coming from the kale itself as well).  The crust was cooked perfectly.  The white pizza on display looked awfully good and gets topped with arugula just before serving. The slices are somewhat small, 1/6 of a pizza and thin-crust, so it's not exactly value if you're really hungry.

The STAFF were super friendly and nice.  It was awesome to see so much work being done by hand in the open kitchen.  It looks like they're doing a good job to make things from scratch with quality ingredients.

The VENUE itself is quite small.  This isn't really an eat-in sort of place.  A smallish table or two plus 5 or 6 seats at a bar.  Nice view (and smell) of the kitchen.

DELIVERY starts April 15.  According to the website this location will deliver from University to Parliament and roughly from Front to Bloor/Davenport.  $3.50 charge for delivery with a 1 pie minimum.  

OVERALL, I'm thrilled to have a local pizza place in the village.  It sure beats the giant chains that pervade the neighborhood.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite pizza at all. Because of the name I assumed it would be a NY style pizza but it definitely was not. It was their own style, which is okay, but I probably won't order from here again even though it's close to home."}
{"text":"Went to North of Brooklyn the other day and was decently impressed. Longing for something different I decided to go with their \"White\" pizza (mozzarella, ricotta and arugula). On its own its nothing to write home about but when combined with spicy sausage (staff suggested) it really takes on a new element of flavour! Great for a late night or quick dinner fix."}
{"text":"Came by here with fellow Yelper, Jason C., for a slice of pizza. He got the pepperoni, and I had myself the puttanesca (considering the fact that I have no idea what puttanesca pizza was). The pizza was delicious -- thin crust and made with love.

The garlic knots were DELICIOUS. Total must have at North of Brooklyn. i absolutely love garlic bread, and this totally hit the spot.

Another note though, is that there is very limited seating there.  However, the wonderful thing is that you can get take-out and take your pizza to Trinity-Bellwoods to watch dogs play in the park!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. The crust was the consistency of cardboard, the garlic cloves were large and overpowering, so I had to take it off, take a bite of pizza, then take a nibble of garlic to balance it out, the pepperoni, which I liked as it was real calabrese style but was cut so thick I couldn't bite through it, but the WORST part which made it completely inedible was the saltiness. Even if you tried to over salt your pizza it wouldn't taste this SALTY! I don't know what they did or do but it was the saltiest thing I have ever tasted. Even when I gargle with salt water during times of a sore throat it doesn't compare. Never again."}
{"text":"Food is good but portion is very small. A slice won't fill you up. Service is sometime disappointing. Staff (including the owners) aren't very friendly. I remember when they just opened, I came by to try out their pizza and welcome them to the neighbourhood and the owner was very cold and borderline snobby. Kind of sucks because I really like their pizza (the white pizza is FANTASTIC), but the poor service sometime make me want to go somewhere else. One time I ordered a big order for a party (about 10 pizza) and they said they will give us one on the house, but they end up charging us  when the bill came :("}
{"text":"Best take out pie in the 'hood by a long shot!  The garlic knots are fantastic as are the salads.  The pepperoni, sausage and semi dried tomatoes are all awesome toppings. Be sure to order extra cheese as well, it makes it way better.  Don't forget the garlic knots, they're garlic, cheesey, salty awesomeness!  This is very different from the usual chain stuff, high quality crust and sauce. Don't get more than a couple of toppings because you want to let the flavour of of the sauce come through.

The garlic dip is too rich for me, but I know others swear by it!

The staff here are really great and excited about the food.  Unfortunately once when picking up a pizza this drunk woman showed up and was screaming  that she'd ordered an extra pizza and not making much sense. The staff smiled and handled her ranting despite it turning into personal attacks.  It's a drag they had to deal with that, they've always been really helpful and friendly with us."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza.  I just had a slice of pepperoni pizza and it was awesome.  The tomato sauce was kind of tangy and that combined with the salty pepperoni was just delicious... I could have had many slices and I can see what others mean when they say it wasn't filling.  But I take that as a compliment.  I don't want a doughy pizza,  you have any options if that is what turns you on.  Their crust was spectacular.  Light,  crispy and airy.  A real treat.  I love bread etc so I was really pleased with it.  I can't wait to try Joe kinds and eat more pepperoni!"}
{"text":"For a large pizza or slices to go,  it's hard to top this place.  They have limited number of pizza and toppings,  but I love the pepperoni one.  It is real salami not that cheap pepperoni that you get at pizza pizza etc.  Really nice flavour. The sesame seeds in the crust are really nice touch too.  Crust is super light.  They seem to use very high end ingredients here.

Give it a shot, I doubt you'll be disappointed,  I reckon it's the best large take out pizza you'll find around Toronto.  Some smaller Neapolitan pizza laces might top it but other take place does."}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone down hill. The pizza is greasy and nowhere near fresh. They also have way too much attitude, which makes zero sense for a mediocre pizza joint."}
{"text":"North of Brooklyn is a staple when we have out of town friends visiting. We usually order a white pizza and a pepperoni pizza, oh and garlic knots (when they are available). The pizza is thin crust and the ingredients taste so fresh. The white pizza is especially good with the arugula on top. I don't mind that they don't have a large variety of pizzas because what they do, they do well. They also have bike delivery which a bonus. 

My only negative comments would be that it gets very busy on weekends and sometimes you have to call back multiple times to get someone on the phone to place your order and when they are busy it can take up to an hour to get your pizza. They usually warn you before placing your order, so you can decide if you want to wait or not. 

Overall, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got a bit confused by the name; I saw \"Brooklyn\" and thought I was getting a NYC style pie, but this place seems to be all about the Neapolitan. I guess I should have known from the pictures. That's fine, I can appreciate a Neapolitan if it's made well. Theirs was good, except for something on there was way too salty. Was it the pepperoni? I get that pepperoni is a salty food, but this was over the top. It reminds me of that \"Salty Ham\" sketch from Kids in the Hall. Did you drop it in salt on the way here? Help me out here!

The staff all seem to be very lively, and very friendly. The delivery guy comes by bike, and arrived quickly. He was already talking our concierge's ear off by the time I got down there."}
{"text":"I would have to agree various magazines in Toronto that this is the best slice in the city. The Margherita pizza is to die for. I usually like more toppings on my pizza, but after trying a few other things here (which were all quite good on their own), it would be hard to go to North of Brooklyn Pizzeria and order anything else but the Margherita. 

The fact that this place has a picture of Pauly Gee from the famous Pauly Gee's Pizzeria in NYC gives this place even more credibility. I was sent to this restaurant by Pauly Gee himself in NYC who says that this is the best pizza joint in Toronto. That's how good this place is."}
{"text":"There's a North of Brooklyn pizzeria on Church??!! Whaaahhh?

Ok, I suspect everyone knew this already, but I didn't. I love the North of Brooklyn at 650.5 Queen street, so I'm very happy to have found this one. 

Why do I like this North of Brooklyn? Because there's basically only 5 pizzas on the menu. I don't have to think when I walk into it. I am a happy camper with any of the 5 because I know it will be good. There isn't a long line, there isn't a lot of much else. I go in, I get pizza, I sit, I eat. 

Oh yeah, there isn't a lot of places to sit here. Oh also, the one table they do have (there're bar stools too) is a little crooked. It didn't matter to me though."}
{"text":"Whoa. This is the best pizza I've had outside Italy. The kale and bacon was perfect and the delivery was quick and made for an easy and perfect Saturday night ..."}
{"text":"Pretty basic looking pizza, super small space. I kept it simple and ordered a few slices of margarita and thought it would be just ok but I was really impressed by how tasty it was. It would definitely be my go to for a slice or a whole pizza in Toronto. Yummy:)"}
{"text":"let me start by saying I love the pizza.... its a great pie... so I tried to order a delivery pie at 5:50pm on a Tuesday... much like have many other times... when the fella on the phone tells me they cant deliver today... which he did politely... reason being I was out of the zone (by 1 block) ... this is a classic example of a place that gets popular and then starts to operate as if each customer doesn't matter...."}
{"text":"My new favourite pizza place in Toronto. Great flavours, very good crust. Thin woodfired crust.... Sooooo good.

Off busy Queen street, got recommended by a friend who is a bike courier. They use couriers for delivery. It's a whole in the wall joint, with seating for about 8-10. 

They have pizzas ready made and they heat up slices in the brick oven. They also make fresh from scratch. They have a high turnover so the pizzas are always fresh. The slices are very big, 2 was filling enough. My favourite was the white pizza. It is dressed with arugula after coming put of the oven.  We also shared the garlic knots which were highly addictive.

They have a small number of beers available in the fridge. They had about 5 different pizza flavours when we were there. They seemed to only have 1 size of pizza if you ordered a whole pie, and it was massive."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat some pizza pie!!  Definitely a place to stop over."}
{"text":"Save your time and your money. If you order delivery, you will wait an hour and a half for pizza, and it will be cold. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I usually go here for lunch with co-workers or for a quick bite after work.

Pros:
+ great slice of pizza
+ large slice for decent price

Cons:
- no great sitting down
- slices vary in size

Food: (4.5 stars)
Amazing thin crust pizza.  I have been there a few times, and they were always making fresh pizza.  The slices are large, 2 will get you full, 1 is enough if you are looking for a slack.  The whole pizza is around $20 and it can feed 4 adults.  
Note that if you are getting slices, since they do everything by hand, the size of each slice will be different.  


Service:
They accept credit cards, and are friendly.   Since there is no waiter service a bit harder to give a detailed review of the service.  Never had issues with anyone working there.  


Ambiance: (2 stars) 
This is not a sit down place, it is a take out/delivery place.  
They do have a few seats, but not enough to have a group larger than 4, and even then you would be cramped."}
{"text":"First of all... The entrance is NOT on Queen Street, so it may be hard to find for first-timers. 

I love how thin the crust is. The Margherita pizza is amazing (5 stars). Pepperoni is more like 3 stars. 

Garlic dip is extremely garlicy. So if you're used to and love that Pizza Pizza creamy garlic... Stay away from this one... Lol 

Reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the staff was unorganized and not the friendliest for such a small restaurant."}
{"text":"I am actually very surprised that there are mixed reviews about this pizza place! I have a soft spot for North of Brooklyn.

I had the kale and bacon pizza. The kale on top were like kale chips with the savoury bacon bits that melt in your mouth! the crust is thin and it is just great!

This place hits the spot when you have your pizza craving. You should eat the pizza as soon as possible. I find that the pizza tends to get soft as time goes on!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the pizza, but I thought the crust was really bland, not very much toppings, and it was kind of pricey for mediocre pizza. 

The crust had no flavour. It was chewey, which was okay, but no flavour in the crust.

I had the pizza with kale and bacon. There was three small kale leaves, and a bit of bacon. The bacon was the only ingredient that had flavour.

The cheese was fresh, but again, had no flavour.

I probably will not go back. : ("}
{"text":"I love love love pizza and I had supper tonight at North of Brooklyn Pizzeria.  Our neighbours, Nikki and Andy, had recommended it a couple months ago so I thought I'd check it out this evening.

I ordered a 14 inch pepperoni pizza (it's six slices) to go.  I ate half of it there and took the other half home.  It was a really good pizza.  It was a thin crust pizza and there was a bit of a bite ... maybe the pepperoni.  I thought the sesame seeds was a strange thing to put on a pizza but it worked.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've grabbed a few slices here in the past and they are delicious.  It's my quick lunch choice on this strip of Queen. Simple and well prepared. 
I didn't notice bad service like other reviews here, and I would've if it was."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good! Garlic knots are also excellent. 

It's very small, so it gets a little cramped, and in the summer, I don't think they have AC! It's best to take out to Trinity Bellwoods and enjoy your slice in the fresh air."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the Pizza in this place! Had a slice of Pepperoni and a slice of the White Pizza and everything was on point! Best Pizza in TO so far. Will be definitely back!"}
{"text":"Has gotten worse since they started. I also believe the prices for their slices is just crazy. $5 come on..."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for a good thin crust pizza. We've ordered from them about five time so far and it has a well deserved place in the rotation

Pizzas are simple with good quality ingredients. 
We generally get the pepperoni, which I really like. Love the sesame seeds on the crust - nice touch. With such a minimal pizza the quality really matters and it's good. I have found a bit of variety in the pizza sauce - in one of our five orders it was off the hook the best sauce I've ever had. The other 4 were good but not off the chart. 

Ordered the garlic knots last time around - really tasty as well. Fresh, garlicky, salty goodness. 

Price is ok $40 for a large with a few extra toppings, knots and drinks.

Definitely try it."}
{"text":"BEST TAKEOUT/DELIVERY PIZZA IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO!

North of Brooklyn is simple thin crust pizza at it's best! It's so crazy good - the ingredients are fresh, and their cheese is not greasy! Their pepperoni pizza is to-die-for! We ordered two pizzas and garlic knots for delivery on a Friday night. It took an hour, and was worth every second of the wait! I will never order delivery from a different place ever again!"}
{"text":"My review will be based solely on delivery.

We are in the hunt for great delivery pizza. We got home from grocery shopping and decided to give this a try. The pizza took a long time to arrive (the guy brings it on a bike, so brownie points there). Everyone was super nice from the person that took our order to the delivery guy. We got a pepperoni pie and garlic knots.

The pizza however, arrived cold. It had great potential, it smelled amazing and the flavours were there, but none of this crazy thin-crispiness everyone's talking about. The garlic knots tasted amazing, but were also cold. Despite of the soggy and cold mess, we scarfed it down as we were starving. The sauce and pepperoni were really good.

We will go back to sit down at the shop and have it the proper way. In the meantime, no delivery for us."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I decided to try delivery. I ordered the white pizza which over the phone they said would take an hour and a half.  Luckily the pizza was delivered within the hour to my surprise. The arugula came in a separate container so that it would stay crisp. Overall, I wasn't too impressed. The pizza was overly bland and though was thin, tasted like eating warm dough. I didn't taste what people were referring to a lemon seasoning - so maybe my pizza was a dud?! $30 later, I won't be ordering the pizza again but never afraid to try."}
{"text":"I will say they have very good pizza (although very limited in choice) but the service is terrible.

Firstly they will not deliver south of queen in the downtown core, so we had to go pick up our order.  That was fine, but when my husband and father went to pick them up (I had ordered 2 very different) they had only prepared one saying I had only ordered the second one, which meant order taker had not written down the first one and forgot to do so, but chose to blame me as I asked questions on the second one.  

As they would have had to wait for at least a half an hour and I had not mentioned that I couldn't eat the cream one, they brought it home figuring we would \"make do\".

When I called the restaurant to tell them what happened, they blamed me for asking questions and they got \"confused\".  Checked but would not go 2 blocks out of their delivery zone to rectify the situation and deliver it to me.  Had we not been drinking at this point we could have picked it up, but end of the day it was their mistake and offering me a coupon for a small percentage off does not mean anything to me when I ordered dinner and didn't get it.

Yes it was Superbowl Sunday, but much like Christmas we know this is coming every year so staff up!!!!  And hire people who a) don't blame the customer b) will have a resolution other than throwing a coupon for your next visit."}

{"text":"Love the signage. We need some cool, funky signs like NOB in T-town. It's a small space tucked behind Hero's Burger so the lit-up signage is like a beacon for the wandering and aimless on W. Queen W. ( One of the words, I think, Of, was on snooze and was dark.)

 Since, two other vegetarian stomachs needed to be satiated, we ordered a full pie with seasonal veggies. The full size pie is very 'Murican in proportions. Unfortunately, the pie failed to razzle dazzle me as expected (I am looking at all of you 5 star reviewers).

The pizza was rub-a-dub-dub with beets, carrots, grape tomatoes and kale: sounds like a veritable garden on the pie! However, the lack of seasoning/condiments put me off. I don't have problems with my pizza mostly au naturale and smelling of beets, carrots, grape tomatoes but I would've appreciated some garlic (without having to pay for it) or thyme or rosemary or something to add depth and warmth to the natural flavors of the veggies. The sprinkling of poppy seeds near the outer rim of the crust was welcome. Another point, the kale was crunchier and saltier than I'd have liked.

All in all, it felt like a very large, bare-boned pie despite the abundance of the stuff on it. I guess being white and without sauce also made a difference. Sadness.

The peeps behind the counter were  helpful and friendly. Had they not been super busy I'd have asked them to share their musical tastes with me; the playlists were music to the ears!"}
{"text":"I've only ever tried their white pizza it was different... still new to the whole white pizza concept. Its good for pickup or delivery"}
{"text":"The pizza here is exactly what you pay for. Delicious slice of thin crust pizza. I had the slice with anchovies and it was not too salty, not too over powering. The olives were tender and juicy and the cheese was a nice complement.

This place is also licensed and has a cool beer selection.

Will definitely be back for a slice and brew."}
{"text":"Review for delivery.
So after reading the rave reviews, decided to order the margherita pie with mushrooms $21.50, pepperoni pie $20, garlic knots $8 and garlic dip $1.50 for the side.

Delivery was under an hour by a guy who rides a bike. By the time it gets to the door (it is winter and damn cold outside) the pizza is lukewarm -- but that's expected. Unfortunately it makes it hard to chew and the crust was hard to bite into (so note to self, don't do delivery go to the actual restaurant as I'm sure it's probably a much better food experience).

The pepperoni tasted a tad bit too salty, so make sure to have a drink. Margherita is not bad. Garlic knots were meh. Garlic dip was authentic as they mash up real garlic. Overall wasn't the amazing experience but then again, a lot of variables to take into consideration.

I would probably give it another chance in the restaurant where you get it straight from the oven to see if there's a big difference, but would definitely not have delivery again as it's not the best. But I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt. 

Cheers to the guy who suffered the cold weather to deliver us pizza. On a bike."}
{"text":"This North of Brooklyn location is quite mediocre in terms of pizza availability. They won't make a puttanesca for the house pizzas because it doesn't sell well. That's the best one this chain has in my opinion! How can you not?!

Go to the other location, or if you're in the village already just go to Pizza Nova, or eat something that isn't pizza. 

So disappointed in this location. The other location is much better and has friendlier, more lively service. I was excited about getting a North of Brooklyn in this neighbourhood but I'm disappointed at this shell of a North of Brooklyn."}
{"text":"I had a margherita slice there and ... it was ok. Nothing mind blowing. It's a good thin crust slice."}
{"text":"We went in search of a good substitute for the thin crust we had in New York City. This place does not disappoint. 

The place is small. There are a few seats, but it is mostly for the takeout crowd. You get a discount for ordering online. So take advantage of that. 

We had the margherita and white pizzas. Both were good. I preferred the white. My husband preferred the margherita. The crust is a bit chewy and tomato sauce feels a bit like canned tomatoes. But not deal breakers by any means. I would definitely go back. 

The pizzas are made from scratch so take a good 20 mins. And the prices are decent. Not a cheap eats. But you get what you pay for. Which is a pretty decent option when you can't get out to brooklyn for the real deal. 

I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and I found this pizza place on yelp. I have no dishes or food at the moment, so I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza for lunch (and dinner) and some garlic knots. 

The service was very good, and the delivery guy was very personable and friendly. My pizza looked delicious, but the dough was rubbery and the pizza lacked seasoning so it was very bland. The toppings and cheese were good quality. 

The garlic knots tasted a little burnt and the flavour wasn't consistent. Some were overly hot while others tasted good. The dough was also rubbery. 

I like to try out neighbourhood places instead of chains. Some are amazing and some fall flat. Unfortunately I think this place is overhyped. I won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"This pizza place is solid top to bottom- the killer bee pizza is a thing of beauty. A little sweet and sticky and spicy all at once with super crisp and flavorful crust. I think of this pizza when I get any pizza craving. Fairly surprised at the 3 star rating, definitely almost perfect pizza for my taste."}
{"text":"This is the most boring piece of pizza I have ever eaten.

Had one slice of margherita -- skimp on all of the ingreds and the crust tasted like absolutely nothing and old. While it looks like a classic Neapolitan pizza, it doesn't have any of that tasty, toasty, gummy, bubbly characteristics of authentic thin crust pizza.

Also, I got a garlic dip and it was literally just pure roasted garlic. Too intense, not sure how it's supposed to work.

Will never eat here again."}

I wanted to go eat but they said that I HAD TO TRY THIS AMAZING PIZZA that a coworker recommended. So I gave in and said sure. I like pizza but I don't LOVE it. Well people, this pizza changed my mind. They have a very simple menu but you can tell they use quality ingredients.  The pizza that actually blew me away was the white pizza. I never like white sauce on my pizza but they pizza was perfection. Topped with Mozzarella, Garlic Ricotta and Arugula (perfect balance).I just couldn't stop eating it. They also have really good garlic knots! If you live in the area they deliver by bike lol very hipster."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto. Tops libretto/ferraro etc... Margherita is perfect. Ingredients fresh and delicious. Very impressed. There is another location at Ossington and Dundas (on Dundas)."}
{"text":"If you like hipster pizzerias where the staff hate their lives and hate you more, then this is your place. If you like being treated like you are putting them out by buying a slice, and stare at something out the window while you thank them for the dry slice they put in the oven for 30 seconds (not exaggerating) just to say they did, then this is your place. Walk the extra block to Sud Forno, where the pizza is fresh, and the staff is lovely."}
{"text":"Ok pizza, horrible staff.
Went in and ordered 55$ worth of pizza and was red to use the washroom. It was out of order and I was told that if I wanted bathrooms I should be going to pizza pizza..."}
{"text":"Ordered large pepperoni with double pep. I enjoy thin crust pizza, but this is too thin and under cooked. resulting in an extremely floppy slice. Pepperoni was good, but sauce is lackluster. Garlic sauce was too strong and gross. I threw out most of the pizza. Their delivery takes too long since they use a bicycle deliver guy."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Crust tastes like cardboard- mine was slightly burnt. The olives are put on as whole olives- making it way too overwhelming for each bite. - one time purchase for sure."}
{"text":"Popped in to North of Brooklyn for a slice this past weekend. I asked what the Veggie option was -- the menu states that it rotates seasonally -- and the girl at the counter told me flatly that there was no Veggie slice that day. I opted for a Margherita slice instead, which had the crispiest, saltiest crust I think I've ever had on a pizza. Service was rude, prices are way too high (an entire Margherita pizza costs $18 here, and $13 at Pizzeria Libretto), and pizza was average at best. Would not return!"}
{"text":"North of Brooklyn Pizzeria's been on my to-do list for ages, but I've just never made it out there.  Queen West's a busy place with a ton of amazing eats, and somehow what's been described to me by many as possibly the best pizza in Toronto just kept sliding down my list of priorities.  I guess I'm kind of a passive pizza snob.  I enjoy pizza that's not from New York, but at the same time I kind of have to give them their due: they really, really know their stuff and if someone from New York claims they have the best pizza in the world you can't really argue with that.

BUT!  I was totally feeling pizza today, and chain-y fast food fare just wasn't going to do it.  So I dropped by North of Brooklyn at about 3 in the afternoon when it was empty, and grabbed a couple of slices.

Not doing that months ago?  BIG mistake!

The pizza here's outstanding.  The crust is thin, crisp, and just slightly chewy; the perfect texture.  It's also got quite a bit of flavor to it, with a slight and pleasant saltiness that I found drew all the ingredients together really nicely.  I had two slices - the pepperoni, which was spiked with oregano and had just the perfect amount of cheese, and the white slice.  The pepperoni slice was great - the meat was crisp and flavorful, the pizza as a whole was light but still satisfying, and the sauce played well with that inherent saltiness of the dough.  The white slice was even better!  Topped with a bit of mozzarella, as well as a fluffy garlic ricotta and a generous heap of fresh arugula, I could eat it for days.  The arugula was tossed lightly in lemon and what seemed to be a dash of vinegar and oil, giving the pizza a very light bite of citrus that worked well with the garlic, the cheese, and the hint of salt in the dough.

It's awesome.  For a little pizzeria too, the seating wasn't unpleasant; the lone banquette is pleasant and stylish, the bar seating's functional, and the place is clean, comfortable, and well ventilated.  The staff was friendly and the service was remarkably fast.  I'm going to have to work pretty hard to pry myself away from this place to try other pizza elsewhere in the city.  This place is just stellar."}
{"text":"The margherita and white pizzas are awesome - thin crispy crust...that I'll actually eat (I usually don't). Garlic knots are solid too. Small, with seating for about a dozen people and some standing room, my advice is: please don't dilly dally with idle chit chat - make room for others!"}
{"text":"Had an extremely negative experience when ordering delivery on Saturday night. It's pretty hard to screw up pizza delivery but unprofessional and rude staff on the phone and waiting 2 hours for cold pizza with half the order missing will do it. I will be taking my business else where from now on. 

First, we called four times and no one answered. Finally, we decided to order delivery online through just eat. After waiting an hour and a half, we call North of Brooklyn to ensure our order was received and the staff that answered the phone was rude and sounded intoxicated. Not cool when you're hungry and just want to know why your pizza is taking so long. 

When the food finally arrived 2 hours later, our garlic rolls were missing and the delivery guy simply told us they were out. They could have easily called to ask us if we wanted something else worth the money we were charged or refunded us the money. 

In a city with lots of other options for pizza, it isn't worth the hassle to order delivery from this place."}
{"text":"I would slap myself silly before going to any other pizza joint in Toronto.

This isn't your typical fast food pizza joint. This is the real deal. 

Normally, I usually have regrets after stuffing my face with pizza but you can polish off half an entire pizza here and you won't ever feel gross. The overall quality of the ingredients, ambience and service is just right.

I spent a fair amount of my teenage years in New York (Queens) and this place certainly brings back memories.

It blows my mind that anyone could give this place anything less than five stars. I haven't had one good experience here. I have had close to a dozen."}
{"text":"I have been to New York Area so many times and even hooked up with Yelp friends that live in Brooklyn but I eat a slice of pizza while I was in town. So is North of Brooklyn real New York Style pizza as good as the real thing? I am not sure.. but after sharing :

White ($4.40), Margherita ($3.90), Puttanesca ($4.40)

My out of town Yelp friend promised put pizza on my next eating ternary when I am in town.

The crust here was quite light and crispy. I did enjoy them but at $5 a slice which is quite pricey! I do like the laid back vibe and they serves beers!"}
{"text":"Had their margarita pizza. After warming it in the oven they grated cheese and squeezed olive oil on the pizza. The crust was thin and dry with no taste, the sauce was for decoration not for taste and yes there was a little cheese on the top with lifeless basil. 

Very disappointing and overrated. Would not recommend this place if you really like tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Again. Lame pizza. I love a classic marguerite. Again this slice came w one leaf of dries out basil. Sad. 

The Caesar?  Lack body, poorly rounded, heavy on a the pointless dressing and overwhelmed with pork bit.  

How can you miss so bad?"}
{"text":"Had a slice of the kale and bacon pizza. It was excellent pizza on a thin crust. I personally prefer a thin crust so it was right up my alley. The slice was big for the price. Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Big slice heaven. With a pizza joint like this I don't understand why people still call Dominos or Pizza Pizza. Like Notorious BIG said \"spread love, it's the Brooklyn way\"."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza  fresh ingredients I work in the neighborhood and have been there more than a couple of times I've tried the pepperoni, white, kale and bacon and margherita pizza. In my opinion it's the best pizza place in the area"}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza.................. NY style. Worth the wait! Best to get warm and fresh out of the oven! Cheers guys, well done and thx!"}
{"text":"I went to North of Brooklyn Pizzeria for a slice of pizza on a Saturday. The small shop is mainly designed as a take out place but there are about 8-9 seats available if you want to enjoy a slice at the eatery. I ordered a pepperoni and ate at the store. 

Pizza wise, I thought the crust was nice and thin but it felt too crispy. The sauce was evenly distributed and the pepperoni was present, but it the pizza was just mediocre and underwhelming. 

Service and staff were friendly though!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if they did not used canned tomatoes (although they are good canned tomatoes: San Marzano tomatoes). The slices are thin and not too doughy/bready like crappy Sobey's or other bready crust slices that are pretty much bruschetta). 

$5.00+ CDN for a slice though makes it on the lower end of the value spectrum. But Pizzaiolo and Longos charge about the same amount and probably use inferior canned plain tomatoes, while thy use the coveted San Marzano variety here.

Pie is around $20 CDN and that is where you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"First of all, the map location is wrong (not sure if it's corrected yet by the time you read this review). I don't know why I insisted on following the map when I should have Googled the address. The entrance is actually on Palmerston Ave.

You won't miss it with its fantastic, bright Hollywood-style lights!! In the daytime, you'll probably miss it.

The pizzeria is super small, it's a kitchen plus three tables. It doesn't get TOO busy but, out of respect, I'd try to finish up and give someone else the table.

The pizza's are thin, crusty, freshly made, and flavourful. Service is good! If you order by the slices, they're still pretty big!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots are the highlight at this place surprisingly enough. The red pizza was certainly a let down, the sauce did not taste as authentic as I expected."}
