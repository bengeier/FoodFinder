{"text":"I ordered from here online and I was very impressed at how quickly and accurately the order was processed and delivered. It was delivered in less than the expected wait time, and the sandwiches were wrapped and packaged very nicely. It's very obvious that this place loves good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good. Better than subway, but the wait for just a sandwich is RIDICULOUS. I waited for a good 30 minutes!!!! If I didn't already pay I would've left. Won't be going back for a while. I hope in time it gets better."}
{"text":"I went here as a part of an online deal $5.99 for a sandwich, cookie and chips. Turned out that I was not allowed to order any premium sandwiched in this deal. So I had to stick to the classic sandwiches which included around 6 options. I picked up Tuna with wheat bread and a walnut cookie (only the circular ones, you cannot get the rectangular ones on this deal). The order came almost instantly and the taste was awesome. Juicy Tuna with tomato, lettuce and ranch. Bread was fresh and the cookie too. The only downside was that the sitting place is right in front of the counter so the staff get an opportunity to keep staring at you while you're eating."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first and last time tonight. The chili had hardly any meat or beans and was runny. The sandwiches were below standard (small) for twice as much money as other sub places. Little to no taste in the Neptune. The buffalo chicken sandwich had very little chicken and had a small clump of dough on top of it. Charging for pickles is bad. Too bad they can't be more customer friendly too considering they are new."}
{"text":"On a cold day in December I stumbled into E & G's after finding out Port-A-Subs didn't offer soup and Subway still hadn't finished making the soups for the day at 12:30pm. I was delighted to find that E&G's offers up to 6 soups and chili. The chili was amazing. I could tell the chili was homemade and not a food product. I have been pleased with the other soups as well. Today I went back to try the Quattro (my first sandwich order). The mix of mayo and cranberry wasabi dressing is addicting. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the service. The order-takers have always been very nice and helpful. However, since it is an open kitchen, many of the rest of the staff have a less-than-enthusiastic demeanor about them. It's never been busy when I have been there during my lunch break, so they appear bored and uninterested in their job. Perhaps they have school and exams on their mind (assuming they hire ASU students being so close to the University). I just feel uncomfortable at times going in there, especially expecting smiles and getting blank expressions and frowns. In comparison, Port-a-Subs and Subway have far more excitable staff. Still, the soups and sandwiches will tempt me to surely return. Very clean establishment as well."}
{"text":"Was working at the  Tempe Festival and this was the closest restaurant to my booth. Ordered a turkey sandwich. It was ready in two minutes!  Wow I was impressed. Took one bite and I almost cried. All it had was mayo And lettuce. Couldn't tell what I was eating if I closed my eyes.  Two slices of processed meat and one slice of cheese. I should have asked for a refund.  I was starving so I was forced to eat half. Gave the other half to a street dude who looked hungry.  I predict this place will be closed when I return for the spring show in March. With all of the restaurant closings on Mill Ave in the last two years, this place doesn't stand a chance.  I saw at least six new places from when I was here six months ago. No clue why this place is even open for business. I hate Subway and this place is worse. For real"}
{"text":"This place has amazing sandwiches! Each one is very unique in the use of ingredients and its name. The service is very fast and every employee always has a smile on their face. I cannot wait until I can go back and try each and every sandwich. So far my favorite is the Apollo which has chicken and barbecue sauce! Yum! I hope this place stays around because I love them!"}
{"text":"I just had my soup/sub/water delivered to me and WOW!  It was here with in 15 minutes!!!  I had the Minnesota wild rice soup and the \"Flash\" sub and both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience...subs were not fresh and the manager kept yelling at the workers for not moving fast enough. If his fat ass could move fast enough on the treadmill then you wouldnt have to yell at those poor kids about speed. And i could smell him from across the room. Then a few moments after hes yelling at the workers again about handwashing...dude go take a fucking shower dont yell at the kids i should come up there and scream at his fat ass to take better care of his hygiene. Overall it could be better but just being in there hearing the manager scream and throw a tantrum almost took me out my body... Mcdonalds has better treatment."}
{"text":"My first time there, the staff was very friendly especially the gentleman at the front counter.  I order the Narmer, it was more than I could eat and tasted delicious.  The best part was the pickle!  Some places you can get a pickle on the side or couple thin slices of pickle on your sandwich, here you can also get both, but if you want it on your sammie they take the jumbo dill and slice it thick for the sandwich, and then wrap the rest for you to have on the side.  They also give you the \"guts\" which was a little weird, but nothing goes to waste. I will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Cool rewards program buy 10 get one free and get a free one at first. Makes me feel better because we are spending our savings here for my preggo wife cravings. Probably got buy 50 so getting 6 free sandwiches pretty sugar tits."}
{"text":"Good subs. Nothing exceedingly special in terms of the sub itself. Fun choices that are a little different from the typical subway/quiznos.   Super duper thing about Erbert and Gerberts is the fact that they have gluten free sub bread. And it's not like other places where your sandwich ends up half the size because the gluten free bread is tiny. This is like a true sub (maybe even wider than their normal bread). And delicious.   Not five stars only because it lacks more sophisticated stuff (sprouts, peppers, carmelized onions, hummus etc). Not really a great reason to dock them a star, because they aren't really that kind of sandwich shop, but hey, I can be fickle plus or minus a star."}
{"text":"Food is good and delivery is fast. However, all of the drivers are super rude about the coupons. Like come on...no one is trying to rip you off... You'll get your stupid coupon back!!! It's like they expect you to not have the coupon when they ask for it. They next time I order I will not be tipping! How about the next few times to get my point across!"}
{"text":"I don't know what kinda sandwich you like, but this place is awesome. Good sandwiches and quick service. Regular customer."}
{"text":"Well, as of now clearly the best subs in town. I had the \"Tappy\". The menu just says \"capicolla\" when in fact it's hot capicolla, which was fine with me. They don't put any more cheese on this sandwich than their competitors, but you can actually taste it. I'm thinking it must me aged provolone. Clean place, friendly staff, a little disorganized, but that's understandable since they just opened. Definitely better than \"Which Wich\". And about time we had an alternative to Sub(standard)Way. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why does it take 15 minutes to get a drive thru sandwich order? Jimmy Jons this is not."}
{"text":"Ate there last night, friendly staff, owner came to table. The bread is great, can't remember the name of the sandwickes, but it was chicken with cranberry Wasabi,  very good."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! A bunch of us ordered take out from here for lunch. I ordered the Apollo sandwich. It's supposed to have bacon on it. My sandwich did not. The bread was tasteless as was the sparingly placed ingredients of the sandwich. The only thing I could taste was the BBQ sauce. A far cry from the photos of subs on their website. My wife basically said the same thing about her sandwich. The only reason I gave this two stars is because the Wisconsin beer cheese soup was delicious.  I would not go back for a sub there again. Too many other good sub places in town."}
{"text":"Yes, I know they are new. The drive through was impossible, I ended up backing out so two cars in the parking lot could backup and leave. I later returned with a $2 coupon only to be told I couldn't use it at the drive through! Okay, whatever, I figure I can use it another time. The cashier then forgot to give me my change. She stared at me with a blank stare when I told her! The sandwich was just okay. Don't think I will be returning anytime soon. By the way I don't normally write these reviews, but this was such a bad experience I really needed to."}
{"text":"Quick stop while traveling.  A little hard to locate for someone from out of town but worth it.  Bill (owner)  and his staff took great care of us.  Sandwich rolls and the toppings were very fresh.  Great looking and tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while on Mill to get some ice cream with the boyfriend. We had to park sort of far and we ended up right in front of Erbert and Gerbert's. We popped in to see what was good, I'm a fan of cold cuts and subs and decided that we'd give this place a try. It wasn't bad overall for the price. The sandwiches themselves are chocked full of lots of veggies and stuff as standards but the amount of meat was a little lacking. I'm also terribly picky so without the stuff that I don't like on the sub, they tend to come out even thinner.  Overall a nice quiet little shop, but if you're picky about what goes on your sandwich this place doesn't leave much room for customization aside from removing ingredients and paying more for more of whats on it.  The boyfriend liked it, so I'm sure we'll be back again. I'll just have to try some of the cheaper options."}
{"text":"They are the best sandwich shop around. by far, the greatest sandwich shop ever. The price you pay, the unique flavor explosion that occurs in my mouth with every bite from every one of their unique sandwiches (and i've had them all), and ease of delivery makes for the best day of my life- every time I order from them. Erbert & Gerbert- these are the names of my future children, regardless of gender. Thank you for giving me infinite reason to continue living."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, mostly ordering multiple sandwiches at a time. They were out of wheat bread which is the only type of bread I can eat. When asked if there was anything else that they could substitute or offer me because of the inconvenience they said only for an additional charge. Good to know they appreciate costumer loyalty."}
{"text":"I was there the other night for the first time.  I don't really like going into Tempe, but for those who are used to it (my daughter is graduating from ASU this year), this is a great place.  The parking was a lot easier than I thought it would be, attached to the building and free for the first hour, so whew, it wasn't too hard to meet my daughter there.  My husband used to really like Jimmy Johns, (decent), but their food doesn't compare and DEFINITELY nothing like a Subway for which I was grateful.    I ordered the Titan, which has a pesto mayo (love pesto) and heard from the young gentleman serving me that they had potato soup.  He explained they carve out a portion in the bread for soup dipping.  O.k., so normally I love potato soup, not so much so in a restaurant of this type, so I wasn't entirely sold, but decided to give it a try.  It is a loaded potato soup (don't know if it's available all the time), but it was absolutely surprisingly delicious.  I would most definitely order that any time it was available, I didn't notice what other soups they had, because Potato is my favorite.  I love dried tomatoes and pesto mayo.  This is what sets them above what might be considered a typical sandwich shop.  I want to try several other sandwiches, and like the versatility of the sauces like cranberry wasabi, that is one I think I'd like to try also.     I wish my  business was closer, I'd order in :)  I think you will be pleasantly surprised. The staff was extremely personable."}
{"text":"My family and I have always been happy with our delicious Erbert's and Gerbert's subs! They are stacked with meat and veggies, plus we love the bread chunk on top. Service has always been super--both in store and delivery. Beats Milios and Jimmy Johns any day!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Their cranberry Wasabi is quite good and unique. We ordered delivery and they sent a long some extra chips which was nice. We will order again."}
{"text":"I tried this place out after seeing a friend order a sandwich from here. I looked up their menu and found some unique and delicious sounding choices. I had their buffalo chicken sub and it was about average.  The toppings and bread tasted fresh and the chicken good. However, I was a little disappointed with the buffalo sauce. It was not as tasty as some I've had and it was drenched throughout the sandwich. The service was fast and friendly.  I will probably return and try some other subs they have on the menu but I'll pass on the buffalo chicken."}
{"text":"It appears that anybody can open a sandwich shop and use poor quality ingredients and suddenly they are a nationwide chain of crappy sub shops, aka Subway. This place takes it to another level with really stupid sandwich names and then if you start reading some of the combination of ingredients on the menu, the situation gets even worse. Nothing sounded good and they use good ole' deli sliced (read - Oscar Meyer quality) turkey and other B list ingredients. Also, what is with taking the filling out of my bread? I always make fun of those people and I open my sandwich and my bread innards are laying next to my lame sandwich. I know that's your \"thing\", but at least gimme a choice. It is my bread and after all since I'm paying. In addition, they also forgot to put avocado on my veggie sub. Ironically, as I was ordering a group of folks were marching outside concerning the recent police actions. I was secretly hoping that this store would get looted, but no luck, so just avoid this poor excuse for a sub shop."}
{"text":"Our first sandwiches there were good.  I tried the lobster salad it was ok, lacking a little something but I couldn't put my finger on it.  My husband had the Narmer.  The service was a bit slow but i saw 7 people putting together sandwiches (one was the owner!), I can understand a good rush when I see one.  Need to try another sandwich or two to see if they can make me a fan."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in tempe and im only saying this because im tired of the other sandwhich shops and their gourmet shit. I just want a normal cold sub that isn't jimmy johns or subway. I love that they give you the innner bread piece with your sandwich. The sandwiches are not sloppy like jimmy johns, and they taste way BETTER than jimmy johns and subway. Plus delivery is fast and the subs are packed so tightly. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A nice addition to Sun Prairie. Good subs with some original favors. Good soups, and the service speed has improved considerably now that they got through the growing pains of their first month."}
{"text":"I generally don't like sandwich shops because I feel like I can make something at home that is better. However, E&G make some freaking awesome sandwiches that are several notches above ordinary.  They also have gluten free for celiacs and actually take every precaution to avoid cross contamination.  All around awesome owners too.  Really nice, with great service."}
{"text":"I had just missed my lightrail, so I decided to stop by this little shop right across the street. Everyone there seemed nice and the prices were ok. I chose to try the Tullius (double roast beef). The texture of the bread was a little weird, but not bad enough to ruin the sandwich. I only got about four thin layers of roast beef, which I thought was pretty skimpy for being double meat. Overall, I enjoyed the sandwich and I will go back if I ever miss my lightrail again. (:"}
{"text":"Eh. Sandwich was made quickly (Narmer) but maybe too quick. There was avocado spread all over the bread. What a mess. Friendly staff and clean place but I'd rather go to Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Flavorless sandwich with inconsistent hours. Called during posted \"business hours\" and they were not open. Please do not waste my time."}
{"text":"Well it's another sub place and I was curious what they do that the others don't. The bread is the same as Subway but the freshness and quality do stand out. They have some funny names for their subs with sauces that come with them which is ok by me. Mine was good, although I can't remember which one I had. They also have six soups that you can get as part of your meal. I didn't this time but will next. Beware of the tuna here though. I had a taste test before ordering and it is loaded with onions. I was burping onions for an hour with just that one spoonful. If onions are for you go for it.I think it's a mistake to mix it in before hand because it gets stronger and limit who will order it.  I prefer to add what I want on tuna like at the other sub shops.  This one will not be on my list if I go back."}
{"text":"That had to of been one of the saddest sandwich experiences of my life. First off it took an inordinate amount of time to go through the drive-through. It was 10 bucks for a sandwich with chips and a drink. They totally skipped on the protein of the sandwich and it was basically a giant piece of bread with a lot of veggies. Mine was supposed to have pesto on it and I didn't get even a hint of pesto.  I'll be heading back to Jimmy John's where they don't skimp on the protein in the sandwich."}
{"text":"Finally visited this place and tried the Spartan which is peppadew mustard chicken themed.  After visiting some other Madison-area sub chains, I wasn't expecting much.  But E&G exceeded expectations.  Friendly and fast service, and suuuuuper tasty sub, complete with actual crispy bacon pieces and non-slimy meat.  Bread was fresh.  Only downer is the inside seating is a bit dark and dim, but otherwise I'll be back to grab & go."}
{"text":"I got the Apollo. The bread was good but they forgot the cheese and they only put one slice of meat on it. I was pretty much just eating bread, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and BBQ sauce (which is an odd combo). Will be my first and last time eating there unfortunately."}
{"text":"Has the potential to be great. Bread was good but there was only 1 thin slice of meat on the sandwich. I actually thought they forgot to put the meat on the sandwich at first."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the \"Flash\" (Italian) sub. I used to frequent a La Crosse area E&G so I was thrilled to see one show up in Sun Prairie. I stop in once or twice a week via drive through.    E&G subs are typically flavorful, and I like the extra chunk of bread scooped out of the middle... I guess I'm a regular there now, they remember that I want a packet of mayo to dip it in without me asking.    This E&G is in a building that isn't new or flashy, but it's worth stopping if you want a good sandwich and soup. They aren't freaky fast, but not so slow as to be a problem either."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened up, they were giving away promotional half-sandwich samples. The sandwich was really good, different from the typical Jimmy John's or Port of Subs taste that I'm used to as a college student.   I decided to go there and purchase a full meal. Their chips are okay, and their soda drinks are the same fountain drinks you would find anywhere. The ambiance is very \"sandwich shop-esque\" inside, nothing too fancy or ornate, although the outside seating area is nice. I tried their iced tea, which was actually really good for fast food tea. The sandwich that I purchased was a really good spicy-chicken sandwich with blue cheese. The flavors work very well, and the choice of honey wheat as a bread is great. I think one of the most unique things they do is give you the extra bread they scoop out of the sandwich as dip or just to munch on (the bread that Jimmy John's profits off of by selling as sliced bread). Every other sandwich that I've had here is delicious.   Honestly, it's a blessing to have this place open, seeing as Jimmy John's ravages my stomach and leaves me feeling queasy with their not so fresh ingredients  The staff there are all very friendly, energetic, and talkative. They are quick in preparing sandwiches. If it weren't for recent developments, they would have 5 stars in my book. However, they stopped preparing Tea, which is the only thing there that I would want to drink (not a soda fan, allergic to lemonade/powerade). They also stopped putting the sandwich scoops in with the sandwiches, which was my favorite part."}
{"text":"Once upon a time we used to have a Quiznos, but it went away. Only a couple of years ago our Cousins closed too. It is a sad time in Sun Prairie, we no longer have 7 sub shops available. So they brought in Erbert and Gerbert's. This is because the powers that be knew the peoples' sadness. Frankly everyone knows 2 subways, 1 milio's,  1 Jimmy John's, and 1 Which wich is simply just not enough!   *eye roll*   Erbert and Gerbert's is housed in an old bank building next to Burger King. Before Erbert and Gerbert's it was a short-lived coffee shop. Before that it had an awning that hung there for 10+ years that said \"Evergreen Banking.\" Never heard of them, but anyway...........  Each sub has a goofy name and a subsequent backstory. I've seen the stories printed up on their wall. Sorry, too long, didn't read.   The two things that have caught my attention here truly, are the gluten free bread option, and the GUTS! Yes, bread guts. So once I was sitting there with my pops, and he unwraps his sandwich to find the \"guts\" of the bread scooped out and laid across the top of his sandwich. He looked at me and said \"what the hell is this??\" I explained, and he carried on.  So the bread guts is an entity you guys. He has a name \"Mr. guts.\" Check it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTYLPp4JBiE  Finally, I would just like to say, I sure do hope they bring in another sub shop somewhere in town, so we can get back to 7. In the meantime, please keep Sun Prairie in your sub shop prayers.   God bless."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop EVER!!! I am from the Midwest and lived off Erbs and Gerbs during college in Minnesota, and I am sooooo happy this store is down here in Tempe.  All of their subs are phenomenal and their soup is out of this world! Check them out, seriously,  you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience I have ever had.  Placed an order online, received no confirmation email or confirmation on the website.  Checked my bank account and was still charged.  Called the store and the guy told me my email was in my spam box, but he also did not receive any orders.  I explained to him I was still charged for the order and he claims that I was \"missing a key step\" in that I did not hit the submit order button.  I never ever yell at people, I screamed at him saying I know for a fact I hit this \"submit\" button he was referring to.  He then says the charge to my account will be on hold for 72 hours, asks if I wanted to order again.  I hung up and immediately called my bank to get the charges (yes there were multiple on there) removed.  Good subs, but will stick with Jimmy Johns from now on."}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed since I was in college many moons ago...and that's not a bad thing. They still gut out the bread and the subs are still tasty. Are they as tasty as other sub places? Pretty equivalent overall, but the taste of nostalgia adds some extra zest. Staff was kind, service was speedy, and interior was clean. If I'm ever on state street, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have a tendency to only get the lobster roll, but when you find something so good why get anything else? My friends don't agree and have ventured out to the rest of the menu. I've had a bite of their's here and there and they are amazing, but have nothing on the lobster roll. The only draw back is that it's not very filling. The staff is very quick so I haven't had much interaction, but fast is what you want from a sub shop.  Oh! Give the Snickerdoodle cookies a try. They're always soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Being from MN originally I was already familiar with Erbert & Gerbert's but it's been years since I've been to one so I was very surprised to find one here! My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Saturday. This place is small! But it wasn't very busy so seating wasn't an issue.   I got a half Narmer, which is turkey with avocado, and a cup of chicken and wild rice soup. The soup was delicious. A mainstay up in MN or WI, not too many places here do wild rice soup and this was done just right. The sandwich was just pretty good. The funny thing is that like most sub shops they cut out the center of the bread, but here they give it to on top of your sandwich. Which worked out great for dipping in soup! Anyway, like I said the sandwich was pretty good. The ingredients tasted fresh enough but I wanted the French bread to be a little softer. The bread at Jimmy John's is super soft so I was hoping for something similar. But overall, it was a solid sandwich.  There is a lot of competition when it comes to sandwich shops in downtown Tempe now but I think there's a place for E & G. Especially if you're looking for a sandwich on the go."}
{"text":"Great, quick place with lowkey the most flavor in Madison. Best sandwich in my opinion is the Boney Billy."}
{"text":"Amazing place if you're allergic to gluten. They will prepare it with separate gluten free ingredients away from where they prepare gluten subs. Just ask what subs they can make gluten free usually they know right off the top of their head. I know the girf is."}
{"text":"Meh is the perfect description.  I go in here often, and you get what you pay for (decently cheap). The free student drinks are a great perk, but the sandwich are bland. You can pay more for one of their upgraded sub concoctions, but at that point you might as well just go to Ike,s or even sub factory."}
{"text":"They don't read the notes when you order delivery. They didn't even check them at all.   They also didn't pay any attention to the 'don't add' or 'extra' sections. As a sandwich place with available customizations AND limited vegetarian options, they should pay attention to these details. I am sorely disappointed and will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered a sub for the last month from them every other week when I work my part time job. Have paid on line and ordered on line like always from work. Never had a problem ever got a great sub. Then today I place my order the same way and wait 1hr no sub??. So i called and was told they didn't have my order even though they charged my debit card $9.26 cost of the sub and $2.00 for delivery. They asked for a confirmation number I never got one but they charged me.????? So i get treated like a criminal. NO SUB FOR ME .. NO LUNCH JUST Nice. I can even show them it has been deducted from my account but doesn't matter. Calling the bank to stop payment once they are open.   Never been treated like a criminal. Honesty gets you no were.  Never again would I buy my lunch from them. Buyers beware."}
{"text":"Unlike several previous reviews I received my sandwich right away.  That seemed to be the case for others as well.  Nice atmosphere, you can sit and visit without loud obnoxious music blaring like some sub chains.  Thank you!!!  Suggest adding ice tea to the fountain area for us non-soda drinkers.  Had the turkey sub. Which was on par with Milios & jimmy Johns.  Way better than Sub Way.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches! Had the apollo and the titan sandwich and both were amazing! Way better than Jimmy Johns & Subway. Definitely going to eat there more often."}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on everyone's reviews who say this place is just like Jimmy John's to tell them they're crazy. These subs are unique (the cranberry wasabi sauce is delicious!) and the bread is soft and delicious. I literally came here because I didn't want to go to Jimmy John's and I got what I wanted! Can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"I don't know. Maybe it's because it's been so long, but I remember Erbert & Gerbert's being better. Or maybe my memory is just waxing nostalgic over the fact that in college, my buddies and I used to stumble in drunk late night Saturday into the original store on Water Street in Eau Claire, WI. After getting our food, we'd stumble the 30 yards back up to my buddies' crappy college apartment above the store. Or maybe I've been living in this area too long and have been tainted by Milio's being all over. I really don't know. Not saying I won't ever eat Erbs and Gerbs again because they're food is pretty good. It's just that something has been lost to time which makes it taste just a tad different."}
{"text":"Update: Things have improved. They knew how to make my sub, I got my cup as I ordered, service was very quick. Up to a 3 star now.   I hope the owner reads these reviews.....This E&G could do so much better. Before moving to the area a few years ago I used to eat at several E&G a few times a week.I was excited to see this one open and came here the first day. Service was ok and gave them a chance being new. Now, more than 20 visits later things have not improved, in fact gotten worse.The service is fairly slow, bith the drive thru or inside and thats even when there's hardly any customers being served, they usually forget to give me my drink when inside and have to remind then after I get my meal, meanwhile my kids are asking can we have our drinks now, I usually get a sub that is in the menu at all other E&Gs but for some reason the Pompeii is missing here....no idea why? its on the website even. It was a \" special\" and I asked for it a few times and half the time nobody knew how to make it. I gave up and just order something else now. and with this last visit all the tables were not cleaned. If things don't get in track here this E&G will be just another vacant building up for lease. I only gave it a 2 star as the subs still taste nice."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and it's been a solid 4 stars in my 'fast food sandwich' category. Compared to other sandwich places, this one gets a 4. For a small location, they do have a few tables for people to eat in, if needed. This has helped me on a rainy day before and I'm appreciative. The fun names for the sandwiches and the back stories is a fun twist. I do wish that they would branch out a bit on their flavors. Get a little creative with the sandwich flavors (veggie and non veggie), and not just creative names. Most of the sandwiches here are also available at other places. My last sandwich was full of fresh crunchy vegetables and was pretty darn good. Switch up your sauces and toppings for some 'promotional' sandwiches. It's fun for the customer to mix it up a bit."}
{"text":"I recently ordered Erbert & Gerbert's online and got a sub, chips and a cookie for $5.99 as a part of an online deal. My order came at a reasonable time and the chips and cookie were great. The sub however was extremely disappointing. I ordered the sweet chili vegetarian sub and they gave me the wrong bread. I didn't mind that too much except the quality of the sub was mediocre. The sweet chili sauce, somehow, was hard to consume and soaked the entire sandwich. The sub was also horribly light, as there were maybe 2 cucumbers, one slice of cheese and a small handful of lettuce on it. I'll never order from here again. I'll stick with Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"the only thing keeping me from raging on the employees right now is the insert of bread they  give you with your sandwich. enjoy over paying for a worse version of jimmy johns. dont come here."}
{"text":"Erbert  and Gerberts.... Cute but strange name.  Good subs great soups especially the broccoli cheese and spicy chili.  They cut a little piece of the roll off the top and that's your soup dunker... Cute idea...I like it.   Many traditional subs like turkey, ham, Italian, but some originals too like my personal fav \"The Pompeii ( sweet chili chicken salad) or \"The Quattro\" (cranberry wasabi chicken! A far cry from the genius of Cheba but a close second.  Give Em a try they deliver, or have take out or eat in. Good for soup and Sammie day!"}
{"text":"Best sub place on campus in my opinion. The ham and roast beef is delicious and filling, with good mustard. The bread is fresh. The service is good almost every time."}
{"text":"We were hoping for a great sandwich place but sadly this place isn't it. I know they just opened so hopefully they'll get better with time but I'm not sure we'll be willing to go back. Person working the cash register was giving it her best shot but didn't really know what she was doing, and then the manager (owner?) came over to help her and confused things even more.  Once we ordered and sat down and noticed that there seemed to be like 15 teenagers working with one manager, and everyone seemed to be doing something, yet it took quite a while to get our sandwiches. You'd think with that insane number of people working, food would be ready pretty quickly. When our sandwiches did arrive, both of them had this weird piece of soggy, crustless bread perched on top (it looked a scrap of extra bread that was trimmed off some other sandwich). What the heck going on with that!? It was seriously just lying on top of both of our sandwiches when we unwrapped them and we had to peel them off! Gross!   I had the Pompeii, which is supposedly their summer special. Despite being doused in a watery mix of mayo and sweet chili sauce (which made the whole thing super soggy), it had NO flavor. I couldn't taste sweet chili OR mayo- it's like the two just canceled each other out. The sandwich was also very short on toppings- there was a decent amount of chicken, but hardly any veggies Very disappointing.   The husband had the Quatro, which was better in that he could at least taste the flavor of the sauce, but it was still pretty lacking in the toppings department.  Combined with the aforementioned soggy piece of bread on top, this sandwich was just mediocre at best.  Unless the place gets it's act together in terms of service and quality of food, we will not be back.  Too bad, because Sun Prairie is seriously lacking in decent sandwich places."}
{"text":"Not looking for a big expensive meal before a Badger Men's Basketball Game, we stopped at Erberts for some subs and a side of soup for me.  Quick and friendly service. The place was pretty quiet on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving, but it was almost the holiday and a little cold/snowy out. Plus, it was way to early for any Thanksgiving eve bar goers looking for their late night snack on the walk home.   No complaints here. I ordered the Boney Billy (Turkey Breast, Tomato, Lettuce and Mayo) and a cup of loaded baked potato soup. I probably didn't need the soup and my sub, but hey I was hungry, it was cold out, and I like to eat.  It's not somewhere I would probably be a regular at, but a quick an easy stop for some food while downtown. Also great if you have young kids along who don't want to wait to eat when the local restaurants/bars are packed in the area."}
{"text":"Think of this as Jimmy Johns with wheat sub roll. The place is an exact copy of Jimmy Johns. From the menu, to the look, the atmosphere, even the receipt is similar.   The sandwich was fine, nothing special. the strange part was that they give you the inside of the bread that they removed (see pic). I didn't need it but it was different.   This location probably won't last because there is an actual Jimmy Johns on Mill that will get all the passers by. This location is not in a very accessible location when there is a lot of traffic.   E & G's is good if you are walking by and need a quick sandwich but don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"After trying out this new sub shop for a little while, I think I've formed a pretty good opinion on what's what at this place. It's a sandwich shop with a twist. They offer a drive thru which gives them a one up over subway and jimmy johns while also offering delivery. The actual sandwiches are pretty straightforward and have typical ingredients. I enjoy how they give you the cut out portion of the bread on top of the sandwich. The soups that I've tried were not the greatest. The inside eating area is very nice and clean. There also appeared to be a meeting/event room in the restaurant as well. The prices, however, are not the greatest. A single sub is about $7 which compared to subway, where you can get a whole meal deal for $6, isn't the best."}
{"text":"Good subs.  A little more variety than jimmy johns and a change from subway.  Is open till 3 am so can be a good alternative to some of the crowded late night places."}
{"text":"Ordered from Erbert and Gerbert's for the first time today. A few of us in the office wanted to try something new and none of us had ever had E&G, some folks had never even heard of it!   It was a good choice.   We got sandwiches and soups. The broccoli cheese soup was SO GOOD. It's thick and creamy, the broc is tender but not mushy (like it seems to get in lots of broc cheese soup varieties). And the flavor was perfect.   The sandwich I ordered was also super yummy. I chose the Honey Wheat bread which I really liked. It was nice and soft and the flavor was great. The \"Mr. Guts\" part of the sandwich was perfect for dipping in my soup as well. Google \"Mr. Guts\" if you don't know who he is. It's pretty silly and funny.   We will definitely be adding this place to our list of spots for lunch going forward! Can't wait to try out their catering option for big groups!"}
