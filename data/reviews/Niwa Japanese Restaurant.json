{"text":"Average suburban sushi joint. The service was so terrible and the waitress was such a rude and belittling woman with awful English skills. The food is just your basic sushi that you can get at the deli counter in any supermarket. I suggest sushi hour for better food in a similar price point. Ok not amazing."}
{"text":"Food is Ok BUT:-

Waiters don't speak good English and as a result misunderstanding happens. 

And guess what?  be ready to pay for an order you haven't order."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice small atmosphere. A little expensive, but what sushi isn't? I split the 29.95 meal with my boyfriend and it was the perfect amount. It comes with a whole bunch of choices and is the perfect amount of food. Probably some of the best sushi/Japanese I've had."}
{"text":"So we were hoping this would be our neighbourhood sushi joint, however, sadly, it won't be.  

The first time we went here, we ordered take out and we asked her if we could get the 10% off because the pamphlet we used to order stated \"10% off\" please present to staff.  They said no, for next time.  Okay, not sure why, but no problem.  The sushi was okay, but they forgot the wasabi and ginger.  How do you eat sashimi without wasabi???  Foodie that I am, I had an unopened tube of wasabi in our cupboard for just such an occasion.  Still, it was pretty good, good enough for us for a Thursday night supper. 

The very following week, same night, we went in and said we wanted take out, and said \"10% off\" for take out right?   A different server this time said, \"no\", for next time.  Okay-I get it.  There is no discount...Or, at least, not for me.  

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Go hear almost every week for quality sushi. Its a bit more expensive than some other options but worth it in my opinion. All the rolls are good and the sashimi is fresh. Pleasant and fast service when dining in. Recommend this place to anyone in Oakville."}
{"text":"This year, as a special treat I went to Sushi Niwa (that's what it says on the sign so that's what I call it) for my birthday. It was lovely, but likely would have been even better if someone else picked up the tab. Probably even better still if there was someone else there to pick up the tab.

Yes, I eat alone. Only sushi restaurants though as the incremental food serving technique these places employ allows for the least amount of time alone at a table. And by alone, I mean without any food to eat. 

I've been here a few times and I haven't had a bad experience. To my knowledge it's the best sushi in Oakville though I would be glad to be proven wrong on that one. The tempura is nice, the sushi is very fresh and tasty and the rice (key) is nicely prepared. They also have a house soup made of long, thin noodles, tempura bits and seaweed that is a great start to a great meal. 

Located in North/East Oakville in a plaza, it would be easy to miss this spot and based on the traffic I've seen in there, most have. Still, it seems to have developed a quiet but loyal following that should keep them in business there at least until I'm able to move back downtown. How convenient. 

One major drawback to Sushi Niwa is not cheap. The last 2 times I went there I spent $30+ on just myself which is simply too much. Plus, usually when I go to sushi places alone they end up giving me some free shit, not the case here. Where's the hometown discount bro? They must not actually be Japanese. We rook out fol oul rown."}
{"text":"Really good food. You get what you pay for: the price is higher but so is the quality when compared to other sushi places. 

I would recommend it on date night."}
{"text":"It's been while but we thought we would come back here as the sushi, sashimi, and service was good.  I suspect it's gone through an ownership change.

Got seated quickly but it took some time to place our order.  Ordered gyoza and edamame to start and kame sushi and sashimi dinner combo for entrees.

They still have the free noodle soup appetizer  (not sure  what it is really called!) and it's still good!  Gyoza was tasty and edamame, well you can't really screw that up.

Sashimi was ok although it came with side of regular long grain rice instead of sushi rice which was disappointing.  The fish tasted fresh but kind of bland.  I'm not sure how that happens?!  Sushi was okay.  Not sure I'll be back anytime soon.  For the price they charge I expect better quality fish and sushi rice."}
{"text":"Really great place for a quick lunch. I would recommend their lunch special. And the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi spot have dined in and also ordered take out countless times. The sushi is nothing less than amazing, always fresh and the service is really good as well. They also do party platters as well which I have ordered a few times. They are pretty good with customizing it to include what you want."}
{"text":"On the advice of a friend I tried Niwa over Mye.  What a mistake!  The sashimi was rubber. Worse than the worst food court fish. And they could not customize a roll to exclude tempura bits because they make their dressing in huge vats versus making it fresh. I left after some very poor service and ridiculously disgusting food and went directly to Mye, which was pretty decent. 

Avoid Niwa at all costs.  It was the worst sushi I have ever had, and the staff were horrible."}
{"text":"I dropped by Niwa Sushi on a earlier this afternoon and ordered the Kame Sushi to go. I haven't visited this restaurant in a really long time so I was pleasantly surprised on how great the quality has gone up. The assorted sushi pieces melted in my mouth and the food was all displayed very nicely considering it was a take-out order. In regards to service, I was kindly greeted and offered a refreshment while I waited for my order. The chef also asked me what my preferences were in regards to having the wasabi traditionally placed on the sushi which i think was nice of him to ask. I'm definitely returning and this time I will try the uni considering the quality of the other fish I tasted. It is somewhat expensive but I think it's worth it to splurge on good sushi every now and again!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place in Oakville. Prices are pretty steep, but what sushi restaurant isn't in Oakville? We came here just 5 minutes after 3 PM, missing the lunch special by a little bit. Don't make the same mistake we did because dinner is around $4 more for the same amount of food (bento box).

Boyfriend ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box while I ordered the pressed sushi. Here's where the troubling ordering began.

According to the menu, the pressed sushi is supposed to come with soup, salad, and fruit. When my boyfriend's miso soup and salad arrived at the table, mine wasn't present. 

I was confused and asked them where my soup and salad was, and they claimed that the pressed sushi combo didn't come with it...? I assume they quickly realized the menu mistake though because they ended up giving me a soup and fruit at the end - this rectified things, but definitely impacted my overall impression of the place.

The pressed sushi itself was only average. The fish to rice ratio was poor with every bite consisting mainly of spicy mayo. I'm not sure if I would order this item again, I'd probably only come here for their lunch specials. The portion size was fair - I got full, but it's probably due to the rice portion in every bite.

Boyfriend was satisfied with his bento, but disgruntled due to the price as well. 

It was a nice meal, but I'll be honest, it could have been better. The food is definitely better than the average sushi places found in Oakville, but at a pretty steep premium. I'd come here again, but only for lunch."}
