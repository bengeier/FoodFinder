{"text":"Loved this place! We were there when the city was extra crowded, and they always had a table open. Fast and friendly service! Great wings."}
{"text":"Pratique car il y a beaucoup d'espace et les serveuses sont vraiment très sympatique.   Par contre, à l'accueil, le placier est toujours très désagréable et ne veut jamais donner la table que l'on désire. Plusieurs télévisons sont de très mauvaises qualités alors si on est pas assis ont bon endroit, c'est pas top.   Nourriture 'OK'  et bonne ambiance, mais sans plus."}
{"text":"So to start no Wi-Fi. However they advertise free Wi-Fi. We ordered food and waited for it for 45 minutes considering there were almost no people. Coke was flat and watered down. The person in charge of seating people down is very rood and disrespectful. The food was server seperatly and not in a timely fashion. All in all not a good place"}
{"text":"The place is well decorated on the inside and we were seated in these comfortable leather chairs with plenty of space around us. There were plenty of televisions showing different types of sports although you couldn't hear any commentary as they also had a DJ who was playing music.   The service was phenomenal. There was an older gentleman who was one of the friendliest waiters (not sure if he was actually the owner?) Either way, he was extremely kind and attentive. He switched the channel for us when we requested and he came by our table often to top up our water and ask us if we needed anything or if we wanted to hear a particular song.   Drinks were relatively cheap but they didn't have a huge selection, so that was a little disappointing.  I also have mixed feelings about the food. We shared a plate of bruschetta and it was probably one of the best I've had to date. They were extremely generous with the amount of toppings that were placed on the bread which I appreciated. My boyfriend ordered the seafood linguine and it was delicious. However, I ordered a vegetarian pizza and it tasted like cardboard. It was probably one of the worst I've ever eaten and I regretted ordering it immensely. There was no flavour or seasoning whatsoever - it was horribly bland. I ate maybe a third of the pizza and then I couldn't do it anymore as it was far too disgusting to continue. I would probably go back again, but I would likely just stick to the appetizers and avoid the pizza at all costs."}
{"text":"Pretty poor time here. They told us their liquor license mandates that we buy food if we want to get beer; that sucks. Food and beer prices are average. There's no reason to go here when Station des Sports is a few blocks east and has far cheaper food and beer prices and uncommonly friendly waitresses. Again, just chose another close by place instead of MVP."}
{"text":"Good sports bar, lots and f room and tvs. Good salads, however chicken wings were tiny and tasted like microwave cooking. Avoid them. Other than that, service was excellent, all and all a very pleasant spot."}
{"text":"Je suis allé deux fois à cet endroit pour assister à des événements sportifs (un match de l'Euro l'an dernier et un combat de boxe).   Les points forts : la musique avant l'événement met dans l'ambiance (chansons thèmes de soccer avant le soccer et musique agressive avant la boxe); la bière n'est pas trop chère et on ne te harcèle pas pour que tu vides 12 bières avant la fin de l'événement, te faisant complètement oublier le résultat en bout de ligne; il y a beaucoup d'écrans de télé; c'est très grand, on a de la place; le popcorn est gratuit (un classique des bars sportifs); il y a des concours et des spéciaux fidélité; la bouffe n'est pas trop chère.  Les points faibles : le gars à l'accueil (le même les deux fois que j'y suis allé) n'est justement pas le gars le plus accueillant du monde (on dirait plutôt qu'il souhaite presque te faire changer d'idée et que tu ailles ailleurs - mais peut-être que c'est un grand incompris au cur tendre en réalité, qui sait ?); les écrans, quoique nombreux, ne sont pas tous de grande qualité et vaut mieux choisir sa place - ce qui peut être difficile à négocier avec le gars à l'accueil, LOL!; le quartier et les environs ne sont pas des plus paisibles (on sort de là et c'est le festival des junkies et des offres de pipes à 5$ au cinéma porno pas loin - je caricature, mais à peine, malheureusement); la bouffe est correcte, sans plus - ceci dit, on n'y va pas pour bouffer."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Sunday night. We were the only people eating, and there were only 2 people at the bar. They had a Sunday special: 20 wings for $10. The wings were great! They were not greasy, and the light flour breading was well-spiced. The sauce comes served on the side. I can't comment on any other food, but the service was attentive and friendly. They had multiple TVs showing the NHL all star game, ESPN News, the Winter X Games, and other events. I had a good experience overall."}
{"text":"I thought buffalo wild wings as soon as we walked into the doors of this place.    There isn't really anything special about this place that I could see, but it was pleasant for sitting down with a bunch of friends and having drinks.  If you want to go to a sports bar while traveling then there you have it because it was just your typical sports bar with stools and high tables and t.v.s to watch.  We had food and it wasn't horrible but nothing really special either.  We also drank several pictures of various things around $21 each.  It's not cheap but it's not hella expensive either.    If you're looking for a quiet place to relax don't come here, but if you're looking some someplace to sit and drink with friends than you have that option here.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"What's great:  MVP is always showing \"the game\" -- sometimes more than one, upstairs vs downstairs. When the Montreal Alouettes were playing in the Grey Cup in 2010, this was the only bar we could find that was playing the game (in Montreal!!!!). In 2014 for the Superbowl, this was not the only bar playing the game, but it did have seats available in front of the big screen at kickoff time when we were running around downtown trying to find a place that still had space.   Bonus points because they were showing the American TV feed with the famous American Superbowl commercials.  What's good:  Game-night specials included a $6 burger with fries and $5 pints of Boreale blonde.  What's not-so-hot: The food. MVP is officially a restaurant so their liquour license requires that you order food. My wings were scrawny bits of chicken served with sauce on the side. Fries are like Burger King. This is not a place you would choose for the grub, but we were just glad to find a good place to watch the game."}
{"text":"Stopped into MVP one night for a few drinks before heading to dinner.    There is a bar in the middle of the place with tables, big and small, around it.  They serve typical food similar to an Applebees or Fridays type place here in the States.    Drink menu was extensive with many Canadian and import beers on tap.  Mixed drinks were priced well but the timid waiter did not know how to make certain things and the barmaid was constantly walking around talking to her friends who were eating at a table.    Every night there are specials and Thursday happened to be 5 for 5 on shots (found this out when I asked for the check and instead he brought 5 shots of Jack).  Check and Jack aren't even that similiar.  Around the corner from Station Sainte-Laurent."}
{"text":"This was our first stop once we were in Montreal. Great location. Medium-sized place with lots of TV's and floor to ceiling windows.  Very friendly customer service and our food came out very quickly (we were here mid-afternoon so there were only 3 other tables).  I had the Cheddar Cheese Burger which was on for $9.99 because it was the friday special. The fries were a little greasy, but the burger was good."}
{"text":"Ce genre de bar resto est souvent un endroit pour trouver de petits bijoux dans cette grande ville ! Malheureusement, ce restaurant n'en fait pas partie ! Le resto se dit spécialisé en burger et honnetement ils ne sont pas tres bon !   Je pense que le bar est ok pour boire une biere pendant une game de hocker mais sans plus ! Par contre, le service etait tres bien !"}
{"text":"It would be a lot more enjoyable without the in house DJ playing corny stadium songs and shouting over the broadcast.  Also, the poutine isn't very good."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment and not worth it at all! It took almost and hour for a burger which showed up and was ice cold and the kitchen forgot my cheese, what can't you read?!. Server took it back and returned 20 min later with another burger that was a bit warmer and they didn't even give me fresh fries so they were cold too. SAVE YOUR MONEY. NOT WORTH  IT!"}
{"text":"Parfais pour moi car je travail le soir et que la cuisine est ouverte tard ! Ce n'est pas de la grande gastronomie mais clest honnête"}
{"text":"Definitely a tourist spot with multiple locations over Montreal but I still had a good time.  Any sport you want, they have it.  Regular bar food combined with the local brewing favorites and good service makes this place alright in my book.  We tried two locations and both had decent atmospheres.  Yeah, there are better options but when your parading around with a group of 10-12, this place makes it easy."}
{"text":"This bar was great for the first couple hours. We walked in and were warmly welcomed and seated right away. We wanted to watch the oilers game and the staff went out of their way to find it for us. I believe even the manager or owner came over to check on us. Music was great, lots of tvs to watch sports, waitress was attentive and prices are pretty decent. I noticed the manager/owner had left the bar and this is when everything changed. At about 10, the music got turned up and instead of random pop and rock songs, this house rap music was put on. It was so loud we could barely speak to each other. We chugged the rest of beers as we couldn't get out of their fast enough.  I also noticed this one guy going in and out of the place constantly which made me thing something suspicious was going on. I don't live in Montreal, but I wouldn't come back here past 10pm on any given night."}
{"text":"I really didn't find anything special about this place.    The drinks were okay.  The pitcher of white sangria I ordered was extremely weak and tasted like Arbor Mist mixed with sprite and a little bit of grenadine.  I suppose for a $20 large pitcher you can't expect much.  Its just strange that I drank 1/2 of it and felt like I hadn't had anything to drink.  The service was very good.  They were good about keeping track of who ordered what and were patient with our large party.  This was a good place to hang out with a fairly large group of people for drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the club chicken sandwich which was very dry. No cheese or any sort of condiments inside so basically toasted bread and dry chicken and bacon. My husband had the BBQ bourbon burger which was also quite bland even though it comes with BBQ sauce. It also comes with caramelized onions which are ridiculously huge....too much onion for the size of the actual burger. Patty was fast cooked so it was pushed against the hot plate, drying it out.   As for the beer (Stella) it was cool and slightly fuzzy but absolutely no head. Head is vital to a smooth sip.   Do not recommend unless you want booze and sports."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but fcuks it up by:  Hiring people who aren't into sports.  Seriously?    Not supporting the country's national pastime by investing in the hockey package or knowing what channels hockey is on.  Less than 7 days in the country and I knew more about canadian tv than the people working here.  I noticed that a number of patrons were acting up with the staff.  While we didn't as guests in the country, I can understand the locals being annoyed with the staff.  These 2 things are unacceptable for a \"sports\" bar in Canada.    With that being said, the food was delicious which is worth a star.  Only problem was I came her primarily to watch a hockey game (Senators) and they couldn't find it.  I had to go to the hotel and watch it."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I had the vegetarian ALT which was a sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I would probably not get it again as it was pretty boring for the price. The avocado were also not sliced so I just got huge bites or just avocado. The salad and fries on the other hand, were very good!"}
{"text":"I like big fancy restaurants but i go to Mvp at least once a week, i tried everything on the menu it is so cheap and soooo good! Best service from the waiter, he is so fast and knows what i like and takes care of me. I recommend the quesadillas, the poutine, the thai salad, the chicken wings, pizzas are good, and my favorite is that great plate of shrimps and rice!! Delicious... Oh and dont forget to try the salmon and rice, really good to."}
{"text":"It's funny that so many people are commenting on the food here. This is a place to drink beer and watch sports and its good for doing both of those. Why would you expect anything else? They fill you're glass when it's empty and are friendly. The prices are reasonable and the selection is adequate. Only drawback is that the bar is small relative to the size of the space and can get cramped."}
{"text":"Nice sports Bar à mtl, c'est un bar typiquement américain, les gens connaissent le sports. Bcp de tv, il manque un peu de décoration sportive. Les prix sont abordables, bonne place pour nfl-foot  7/10"}
{"text":"The waiter we had was a complete dick, the wings sucked and the atmosphere sucked. Way overpriced as well. Boring."}
