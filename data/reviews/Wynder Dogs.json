{"text":"I used the Groupon Deal today.  $4.00 for a hot dog (basic toppings), fries and a lemonade.  It was worth $4.00 but that should have been the regular price (thinking that a Costco dog is much bigger, better and cheaper) and not a Groupon Deal.  If the real cost was $8.00 without the Groupon Deal...it would have been a TOTAL FAIL.    In all fairness to this new establishment...the seasoned fries were good, the skinny little hot dog was at least on a toasted bun and the lemonade was a large size.  The staff was friendly, HOWEVER, they need to learn some proper etiquette in front of patrons.  Yelling your to-do list in front of customers left them glancing at each other with that \"Really?\" look. Then the two ladies who work there sat at a table between their customers and talked obnoxious business in a volume suitable for a concert.  I was offered a refill on my lemonade, which I appreciated, but I don't particularly like when a grown woman (without a southern drawl) calls me sweetheart (just my personal preference).    I had seen this place many times and was hopeful that it was going to be a true gem...but I won't return.  Total disappointment."}
{"text":"Yummy hot dog, fries were delish, and super great price. Only complaint was I wished the hot dog was bigger cuz it was so good."}
{"text":"Great little place in downtwon Phoenix. You can even sit outside and watch the light rail go by. Service was great and loved the dogs. Great job!"}
