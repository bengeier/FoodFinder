{"text":"We arrived in 10° weather two days before Valentine's Day. Needless to say, we had the place to ourselves. The hostess was very nice and the waitress was very professional. They even brought a little heater over to our table to make sure we weren't cold. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful building but nothing seems to survive.  We arrived around 6:15 and there were only 2 other tables seated in the main dining room with a large party in the back room.  Nicely decorated.  We couldn't fire out where the hostess stand was at first and we did not see any staff for several minutes. Another table arrived and asked us where the hostess was.   Finally someone came out and apologized stating that  everyone was busy with the large group.  The menu online states they are vegetarian and vegan friendly but I saw nothing on the menu but salads.  I asked our server when we finally saw her and when she was able to check on our table again 20 minutes later I had to remind ner that I had asked.  There was a risotto option or a pasta option available that evening.   I ordered the cheese board and Maine lobster and crab bisque for my meal.  Very nice bread arrived and my cheese board was lovely.  The bisque had maybe 2 bites of lobster or crab in it so at $12 I didn't think it lived up to the price.  I'd wanted to check this place out for a while now but sadly it was disappointing overall."}
{"text":"We just recently had a bridal shower here in their backroom.  I can not say enough about the food, service and the friendliness of the owner.  Everyone make my event a hit.  In fact, I liked it so much that I book the rehersal dinner the following month.

If you have not been there - check it out!  Friends of the party have since visted the restaurant and raved about the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch.  Very reasonably priced.  Pretty interior.  Semi-Casual dress.  

Fabulous beef barley soup and hamburger.  The soup was served \"French onion style.\"  The 10 oz. flavorful meat was quite generous in size with dark green lettuce, tomato, delicious onion (either red onion sautéed or marinated...not quite sure...nonetheless different from anything I've had). We had our choice of cheese and chose Gouda.   The burger was served on toasted bread; which was not typical white bread.  It was flavorful and a treat.  I'm not really a French fry person, but these were so beautifully seasoned and not greasy that I ate many of them.  The half pickle slice on the side was crisp and flavorful.  We don't usually drink at lunch but everything was so good that we decided that their specialty drinks were worth trying.  Once again, we were not disappointed and not surprised to find them exceptionally delicious.  We live about 35 minutes away on the West side of Cleveland (West Park) and will go back soon.  I've raved about them to family and friends already.

Friendly workers and excellent service.

....When I got home I looked them up on the internet.  I found out that the chef and part owner is Tom Quick, who was chef-owner at both Zinc Bistro and Picolo Mondo in downtown Cleveland.  Check out their site.  They have a patio and a large interior with private party areas as well as a bar and dining room.

I'm very excited that we just happened to stop by on a whim and found a gem.  I would highly recommend trying them out.  .  We loved our whole experience."}
{"text":"Our experience was VERY disappointing!  My husband has been bugging me to go there so we happened to be in the area and finally went.  We were there around 5pm on a Friday and they were NOT busy at all.  To start with our server Marisa, was less then friendly (surly is more like it). She didn't not go over the specials we had to ask about everything.  I ordered a filet (medium), my husband ordered the fish fry.  It took forever to get our salads, they were good and the bread was good.  When the meal came my filet was over done. When I questioned \"is this what medium looks like\" she took the plate away (to show the chef I assumed).  She returned with a new knife and fork but did not say a word about my food.  The chef came back out to question how I wanted my filet.  I said medium, he said that it was medium to medium/well (the way the server put in for)...it was done more then I like but I didn't want to wait even longer for my food.  After several minutes, my plate returned and this time it was even MORE done (it looked like they cooked it more to warm it up).  So now my filet and mashed potoatoes were dried out...not what I paid $22 for.  

My husbands fish fry was less then impressive also.  It was $18 for 4 small pieces of fish with fries and coleslaw.  It was ok...but not worth the money.  

Overall I can say I have had better steaks at Longhorn along with better service for less money!  We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened at what used to be Cabana's, and before that the Blue Point Grill.  We enjoyed a great meal at this recently opened restaurant (9 weeks now according to one of the servers).  It was nearly empty when we arrived before 6 p.m., but was over half-full by the time we finished our meals.  

Our server was friendly and kind to our five-year old daughter.  There was a children's menu with the usual burgers, pasta and grilled cheese, but they did not have any plastic cups.  She had fun using two little straws in a glass, but you might want to bring a safer cup for younger children.  

The food was a nice mix.  There were some local ingredients (cheese from Middlefield), and even Kobe beef (which we did not try).  We shared a green salad, I enjoyed the veal meatloaf, and my husband said his bouillabaisse was delicious.  Bread with hummus and butter was provided with the meal.  

I hope others will try this restaurant and keep it in business!"}
{"text":"Went with another couple and Mom for an impromptu dinner. Last time we were here it was Cabanas, didn't realize it had changed hands so we were apprehensive then pleasantly surprised. This is a really pretty space in a historic building. It felt muggy inside like the air conditioning wasn't working so we went out to the patio which is lovely. 
The service was good and the food excellent. 35 minutes from ordering to entree with salad and apps in between which is exactly right for an evening out. This is the only place I have been to that gives prices along with descriptions of specials. 
I had potato crusted cod with Carmelized onions- delish. My only critique is that risotto came with it which is a heavy rich side dish but they allowed me to sub a tavern salad. I really think entrees should come with some sort of veggie.
Others had trout, the sirloin, clams, beet salad and everyone really liked their dishes, all were prepared well. 
I'm glad we went, we will return. These Indy restaurants are precious! We need to support them. In turn keep working on your service Matchworks. Seems like the only possible issue. It certainly isn't your food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the Match Works Tavern last night.  Instead of requesting a table, we camped out at the dimly lit cool bar where we enjoyed incredible martini's made to perfection.  We requested the lunch menu and was graciously offered it without complaint (some restaurants will not offer as you know)  We were not too hungry, so I ordered the crab cake appetizer which was delicious and my wife ordered the triple decker grilled cheese which also was huge and featured mozzarella and american cheese with bacon and tomato, unbelievably good, thank heaven she gave me a few bites!  All in all a great place for drinks and dinner for reasonable prices.  Go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had my rehearsal dinner here. Worked with Denise ahead of time, and appreciated her willingness to work with me on my budget. We ended up with a three course dinner - leafy salad, chicken piccata, then a variety of different pastries for dessert. I had a few rude guests insist they didn't want chicken, but Match Works complied and brought them steak instead. Food service was a little slow, and we didn't actually start eating dinner until close to 9pm (arrived at 7:30), but the drinks were kept full and no one really noticed."}
{"text":"I checked in again. As usual a nice big boy glass of Pinot Noir was generously poured. It complimented my muffalatta sandwich of french ham, soprassatta, and pastrami with olive relish so perfectly. I wish I lived closer :("}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was 50% occupied.  Its kitschy and unique but not sure what they are trying to accomplish.

Our server was nice enough but he apologized over, and over, and over...90 minutes to get the food.  Out of this, out of that..like the kitchen was running on a shoestring budget.

Once the food came, awesome.  Great presentation, hot, cooked to perfection, but we literally were standing ready to leave because nobody could tell us where the food was.  The poor waiter too really had no idea and was embarrassed.

So if you can afford to wait and wait, it's worth the wait.  Place is clean, well lit and decorated."}
{"text":"My husband and I booked the Atrium for our son's and daughter-in-law's rehearsal dinner. As some of us know, when there's a special occasion there are no do-overs. It's make it or break it and after meeting with Denise I felt as if she genuinely understood and embraced this concept. It was her goal from beginning to end to make our evening as special as the event should be. Whatever I requested, from the chilled salad forks to ordering an off menu dessert, Denise's answer was always the same. She'd jot it down in her notebook and say, \"Not a problem. We can do that.\"  She suggested that we pre-order and took it upon herself to email our guests the personalized menu and a follow up phone call if necessary which thankfully left me without that extra chore. But no matter how accommodating Denise was if the food was substandard the event would be deemed a disaster. I am please to say that the appetizers, entrees and dessert were as excellent as her attitude. My Strip Steak that was paired with Crab Mashers rivaled Morton's in their heyday and my husband's Cedar Planked Salmon was moist and perfectly prepared. From the edible art that was presented on 3 tables on one side of the fountain that graces this elegantly rustic room, to the center pieces on our tables, the staff that anticipating our every need, Chef Tom's flexibility and execution of his menu, from beginning to end, there was no need for a do-over at Matchworks Tavern."}
{"text":"I want to give Match Works 5 stars as our experience was a 5 star performance, but I am concerned about reviews Ive read on other sites about the service being slow and inconsistent on busy nights.

The night we went the place was VERY quiet. The service was friendly and we were greeted right away. The food was prepared perfectly and was delicious. I had the tavern steak and my wife had the potato encrusted cod. We couldnt decide which was our favorite! The lobster bisque was also delicious. 

Ive read several reviews about the food being under-seasoned. For me, the Cleveland restaurant scene is overly-enamoured by the \"sweet and savory\" trend and Match Works doesnt seem to conform to that fad; much to my delight! So, I wonder if people really are experiencing under-seasoned dinners or they just seem that way when compared to the rest of what's out there. For me, our choices were prepared perfectly and didnt suffer from any misguided though well-intentioned experimentation. 

As I said, the night we went the place wasnt very busy. Almost every restaurant drops in quality to a certain degree when things pick up and the true mark of a great restaurant is the ability to handle the extra load. I want to go back on busy night and try again. Im hoping to be able to give this place a 5 star rating!! Thanks Match Works!"}
{"text":"This location in the old match factory is a nice location, but it seems to be jinxed.  It has been one restaurant after another and the all seem to quickly die.  This one is certain to follow and it will not be a loss.

The concept is nice, sort of modern twists on some classic dishes.  They have both small plates, what they call 'bar snacks' and main courses.  But the execution just doesn't work.

My wife had a seasonal tomato and mozzarella salad, I had the house, then she got the lamb shank and I got the pork schnitzel.  Everything was a little (or more than a little) under-seasoned.  And the chef has no clue as to what schnitzel is, this was a big thick pork chop, and it was a little dried out and over-cooked.  My wife's lamb was pretty good, but she said the stuff with it was dull.

The service was pleasant and fast, but it doesn't make up for it.  And the two salads, two dinners and one beer (my wife had water) was $55 - way over-priced for what we got."}
{"text":"I worked in a school cafeteria & know re heated & warmed food. This $38 Mother's Day brunch was just that. Pre plated deserts that had dried out , Cold scrambled eggs that had been cooked long before I had placed my order. The potatoes were warm. My husband found 2 chicken bones in the soup. 
What a disappointment!
beautiful building though....
."}
{"text":"Wait staff was horrible and the food not much better.  Our waitress was very ill tempered while we heard others working tables around us being much more friendly.  Ours did not even bother telling us about the specials.  One of our steaks was way too well done.When she send it back, the chef came out to argue about the proper pinkness of \"medium\"! Both of us were shocked. Never saw this happen before.

 Portion sizes were very small for the price.  Overall, a big disappointment. We will probably not go back!

Btw... We were there early evening  so they were not very busy... no excuse for such poor service.  I was there especially for their advertised \"Friday Fish Fry...assuming a fish fry was all you can eat like most places but not here. They don't tell you until after you've already ordered.

Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My recent visit was the fourth time at this restaurant..... And every time it just gets better and better.

This trip we did a clambake and it was spectacular the clams were done well the chicken amazing the appetizers a delicious rib or clam chowder were great as well.

Additionally the amazing blue cheese olives in the martinis were not an additional charge. LOL (see one of my previous reviews)

I simply can't wait for our next trip to this restaurant. Thank you Tom and Denise for a great clambake !!"}
{"text":"Good food but really poor service.  Had the chicken marsala dish - very good. Relatively new server - long time between sightings."}
{"text":"I see that they've taken the risotto off the menu. Good call, since they weren't actually serving risotto -- which specifically takes arborio rice. I tried it and immediately realized something was up. Asked and the hostess came back admitting that the chef had decided to cut a few corners. She was nice about it, but that's a very off-putting experience.

If it were the only time something like that had happened, I'd chalk it up to an off day. But more than once I've ordered something only to discover that what came out did not resemble the title or description.

I see another review from Greg S that mentions the hit-and-miss service, and I see he had a crazy experience with the chef as well."}
