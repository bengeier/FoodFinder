{"text":"Usually when I goto a restaurant and have a bad experience I just never go back.  But this particular visit leaves me with such a bad experience that I have to warn other people about this place.  We had a large family of 11 and and waited over 25 min just to get a menu.  We pratically had to beg for it. There was one waiter that made no eye contact with us for the whole night and just kept circling around doing nothing. (Which later we were told he was the manager)  Finally when we spoke to Sharla (which was the only waitress  doing all work)  She tried her best to accommodate us being how busy she was.  A good manager delegates his team and helps with the entire process.  A simple acknowledgment of how busy they were and an apology would have been the right thing to do.  Bad customer service is one thing from the manager, on topof that....he had tripped into my sister's chair and elbowed another party member in the head.  Yes he said sorry but was not sincere at all.  Really!!??  I dont think i ever wanted to punch out a manger so bad.  Only thing that deserved a star was the steak.  Cooked perfect and very flavourful.  Too bad the shrimp was raw.  Not only did they not offer any discount or a dish redone but everyone that ordered shrimp had to put it all in 1 plate so they would recook the same shrimp and bring it back to us on a plate for us to divey up. How ghetto is that? Are we having Hot pot??!!   I can't remember the last time I've dined at a restaurant with such poor service.  If you ever feel like a thrill and try the steak.  BRING A HELMET in case you get elbowed and a torch to sear your raw shrimp.  If the owner wants to stay in business in such a competitive area  there needs to some changes made in the front of the line staff.  Sharla should be recognized for her efforts in customer service or for just simply being human."}
{"text":"This place is only getting 1 star because I can't give it 0 stars. There are no redeeming qualities about this place.   1. Service is terrible and nonexistent. I say nonexistent because our party at down for a good 30 minutes because we got any water or menus. And this was on top of all the staff ignoring eye contact and our asks for water. We could have prob gotten up, walked out the door, and nobody would have noticed or cared. When we finally waved down one of the waitresses, don't want to name her here, she was bustling all over the place trying to make up for the lack of trying on the part of her manager. Poor girl.   The service was also horrendous because I got elbowed in the head by the manager. Yup, that's right. I got a pretty standard and disingenuine apology and that was it. Yeah the place was small but hitting your customers in the head, not cool.   2. Food was meh. Really wish this could have saved the day but in between waiting forever for everything, and feeling pretty much ignored, the raw shrimp didn't help. A few people of our party order tiger shrimp fettuccine. Shrimp came raw, obviously transparent and undercooked and they offer to recook the shrimp for us. Again, that was it.   As we were leaving, we noticed that other tables also received more shrimp in their pasta than our tables. We wondered about that since our pasta looked very underwhelming. Now we know why, this place chose to provide lesser service to just our table.   In the spirit of summerlicious and trying out new places, this is a no-go for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fantastic service.  Our favourite was the Black Tiger Jumbo Shrimp and lamb chops.  Angus Strip Loin was very good too."}
{"text":"The food was mostly good but the service was terrible. We went for my daughter's birthday dinner. We had to wait half an hour for a table even though we had a reservation. The salad arrived and it had no dressing so we ordered a calamari. The calamari was pretty good. Then we had to wait one and a half hours for the main course. The main course was pretty good but they cooked my daughter's steak too little. Then we asked if they would prepare the desert for us. Then our waiters said that the deserts that we had ordered from the beginning for summerlicious they had no more of. We had seen the people who came an hour after us were eating food before us. The time that it took from getting in to getting out was two and a half hours. To their credit, they did reduce our bill by one third."}
{"text":"AMAZING RESTAURANT!   The food was delicious and service was impeccable   Great for dates   A good amount of selection  Food was prepped well and fast  Not to mention well played  I will go again and again"}
{"text":"Awful. This place is just a disappointment. My friend and I went here for Summerlicious on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't very busy but by 7:30pm there were more customers. By the end of the meal, we wondered if anyone could possibly enjoy their meals.  We ordered the following: * Crispy Fried Calamari * New England Clam Chowder  * 6oz Striploin Steak * Pannacotta * Apple Crumble  The calamari looked decent but boy appearance can fool you. It was doused with a lot of salt, it was so bad and when adding lemon it made it entirely worse. It was hard to stomach. The clam chowder was very watered down and didn't wow me in any manner. To be honest even canned soup would have tasted better.   The steaks we had were another disappointment. It was cooked medium rare, fine, I'll give you that but everything else was confusing. First off, we weren't given steak knives! Were we supposed to cut our steak with a butter knife? We had to wave down another server to get \"steak knives\" but the knives we received weren't very sharp and not proper steak knives. I suppose our steak was at fault, it was tough and hard to chew. It was a hard enough time trying to cut the steak and one bite was enough. It was VERY salty. Even the fries were salty, which I had 1-2 pieces which was all I could stomach. I am not sure why the chef likes salt so much. At this point in our meals, we gave up on anything tasting decent.    For dessert, the Panna cotta was awful and was overwhelmingly infused with an excess amount of vanilla extract. It was inedible. The Apple Crumble was meh, not too bad in comparison to everything else we had.   At the end of our meal, a different server asked how our meal was and I explained to her our issues with the steak. She offered to have something else made for us, but honestly, I don't think anything would taste decent here. We opted for the bill and our server finally showed up. We had to ask for the bill twice and when we did get the bill, my friend had to input the amount into the machine himself. I have never seen this before, plus the server was hovering over us and not giving us any privacy. It was so unprofessional.   Overall, this restaurant should not even be part of Summerlicious it was awful and not even worthy to be included. The server we had was awful, he was overbearing at one point than disappeared throughout our meal. He was awkward, asked us many times if we wanted wine when we declined from the start and made this an even more uncomfortable experience. To top things off, my friend ended up with stomach issues because of the excess amount of salt in all our dishes we tried. DO NOT COME HERE! For a set price of $38 / per person - this was not worth a dime of what we ended up spending."}
{"text":"Came in over the weekend to try out their summerlicious and I must say the experience was beyond disappointing.  We were pretty much ignored after being seated.  No server came with water, had to request for a high chair 3 times and after 25 mins,  had to ask if we could be given menus!   There was one individual server that was avoiding eye contact with our table from the time we sat down,  perhaps because he wasn't thrilled about looking after a party of 12 as we noticed he was only trying to look after the smaller tables.  The place is small in size and there did not appear to be any assignment of tables/sections for each server, he clearly just chose to avoid serving our table.  He also was the one that ignored our high chair request,  he seated people that came in after us,  gave them menus and took their orders.  It turns out this server was  actually the manager, how sad.  We finally were able to get a waitress there to help us out.  She was apologetic and tried her best take care of us.  In terms of the food,  I quite enjoyed the clam chowder and steak frites. Five members of our party ordered the tiger shrimp fettuccine and all five, not just one or two or even three but all five guests were served uncooked,  raw, still translucent shrimp.   Instead of taking each of our dishes into the kitchen to have the shrimp redone, we were asked to throw all our shrimps onto a single plate together to be brought back into the kitchen for cooking,  seriously??  Then for dessert, they ran out of the apple crumble... on the first weekend of summerlicious, not impressed, nor were we impressed with the panna cotta and cheesecake options on the menu.   But wait, just when we think the experience can't get any worse,  it does.  The manager ends up elbowing one of us in the back of the head.  No doubt it was accidental,  however,  the apology itself was insincere and artificial.   As we left the restaurant, we noticed a table of four that ordered the shrimp fettuccine and they were given three tiger shrimps each,  those in our party that ordered the same entree only received two shrimp each.  Unbelievable.   Honestly,  I generally go onto yelp to read restaurant reviews but never take the time to write them. The experience would have to be exceptionally extraordinary or exceptionally poor to motivate a review out of me.  Overall, the lack of acknowledgement made by the manager from the time we walked in,  failing to come by to apologize for the under cooked shrimp issue, and offering such a weak apology for hitting a customer in the back of the head, lands them a 1 star and that's being generous only because yelp doesn't offer a no star option."}
