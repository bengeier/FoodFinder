{"text":"I am not a review person, but this place is a real treat and under appreciated  Very solid wine, even a Sonoma Valley wine I used to be a member of when I lived in San Francisco. Just had the food for the first time and the Sooresseta, Artichoke flatbread was outstanding. I have been staying in hotels down the street while traveling and moving to the area.   Now as we move here I'll be sure to continue to stop by."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Usually visit a few times a week for breakfast or lunch as I work in the area.  Usually have a good lunch sanwdich special that isn't on their regular menu.  Everyone is always nice.  Decided to finally give the new night menu a shot and was not disappointed.  Great place for a relaxing night out.  Completely different atmosphere from daytime.  They have patio lights, the fire pit lights were on and gave a nice comforting feel.  The servers were friendly and the manager even came around to say hello.  My wife was thrilled he offered her some sample wine from their new house menu.  Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area.  Highly recommend the mini gyro burgers and bistecca Rooney's"}
{"text":"I love Rooney's. I'm so thankful it's in my neighborhood. House made sangria and tapas to die for. In a great spot in Charlotte and great customer service. They really take care of you there. Also, family friendly."}
{"text":"I literally eat here breakfast, lunch, and, dinner the food is fantastic, the staff is phenomenal, Tyler the Chef is not only an incredibly nice guy but a great Chef and the whole atmosphere keeps me coming back, if you haven't eaten here you need to, the balsamic flat bread and meatballs are two of my personal faves."}
{"text":"The best place in Ayrsley, but that isn't saying much. The food was surprisingly good and the people who work there are also great. Go for Happy Hour you won't be disappointed.  UPDATE: This restaurant is now closed. Yelp hasn't caught up to this yet.  Go to EatitCharlotte.com for a more in depth review."}
{"text":"Rooney's Market is now serving tapas style entrees in the evening, and they have updated their look. We went in for a birthday dinner and to try out the new menu. It was fantastic.   To start, we shared the soppressata flatbread. Honestly, we could have eaten just that the whole night and left satisfied. The artichoke hearts paired surprisingly well with the pepperoncinis and the cheese was rich and so tasty.   We also ordered the Baja street tacos, the filet medalions, and the mini gyro burgers. All three entrees were delicious. The Baja tacos were packed with flavor. The lime really came through in the chicken and the cilantro lime sour cream was perfect. The steak medalions rested on beds of garlic mashed potatoes. The beef was tender, and the mash seasoned just right, but the cabernet reduction was the standout of the dish. I think we all liked the gyro mini burgers the best. Served in a fresh, soft pita, the burgers were cooked perfectly. I do wish the really flavorful tzatziki sauce was served at the top of the sandwich, so I could have enjoyed it through the whole pita, instead of finding it like a little, creamy treasure at the bottom. My one other criticism is that the chicken (in the tacos) and the beef (medalions) could have done with some salt. Neither was lacking in flavor, but a pinch of salt would have really brought everything together in my opinion.   For dessert, we shared a slice of the chocolate cake and the strawberry shortcake cheesecake. This was a fanciful concoction that combined a layer of vanilla sponge with a layer of cheesecake, and topped with strawberry mousse. I've never loved strawberry shortcake, but this was a delightful take on the dish. As for the chocolate cake, this may be the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten (and I've made it my business to sample as many as I could). The cake was both moist and light and the frosting had a deep cocoa flavor. I am usually careful to portion out my cake so that I don't get too much sweet frosting in one bite, but this frosting was not sickly sweet and could be eaten with impunity.   Though they have paired down on the provisions portion of the establishment, there are still a variety of candies and drinks that you can purchase to take home. There is a large selection of beverages available, from beers and wines, to specialty sodas. That said, I actually loved that they served water like a boss. I typically drink water when I eat out for the simple reason that I prefer water. 8 times out of 10, when you order water as your main beverage, you can count on never getting a refill, even as you watch the soda and alcohol drinkers at your table get 2 and 3 refills. Rooney's delighted me by bringing a chilled bottle of water to the table. The water glasses came adorned with a cucumber slice and I could fill up as often as I wished (though often the server beat me to it).   The staff was friendly and helpful and service was quick, especially for a Friday night. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rooney's Market twice now...both times my boyfriend and I were treated to exceptional service. The chef was awesome because he was willing to make the bruschetta vegan for me. He even came out personally to make sure we were okay with it. The wine selection is solid; and the happy hour deal can't be matched. Hands down the best deal in the city. More people should go! I'll definitely be back, this is a spot now in my rotation."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to the area. I had the Wabit sandwich and will be back for his again as well as to try other items. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Rooney's out during a small soft opening last week. Everyone there was super friendly and I'm looking forward to having them in the complex. I tried the QC Gobbler which is essentially Thanksgiving on an everything bagel!! I'm in love with it and am dying to try it hot. My co-worker got the WABit (their house signature) which is roasted turkey, granny smith apples, brie, walnuts, raspberry preserves on a sourdough bread. However she got hers as a wrap!! She said it was amazing, so it's definitely on my list to try. Their sides looked delicious however I haven't tried one yet. That will change this week now that they are officially open. Two bonuses for me: they are carrying Pasta Provisions (small selection) in one of the coolers, and they are carrying Revolution tea (the earl grey lavender is one of my favs) !! Once I've had a chance to check out all the items they are carrying in stock I'll be sure to update my review, however for now I am LOVING this new additions to Ayrsley!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! They have renovated and it's next level!! The food Is phenomenal and the wine is great! The ambiance is so amazing as well as the service and such great outdoor seating!!! Would recommend to anyone girls night out or a quick bite hands down a must!!"}
{"text":"Where should I start.  The ambience is exactly what my husband and I wanted for date night.  Great music playing and we started with some wine. So good!  Here's comes some food.  - lamb meatballs,  hmm yes please! Perfect - prosciutto crostini with creamed Brie and fresh basil, run, don't walk! Perfect! - walnut salad with candied walnuts... yum yum yum. Julienned green apples too. Perfect! - Sopressata, artichoke, and pepperoncini NAAN flatbread.... holy smokes is this good! Perfect  - and as if we weren't already full to the brim we then ordered mini lamb sliders. Zatkiki and mini warm pitas for the win.    Please visit this place.  You will be blown away by the quality and creativity of this food.  The best small plates.  We will be back VERY soon!  Chef- you NAILED IT!!!"}
{"text":"I write this 1 star review to state my story. I came to Ayersly as a coordinated barcrawl. I am the DD, I know exactly how I asked for a sweet wine. The waitress apparently didn't like my demeanor and refused to serve me. I'm honestly beside myself, I have never in my life been questioned on if I should be served. The manager talked to my husband who told the manager I'm high energy and this is who I am sober, I'm not doing anything.. I asked for sweet wine. That is all. Don't refuse a sober yelper. You turned us off to all Ayersly."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm on a 12 day business trip to Charlotte staying in the area. I've been here for 5 days and I've been to Rooneys 3 times. Hands down the best place to go. Half price bottles of wine on Tuesday's, great customer service, and amazing food. I've had the Greek flatbread, mediterranean salad, beef medallion skewers, Ramsay Cabernet, and Laguna chardonnay. I give it all 5 stars! I will miss this place when I go back home. Thanks for making me comfortable during my stay and I'm sure I'll be back some more before I leave!"}
{"text":"Of all of the tapas restaurants I've enjoyed, my favorite is Rooney's Market.  My wife and I went for dinner with her extended family. Everyone ordered a different item on the menu and every item was appetizing. In addition to being unique and flavorful, every plate had a delightful presentation.  If you are looking for the best tapas restaurant in Charlotte, look no further. Rooney's Market is the place to go."}
{"text":"Popped in here last week for a sandwich with a co-worker.  It was cozy and pleasant and a welcome addition to Ayrsley.  There does not seem to be anything else like it nearby.  There was a market area of the various provisions and ready made food items, wine and beer.  The beer selection was mainly macro but there were some good craft choices too.  The decor is funky and relaxing - shabby chic.  My Italian sandwich was very tasty, and the pimento cheese potato salad was good.  My co-worker enjoyed her sandwich as well.  I'll be back to check it out soon.....I hope they fare well, as it is a nice change."}
{"text":"My parents came to visit last weekend and wanted a quick bite to eat outside because it was gorgeous. I suggested Rooney's because we live in the apartments right there and I've always wanted to check it out. I just got a glass of wine and a bag of chips because I wasn't too hungry, but my parents both got sandwiches and loved them. We sat on the patio with my puppy and the woman that took our order brought out a dog bowl full of water for my pup and a little cup of bacon (how nice!!). The customer service is excellent and they have an outstanding selection of beer and wine. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"### closed now ### Really nice place good sandwiches assortments of different beers and snacks. $2 beers! Happy employees nice addition to what is obviously an up and coming area"}
{"text":"Rooney's is close to my work, I come here pretty often for lunch. Its great, seriously great. Good sandwiches, very decent beer selection, and pretty good prices to boot. I always get the wabbit, its my go to. Its delish - turkey, cheese, apples sourdough bread. Can I say its delish enough?"}
{"text":"Very friendly, nice atmosphere, and great sandwiches. Good beer, cider, and wine selections. I hope they expand their options for sides."}
{"text":"Poor management...Me being a 30 yr old women was questioned by the manger about my age to get a glass of wine. Took my id and stared at it with his iphone flashlight for 3 mins. Very awkward. And terrible customer service. I asked for sweet wine, and the manager came out with  something totally different. Loved the the waitress but poor management."}
{"text":"Always offered deals.  Great smells.  Good timing on call ahead and pickups.  I think the rent must be ridiculously high around these parts as several place can't make it and close within months.   Hopefully, Rooney's will return. P.S. I don't know how Google had notice or put up their notice of this place closing sooooo soon. Like, Google posted it within hours of the restaurant not opening their doors. WTheck~"}
{"text":"This was a forgettable experience. I got the Italiano. The rosemary focaccia was dry as a bone and the tomatoes, in late summer when they should be at their best, were mealy and underripe. The meat was good.  My wife got the QC Gobbler, which I had a bite of. It was tasty, but the bagel on which it comes should be toasted or grilled or something.  The employees were half asleep. When we walked in at around 1:30 on Saturday afternoon we were the only ones in there, but c'mon...show a little life.  Their beer selection, of which I did not partake, was sorely lacking. Way too many commercial macrobrews and too little variety.  This is like a sterilized, poor imitation of Common Market if that's what they were going for. My wife liked the \"grandma chic\" decor, so there's that.  I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Ah, what can I say about Rooneys... Oh I know PASTRAMI! BEST PASTRAMI IN CHARLOTTE! want it piled high, NY stacked? They'll do it! It'll cost you about 12.90 ask for the Dave's NY STACKED, worth every penny! At night try their tappas. There formage atrois flat bread is amazing! Lamb meatballs, and there Gyro Burgers hit the spot too! Nice outside patio or relax inside. Great selection of Beers, Wines and specialty sodas! I live right next to it and I'm a huge foodie. Eat there more now, because of the PASTRAMI!"}
{"text":"Super cool little place! Delish deli style sandwiches, def try the basil chicken salad wrap. Wine by the glass or bottle, beer, and great atmosphere. Super casual little gem with a great deli!"}
{"text":"I am going to make a bold claim but I think Rooney's can back it up. I may have found the best happy hour deal in all of Charlotte. We went on Saturday at 5:45 and everything was half off! Okay not everything just bottles of wine and their whole menu. So for me that translates to everything is half off.  Rooney's has had a bit of an identity crisis since they've opened. First they were a sandwich shop with some convenience market items. Then they started doing dinner with the metal shelving still surrounding the customers. Now they still have some shelving in the back but it is threaded with burlap and completely hides the sandwich bar. Whoever did that - genius. It really adds to the atmosphere. Their new set up is perfect.   Back to the happy hour deal - the whole menu is half price from when they open for dinner (4pm) until 6pm, every single day. Bottles of wine are half off Tuesday and Saturday. We essentially had a Saturday night out for a steal and I can see us making the most of this deal regularly.  We started off with the charcuterie board which was enormous for just the two of us with several types of meats and cheeses that were all delicious. Then we tried the prosciutto brie crostinis which had warm brie on the bottom and then was layered with prosciutto and standard bruschetta toppings. Though it was a little messy to eat I would definitely get it again! We also tried the bistecca which was okay. The mashed potatoes were well seasoned but I would have liked more flavor from the steak or the sauce (or both).   The service was excellent and with everything half off (making the bulk of their menu $4-$6) I would be hard pressed to say anyone in the queen city has a better deal."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. Wife got turned down for a drink when we were were seriously sober.  Even worse is they just disappear and can't even tell us that to our face.  Ayrsley is over priced and over rated and don't go to this place. Too many other great options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great place for the neighborhood. I live in Ayrsley and this is a wonderful addition. The WABiT was delicious. Can't wait to try the QC Gobbler!"}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers of mine, and I honestly wasn't super excited because I'm not a huge fan of the deli meat sandwiches, but my coworkers wanted to go so we did.  I decided to get the build your own sandwich. I got ciabatta bread with chicken, lettuce, banana peppers, balsamic vinaigrette, and tomato.  I assumed that the chicken was just going to be the sliced deli meat but it was actually grilled chicken and it tasted really fresh and delicious!  The ciabatta bread was warmed up perfectly and was so fresh and delicious!   The sandwich was amazing!  It went way above and beyond my expectations and I loved it!  I ate the entire sandwich and it was really filling too!  The staff there is also very friendly and very fast too!  They also have a bar there too which I wouldn't expect at a sandwich shop.  I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I call this place our new hidden gem! Great wine selection, great tapas and great flatbreads! It has market in the name but don't let that fool you! It's got a great menu and ambience! Doesn't deserve bad reviews."}
{"text":"I used Rooney's a couple of months ago to cater my wedding reception, and they were amazing from start to finish. They stayed in constant communication with me, making sure things were communicated and organized. It was a massive help on the wedding day with so much other things going on. They got creative and added some incredible meats and cheeses to the spread, and our guests absolutely loved it. If you need someone to cater, and you want to wow your guests - you need to consider these guys. Top Notch all the way."}
{"text":"I had lunch here about a month ago and was enamored with the space - small, hip, comfortable and charming. Had an AMAZING sandwich (after all if you're gonna make a sandwich make it damn good) and planned to come back. Tonight, bf and I left intending to have dinner at Portofino's, but opted for tapas at Rooney's instead. Across from Piedmont Social House and next to Carolina Beer Temple, we could listen to the live music on the lawn without the crowd. We were starving - their menu is small but very well done. We ordered Asian lettuce wraps with three dipping sauces - very, very good, will definitely get them again. We also had prosciutto and Brie crostini with tomato and basil - my fav. The crostini was crusty toasted but not tear your mouth hard and the Brie was creamy, the prosciutto fresh and flavorful. We also had the lamb meatballs - with fresh marinara delicious, hearty and just the right seasonings. Because we weren't stuffed with a huge plate of sides and take home boxes, we splurged on dessert - key lime pie cheesecake and strawberry shortcake cheesecake; both seemed homemade and were yummy, not sure which I enjoyed more! Limited but just right import, domestic and wine list, good selection of flatbreads and other items I plan to return and try; service was on par and friendly as well. Don't miss Rooney's - in a sea of bar menus, cheesy wing places, Chinese delivery, BBQ and sushi, Rooney's Market is EXACTLY what we needed in this part of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We took our foodie group to Rooneys and loved it. We have been back several times. The flatbreads are always good. The lamb sliders were juicy and mouth watering. The white bean dip is so good with the pita triangles."}
{"text":"Look at Common Market, Rhino Market, or any other provisions market. You HAVE TO hit the three buckets: coffee, beer, and deli. They're serving Kona coffee on drip. Where is the Enderly (Charlotte), the Parliament (Charlotte), the Counter Culture (Durham). The deli closes early (2PM). The three sandwiches I've had have been lackluster. They don't have a breakfast menu, just a build-your-own. How about a few breakfast standards? Burrito, sandwiches, etc. Beer wise, they don't venture out too far. Some local 4 packs and a few NC beers, a rather disproportionate mix of German-style beers, but nothing crazy. Only four coolers dedicated to beer. There aren't any taps either (maybe they're getting something soon?). This place has potential, but they need to use some better vendors, get some taps, and re-visit how they're running their deli."}
{"text":"I'm so excited I finally tried this place! We went for dinner and got a bunch of different tapas and they were all amazing! Ayrsley and Steele Creek have really been lacking in good local restaurants so I'm really happy to have this great addition to the neighborhood. All flatbreads and dips are half off on Saturdays from 4-6 which is a great deal. We got the Garlic Shrimp, the Bruschetta, the Whipped Feta and Roasted Red Pepper Crostini, the Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates, the Prosciutto and Arugula Flatbread, the Bacon Apple and Brie Flatbread, and the Lamb Meatballs. Everything was delicious and there were so many other things on the menu that I wanted to try. My only small complaint is that there was no cider on the menu. They did have a handful of craft beers on tap. Please come support this great restaurant! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with coworkers. The deli counter was disorganized and inefficient. We arrived around 11:45 and they didn't even have all their lunch ingredients prepped (salad dressing wasn't ready and had to be made while we waited). Everyone was very friendly, but it seemed like no one knew what they were supposed to be doing.   We sat at the tables to eat, which are a bit small to fit four people around. This place is also a market (which I imagine will be convenient for residents of the nearby apartments and guests of the hotels). They might want to consider what market items they place on the shelves that face the dining area. We had to sit and look at boxes of tampons while we ate.  They have pasta and sauce from Pasta & Provisions in the fridge, so locals might like to stop in to pick that up for a quick \"home cooked\" meal. They have beer, too, so there's that.  My group agreed that we probably won't go back. With so many other choices in the area, this doesn't make it to the top of our Friday work lunch locations list."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place in the Arysley area and stumbled on Rooney's. Its a nice place. We've been here a few times, it has a good, eclectic menu. We had a series of different appetizers once. They were all very good. Another solid option for this area. It doesn't have the feel of a full blown, sit down restaurant, but more of a tapas type place. great place to come have a beer, glass of wine and some small plates."}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm so thrilled my neighbors invited me for our \"girls night out\". Jeff (bartender/server) was amazing with suggesting wines as well as tapas.  Tyler (Chef/GM) came out to speak to us as well as receive feedback. I'm so happy we have this fabulous place closer to home without venturing downtown. Food, we had 4 tapas, 2 flatbreads, and 1 \"for the table\" so many flavors and fabulous creations. A little hidden gem that should be a staple for everyone."}
{"text":"Hmmm.. where to start?! I have oh so many great things to say about this place.First may i add the ambience is everything for such a simple concept.Cool how they have the inside almost set up like a convience store/market and theirs a section with wine bottle selections on a wine rack as well. It's a part facing the outside that from the outside looking in with the curtains draping and customers drinking wine i almost thought i was in Mikonos,Greece for a slight moment! The staff was more than generous and very informative. We learned that at 4pm they serve tapas plates and it turns into a happy hour spot. So me and my friend we went today for lunch around lunch  hours so the menus are different from their later hours. I had the greek flatbread with the street tacos everything was yummy and of coarse i indulged in the butterfinger brownie which was amazing as suggested from the young man at the register and he didn't lead me wrong. Im re visiting for the happy hour so i can try some of the tapas plates. This is like a cool relaxing spot most definetly while its warm and the sun is still out nice little view and i love the patio with the chairs in front with draped curtains something so simple looks so elegant . Great place to take a date as well if you're getting to know each other definetly check this place out guys!"}
