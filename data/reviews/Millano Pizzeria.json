{"text":"It started at 12:56 am and got the munchies so I ordered a calzone and 2 salads. First my card got charged then 5 mins later I got another charge for more. Third my food arrived 20 mins late. Last but not least there was a huge lump of something in my ranch. The calzone was alright. Prob won't order here again"}
{"text":"Good option for late night munchies! The wings are HUGE & the chicken fingers were delicious as well. Big portions for the price. Only thing that could be better were the fires. Because the styrofoam didn't have any holes, the fries were completely soggy upon arrival. But either way, I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"This owner is absolutely awful.. yelling at his staff for serving the bar employees that have been his ONLY business for over 3 hours. Then he didn't even have the ingredients to make what we ordered which was on the menu. This place is a joke and the owner is in for a rude wakening"}
{"text":"Freaking amazing!!! I got the Gondola with meatballs and japs, eggs over easy. The dough was so soft, so flavorful. My husband had the small Stromboli and it was huge!  He said it was the best one he'd ever had. I would suggest getting an extra container of marinara because it only came with one. We will definitely order again!  Used Uber Eats and it was great."}
{"text":"The wings are in point, french fries are the good ones. I ordered delivery in post mates and everything was"}
{"text":"This food is great I have been ordering from here for months and just recently the food has gotten a lot better both in the afternoon and at late night but all good food I ordered a large pizza 2 topping for 10.99 a Philly cheese steak and chicken Caesar salad from my girl everything was delicious and their wings oh my God so delicious
 I will recommend anybody visiting needing  some good food or anyone local"}
{"text":"This place was not bad at all! Ordered through Postmates for some midnight meal. Got the white pizza, onion ring and Caesar salad. Pizza came cold, but that's expected since it took 1 hr for delivery through postmates. Warmed it up in the microwave for 30 seconds and it was great. Onion was delicious and managed to stay crispy. Caesar salad was simple, romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese and standard Caesar dressing. They got it right and it tasted decent.  

I read the other reviews after I already ordered the food. So far so good, no food poisoning yet, so they can keep their 4 stars."}
{"text":"Do not ever eat here. I ordered food for delivery and the order took 2 hours to get to me the pizza was cold. When I called to check on the order they said they had a new cook and he could not get to dough not to stick. I was fine will all this and even with it taking so long. I understand stuff happens. When my food got got here my salad was wrong and they gave me a hard boiled egg with a shell on it in my salad. Every slice of pizza was cut different. From huge to a tiny skinny piece. I spoke with the manger he offered to bring me another salad I told him I didn't want it and wanted a refund. He told me to hold on while he spoke with the owner the owner told me if I wanted a refund I had to bring the food back to them. I honestly wish I could give them negative stars. I never complain but this place is so out of line I hope they change something or get shut down.  I ended giving the food to my dogs. They seem to like it. And to top this all off I just open the egg and it was rotten."}
{"text":"The salads are beyond amazing! I always get the Caesar and Greek salad from here. Very fresh and tasty! Also ordered a mushroom pizza and absolutely loved it! Out of all the times I've ordered never have I once been disappointed."}
