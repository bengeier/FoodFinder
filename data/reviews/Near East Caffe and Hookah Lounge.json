{"text":"They don't seem to wash their hookahs, the bases were covered in grime and one on the counter had water in it and it had fuzzy mold all in it! We got blue mist but couldn't taste it because the hookah was so dirty and the hoses were old and needed replaced we got another one made because we complained the same thing happened again! We also got particles in the back of our throat from a dirty hose..nasty!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!! Sad because this place use to be really nice like 3 years ago"}
