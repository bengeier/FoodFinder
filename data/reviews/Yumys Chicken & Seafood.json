{"text":"I visited the restaurant on a friends recomendations and was delighted with the taste specially sandwich was real yummy,an the price is really cheap compared to kfc and popeyes.later I ordered food for 25 people for our office party and it was great now almost everyone from my work place goes there for food.
Good work keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Zero star unfortunately there is no option for zero star. Wrost experience ever. I bought a chicken sandwich which I found it was uncooked and show it to them. One of the employee came forward and argued even the son of owner came and gave me reason that his fryers at 350 c and can't be uncooked without looking at the uncooked sandwich... surprised with their most stubborn nature towards customer...
Not willing to go there anymore even employer don't know what customer service is..."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Uber Eats, decided to give it a try instead of Popeyes. It was a rip off version of Popeyes and the food was very bland. 

If you're craving chicken and happen to be in Scarborough, go to Popeyes instead or even Wendy's, you'll thank me later."}
