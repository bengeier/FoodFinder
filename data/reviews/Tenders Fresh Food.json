{"text":"The food here can be hit or miss, as a few times my chicken tenders were undercooked. Shakes are really delicious."}
{"text":"Used to be great but the food gets saltier and saltier with every visit. Staff is great however"}
{"text":"Awesome quick cheap...they actually overload you on fries which is something you don't find...always a great place to stop for lunch"}
{"text":"For what it is the food is excellent and the line moves fast, the downside is the menu is pretty limited. I wouldn't order a shake again but for the most part a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The best salads and green tea too! Friendly staff. A good value and healthy choice. I wish there were more of these around, I could eat there almost every day!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a very simple restaurant with a simple fresh menu. The prices are the same as fast food, but higher quality food"}
{"text":"A favorite go to spot for fast casual food. Chicken tenders and fries are the best, and homemade sauces especially honey mustard are fantastic. They have expanded their menu to include salads and other sandwiches since they started."}
{"text":"The saddest part about moving was saying goodbye to my friends. The second saddest part was saying goodbye to Tenders. Hands down the best chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches I've ever had. They've got pretty good milkshakes too. And don't get me started on their vast array of sauces. I could drink the creamy garlic sauce. Personally, I like their fries as well but you don't go their for them. You go their to have your mind blown by some awesome chicken.

On top of the great food, they've got phenomenal service. If you have to wait for more than 5 minutes, they give you a free shake coupon. If you're a Davidson student and you've never been to Tenders, you're doing it all wrong. I don't care if you have a 4.0, not going to Tenders should be a grounds for failure."}
{"text":"When my family needs food fast we know we can go to Tenders. We have NEVER had a bad experience at tenders. The service is great and fast and I hope you all stick around for a while!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was a great one. We used the curb side pull up service. Pulled up ordered and our food was out to us in less than 5 min! Chicken tenders were juicy and crispy, fries were shoe string cut and nice and crispy . The sweet heat sauce was excellent! We will be back."}
{"text":"Who needs chic fila!  Tenders is the best. Love their tenders and nuggets with the best house recipe honey mustard ! I love their support in the community as well."}
{"text":"apples & toffee are soooo good!! Sweet garlic sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"The kids love it.  Great food.  Limited menu (that's the point).  Friendly, very courteous and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good strips and milkshakes.  Worthy of the trip."}
{"text":"Really quick service. Food was great and zucchini fries were fantastic - could make a meal out of them!"}
{"text":"There is no other place like this restaurant. I bring people from out of town, and they aren't expecting much, but end up leaving with a smile on their face...Happy Hour milkshakes also.."}
{"text":"When they say \"fresh,\" they mean it. The chicken fingers are never frozen. Never. Frozen. I don't think I've ever had truly fresh chicken fingers before. You can actually see people flouring and dusting the chicken in the back. I can't eat chicken anywhere else anymore. No KFC, Applebee's, Popeyes, or Bojangles comes close to this Mecca of fried deliciousness. And if you want to pretend To be healthy, they have zucchini--deep fried and slathered in Ranch dressing. There is no better way to consume a vegetable. The only downside is the price, but there's a trick--order kids meals to go. You get twice the sides and drinks for the same price as a single adult meal. Shh!"}
{"text":"A real chef, delish chicken fingers, killer honey mustard and the coolest soda machine around. All that real food foe less than a greasy burger meal."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Gets very busy at lunch so prepare to wait in a line but also know it is worth it! Never had chicken tenders this good. Milkshakes are awesome too! If the weather is nice they have great outdoor seating options."}
{"text":"Love the Buffalo Bleu sandwich!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I started coming to Tenders when it first opened.  I never tire of eating chicken.  Everything I've had here is good,  the service is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable.  Most of all, everything is super fresh.  Have only had good experiences here!"}
{"text":"My mama took me here for lunch yesterday.  It was a beautiful day so we headed up to Cornelius to check out the Swaney K-9 dog park at Ramsey Creek.  Then we went swimming.  So we were both pretty tired and hungry!  

Tenders was really close by and on the way home.  The set up made it sooooo easy for us to have lunch together.  You can pick up the food from the drive thru, which accommodates many cars at once.  However, there was a spot right by the door so my mama left me in the car with the windows down and went to the counter to order. (Don't worry, I was fine, it was only 81-degrees and it was breezy and overcast.  She could see me through the window the whole time she was in line!)

The service is so well organized and so quick that she was out lickety split with our order.

The outside area is really big.  There are picnic tables in several areas -- both concrete and grass covered surfaces.  It was raining out but we stayed nice and dry under the ample umbrellas.   I chose a grassy area under a tree.

I had my kibble while mama ate her tenders & fries.  It must have been VERY good for her to be able to go that long without paying attention to me.  

She did let me try some of the chicken from the tender, which was so juicy and -- yes -- tender.  I tried a french fry also and it was so perfectly seasoned and also tender.

I have a feeling this will become a regular stop for us.  Woof!"}
{"text":"I have never had chicken tenders this soft in my life! It felt like it melted in my mouth. The fries were tasty and they pack a whole lot of them in the container. We went to the drive thru and they came out super quick to get our order! I would like to try more of their menu items next time."}
{"text":"Tenders keeps things simple, and sometimes simple is good. There are three main choices - chicken tenders, a chicken sandwich or a chicken salad. It's tough to top the quality for the price. With a Yelp check-in deal, you can get three tenders, fries and a beverage for $5. The tenders are fresh and delicious. The fries, though sometimes too salty, are fresh cut and tasty. This isn't fast food; it's good food fast."}
{"text":"Just the best chicken and fries you will find. Consistently delicious. Always friendly service. I always go when in town."}
{"text":"Great,  inexpensive place to eat.  I get food here for my staff meetings,  as most everyone can find something they like.  Nothing fancy,  just quality food,  fast."}
{"text":"Very good chicken sandwich, better than the standard main stream McDonalds' etc. pre-formed chicken pucks.   Fresh cut fries too!  Homemade slaw is very good.  Milkshakes standard machine made.  Too thick and not much taste.  The salad is good with interesting dressing, and fresh greens.  Topped with grilled chicken, it's first class.  For decent food fast, this is the best.  Before they franchised, they were noticeably better though."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders--hands down! Always crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with high quality white meat. The dipping sauces are awesome. You have to try the sweet heat, buffalo, and honey mustard. Yum! The milkshakes are great too."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing quality. Always come for lunch, because the service is quick plus the Lowes discount. The new cookies are a great addition to the menu. I can't speak for anything outside of the 3 piece tenders meal because that's all I get."}
{"text":"Amazing.  The food was fresh and ready in less than fifteen minutes with a line out the door. I work in the service industry and was very impressed with the service and unrushed presentation.  Only reason not 5 stars was the dressing. .i know the caesar is made fresh but the chunk of anchovy i found really turned me off. Less is more when making caesar! All in all a great experience but will not be eating the caesar salad anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely fantastic! Every time we drove by this place, the parking lot was packed. My husband and I decided to give it a try when our family was in town. Wow! Get ready to taste the best chicken tenders you've ever experienced! Additionally, the homemade sauces are incredible and the owners let you try as many sauces for free as you would like. What is most impressive is the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the overall fun and efficient dining experience. We are sold! Chic-fil-a has nothing on this North Carolina classic!"}
{"text":"Very pleased on my first visit...had driven by many times and noticed the full parking lot, so thought it must be good. It was...had the 3 tender dinner with fries and iced tea...very satisfying."}
{"text":"If I could give this place six stars, I would.   The food is fantastic!   All fast food places should be THIS good.   It is very clean, the food is quick and the prices are reasonable.   And Tenders is one of the few places that does southern sweet tea right.    Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The tenders were awesome, upset I tried to be healthy and ordered a salad. Stick with the tenders and you won't go wrong.
Tasty, juicy and very fresh, seasoned to perfection, unfortunately I had to steal off hubbies plate to avoid my pitiful bagged, wilted lettuce."}
{"text":"The food is very good and they have expanded their menu which they needed to do.  Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Great spot for Milkshakes!! They have a simple menu but its quality.. Long story short, burgers, fries, tenders and chicken sandwiches.. I always see groups of kids there after sporting events.. Cool joint.."}
{"text":"29 minutes for three milkshakes: sorry, but nothing on their menu is worth that wait.  We were the first car at the drive thru and it was almost 10 minutes before anyone took our order.  The chicken is good, milkshakes are decent, but almost 30 minutes for a drive thru order is inexcusable."}
{"text":"When they first open I found them a bit more impressive.  I feel like their Chicken though large in size sometimes is greasy.  The fries have change a few times since they opened and are not back to the quality that they serve at 131 Main. At one point they were exactly the same.  Please understand you are going to Tenders for fast food.  It is not going to be Gourmet, but it is good for what it is.  A great Milkshake and Fired Boneless Chicken.  I do not recommend the Salads, this is not their specialty by any shape or form. I do though recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The best fast food chicken around! Not sure if they still do, but created & owned by 131 Main, which means all fresh not frozen. Great sauces & milkshakes, quick service and very clean."}
{"text":"Tenders has become my favorite quick bite restaurant. We moved into the area over 2 years ago and avoided this place because of it's simple appearance.  Eventually we discovered the team was the same behind 131 Main so we gave it a shot and were not disappointed. I think I went twice a week the first few months. 

This place is a great stop for summer months in-between lake or pool days, and the portion size does not disappoint. The deal on their party platters is amazing for tailgating or get togethers.

Be sure to like them on Facebook, they do contests from time to time, and my wife won a $50 gift card carving a Tenders pumpkin. 

The menu is small, so don't expect a lot of options, but expect to love all the choices there.  Shakes are delicious, and bonus points for being the only restaurant I have ever been to that gives you a super wide straw so your not fighting the milkshake the whole time. 

I won't knock them a star for it, but they use to have a pork chop sandwich that was AMAZING, and then it was replaced by the not as good for me, but still tasty, Thanksgiving Day sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Service is great. Workers behind counter always a pleasure to order with. Food is per paired fairly quick. Chicken tenders are my fav! SHAKES ARE AMAZING!! A++"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and wonderful shakes. The chocolate  peanut butter shake is the best. Will definitely recomend."}
{"text":"For fast food, it's hard to beat Tenders. Great chicken sandwich, great price -- not sure who can top it for value."}
{"text":"I love tenders! I love his fresh everything is and their homemade honey mustard can't be beat. The tenders and the chicken sandwich are delicious, I love how fresh the lettuce and tomato are on the sandwich, since most fast food places are not. Fries are good too. I also enjoy the apples and toffee sauce for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Does one thing and one thing very very well.  The chicken tenders are as good as it gets.  Get some with a bottle of Cheerwine and you have the best (cheaper) lunch.  I don't suggest sitting in the back however, there is no ventilation and it can get a little smelly in the heat.  Sit inside the main area or outside."}
{"text":"Owned by the same people as 131 Main in Cornelius, Tenders doesn't use freezers either. All of the food is fresh. Everything at Tenders is good; I tend to get something different every time. The service is good and fast and the touchscreen drink machines are an extremely nice touch. The milkshakes are also heavenly and are half priced from 2-4pm every day."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic, especially the sauces. The chicken is so moist and tender, and crunchy on the outside. This is my favorite fast food spot, we never go to McDonald's anymore."}
{"text":"Great chicken tenders. The buffalo bleu dipping sauce is of the gods. I'm not big on heir milkshakes though. They are good, but are way too thick."}
{"text":"Not sure what the obsession is with this place. To me it is average chicken tenders, below average fries, at a high price."}
{"text":"Limited menu and they do it very well. Consistently good. Same owners as 131 Main, so they are striving.

I really do not like the atmosphere though; it's like being inside a gym bathroom. There is signage pointing to the same area: \"condiments\" and \"restrooms\" -- the proximity makes me queasy. It can get crazy busy with families and as a consequence the inside can get dirty quickly. They have one of the newer Coke machines with all the American product offerings, which is just too much fun. 

Recently had their take-out tenders at a birthday party and I got to taste how really good they were without all the typical frenzy of eating there."}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders ever !!! blueberry Cole slaw, the turkey sandwich(fried or grilled) with cranberry sauce... Oh my goodness...Love them !!! the Cranberry Oatmeal Cookie,,,Yummie !
Oh yes I'm a Big Fan of Tenders.."}
{"text":"This place is actually incredible. Chicken tenders and fries are amazing as well as the nuggets. Huge portion. I actually get the kids size now because even that is big enough. If you're a sauce person you will be in heaven. Spicy Sriracha, garlic ranch and honey mustard are amazing. It's greasy food but if that's what you're looking for its a must try"}
{"text":"A great place to eat but it has to be the coldest place has well. You had to eat your food really fast because they keep it sooo cold in there."}
{"text":"Had my first trip to Tenders today -- delicious chicken fingers, fries, dipping sauces and apple slices. But seriously -- the children in this place made me want to pull my hair out. They were everywhere, screaming, being tickled by adults who should be shot. It was a cacophony and made us want to run screaming.  

How did I live up this way for 3 years and not try this joint? Part of it is that it looks a little redneck-ish from the road. I had no idea until recently that it is owned by the same group that runs 131 Main, one of our favorite restaurants. So, that made it something we were a little more adventurous with. But the children... dear God... the children...

I agree with others that the one drink machine, the sort of sterile environment, and the large numbers of people (and children!) hanging all over the place at 2:00pm on Saturday make it a place I will probably only visit on off hours, or to eat in my car. Thus the 3 stars, even though the food deserves 4. Great tender chicken!"}
{"text":"For my job we are out and about all over Charlotte and Huntersville. I bring my lunch most days and every time I bring my lunch my coworkers choose Tenders! It looks good every time, but today was the day that I actually got to try it out! Let me tell you.. I was not disappointed! 

The fries are the skinny fries (which are the best in my opinion) and were hot and tasty! I got the 3 tender basket and it filled me up. The Tenders are crunchy and the breading actually has some flavor!! They have a special seasoning where the cup lids are and if you want some extra flavor with a little kick out that stuff on your food! There are House made sauces and I highly recommend the creamy garlic and the mi eat mustard!! The guys I work with usually get the 4 or 5 piece tender combo and it fills them up. 

We usually get here around 12:30 and the line can get pretty long. The staff usually moves pretty fast, but if the line stretches back into the seating area you are looking at a wait of anywhere to 8-15 minutes for food. Today we got here around 11:50 and there was no line! 

They have half priced milkshakes starting at 2pm (I'm not sure when that ends). We haven't been able to be here at that time but I've heard the shakes are tasty!! Definitely worth the stop if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"SOOOO good! Tenders were perfectly fried, fries are delish and the shakes are even better. Can't wait to go back. Def worth the trip up from CLT."}
{"text":"Great fast , cheap chicken fingers  and good fries"}
{"text":"Great food and company. They have been great about supporting our school with events and dine out nights. The food is good and a casual easy environment. Parking can be tight and the location is in a tricky area. However, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Service is always excellent and fast. For fast food this place is always a good option. Homemade fries and tenders! The sandwiches are pretty good to. If you haven't been give it a try!"}
{"text":"LOOVE Tenders!  This place is always immaculately clean, the wait staff is SO nice, and their Chicken is GREAT."}
{"text":"The one started the entire PDQ franchise craze, the original Tenders is an amazing place to stop for lunch. Fresh hand battered chicken tenders, amazing fries and sauces, and a great variety of shakes and treats. One of my absolute favorite destinations in Huntersville. Try going between 3-5 in the afternoon and get a shake for half off. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It works and is very popular.   Quick service, inexpensive for the amount of chicken and fries....great deal"}
{"text":"Better than any other chicken place, hands down. The chicken is reliably delicious and there is a wide, diverse selection of sauces with which  to pair. Zucchini fries are my favorite side, but next time I'm gonna try the broccoli!  I've eaten here several times since moving to the Huntersville area 2 yrs, even used them to cater a party. Highly recommended. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"We frequent here. It's always good everytime!
Cheers to yummy chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food with great service - highly recommend to anyone with an appetite for chicken and fries. The crispy chicken sandwich is a must and comparable with chik fil a in quality.

Dont miss out on the shakes! The peanut butter chocolate shake is outstanding. This place purely quality based and a must when passing through North Carolina!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the appeal of this place, the fries are limp and greasy, the chicken tenders are cold and chewy, and the staff always has a bad attitude.  The only redeeming thing about this place is that they have some tasty dipping sauces.  I've tried this place at least 5 times, and have never walked away happy.  There are much better places around for my money."}
{"text":"I'll keep this quick.  Some of the best chicken tenders and milk shakes around.  I try not to throw these 5 star ratings around all the time but its damn good food.

This spot used to be called the Lakehouse a long time ago.  Now its turned into a better than your normal fast food kinda establishment.  This place revolves around their tenders, hence the name.  You can get the tenders on their own with sauces, you can get them on a sandwich, or you can get em on a salad.  Any way, they're great.  Perfectly crusted and seasoned superbly.  The fries are pretty spot on as well.

Ohhhhh, the milkshakes.  I rarely order them any where else, but if I find myself anywhere near this place at happy hour(half priced 2-4pm), I go for it.  Oreo is my weakness.

I'd have to say this is the best \"fast food\" around.  Fried food isn't something I try and eat more than once or twice a week but if I'm gonna eat it, I hope its here."}
{"text":"This is a brand new place from the owners of 131 Main. It's a fast food concept meant to compete with Chick-fil-a. It's at the corner of Westmoreland and Statesville Rd.

Food: Good chicken sandwiches and hand cut fries. I think the fries are the same type served at 131 Main. They also have chicken tenders and pork tenderloin sandwiches. The chicken sandwich had a nice, crisp batter on it. The sandwich comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo, onions, and pickles. They emphasize freshness (nothing frozen).

Price: Plan on spending around $7 for a sandwich, fries, and a drink.

Atmosphere: Very casual. This is a fast food place at heart. Right now it's in an old building, but plans are to build modern fast-food outlets as the chain grows. Right now, this one is it and it's unique."}
{"text":"Love this place, shocked I haven't yet been! What a great concept for \"fast\" food. Quite a varied menu as well with plenty of healthy salad options. The zucchini fries are delicious but make sure you
Get the creamy garlic homemade dressing to dip them in. The honey mustard is delicious also, love that they make all their sauces in house. The fried chicken tenders and sandwich are delicious- I can't speak to the grilled tenders since I haven't yet tried them. The regular fries are also delicious. Next time it's on my list to try a milkshake. Service was friendly and very prompt, and they have a nice seating area both inside and outside!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chicken tenders they were very, very, very good.  

Like the coke machine that has a ton of different coca cola products you can choose from (very nice touch).  

The shakes look great, would love to have some didn't on this trip.  

The place is very clean and well maintained.

What I didn't like - the fries.  For a place that has such a limited menu if you want 4/5 stars you better do those items right.  In this case, the fries were very disappointing.  Yes they are fresh cut, but they are sooo thin, not well seasoned and mine came out cold.  If the fries were better, would definitely get a 4th star for the quality of the chicken strips alone."}
{"text":"The place was packed and I was 4th in line for their \"drive thru\"....my food came out FAST!! The zucchini fries and chicken tenders were amazing. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tenders is awesome! I passed it a couple of times and I was intrigued by what it might be so I decided I would try it. The tenders are so good! The batter is delicious and perfectly crisp. They always come out fresh. The fries are fresh cut and so good! The milkshakes are a must. Affordable and certainly fast good. The environment is very pleasant and the service is impeccable. It's always crowded but that's a given for a great place."}
{"text":"Food is good and inexpensive. But I am a big fan of chicken tenders in general. I've had their tenders and a couple of their sandwiches. All the food I've had was good and it's fast. I like sitting out in their outdoor seating area during a nice day. The ambience is just like any other fast food joint and the scenery certainly leaves much to be desired but if you're looking for a quick inexpensive bite to eat, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Chicken strips = excellent, blow any other out of the water.  tender, white meat, very juicy and fresh tasting.  Fried coating is not overpowering and it is not oily. 

Sauces- must try them all, each is very very good

Fries- eh, they are so so, definitely something i get every time though

Milkshakes-only had the oreo and i dont know what it is but it was hands down the best oreo shake i have ever had! Im borderline obsessed w it lol

Great for the family, casual lunch or w/e...really love having places like this around, support mom and pop!"}
{"text":"I stopped coming due to the inconsistency of the salads and also the very slow service at the drive thru, they actually forgot my order.  I gave it another chance and I orderd two of the same salads. My husband's chicken salad had twice as much chicken on it then I had on mine. There is a recipe for this isn't there and are they not suppose to follow it? Disappointed"}
{"text":"Chicken tenders even grown ups will love! Really delicious sauces, all made in-house. Wish there were some healthy sides to go with the tenders -- if there were I would definitely be here more often! My kids' favorite area pick."}
{"text":"Loving the food and have since they opened.  But 2 stars because it's time to upgrade the facility.  Experiment done, it's a success.  Time for a larger, better organized and friendlier facility.  

I've been in there too many Saturday's where frankly, the overcrowding is making me second guess my returning.  I'm just saying.  Your product works, now lets see what you can do beyond the food and the one drink machine."}
{"text":"I was in the area for business and stopped in for a quick lunch.  I was pleasantly suprised at the quality of the food for a fast casual spot.  I went with the turkey sandwich which included cranberry sauce...yum!! And I went with fries as my side...no complaints at all! Service was super fast and I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is amazing!! Grilled chicken salad is my favorite. So much food!! Fast, super friendly service!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch. I suggest the grilled turkey sandwich.  If you want something fast casual then this is the spot. Get there before the crowd or use their 3 lane drive through."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders I've ever had. Staff is super friendly and restaurant is super clean. Honey mustard and garlic sauces are awesome!!! Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Had no idea this place was basically PDQ. Well, now I know. Everything is good, fresh and clean. Nothing better than a clean restaurant with great food. The ranch sauce and honey mustard is so good. Every once in a while they have a buy 25 get 25 free and we eat chicken tenders for 3 days straight."}
{"text":"OMG - love, love, LOVE these guys.  Could almost eat there every day.  Have eaten there 3 out of the last 5 days actually.  

First the Tenders themselves - very fresh, moist and flavorful.  Crust is crunchy and golden brown.  Almost drooled on my keyboard writing that... Genuinely better than any I've had anywhere - I mean anywhere on the planet.  

Fries - Good, but they are a sideshow to the main attraction - the Tenders

Shakes - Another great part of the experience.  I'm a strawberry fan, but I'm sure anyone who likes shakes is gonna lover these.  Try the seasonal flavor (Orange Creamsicle right now)

Soft Drinks - Coke products, except for the Sundrop and Cheerwine in a bottle.  Meh...

They are not directly off any I-77 exit - you'll need to exit on Sam Furr (Exit 25) or Catawba (Exit 28) and drive along Statesville Hwy to find them at the corner of Westmoreland and Statesville.  

Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Very good. Chicken strips and zucchini sticks were hot and yummy. Very good sauces as well. However, their strawberry shake with malt was the star of the show. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Their tenders are so much better than Chick Fil A and their fries are real good too. I always order to go since I'm not a fan of the dog rescue they had on the patio this past summer. I love finding good, cheap eats!"}
{"text":"I had a lot of trouble deciding between a four and a five.  I was hesitant to give a place dependent on frying a five  but it was so great otherwise I had to round up.
The place looks great just out of the road food architecture of the fifties.  There is even car hop service.  Beware, this place gets very busy and the parking lot gets really jammed making an accident seem very probable.  The lines of kids, teenagers, professionals and retirees move fast but are rather long.  Head there before noon or after 1:30 yo be sure you get a table.  
Lots of great chicken sandwiches and tender platters plus salads.  The sides are great tater tots, fries or zucchini fries.  Cool machines with hundreds if soda choices.  Homemade lemonade and absolutely fantastic milkshakes.  I can't wait to get back and hope my arteries don't.harden too much!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the chicken is great. If you haven't been to Tenders yet, go."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken tenders and fries. At times I feel the fries outweigh the chicken in quantity but the food is always filling. If you go there for lunch try to go around 11am because the closer you get to 12pm the busier it gets and waiting in line can be a little long."}
{"text":"Short and Simple...Tenders has the best chicken fingers in The Charlotte metro area.  We drive out of our way to eat here with the kids when we are in the Lake Norman area.  The milkshakes are excellent!"}
{"text":"I like th fact that on a busy day i can just drive right up and  get a salad and a fresh squeezed lemonade with real lemons in three mins. i don't like the other options on the menu....but handy on the fly."}
{"text":"I love the food at Tenders, especially their chicken tender salad and their milkshakes! The variety of sauces that they offer is great, I recommend the honey mustard personally. The only reason I knocked a star off is because it's rather pricey for some chicken. Whenever my fiancé and I go, it ends up being the price of a regular sit down restaurant instead of a more \"fast food\" establishment."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips in NC.  The fries are also really good with ranch.  I can't eat it all the time because it's super greasy in a good way but when I do it's awesome."}
{"text":"I like their chicken sandwiches and chicken fingers. Their fries are also pretty good too. But what is with the blueberry coleslaw? I ordered it thinking it would have a blueberry flavor/sweetness to it. But no; it was literally just coleslaw with a few blueberries thrown on top. And the coleslaw itself was very dry and bland. Anyway, I'll probably go here again, but until they improve the coleslaw, I'll stick with the fries."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Love grilled chicken salad, milkshakes, dipping sauces! They will make your sandwich with a lettuce wrap. Have yet to try one but that's how I eat my sandwiches, because gf bread tastes like boards. Don't miss a house made perfect lemonade, so good!! Always"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a former-Davidson grad who was back in town for a day and drove from South Charlotte to Tenders just for lunch - so I knew it had to be good.

When I was in the area, I made it a point to stop at Tenders for lunch.  I stopped on a Saturday around 11:30, and luckily made it there before the lunch rush.  Using my handy-dandy Yelp check-in special, I got a combo of three chicken strips, fries & a drink.  Oh and a sauce, made-in-house sauce.  Mmmm.

My order was up super-quick, so I got to nom those fries right away.  The chicken is pretty similar to Hubee D's but the fries were so much better.  I got the buffalo bleu sauce, and even though I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, the buffalo-ness (new word) made it delicious.

I will definitely go back if I'm around again to try more of what Tender's has to offer!"}
{"text":"Our go-to for delicious chicken tenders and fries. Caution: Their \"sweet heat\" sauce is highly addictive."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to the normal fast food. They have chicken and that's it. Fried and grilled, with fries or on a salad."}
{"text":"*drool* to just think about Tenders chicken. Juicy, tender, & flavorful. The lemonade is a perfect balance of sweet citrus."}
{"text":"If you are craving home cooking, this is your place. The chicken tenders always remind me of a family Sunday dinner. Flavorful and filling, you'll be happy to pull up to the table here."}
{"text":"Yes please! Any place that specializes in Chicken, is a place for me! My wife and I went around lunch time, because we saw they had a coupon on Yelp for checking in. So we took advantage! Luckily we got there before the lunch rush. We still had a tiny bit of a wait. While we sat down outside and ate, we just saw car, after car, after car pull in. This place is POPULAR!!! One of the coolest things, is they have the coke machine where you can customize your soda with a TON of different flavors! 

I went simple and got the chicken tenders and fries with their mustard. The tenders were pretty big! I could of used another 1 or two tenders, but the taste was so good, I wasn't disappointed. 

Biggest tip, show up BEFORE lunch, or AFTER lunch since this place gets slammed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. We have passed it many times and wanted to try it. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and zucchini fries. I hesitant getting the zucchini fries but they were delicious! On the other hand, the grilled sandwich seasoning tasted awful. Had to drown my sandwich in ketchup to try and get rid of the seasoning flavor. I was disappointed with the food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Consistently good chicken strips, sandwiches, and fries. Love the apples with toffee dipping sauce. One of our favorites in Charlotte. Missed being 5 stars because it's sometimes a little dirty."}
{"text":"Food is alright, but gets old kinda fast."}
{"text":"Chicken tenders are great. Always hot and juicy. French fries are great. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Does not come any better for pseudo fast food.  Great shakes, fries are not perfect but good.  The tenders are the best.  Only thing better would be if they opened a restaurant in Mooresville."}
{"text":"The chicken is very tender and juicy here. You'll immediately notice the difference between Tender's fresh food and fast food restaurants with deep freezers and warming bins.

Most of the stuff is made in house. They cut their own fries and make their own dips and salad dressings. They don't have a freezer. And they have healthy options for kids like grilled tenders and apple slices.

My personal favorites are the tenders because they're (actually) tender, juicy, and lightly breaded. The grilled and fried chicken sandwiches are also great and their grilled chicken Caesar salad is fantastic!

(I do wish they still had the pork chop sandwich, it was awesome!)"}
{"text":"This is an odd one. Only one that I know of although I don't know much so. :) As the nomenclature states, they have tenders here. I personally did not try them. I had a chicken sandwich. I went with my Mother one afternoon I believe on a Saturday or Sunday. There was hardly anyone there, which I don't mind because I'm somewhat impatient. The sandwich was very good. Ordering it wasn't as easy. I found myself looking all around at like three different menus, one left, one right, one down in front and I think there was another behind the cashier. I'm not a local to the area so maybe that's why it seemed odd. I would go back, just not in any hurry to."}
{"text":"Were nearby to Tender Fresh Food when on our way to Jetton Park. Family with picky two year old, yet everyone left satisfied. We ordered the chicken tenders with honey BBQ sauce, honey mustard and creamy garlic. All were delicious. They also offer tasty looking salads, milkshakes, and sides that rival Chick Fil A quality. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great buffalo chicken sandwich, tasty fries, and shakes! Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent chicken and fries. Always hot, fresh and delicious. They also have great shakes. Can get crowded in the afternoons especially the weekends. Way better than any fast food chicken place and about the same price. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is such a fun little drive up! Food is good, nothing fancy. But it's so fun and cute to do the 1950s drive up method and get your food brought out to your car!"}
{"text":"Each time I'm in the area visiting family I have to stop here. The tenders and fries are very tasty!!! I love how you can also choose unlimited dipping sauces. My niece and I once shared a cookies n cream milkshake and it tasted deliciously homemade. If you're new to Tenders, treat yo self and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love Tenders (and PDQ) - fresh, delicious \"fast casual\" food."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Consistently hot and fresh. None of the PDQs taste quite like the original. The zucchini fries and ranch are out of this world."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite \"fast casual\" restaurants I've been to! My go to is their Cali Club. The chicken on the sandwich is so good! I can't even explain it- super moist (sorry if you hate that word) and cooked to perfection. The fried turkey sandwich is also a good choice, but don't forget their sauces! They are all homemade and equally delicious. The parmesan garlic is delicious on anything and the honey mustard goes great on the cali club.

They also have ZUCCHINI FRIES! How many places serve zucchini fries? And every time they are super fresh and hot. They are a great alternative to fries and of course go great with the parmesan garlic sauce!

Lastly, the tenders. I mean this place is called TENDERS so you know their tender game is strong! They also have a $5 yelp check-in for the tenders meal that you cannot beat! They are delicious with the perfect amount of breading. 

Every time I'm in Huntersville Tenders is a must if I'm feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"The chicken is good and the variety of meal combos is very good. Plenty of fresh fries.
I ordered a 3 tender meal and was served a 4 piece. They told me they felt one of the tenders was on the small side. (I didn't think so) Was a very nice thing for them to do. 
The 4 stars is for a fried chicken tenders place not a \"real\" restaurant. Let's compare apples to apples.
One of the best things there is listening to others conversations while I'm eating, free entertainment"}
{"text":"We just love this place... Been going there since their free shakedown trials, and we keep going back. If \"anything\" is not to your liking, they comp you. Just great!

Fresh cooking, handmade french fries and absolutely great shakes - so thick they use a super-size straw! Gotta love a place like this."}
{"text":"!31 Fresh Concept  Carried to Fast Food

When 131 Main opened, the did not even have a refrigerator to demonstrate that everything was fresh, never frozen.  This is a fast food extension of the same by the same owners.

The food, while limited to basically chicken sandwiches and sides, is still outstanding. The freshness of the food and the quality of the service is outstanding. I know you are going to ask the question as to how service in a fast food can be outstanding but give then a try and you will find out."}
{"text":"Cheap fast and some of the best chicken fingers around! Def worth a try! I will say lunch is usually packed so be prepared. And ty a milkshake they are great"}
{"text":"Still a good place to get your chicken tender fix, though I miss the original breading they opened with for their tenders.   Excellent service, friendly, and great for kids and a lazy Sat afternoon visit.  

Dining area is a bit odd, bit maybe their franchise PDQ is better, which I haven't visited yet. 

A definite must for newbies!   

Ps-ice tea is rich and favorable!"}
{"text":"So we just stopped in here for a shake, but saw the fries, so ended up with fries and a shake. It just so happened to be happy hour, so we got the shake for half price!  Good timing (between 2-4). The chocolate shake was awesome, they give you a huge straw because it's pretty thick stuff. Taste like they use some hot fudge to make it. Fries are fresh cut and tasty. I didn't check the condiment station, but the fries would love some seasoning salt next time. Regardless, every last fry morsel was consumed. 

Service is worth-mentioning friendly. The condiments are on the way to the restroom and that whole area reminded me of a church basement gathering space, not sure exactly why. 

Next time we are up there, i'll be sure to stop and this time might even try the tenders."}
{"text":"Love Tenders!!! We love the fresh food and we love that they are dog friendly...because our dogs love fresh Tenders too!!"}
{"text":"I lived in huntersville for 3 years and love this place. I'm pretty sure the chef went from an executive chef position to making true hand breaded fingers and shakes. They do chicken fingers better than some places can make a 4 course meal. Lots of TLC at tenders.  I would recommend a 5 piece basket and a shake."}
{"text":"Great chicken tenders and fries!  I knocked a star off because they got 2 out of the 4 orders wrong but it probably more a 3 1/2 star rating.  My husband ordered tenders and fries, which I was jealous of.  My sons and I ordered fried chicken sandwiches.  They were not bad but they weren't as good as the regular tenders to me.  The milkshakes were DEE-licious!  The service was awesome and the employees are very friendly.  We will return.  

On a side note, this restaurant is no longer owned by the people who own 131 Main.  They were bought out by a group called PDQ a while ago.  They kept the name but that may be why the menu has changed as noted by some other reviews."}
{"text":"This is the best fresh chicken place around. The chicken tenders are amazing and their \"sweet heat\" sauce is awesome. If you haven't been here you must try it!"}
{"text":"So, born and raised in the south, Chic-fil-a has been a staple for my chicken nugget/strip/sandwich craving for as long as I remember. I have driven by Tenders countless times and decided to finally give it a try, and man do they do a good job at what they do. Simple menu...chicken tenders, a couple of sandwiches and fries...thats it. I got a 3 piece strip with fries must say that they were the best chicken strips I have ever had. Perfect seasoning of salt, pepper and thyme(pretty sure) with a light and crispy batter without being greasy. The chicken was still moist and perfectly cooked. The homemade sauces are awesome as well....sweet heat BBQ, chipoltle, creamy garlic and honey mustard. My fav was the sweet heat and chipoltle. Only reason I am not giving 5 starts is because the fries were a little over done for my tastes, but still hand cut and fresh. I'm sure they will be adding more locations, but in the mean time if you are ever in the huntersville/cornelius area and have a chic-fil-a craving, skip it and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior of the building fool you - this place is legit. 

Most come for the chicken tenders which are very good. Once I discovered the Classic Crispy Salad - it is now my go to meal. NOTE - have them toss the dressing in, and try the Honey Mustard. 

Another thing to try - Fresh made lemonade is always good."}
{"text":"Tenders is always good and always fast.  This was the first time they messed my order up but fixed it just as fast as I told them!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite summer spots to go to after a long day on the lake. The chicken is awesome and it isn't too over fried so it feels like you are actually eating chicken and not just grease covered fried chicken. Also, the fries are awesome. This is an awesome hidden gem that is good for groups and families."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good! I usually only give a place 5 stars if the value is just outstanding or the customer service just blows me away. Hence the 4 stars. Good service, good food, good price."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  My last visit was a couple of years ago, and I was impressed.  However, this visit was not a good experience.  You can claim fresh food, but if you cook it in old grease it will be bad. The first order of fries were cold and greasy. I went back and received fresh ones. They were hot and greasy, as were the chicken tenders. The old oil left a bad taste in my mouth. My dog was happy!"}
{"text":"Don't think that perfection can come in a chicken tender...well my friend you need to check yourself before you wreck yourself. Tenders are so awesome you will be floating on cloud 9 after your first bite. Sauces so good they will make the Pope jump through a stained glass window. And did I mention how nice the staff and service is here? You thinking about passing this place up....dont make that mistake!! Im a Tenders fan forever!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch.  Their chicken tenders are tasty!  I recently discovered the Buffalo Chicken Tender sandwich which I highly recommend.  My wife loves their salads.

Even though they always seem to be extremely busy they get the food out quickly and you are rarely waiting more than 60 seconds.  Their efficiency is impressive.

The place is pretty noisy otherwise I would have given it five stars.  

The outdoor seating is great when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"It's ok. The milkshakes are from a powder. Lemonade fresh squeezed at least. Salad is cheapest possible ingredients, mostly iceberg lettuce. Place looks a bit, let's say worn. Chicken nothing spectacular. Parking was good and customer service good."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tenders by a friend of mine when we first moved here.  Every time since then I have ordered their regular chicken tenders meal with fries, I love their fries and their chicken tenders were always pretty good.  But on my last visit to Tenders, I decided to be adventurous and get their crispy chicken sandwich.  OMG! Their crispy chicken sandwich is the best I have ever had anywhere!!! I love it and as I talk about it right now I am craving it!  It's the simplest thing, crispy chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mayo, but (for me) it's the perfect crispy chicken and the perfect amount of lettuce, tomato, pickles and mayo.  I love the fact that it is nothing like fast food chicken sandwiches, where the fast food places glob on mayo and give you one leaf of lettuce and one thin tomato, Tenders gives you a nice layer of lettuce, a thick cut tomato, a few pickles and just enough mayo to taste mm.... perfection!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place is 1000 miles from my house, I'd eat here every other day if not. Very limited menu but what they have is fantastic.  The home made sauces were amazing.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Don't get up this way to often, but when I do I try to get my chicken fix. I like it so much better than Chick Fil a. I give it 4 stars, but my wife did not like her grilled chicken salad. She was certain that bagged greens were used for the salad, and that the grilled chicken was flavored with garlic. Needless to say she discarded the salad and I purchased the yummy chicken tenders for her. All was right with the world once again.

If you dine between 2pm and 4pm drinks are 1/2 price."}
{"text":"I was not entirely impressed by anything that I've eaten from this place. The chicken is bland, the salads and sandwiches are quite a bore. Not sure why people are in love with this place. It's average at best!"}
{"text":"Delish !  Fresh, hot real chicken.  The Sweet Heat sauce is so good.  Shakes are the best!"}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders and service employees around! The only thing I would change would be their French fries. I feel that the fries could be slightly larger cut, and more crispy. Soggy shoe string fries are not the best. Great place to bring the family though."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has consistency. It only complaint I have is the preservative they add in the salad  dressing."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is quick...but there fries always seems to never be crispy, HOT, and fresh for it to be constantly busy."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh fries. Awesome milkshakes. Dog friendly on the outside patio. Definitely will venture back. Very large amount of chicken in honey butter chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Great, quick, affordable, high-quality food. We love right around the corner from Tenders, and they are one of our favorite go-to spots. Their fried chicken is great, both on sandwiches and in tender form. Their grilled chicken is juicy and tender, not dry like at some other restaurants. And their salads are fresh and crisp. Plus, their house-made sauces are TO DIE FOR, particularly the Creamy Garlic and the Sweet Heat. Their fries are fresh cut and tasty, though I tend to order mine extra, extra crispy. (I just like really crispy fries.) For dessert, get a milkshake. They are creamy and smooth and served with a larger straw so you don't get cheek fatigue from slurping too hard on a tiny straw. Also, they have a Coke Freestyle machine, so you get to have fun playing around with flavor combinations. Go to Tenders! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Chicken is extremely good, taste fresh and very flavorful. Fries are ok tad bit soggy imo. There needs to be a few more pieces of chicken on the salads for the 9 dollar price tag. Overall the best fast food you can get in Cornelius."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A watch out! I've been to this place twice and I love it! The service is fast and friendly and what I really love about them is......they're OPEN on Sundays!! 

Their chicken is so delicious and taste very fresh! Their fries are awesome and don't forget that honey barbecue dipping sauce! If you order their seasonal Banana Pudding milkshake you'll be thankful! 

Their prices are fair and if you check in they offer a 5$ value meal."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened...I live nearby and used to eat here 2-3 times a week for lunch/kids dinners.  I liked the idea of the new menu but they are obviously focused on cutting cost and the product is suffering.  A simple grilled chicken salad I would eat twice a week went from good to well below average - hard chicken kinda gross, less than half the ingredients and increased prices.  Focus should remain on quality...."}
{"text":"People LOVE this place.  I guess I had high hopes due to everything I heard, but was disappointed.  The chicken tenders had a nice crunch and seemed to be fresh, but not a ton of flavor.  I got a salad, and it looked pretty sad.  Not a lot of toppings, and the grilled chicken had a \"dirt\" flavor.  I know that sounds weird, but it's true.  I may go there for tenders again, but there's Chik-Fil-A up the street.  Yeah, I'm not a fast food fan either, but Chik-Fil-A isn't bad when it comes to their chicken tenders and nuggets!"}
{"text":"Tenders ain't your momma's fast food restaurant.

Brought to you by the owners of another Cornelius favorite, 131 Main, Tenders is a simple but delectable fast-casual restaurant specializing in fried chicken. While the menu selection doesn't get past fried or grilled chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, fries, and a selection of milkshakes, it more than makes up for it with it's finger lickin' good food. I usually go for the traditional chicken tenders combo, but have tried the crispy turkey breast sandwich as well. While fried food isn't the healthiest, Tenders offers all of their meals with grilled chicken if that floats your boat. Likewise, their chicken is never frozen, and their french fries are cut from potatoes daily. This should at least make you feel a little bit better as you indulge in some of the most succulent fried chicken you will ever taste.

Make sure to try Tenders' homemade dipping sauces. My friends and I swear by the creamy garlic, a more flavorful and zesty version of traditional ranch dressing. They also offer a honey mustard, BBQ, and sweet heat, a spicier version of their creamy garlic sauce. While not a big shake fan, I've had a few bites of my friends, and I can assure you they're quality. 

Hidden on their menu is the option to trade your french fries for sliced apples. Don't be fooled...these sliced apples are served with an absolutely scrumptious homemade toffee caramel dip that is out of this world. Not sure if it's healthy, but you will literally be scraping out the remains of this dip with your finger until every last drop of it is gone.

Perfect for a quick lunch while boating on Lake Norman or heading out with co-workers, Tenders is a welcome addition to the Cornelius area that is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty decent. I ate ate zaxbys the previous day and was way more impressed by their food."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken sandwich that I have ever had.  I was tempted to go up and get a second sandwich I was so impressed but I decided to try a milkshake instead....amazing!  I talked to the manager and he told me a little about the restaurant.  Everything is fresh...this makes a lot of sense because you can really taste the difference.  I wish I lived in North Carolina so I could visit more often.  Tenders will be a must do every time I am up in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The best tasting chicken strips. Real chicken, not \"ground up put together\" chicken. The buffalo blue cheese sauce it's outstanding. My personal favorite is the grilled chicken salad, served on a nice bed of mesclun type lettuces. The milkshakes are very tasty, and they always have amazing seasonal flavors."}
{"text":"The go to place in Cornelius if you have kids.  Tenders, amazing sauces, fries, milkshakes, and even salads for those who are so inclined.  We go for kids parties, afternoon milkshake celebrations (they have a milkshake happy hours ) and sometimes we sneak in for a snack without the little ones.  Tenders is the ultimate in comfort food and the staff/service is amazing."}
{"text":"Been here 2x, it seems busy all of the time, but the line moves fast!

Inside layout is open and bright!

My husband both got the 5 piece combo , comes with 5 chicken tenders, side , soda and homemade filling sauce.

I had the garlic sauce, my husband got the chipotle bbq-- we loved both and love that they are homemade.

My husband loves tenders more than I do. There is something about the chicken that tastes a little off to me, can't explain it , but both times I ate here same different taste that I cannot explain. I think it is the batter of the chicken that personally I don't love.

I do love the fries and slaw!! The blueberries in the slaw add a pop of freshness! 

We will be back to try their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Absolute best chicken tenders I've ever had.   Even the fries are the best!    Awesome sauces, and they are always very generous portions.  Anytime I want to treat myself to some good fried food, this is my go-to place.   Even their drink machine is a notch above the rest (one of those 100 combination types)"}
{"text":"Tenders is a local treasure. They have the best chicken strips:  lightly breaded, juicy, and wonderfully spiced. They make their own sauces, too. I love the honey mustard sauce.

I also like their chicken sandwiches. The sandwiches come with lettuce, tomato, and a thin bun, which I appreciated. 

Finally, try the blueberry cole slaw. It's pretty good and a nice substitute for fries."}
{"text":"Please, please, PLEASE go back to the original bun! The new pretzel like bun on all the sandwiches is too sweet and too much bread! Stick with what you've always done. The spicy chicken sandwich has changed as well..dripping in sauce and blue cheese. Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"It's everything you want in a fast food joint, except better. It isn't much to look at but the food is crave-worthy. I used to live in the Cornelius area and now that I have moved back to civilization (Charlotte), I have to make excuses to come up here just so I can have my grilled turkey sandwich. Tips: everything is good, 1/2 price shakes from 2-4pm, try the turkey sandwiches."}
{"text":"We have been going to Tenders for almost 7 years and it's great, fresh, fast food.  We go for lunch, dinner and through the drive through, depending on the occasion.  Definitely a staple that we visit at least once a week."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Real good chicken and fast. Very popular lunch stop for the working crowd in the area. Place can get busy, but they move through he rushes pretty quick."}
{"text":"Perfect fresh chicken tenders. Thin delicious fries. Honey mustard you'll keep coming back for. Thick (almost to the point of feeling guilty) shakes. Very tasty blueberry cole slaw. Go here on a sunny afternoon, order some delicious food and sit outside. Prices are not as cheap as regular bland chain fast food, but definitely worth it for amazing fast food.

This place is called PDQ elsewhere in NC. If you see that sign (like the one on Concord Mills Blvd.), it's still Tenders delicious food."}
{"text":"Restaurants trying to be all things need to take a lesson from Tenders. They do one thing- Tenders (duh!), but man do they do them well! My friend and I were starving one recent afternoon so we ordered 25 to split. We even got 10 free due to a promotion they were running! The fries are too soggy for my taste. It's the only thing keeping them from that elusive fifth star. 

The sauces will blow your mind, too. All fresh and packed with flavor. As an added bonus, we got our shakes at half price because it was happy hour (2-4). 

If you enjoy chicken tenders, you simply must try this place. Great food and fast service from friendly folks. What more can you ask for?

Tenders: A-"}
{"text":"Tenders grilled chicken salad is apart of my weekly repertoire. Consistently yummy and so so reasonable. Looooooove me some PDQ/tenders. (Excellent sauces too)"}
{"text":"Would love to give 5 stars. Love tenders! Their sanitation score is a 94 which is the reason for only 4 stars. Staff is friendly and efficient. Food is always hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Top three favorite places to eat in the world. Just came up from south of Charlotte. Fair prices too. $9.xx for 5 of the best tenders of all time, a ton of really good fries, and a fountain drink/tea. I'm a sauce person and they have a large selection of REALLY good sauces and don't charge you for them."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the prices seem inconsistent with the fast food mentality. I know they are affiliated with 131 Main, which may be the reason for the high prices. The tenders are ok but the fries always seem soggy to me. They have great milkshakes."}
{"text":"I like this place, they have really fresh food and it is so fresh that you have to be careful to not get burned as soon as you bite it!

I only have two problems with this place: they are always packed and they could have more soda machines. These new coke machines are great but gives people too many choices and have 2 kids in front of you choosing a drink and you are toasted! Well, at least the wait for the drinks help to cool off the food!"}
{"text":"This is the place that started it all for what is now the PDQ chain.  The chicken here is really juicy and flavorful, and you will never find processed, compressed meat glue nuggets.  These are clearly, recognizably fresh chicken breast.  Fries are fresh cut.  Salad dressings are over the top yummy, and the salads are large and very fresh.  Prices are great, as well.

For a change of pace, try the grilled turkey sandwich, which consists of an egg bun with an extra thick slice of wonderfully spiced turkey breast, a large wedge of iceberg, and a can-shaped slab of cranberry sauce.  It tastes like the day after Thanksgiving, but is available all year."}
{"text":"Just OK. Nothing special. Personally I thought the fries were way too greasy and the chicken was the same, if not less satisfactory, as a frozen pack of chicken tenders such as Tyson. Was really disappointed considering its a bit pricey & I had high hopes. The interior is retro and adorably set up and the overall the place was very clean and the staff was very attentive and kind- the food...meh."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem! If I am going to eat fast food, this is the place I go. The tenders are so good that I can't eat chicken tenders anywhere else anymore. It really is fresh every time. The milkshakes are old fashioned goodness!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken strips they were indeed fresh! A little pricey for a combo which totals to $9.00 for 3strips, fries and a drink, but luckily I used my Yelp coupon so my combo ended up being $5.00!!! I am so in love with th ranch sauce it's so amazing. I would definitely return only if it's in my budget."}
{"text":"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO WRITE DOWN SOMEONES ORDER.  Every time, EVERY time I have been through the drive through and ordered, the waiter or waitress does not write down what I order. Tonight it happened again, she even came back and asked what drinks I ordered.  Every single time, my order is wrong.  If they write down the order, it should not be that difficult.  This really makes me want to never go back!"}
{"text":"Don't need a tux, just a yen for some fresh, delicious chicken tenders that are always excellent."}
{"text":"Tenders is the bomb.  This is straight poultry, no beef here.  The chicken tenders are just that!  tender and crispy and tasty at the same time.  The menu is not chock full of options but what they do, they do well. Chicken sandwiches, crispy or grilled with all the toppings and fried turkey as well and they have salads now too.  You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches, the grilled chicken comes with a whole grain bun.  Same owners as 131 Main"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Super clean inside (almost on the sterile side), but can't go wrong for fresh chicken sandwiches"}
{"text":"Always fresh and consistent!  Great value for the money. This is a regular spot for a high quality affordable lunch. I love the 100 variety coke machines."}
{"text":"This place is to chicken tenders what In-N-Out is to burgers. Hands down, the best tenders around. Juicy. Big. Great flavor and only the smallest amount of well seasoned breading. Great fries - though they are sized for Polly Pocket and not human hands. That said, they are fresh, perfectly prepared and awesome w/malt vinegar. My husband really enjoys the pork sandwich though he does wish it were a tad bigger (well, he'd never say tad...or smidgeon...but you get the point).

Kids' meals are great and fresh fruit is offered as a side. These meals are great for kids or adults w/a smaller appetite. 

Like In-N-Out, the place is surgically clean and the staff is very friendly. My only complaint is that we drive 17 miles to get there!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken tenders and homemade sauces. Get there early, packed on weekends and during lunchtime!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place and so do I. Fresh chicken tenders and fresh cut fries. Yes, please. It's a great family friendly place with consistently good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Fresh food. Great prices. I usually get the 3 tenders meal. But the sandwiches and the salads are wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Let me start with this:  I HATE the word \"Tender.\"

For this review I'll pretend like this place is called \"Chicken Sandwiches.\"  While visiting my bestie in North Cackalacki, we were in desperate need of some good hangover food.  After a western shopping trip, we swung by \"Chicken Sandwiches\" to pick up some lunch.  Linzi was raving about this place even during my last trip down to visit, when we didn't have time to stop.  Although this is a fast food place, it does not have a drive-through.  It DOES, however, have a serve-yourself touch-screen soda station which offers A HUNDRED different selections of soda!!  We both went with the diet root beer, but the choice was a difficult one.  I could have stood and scrolled through that thing for an hour.  But I think the teenaged girl behind me was getting a bit impatient.

I followed Linzi's lead and got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich Combo.  I also go the garlic dip on the side.  Yum, Yum, and Yum.  Check in on Yelp here, and get a Chicken Strip Combo for $5 (originally $6.75).  The chicken sandwich was delicious and although the fries were a bit limp and soggy, dipped in the garlic sauce, I had nothing to complain about.  

This would not be an everyday event for me, if I had one near by, but definitely a great quick stop on one of those hangover days.  I took away one star due to the name.  \"Tender...\"  Ew."}
{"text":"Their food is always fresh and tasty. Your average diner. The pricing is good. Quick good food. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food! Grilled chicken salad with avocado was big & filling. Fries were good but the sauces were better! I loved the ranch & the creamy garlic! 
Husband got the honey butter sandwich added bacon meal. Always packed & service was great! Will be back to try the zucchini fries and hand-spun milkshakes mmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place has the very best chicken tenders, hands down. The little fries are so good and I even give 2 thumbs up for the seasonal milkshakes. Love the honey mustard!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I'll say it again...Yum! Best tenders ever! If you go inside, service is much quicker. The sauces are great too. Our stop when we don't feel like cooking but want something that taste homemade and is quick."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  It feels like a fast food place, but the food tastes better, fresher, and healthier.  The menu can seem a bit exotic for a casual dining place, but I would urge you to not alter anything when ordering.  Everything is put together that way for a reason, and its delicious.  Love this place on a saturday or sunday for lunch.  Bump chick fil a and their no sunday gimmick.  This place is the real deal Holifield."}
{"text":"Sometimes less is more.  At Tenders, the simplistic menu of chicken tenders, chicken sandwiches, and a few salads is all it needs to be.  The chicken is amazingly good.  The fries are addictive.  This place is just plain good!!  One of these days I will have to try their shakes.  :)"}
{"text":"This place was great for a quick easy meal.  We didn't go wrong with getting some tenders and fries!"}
{"text":"The chicken is fresh and never frozen. I appreciate the service at this establishment. The slaw with fresh blueberries is a refreshing addition to the menu."}
{"text":"If you like chicken go here.  In college we loved a place called Guthries (which is not in NC) and this reminded us of their chicken fingers (which is ALL they served).  Tenders has a lot of options for chicken and a few non-chicken options.  

My favorites are the grilled chicken salad with the blueberry dressing and candied almonds...YUM...and the tenders basket.  Simple.  The grilled chicken sandwich is really good too.  I love that they have apples with this amazing toffee dip that you can get instead of fries.  

Everyday they have happy hour from 2-4 for 1/2 off beverages and milkshakes.  OH THE MILKSHAKES!  If you're around the area, stop and grab one.  They are perfect for a hot summer day.  

They sell buckets of fingers for parties or tailgating events.  They also cater.  The wonderful folks from 131 Main, saw a need in the community and filled it with a great quick meal option that isn't \"fast food\" quality.  Who doesn't love chicken fingers?"}
{"text":"Tenders is the best!  I like the 4 finger combo with fries and drink with side of buffalo sauce. The fries taste fresh, never frozen, like the come from real potatoes! The tenders beat Raising Cane's and Zaxby's. The atmosphere is great local neighborhood friendly joint, great for kids, plenty of outdoor seating. I like the sea-salt and pepper grinders too. You gotta try to chocolate peanut butter shake! It is the best shake ever, real ice cream and real peanut butter unlike most places. Shakes are half price between 2-5pm. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been to this Tenders location many times in the past few months. 

We've fallen in love. 

The chicken really IS tender. 

And hot.

And juicy. 

And yummy.

I'm not a big fan of the fries because of the seasoning and the fact that they're \"shoestring\", the type of fries I like least. But I eat them because what is a chicken tender without fries?

The ranch dressing is great too. Creamy, slightly sweet, slightly tangy.

They also have those cute new do-it-yourself drink vending machines."}
{"text":"It's chicken.  I think that this is highly over-rated.  People told us to go there for long time and personally I just don't get it, but the food was not bad, however, you can get a good chicken finder almost anywhere nowadays, not a real \"hook\" to have a business like this."}
{"text":"Always exceptional quality, friendly employees and owners!!!  Take all out of town guests here and they rave about what a hidden gem it is."}
{"text":"First time here. I swear these are the best chicken tenders and shake I've had in a while. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Definitely making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Been in once or twice since the big event and I still like it! Chickens grilled or crispy-fried; sandwiched, bowled, or tendered; sides include taters, corns, zucchini, rice-n-beans, and more, plus a soda-matic drink dispenser!
Dining outside was out because of the rain so we sat in the addition enjoying a glimpse of sunshine without getting weathered at. MLB selected the Thai Peanut bowl - grilled instead of crispy, sauce on the side. I stuck with the Pimento Crunch plus fries and a beverage. Yummy chippy cheesey chicky with a side of fries and a mellow-peacho. Fries are a little skinnier than I like but still so good. Got a 5-piece tender meal to go for breakfast or maybe lunch but yeah, it's still good out of the fridge cold."}
{"text":"I took that fateful step and dipped my first bite of that delicious looking chicken into a sauce I thought was cocktail or marinara. Lo and behold it truly was barbecue sauce - likely the most amazing I have ever had!

This was the effect Tenders had on me. One previous reviewer classified this as \"fast food\" but I wouldn't even put it in that category despite the fact that it is in many ways. The fried chicken is juicy and spices cover it with a flavorful embrace. The dipping sauces are honestly to die for. Like I said before, the barbeque looks a lot like cocktail or marinara sauce but its surprisingly a delicious barbeque. And the sweet yet spicy chipotle is a great combination for even those of us who typically don't do spicy so well. The fresh, crispy fries appear to be covered with sea salt - better than the table alternative.

Seal the deal with a desert of granny smith apples soaked in pineapple juice and dipped in a caramel-like Heath bar medley. The staff is awesomely friendly and helpful and even the other patrons of the restaurant are willing to converse with a stranger. Tenders is a delightfully simple eating experience for which I could pass on any fast food alternative any day!"}
{"text":"Tenders is exactly like PDQ in Concord (same owners). It's like a nicer fast food place. They have great sandwiches and salads. I personally love the buffalo chicken sandwich and the grilled turkey sandwich. For the sides they have a blueberry cole slaw which is out of this world! The apples and caramels are good too, as are the fries. Mmmmmm fries!
This place is usually packed for lunch on Friday so parking can get tricky. They have a great patio seating though for when the weather is good. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! Good food. Priced well. If you're in the area and have never been, you need to stop in....try EVERY sauce!!"}
{"text":"We came here because of the good reviews and I don't get the fuss. I would have rather gone to chickfila where the food isn't oily and the place isn't sticky. The cashier was friendly and it seemed like the food might be good. The fries were soggy and the chicken nuggets remind me of homemade nuggets that are caked with breading. We won't be back; it's a greasy summer drive in dive."}
{"text":"Ok, so not a healthy place, it's fried chicken, really really good fried chicken tenders! But OMG, their CA grilled chicken avocado burger is amazing!!! I like that they have the Coca Cola machines that you pour amy kid you want and most of all, they honor our heroes... All military personnel with a nice discount and they give back to our community!"}
{"text":"Tenders lives up to its motto, \"fresh food fast\"! The tenders and sandwiches always taste fresh. I like the grilled tenders and my wife loves the breaded tenders. I try to order somewhat healthy and get the grilled chicken sandwich and apple slices, so I can finish it off with a chocolate milkshake;) Good quick meals!"}
{"text":"I love this place way better than chic-fil-a!!! Awesome buffalo sandwich ever!! The workers are always happy, food fresh and I love the pickles on the fried chicken sandwich!! 
The parking lot is a little dangerous and could use some remodel. Their drive through is very personal though. The employees will walk up to your car and take your order, no audio box. 
I would recommend this place to anyone who lives a good chicken sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Must get the chicken tenders here!  A 3 piece meal was more than enough food for me - comes with 3 tenders over a basket of fries and a drink.  The best part - all of the dipping sauce options and you can choose as many as you want!  I enjoy the sweet sriracha and creamy garlic, but the honey mustard is also good.  Service is great, you receive your food quickly, and it all tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"Tenders was great. The original PDQ.  Sauces are homemade and the chicken tenders are delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. I have ordered Tenders, Salad, & nuggets. I feel as though the grease flavor is what makes the fries grody...old grease maybe? The blueberry coleslaw is strange...normal slaw with blueberries? It would be much better if it offered a fruit as a side. I hate to say it, but Chick-fil-A is better."}
{"text":"Great chicken and fries!  Very busy at lunch (but they handle it well), so go just before or after traditional lunch times."}
{"text":"Oh Tenders, you always have had and always will have a special place in my heart.  Yummy food - quick, great chicken and plenty of seating.  Good to take families because it is quick and fairly inexpensive."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here twice and have stuck to having my favorite. Pimento crunch chicken sandwich, it taste as good as it sounds. Served fresh and hot! I like how you can get your own drink and  specialize what flavor. The fries are thin, hot and tasty! Better than McDonalds. A real potatoe with skin on. Great portions, well worth price. Can not wait to try their hand spun shakes. Already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Perfect for what they do.  Grease city which is good or bad depending what you're looking for"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and hot. 

Sweet tea is on point. 

The apples with toffee spread is the isht. (No for real, the isht!)

The chicken is always super juicy and tender and the fries are thin cut, similar to McDonalds minus the GI issues. 

Plenty of parking. 

A stones throw from the highway, it's a great place to stop if you're traveling through. 

I always make time to hit them up whenever I'm around the area. 

I'm not a fan of the blueberry coleslaw although I thought I would be."}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the management not so much. We purchased four meals and only one was edible, they were drenched in what one could only assume was oil but I was told by the management that no it's their honey sauce. I'm sorry but that was an absurd amount of sauce or whatever you call it, it was not edible, it was visually disgusting. For the inconvenience we were sent several cards that offered either free tenders or a free milkshake with the purchase of another item. We weren't fishing for free tenders or a milkshake but truth be told it would have been nice to at least offer to replace the meals that were thrown in the garbage."}
{"text":"Superb customer service! They seem to take time to train their employees and I have never had a bad experience here! Food is wonderful especially their blueberry cole slaw!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Friday lunch and boy it is hopping! Tenders has their act together so even with all the people, the service moves fast so you don't wait long. 

This place is clearly a local favorite. The food is pretty basic, chicken, fries etc.  but is very good. I can see why so many people like it. I would definitely return based on my visit."}
{"text":"Love bringing these home to the kiddos. Super fresh chicken and great Yelp deal when you check in! Also, the shakes are a must have!"}
{"text":"The lunch/dinner food is nothing special.Typical fried food that's not unique. The milkshakes are great, though. And the atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Tenders and PPQ are both clean, well run, friendly establishments that serve great food. I love the seasoning of their fries and tenders, but what separates them from other joints is their sauces. My personal favorites are the sweet heat and the creamy garlic. I also love their drink machine which offers over 100 different sodas."}
{"text":"I know, I know 5-stars for fast-food, but this is good fast-food.  Definitely not good for you...but good.  

Atmosphere - White, large/ spacious, clean, basic. The only thing that may take this place down a notch to 4-stars is atmosphere.  It's kind of...no...it is sterile.  Bright white sterile.  At least you know it is clean.

Food - Awesome!  I have eaten here twice in three or so weeks (which is good for me as I rarely eat fast-food anymore).  On my first visit I had the Chicken tenders, which were very fresh tasting.  No precooked and frozen then fried chicken here!  It came w/ a side of fresh cut fries and a tea.  All tasty.  On my second visit I had the Cajan Fried Turkey sandwich.  It had the right amount of kick and was not dry as turkey can sometimes be.  It was a filet cut too, no ground turkey.  Again, I got the meal w/ fresh cut fries and a tea...all delicious.  ( I believe they have grilled options...but who wants that?)

Price - On my second visit it was $7.21 out the door.


Overall - For fast-food this is a 5-star place.  I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's super quick and always so delicious. The chicken is so good. Fries are good. Always a good trip for lunch. I've never had anything from here that wasn't good. They have drive up menu boards so you can get in one of the multiple lanes."}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers I have ever encountered. And their honey mustard sauce is so amazing I have considered dipping everything in it. I was actually thinking to myself, if this was a Popsicle I would eat it. 

Eat here. Fly here from California and eat here."}
{"text":"Better than Chick-fil-a!  I said it, ladies and gentlemen.  Tenders has the best fast food...strike that...in general, the BEST chicken fingers I have EVER had!  They are always fresh with a perfectly balanced breading and their house made sauces are a great pairing.  My favorite is the honey mustard sauce, but they are all good.  The fries are also very good, but my favorite side is the apples with whatever dip they serve with it.  I want to eat a gallon of the dip every time we get it.  I don't know what's in it, but I don't even care :)  I have never gotten a shake, but I am sure they are good, too!"}
{"text":"Great lunch combo.  Chicken was juicy and yummy.  They have added sauces which are delicious.  Even at lunchtime they were busy but orders came up quick."}
{"text":"My girlfriend raved about this place for a long time, and I finally tried it last week. Was excellent, crispy tenders.  Fries were excellent, and the prices are great. Also food came out fast!"}
{"text":"By far the best chicken tenders on the surface of the universe and complimented by the most beautiful sauces to dip them in and wonderful crispy flavorful fries. This place is legendary for quick American food that has real quality and flavor. Great staff and environment to eat in. Also really enjoyed that I could play corn hole outside with friends.  Warning not exactly healthy food but if thats what your looking for look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Since I moved away from North Caroline 1 year ago, Tenders has been one of the things I miss most about NC. I dream in Tenders. Honestly, it doesn't get any better than 3 tenders, fries, a soda, and a TON of Texas Pete.

Def eat in, you don't want those fries getting soggy. 

Tenders, I love you with all my heart and soul."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food! FRESH, hormone-free, never microwaved or frozen, and super high quality meats. This is the original Tenders - they now have over 50 restaurants (only about 4 years old), and are also known as PDQ (People Dedicated to Quality.) 

This was created by a chef from 131 Main, so...they have the same DELICIOUS shoestring fries. The chicken is always perfectly cooked, the batter (secret ingredient: Rosemary!) is always crispy and perfectly cooked), and the chicken is always juicy.

They ALSO have incredible salads, apples (with this ungodly dip!!!), shakes, and amazing TURKEY breast. They have a ton of dippers and seriously everything is amazing.

They support local small businesses, and have promotions (soon to start selling hats) where all the proceeds go to support local vets. The current promotion is going to a local vet who needs a service dog. Good people!

They're a FRESH-FAST-FOOD place you must try! Don't be intimidated by the long lines, they move very fast!

They have all the sauces - including homemade special sauces - you could need. They also have two of those awesome COKE ZERO machines. 

The menu has plenty of options, plus yummy milkshakes. Also, as of this post date, you get a deal if you check in online. See my photos for the menu, and the offer... Note, the photo is NOT the offer, you have to check in. 

If you take the time to check in, do them the favor and write a review to tell everyone how awesome they are. I hope the photos and review help - try them out!"}
{"text":"Get an extra straw for the sauces!  The tenders are amazing, the fries are fresh, the coke machine will give you any flavor under the sun, the milkshakes (esp strawberry) are amazing...but i think i love the sauces the most.  And they don't nickle and dime you for extras :).  Thanks for the Lowe's Corp discount as well as all of the donations you give to my kids preschool & sports teams - a local hero you are!"}
{"text":"Love this place. so fresh and love the buffalo blue dressing. Make sure you check in with yelp as they has a discount coupon.  Its saves us a few dollars.  Great place for a fresh lunch"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  It's a nicer alternative to big chain chicken restaurants.  I've had the fried turkey sandwich and the buffalo chicken sandwich, both of which were VERY good.  HUGE portion of fries to go with the meal. Really enjoy their milkshakes too!!!"}
{"text":"Tenders is by far the best fast food around! The food is amazing and super fresh. I would say it's up there with Chick-fil-a in quality. The food is fresh and made to order. So the food is good, I ordered a chicken tenders meal and it exceeded my expectations. The tenders were perfectly breaded and served so nice and hot. Wow. I also ordered the buffalo chicken and crispy chicken salad and alternated dipping as they both were yummy. The fries were also delicious. Lastly I love the soda machine, endless choices. Friendly employees, delicious food in a clean restaurant, what more could you ask for?

The place is big, clean, and has a relaxed vibe to it. The staff is super friendly and the prices are great. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Tenders... where almost everything (except the fries) are fresh!

I won't go on and on about Tenders because the reviews and pictures speak for themselves! 

The service is quick. The cashiers get you in and out and are helpful. The food then comes out quickly... just be sure to listen to your name being called because it can get busy so you may not hear it. They have those cool soda machines with a million flavors which brings back so much nostalgia as a kid mixing up all the soda flavors. Staff keeps the lobby clean so I've never had issues with seating.

The food is delicious. I typically always get the tenders and zucchini fries with a side of honest mustard and creamy garlic sauce. 

The only reason why I cannot give them 5 stars is because of the parking lot. Everytime I visit during lunch, I'm always almost in a head on accident because there is just no flow to the lot... the food is definitely worth the risk though!"}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh fresh fresh. Chicken Tenders are the best you will find anywhere. Wide variety of special sauces for your tenders. Milk shakes are a must. Puts the corporate fast food joints to shame. Yes even Chick-fila takes second place to Tenders. I have to visit here at least twice on every trip I make to visit family."}
{"text":"Cool local Chicken Shack!, Good Breaded Chicken and Milkshakes

The store was very brightly colored and had a good layout for moving people through the ordering process.  The have a good bit of offerings in the ways you can receive your chicken, but I decided to stick with the standard chicken tenders and Fries for the side.

The chiplote bbq sauce is good, not hot at all. I enjoy the thinner cut fries as well.

After eating, I had to go back and get a malted vanilla milkshake.  I appreciate the face that they understand the need for a large straws to properly enjoy a milkshakes.  It made the sucking process much more streamlined than the pencil thin straws."}
{"text":"Love me some Tenders. I usually stop here every weekend before going out on the lake. Buffalo chicken sandwich is delicious! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally, I made a trip to Tenders for dinner.  This is a nice little spot for a quick bite to eat.  I had the crispy tucker breast sandwich with cajun spice, served on an egg bun with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and sweet heat sauce.  It was served with fries and the absolutely delectable apple slices with toffee dip! Loved the sandwich and applies with dip!  The fries were a bit salty but I didn't want them anyway.  On my next visit, I will ask for a double serving of applies instead.  Beware, the kids chicken finger meal comes with just one chicken finger, so order wisely if you have a hungry lad.  It is most likely true that they have 100 drinks.  I didn't take the time to explore them all, but they are PLENTIFUL (see photo) and you can drink to your heart's content.  I had lemonade (delicious) and tea mixed and was completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders I have ever had in my life. Come here and get really full. Military get a discount. $10++ if u want the 5 tenders combo with a drink....but so worth it. Try the creamy garlic and the caesar dressing for dipping."}
{"text":"Ever since I first passed this place I was intrigued to check it out, but  we don't do fast food too often so the chance never came about. So when I was home sick all day today and didn't feel like going out for dinner, the miss' suggested bringing home some Tenders for dinner. The thought of warm, fried chicken made me feel slightly better, and it was indeed one of those comfort meals that I happened to be craving at the time.

Tenders doesn't look all that great from the outside, but the food being cooked up within is legit. The menu consists of chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches (both grilled and fried) along with a couple of sides and milkshakes. The miss' brought home some chicken tenders, fries, apple slices and a vanilla milkshake. All the food is made fresh in house so the quality is there, and the price is definitely affordable for the meal you get.

The chicken tenders were delicious. The meat was warm and juicy...absolutely no dried, tough chicken here! Like a normal chicken tender, the batter/crust was not spiced or anything, and the batter wasn't overkill. When I make tenders at home I tend to spice it up so I kind of missed that. But that doesn't take away from the overall taste of the chicken, which was still awesome. Also, I have to say that for a fried chunk of chicken the tenders were not overly greasy. I chose the honey mustard as my dipping sauce and it was pretty yummers...had a nice sweetness to it and really played nicely with the chicken (though I wish they gave you a little more...my little bucket of sauce barely lasted all three chicken fingers and left none for my fries.) Simply put, that is some satisfying chicken. 

The fries were also pretty good, and you get a heaping handful of them with your order. They are hand cut in house and I love the quality you get from fries like that. The taste was great, yet the fries were a bit over-salted. Also, I did find the fries soggy, but I'll attribute that to the fact that the miss' did take out and brought it home to me. I'll give Tenders the benefit of the doubt that they are that much better fresh from the fryer.

The apples were definitely awesome and I definitely enjoyed them as a side over the fries. The order came with eight Granny Smith apple slices and some toffee dipping sauce. The apples were fresh, crisp and visually perfect...no brown spots or bruises to be seen. These tart apples went PERFECTLY with the toffee dipping sauce. The apples and sauce is simply something that you HAVE to get if you go to Tenders. The toffee is so sweet and soft, yet adheres to the apples like glue. I loved that there were little chunks of crunchy toffee in the dipping sauce!

Lastly comes the milkshake. We shared a plain vanilla shake and I was happy. It was sweet and creamy and didn't have that fake super sweet taste that some fast food shakes (I'm looking at you, McDonalds) have. The cold and creamy beverage really went well with the chicken tenders and fries.

Tenders is definitely one of the best fast food options available in Huntersville/ Cornelius. I'd choose to go there for a quick bite over any other burger or chicken joint in the area, hands down. Though since it is fast, fried, and relatively unhealthy food I definitely won't be a regular here anytime soon. Aside from a few minor nit-picks Tenders is a great place to stop by if you need a last minute meal idea."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming to Tenders. The chicken is, dare I say, tender. It's fresh and crispy and delicious, and as I write this I'm craving Tenders.

I'm a skinny, crispy, thin, french fry type of girl. I love when they're thin and slightly greasy but not too oily. Tenders checks all of the boxes for my favorite french fries. Something about them with an array of their sauces just makes me so happy.

Maybe because it is never frozen, sometimes there's a lot of not so fun parts to chew on the chicken. This is the only reason why I'm taking off a star. But I also know the fuss of trying to cook chicken.

Order as many sauces that you like, there's no limit. Try them all and you'll end up loving them!"}
{"text":"Tenders is the bomb. I don't think people still use that phrase, but they should. Service inside (and out) is always pleasant and moves through a line quickly. 

Three tender combo with fries and a drink never fails to satisfy! The food is always fresh and hot, and I love how well they season their thinly cut fries. Their house made sauces are all so delicious (LOVE the honey mustard), I may have even used some leftover garlic sauce on fried rice one time. 

I live in South Charlotte now, but I'll make a detour if I'm remotely close to the area to enjoy some Tenders!"}
{"text":"Ok, went there today for the first time. Had heard how good it was supposed to be but was skeptical.  Well believe it.  Best chicken sandwich, best fries I've ever tasted in my sixty years on this earth.  No wonder the parking lot is always full.  Great service also. Awesome place"}
{"text":"Love tenders! The crispy chicken sandwich is amazing with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles! Love their fresh cut fries! The service is fine, you order and pick up your food like most quick food, but they usually come around and ask if you need anything. And they have cheerwine!"}
{"text":"Fry anything and it'll taste good, right?  Well, not always.  Thankfully this ISN'T one of those times.

Stopped in for lunch with 3 adults and 2 kids.  The adults absolutely loved the chicken fingers and all the delicious dipping sauces (there's a ton, don't believe the sign that says you can ask for only 1).  The kids (ages 1 & 4) were more about the French Fries and the Milkshakes.

We all walked away satisfied!"}
{"text":"They are awesome. If your in the mood for fast food but not that fast food taste then you have to try them out. They give you alot of food and there fries are awesome. Didn't try there shakes but will definitely next time."}
{"text":"Have been here many times before and loved it. Today's visit not so much. They have some new sandwiches which I thought I'd try, both are awful. The honey butter sandwich, I mean come on a complete rip off from Chic fil a. Although chic fil a is much better. This sandwich was served with Rock hard bread and then returned it for a new sandwich and was served the driest piece of chicken I've ever had. Had a hard time even taking a bite with my teeth, yea it was disgusting and now I've been sick if you know what I mean since eating here. Probably won't be back for a while until the thought of spending the rest of the day on the toilet gets out of my mind."}
{"text":"A lot great sauces to accompany some of the best chicken tenders I have ever found. Food is pretty comparable to Raising Cane's and I loved their Coca Cola freestyle options to accompany my meal."}
{"text":"Tenders is great for what it is. A limited menu of poultry based (chicken and turkey grilled or fried) sandwiches and fresh chicken tenders with good dipping sauces. No frills but they know what they are doing in this space. 

The service is fast and friendly and I love the drive up, at your car, service if you want it to go. Only requests would be to go back to the original fries and add both a spicy chicken and a chicken salad sandwich to the menu."}
