{"text":"Arrived at demetres to meet a friend who was already waiting to get seated for at least 10 minutes ... after we arrived ... waited another 15 minutes to secure a seat for three ... me and my wife are regulars at demetres ... so we don't look at the menu .. we order right away.  Asked the person who seated us that we are ready to order ... he said no problem, he will send our server ... about a minimum of 10 minutes passed by ... the same person who seated us said he could not find our server and therefore he will take our order ... so knowing what exactly I wanted ... I go to order my crepe ... with strawberries ... apparently they didn't have strawberries ... when asked why? The response was; it's not the season and our supplier didn't have them ... ok ... fair enough. .. I was kind of upset as this is my regular crepe .... my wife convinced me to get apples instead .. I agreed and asked the waiter to put apples on the side ... my wife and our friend ordered hot drinks ...   The 2 hot drinks come within 10 minutes ... and I'm waiting for my crepe ... as my wife and our friend started sipping on their hot drinks ... I started to eagerly look around for my crepe ... their drinks were about half way done .. before my crepe arrived ... already being upset for not having strawberries ... guess what? The apple topping was on top of the crepe NOT on the side as ordered ... the waiter agreed to make it right .. another 5 minutes passed by and their hot drinks were finishing up ... so I gave up and asked my waiter to bring the bill ... and the bill arrived and sure enough that crepe that never made it properly to my table was on the bill ..   The bottom line ... not impressed at all."}
{"text":"perfect date night spot.  Save your sweet tooth for a night at demetres Portions are big enough to share, I learned that the hard way!! Love the cappuccino with the side mini biscotti. Cute little spot on those nights you don't know where to go"}
{"text":"Love the strawberry crepes. If you have a small stomach I suggest you share the crepes. Small and clean. Quaint location. Not crazy like the Courtney park local."}
{"text":"Love their waffle ! Great crowd, but be prepared to wait for few minutes before you get the seat especially  on weekends."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a few of my friends. The food was great and the host was super kind and attentive. I got the Moo La La and my friend got the Tongue Depressor. Both dishes were delicious and the portions were super generous."}
{"text":"Cannot complain about the amazing crepes or sweet treats! The service and management on the orher hand requires major improvement.   After dinner with friends on Friday night we decided to go for dessert knowing it would be busy. We enter the establishment at around 9:00pm. We were a party of 8.  Customers were lined up and waiting. In line there was a couple already waiting 20 minutes for table, when a party of 5 came in and was seated right away in a booth. The couple asked to speak to the manager.  The manager came over with a explanation that it was his policy to make customers comfortable and on a busy night he could not seat two people at a table that would accommodate the larger parties.  Although the couple was not happy they waited for a smaller table. From a business prospective I too would want a larger group to bring in a profit, however what happened next was a real disappointment.  The head waitress informed us that the booth she was going to seat us at had been occupied by the managers friends since 7:30pm and they were only a party of 2. I of course asked to speak to the manager.  He came over and said he could not make anyone leave, which is understandable but this was not my dispute and he would not allow me express my concern. I raised my voice and asked him to let me explain. Basically I threw back at him what he had told the couple before. He explained that the group was bigger before we got there. Which would not have been an issue until he said he could not give them a bill until they asked for it.   As a business owner I would be livid. The managers buddies have been in the store seating at a larger table for 2.5 hours now and he says \"they didn't ask for the bill and they are regulars.\"  I have no issue with the group that was seated,  but really common courtesy on the managers behalf would have been nice! He was so rude!  We were seated at around 10pm and the manager sucked all the staff into the drama. When our water was brought over the wiaitness pushed the tray of water on the table and walked away. Very rude. Also, swearing in the walk way to restroom infront of minors. Very unprofessional.  Not a pleasant experience at all. If I owned this place I would check he camera's! Good thing we know someone who will talk to the owner and hopefully make some needed changes to a great place."}
{"text":"This place will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth cravings. Every time I come here, its always busy but the service is fast. The menu serves a combination of desserts, you can customize your order with whatever toppings you like."}
{"text":"I was visiting from the states. I've seen pictures of this place from my friend and I just had to try it myself. I got the tongue depressor and it was one of the best desserts I ever had. My friend got the the art of the peel and it looked as good as it tasted. This is definitely a place I will come back to."}
{"text":"really disappointed with the service here. came here for dessert as the Keg didn't have what we wanted. We wanted a booth but because one wasn't available we were left at the high top tables - and we waited for about 40 minutes before someone even came back around even though we asked a few times (which included asking for water.) finally after being ready to walk out after seeing a booth was available we were seated. We asked the server to take our order right away as we've been waiting for a while but he still walked away and took his time coming back.  we placed our order as we already waited but decided never to come back to horrible service like this again."}
{"text":"This use to be a great place for dessert but over the years they kept changing the menu which I never liked. Or they would make one of the things I would always get different every time I ordered it. Just visited today for Father's Day and the ice cream sucks now. Didn't enjoy it at all. If your looking for a great place try spin desserts they recently changed the name to bliss. It's a great place"}
{"text":"I called them at 10.30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11. When I arrived with a party of 15 ( which I mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude. Lack of professionalism and courtesy."}
{"text":"This review is not food related- Decided to come here with some friends around 8:30pm today Sunday.....and they're closed. No notice provided on the door or on google, please update special hours to save your customers the unnecessary commute. Sadly we made the trip out especially for Demetres, so disappointed it's depressing."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best dessert establishments I've ever been too. Unfortunately, it's only a Canada thing!!! :( I've been here twice (once this summer and once like 4 years ago) and it really hasn't changed one bit. The atmosphere is really lively and the decor makes the place look upscale and romantic. They have indoor and outdoor seating as well.   I highly recommend their crepes. They're really large and is plenty enough to share with a friend. I tried the Pomme Pilot and Strawberry crepe (i don't remember the name) but they were both amazing. I prefered the Pomme pilot just because I like apples more. I appreciate how  generous they were on the fruit and ice cream. The best part is the crepe itself comes out hot while the ice cream is solid cold and when they melt together... it's heavenly.   So if you're in the area definitely give this place a try, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT CANADIAN."}
{"text":"Date night brought me here and I didn't even eat the massive and decadent desserts.  I did order chai vanilla tea without sugar which was delicious.  My hubby had a crepe filled with chocolate ice cream. Service was quick and friendly and topped off with more chocolate treats to walk away with.  There was a line up but we were seated pretty quickly and there was a line up out the door when we left.  Wow. Pics included in this one!!!"}
{"text":"Having came here a few times, I have to say that this Demetres is \"just okay\".  Being famous for their crepes (and waffles), I usually order one of the specialty crepes. The crepes made here tastes a bit bland compared to the other Demetres I've been to (Courtney Park, AMC). So once you take a bite, it is usually just the taste of the other toppings + ice cream.   The cafe also tends to be very busy during weekends and fridays (as you would expect), so the service will tend to be a bit sloppy (sometimes they forget to refill your water, or that you wanted to pay)."}
{"text":"Kids love this place for the Desserts and our guests seem to enjoy this unique place. We were in Brampton and wanted to try the new menu that was perhaps updated from the last time we were at Oakville and Courtney Park location.   It was a summer weeknight and place was busy. But a table opened up quickly. I was delighted to see there were some vegan options available.   Ordered an Interstella on a waffle, a Pomme Pilot, a Make your Mango Crazy (vegan) and a Beaches and Cream (vegan).   The Interstella and the PPilot were shared and kids devoured the and nothing was left which means it was a 5/5.   The Mango Crazy was a Mango Smoothie which tasted exactly like Sante Fontaine - Fountain of Health Mango sorbet that we purchased from Costco. It was a unanimous agreement that this came from the above company (2/5). It seemed to us that this was perhaps put in a blender for a few seconds and served.   The Beaches and Cream was supposed to come with a scoop of coconut and a scoop of Passion Fruit sorbet. However a few minutes later we were told that they have run out of coconut sorbet and we had a choice of Mango sorbet or two scoops of Passion Fruit sorbet. Having just tasted the Mango smoothie we decided on a double scoop of Passion Fruit sorbet which was a big mistake. Even though the sundae is sprinkled with bananas and dark chocolate sauce, the sourness of PF sorbet was just too much. All we tasted was an incredibly sour sundae (1/5). At end of it was just too much for us. A big disappointment.   The service was very good and she was attentive. The place well decorated."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with dessert for dinner? I had the peanut butter cheesecake with peanut butter ice cream! Devine! Only 10 calories too lol others ordered crepes splits and it all looked great"}
{"text":"It's probably the time of the month again.. ( you know what I mean)... When I arrive from school last night instead of eating dinner. ..I craved for dark, moist sweet thing... so..I changed my uniform and I thought I'd go to demetre's. .. .. and of course it didn't disappoint me.. I ordered Cocoa Ono.. and I was in heaven!.:)  I had to share it because the serving is too much for me.. .   When I came here the first time  the attendant recommended Chewbaklava.. that one is great too.. !   If you have a sweet tooth this place will never disappoint you. It may seem a little pricey but you get what you paid for..   This is one of the great places to vist when you feel like bonding with your friends or family..eating sweets makes you feel good.. it's makes you happy. . The ambiance here is nice. .. The staff are friendly..but take note,  you must eat everything slowly.. take your time.. enjoy.... or else you'll get sick of it easy. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great and the service was on point on Valentine's Day. That is probably one of their busiest day ever but they were doing great and were very attentive. We sat at the bar with many of the other couples which was a little frustrating but we were still able to have a great time and love coming back here with friends and just on our own as well. I love the Brampton location although I wish it was a little bigger."}
{"text":"I hate Demetres with a fiery passion usually reserved for things that actually matter, not opinions on restaurants. Unfortunately, I have friends that inexplicably love this place and so I am back time and time again...  Here's a list of terrible things about Demetres: - The place is way too small and always packed. There is often a line-up outside the door and they have NO system to manage this. None. No hostess, no hostess desk, no pagers, no pen and paper, they rarely acknowledge you, it is incredibly confusing to know who's next, the wait time, etc. And all staff always seem flustered that they are this busy as if it's never happened before. How can a place so consistently busy not invest in ONE hostess to manage this? - The service in general is just bad. Tables are rarely served their desserts at the same time and there is often a long gap between the first and last person at your table getting their plate. When you're dealing so often in ice cream, this can be a problem - The pricing is absurd. Their portions may be big but they're uneccessarily big for the average person and it's not exactly something you can get a doggy bag for. Also, I don't even fully understand the concept. These desserts are so big that it would be impossible to have any sort of dinner and visit Demetres at some point in the same evening. But back to the price. I've worked in restaurants with incredible dessert chefs who worked at Buckingham Palace. Their desserts were roughly the same price as these. Except those were expertly crafted and designed and these consist of various boring staples (waffles, crepes, sundaes, etc.) loaded with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  In conclusion, Demetres is everything that is wrong with Brampton cuisine as a whole wrapped into a crepe and then drowned with caramel brownie fudge."}
{"text":"I love my sweets especially when it involves waffles and ice cream.. but first let me start off by saying   LOCATION; it has a good spot close to the mall coffee shop and restaurants and it's even close to chinguacousy park so you can walk off the sweets if the night is nice..  SERVICE: the waitress we had was very friendly the only issue really is it takes a long time to get noticed when you enter the cafe to even be seated we stood for 10mins just waiting to get a table.. they do take a very long time to take your order and make the dish so don't go here of your really hungry have a small snack first hehe..  FOOD; BLUSH-MY sister fiance orderd this he changed the white chocolate to the strawberry sauce but they did forget so the added both when we brought it to the servers attention it was good had alot of strawberries   APPLAUSE-MY sister got this it was good it's like apple pie but with a waffle on the bottom.. has a nice caramel sauce can't go wrong.  SPLITSONIAN- and for my son and myself cause we like strawberry and banana and who doesn't love Nutella drizzled over it.. I did change the ice cream instead of their honey vanilla I choose the white silk chocolate ice cream which was delicious..  Overall it's a place with good dessert they just need to work on their timing and paying attention to their customers that are waiting"}
{"text":"I had recently gone in, service was not fast or exactly slow, about moderate. I had a tough time making a decision due to the lack of pictures on the menu. So i went in blind only trusting to the descriptions given.  I ended up ordering the \"tongue depressor\" on a crepe. The order came after about 10 minutes. It looked very appetizing and appealing to the eye (no pics lol)  The size of it was hugs, about 16\" in diameter i assume. Anyways i ate the thing and was full before i could finish the dish. I ate about 7/8 of the dish and left.  I felt very sick approxiamtely 30 mins after. Super dehydrated after drinking 3 glasses of water respectfully. On the bus home i got intense nausea and started sweating (like when you get drunk and are about to puke) i then jumped off the bus and entered a gas station where i tried to puke (unsuccessful)  I ended up buying a powerade and it helped slightly. I have very little appetitie and have nauseous phases when i think about chocolate now. Its about 10 pm and i went at 4 pm. Still feeling fuarked.   I cannot totally blame the place, maybe my fault for eating alot of it. Do not attenpt the tongue depressor on your own if you want to survive.  Tasted good though."}
{"text":"I keep on forgetting that there's a location near Bramalea City Centre because I end up going to the Courtney Park drive location instead!  What I really enjoy here is that you're seated quickly, and the variety of desserts they have come out pretty quickly too. Despite all of this, I usually settle for either 3 to 4 slices of cheesecake and a whole load of ice cream because I absolutely love the way the cheesecake is made here!  If you're ever in the area and have a bit of a sweet tooth, don't settle for less, make your way over here and grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Quite upset with what happened the other night. I was excited to see a new vegan option on the menu and ordered \"Truffle Time\". I posted a photo of it and one of my Facebook friends told me it is not vegan, that Demetres has mistakenly labelled it as such. She said her waiter told her this when she was about to order it. At no point in time was I notified about \"Truffle Time\" not being vegan and it actually containing dairy and eggs. My waitress did not say anything about it. I was even talking to her after expressing my excitement about Demetres getting new vegan options for the summer menu. I used to come and get the Ariana Sundae or the mango sorbetto quite often. I have not eaten animal products in well over 3 years. Misleading labels like this on menus is extremely unacceptable. I spoke to the manager I believe and he said Demetres will not be reprinting new menus. It could've easily been resolved by putting a sticker covering the vegan symbol, or nicely scribbled out with a sharpie, etc. There were many things that could've been done to avoid this other than having to re-print all menus. Putting a sticker over the mistake, or scribbling it out neatly with a sharpie. Misleading labels is illegal and goes against The Food and Drugs Act so this is a huge offence, Demetres. This is not just on the fault of the waitress for not telling me, this is on the entire business. I will not be returning to any Demetres locations in the future."}
{"text":"I would say 2.5-3. I'm undecided.  I probably wouldn't go back here because I'm not the biggest crepe fan and because I got extremely sick after (that was my own fault), but if a friend invited me I probably wouldn't say no either.  I ordered the chocolate milkshake and a banana strawberry crepe. They forgot the strawberries even though I paid extra, I didn't say anything,  our server was too nice and busy. The milkshake was good but nothing special,  I prefer Licks' or William's' milkshakes over this one (and they're a tad cheaper)."}
{"text":"If you like ice cream, desert and coffee/Latte this is the place to go to get your cravings fulfilled..  Big plates great to share..."}
{"text":"Finally a place to have delicious desserts in a simple but elegant setting serviced by top notch waiters.  Came to Demetre's on the recommendation of a friend. He was specific on recommending this particular location in Brampton, there is a difference between locations and it's reflected in the Yelp ratings.  Walking in I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful interior decor: white and gray with accents of red with a modern European feel to it all. The hostess sat us at a tiny table for two but when I saw the beautiful red round booths I had to ask our waiter, Jonathan, if we could move.   Cute menu created by a local artist; it changes with the seasons. Went with the Stormy Weather (espresso, caramel, honey vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream), Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and Earl Grey tea. One taste and I saw the heavens open up and a choir of angels sing! FINALLY a dessert place that doesn't hide behind mountains of sugar. You can actually taste the different flavors that make up their desserts and drinks, what a concept!  You can tell that they use high quality ingredients with flavors that harmonize beautifully with one another: Nielsen Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, Barry Callebaut Belgian Chocolate, Cocoa Barry French chocolate, loose leaf tea from Sloane Fine Tea Merchants. A little pricey but as they explain on their website: \"in order to actually achieve great desserts, you can only use great ingredients.\"   Come on! You deserve a treat once in a while. Bring your significant other and indulge in their luscious offerings, soak in the ambiance and get treated like VIPs."}
{"text":"An okay place for gathering and socializing over dessert. There's a good variety of reasonably fresh desserts. They may be a touch pricey but no worse than you'd be paying in any restaurant."}
{"text":"Not as crazy as the Courtney Park location but definitely great! Though it does take a while for the food to come out, it is worth it. My go to dessert place!"}
{"text":"Honestly it's a dessert place... who couldn't leave happy? It's sinful decadence and worth every calorie and penny spent. The portions are large and generally I will ask for a 1/2 portion of Ice cream as I never finish. The hot couture is amazing and so are their teas. Staff are exceptional, attentive and very good at helping you decide on what would suit your current pallet. Love this place, it's a must try if you've never been. It's fairly inexpensive when compared to chain restaurant dessert prices and vastly more worth your while."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ice creams are so decadent and they have something for everyone. Waffles, crepes, sundaes, milkshakes or cakes there is an endless variety. The prices are also good and because the portions are generous a lot of the options can be split with friends!I am a Die hard fan! ^^  Quick side note the location at BCC does not offer the sweet and spicy peanuts even though its on their menu. Kinda dissapointing since I have my usual order, so peanut lovers beware!"}
{"text":"So me and my friend walked in, and we didn't know whether or not to sit immediately or wait, but we sat immediately. A guy came up to us and handed us menus (he wasn't in uniform, but he said he worked there) I was surprised that he even noticed us because the server was busy :) Server came up to us pretty quick (he was the only server there) and we said our order. With there being 5 other tables I was surprised he got to us fairly quick and that our desserts were ready in about 5 minutes. We were very satisfied. My friend dropped his cookie and the server offered us a free one, and I was surprised cause we didn't even ask for an extra one. He was very nice to us. The desserts were great, made to perfection, doesn't look rushed...looks like a great deal of care and perfection was done. Definitely, will be coming back for the fast service and the perfectly made desserts!"}
{"text":"The red velvet cheesecake with icecream does manage to take you to different world , giving one a dopamine rush like no other. The crepes with ice cream is just about okay, nothing spectacular but still noteworthy."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Demetre. I really like the layout and the larger space, a bit larger than some of the other locations that I've been to.  Have you ever been to a Cafe Demetre? No? It's a restaurant concept that I really haven't quite seen in the US, particularly not done in a chain format. You've got lots of desserts, with pretty enormous portion sizes. When Lee and I go here, we inevitable just end up splitting on dessert, because otherwise it's likely to cause stomach stress.  They have a very twee and pun filled menu with might cause you to roll your eyes, but there's also a dazzling array of options on display. Do you want cake? Do you want waffles with ice cream and chocolate sauce and little chocolate coins? Nutella and bananas? They even do have just simple ice cream in a dish, if that's your thing.  They also have great coffee and coffee drinks."}
{"text":"I love Demitries for a spur of the moment date night. A great place to swing by after dinner for a yummy dessert.  Only down side is it has become pretty popular so be prepared to wait a few mins for a table. Also I find the pricing to be a little on the high side but Im willing to pay because the desserts are really good.   Personal Favorite: The O.C Milkshake"}
{"text":"The banana split was delicious, the portion was so generous that we were able to share it amongst 3 people. We also ordered the tea and cake combo (with the red velvet cheesecake torte). The cake slice was really small, not sure why... I guess overall it all balances out?"}
{"text":"This is the best dessert place I have ventured to and unfortunately it's here in Canada.   Came with a wagon of kids all under the ages of 14. The store has cute booths and bar tables with delectable cakes on display.   The menu itself looks like doodles a high schooler would make during class. Options are simple scoops of ice cream, crepes/waffles, milkshakes and teas. Substitutions are allowed as we substituted bananas for strawberries for the Moo La La.  Summertime Fatness, Moo La La, Last Straw, Blush,  and a crepe with vanilla bean ice cream which I don't recall the name.   Holy. We were expecting to get ripped off with tiny portions but oh my, Caffe Demetres, you are generous with your portions.   All items were so aesthetically pleasing and we were scrambling to take pictures to post. All ice cream served were smooth and didn't have that 'sitting around' taste. The crepes and waffles didn't smell or taste like flour. The strawberries were nicely tart and a nice complement to the sweetness.   I had the Summertime Fatness to myself, all chocolate with brownies, Coco Chanel ice cream, Belgian white chocolate and French Dark chocolate. I could only finish half and almost regret not sharing. Everything was tasty and not sickeningly sweet when shared. But really, I highly advise to share as five items were more than enough for 7 people. Bill was ~$77 not including tip.  Afterwards, we were all given a piece of Caffe Demetres chocolate to continue our sugar rush. What an awesome establishment, thanks Caffe Demetres!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a demetries - at least 7 years and well before my gluten free life. In the past the experience has just been good - good food, nice ambience, kind of crowded, and halfway decent prices (hey, I was a student which meant $15 seemed more like $40).  Regardless, when an out of town friend chose that as the meeting space I checked online to see that they had gfree options and confirmed our date!  We went on a weekday (Monday actually) so it wasn't busy at all, but still had business. I didn't have the option of ordering any sort of crepe or waffle (sadness) but ice cream sans gluteny-things is always good too. I decided to order the \"Katy Berry\" which was a sundae with strawberry ice cream (made in house with strawberries marinaded in balsamic), strawberries, white chocolate drizzle (that hardened-the best kind of chocolate drizzle!!) and whipped cream. The portion size was massive, especially considering the under $10 price tag. I was amazed! The ice cream was delicious, the strawberries were fresh and crisp, and the chocolate drizzle was so good I wanted to scrape it off the glass. The whipped cream was fairly flavorless but it bodes well with the mass amounts of sugar in the rest of the sundae. But here's the part of the review where I share why I gave 5 stars (when 4 stars is clearly my go-to). When I told him I needed gluten free and he confirmed that it was serious, he told me that they take gfree very seriously and make every effort to double wash items that are used for both gluten and non-gluten items (like ice cream scoops) and to keep cross-contamination from occurring as best they can (with the usual disclaimer). He was so earnest in ensuring my stomach safety that I couldn't help but lose my usual feeling of potential gluten-poisoning anxiety whenever I go out. Also, the fact that he didn't say something like \"so then do you want the waffle in the sundae??\" made me happy. You wouldn't believe the questions I get sometimes.  The website also had a very clear section on what items are gluten free and which aren't. All of the toppings sauces and ice-creams are gfree - excluding any that overtly include gluten, like cookie dough, brownies, etc. There were a surprising number of options available and while I hope they eventually expand to include gfree waffles and crepes, I will definitely be back again and again to enjoy their delicious ice cream!!"}
{"text":"You know what I was honestly thinking three stars but this place is too unique and eclectic!      Desserts named after famous movies, waffles, crepes, icecream sundaes...and all this at 3:45 a.m? I rest my case."}
{"text":"STEP AWAY FROM THE CREPE BRITANY! Is what I need someone to say to me on a regular basis. I have been this Demetres far more times then I care to admit. I love strawberries and whip cream and tend to order Blush or the Last Straw. Recently I've decided to branch out and tried Pomme Pilot and Tongue Depressor. They were good but i'll stick to my old faithfuls. For any of you that haven't been the Demetres in a while they revamped their menu last year and now they have options for my lactose intolerant brothers and sisters. I've adapted a yolo attitude so it doesn't really make a difference but I appreciate the effort. Don't be fooled by the famous waffle and crepe pictures they also offer cakes, sundaes, milkshakes, coffee, tea, etc. One of my favourite places to go to satisfy my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I love desserts but a place which only offers desserts has to maintain a certain level of standard. Let me tell you straight up..... Caffe Demetres rocks!!! The selection of desserts is amazing..... its service is top notch and the staff is supper nice. At least my first experience was pretty amazing. Kids would love to go here to have desserts. Two things to note..... dont eat too much food before you go here & dont order individual dishes.... the size is ginormous!!!  Try all desserts. This one is a place for anyone's bucket list jn GTA for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this demetres location. Great staff, great service !! We end up going once a month. It was my husband's birthday and they brought out a special plate along with our order and sang happy birthday.  The order is always correct, on time & tastes sooo good!!  Definitely recommend to everyone. We always bring our guests from out of town and they absolutely love the variety!"}
