{"text":"Normal bar food,  nothing spectacular but a good meal.  Lots of TV's at the bar good visibility for watching games.  The night we were there they had a band, good musicianship but poor singing.  bartenter was attentive. I would go again"}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is, that above all other food, I'm a huge wing fan.  I get them at every chance I get.  The buffalo ranch wings at Joey D's definitely make my top 5 list.   They were fried perfectly - crispy skin - and even though they weren't as saucy, the flavor of the sauce was just perfect.    They were even good the next day, albeit a bit less crispy.  I happened to be with a few other fellow 'yelpers' at dinner, so I'll let them review their own food/experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have a quick lunch with a colleague who recommended. Nice place, not very crowded and good service.   Had a special of the day: ravioli with grilled chicken. Very good red sauce and ravioli, chicken was kind of eh. It came with a thick piece of toasted Italian bread that was perfect with the meal."}
