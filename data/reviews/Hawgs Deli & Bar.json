{"text":"This place had potential.  I love the name and logo.  Sadly, I was let down.  It is hard core bar food.  Wings - mediocre, but I think they were frozen.  No blue cheese?  Wtf?  Only one house sauce?  Double Wtf?   Nachos - shredded chedder spread on top and broiled in oven, really?  Salsa from a jar, yuck.  Not very good.  Poutine - come on, this is Montreal.  Fries are frozen, gravy was tasteless --- cheese curds were okay.   Cheeseburger - decent but again just mediocre."}
{"text":"After a long day moving boxes on July first, we decided to try Hawgs Deli since it was on our way home. Boy were we disappointed. 

We ordered 2 burgers with the option to change fries for a poutine 3$ extra. Total was about 45$ for 2 burgers with side of poutine. No drinks.

Burger patty was not freshly made, definitely frozen bought at Costco or something. 

Burger bun was tasteless and dry. It was crumbling at each bite.

Poutine sauce tasted bland, probably canned or worse, one of those dry mixes you just add water.

Fries tasted unfrozen and bland. Definitely not home made.

Barely any cheese curds on the poutine. Counted maybe 7 chunks.

Only positive things out of this place would be that it was somewhat edible.

Never eating at that place unless they completely change the quality of the food. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"This is your typical bar food, everything from wings to burgers to pizza, they also serve breakfast 24h which is a plus. The decor inside is pretty nice but that doesn't make up for there lack luster food. 

I am also not a fan of there service, there really slow when it comes to bringing the bill. I would rather cross the street and go to \" Station des Sport same concept, food is a lot better and much more TV to catch the game."}
{"text":"Crazy good food! I had a waffle craving, so my bf google searched for a place that sounded right, and this was the best sounding one for the time of night that it was, since nobody in Montreal serves waffles when it's not during the breakfast hours. So we drove alllll the way there, and it was totally worth the distance. Great parking, cool atmosphere, clean, comfy seats, and very polite workers. The food was great! We ordered the pork ribs and waffles, to which they gave us extra plates so that we could divide our meals up. The ribs were baby back, and didn't come in a very large portion, but they were tasty still, not bad, nice sauce, and very tender meat, not too strong of a flavor, I've had better ribs before, I don't think I would order baby back ribs again from anywhere though, I like eating adults instead of infant animals, I just find the meat yielding and taste to be much better with fully grown adult animals anyway. The waffles were a really nice site to see. They came with a nice delicious whipped cream on the side, and 2 different \"sauces\"? one maple syrup, couldn't tell if it was authentic or the cheap fake stuff, but either way it was not enough for that size of a waffle. The other was that canned sweetened condensed milk, which tasted good, but not really something I'd expect from a restaurant... also wasn't enough for the size of waffle they made The waffle itself was a decent size, not big, but not small either, very nice texture, and was very yummy, but for the price, they should have given more food. The salad that came with the ribs was mostly lettuce, and not much other veggies. Would have been nice to have a decent amount of veggies to at least have enough of a nutritional daily value intake, but wtv, at least it was fresh veggies. The milkshakes were crazy good though. We ordered chocolate and Vanilla. I forget which, but one of them even had swirly chocolate syrup all around the glass inside, which really made the white shake stand out. We cleaned out plates, and didn't feel too full, which was nice I guess, really hit the spot, but I think I would rather make waffles at home once we find out waffle maker finally xp The waitress was very nice and friendly, and attentive. A very pleasant and good talker, I did find it a little strange at how much she was talking to my bf though, it made me feel a little awkward. I could tell that she was an honest and hard worker though, and it's probably normal for waitresses to talk to the person who's most likely paying in order to get a better tip, but eh... it's still very awkward and I didn't like that much. I did notice that there was a manager-type person going around helping the waitresses with their tables though, like they might have been understaffed for the late night shift. I like places with good managers like that, even though I don't work there, I'd at least like to eat at a good place, in and out."}
