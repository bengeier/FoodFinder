{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of restaurants all over the country, and I can say that my meal here was by far the worst I've ever had. The menu is limited, so I ordered what I thought would be something that is hard to hurt, a fish fry. What I received were pre-formed, frozen \"cakes\" that you could buy in your local frozen aisle. They were over-cooked on the outside, yet gummy and under-cooked on the inside. Yeah, gummy, not something that a fish dish should ever be. Obviously it was inedible. The side of fries was equally unappetizing, since they were greasy and undercooked as well. Oh, and not even hot. Needless to say, I'll never be eating here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went there to have dinner and watch the Cleveland Indians play off game. After ordering our food we realized that they didn't have the cable station to get the game on tv. Very bad for a bar in the Cleveland area!  The food also had an after taste and service not efficient. Forgot a beer and soup ordered before the meal. Needs major improvement. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We visit weekly, the staff is very friendly and they have a nice patio area. We very rarely eat there as the food is less than desirable."}
{"text":"The first time the other night wasn't bad, but it was late night.  Bad experience tonight as I sat at the bar for a solid 6 or 7 mins without even a \"hi\" or \"what are you drinking?\"  POOR service as the bartenders walked by several times.  I left and went to Ace's. If I could give it a 0, I would have based on tonight's experience."}
{"text":"I frequent this bar. What is nice is that the music is not too loud so you can carry on conversations easily. The food is good and the service is amazing. It's a great place to sit back and catch up with friends. I recommend it. Also they have a big bar so there is always somewhere to sit."}
{"text":"The food is homemade, delicious and reasonably priced. We came here after finding a groupon type deal, and have returned daily. The daily lunch special is $6.99 for half a (large) sandwich and cup (really a bowl) of soup. Today is the Easter Buffet, and we are looking forward to it, actually taking a friend to \"show it off\". Servers and employees are courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"bartenders are on point. servers do not seem to move with a purpose. their purpose should be customers but I think if they walked any slower they would be stopped. owner is very unprofessional especially towards women 1/3 of his age maybe 1/4. mussels are fantastic. spinach dip is also amazing. depends on who's cooking as to how the entrees taste. this review comes from food service background so take it as you may."}
{"text":"We used to love coming here.  The last 3 times we have been here the service has been terrible."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with whatever you get.   All the food is fantastic.     Plenty of seating. Friendly staff and very prompt in food prep and delivery."}
{"text":"I went to Lone Tree more for my friend performing (Kingtinued - An Elvis Show) than for anything else.    I ordered the Guinness Onion Rings.  Not that psyched on them, good flavor, just not my favorite.  Everyone else around me had a wide variety of their food and everyone loved it.  The only dissenter, was Dawn, a vegetarian.  She ordered the SaurKraut Balls.  Beware the saurkraut balls if you're a vegetarian!  There's corrned beef in them (not specified on the menu).  All in all, I'd say the food is slightly above average with good service and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been here twice recently and both times were great! I had the sea bass special that was wonderful and other people in my party had the burgers that were also very good. The best part is the price!"}
{"text":"not a fan... I had roast beef with swiss on a hammerer roll... the roast beef tasted bad... never ate it.  The french fry's were OK"}
{"text":"Lone tree is a great place to go for drinks and food. The service is excellent. My favorite place in north ridgeville"}
{"text":"the clams that I had were to \"die for\" they did not give me enough,I could have eaten about 2 or 3 more dozen of these that is how good they were. the Lake Erie Perch sandwich & dinner are wonderful & I do mean wonderful.  can't go wrong going here to eat. the service was good also considering on a Friday night they were jam packed & the waters & waitresses were really trying to keep up with the orders. I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The Lone Tree has an excellent bar and patio, definitely the best place in the area to hang out for a few drinks and enjoy the summer days.  The food used to be very excellent but much like Alexander's it went downhill over the years.  Everything now tastes like it was prepackaged and reheated.  The clams are always good, the crab legs are generally good but anything else off the menu appears to be frozen/packaged and no longer made onsite."}
{"text":"Gave it four tries and didn't like it.  Menu was deceiving, it looked like they attempted to offer good food, but they never delivered.  I went in there one night and they were blaring some ghetto rap so loud that my buddy and I left and went across the street.  If you choose to sit on their patio, be prepared to be ignored by the servers."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  Good food, good prices, and plenty of room. The service is good but not great...room for improvement.  They also have a great menu with tons of choices!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly directed at the service we received and the negligence of management to properly stock their kitchen...   I was talking to a friend about crab legs and he told me about Lone Tree Tavern.  My wife and I decided to give it a try.  We went at 8pm on a Sunday.  There are two entrances to the tavern.  One is marked tavern, the other is marked restaurant.  We were there to eat so you know which one we used.  The restaurant side was empty, except for one man. We stood there awkwardly for 5 minutes before a server shouted at us from the kitchen that someone would be right over. At this time, a party of 2 entered behind us.  After another 3 minutes we were approached and told to take whatever table we wanted and someone would be over to check on us.  I started my timer on my phone the second we sat down. After another 5 minutes at the table, with no menus, no silverware, no water, we see a server approach. What does she do?  She approaches the table of the people who came in after us, a party of 2 that was now a party of 6.  I can only imagine they were approached first because the server thought it would be a bigger tip.  10 minutes later, we were approached by what I assumed to be a bar back or bus boy who asked us if we needed anything.  I replied, \"some menus would be nice.\"  He laughed and returned with the menus, took our drink order, served those drinks, and said a server would be right over.  he apologized and said that the server had a big table with a bunch of children.  Now 18 minutes in, we get our server. I order the Ribeye Steak and the King Crab Legs at market price.  The waitress had to check on the price (shouldn't she know) and returned to tell us that...ready...they are out of crab legs!!!  That's why we came!!!  My wife and I laughed because we didn't think it could get any worse and the plane crashed into the mountain.  Now 20 minutes in, we politely told the server that we would finish our drinks and close our tab.  She apologized and said she felt terrible about our experience.  We tipped $3 on our $9 check and left.  That should have been a $90 check with a $20 tip.  We won't be back.  I am not tough to please.  We were the only people there.  There is no excuse for bad service when the place is empty.  Especially if you are trying to sell $30 dishes."}
{"text":"Had the stuffed cabbage special it was delicious.  Fast friendly service by Michelle and Rob.  I've had Michelle before is my server and she's been great.  I recommend going there never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Yeah I love this bar...wait that's a Toby Keith song.   Great draft list.  Spinach dip - great.  Fish and pirogi's - bomb.     Lots of TV's!  I'm down to come here anytime so let me know if you want to grab a beer at Lonetree!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Had to send a special drink back real weak but the bar redeemed themselves! Thanks Lone Tree ! Enjoy the North Ridgeville reunions that are held there."}
{"text":"Wow, wow,wow!!!  We had Burgers, fresh cut fries, BBQ Pork, Clam Chowder,cheesecake and a bottle of wine for under $50! Everything was delicious  Going back next Sunday"}
{"text":"Great place! My coworkers and I frequently stop here after our long 12 hr shifts and we are always greeted with friendly service and great food! We love the outdoor patio in the warmer weather. Just a nice, clean, well run establishment!"}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday with my wife and daughter after a soccer match.  We were pleased to find a nice outdoor patio and had a seat.  Service was spot on, the draft beer was refreshing, and the food excellent.  We will be back."}
{"text":"A group of us came here after our softball game at Victory Park.   They have a huge bar with heaps of seating and restaurant area which is good for groups.   I waited about 10 minutes for a drink at the bar - the lady bartender seemed overwhelmed and didn't have a good rotation going. She didn't move much from where she was standing and we kept getting passed up for drinks while others were not waiting as long. Sometimes it's hard to remember to keep walking in a clock or counterclockwise rotation to not miss new people.   Side note: a tall drink here comes in a 16oz glass. Fantastic! But 16 ounces is huge and I have no idea how many shots are in that (not complaining).   Our group sat at a table in the dinning room. Food came out fast and our server was friendly. He suggested I get the buffalo chicken wrap and substitute grilled chicken and get the hot sauce on the side. It was perfect! The ranch dressing was amazing. It was thick and tasted homemade. The fries where perfectly cooked and perfectly golden brown (clean fryer).    They have a lot of menu options - everyone at my table was happy with their food. Everything was reasonably priced too :)"}
{"text":"I'm dying for this place to make an upgrade in their food. It just doesn't seem to happen. Al should hire J Mraz back and he would make a fortune w all the loyal old Alexanders customers."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here - we have no complaints! Excellent service and the food was delicious. Try the gyro, you won't be disappointed. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate to say this, because we use to love this place! The Food sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't go here unless you are drunk and don't care if food is cold! We loved crablegs but they DON'T offer specials anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I use to praise here, but NOT anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't go here unless you are drunk and don't care what you drink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm a regular. But they constantly have CNN on because \"Ed\" watches it. Well tell \"Ed\" to go home and watch it! This channel is anti-Trump 99% of the time. I've left numerous times costing the bar $$$$ because I got sick of looking at it!! Get a life Ed! Also always check your bill. 3 Times I was over charged because they try to slip in an extra drink or two that you didn't have."}
{"text":"Found the spot on Yelp while passing through the area on Lon road trip.. Right off the highway. Far better choice than chain restaurants often found off highways. Good food and friendly service!! Reasonably priced too!"}
