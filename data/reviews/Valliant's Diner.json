{"text":"The food was good but we waited 40 minutes for our lunch. They were not busy at all!  The owner was hanging out with his family in the back area and came out a few times to the counter and eat his soup. The sad thing is that our server was so nice. Safe yourself the time and go to Kelly O's."}
{"text":"An awesome little diner I've been coming to since I was just a kid with my grandparents. The breakfast and lunch menu is great. Everything I've ever had was delicious and SO cheap. Two people can come in here and eat a massive breakfast for under 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for brunch at 11:50. It was busy, so I sat at the counter. The staff was very nice, but the service was unfortunate. I gave the waitress my order - two blueberry pancakes and two eggs. There were two cooks behind the counter and a lot of order tickets. I haven't worked in a restaurant, but I don't think that its very sufficient to complete one order at a time. Anyway, it was 12:45, and I had finished my orange juice and decided that an hour for pancakes and eggs was too long for me, so I paid for my orange juice, which I actually thought was going to be taken off of the tab due to the wait, but no, I paid my $1.75 for a small glass and politely told the waitress that I couldn't wait any longer. Of course, my \"order just went on the grill.\" I'm pretty sure that I didn't miss out on anything amazing."}
{"text":"Breakfast 10:30am on a weekday, not very busy.  Two omelettes, two sides, one coffee.  35+ minute wait for the food, $20 plus tip.  Food was so-so, omelette was very salty.   Go to Kelly Os."}
{"text":"Charming diner. Good service.  Food is just okay. Ordered home fries. The portion was about half a small plate. Very sad. Potatoes are inexpensive. Also were barely warm.  Room for improvement."}
{"text":"Sat for fifteen minutes in a half empty diner while two waitresses walked purposefully past us avoiding eye contact and served other tables that had arrived after us, apologizing for their (shorter) wait. We finally took our business elsewhere since it is apparently not needed here."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday morning. Place was pretty busy but several tables were open.  We sat there for about 15 minutes. Nobody approached us. An older gentleman, who is obviously a regular came in after us and was waited on and given coffee. Lots of staff shooting the breeze with regulars, nobody approached us. Mind you, this is not a big place.  When we thought about how long it's taking to get waited on, how long would it be until we were eating.  We left. Unless you're a regular don't wast your time."}
{"text":"Was here back in October on a Sunday and I had a great breakfast meal before it got busy.  My omelette and home fries were cooked well and great.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Honest diner food at a fair price. I am a big fan of their sausage and they have some of the best pancakes in Pittsburgh. A nice, family owned business. Yes, the service can be a bit slow at times, but if you are in that much of a hurry, hit the McDonalds drive thru.  Want to correct an earlier reviewer... there is an apartment above the restaurant, but the owner does not live there."}
{"text":"Got there a little after 10:30 and at 11:45 never got my food yet never was asked if I wanted a refill of coffee by my waitress or even checked on was walked by a could times and told them I'm leaving cause I didn't get my food after waiting 45 minutes"}
{"text":"They split the huge sausage links long ways then fry them.  Yum ... I could make a meal on the home fries. I don't think anything is broiled ... so take an aspirin with you.  They do breakfast and early lunch ... and then go home.  It is a family owned business.  See the write up in the Pittsburgh Tribune / Post Gazette ...   Every time the front door opens ... I look up expecting to see Fonzi coming through the door. The 50's decor is just right.  Parking is limited but the food is delicious.  The waitresses are wonderful.   I am very happy to see a non - chain mom and pop restaurant thriving."}
{"text":"A nice little diner. The service was friendly and fast, which was surprising since they were busy. The portions were huge! There are specials up on the board and they have good old-fashion meals like fried bologna. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast at around 10:30 this morning. The place was busy. It took about 15 minutes for the waitress to come to our table. Took about 45 minutes to get our food. We did think that the breakfast was great, however--one hour to get our food is way too long. I can't prove it, but as others have posted, I do believe that regulars get bumped to the head of the line. Were it not for the long wait, I would have given them 4 stars, but given the hour wait for food I am giving them 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place has two speeds slow and slower. Apparently the cook can't make two breakfast plates at the same time. Then the server gives us our cups and our glasses of water with her DNA all over the edge of the glass. When are these people going to learn how to serve customers cleanly and efficiently"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Yes, it can get busy on the weekends. But if you have the chance to go earlier on a weekday morning (they open at 6am), please do so. My usual menu selection is the Greek Omlet however I decided to try the Bologna Egg and Cheese sandwich this last time. Both items are highly recommended, delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We go almost every weekend.  Food is great.  Prices are cheap and the servers are the best...polite, friendly and attentive.  The kind of place they learn your name and bring you your drinks before you've ordered.  I wouldnt recommend it if you are in a rush on the weekends.  Its a popular place with a small kitchen.  Try the burger if you are there for lunch."}
{"text":"Ugh. I had heard such good things about Valliant's and will definitely give it another shot, but I have to say my first experience wasn't too great! My husband wanted to order the Steak and Eggs special, but they ran out. Our friends' kids we were dining with wanted hot dogs, but they ran out. I ordered a Pittsburgh-style salad with swiss cheese, chicken and of course french fries. The cheese was giant hard-to-eat slices, the lettuce was basically translucent and their ranch dressing wasn't very good. I love salads and I really had to force myself to eat this one. Additionally, our friends happened to stop here at the same time as us. They sat at the bar and no one came to take their order for more than 20 minutes. Eventually, they decided to keep waiting just to see how long it would take and to make a point, but how do customers go unattended for that long in such a tiny restaurant? How did none of the servers check on them? Blows my mind!"}
{"text":"First know this is seat yourself - this isn't posted in store but throws a lot of first time Boston's. Second this is a place with a lot of long time local customers who will get served before you so don't freak out. Typical diner fare at a cheap price and decent flavor. Enjoyed how low key it was. Plenty of parking in the rear if needed."}
{"text":"Cute little 50's diner with great food and service. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs without even having to ask and also since she was the only waitress on staff at the time. The food was delicious and large in portion."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today for lunch with my father and goddaughter.  We had both driven by Valiants many times in the past and for some reason had never gone so I was happy to oblige him whenever he expressed an interest.  Whenever we got there the parking lot was mostly full, both front and back and I think we got the last spot.  We then walked around the restaurant and went in and seated ourselves in a booth.  The inside of Valiants looks like how you would picture an old diner complete with lunch counter, checkboard floors, 50's/60's pictures on the wall (Elvis, Betty boop, Marilyn Monroe and other diners) and interesting colored mint green booths.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the Valiant burger with a side of fries.  According to the menu, the burger was an 8 oz party with Swiss cheese, grilled peppers, onions and mushrooms.  It ended up taking a pedestrian 30 minutes from ordering until it got to our table which I normally wouldn't mention but with a somewhat fussy 1 year old at our table, it felt longer.  Honestly I wasn't expecting much from it due to its price ( less than $6) and the 2.5 star Yelp rating for Valiants.  So I was pleasantly surprised whenever I bit into the burger and I thought it was actually quite good.  It was larger than I expected as well with ample toppings and a nice layer of Swiss on the top.  The only part that could have used improvement was the bun.  While it was toasted it could have been toasted longer as the bun ended up being soggy and fell apart whenever I ate it.  Their fries were crinkle cut and came out piping hot and tasted pretty good.  When eaten plain they could have used some more salt but whenever I added Franks red hot to them I was happy.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Even though our order took a little longer than we hoped, the food was good and the prices are too."}
{"text":"Slow service. Typical diner food. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice little place, friendly staff and attentive. Everything is always really good,  the fish sandwich was disappointing.  Just fish on bread.  Could use a little work! Over all a nice experience very cousy and efficient for a staff that small."}
{"text":"Pathetic service!!!  Will never go back.  Eggs OK, bacon OK, but undercooked potatoes are what ruined my meal other than the poor lazy service from wait staff."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a few times and today we decided to give it a try.  The service was very slow, the food took even longer.  I had a ham and cheese omelette and my ham was charred and the omelette tasted so so.  It's a cute diner but the menu selection for breakfast is ok.  Just simple things like pancakes, French toast, eggs, and omelettes.  It's not spectacular like a few other places around town.  I don't think we will be going back.  The waitresses don't really pay attention and don't come around very often."}
{"text":"Valliant is awesome.  It has such a great, classic diner feel, and the food is insanely inexpensive for the price.  The servers are extremely friendly too, and talk to you like family.    This is a family-run diner, and don't expect the service to be too quick - the kitchen can get busy and they often do not have that many cooks behind the counter.  But the food and service have not let me down yet.  Everyone I've ever been here with always orders eggs or an omelet, so I can't speak of much else, but everything is always great."}
{"text":"Raw pancakes, hard home fries and a waitress that only talks to you if you're a regular... Not heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was soo poor. People who came in after us ate and left. Another group was half done eating when we inquired about our food. When the waitress came back from checking we were told they just put it on the grill. We told her we were leaving. The last time I ate here the service was slow too. It seems that REGULARS slips get to jump the line. Just saying. Went to Eat N Park from order to food (they were busy too) was 16 minutes."}
{"text":"A quaint, retro-style diner with bright colors and 1950's decor.  The food is inexpensive but good.  We stopped in for breakfast and the bacon was perfectly cooked, omlettes were stuffed with veggies and cheese (I had the Greek), and the waitstaff was quick and friendly.   Soups are homemade and they had ham & bean on special today."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite breakfast joints. Their food is exactly what you'd hope for from diner. Amazingly priced, tasty, and plenty of coffee to go around.  I'm a fan of the basics, two eggs over easy, corned beef hash, toast and potatoes or pancakes (depends on how I feel that day). All that and a cup of coffee for around 10 bucks. Can't beat it!  I will say that service can be slow from time to time, but they are always friendly polite. This may not be the place to get breakfast if you are in a rush, but on the days you can take a few minutes to relax and enjoy your cup of coffee, I recommend stopping in and giving this place a try.  You may want to carpool as parking can be tight on the weekend, but there's usually enough room to find a spot."}
