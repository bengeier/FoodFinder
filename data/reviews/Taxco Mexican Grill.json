{"text":"I'm goin middle of the road on this one.  I like the food but the sponge painting on the walls in bright blue is a bit distracting.  They have a great patio in front of a pond with a water thingy, the patio is nice and relaxing.  I got the naked burrito, it's big enough to share and for 8 bucks I can put up with the funky decor.  It's never crowed and on a Friday night at 9PM when you are starved to death cuz your lame duck boyfriend fell asleep and almost missed Friday night date night...(I digress) it was great to get speedy service.  The beer was cold and that worked for me.  So, it's not the Birk. but you can't beat the prices and the service and food is very good.   I am a fan."}
{"text":"Pretty good. About as good of food as Tex-Mex can be.  Sparse but clean interior. Good tasting and large but expensive top shelf margaritas  (not a bad value, but never objectively low priced)."}
{"text":"Great food/drink for the price. The staff are welcoming and professional plus the place is decorated well.  Food is basic, yes, but it's fresh and portioned large for the price and the margaritas are amazing."}
{"text":"I love this little place.  Foods cheap, very good (not outstanding) but they offer you unlimited refills on the tostada chips.    The owners are very friendly and always greet you on the way in and out.  They also have mariachi night!  For a good cheap lunch, this place is tops on exit 25."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.  Their lunch menu is very reasonably priced with many different combinations.   I have been here many times and have always been greeted with a smile.  The chips and salsa are delicious and the salsa has a kick.  The wife and I enjoy the Fajitas which is an enormous portion.  $2 drafts were the special today and I said yes please!"}
{"text":"No. Meal was bland and almost  certainly out of a can or frozen. Beans were a tasteless runny mess. The rice reminded me of boil in a bag. Don't get me started on the stringy chicken with no seasoning what so ever. Even the guacamole was processed,  not fresh.  Not at all what food, should be. Most definitely not Mexican. Find a better choice."}
{"text":"Taxco mexican restaurant, 9719 Sam Furr Rd, Ste E, Huntersville, NC, charged me 8.25% sales tax for my dinner tonight. I queried the waitress when I noticed the error, I was impolitely told, \"That's just the way we do it here!\" I showed her the correct sales tax rate (7.25%) from the Internet, and asked her how long this practice had been in effect, the waitress said,\"As long as I've been here, more than a year.\" They made no effort to correct this egregious, illegal error. Beware!!"}
{"text":"This is your typical Mexican Restaurant you find in any strip mall, but it's all Belmont has and it works for me. Service is always good and food is fast. The there's a brown sauce dish (Mole?) that is served over pork has a hint of cinnamon maybe but it is awesome. I tried it once recently after eating here plenty of times and it has become my new go to dish. My one complaint here and for every Mexican place is that they never or only describe a few of the dishes. There are so many things they have but half of it I have no idea what it is or how it's made. Needs some definitions for those Mexican dishes on that menu."}
{"text":"Awesome place for authentic Mexican. Chips and salsa are fabulous. Chicken fajitas are a good ratio of veggies to meat. Great service. Very attentive. I drive past 5 other Mexican places just to come here. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"The service was ok. Our waiter was not very helpful and did not bring the salad that was included with meal.. we had to ask for it.. maybe this was because it was Sunday at 8pm... not that impressed with the place and service."}
{"text":"Food edible at best. Being from California this is the most flavorless food I have ever had.  Service is always great but having been sick after latest 3 times we ate there (forced cause it was with family) we shall not be back again.  They have service ONLY going for them.  Sorry folks"}
{"text":"Most recent visit had a couple of hiccups.   The cheese Queso dip was cold and the service was very slow.  They brought my kids food out 10 minutes before my wife and my meal.  I absolutely Hate this.  What kind of loser parent needs their kids meal out first, my kids behave and we eat as a family."}
{"text":"My new favorite authentic Mexican restaurant!!!!  I wish we could take it back to MADISON, WI when we return.  The flavors were wonderful!  Everything was fresh'. Everyone at the table was happy!"}
{"text":"I tried Taxco for dinner a few days after it opened.  The decor was comfortable Mexican but not too tacky.  Plenty of tables to handle the dinner rush.  I ordered the large combination of tex mex fare.  The food came quickly and was hot.  Unfortunately the flavor was bland.  I was hoping it would be spicy with some heat.  The meat in each dish lacked spices, almost to the point of being plain hamburger in the burrito and tostada.  Even the chile poblano had no heat whatsoever.  The margaritas were excellent and reasonably priced.  The service was also excellent.  I will be going back and trying some of the more traditional Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Best Mexican style food for the price in the whole area. Don't listen to reviews about its not \"Birkdale\" or \"I lived in Mexico and this isn't authentic\".  Great staff and super friendly."}
{"text":"Have been to Taxco many times and generally feel the food is a good and reasonably priced.  However, went to dinner with my husband and we placed a to go order at the beginning to be ready for when we would leave.  She totally forgot, and then after putting in the order at the end of our meal we waited 40 mins before it came out. During that 40 min wait we were told the food would be right out.  After complaining to manager requesting a discount they refused and the only explanation provided was that they were dealing with a large party.  NOT MY PROBLEM!   LEARN HOW TO MANAGE YOUR SERVICE BETTER OR YOU WONT BE IN BUSINESS LONG!"}
{"text":"Not an awesome facility and not trendy.  I thnk this place is a sleeper.  Its a low key place with good service and much better than average food for the prices."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem.  I found the service to be excellent and the food to be solid.  One review said the salsa had no flavor. I strongly disagree, bet salsa I have had in a long time.  I will be coming back.  This place does not deserve 3.5 stars.  Give it a try.  It's down  home Mexican food nothing fancy - just the way  I like it.  You snobs out there need to get a life ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican  places around! They are the only place my picky husband likes. He can get grilled chicken nachos without the pepper/onions most places put on nachos. I love the chile  poblano. Best around!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Only bad thing was our fault, we got food to go!  I would have much rather eaten this food at the restaurant so it maintained its freshness!    Flavor was great on everything. We will definitely be going back and making this a regular spot. Forgot to mention the happy hour specials are awesome too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. I ordered the tamales which were terrible mostly it was the corn flour hardly any meat inside maybe a tablespoon. And it was ground beef instead of brisket as it is traditionally cooked."}
{"text":"Do not go here anymore! I live in the neighborhood and went to get to-go food and they have decided to change the prices on everything. I was charged  25 cents for each ITEM I ordered to-go as a fee This place had really gone down hill since Edgar left, and there are always young kids bartending who ignore customers and have their friends at the bar drinking. I'm sad to see what has happened to this place."}
{"text":"Love love love. Family favorite place. Everyone is always so nice, external quick service, very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place always makes me happy. I would consider myself a regular. I usually sit at the bar and watch some soccer when I have some time at lunch. All the servers know me by name. Good drinks, Good food and the salsa is incredible. I like the \"local\" feel. Reasonable prices. Consistantly good food."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch.  We have eaten here dozens of times in the past.  Chips were good and salsas roja and verde were good.  My chile relleno was cooked to perfection.  My husbands fajitas were decent.  Overall a nice place."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Charlotte! I've brought at least 6 different people on different occasions and they've all said the same... absolutely delicious!  I always order the quesadilla fajitas and a side of their queso... never disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Taxco several times as I work nearby. The food is very tasty and the staff is always super friendly. The food comes out fast and is reasonably priced, especially the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised given the location.  The service was excellent and the salad ingredients were fresh and crisp.  The food was plentiful and well prepared.  We ate here twice the week we were staying in the area and will go again if we return."}
{"text":"Guacamole is great - much better than some other local Mexican restaurants.  And the chicken soup is also a fave. Other than that the rest of the food is just ok in my opinion. I usually get the shredded chicken soft tacos with pico and there have been many times that they're delicious and then others they have no flavor. The staff is very nice and always great service."}
{"text":"I decided to eat at Taxco because of the great food and margaritas that I have had there plenty of time before. As a good friend of mine and myself are eating, our server comes up and asks us if we are done. First of all, not really the way to approach customers who are clearly not even close to finished with their meals or drinks. We politely tell him no and inform him that we plan on getting one more margarita before we are finished. He begins questioning us in a really weird manner and walks away. This automatically made us feel uncomfortable. But the next thing that happens is what is going to prevent me from ever stepping foot in this establishment again. We are still sitting there, questioning the situation that just happened when we are approached by the manager. He starts questioning us and our judgment abilities. He tells us that we don't look like we were 26 or born in 1985. We look at him and tell him he was misinformed because we were born in 1995 and we are 21 so if we were born in 1985, we wouldn't even be 26, we would be 31. Things started to get really uncomfortable at this point. We were the only people in the restaurant at this time and we felt as though we were being interrogated. He stood there a little bit longer just kind of looking at us making us feel weird. The server comes back out and the manager begins to walk away but the both of them automatically begin speaking Spanish behind our backs knowing we wouldn't be able to understand them. This place may have good food, but the service is absolutely terrible and so is the management. This is the most unprofessional place I have ever gone to and it sparked me creating a Yelp account to show my horrible and uncomfortable experience to others. I was judged, watched and talked about by the manager and staff. I spent very good money there and am appalled how they treat good customers. We also only had about half of a smaller margarita at this point so completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"It is your typical Mexican restaurant. The service is ok, the food was ok but the location is nice close to the fountain. Thats all not much to say about this place."}
{"text":"We love taxco! We come here regularly, and they have never disappointed us. The drinks are amazing, the food is awesome and the staff is so sweet."}
{"text":"Don't go.  Food was horrible.  It all tasted like spaghetti o's.  My \"salad\" was just shredded iceberg ..so disappointed.  Waiter was nice and polite."}
{"text":"On Sat 5/6/17, we decided to follow someone's suggestion and try Taxco Mexican Grill.  After seeing the bad reviews that were left on 5/5/17 - which is surely their busiest day of the year - we went anyway.  Great decision!!  They were NOT busy since apparently everyone was there the day before!!! Therefore, we had excellent service, a great pitcher of top-shelf margarita, and good food. Their salsa isn't really spicy, but still good, and I truly did like the fact that they bring a smaller basket of chips - unlike many restaurants that will load you up with them.  My husband had the grilled chicken salad and I had a 2 choice combination: 1 chorizo taco and a chile poblano with rice & beans.  Both of our dinners were very good, and we had a good time.  :D"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Service was great! Food was excellent. Best mexican restaurant i have been to in a very long time. Will most definatly be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times and they have your standard mexican fair pretty much. The soft tacos are the best menu item I have had and you can get a pretty decent variety to choose from. The one downside is that one of the tacos I picked out, the chorizo, was absolutely horrible. After a couple bites I could tell something was off with the meat and let the waitress know. She knocked a few dollars off my tab which was nice but in all honesty I was just trying to help spare the next unfortunate soul who ordered this in case they needed to make some changes back in the kitchen. The second time I went there we ordered some chips and queso and the queso was served up in a tiny side cup which for the 3$ left you thinking \"really?\". I probably won't go back here unless I am absolutely stuck in Mint Hill and need a taco fix."}
{"text":"I love Taxco! It is our first choice for Americanized Mexican in the area. I rate it five stars for the consistent service, quality of the food, and overall value. Their lunch specials are great and are always served so quickly, which is nice when you don't have long for a lunch break. However I've never felt rushed on a weekend when we order cheese dip and drinks."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant! The vegetarian fajitas are delicious and the queso is so addicting. It's become my favorite comfort food! The staff is also super sweet. Definitely visit!"}
{"text":"I've traveled to Mexico quite a few times, and this place is the most authentic within the Charlotte area. For the price you pay, you can eat for 2 nights after! I get the pollo blanco with flour tortillas. Service is awesome. You get your food within 10 mins of ordering busy or not. They have a live mirachi band (however you spell that) about once a month. That's always a fun time."}
{"text":"The service here has been outstanding each of the three or four times I have come to Taxco. The food is fine, solid, not very imaginative, but I've found a couple of things on the menu I enjoy pretty well. They make tasty Horchata (rice milk drink with cinnamon)! I don't think that's on the menu, but you can order it! I also like that the restaurant is nicely decorated and pleasant to be in. Good place to go when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a birthday party today and wanted Mexican. It was good & just exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican restaurant in town!  This spot is family run and family friendly (also offering a small bar side for adults and outdoor seating). They use real mexican cheese; unlike some local competitors ;) Drinks specials offer the best beer deals in town and the salsa is delish. If you like things hot - ask for their special hot sauce (tip: a little goes a loooong way!)  Their housemade soups are great and they use the freshest, perfectly ripe avocados too!"}
{"text":"This is actually the first time I have written a food review. I was really excited to see a Mexican restaurant coming to this area.I have a few guys I work with that live in the Cornelius area that have eaten at that location and said good things about it,especially the Margaritas.We tried Taxco 12/24/12. The inside was done nicely to suit a Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were good not great. Unfortunatley the Margarita was on the bottom of the list with worst ever and we actually ordered top shelf. I ordered the Cesina as the menu description looked really good. The steak was honestly so thin there would have been no way to cook it and it not be completely dry and it lacked any taste at all. The plate came with rice, not much taste at all,re-fried beans,more soup like,and a small bowl of lettuce with only a few diced tomatoes and onions on top. It looked unappetising and tasted about the same. The service was so that they actually brought each one at the table their food seperately about 2 minutes apart on each.I really want to like this place as it is minutes from our house. I think I will give it another chance and try a more commonly ordered dish. As far as the Margaritas I would recommend passing on, even if they were free.I will review again if I re-visit."}
{"text":"Mexican food is definitely in my top 3 for favorite foods.  maybe because I think I'm fluent en español ...My coworkers and I have been meaning to try a Taxco and almost missed out due to thinking it was some tax joint haha. So anyway...I usually stick to fajitas when I eat Mexican but today I decided to live a little ...and boy was it worth it!!! I ordered arroz con pollo and my gosh it was delicious! I have only had authentic arroz con pollo and this was pretty close!!! I forgot to even snap a pic because I demolished it so quickly. Don't worry I'll be back I'm sure!! Good food good company!"}
{"text":"Update from 2014: the last several times the service has been lackluster. They aren't rude, they just never come back to check on you. Once at the most. Thankfully, the rude woman has been gone for about a year. But the current staff don't seem very well trained in how to wait tables -- you're lucky if they return one time before you get the tab. If it wasn't convenient & the food wasn't good, I'd never go back. The tip I leave is going to start to reflect the poor service. They don't even deserve 15%. And SO GLAD they got rid of that mariachi band :)."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is always good and the staff is always warm and friendly. We ask for recommendations for new things to try and their recommendations are always excellent."}
{"text":"We have since had a bad takeout experience. Food was not as good. We ordered soup and I didn't see it in the bag but they assured me it was in there. When I got home and unpacked it, surprise! It wasn't there but I got charged for it. Take out service was kinda rude. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good hidden gem inside of the Target shopping center in Huntersville. We came here after having a bad experience at a seemingly more popular Mexican restaurant in the area.  Our service here was great, quick, and kind. I have one small concern however, that is the return time for food ordered. Typically I have a problem with food coming out five minutes after I order. To me that screams \"microwaved\". However, I will say the food did not taste microwaved.  I wouldn't say \"fresh\" but it wa better than expected. Nothing too different from your typical Mexican restaurant these days, but after the experience we had down the road, it was a wonderful trip back to good service.  Every member of the waiting staff talked to us at some point of our visit.   We will definitely return here if we are looking for a quick \"south of the border\" meal. Four stars mainly for the service!"}
{"text":"We've been to Taxco three or four times now and we've never been disappointed.  The restaurant is located in a dingy strip mall and doesn't look the most appealing from the outside but the inside has an open feel with a decent-sized dining area and a small bar area and it's decked out in the usual Mexican decor.    My favorite thing about Taxco is its consistency.  We always know what kind of food and service we'll get here.  The wait staff is pleasant and the food is always fresh and tasty.  Like every Mexican restaurant they serve chips and salsa while you're waiting on your food.  The chips aren't the best quality but I always enjoy the salsa, it has just the right amount of hotness to it.  I always go with one of the enchilada meals with a beef, chicken, and cheese enchilada that comes with rice and refried beans.  Their food always hits the spot when I need a Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Came to this place once when I recently moved to Mint Hill a year and a half ago. Coming from California I know what real Mexican food tastes like. The chips and salsa that were given to my husband and I seemed like they came straight out from a bag and the salsa from a jar. The food was dry and bland. Never came back to this place and never will."}
{"text":"This is a solid Mexican restaurant. The location by the fountain is very nice so eating outside could be a nice option. The menu was very standard. Service was quick. I tried the beans and guacamole dip. Both were average. The price was average as well."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service. They have an extensive vegetarian menu which is a nice break from the typical \"side salad solution\" at most restaurants. I thought the food was very flavorful and the restaurant looks clean enough. That said, the recent 95.0 sanitation rating leaves a little to be desired. Good lunch choice - particularly for the \"meat averse\".  While maybe not the most authentic or the absolute best Mexican you're ever going to find, the food is good and it's an excellent choice for lunch and an alternative that's sorely needed in Mint Hill. I really hope this restaurant works out where so many others have failed in the same space."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food good. I'm so used to the food we get near home that I was disappointed by the small portions and the bland flavor. I would pass if I had the chance to go there again."}
{"text":"The go to local place for cantina cuisine. Attentive wait staff, clean environment, never  a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Good food, authentic and plentiful. Fair prices and excellent selection. A neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"I usually take my wife here for lunch because it's close to her office. The chips and salsa are really good. We normally keep it simple and order cheese quesadillas with beans and fried rice. Have also ordered tacos and buritos before. The food has always been delicious but the wait staff are horrible. Generally wait forever for your waiter to bring a refill. There will be 3 standing around doing nothing but your person is no where to be found. You think they would help each other out but they will look the other way if you make eye contact. It's ridiculous and we have actually stopped going there for a while. The management need to make sure their staff takes care of the customer. We have less than an hour, don't have time to wait the whole time for a refill."}
{"text":"This is how a place should be!  You walk in, and the decor is \"eh\".... Usually that means the food is amazing because they are spending all of their money and focus on the food! The staff was so friendly!!!  We ordered the enchiladas and they were HUGE! We also started with some guac, and boy that was the best decision!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican Food, though not on par with other Mexican restaurant Azteca- Matthews, NC. Taxco- Mint Hill has a nice family atmosphere and great wait staff that make the visit to the restaurant worth while. Take out orders processed very quickly. Have gone several times."}
{"text":"Really poor, slow, unprofessional service weather it be fine in or take out. Had a take out order that took over 45 minutes, when I called to check in on it the manager was extremely rude and hung up on me. Food was cold and soggy. Too many other options for Mexican food to waste time with this place."}
{"text":"Had burrito fundidos and gordo burrito plater for lunch this afternoon. Service was friendly, food was hot and fast. Nice place at a fair price. Chips were warm but a little stale - queso sauce really helped.  We will go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVE! this place.  Not exactly sure about these other reviews, but maybe they are not ordering the spicy dishes because they have some!  I personally think they have some of the best fish tacos in the area, though they don't push them so much.  My husband thinks the carne enchilda and carnitas are terrific.  We don't order \"regular Mexican\" fare too often so can't speak for the regular tacos, burritos and such.  However, I do enjoy the enchilada verde.  And for the price, you CANNOT BEAT the price for margaritas.  I get top shelf and they are yummy.  Best mix I've ever had."}
{"text":"In town for work and craved mexican.  Good meal with good margharitas and large pacifico  beer.  Good service too."}
{"text":"Don't let the small shopping center fool you. This Mexican restaurant is legit. Excellent vegetarian options for my wife. The queso and salsa are delightful. The service is fast and friendly. Highly recommend and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Having lived in the NYC metro area I was in search for authentic Mexican bistec tacos in the heart of NC suburbia. This place failed. Typical Taco Bell style. No onion, no cilantro, no tomatillo sauce. Wasn't expecting much since the area is still on the come up of diversifying. The camarones with fresh cilantro, tomato and onion served over a crispy tortilla is the jammy jam though. It's like ceviche."}
{"text":"There really isn't much I can say that Chad E. didn't say. I think his review is absolutely spot on. The service is great, friendly staff that are quick and constantly kept the refills coming. The location is ok, the decor is ok, everything is ok. Large portions, not too expensive, but the food tastes a little bland. Certainly not bad, but as Chad said, a bit lacking. Everything lacks flavor and tastes the same. That being said, it wasn't a bad experience. I suggest trying Taxco if you're in the Mint Hill area and want Mexican, but don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Not the best food or ambience. The restaurant was not clean either. Safe to say won't be going back"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the prices are great. I travel to Mexico a lot, so I asked the staff to make it Mexican spicy and they did. The staff is great and give great service. The tortilla soup is excellent and makes a meal for less than $5. They have beer special on Dos X.  The naked burrito is excellent. My only complain is they don't have chicken alambre dish."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here! And couldn't leave  without writing a review. Their service was wonderful and the food was even better. The choripollo was excellent big portions for under 8 bucks. Great lunch specials can't wait to come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"Consistently good \"American\" style Mexican food. Great salsa for the chips."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away but it's close to my parent's and a decent option for carry out Mexican in Belmont. It's a strip mall Ameicanized Mexican joint.   That should be everything you need to know about what to expect."}
{"text":"Good food! Different but closest to Mexican food like in California. Would go again."}
{"text":"It's absolutely not fair for me to rate a Mexican restaurant because I basically don't like Mexican food. They decorated this place to look like what the average American would picture a restaurant looks like in Mexico. There was a wanted poster of Poncho Villa above or table. The waitress wasn't terrible but was not what I would call a pro. We were about 3/4 through our food and she asked us if we needed anything wrapped to go. The restaurant was 2/3 empty, they didn't need the table. I ordered a combo plate 1-chimichanga 1-Burrito 1-Taco - Rice and beans. Beef in taco was terrible! I enquired what they put on top of the chimichanga and burrito. She said their red sauce and cheese. I asked them to put very little on . The plate was covered with both. I honestly think it wasn't the kitchen, our server was  somewhere else.  I will go back do to 43 years of marriage. This time NO cheese or sauce.  Prices are right, the drinks are right, plenty of parking so try it."}
{"text":"Clean Fresh Taste with an introduction to Mexican Cuisine I am not used to.  I've dined here a couple of times for lunch but last night was the first time for dinner.  Walked in and were prompt seated by a server I call the Energizer Bunny. Constantly in motion the whole time committed to his customers  We had been shopping for a new Washing Machine so it was after 7:30 pm when we got there.  It's well after the normal dinner trade and considering the bar, a little surprised they wre not more active.  We were seated and menu offered along with the perfunctory chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and no hint of oiliness and the salsa was the smooth type (I prefer chunky) but a good fresh taste and a good amount of heat.  Portion size was very large. They don't kid around with this.  Got our beverage order and time to place out order. Bear in mind my wife is not normally a fan of Mexican Cuisine   She ordered the Chicken Quesadilla with Rice and loved it. Not as spicy as she expected with a great balance of taste and texture.  Rice was one of her favorites.  I was a little bit more adventurous and ordered as an appetizer, although it does not show  up as an appetizer.  Coctel de Camarones or in other words, Mexican Shrimp Cocktail.  Not at all like anything I have had before. Looked up the recipe and it's shrimp in a base of  Clamato or V8 thicken with Ketchup to form a light gelatinous base with a bit of heat along with onions, celery, avocado, cilantro  etc  Different taste and texture than I was expecting but good with nice contrast of taste and textures. Not originally a fan of the semi-gelatinous consistency but it grows on you.  Would order again.  For my entree, I had the more conventional  Tostadas de Camarones which is a more conventional shrimp,onions tomato, lettuce, cilantro open faced sandwich.  End result is a delicious entree. Simple but elegant with a fresh taste that permeated the dish.  Totally enjoyable dining experience.  Service is great in a nice relaxed atmosphere.  My wife who does not like Mexican  Cuisine loved this place. What more can I say"}
{"text":"My GF lives in the area and I was wanting some Mexican food. After reading the reviews I was a little iffy on going here but decided to try it.   Saturday evening and we walk in to an empty restaurant, we were the only people there besides the staff. That should have been a sign to leave but we stayed.   The chips and salsa was bland. Most of the Mexican restaurants have similar salsa but theirs lacked flavor.   She went for fajitas trying to play it safe and the meat was so over cooked you could barely chew it. She didn't eat a 1/4 of her meal.   I got a less than spectacular chimichanga and chile poblano. Rice was on and the runniest refried beans I have ever seen.   Unfortunately we will not return. We didn't complain or want anything for free. The server got his tip as service was great (hence we were the only ones there) and he was nice."}
{"text":"Good, absolutely standard American-Mexican menu at good prices with fast service. No surprises one way or another. No hesitation to return."}
{"text":"First time here.  Not really wowed.  Nice servers, but speak little English.    I got the Grande burrito which had beef, fajita veggies, topped with red sauce, shredded lettuce, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Eh.  Beans are beans, nothing special there, rice was bland and lacked flavor.  The beef was tough, veggies were well seasoned and tasty though.   Salsa was pretty good, a little on the spices side, chops not really warm and seemed somewhat stale."}
{"text":"When i first saw the signs for a place called Taxco opening up this time of year, i thought it was some new business here to do my taxes. Fortunately for me, it turned out to be a nice little Mexican restaurant since i was just saying how i didn't have a go-to Mexican restaurant in the area.   Upon seating we were greeted with the chips and a nicely spiced salsa. We were given two separate bowls and a thing to pour salsa for ourselves. They had what appeared to be a wide selection of food choices, but we ordered off the combo lunch menu. The #3 came with an enchilada and burrito with your choice of either rice OR beans. Since having just one or the other is not an option for us, i recommend getting the beans with your meals and then ordering a side of rice to split. (The side of rice is 15 cents cheaper than the side of beans...yes i am a cheap bastard). At least it would have been enough for us to split. Not knowing we both ordered a side.   We had read the review for the Huntersville location that said the food was bland, but we thought all the food was great and we will be back."}
{"text":"My first time in Huntersville to buy a car ended with a nice meal at Taxco. The food was fresh and tasty. It was a good choice for dinner before heading back to SC."}
{"text":"Food was very good. The service was fast and friendly. The price is on par with most Mexican restaurants. The restaurant was clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Love it! Everything I've had is good. The staff is so accommodating and patient. The food is such good quality and on a consistent basis! That can be hard to find no matter what the food type. Every person I've brought here locally comes back. One note: They're slammed for lunch (mainly because they're so good!) so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant for the past 4 years. Lately it's been going downhill. A lot of the food has no taste or an \"ok\" taste. Nothing so delicious that I would crave the next day. I kept trying for months just to make sure the Chef was having an off day, but that wasn't the case. I'm not sure if it's someone else cooking or if they just don't care anymore. Now I only come here to pick up chicken soup, which is excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chicken fajitas- the peppers and onions were cut into \"manageable\" sized pieces, the chicken wasn't dry, tortillas were warm and chewy, and the sour cream wasnt runny (like some restaurants have it...weird.)  The staff was friendly, service was quick.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Definitely the family's favorite Mexican restaurant and frankly in the top threeover all being Caruso's, Capital Grille & Taxco! The service is always warm and friendly. The decor is simple but clean. The margaritas are tasty and are a very generous size. I suggest the top shelf with the Grand Marnier floater. The food is simply out of this world. Just had the tacos and had a variety with the grilled fish, Pollo Asada, and the Pescar. Very family-friendly."}
{"text":"Salsa is great to start. The courses were delicious and came out quick and correct. Service was amazing and everyone was very nice! Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, it's so hard to find good Mexican food out here.  If you ever go to San Diego, try Mexican food.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Anyways, we've tried many places in the Charlotte/Huntersville area and have been disappointed.  The salsa they serve with the chips are usually pretty close to ketchup.  No depth of flavor to any of the sauces.    And now we finally tried Taxco.  The restaurant is pretty much a big open space with a bar by the front door.  The chips and salsa were served and I was hesitant so my husband tried it first.  He said it had a little kick to it.  I gave it a try and it actually did have a little kick to it.  It also had good flavor.  I asked for their Verde salsa and that was spicier and even more flavorful.    I ordered the crab enchiladas which were listed under the Vegetarian dishes.  They were served with rice and beans.  The crab was imitation crab.  It wasn't bad but it should have been listed as imitation on the menu.  First time I've ever had an imitation crab enchilada.  My husband had the beef burrito and chicken chimichanga combo.  He enjoyed both although he said the burrito was more like an enchilada.    Service was good and fast.  We will definitely be back and I'll try something new next time."}
{"text":"We had visited here years ago (maybe different restaurant or owner?) and were not happy.  Years went by and we finally tried it again a couple weeks ago b/c there aren't many Mexican restaurants in our immediate area.  I'm so glad we did!! We've been back multiple times since!  The food is delicious, has some good options and the waitstaff/hostess are always pleasant!"}
{"text":"Great Service. Excellent food at very good prices. Love their margaritas and fajitas. Authentic mexican food. They have a seating area and a full bar."}
{"text":"It's a Sunday afternoon and I decided to take kids here for dinner. So far our dining experience was good until today. I ordered a Bistec a la Tampiqueña. The steak was not what I am used to. Not what my husband had in our last visit. This was a barely grilled ribeye steak. Tasted \"poached\". What I am used to is a big strip of skirt steak nicely charred grilled with a piece of cheese melted on top. The rice and beans tasted generic. Nothing like our previous visit. I even ordered a piña colada and it was horrible. I asked the waitress if the drink was made fresh, fresh pineapples at least. She said it is just a standard mix they use. Well now I know they don't make fresh fruity drinks at their bar. I get really bent out of shape when I spend $$$ on food that is not good. This was a very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I LOVE going out for Mexican food.  We decided to give this place a try and it was pretty descent.  Salsa is spicy & cheese dip is basic cheese dip- nothing fancy.  We love our spinach quesaDILLAS and these are by far the best we have had in Charlotte.  Well, Mint Hill too;)  Took a while for someone to come to our table but I wouldn't say the service is either bad or great.  They DO have great drink specials."}
{"text":"Enchiladas mexicanas, they were ok, nothing special. Sauce tasted a little funky, and my rice was hard either not cooked or cooked a few days ago."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town.  There pablano peppers are incredible.  Great service. Fair prices. Our favorite."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always good food great service and reasonably priced. I love how clean it is too. It has been a staple for me and my family every since I moved to North Carolina. I even have family who travels and every time they visit they request we come to Taxco. Can't say enough positive things about this place."}
{"text":"It's not the best Mexican restaurant I've been to but we don't have a whole lot of selection in Belmont... So it will do in a pinch if that's really what you want... Provided you don't feel like driving to Charlotte (or to Gastonia - Tequila's is good). They have your standard American/Mexican fare and a few specialties. Enchiladas, tacos, pollo con chorizo and of course chips and salsa. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The decor is lacking and the strip mall location is less than desirable. Again, it will do in a pinch but the bar is set pretty low around here."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and I find the service to be rather friendly and efficient.  The quality of the food is pretty good but nothing too special.  Food quality is relatively authentic and the building is in a great location."}
{"text":"The service is good.  The food is very bland.  Had been eyeing this place for a while to try, but it disappointed. We will keep looking for better food."}
{"text":"This place was not great but not bad either.  The food just lacked a little spice.  It seemed authentic, but bland - though I tend to find Mexican places outside of the southwest take it easy on the seasoning - maybe as to not offend those with more sensitive palates?  Who knows. The prices were good and it seems like they have lots of decent margarita specials so who can complain about that? I just wish the food had more kick to it.  I mean, it was bland. Bland enough I can't see myself becoming a regular, which is too bad, since it's so close by."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, but never to sit down and eat; I just get takeout. Each time I call, the employees are friendly, and my orders have always been accurate. The estimated times they give are accurate as well, so I've never had to wait more than a few minutes to pick up an order. The food itself is good but unimpressive. It's definitely good enough to be my go-to Mexican takeout place in the Mint Hill area, but if I want to go out for Mexican food at a sit-down place, I'll head somewhere else."}
{"text":"Another awesome visit without friends at Taxco. Chicken Quesadilla with a side of rice. Shredded chicken with a scoop of white cheese sauce."}
{"text":"We ate here last week & I was very pleased with how the manager was walking table to table after the people cleaned them to make sure they were all clean. I got the giant burrito with steak that came with beans & rice; so so good. My husband loved his taco salad. The service was awesome. Will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, service is slow but they are very nice, prices are right. Great addition to Mint Hill food!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. Wish my waiter English was better so I would not have to keep repeating myself. I've eaten here twice. Probably won't go back if craving Mexican food. Didn't like the atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"We LOVE Taxco! The best Sopa De Pollo ever and excellent staff! Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Its nice to have some variety in the neighborhood. This is a quality Mexican restaurant. The place is a little divey but the food is really good. I came here for lunch during the work week and it was quiet. Service was good and food came out fast. I ordered the combination with two enchiladas (chicken and beef) and it was very good. A nice place to grab lunch if you work in the area. I'l be back to try some of their specials and take out service."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is standard Mexican faire, but the flavors and combinations elevate above the competition. If you sit at the bar, you'll have the chance to be served by the friendliest bartender in Charlotte. He smiles and greets you like an old friend and is extremely attentive to your needs, anticipating chips and salsa refills and ready to pull the trigger on another Margarita. You can chat with the staff about futbol, it's always on the TV and the crew has a fanatical knowledge.  Taxco is great for a date night, a laid back night out or just a couple of Margitas after work on a Thursday."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite Mexican Food place for 12 years running. Also great for business, individual dining. It's hot, fast, tasty, and economical. The service is unmatched by any restaurant below the finest dining out there. These folks take what they do very seriously and do it well. And the best part is that we've seldom had to wait for a table outside of Cinco De Mayo. Best kept secret!  And for those of you trying or needing to avoid gluten or dairy, these folks are very accommodating and seldom mess up an order.  And that's coming from someone who goes there at least once a month and always has a very custom order. I'm amazed at how fast and accurate these guys are."}
{"text":"When it comes to Mexican this place is phenomenal. Probably some of the best service I've ever had. I'll come a few times a month just because of it. Great lunch specials from 11-3:30"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today as it was convenient to my new job. Can't complain about the service because it was fast, but the food left much to be desired. I ordered a chimichanga from the lunch menu which came with beans and a salad. The beans (refried) were fine, but the chimi was a disaster. It was supposedly fried, but you'd never know it. The ground beef was quite bland, and the whole thing was covered with a tomato sauce that can only be described as similar to that found in Chef Boyardee's canned ravioli. I cannot accurately describe how strange it was to have what tasted like an Italian sauce covering a Mexican dish...not like the typical enchilada red sauce. The salad was lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream which I just put on top of the chimi rather than eat like a salad. Again, that seemed weird. Chips and salsa were good. Based on this visit, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been by this place a thousand times and decided that I would stop by yesterday, I thought it was going to be great.  Well I was soo wrong it sucked really bad the best thing I had was the chips they give you.  I ordered fajitas and you should never be able to go wrong with fajitas but these were really bad, mine had no flavor in any kind of way I believe they cut up a whole onion and put it in my box it was just really unpleasant.  Will not be going back, however the waitress was really nice."}
{"text":"Prices were good and the good food was good. Quick service around lunch time and the bartender at the bar was very friendly. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Okay fellow Yelpers, this place is totally mediocre. I have a hard time believing that this place is anyone's favorite Mexican restaurant. Average or below average sums up the entire experience. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and normally, I assume that it will be a deep fried burrito with lots of queso on top along with sour cream and tomatoes. It was nothing like that. It was a chicken burrito, not fried at all and instead of queso, it was covered in tomato sauce similar to tomato soup. No sour cream or tomatoes, just orange tomato sauce. Weird. It didn't really taste bad at all but it was not what I'd consider a normal chimichanga by any means. The chips were meh, atmosphere not great, just a Mexican restaurant that quit trying to be good years ago. Sorry, I cannot recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Details...they matter to me. I travel for work and stopped here because it was close to my hotel. Had the Regular Grilled Chicken Tacos and they were great. Details... like ripe avacado's, corn tortillas and chicken that was properly cooked. Details...like seeing the bartender wipe down menus. It makes a difference. I enjoyed my meal. Great quality for the price."}
{"text":"Taxco is the latest incarnation of restaurant in this space, but that may not mean it is the best. It isn't bad, by any means - in fact, the service is actually quite good. The food, however, is a bit lacking. Even the fajitas do not feel like they want to come to the party, as the cast iron skillet doesn't want to sizzle. You can put your hand on directly on there without any protection (not suggested in all circumstances).  It is hard to put my finger on the exact problem - everything tasted okay, it just had no pop to it - almost like the cook(s) forgot to add seasoning to everything. About the only thing that had any flavor the night we tried was the salsa that came with the chips - and it was not so hot that it killed off everything else, so I don't think that was it.  Since they just opened, maybe they haven't received their seasonings yet."}
{"text":"Chris and his crew rock!  We love this place and it's not pricey at all."}
{"text":"Taxco is amazing. You wouldn't know it from looking at the shopping center it is in with an Aldi, Fred's, and Dollar Tree, but the food is great. The servers are very polite and keep your drinks filled. Speaking of drinks, the specials are amazing. You have to come in for their draft specials. Although they don't have much on draft, they have some great Mexican beers. If you want Mexican in Belmont, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up tacos and chicken quesadillas but this place always finds a way. I really want to find something to like here because it only 5 minutes away. We have been here several times and it's always bad."}
{"text":"I love taxco, this one and the huntersville location. Great quesadillas, beans, and chips, salsa and queso."}
{"text":"That food sucked. No flavor or quality, a homeless person would have thrown it away. Their all about the quantity I'll give them that but the quality is poor. They had 1 type of cheese and it definitely wasn't mexican. It tasted like cheese from a spare bottle. Somehow the chicken tasted like the cheese."}
{"text":"1. One star for a good margarita.  2. But the margaritas still aren't good enough for me to ever come back again.  Worst Mexican food ever. Beans are just brown soup- I don't know what the origin of this is .Ground beef like taco bell meat.  Service - no."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff that always make you feel welcome.  Great food and very reasonable prices. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The mister and I recently ordered carry-out from here for the first time to curb our craving for Americanized Mexican food and to appease our apathy for making dinner. The person who took my order was friendly, but I was a bit thrown off when he said it would only take ten minutes, that he kept repeatedly calling me lady, and that he did not ask for a name with my order. It was all good though because the order was exact.   My mister had the steak burrito and I had the fajita fundidas (isn't that fun to say?) and a half-order of guacamole. We were pleasantly surprised with random bonus salads and that chips and salsa were included with our carry-out. I agree with the other reviews though that the food is slightly bland. Despite that though, our meals were generally good, and the amount of food for the low price was great."}
{"text":"Worse experience ever. Food was cold. Service was even worse. If you want to be treated badly and possibly get sick. Try this place"}
{"text":"I ordered the two tacos and the chalupa. I was very unpleasantly surprised to see the chalupa was just a round shell with lettuce, guac, beans, and a slice of tomato. I asked the waiter if my order was right and he said yes. That's how a chalupa looks. So i shrugged and tasted it. It tasted pretty bland, as well as the two tacos. Also, this meal didn't come with rice or beans. Maybe i just made a bad choice but either way i won't be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The vegetarian burrito is amazing! It is basically a fajita burrito with queso blanco poured on top. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Your pretty typical Mexican restaurant. Everything tastes good and service was decent. Food tastes just like every other Mexican restaurant you've ever been to. Prices are good too so that helps."}
{"text":"Always friendly. Order always comes out in a timely manner. Great drinks and my kids love their chicken nuggets!!"}
{"text":"This place is sad. Service was horrible, and the food was about the same. It was absolutely tasteless, even the salsa had to have salt added to it. My enchiladas came out wrong. I asked them to give me the enchiladas that I had ordered and they sent them out with uncooked corn tortillas. Basically they never put it in the oven they just covered it with red sauce. Don't waste your time or your money. This makes me want to open up a Mexican restaurant right next-door. Disgrace to Mexican food unfortunately."}
{"text":"Attempted to order takeout today. Seeing as it's Cinco de Mayo, a long wait time was expected and wasn't a problem. What was a problem was being ignored by the manager and other staff members when trying to fight through the crowd to just be acknowledged when arriving at the time they said the order would be ready (35 minutes after ordered). When finally acknowledged, was treated extremely rudely and informed to \"stand in line\". Another patron waiting for takeout then replied that he'd been there for over an hour. Again, the wait wasn't really the true issue, the rudeness of the staff was. When we informed them that we would cancel the order, the response was just \"okay\". No attempt at all to rectify the situation. Perhaps if they valued the customer a bit more, their reviews would reflect that. Stay away."}
{"text":"My family and I are on our way to Florida from NY for vacation. We stopped for the night and happened across this delightful Mexican restaurant. The food was delicious and fast. The service was friendly and very attentive. If we are ever in the area again I would definitely stop back and eat."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions, good price. Standard Mexican fare, this is a place you go when you are hungry but not spendy. Friendly service, clean restaurant. Nothing fancy, just good."}
{"text":"Always have had a great experience at this restaurant. The staff has been fun and great. The food is okay but the drink specials are awesome. A pitcher of good beer for around nine dollars. =) Recommend for those looking for this and decent Mexican style food."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this Mexican place in Mint Hill.  I really wanted to love it because good go-to authentic Mexican restaurants are becoming more and more difficult to find around here.    Everything was exactly what the 3 stars represent on yelp...\"A-OK.\"  Nothing was amazing, nothing was puke-worthy.  It was just OK.  I am not desperate to return and no new cravings developed from my visit.  I tried the shrimp fajitas and hubby ordered his usual beef tacos.    My meal came with a salad before the entrée and it was basically just chopped up iceburg lettuce.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  I guess in theory it was a nice \"addition\" but they can keep their bag of lettuce...seriously. The fajitas were okay.  The black beans were dry and bland and I ordered a side of guacamole that tasted like water.  It was gross.    Everything else was just ok, as mentioned.  The salsa was okay, the service was decent and the food was basic/decent.  If in the area, it isn't a bad option for a quick bite of Mexican food."}
{"text":"After watching the last restaurant in this space (The Palmetto Grill) struggle for a while, and never really recover, I have vowed never to review a newly opened restaurant again.    Now that we have been here 4 or 5 times, I am happy to say that every time they get better.  Yes, the food was *yawn* in the beginning and the service was a bit...scattered, but they have come along nicely.  We still like Azteca's food much better, but for walking distance in Mint Hill, it's not bad.  The margaritas are excellent (which is another reason to walk), reasonably priced and frequently on special..in fact....they have drink specials most nights.The guacamole is fresh, but pretty boring.  (Perhaps once you have Azteca's guacamole made before your eyes at your table, you are ruined for life?).   You can order \"half orders\" of a lot of their appetizers, (the hot queso is excellent) which is a nice touch.  My favorite entree so far is the enchiladas with the mole sauce. Three Enchiladas, your choice....chicken, beef or cheese, topped with mole sauce and melted cheese. Served with rice and beans.  The rice is good..the beans...meh.  The partner likes the Chile Verde, big tender pieces of pork in what I understand to be some really good verde sauce. Service has gotten much better (much more friendly and efficient), chips are warm and fresh, salsa is ok.  HINT:  If you like spicy (as we do) ask your server for the \"Hot Salsa\" they keep hiding in the back (my guess is habanero), mix it with the house salsa and you are good to go!    If you are looking for something in the area, want to have a drink or two...maybe pick up a little Mexican... (food!) ...you won't be disappointed with Taxco."}
{"text":"I got the chicken fajitas which tasted very good but it only came with 3 very small shells.  I asked the server for more and got them a few minutes later. After I got my bill I saw that Inwas charged additional $ for them.  They need to provide enough shells for the dish that you order and are already paying for.  At the very least, make the customer aware that it will cost extra."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and we were all pleasantly surprised! We had an event at Waterbean Coffee next door, and we all wanted to go out for dinner. After debate, we decided our party of 5 would try out Taxco.  The house salsa and chips were great- not too spicy of a salsa and not too salty of chips. The strawberry margarita was delicious!   We had a variety of meals going on, but there was some ACP, fajitas, tacos, etc and everyone was happy and all the plates were empty by the end of the night.   Good prices and pretty good service too!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic food. The service was very fast and friendly, the manager made great recommendations and checked on our table throughout our visit. Prices were very low for the amount of food we received!"}
{"text":"First time visit & was very pleasantly surprised.  It's got a good, clean feel to it and the staff was excellent, friendly and helpful.    Salsa was very runny (which I typically like more than chunky), but had a fantastic flavor and enough heat.  Chips are on the thick side, but good.  Queso was also on the thicker side and good, but not great.  The queso was honestly the worst thing we had if that tells you something.  On to the entrees.  My girlfriend had the \"Naked Burrito\" which was basically an open faced burrito.  Large flour tortilla with chicken (or beef), onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, black beans, rice, sour cream, hot sauce, guacamole and Pico de Gallo.  Easily enough for most people to have two meals.  The chicken was PERFECTLY cooked too and just as delicious.  I had been considering it too and almost wished I had gotten it, but was equally impressed with my own entree, \"Carne al Albanil\".  It was basically two large, very thinly sliced pieces of steak COOKED in salsa verde.  Holy cow it was good.  It also came with rice and beans, a salad and tortillas.  The salsa/beef had an amazing flavor and an unexpected, but welcomed bite that I wasn't use to from most salsa verde.  The beef of course was tough, but I also didn't expect it to be filet for $11.  My portion was also easily two meals and had I not avoided the rice all together, it would have been.    My girlfriend also got a strawberry frozen margarita which, as with everything else, was quite delicious.    I'd give this place a 4.5 if I could.  A 5 for me has to be a place that's incredibly memorable and whereas this place has that potential after trying a few other dishes, I think it was simply the perfect place for us tonight and can think of another couple Mexican places I'd prefer more, although they certainly aren't as local as this one.  A new favorite perhaps for us when we eat Mexican locally."}
{"text":"What has happened to your food? We were so disappointed. I ordered the chicken mole pablano. . Mole Pablano in general is one of my favorite dishes but your had no taste and was so watered down..  As I tried the salsa , it was so darn hot I asked the waitress if they had a milder salsa or taco sauce whatever I said. I like some heat but this was way too hot. She said we had a child's salsa. Well that wasn't necessary to tell us, I thought, , just bring us a milder sauce.  Never came. The son ordered your fajiatas.  When ordering the dinner the waitress asked if he wanted sour cream and salsa. Usually when asked that, it is for the main course/. Ahead of main dish she brought I guess what was a salad?? with lettuce and sour cream and salsa on it. Weird. His dish seemed like the onions were cooked somewhat, peppers thrown in and this no taste, tough meat.   There was not a hint of even salt and pepper. The dinner came out so fast you knew it was just slapped together. I reminded the waitress about the salsa and she brings this little dish with hot taco sauce. Now granted I may have said Taco sauce but when originally I asked for it, it was clear I wanted milder salsa.  Finally the refried beans were so watered down that I felt like I was eating baby food. Only good thing was my son was able to use it for the fajiatas to give it some flavor.  Best thing still at your place are the Margaritas.  I had just taught a cooking class that day was looking forward to one of those. Please look at how your cooks are making things.  Robert Irvine would have thrown most of it out."}
{"text":"Service was fine....food was not. Ordered the shredded chicken from the lunch menu, it came with rice and beans and tortillas. The chicken was tasteless, I had to add salt to even make it edible. The beans were a pureed slop on the plate and the rice tasted like they came out of a box mix. Definitely won't recommend or be back."}
{"text":"This place has OK food but nothing to write home about.  I went here for lunch with my husband and the service was extremely fast, which was much appreciated since we both had to get back to work after.  I ordered steak tacos with a side of black beans and rice.  The tacos weren't particularly flavorful nor were the the beans and rice.  To be perfectly honest there are more flavors and textures in some of the frozen meals I buy.  All of that being said, I am willing to give them another shot, I'm just not dying to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great neighborhood feel! The bartender, Oscar, always makes us feel welcome and at home.  Best margaritas and chicken chillequilles in Charlotte! Perfect place to unwind after work :)"}
{"text":"horrible.  I ordered a veggie delight burrito, supposed to have squash, zucchini. mushrooms  and bell pepper.  no mention of onion, what I got was basically a caramelized onion burrito. No zucchini.  no squash and about 4 tiny slices of mushroom.  I ordered the same drink as my friend and her glass was much bigger and fuller, we both paid the same price."}
