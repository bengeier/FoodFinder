{"text":"Don't order piggy club sandwich it's very bad only ham, bacon, luncheon cost &6.99 No drink! Service Bad !! Portion very very small! Tea time pastes like kids meal! OMG"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend, and was surprised that I have never ventured into this gem, having lived in Richmond Hill all my life. It's a local Hong Kong Style Cafe, except it's fancier, and dishes that come out actually looking like the chef spent more than 2 seconds on. But presentation obviously comes second to the most important trait...taste. No worries, they win on this front too.  Like all the other reviews mention, this place is known for their Hainanese Chicken Rice, and I do say it's a must order! The chicken is unbelievably moist and smooth, The rice is flavoured with some kind of garlic bits, which made it delicious to eat even on its own.   Most meals come with complimentary beverages, and I went with my go-to Horlicks beverage. No complaints.  One thing I will mention though, is how small this cafe is. I'm going to say they have about 30 seats, when realistically they probably should have stopped at 20."}
{"text":"I was a regular here as we live quite close and the price/value/quality combination was quite good. Well, it seems something has really changed. First, the menu is long and the prices are higher than before. Second, the quantity you get is simply abysmal. I ordered the banana left wrapped fried rice with pork and we had 3 other items around the table. What I got was about 2 lbs of white tasteless rice and 5 pieces of tiny pork shreds that were mostly fat. There was almost nothing else. Everyone around the table agreed this was our last time here. It's really too bad. We used to like this place as a dependable standby for continental food.    I am giving it 2 stars as lunch seems to be a better deal and the rib noodles were ok. So 1 out of the last 6 dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"It's a small cozy cafe.  The food is amazing!  Smaller portion but the quality is extraordinary.  The red wine ox-tail stew is delicious.  Definitely a MUST-TRY! ;)"}
{"text":"We had it to go to avoid the lunch crowds and limited parking in the lot (busy plaza during weekend lunchtime).     We ordered from their lunch menu.   Entree includes a drink, no soup (unlike other Hong Kong style cafes  of this category which usually includes both).  Pricier than others too.  Meals were tasty but was it worth the priciness?   Worth trying but the price point is a bit steep for regular / frequent consumption.    We ordered: -Hainanese chicken (sauces were good, but chicken was somewhat fatty for my liking). -Baked fish with dill rose sauce on spaghetti (once again the sauce was good but the fish was battered and tasted rubbery)  -oxtail on rice looked and tasted great"}
{"text":"Food - restaurant has its own style on a lot of popular dishes.  This style seems to not work for all people but hits the spot for me.  My go to dishes is the curry beef or chicken.  Curry is heavy on the pepper which makes it pepper spicy and not chili spicy if that makes sense.  Second is the hainaese chicken, its not what you normally get at a 'typical' Chinese restaurant so it can throw you off but i've learned to love it.  Mussels, pork hock are also among my favourites!!  Service - friendly staff  Environment - classic rock music style restaurant with class.  Bit small but manageable.  Price - slightly above your typical Chinese restaurant but worth it as the chef is a trained chef (george brown from the pictures)."}
{"text":"Been there several times for lunch. Tried different food and they were all bland, even the famous indo fried rice was bland with a very strange tasting spice added to the rice. Although their service was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Must Try: Indo Fried Rice Ox Tail  Overall, the food quality is not bad.  The tables are kind of close to each other.  Price is alright.."}
{"text":"Came in asked the waiter how long is the wait. He said 20. Told me there is two tables and then us. There was a bit of a line. Saw a couple of table paying. After 45min, we are still waiting. Then all of the sudden a big group came marching in and took the two tables. The I asked why. The waiter said they booked, which he didn't tell us. The owner or manger came talk to us and said \"they booked a table, you could book too\". WTF! Then I took off and never came try. Now(a few months later) I see they have no more line and not busy at all."}
{"text":"Fav Cafe becomes my favourite cafe, my \"canteen\"!  The staff is very friendly and professional.  They really know about the food and can introduce you with what you want!  And they have passion!  I have tried their AAA Dry Aged Striploin for 2.  It's really delicious.  They can really cook the striploin with the correct degree of cooking.  Normally, it is always not the degree I want in other restaurant coz they always put the steak or striploin under the salamanda and the steak cooked further....  I love their breakfast!  With just $3.5 I can have two eggs, choices of breakfast sausage or bacon, toast, baked tomato and beans. You hardly find baked tomato in other Chinese cafe.  Their toast is really good!  Just like the toast from Golden Pheonix in the past.  I have not got a chance to try the prawn toast from afternoon tea set menu.  Must try this later.  Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"I had Curry Beef Flank over rice from its \"classic\" lunch menu. Portion is reasonable but not generous on the beef. For its price, which is on the pricy side for Chinese food, you can get more beef flank from somewhere else which is as good. The flavor is pretty good but the potatoes in the curry is bland and had a weird texture. The curry is creamy and has a good balance of spiciness. The steam rice's texture is too tough. Not moist enough. At the end I felt unsatisfied mostly due to the lack of meat. Incidentally this dish is marked as their \"signature\" dish on the menu.  Service was slow. I was waved to sit down at a small table by the door. After getting seated, I didn't get a menu for 5 mins, which is quite atypical for a Hongkongese restaurant."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on two separate occasions. Both occasion my friends and I had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table. This \"cafe\" is tiny. Chinese run. Hong Kong style (or fusion western food inspired).  On April 28th 2013 I had this crispy pork on ciabatta bun $5.50 (i don't remember exactly the name but its under the sandwich area on the lunch menu). My sandwich came with a side and i chose potato salad. When my meal arrived, the sandwich was the size of my fist and a scoop of potato salad of my fist as well. It was nicely plated very westernize. Small portion but boy the taste of the pork sandwich was amazing! You fight over quality vs quantity. I must admit it was not filling. But i really enjoyed the marinara sauce inside my pork sandwich it really complimented each other since the pork was crispy. The Ciabatta bread was nice and fresh. I love good bread. The potato salad differ from the usual that I receive at Hong Kong Style cafes. Fav Cafe's potato salad had potato skins, herbs and other vegetables. I enjoyed the potato salad as well. I didn't expect this from a Chinese place.  On May 4th 2013 I had crispy pork on rice with tomato soup $7.50 (i don't remember exactly the name of what i had again. yet its under the lunch meal menu. can be easily found). This had a meal drink, so i order a cold cup of lemon ice tea (cold drinks add an extra $1.00). The representation of food is amazing! The Crispy Pork cutlet was chopped into strips on a mountain medium bowl shape of rice surrounded by a pool of red tomato soup. Delicious! Crispy pork and tomato soup is a good match! The portions was good for me. I pretty much clean the entire plate and was really full.  Enjoy my cold lemon ice tea since it was a hot day. Please mind that if you want to doggy bag your meal, it cost an extra 70 cents for the plastic container. Not sure if they charge you extra if you order to take it to go.  The cafe is tiny yet clean and bright. Tables are separated and pulled together all the time to accommodate various sizes of table parties. But a table larger then 6 people will find it hard to be seated. (Must wait for tables either sides to leave to combine tables together.) There is not much space between tables. This is not a good place for babies, baby strollers and wheel chairs. If you are in a rush, you'll be late if you wait here for a table. Better luck order it to go or go elsewhere. They have a tiny tall Coca Cola fridge fill with pop in glass bottles. Music is mostly jazzy feel and casual trendy atmosphere. They had some framed band/movie posters on the wall and the waiters are young up beat individuals. Friendly and prompt on service. There's only one washroom for all genders. Its dirty. and the door opens to the back kitchen area close to the dirty dishes. the waiting area is about 3 feet by 2 feet. I cannot imagine waiting for a seat here in the winter.   i would come here again and again. I have had good experience so far. And would like to try other foods offered here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not worth going to.  Sausage Platter $7.50 = 2 tiny thin sausages with 20 fries.  Can't believe that they have the nerve to serve this."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea after reading some Yelp reviews. The place is clean and service courteous. That's a great start!  We ordered : -pickled veg and pork with vermicelli in soup Broth is clear and clean. Not too much oil. This one is pretty good. - deep fried chicken wings with fries 3 full wings with tip,wing and drum attached. Wings tasted good as they added seasoning to the batter - French style French toast.  I like this one! This is how REAL French toast is supposed to be. A much healthier option. It's not deep fried. Its soaked in egg batter, then pan fried with a dusting of icing sugar. I can also taste a hint of citrus zest in the batter. Comes with maple syrup on the side.  All three dish were about $5-6 includes tea/ coffee.  They do charge 50 cents for a plastic takeout box.  This place is pretty refreshing from the usual HK greasy dives in the area. I checked out their lunch menu and interested in trying a few dishes. Though lunch prices are a tad pricier than other places. About $10-16. But if they offer quality food and care in their cooking then I  would be willing to pay a bit more."}
{"text":"Were there eating lunch, and the food is not bad and the hk style tea is quite good! I tried the bitter melon fried rice with egg, quite good.. Not oily and smell nice.  Will come again ...."}
{"text":"The Indonesian fried rice is so yummy. Definitely will go back again. Their aged steak is only available if pre ordered.."}
{"text":"This is a small HK style cafe. I think it opened couple years ago. The decor is not bad, and they provided a daily fine specials on the wall which is around $20 for each dish. We came here couple weeks ago for lunch but this place was packed, and customers were all standing at the doors, so we went to the next door HK style cafe instead. This time we went for dinner on a weekdays, and the place was quite empty.  We did not try out their fine specials on the wall because we would like to try their normal items on their menu first. The main dish came with soup and a drink. We ordered hot milk tea but it came at the very end after we finished our meal."}
{"text":"Every time there's a craving for curry, Fav cafe is one of my go-to as they make excellent curry chicken and curry brisket. I usually order the chicken though because it's a healthier meat choice between the two.   The curry sauce is made to perfection every time. It's not super spicy that it isn't enjoyable but spicy enough to get my sniffles going. I like how they give a generous amount of sauce so that I can sauce up my rice if I wanted to. The curry chicken meal comes with a choice of drink and I ordered the iced lemon tea. Complimentary soup is given only during dinner.   Staffs were friendly and attentive.  Fav is a modern Hong Kong cafe. So if you're in the area looking for this style of food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Quite overpriced. I got a Fish Fillet baked in Dill Rosé Sauce, nothing special. They seem understaffed. No water was ever given to us, and our drinks arrived basically at the end of our meal. We even had to ask for our drinks and the woman told us she has no time.  When our dishes were being served to us, the male server asked whose it was. We gesture to him \"thats mine\" and usually people would place the dish infront of you. Nope, he just continues to place it on the side of the table. He did that for every single dish. Not a big deal but why bother asking if you had no intention of giving it to the person.  Food is mediocre, overpriced, meh service.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Randomly picked this restaurant since I am hungry and just want to grab something to eat quickly.  Cream of Broccoli (score 5/5) It's creamy and has the taste of broccoli. The taste is just right, not too salty and not too watery. Just perfect!   Baked Pork Chop with Spaghetti  in Tomato  Sauce (score 4/5) It came out HOT!! The Spaghetti is just right, not too soft or not too hard. Pork chops are cut into small pieces which are easier to eat. The taste is good, the sauce is not too sour. I believe a pinch of sugar is added to the sauce. It does taste slightly sweet but it's not too bad. The only issue I have is I don't like the cheese  on top of the sauce. Honestly, the melted cheese does make the appearance look of dish looks better, just that my personal preference does not like cheese  a lot.    The waitresses are a bit too chatty. They having been chatting with each other loud and repeatedly."}
{"text":"Small HK Style diner in Richmond Hill.  I only been here for the Afternoon tea set and it was very disappointing as the portion are tiny and menu is lacking. I think I will need to come back for their lunch or dinner menu.  Staff here was friendly and prompt on service. Decor is nice as they try to make it trendy with movie, music band posters."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. Maybe it's because it was a weeknight, but the food was mediocre at best and service was lacking.  All dinner sets come with the soup of the day and a drink. We got the cream of mushroom that evening - not too bad but tasted a little watered down.  The Hainan chicken with rice was dry and I got the feeling that it wasn't prepared fresh. The only thing I liked was the selection of sauces it came with, but this is hard to mess up. The fried beef noodle was okay but very oily. The pork chop in onion sauce with rice was average.  It wasn't until the rest of us had almost finished our dishes that my dad's fried rice was finally served. We had followed up on it once but got a rude response. We are very patient people but the service was just not good at all. Doesn't help that the food wasn't good either. Needless to say I won't be back - there are much better options in the area!"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner since a friend of mine highly recomends this place.  There's some soothing music playing on the background.  The ambience is quite good.  The customer service was good.  I was greeted immediately once I was in the restaurant.  The food I find came too quickly for the price I am paying.  I thought I could finish my appetizer first, but my main course ox tail braised with red wine with rice was served after less than 3 mins.  I didn't even finish my soup. Lol!  Luckily, my dish was still quite warm as i tried to finish my soup quickly.  The ox tail was delicious.  The presentation was not so good though.  I don't really like the look of rice sitting on top of so much sauce.  I guess I am really picky.  The table was not levelled properly so as I was cutting into the ox tail, a quarter of my milk tea spilled on the table.  All in all, it was good.  I properly would order something cheaper there since it feels more like a HK styles tea restaurant than a cafe."}
{"text":"This cafe is slightly different from your typical hong Kong style Cafe. It has more of a western flare and fusion to their dishes.   I've gone for brunch a handful of times and I would say it's alright. My go to is usually a noodle soup (braised beef brisket) for lunch.   I will likely come try their afternoon tea menu or early breakfast menu one day! However, I don't think it's super special.   Ps. I'm a lover of hk milk tea and I would say it's one of the best parts of the meal."}
{"text":"Unhygienic, I vomited and diarrhea after eating their food. Yuck! Barf! Gross!"}
{"text":"One of the better cafe's in the area, with good quality food. Depending on the day and time you go, it can be very busy. With minimal parking and limited tables, you would have to get lucky for a parking spot, and probably call ahead to make a reservation.   Not really a Hong Kong style cafe, but maybe a mix of cultures. Nice food options from around the world on one menu, and makes choices quite interested. Got the Curry Braised Beef, my mom got an Indonesian Style Chicken on Rice, and my brother got the Tiger Prawn Pasta. The curry was quite good, with enough flavour and spice without overdoing it. The rice looked amazing, beautifully plated and delicious! My brother said the pasta was amazing too, as their prawn were very fresh! Most meals also come with a beverage, which is awesome. Their Milk Tea is very good here, so definitely worth a try!  Service is pretty good, with quick and efficient servers, and food coming out pretty quickly. The servers are also friendly, but probably don't realize that their tone sometimes comes across as a bit rude or apathetic. Something to think about I guess...  Definitely a good spot to try some different dishes for a decent price. Despite the parking struggles, you will want to try this spot out!"}
{"text":"Second time ordering lunch here. I ordered a $9.95 beef noodle in lunch menu(not afternoon tea). What I get is 5 pieces radish and a few rice noodle. I can hardly find a singe beef in my bowl. I don't think it is worth 10 dollars. Worst lunch experience in Richmond hill so far! Most of the restaurants in RH wouldn't do such thing. I don't know it's owners fault or cooks. But I would definitely tell everyone I know DONT step in here."}
{"text":"My Fish Fillet Baked in Dill Rosé Sauce with Rice arrived first.  In addition to the dill rosé sauce, there was definitely cheese baked on top of it too.  It smelled really great.  I found the combination of dill rosé sauce with the cheese to be so delicious!  No wonder Baron recommended this dish.  It was definitely tasty.  The rice grains were smaller than I was used to.  I thought that there could have been more fish fillets within the dish however."}
{"text":"Dinner service  tomato soup on the house with most meals coming with coffee and tea. And because fav cafe is a chinese fusion restaurant there are many varieties of teas and coffees available. (milk tea, almond milk tea, coffee with tea, etc)   The meal itself was good. Taste and portion were both good. The price for dinner meal range from 7~12. With daily specials that can cost up to 59.95.  Service is friendly.  Overall, I would visit again."}
{"text":"Quite a quaint little place. I've had the pleasure of coming here once and been trying to get back just for their nasi Goreng...authentic or not, it is by far the best I've had. Packed for of flavor, the grill chicken was well cooked and juicy, the rice glimmered in a glorious oily sheen. Though pricey, the meal came with the famous HK staple - HK milk tea. It was quite decent and strong.   I wasn't overly impressed with the fish fillet baked in dill sauce as it was a bit underwhelming, especially in comparison to the Nasi goreng. The flavor was quite muted and bland. The fish, though fried, lost its crispy texture completely. The sauce and rice was also quite one dimensional. Not terrible, just not my preference.  I would travel from far just for their nasi goreng! They have a couple of interesting offerings on their menu that is atypical of a HK café as well. It is a bit on the pricey side, especially in comparison with the completion in the area but worth the try."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. Though the location is quite small it has a more upscale feeling than most hk style restaurants. I usually come for dinner as the soup and baked pork chop rice is really good.   This was my first visit for afternoon tea (2:30-5:00pm) and I had the grilled cheese with fries ($5.50) with a drink included. The portion was quite large and they gave a generous amount of cheese in the sandwich. My girlfriend had the satay noodle bowl which we though was a little heavy on the satay.   Overall I would definitely come again for afternoon tea though they did not have a large selection to choose from.  They also sometimes have special \"off menu\" items that are posted on their chalkboard; though a bit more pricey."}
{"text":"So I came here for a quick meal before hitting the movies about a week ago. The venue is clean, and it has a Hollywood theme as decor. The wait staff is typical for an Asian place, so don't expect too much in terms of service. Don't get me wrong, they are polite and all but they don't give you the wow factor as service staff.  Onto the food, it's a typical HK style cafe. But they do blend in some Western elements. Example, I had the Portugese sauce with chicken baked rice casserole from their menu. What they added was Chorizo sausages. It's a nice addition, but somehow I didn't find the additional flavour to be a wow factor. Kind of ruined the taste of the sauce and chicken. My friend ordered a Hoi-nam chicken and rice, and the size leans on the abundance. She couldn't finish her chicken. The flavour was okay for her dish, not over powering."}
{"text":"Quick service. Was brought tea and soup right away. Good pasta, good seafood. Moderate prices, ill be coming back. This is like my FAV cafe."}
{"text":"The food here tastes pretty bad, they are nicely plated and from the photos you see, it will look like it's delicious! however it does not taste like what it looks.  I went for lunch, except it was not early enough for the breakfast obviously and it was not late enough for afternoon tea. there was no lunch special (like pepper wok beside it) so had to order off the main menu (dinner) for lunch.  the selection is little, the menu is small, drink choices are minimal also.  The Nasi Goreng with Chicken steak - the chicken steak was nicely flavored however not enough of that soy sauce on top. and the rice was dried and it was a nice color but lacked flavour. $8.95  the hainan chicken rice was a bit small and most overpriced out of all the places I've had it. $8.95  The japanese style beef rice was not what I had imagine, i would not even call this a curry, it was minced beef and rice with an egg on top, not worth the price and did not taste good. $7.95  the bolognese spaghetti was large, however it had a weird taste, very sweet. there was enough meat toppings, just the flavour was very off. I did not like it at all. $7.95  It still gets 2 stars not because of the food, (cause we did not enjoy it) and we were starving (usually food tastes better when you are extra hungry? it did not) the service was quick, food came quick and I like supporting individual owned businesses, we sat at the back at a high table and there was photos of the owners and their dog, it was cute, and very personal yet welcoming."}
{"text":"I second the review by Bebe B., photos look great but food is mediocre.  Also service by the guy working there is pretty horrible and rude. When we first arrived with an infant care seat, there were 2 tables available but he gestured us to sit at the high chair tables which definitely not ideal and dangerous for a car seat. When we asked if we could we sit at the table furthest from the door (it was cold) he nonchalantly gestured us to sit at the table closer to the door. We were close to leaving right there and then but decided to give it a shot.  I got the Indonesian chicken which looked great in the pictures but the fried/baked chicken was 'OK' and the rice had too much dried shrimp so it tasted off. Baked spaghetti was dry and too much rosemary or some kind of spice.  Only reason I'm giving it a 2 star compared to 1 star is the women server we got was polite and accommodated us to a new table away from the door.  Never coming back for sure, much smaller and narrower than many other better options for HK Cafe, rude service, and dated decor."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's like Chinese-Westernized influenced, which I enjoy. Had their house favourite, haiwanese chicken, which was fresh and came with a rice cooked with chicken oil/broth. Also loved the three sauces that came to dip with it. Their Mac and cheese and pork cutlets are tasty as well. All meals are served with complementary hk milk tea/honey lemon tea and the soup of the day."}
{"text":"I go there for their coffee, its super good , has the same taste as Cafe de Coral in HK ."}
{"text":"Nice decor, nice menu. My understanding is that they are called \"fav\" because all of their dishes on the menu are quick, warm, Asian dishes that tend to be more popular among Chinese people, such as Hai nan Chicken rice, baked pork chop in tomato sauce, fish filet with cream sauce, braised pork belly with mustard veg, etc. We had the Nasi Goreng with chicken steak and the braised pork belly and enjoyed it. They also serve lattes for those who want to enjoy afternoon tea"}
{"text":"I CANT SAY ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS CAFE.  I went there first time with a friend a few months back, the food was really mediocre. It wasnt disgusting and it didnt taste bad, but it wasnt memorable.  Today, I went back there again for a quick bite to eat alone.  the waitress there looked so angry and uninviting. No greetings, what so ever. she threw the menu on the table and pointed for me to go there.   I never write bad reviews, but this is just too much.   I  wanted to order something from the lunch menu, and it was 5 min until the lunch menu time was over.  she said i couldnt cause there wasnt enough time.    ODD.   sure, i didnt say much, so i ordered something else, then i asked for a hot HK milk tea.   in an almost yelling voice she said, \"THIS DOENST COME WITH MILK TEA, SO YOU GOTTA PAY U KNOW.\"   like srsly, i know what i ordered and i can pay, there really isnt a reason to yell.  i couldnt finish the food, so i kindly asked for the bill and a container to pack the food.  again she yells \"CONTAINERS ARE 50 CENTS!\"  i have never been to a restaurant where no only do i have to PAY for a container for the food i already PURCHASED, and also get yelled at by a waitress.    NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN"}
{"text":"Great friendly service.  Faster than fast food where I was in and out in no time.  Had the crispy pork rice with tomato sauce and the milk tea.  The pork stayed crispy.  The milk tea was smooth.  I'll be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice small Hong Kong style cafe with limited seating and interesting menu. I'll review food and space and at the end discuss my experience being there with a large party for any readers interested in that experience.   Food was good. I had the baked fish with dill and rose sauce which was a unique taste. The fish had a soggy feeling to it though because they fried it and then covered it in sauce so I much rather they don't bread the fish. I tried the fried rice dishes off my friends and they tasted pretty good. I'd say this place is over priced a bit though for a Hong Kong cafe... But you do get a bit more unique of a menu. The drinks tasted great as you would expect. I love my Hong Kong ice lemon tea :) milk tea was great too!   The place was clean, but it is small so I think if you have a larger group, definitely call in for reservation.  We booked a week in advance and they were able to accommodate a table for 16 which was very kind of them and we did what we could to be accommodating, quiet and organized so it's easier for the waiters. But one or two were still visually quite displeased with us and impatient with us. Our food arrived promptly as we did not expect them to deliver all dishes at the same time. It's no different than if you were waiting on four tables of four; we just happen to be sitting together. I found it a bit rude considering how much we were trying to make sure it was easy for them to serve our table. To be honest, there were five other tables... It's a restaurant that holds maybe 30 people...So is not exactly slammed in the small space...   One waiter was friendly and the rest were just rude."}
{"text":"I used to come to Kiko Cafe for lunch and afternoon to and when Fav took it's place I wanted to check it out.  First impressions were great. I like the hipster look with the salvaged wood tables and chalk board walls. They now have LLBO so drink up!  We ordered from their lunch and afternoon tea menu.  Their pickled cabbage shredded pork noodle soup was okay. Very little pork and not much else. The soup was on the bland side but I take that as they made the soup from scratch and not from MSG packs which is good.   Their club sandwich was miss. Bacon, lettuce, tomato, spam and ham. Spam and bacon make it way too salty and it just didn't work out well.   The milk tea was passable but you can get better flavoured tea at other places like this one.   I hope things get better. I'll try other dishes that I hear are their specialties another time and update."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars here. The people that run this place are always super friendly. They have a lot of great dishes, but my favourites are the Nasi Goreng with Chicken Steak, Beef Rib Noodle in Soup, Malaysian Chicken & Rice and the Japanese Beef Curry Rice. Your classic HK / Western style cafe, but made with quality ingredients. Would absolutely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Well we gave it a try since we saw our friend try it. It's a nice little restaurant. We usually try the an inexpensive dish. This place can get expensive. The fish we order wasn't anything special. The mushroom lotus on rice is pretty good. I think there menus is unique but the price should be little lower. The table beside me was only a foot away. The service was pretty good. It's worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Tried the Hainan Chicken rice again and was disappointed.   - Rice was very hard and dry, no taste - Chicken had no hainan flavor. Actually, it had no taste overall."}
{"text":"Upgrade rating to 4 stars, if you stick with the main entrees.  We came for dinner recently.  There were more selections for dinners than lunches.  They covered from noodles and rice (mostly $10), to baked rice and pasta ($10 and up), to Western main entrees ($20 and up).  There is something for everyone in a family.    I ordered a Ham Hock ($20).  Though more expensive than a Chinese rice or noodle, the portion of protein was a lot more.  For reference, the rice with pork that my mom ordered had a lot more rice than protein, but my ham hock has a lot more protein than pasta.  Double the price, double the good ingredients.  I call this fair.  As seen in picture, the ham hock was pleasing to the eyes.  The ham tasted good, but the texture could be softer.  The pasta was good.  The services was all right."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop restaurant with some pretty awesome old school posters from Edgefest and other rock bands on tour in the 00s.  Ordered the nasi Goreng and baked pork chop on spaghetti and both came with complimentary lemon/ hk style tea!  If you're looking for a HK style cafe this would be a good one to try - however the menu is quite limited."}
{"text":"Decent little place serving Chinese western style food.  The actual space would seat about 30 or so people, and everyone that entered was asked if they had reservations or not.  We tried the hainese chicken, which looked and tasted pretty decent, as well as curry beef brisket. The curry was quite tasty and peppery, and both portions were quite decent.  It's not the most amazing place, but definitely not the worse. A very solid 3 out of 5"}
{"text":"Genuinely tasty food and great ambiance. There's definitely thought put into the posters that line the wall (my favourite is the Pink Floyd), and the bottled coco cola, possibly for sale. The food's a little more westernized than your average Hong-Kong style cafe, and their cafe creme coffee is yum!  Classic must-tries include their hainan chicken rice (although lately I've heard it's not all that), indonesian chicken fried rice, pork hock, and anything curry.   That being said, big minuses include the hefty price hikes, declining service, and lack of quality control over the years. You are charged extra, at a comparatively hefty value, for little things from takeout boxes to ovaltine. There is one nice waitress and general rudeness eslewhere. For example, in our most recent dinner, we were charged almost $2 extra for substituting other drinks into the free coffee or tea, which was never mentioned in the menu or by our waitress.   Most annoyingly, they don't even offer water when you're seated, a staple at ANY restaurant that involves tipping? More recently, I'd have to ask water every time, and the servers act as though it's an inconvenience. I can't understand why a \"classier\" cafe would skimp on what is otherwise basic service.  Come for weekend brunch, above-average HK cafe food (and above average prices), and surprisingly good background music. Older customers may find, though, that this isn't the \"favourite\" cafe it used to be."}
{"text":"I'm really excited to write this review because I really had a great experience here. At first glace the place is very small and seats about 25-30 max. I don't really like compact restaurants but the place was clean and nicely decorated. The lunch menu was very simple and has limited dishes to choose from when comparing to other HK style cafes. I came with the family so I got to try many different dishes.   My Dad got the curry beef brisket $9.95 - the curry flavours were great, the meat was super tender and soft. Portion of meat was very generous. Comes with rice or spaghetti. Very rarely my dad gives the thumbs up but on this occassion he did so that means it was a 5 star when converting into Yelp stars.  My sister got the crab meat mac n cheese $12.95 - before we got this dish we were already speculating that it would be that fake crab meat that you get at the Chinese super market but we were so proven wrong when we saw actual chunks of crab meat. There was a good amount of cheese, great flavours, crab meat a little on the low side but overall it was another great dish. Usually my sister will give me a portion of her food but this time she didn't want to share so it translates to something near a 5 star in Yelp terms.   My mom got baked seafood spaghetti with cream sauce $11.95 - plenty of seafood, shrimps were very large and overall flavours were good. This one was probably the least impressive dish but still tasted really good to me.  The dish I got was the show stopper. The braised oxtail in red wine sauce for $14.95 - The sauce was amazing, the amount of oxtail they give you is amazing, the super tender fall off the bone meat was amazing. This is one of the few oxtail dishes I have had that even surpasses my moms home made oxtail (sorry mommy).   All meals came with milk tea and even the milk tea was smoother and better than most other places. For what is considered a simple HK style diner, this place is definately a few steps above when it comes to quality of food. The prices are a bit higher but so worth it. Not all dishes were 5 stars but because the oxtail blew me away I will give this place a 5 star review and it is officially my Fav Cafe."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Fav Cafe is a rather small HK style cafe in Jubilee Centre, which until recently I overlooked since nothing in this plaza attracted me very much. It was a random night when I ate at Pepper Wok when I noticed this place packed with customers, hence why I decided to give it a try recently.  The interior of this place has a unique feel. There are lots of vintage posters across the restaurant filled with old school artist concerts such as Bob Marley, disco music, Oasis, Jack Johnson, etc. Too bad they play top 40 music inside the restaurant, cause I feel 70s-90s music would be awesome for a place like this.  Anyway, the menu (at least for dinner) isn't too extensive, but covers the staple HK style specialties quite well. I've been here twice now, and I ordered two items from here: Salmon gravlax penne and crabmeat + bacon mac and cheese.  Both meals I had came with starter soups, and the first time I had what seemed to be a mix of cream soup and borscht...and it was very good! The second time was plain old borscht...which I felt it to be watered down. Guess the starter soup really is dependent on what it is that day.  The crabmeat + bacon mac and cheese...was not macaroni, but more like fussili. In fact, the penne was also fussili. I feel they should've just mentioned pasta in general since there's only one type that's not spaghetti. There wasn't too much cheese in the food, although bacon and crab meat were a little more abundant. Overall it was good, although the price was a little steep.  The salmon gravlax is one of their specialties, and I'm speaking in terms of someone who doesn't like fish...this was very good. The salmon was raw, but had that nice smoked feel to it, similar to aburi sushi style. They definitely performed this dish very well, and this dish is actually worth the just over $10 in price you pay.  Tea is terrible here, so don't expect much from that.  Service was great, definitely above standard for an Asian minded place. Price is a little high here, so it won't be a place that I'll frequent, but will go occasionally."}
{"text":"Small cafe with excellent food. Really pleased, but it was rather challenging to get a parking spot. If we didn't get that spot, we would've left and went to another place. Luckily, we were able to get one because the food was worth it. I believe they have valet parking now? Not sure about the details though."}
{"text":"its your typically HK style cafe with breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea specials nothing really speciall about this place although they try to make the decoration look trendy with green day and other rock and roll posters on the walls....portions are average size and i believe its a lil bit pricy than other places like ocean seafood and richmond hill court, for example cantonese chow mein is $9.95. If you want cold drinks its a dollar more.   Btw dont come on tuesdays because they are closed  I would probably come back here again but if I wear to choose between ocean seafood and here, I would goto oceans"}
{"text":"This review is way overdue. They really do have the best Hainanese Chicken in the city (their Indonesian chicken fried rice is my second favorite). If it weren't for the traffic congestion in the area and the frustration finding a parking spot In the plaza I'd be there more often.   For a HK style Cafe they definitely spend more time on the presentation of their food than any other in the city. Service is also friendlier than other HK cafes too!  Seating is limited, so I usually get there by 11:30 am for lunch, or before 6:00 pm for dinner to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"3.5  Fav Cafe is a Hong Kong style cafe that offers up some dishes normally not served at most other Hk style cafes.  Pros: High end western dishes available Great service  Cons: HK style cafe food could of been better  When you first come in, you notice that this place is rather small.  There are about 8 tables total seating parties of 2, 4, or 6.  The atmosphere is pretty good with music just loud enough to enjoy.  I find some places tend to play music way too loud when they have it, Fav cafe gets it just right.    One look at the menu and the $100 rib steak immediately catches my eye.  Never have I seen such an item that expensive at an HK style cafe.  The menu has completely changed from the menus in the photos for this place on yelp.  There are quite a bit of higher end western dishes on the menu now.  They are much pricier than your everyday HK stlye items.  I take it they are trying to be more of higher class of dining?  If anybody has tried the $100, please message me and tell me how it was.  I ordered the baked seafood on rice with Alfredo sauce and my GF got the baked fish in rose sauce with dill on rice.  My seafood rice was OK though it could of really been better portion wise.  I could count the amount of seafood with my 2 hands.  2 shirimps, 3 pieces of calamari, 3 small fillets of fish and 1 piece of scallop. I could of used a lot more Alfredo sauce as well.  Overall, what I had tasted good, but I was left wanting more after.  My GF's fish was a lot better portion wise and the taste was pretty good too.   Here's the thing I noticed.  The more expensive western dishes were done a whole lot better than the HK style ones. Some of the people there had ordered some of them and they looked very good.  I like the fact they have these options, but as a HK style cafe, you need to make sure you're morn known dishes are done with the same effort.  Just my take.  The service was very good.  Previous reviews had me a little worried but the two servers and someone who looked to be the owner had nothing but great interaction with us.  They were very good with my little one and she opened up to them in no time which only happens if she feels very conformable with strangers.  Overall, a very nice little place.  The HK style could be better but nothing bad enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"I really like Fav Cafe as someone who enjoys HK-style Western food. There are a lot of pasta options to choose from, which is my favourite. The staff are very efficient. Food is pretty decent given the price. I'd come back for a casual meal for sure."}
{"text":"Late review , considering I've had eaten their Nasi Goreng countless times. My buds never seem to grow tired of it . It's Chicken marinated in a sauce with chilli flakes , tasty shrimp paste fried rice (for those who knows and likes bagoong ) this one is really good and fried egg  . For me I take it as my comfort food . I usually do takeouts but the place is cozy. This is unexpected  coming from a busy Chinese plaza . I hope to come back here someday and try their other fares . I say someday becaUse I'm not sure I'll get over their Nasi Goreng anytime soon ."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 sides: Mac n'Cheese with Bacon and Yam Fries. The total came to around $12. Nothing special, but it's still a decent place if you want a quick bite.  There's no A/C.... so don't come on a hot summer day"}
{"text":"Fav Cafe is a New Hong Kong Style Cafe that opened up at the Jubilee Centre.  The staffs here are friendly and decoration welcoming.. and definitely a lot classier than some of the other cafes I frequent.  Afternoon Tea Time, I found the afternoon tea set is a little disappointing with the selections as most of the items are deep fried...  I know some of my friends look that... but some days I just cannot do it.  There are though Noodle Soup Selections ($4.50) ...Wonton, Beef/Fish Balls, Beef Brisket ...  Preserved Mustarded Green With Pork is not bad...the preserved veggie is of good quality and so are the pork which were marinated and cooked before added to my noodle...   I think I will be back to try out their \"Main Course\" which has over 32 different selections starting at $6.95 and includes soup and a drink...  Maybe Fav Cafe can really be my \"Fav\" HK Style Cafe one day!"}
{"text":"Go for a Afternoon Tea~ the price is very affordable like 5~6 dlars you can have a big pork chop with a coffee or milk tea"}
{"text":"I am always up for trying out new Hong Kong Style Café uptown when I want to stay in during the weekend. Have heard some fab things about Fav Café's Hainanes Chicken, so I finally made my way there this past weekend.  The space is rather small and tight but love how their wall are filled with concerts poster... should I say non-Chinese concert poster, posters like Edge Fest and Green Day. The place also look like to be run by young energetic staff, the chefs w/ aprons will sometimes bring out your dishes.  Hong Kong Style Iced Lemon Tea ~ Our meal came with our choice of drinks. ~  I have to say the tea wasn't dark or bitter enough for HK style tea. I\ll have to try their Milk Tea next time.  Hainanese Chicken Rice ???? ~ Have been searching for a place for good Hainanese Chicken Rice in Toronto for ages where both the chicken and rice are as delicious.  ~ The chicken here are perfectly tender and moist while the rice was completely flavorful packed with chicken flavor without being overly oily.  ~ Even the garlic in the garlic chili sauce was filled with fresh chopped garlic while most other places just serve water down store bought version.  ~ The soy sauce was cooked and reduce with sugar which result in a thick sweet yummy goodness.  ~ The minced ginger oil was perfectly seasoned and used young ginger.  Lotus Leaf wrapped Pork Neck & Salty Fish Fried Rice ??? ~ Love how the rice itself didn't have too much of the salty fish or salt itself so that you can actually taste the lotus leaf flavor.  ~ Love how it's served pipping hot which is perfect for these cold winter days that we are having.  Verdict : ~ Love the Hainanese Chicken rice and I am sure I'll be a regular from now on. ~ They also have the Indonesian Chicken which I will need to try next time. ~ One of the best service I've had for a while at a Chinese place and love how energetic and smiling they all are."}
{"text":"Wow, okay, colour me impressed! This was a random walk in as I was in the plaza after running errands and I'm glad I did. Entering the restaurant I didn't have high expectations for it since it was empty save for the employees having late lunch. Looking at the menu didn't impress me much either because the food they had looked like any other HK cafe you'd find in the GTA.   Luckily I was proven wrong. Originally I had wanted the salmon gravlax that came with noodles but they ran out of the salmon so I went with the baked fish in rosé sauce. I opted for the spaghetti over the rice. The fish was crispy on the outside and went extremely well with the cheese. The sauce to spaghetti ratio was perfect as anymore would've masked the enjoyment of the noodles.   Their food comes with a small selection of drinks: lemon water, lemon tea, and coffee.   Service was great! Waitress was very accommodating. Though something I'd like to express is that they shouldn't have spoke mandarin to me as if they knew for sure that I spoke the language. It just struck me as weird because she spoke to me in fluent English starting off and then came back later to speak specifically in Chinese. We live in Canada, don't automatically assume every person with an Asian face speaks the same language as you."}
