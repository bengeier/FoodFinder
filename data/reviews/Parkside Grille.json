{"text":"Good food for a good price. Very convenient. No place for eating inside but have a courtyard out back to sit outside. Good selection as far as the menu goes as well."}
{"text":"We were out in the Chagrin Falls area  and got hungry for lunch.  This take out only place proved to be just the ticket.  Situated right next to Yours Truly this place has a great menu of hamburgers and wraps.  My husband ordered a tasty ranch bacon chicken wrap.  I ordered the special which was a chicken cheddar wrap.  In both wraps the chicken was tender and juicy.  My wrap lacked flavor.....just bland.  We were happy with the healthy choices....a little more flavor would have been great.  The price was right too!"}
{"text":"My me and my friends go there sometimes and it's awesome the staff is nice clean and fun I recommend the chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"For what this place is it is great!  The seating area outside is nice on a good day.  But, most importantly, the tuna melt wrap is amazing.  Easily the best tuna melt I've had."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Although the wait can be lengthy, the family who owns the grill is friendly and works quickly. The strawberry milkshake and French fries were the highlight of the meal. I got the buffalo chicken wrap which is one of the best buffalo chicken wraps I have ever had. It was full of flavor filled with lots of veggie. My boyfriend's bacon cheddar wrap was tasty (even without the sour cream). Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. Just an order counter with take out food. Fortunately there is a park with table seating must outside. I got a Gyro combo with the Cajun fries. Great chance of pace from normal French fries. My food was excellent, and the other I saw being prepared like good too"}
{"text":"This is an icon in Chagrin Falls.  Unfortunately, the food is mostly preprocessed and they warm it up and add a wrap to it.  My barbeque beef was barbeque, but where was the REAL beef.  The kind that is hand torn and been soaking in barbeque sauce all day?  Yeah, no.  It was some immatiation meat, that I had in grade school and also seen in nursing homes.  Very disappointing.  It could be much more, if they tried or cared."}
{"text":"I don't know the guys name who runs this joint, but he is fantastic.  It's only open in the summer but you get some really good food here.  I would rather eat here than at Daves Cosmic Subs any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  This guy keeps it real by just cooking good food, not wasting his time painting John Lennon on the ceiling and wearing his unbuttoned shirt with chest hair hanging out while he dishes out food like Dave does.

The wraps are excellent as are all the sides.  The bummer is that you get your drinks in styrofoam cups, but I guess that is a small point of contention.  There is a little park where you can eat your lunch right next to the restaurant, or take a stroll and eat near the falls.  

A word of caution- this is only a take out restaurant.  There are no rest rooms and inside the place can get pretty hot during the summer, so if you sweat a lot like me, send in a friend to order."}
{"text":"This is a very convenient place to stop at if you need a quick bite!  You can either grab a seat at the patio or just take it to go since it's already packed in to go containers. 

Their menu mostly consists of easy to eat on the go items like sandwiches, burgers, and wraps. Just like a classic sandwich shop their sides mostly consist of chips and fries. 

This is definitely a neighborhood favorite among the younger crowd as it's easy to grab something to eat at after school and the very casual atmosphere makes it easy to grab a seat on the patio with a larger group. There's hardly any wait time for your food so if you're in a rush or just very hungry this is a very convenient spot. 

While they do have a few healthier options I would more so recommend this spot if you're in the mood for something not so healthy and more on the greasier side.  The food is also affordably priced so that always a plus!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine- delicious! Walk in, outside seating only- best fries on earth."}
{"text":"Great food and a pretty little outdoor courtyard to eat it in. (no indoor seating.)

Highlights for me, where the seasoned fries and chocolate milkshake.

But the healthy stuff was good too. My two-year-old and five-year-old kill the turkey club. And the chicken fingers were the kind that adults can enjoy."}
{"text":"This blows all other take-out away.  Stumbled upon it when I had some time to kill.  I was surprised to see it is just a counter -- no inside seating.  But there's a nice outdoor season area.  Extensive menu and fast, friendly service. I ordered the Greek wrap with chicken, and it was better that what I've gotten in a sit-in down place.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger wrap is an idea whose time has come. The juicy burger, crispy bacon in a bed of lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayo and red onion was a piece of low-carb awesomeness. Ingredients were fresh.

There's a bit of an outdoor sitting area right next to it. The person behind me ordered the teriyaki chicken wrap, maybe I'll get that next time...

Good fast service and bang for buck."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Got the cheeseburger, with fries and a slice to drink...very satisfied.  The wraps are very tasty too."}
{"text":"I have a business around the corner from the Parkside and hit them for lunch more days than not.  Great Food made by nice folks.  It's as fast as McJunque, but so much better, and can be healthy if you order right!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in chagrin falls by far. Fast and friendly service with quality food. The bacon chicken ranch wrap and Cajun fries are amazing."}
{"text":"The woman who took our order also prepped our order, multitasking with another cool, and making a shake, while serving up a dish for another customer.  I wish all cooks and business served up this kind of work ethic.  The food was only okay, leaving my taste buds a bit unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Nestled behind Yours Truly you'll find a delightful little grille serving up the best sandwiches in town. This is a mom and pop establishment with friendly service.  Ok....let's talk about the food.  Droooooool....three letters: B....L....T. Leave your Lipitor at home and treat your taste buds to \"6\" juicy bacon strips, real tomatoes, lettuce and mayo. The Gyros are addictive. You will need a 12 step program to get off them. Food, service, and atmosphere get five stars!"}
{"text":"After six long years since my last visit, I finally returned to this place. I went with a friend, and our total cost was almost $20 for two wraps, a drink, and a side of cajun fries. A bit more expensive than I remember!

I remember being in love with the tuna wrap and cajun fries while in high school. But, when I reunited with this order it was just mediocre. The wrap wasn't as stuffed as I remember, and I couldn't even find/taste the tomatoes. My friend wasn't too into her chicken teriyaki wrap either. For the cost, I was hoping for a bit more UMPH when I was eating.

Extremely friendly service, though. And I love that it's an order-and-go type of place. We got to sit outside, enjoy the weather, and people watch."}
{"text":"My favorite take-out is Parkside.  You get fresh food at a great price!  Their grilled chicken is amazing on a sandwich or sliced into a wrap.  If you are hungry and in a hurry, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place! Order and go. The wraps have great flavor - love both the chicken caesar and the cheeseburger wraps. Yummy grilled flavor. Burgers are ok. There's no indoor seating, but this place is perfect for take-out."}
{"text":"Working in Chagrin Falls, this place is a weekly staple. Quick service, great food, and a friendly staff. I prefer the tuna melt wrap or the hidden menu item, the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Frank Wrap. Such a delicious wrap. Have to top it off with Cajun fries too."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. My group ordered the chicken bacon ranch wrap, cheeseburger, gyro, two kids grilled geese meals, and a large order of cheese bacon fries. Everything was great besides the cheese bacon fries. The cheese was not melted so nothing stuck to the fries. I took them back in and asked if there was any way they could melt them. The owner was kind of rude and said he sells thousands of them that way. Ya okay guy......."}
{"text":"Parkside is phenomenal!! it is a Chagrin staple and a must try if in the area. I have not found make places - actually zero - that do parkside does and does it well. A wrap with chicken in it actually has a real chicken breast in it and not some nasty rubber looking thing. Everything is fresh and delicious. They also have great french fries and smoothies. I go in there at least once every few weeks and am always greeted with a smile and the same question, \"Do you want hot sauce with that?\". It's always great to be remembered! 

If I were to recommend anything, I'd recommend everything - but a few of my favorites are the bacon,chicken, ranch wrap - Teriyaki chicken wrap - the New York wrap with grilled onions and not raw. I love pretty much every wrap I've eaten and will continue to go to Parkside as long as the door is open."}
{"text":"The best take-out restaurant ever!! I had the buffalo wrap and it was addicting. Their food is always fresh and hot. Good pricing - good menu. I would come here every day if I lived in Chagrin falls."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Good, quick eats for a very fair price. Really good food. Lovely outdoor patio eating under the trees. Classic Chagrin Falls!"}
{"text":"It's a solid 4 star walk through take out sandwich spot.  Nestled next to Your's Truly, this spot is TINY!!   Everything on the menu is good. Prices are a little expensive, but ok. They specialize in sandwiches, wraps and burgers.  My favorite lunch there is the gyro and cajun seasoned fries.  The honey mustard bbq chicken wrap and the bacon chicken ranch wrap is wonderful too.  The burgers are great- they are offered in singles or doubles with or without cheese and various toppings.  Parkside offers plenty of salads, and plenty of stuff for the kids to like (grilled cheese, blt, chicken tenders, hot dogs).   Best to visit in the warm weather months, it's a treat to sit in the park or next to the falls and enjoy some great take out."}
