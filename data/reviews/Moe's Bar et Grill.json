The smoked meat was ordinary, salty and chemically processed. Not the original smoked meat that was served years past. Fries were hyper greasy and tasteless. The coleslaw was okay. 

The waitress was nice and she understood our predicament, but her manager was an  ... anyway, you know what I mean.

I'll upload a pic of that menu and tell me if I was wrong to expect fries and coleslaw with my smoked meat sandwich."}
