{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but the service is a joke, and the smell of cigarettes is overwhelming.  I will get pizza again from here, but it will certainly be to go."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through grub hub. Can't believe there aren't any reviews. Everything was delicious and fresh. Ordered rotisserie chicken...a half chicken with seasoned waffle cut fries and Greek salad. The salad was amazing and loved the garlic sauce that came with the chicken. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm rating the cold food they delivered to me on a moped. For sofa pizza, it wasn't horrible, but I will say I was starving and tried catching wild rabbit prior to the food getting to my house. I probably would have considered dumpster diving. 

The jalape√±o poppers were probably the best part of the meal.  I'll just leave it at that. 

I will say that when I called wondering where my food was, the guy said he upgraded my 12\" pizza to a 16\" pizza at no extra charge. It really was 4 additional inches of disappointment."}
{"text":"The chicken gyro is very fresh and the fries are soooo good!  Try the fresh salad too"}
