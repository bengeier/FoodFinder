{"text":"Service was terrible. The food was mediocre quality. Maybe it's a place you just come for coffee or ice cream. Ordered a egg sandwich, egg was cooked well not over cooked but the bread was soggy. They got the order wrong too originally bring 2/3 things ordered wrong. Anyway I recommend the Starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"Waiting for McMichaels Art Gallery to open at 10am, so we came here for breakfast and coffee.  I had a latte and a classic breakfast (toast, eggs (substituted with egg white), peameal, home fries).

Decent coffee, right portion for breakfast for me (I prefer eating just enough vs having the plate overloaded).  

Only negative was the potato, it was just sliced and a bit dry.  

Sat outside on the patio, even though it was raining, the big patio umbrellas provided shelter."}
{"text":"Went: Sun May 24 2015, 8 p.m. (70/100)

We went here after dinner at Longchamps. I recall having some sweet ice cream dessert. It did not look that different from dessert you could get anywhere and I don't remember it being above average.
3.5 stars, rounded to 4.0."}
{"text":"The patio is cute because of the location in Kleinburg, very pretty in the summer. Food isn't that great, and the service is just alright."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before McMichael's. It turned out to be a poor choice. My husband had the traditional breakfast and I had the Western Omelette. We both also had coffees.

First the good -- great patio on a beautiful day, eggs were fresh and coffee was good.
Now the rest -- 
1) The one girl should consider a career in the police force rather than hospitality. It was not yet busy, so they had many open tables. This did not prevent her from busily directing customers who are couples (sometimes after they already chose a table and sat down -- I saw this twice!) -- against their wills -- to smaller tables in the sun because she did not want 2 people sitting at a table for four. She tried to get us to sit in the sun (when we had already picked a table in the shade). Meanwhile, there was a group of 10-12 bikers who would just randomly spread out at different tables, sometimes 2 people would move to an empty table and just talk with no food/drink at all...  so clearly, there are different service experiences here.
2) Questionable food safety. Our first ketchup bottle was just on the table and felt warm to the touch and hasn't been cleaned in several months. When we pointed it out and asked for a different one, a similarly looking bottle with caked on dried ketchup and banged up cap was brought back. I'm not sure how many times the bottle has been \"warmed up\" in the sun and brought back inside, and out again... their definition of \"clean\" is a little different from most other people in the food services industry.
3) Food was meh. Other than the eggs,the potato and the toast, were really not that great. The Western Omelette was actually semi-scrambled and folded rather than a true omelette with a filling. It just seems that not a lot of effort goes into the quality of their food preparation.
4) Nickel & Dime -- $10 for breakfast (~market), but +$2 if you want rye toast, $2.50 for each cup of coffee (husband had a fill-up and was charged for 2 separate cups of coffee) 

It's too bad. It looked like a cute place, I really wanted to like it there..."}
{"text":"You know what makes me happy? Breakfast! That's right, breakfast is the one meal a day that always makes me feel good. I'm never disgustingly full after it, it gives me energy for my day and done right, it can be enough to carry me through the day!

Don't let the name of this location dissuade you, while they do have an assortment of baked goodies (cookies, cakes, pies, muffins) on display and ready for you to munch on, their expansive menu (written on a chalk board wall behind the counter.... the whole counter) is filled with delicious all-day breakfast options, sandwiches, fresh made soups and an endless lunch menu option. 

I had a breakfast with 3 eggs, toast, and peamael bacon, and tomato slices. A basic breakfast but did the trick IMO.

It's the perfect spot to come for breakfast and stay all day for coffee(s) and lunch... and maybe a little snack in the afternoon. While their aren't a ton of spots inside for seating (perhaps 12-16) the summer time patio is elegant and HUGE, easily doubling (if not tripling the seating). 

They've got an endless stream of customers popping in and out for coffees, espressos, cappuccinos and other caffeinated beverages. An impressively loyal crowd given that there is a Starbucks almost directly across the street. I'm glad to see the locals of Kleinburg here supporting their local spot over the \"big guys\" I will definitely do the same from now on.

Also, I couldn't be sure but I'm fairly confident they had some ready to go chicken/meat pies sitting on the counter for lunches as well - if so, I plan on coming back way more often in the winter.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Coffee was ok. Patio good.
BUT ... we got a slice of chocolate cheesecake, and I can best describe the taste as an 'old ladie's closet.' The cake was definetly not fresh, and it tasted like moldy. Except for one man the rest of the employees were generaly not friendly. 
We saw the starbucks across, with a lot of people, but wanted to try something more authentic... I would say, if you just want a coffee, here is let's say 'not too bad,' but I would discourage anyone to eat here. 
I know Cookie Crumble can do better than this if they wanted! 

... disappointed (_;)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty average at best, ive been here a few times to give it a chance and was never Impressed to repeat again."}
{"text":"We went in just before 3 pm.  We were lured in by an \"All Day Breakfast\".  This turned out to be a lie, for us, anyway.

We were told we were too late and handed a lunch menu.  We were served below average grilled cheese sandwiches.

Just as we were finishing up, several breakfast were served to a party that came in well after we did.

Very disappointing.  Can't recommend to anyone.  Service was while not rude,neither friendly or helpful."}
{"text":"I was at this place to get a latte two weeks ago with my brother. And I liked the service and the coffee. So I decided to go back there today for another coffee. I was just there 5 mins ago (1.15pm) and the girl who made my coffee was so cold and didn't even acknowledged my presence.  She didn't even look at me or even smile. I was totally ignored by her. And she heated up the milk and just dumped it into my coffee like she doesn't care. That didn't seem like something that a  professional coffee maker would do. Also the coffee didn't taste anything like the one I got from there two weeks ago. I'm not going back to this place again. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my worst dining experiences. It took forever, the food was \"ok,\" and the  service was terrible."}
{"text":"Ended up going there for coffee. Ordered a cappuccino, cake and quiche. Overall was okay. They were closing by the time I went so they didn't really have much items to try."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries like once was. 
A great brunch place in the summer with the patio in place. 

Highly recommended.  Service is a bit hit or miss with stuff and management."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here for a lunch but sadly it was extremely frustrating and disappointing. With a full house, they did not pay attention to the tables that needed to order inside and outside in the patio. At least two tables around me felt the same frustration. When you need to wave the server down multiple times, you are failing. Pancakes were light but very bland. All the maple syrup couldn't help it. I understand that it's a small place but there's no excuse for this. Food was lukewarm which was not acceptable either. We saw customers coming in from outside asking to take their order."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and cozy the food and dessert all fresh ! They have everything you would enjoy ending wth a great hot beverage. I will defiantly go again ana can't wait !"}
{"text":"Pleasant patio. ok coffees, but freaked out when I saw the dirty bathrooms, Moreover, food was stored in the bathroom -- frighteningly unsanitary. Kitchen was unappetizing. Defines greasy spoon. Service was pleasant but  very slow. A tourist trappe. Looks like local folks eat across the street at Starbucks"}
