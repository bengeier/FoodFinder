{"text":"We drove here because of the reviews, but it doesn't exist! The sign by the street says it's there, but you can't find it in the shopping/restaurant area. Wish I could rate it, but the building is completely empty even though there are other places to eat in this one area.  You have been forewarned."}
{"text":"I LOVE burgers and was floored to stumble across this restaurant ... place looks really cool but what a huge disappointment!! The burger was dry and tasteless and none of the staff seemed to care ... not even a hello!!"}
{"text":"As of 7/23/08 this location is closed.  It is being turned into a new business, a Korean fusion style restaurant.  According to the new owner, the business shut down about 6 months ago."}
{"text":"Hooray for Simply Burgers!!  It can be hard for us vegetarians of the world to go to a burger joint and find anything on the menu we can eat.  But not at Simply Burgers.  I was so excited to find out that they offer garden burgers AND even vegan burgers too.  Now that is awesome.  Not that many places remember the non-meat eaters, so I get really psyched when someone does.  I'll never understand why so many restaurants forget to add a few meatless options on their menus...but that's beside the point.  Simply Burgers has garden burgers and they're really good.  Burgers come with french fries or a garden salad and the shakes are sooooooo good.   Oh and of course they have regular burgers too and even pizza!  I wish they'd open up one of these closer to me, but it's probably better they don't because I'd go all the time!"}
{"text":"Yowga-ga-boing!  Excellent variety of signature burger combinations.  In particular, the one I tried (Desert Heat) was a taste sensation.  You don't find too many places offering both Angus and Kobe.  The buns were higher quality than your average burger stand fare.  The produce was nice and fresh.  Crisp lettuce, and the tomato was deep red, not that wilted yellow disc you sometimes get with the other guys.  Their beer battered onion-rings were perfectly crunchy and great tasting.  The fries tasted great, although they could have been a little more crisp.  Great selection of sodas (including Jones brand), energy drinks, and a unique variety of beers & wine coolers/malt beverages.  Trendy and clean upbeat environment.  Friendly staff.  The hostess was a cutie.  The grill guys paid attention to our order (I actually received a medium-rare patty).  The manager even came out and greeted us.  Maybe I was there on a good night, but you can bet I'll be back soon to try that seared Ahi burger.  In-n-out is good, but not even close to this good.  ~Swoop"}
