{"text":"Bon, vraiment pas cher, sercice très gentil. Plein de sortes de sauces qu'on peut ajouter soi même au comptoir. J'ai pris le poulet sur riz."}
{"text":"Was visiting Montreal from Toronto this weekend and wanted authentic and cheap Japanese. Thank goodness for Yelp! Based on all the good reviews for Japote, I had to get takeout while I just happened to be in the neighbourhood. Japote is not only good value for your money but the people who run it are real Japanese and they're super nice! That's what I call good customer service. They make the food fresh and they take the time to explain what sauces go with which entree that you order. They have sauces such as sesame, sweet soy, ginger to drizzle over your meal. Really good food and such a steal at $6.50 including tax for a large bowl. Would def come back if I am back in Montreal."}
{"text":"The only place in the Faubourg food court with a consistent line up. At least that is what I found during the lunch time rush. The service is fast despite the line. The food is simple, cheap but very tasty. Don't expect a large variety of choices but what they serve they do well. There's so sushi here but you will find Japanese bistro style hot dishes served with rice. Everything comes in a variety of sizes depending on how hungry you are. The most expensive dish was eggs and eel on riceThey do charge an extra 50 cents for take out orders and only take cash. A good choice for lunch if you are in the neighborhood. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little corner of this food court, food was outstanding and authentic tasting.  Had the ebi ten don and was fantastic, couldn't ask for a better quick bite, very pleased and the owners were really nice"}
{"text":"Bought two chicken rice bowls here in preparation for late night studying at school. They weren't bad but they weren't oh-my-God-this-is-so-good. I'd probably still be a return customer. It's good, it's cheap, just not incredible."}
{"text":"good, clean and cheap food served with humility and a warm smile. definitely will be back once the semester starts at concordia."}
{"text":"I've been to the FG building a lot for classes but never bothered to try this place  Today my friend wanted to go so I went with him and it the menu turned out to be half the price that I thought it would be! I ordered the vegetable tempura dish and a vegetarian croquette, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Restaurant dans une foire alimentaire.  Restaurant typiquement japonais qui me rappelle mon voyage au Japon.  Nous avons mangé la grande portion de riz avec anguilles et celle avec poulet. C'était très bon. Le restaurant nous permet d'assaisonner par la suite nous même notre plat avec une dizaine de sauces différentes  (Mayo épicée, gingembre, soya, etc.)  Le personnel était également très sympathique.  Pour les deux plats, portion large, c'était moins de 15$.  Le seul bémol c'est le manque de légumes dans les plats, mais considérant que les portions coûtent environ 6$ taxes incluses, on ne peut pas s'en plaindre."}
{"text":"A fried of mine told me about Japote and it is awesome.When it comes to fast, cheap, authentic Japanese food, you can't do better. Typical fare such as donburi are plentiful and you can eat well for five bucks.   Only thing I would change? How awesome would it be if they delivered!"}
{"text":"With all the great reviews on Yelp for Japote I had very high expectations, I was not disappointed!  I had the #3 chicken, it was so good!  and so cheap!  only $5 for a decent size plate of authentic Japanese food!  The place was packed full of asians I think most of them Japanese, which I think says something about the authentic-ness of the food.  I know I will be going back there if I am near Guy-Concordia and am hungry for some excellent cheap Japanese!"}
{"text":"The food served are authentic Japanese comfort dishes! They make a killer croquette, add it to your plate for about $1.  Went there twice, and the curry was disappointing: just sauce, lacking meat or veggies. However, I got the oyakodon the second time and really enjoyed it! You might be tempted to layer on the sauces they provide, but the main dish is already really flavourful.  I usually get medium for lunch, but they have 3 sizes for all dishes.  Would go again to try the other food!"}
{"text":"I tore myself away from my old Faubourg standards, Tikka and Bangkok, to give this always-busy place a try. This is by far the best food court Japanese food I've had in the city and probably the cheapest. A large serving of most things goes for $6, tax included. The staff is friendly. Best of all, for this lover of condiments, there is a self-serve sauce bar with about two dozen sauces in big squeeze bottles -- including several kinds of spicy mayo. There is even a chalkboard recommending sauces to go with different menu items, and the staff will helpfully suggest a squeeze of this or that. I had an extremely liberal hand with the spicy mayo and didn't feel at all judged. Best."}
{"text":"For those poor college students out there that can't afford to dine in Montreal's typical expensive dining restaurants where you'd have to include a 15% tip, and for those that loves cheap and great Japanese food, then this is the place to go!!!  A hidden gem in Faubourg food court, the small restaurant offers a variety of Japanese rice dishes that ranges from small ($4.5), medium ($5), and large($6) bowls (tax included, other dishes can be slightly more expensive). Their food is incredibly consistent and satisfying for its price and their service is tres rapide! It's a must go for people that can't afford expensive food and would like a quick eatery."}
{"text":"A cute place in the downtown good court close to Concordia. reasonably priced food ranging from 5-9$ of difference sizes. Fast service. The food tastes homey but slightly on the salty side but they give you lots if rice to balance it out. Super nice owners!"}
{"text":"This place scores as high as the NaCl content in their dishes (too salty) -- and for that it's a good 4.5.   The flavours are well balanced and the meats are well executed (not dry, not burnt), but the amount of salt can only remind me of one thing - the Atlantic Ocean.  Apart from the NaCl episode, which is clearly assault (a salt) on my tongue, the pricing vs the quantity is great. A large plate costs 6$ (not very large), but it's enough for a hungry person to go without food for 5h.   My favorites are the #0 (ginger pork) and #3 (soy chicken). I heard my friends say #2 (beef) is not good, so I never bothered trying.   They have 5-6 great homemade(?) sauces and some pickled veggies that you are free to add if you desire extra flavour. However, I'm certain it's best to taste the food as is (no extra sauce) in order to enjoy the nuances. So my recommendation is: The sauces may taste good but will overpower said nuances. It's best to add only a bit at a time."}
