{"text":"Other reviews are crazy. Great homemade pizza! Fresh bread sticks.  THE best wings ever. Great flavor slightly crispy.  Meat pizza is the best!  Also have great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good pizza and very quick when ordered through pickup. Only complaint would be when not open the phone rings and rings versus having an answering machine stating they are closed."}
{"text":"Still the best pizza!! Brought back lots of childhood memories. Location was much different than their previous and was kind of odd, but overlook that and enjoy the pizza! Yum!"}
