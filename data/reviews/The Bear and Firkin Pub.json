{"text":"The staff must take the example of their restaurant's name to heart; customer service was practically non-existent, as if hibernating. It takes multiple wave-downs to get any service at all, and even then, it takes forever to order. We've been here several times, against our better judgement and every time has been the same. We gave up after waiting 15 mins to even order anything (drinks even; we weren't given a drink menu) and left. Won't be back; especially with increasing competition nearby."}
{"text":"My wife, son and I ate here Sunday. It was somewhat busy so service, although good was understandably slower. 
My wings were really crispy. Not jumbo though so $13 for a pound was a bit much. 
My wife had Chef's chicken curry and enjoyed the flavours. 
My sons Firkin burger was huge and tasty. I traded a wing for a bite. 
All in all a cool place to eat. But not cool temperature wise. The air conditioner must have been broken."}
{"text":"Was here tonight for a friend's birthday and to be honest the food was really good.

The Irish Nachos rocked. It's made with waffle fries instead of the usual nacho chips and has melted cheese, bacon, green onions and sour cream on it! What's not to love! The wings were small but very tasty and cooked well. Had an Irish Coffee to polish it off with which was also nice. 

It was clean, not too crowded and the servers were very helpful. Def will go back."}
{"text":"Note: the photos with this review were before the menu was changed. 

We went there for the Yorkshire puddings and discovered that they were off the menu

I had the bucket of fried things.   $18.00 which was pretty steep for an assortment of French fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, tater tots and deep fried pickles.  The wife had the curry which was mild and a bit bland."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a few of my friends for one of their birthdays. The bouncers were very rude to my friend, saying that she stumbled getting out of the cab, but she was not drunk. They were practically mocking us and said that they won't serve her (they're bouncers, not servers). They made her cry. Unacceptable. They lost out on our business (there were 7 of us). Inside, there were only people at 2 tables and this was a Friday night. They judged my friend before we even walked up the stairs to the door. They didn't  analyze her face up close. Not cool, guys."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch the other day. The sign said 'Grab a Seat' but I suggest you make your presence known or you run the risk of not being noticed.

Only after we had gotten up to get our own menus did our server come over and apologise. I noticed her sitting at the bar having lunch when we walked in and considering the layout of the restaurant, I'm not sure how she missed us.

My husband selected one of the specials of the day, a Rubin sandwich with Beef Barley Soup ($10)... I, of course, opted for the Bangers, Beans and Mash ($11).

I can't comment on the sandwich as I'm not a fan of Rubins however, the half spoonful of soup my husband left me to try was delicious! He obviously enjoyed it as well, hence the pittance he left me.

I have to say though, the bangers and mash were some of the best I've had in a while (apart from my own). The mash was so smooth, not a lump in sight and the beans tasted homemade. They supported three large bangers which were smothered in sauteed onions. I was actually surprised at how much food $11 got me. Great value.

I think the restaurant itself could do with a renovation to bring it up to date but overall, if it's pub grub you're looking for, this is your place."}
{"text":"Angie was our waitress and she was wonderful, very friendly and took great care to make sure we were looked after. The food was great, fresh and tasty. Comfy spot and close to home, it may just become a regular hang out for us :)"}
{"text":"Was ok i ordered fish and chips, the fish batter was like cutting through wood.   It was very dry inside.

There was a table of drunk guys and we almost left because they were so rowdy and moved outside. 

Server was good to us and friendly.

Not sure if we will ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, great food and menu. The service was good, however the 2 beers I requested they were out of stock"}
{"text":"Second time being here. Last year we came for drinks and the Mac and cheese, and we remembered the Mac and cheese being absolutely incredible. Yesterday was no different, and it was even better than I remembered. Best I've ever had and I've tried a lot. 

We started with the Irish Nachis where they use waffle fries instead of chips and oh. my. goodness. I don't think I ever want regular nacho chips again. 

For a beautiful Saturday afternoon on the patio, service was great. 

Will definitely be back again -
Highly recommend the Irish Nachos and Mac and cheese with bacon!"}
