{"text":"This is my first post to Yelp. It has taken a lot for me to actually do this as I my self am in customer service. This McDonalds is horrible. It is filthy! I drive a lifted vehicle and you can see the floors and counters while I'm in the drive through , atrocious. I travel a lot and see a lot of drive throughs and this is bad. They're constantly out of supplies (Coffe, soda, ketchup).  I am currently sitting at a booth that half of the cushions are missing, no sign, tape or anything warning someone not to sit there. Because of convenience I try it once a month but I will drive the extra distance to another one. Please, someone raise the standards.  OMG. I just checked my order. Took them 3 times to get it right......"}
{"text":"Food is always good, depending on the time of the day, they seem a bit understaffed.  Nice and clean inside the restaurant though, nice environment for a meal"}
{"text":"Food is par for the course at this McDonald's location however the service is a bit slow and they continue to get my order wrong nearly every time I'm there."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has a contemporary feel to it in terms of decor and it's situated in the heart of campus town but the prices are the same as at any other McDonald's. The same holds true for taste.   They seem to have stepped up customer service of late. So I'm giving them an extra star for going the extra mile and even saying \"Have a nice day\" when I picked up my order. Score!   My favorite item on the menu's the sundae. It's quite refreshing on a hot day. And at less than 350 calories and under $1.50, Hot Fudge Sundae's both cheap and not very unhealthy."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst McDonald's in the GTA. Expect a long wait for a messed up order."}
{"text":"realized they forgot my fish sandwich and Mc-chicken after i got home. Called back several time, no one ever picked up the phone. What do you do in this situation? i wonder i will ever got my food/money back... sign..."}
{"text":"Either you're open to midnight or you're not. Please change your hours of operation if your teenage employees don't want to work their full shifts."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting, I know it's a McDonald's but seriously, this place is a must if you like ignorant philipinos and cold food"}
{"text":"This burgers are full of fat and byproducts.   This honestly even the best McDonald's  can't be considered good. Watch the movie supersize me."}
{"text":"A review for McDonald's? Why not..? ;)  I visited this location on my way to work this morning. It was the only restaurant in the food court that was open so early on Sunday morning. Located just across from the Toronto Coach Terminal, there were quite a few people enjoying their breakfast there, but it was very quiet. The service was pretty quick, and the servers were very polite.  I won't ever deny this -- McDonald's breakfast is truly a guilty pleasure of mine. I try not to have it too often though. It is always greasy and cheesy, but so delicious! The McMuffin I had this morning was as hot and crispy as my hash brown (I can't ever have McDonald's breakfast without ordering at least one hash brown!). I do not remember the last time I had a hot and CRISPY English muffin at McDonald's. It made the sandwich taste so much better..."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds I've ever attended. I've rarely bought anything from this location over the last 7 years, & I wonder how they're still in business. Yet it always amuses me at how slow the service can be there, even in person. I wonder if they're sleeping on the job sometimes."}
{"text":"I ordered cinnamelts and the sticker on the box said best by 10/24- 4 days prior to me ordering them. I had gone through the drive thru and didn't realize it until I had arrived at work. So I tried calling the location and the phone rang and rang. I called several times and no one answered. I finally called customer service and they had to get in touch with the manager for me. I got a phone call from a very rude manager. As I expressed my concern that the product I recieved had expired several days ago, she didn't seem to care and cut me off telling me to come in and get my money back. I don't care about $2.50, I care about people eating nasty, expired food. There is obvious neglect and poor food handling and food saftey. I will never eat at McDonalds again. (Probably for the best)."}
{"text":"Junk food ruined by the trash people inside and outside the store, I want to see drunk homeless losers up close I'll walk down an alley, not into this place. Do your job. Remove them. I've seen problems too many times based on the fact thay your workers aren't smart enough to have the police remove them."}
{"text":"The Drive Thru ladies are very hard working and have great customer service. Specifically there are 3 workers who have amazed me ( they have a brown ethnicity ). 10/10."}
{"text":"I would honestly give them zero stars for their service!! It's a 24 hour mcdonalds that tells you to wait one second before they take your order and then tells you they're closed when you go to order when all the lights are still on. Fuck this McDonald's!! Go somewhere else and spend your money."}
{"text":"The worst run McDonald's in history. All I wanted was one Diet Coke. I pull up to the drive thru and I'm the only customer. I then wait SEVEN minutes for someone to take my order, no one ever comes. So I decided I'm finally done with this location and go to leave. Turns out there is one person at the second window STILL waiting for their food. I then wait ANOTHER 13 minutes for them to get their food. I can't imagine how long they waited. I still bet they got half their food order as is the normality here   All in all, I waited 20 minutes to get a Diet Coke and didn't even accomplish that. The manager, employees, and McDonald's itself should fire and replace the entire staff. Will never be here again."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this one is still in business.  I wonder if management even reads these reviews?  Are YOU going to this McD's after reading all of these reviews?  Geeezzz, higher prices than other McD's, terrible service, inattentive servers, wrong orders, long waits...I have tried this one several times.  It's close to home but bad service once, shame on you McD's, bad service twice and I still go back?  Shame on me. I'll just get my coffee at home."}
{"text":"Don't like this place. I got an expired milk for breakfast. I attempted to return it. All they had was expired milk in there fridge. I was offer coffee from the very rude manager. I paid much more for the milk than there few cents coffee... Will not be returning for a meal here :( shame on you McDonalds!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the slowest McDonalds in Calgary, hands down... Nobody in the drive through except me, and nobody at the counter inside and you still get told to pull ahead and wait in the reserved spot and all I'm getting is a coffee, this has happened more often than not... Don't go here..."}
{"text":"Sometimes they give you old stale hard burgers if you come after 5, so I usually won't take the risk.  Customer service is alright. Eating indoors is lovely they have leather chairs and flat screens it's really nice."}
{"text":"Service is the worst I ever experienced.  How is possible to no even be served... I was the only one in line.. the only one there.. just me.. Ordered Just a coffee and a  MC muffin   This twice now at this location.. I walked out after 20 min with nothing   Very poor store  Stay in the drive through.   hopefully they would not  over look you there.  So disappointed"}
{"text":"Worst MCdonalds ever, if i could give zero i would. Super slow and irresponsible workers."}
{"text":"I've never seen a McDonald's that makes more errors at the drive thru. If they make a mistake they simply say, \"oh, sorry\" and then move on with their day. I'm not even sure the manager knows about these mistakes. I can understand a mistake now and then, but why is it a weekly occurrence. I'd drive to another McDonald's if there was one in the area that didn't add 20 minutes to my trip."}
{"text":"This place sucks the bag; worst mc d I've ever been to.service?!&@\" food  cleanliness  nobody gives a shit about their job at this place.management no where to be seen?"}
{"text":"Not my favourite location of McDonald's. It is always full of loud high school students. The service at this place is average, although they were times when they got my order wrong or times when the service was taking so much longer than usual."}
{"text":"I tried the new build your own burger deal. It was surprisingly good. It actually looks just like the picture. The service was superb and the place was very clean. I never thought I would give a McDonald's 5 stars. I rarely even eat at McDonald's but this one truly earned it."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the new commercials that state McDonalds has improved! Not even close to the quality of the surrounding fast food chains. Horrible artisian chicken sandwich, burnt and not even a whole piece of chicken not to mention worth $5.  So disappointed! Will pick a different restaurant next time for sure."}
{"text":"Brand new McDonald's up in Brampton.   It was super busy but thankfully they have a self serve scene.   We were able to order our food on a touch screen    Got a number and waited in a line.   Food came quickly which was surprising because of how busy it was.    There are iPads set up to play on, however they both were broken    Nice patio"}
{"text":"Just waited inside for about 15 minutes. We were the only people at the register however, no one came to take our order. The restaurant was busy but it blows my mind that they don't have someone dedicated to taking orders inside the store? We went back to the car and went to the drive through and were served immediately. Just goes to show their drive through times are more important than their customers who come into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow in this outlet obviously nobody gives a fucks. This is the 2nd time I ordered hotcakes here - the first time i got 2 hotcakes only, and today I didn't receive any butter/syrup. What am I supposed to eat my hotcakes with??????"}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever!!!! Haven't moved in 15 minutes!!  C'mon!  Really?!?!?   Get it together!"}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast here,  and the cashier got my order wrong,  I was dinning in and told him that ,  but they gave me a to go bag. The soda machine was messed up,  every soda I choose was flat, not mention they were out of ketchup,  so plain hash brown for me and every other customer.  Stay away from this mcdonalds as I will."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the only food place open 24 hours on Green St. Pretty fast considering how busy they get on weekend nights. Aside from that they're like any other McDonald's."}
{"text":"I really liked this location but I think it is starting to go downhill.  Fast, good food.  Why does the manager pace the floor while you eat doing absolutely nothing when all their tables are dirty?  Not a very good use of staff and does nothing for atmosphere  I often have to clean my own table.  The staff putting the order together are starting to get a little slow and don't know who is supposed to do the drinks while your food is out getting cold.  But the Manager paces not looking at anyone unless they are just walking in and bothers them about how they are going to pay.  You can save a lot of money getting rid of that salary and placing a cheaper worker on the floor or at the till ready to serve people, instead of pace around them when they are trying to eat."}
{"text":"The black girl working here has the worst \"I don't want to be here\" face. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!! The little punks working here don't give a shit and food is terrible!! There service sucks and they messed up our order twice!! They stare at you like they're lost and don't know what's going on!! Do not go there!! This is why we don't ever eat this nasty shit!!"}
{"text":"We had a great McDonald's lunch - staff courteous and helpful. This was a fairly new location in front of a Sams store- very modern - more like a nice restaurant rather than a fast foods restaurant."}
{"text":"Im sick and tired of owners giving there last dollar to make a buisness thrive and unappreciative employees get paid. I dont want any financial compensation or free food.  All i want to know is after i was handed my take out order. Were you found such a talented employee that can close the take out window and tell me \"FUCK OFF NOW, YOU PIECE OF WHITE FUCKIN TRASH!!\" and slide the window closed at the same time.   I really mean it.   That takes wisdom, practice , and skill to do something like that!!  When the question is answered. You will get a 5 star!!  Sincerly  .... White trash here!!"}
{"text":"Shit service , look at the fucking lettuce in these burgers. This location is a joke , like is it hard to find out how much lettuce is enough for a sandwich. I guess so"}
{"text":"Cleanest McDonald's around Vegas. Excellent staff. Bathrooms always clean and floors and tables. Friendly staff that greets. Food served with a smile. Whenever I work in the area I make sure to stop."}
{"text":"Look, as you can see from other reviews I have written, I'm try not to be a negative person, but hopefully someone will see this and things will get better. I'm not a regular at McDonalds, but while killing time for an airport pickup, I thought I'd swing by as I had just downloaded the app and they had a deal with a McFlurry. I also grabbed another item off the menu, which I did not want sauce on. I tried the touch screen displays to order, but as I was new to it and didn't really want to spend a bunch of time trying to familiarize myself with them right there, I went to the cashier to place my order. I explained that McFlurry deal on the app, no worries, and placed my other item without sauce. I even restated it before I paid. I'm sure you can see where this is going. As I got it to go, I didn't realize that it still had the sauce on it until I had got into my car. I didn't have time to go back in, so I drove away. My suggestion is that with special orders, maybe repeat it when you pick it up at the counter. I'm not sure where the miscommunication was, but I can say I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service! I hate to admit it, but I am addicted to McDonalds Iced Coffee! I frequent this McDonalds everyday as it's on my way home, for a large Ice Coffee.. The customer service is horrible.. It irks me having to wait 20 min & 4 orders later just to get a drink! I've decided it's not worth the hassle anymore & am going to take a break from McDonalds for a while.. I'll save some $ & maybe lose a lil weight in the process.."}
{"text":"They reduced their sizes drastically. The mcflurry is unrecognizable, and for the same price too. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect from McDonald's, but the service was odd. We waited for a waiter for over half-an-hour, with no service. We walked up to the bar, and they thought it was odd that we didn't know the procedures. This differs greatly from the McDonald's I'm used to in Monaco."}
{"text":"It's fast food so don't expect much. Service has always been slow and crappy when I've gone there. Usually only stop there when I get off work at 3am because it's is the only place open really never have what I order, plus th3y are always making me wait and taking other people's orders that have arrived after I did. Bit its fast food."}
{"text":"Fast, accurate and friendly drive thru service!  What more can you ask for?!?  Clearly, management is on the ball, at this new location."}
{"text":"Everybody knows Mcdonalds isn't good for you; but when dollar drink days come every summer, it becomes one of my major food groups (sugar free vanilla ice coffee is gold!) As for this location, it is pretty typical - all Mcdonald's are pretty much the same to me. They could use a bit of a tune up in the inside, but for the most part, service is quick, they're pretty decent with getting the orders right, and a good size inside for dining in.  There isn't a school near-by so it isn't jam packed with children like the Neverland Ranch, which makes it more family friendly and less obnoxious.  But to be straight up, this place is walking distance from my house so to go to any other location farther away, wouldn't happen, so I guess I'm biased. No one wants to admit they eat at a dump."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I've been through the drive thru and inside, both were equally slow. Took 20min one morning to get 2 coffees in the drive thru, and then once was there late at night to get a shake probably a good 10min with not many other ppl there. If your service was faster it'd definitely come by more, would rather drive further to get better and faster service"}
{"text":"I go through the drive-through about once a week to as much as maybe 2 to 3 times a week but I just think that's awesome that Jovita remembers that my coffee needs to be decaf and I only told her one time because I have problems with my heart and now she always makes sure to call back to whoever poured my coffee in the cup to make sure that it's a decaf. Keep up the great customer service Jovita."}
{"text":"They didn't have strawberry cream pies. I had to get a apple pie but deep inside i still wanted a strawberry cream pie FML."}
{"text":"This place is close but many times I've regretted this drive thru. I've often had my coffee with two sugars instead of two creams. For the life of me, I've never had a Tim Horton's mess up my coffee but this place can. I've also gotten someone else's order, or the best is when they ran out of breakfast burrito wraps. I just don't get it; the place is prone to issues.  Sometimes you get the street people in the restaurant so if you aren't into that then be prepared. Also sometimes the drive thru gets jammed up and seems like a parking lot. Not sure why I come here."}
{"text":"This is a regular food court looking McDonalds, nothing snazzy there no McCafe here.   It's convenience for commuters and employees around the area, at night you see all kinds of hobos wander from the Greyhound bus station nearby. It's open late 11pm Mon - Sat. Sun closes at 10pm.    That's about the only reason I would go here."}
{"text":"Employees are professional and friendly. Food is decent and orders are done quickly. The only problem is when the drive thru is busy the cars back up into an area that blocks thru traffic. It can get a little cluster fu##ed."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's ok during the day time, but me and my friends went into this McDonald's at around 2 am. Lots of homeless folks & sketchy looking characters. The fact that there was a security guard made it a bit better (I guess). Bathrooms were filthy, my friend said that there was drugs or some kind of substances in there. I personally didn't eat anything, my friend had a hot chocolate and she said it was fine. Many of the tables had garbage on them, there was no empty seats and the top section was closed for \"cleaning\". Sigh. I don't review places ever, but this just had to be said."}
{"text":"I found the constant changing of the menu to be annoying, but other than that the space was clean and the food was hot.  Good job"}
{"text":"Best coffee on the planet Very very pleasant staff at this location Clean. Hooray! Fast service As with all McDonald's: fries are amazing, so are chicken nuggets, burgers and the ever-so-sweet apple pie"}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION IS CRAP! Last summer (which was the last time I was there), I ordered a large coke. The people behind me ordering full meals, got their food before I got my measley coke. When u ask the employess about it, they give u dirty looks or pretend not to understand u. The employees and managers are always chatting loudly and acting like they are not at a place of work. I will never go to this location again. Next time I want to eat McDicks, I will walk to another location. If you come to this location to get food, guranteed you will leave angry. Avoid this place. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally take the time to review a McDonalds but this one concerns me.   We've gone here a couple of times to grab something quick while out running errands. We usually order chicken snack wraps. The last few times we have, thefood temperature has been a bit concerning. In the same order we've had one that is scorching hot, another that was ice cold - possibly a bit frozen? Also all of them has ridiculous amounts of BBQ sauce pooled at the bottom of the wrap.  Sure the service is fast but don't mess with food safety McD's...especially not with chicken."}
{"text":"Most McDonald's never get my order right but this McDonald's are always on point. Thank you and the employees are so nice!"}
{"text":"Ask for mayonnaise for my fries...  The only fast food location that I've ever been to that charges for mcchicken sauce."}
{"text":"If I could rate this zero stars I would. This place consistently messes up on orders.  It seems like when you ask for sauce they will get yelled at by management for doing so. The management there are obviously are unfit to run a business. Fries are constantly underfilled. I can understand a company trying to manage their product but this location is extremely cheap. If the owners of this location are that strapped for cash maybe opening up a store was a bad idea because it shows big time in the service."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could! This franchise charges more than other McDonald's.... Even the any size drinks are smaller. Cookies are 2 for a buck ... I asked the drive thru guy 3 times what kind of sauces I wanted & he still got it wrong .  The fries were too brown & cold ! One of my Big Macs came with two dry patties & no sauce , no lettuce & not even a complete slice of cheese. I called the manager Virginia to complain & she was rude on the phone. She claimed she boxed all orders & none were wrong.  This is the only time I've been dissatisfied with a McDonald's... this place is just gross."}
{"text":"Eureka!  This is the home of perfect French fries.  Light, tasty, crisp and hot.  Perfectly salted.  Drive-thru service is super-fast, super-polite and there's an order taker with a beautiful and lovely voice just like a melody.  Why, this person should be on the radio, announcing flight times at YYZ, recording books for the blind and making serious mega-bucks doing commercial voice-overs.  Lovely voice.  Fabulous fries.  Go here."}
{"text":"Wi-fi never works, ice cream machine is constantly busted, smells, constant litter. The fact that it's right next to a CASH MONEY is hilarious."}
{"text":"It is one of the nicest looking McDonald's I have gone to. They are able to handle masses of customers smoothly. The best part is that it is open 24 hours. Their fries are always hot."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Rude employees and messy counters. Cold food and they let regular customers cut in front of you and will serve regular customers first. People cut in front of you. Put in a complaint on the internet and said management would contact me. 3 weeks later still have not heard from them. Will never go there again. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Terrible McDonald's. Probably one of the worst in the GTA. They always mess up simple orders - two mcdoubles with no mustard is a challenge - they never have juice in the morning.. Which is a staple of a good breakfast, Just absolutely terrible. Majority of the staff is incompetent. I highly recommend going to the Tim Hortons in the gas station at Dundas and shornecliffe, or if you really want your McDonald's, there's a really good one on islington, just north of queensway."}
{"text":"I was craving a McD's classic: McGangbang (McDouble + McChicken, get your head out of the gutter!). I had no idea they now have all day breakfast, so naturally, I had to add a hashbrown to my McGangbang. I do not regret it, it was glorious. See picture attached."}
{"text":"What people have been waiting for: a 24-hour McDonalds on Green St. This is now open (in place of the old GameStop) as of Fall 2014. The new haven of late night drunk college students, this is a little above your typical McDonalds. Being a new facility, much of it is very nice and clean. It may not stay that way, but as of now it's very nice. The store is also well run in my experience and even late at night when it gets busy, they seem to stay on top of things. You may not want to, but you know you'll end up here eventually."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. Anywhere. I can't believe McDonalds would allow this store to be this bad."}
{"text":"Wow! The only word I can say is : wow! Never been to a McDonald like this before! Staff ..they took orders really slow..and they are RUDE!"}
{"text":"Lets clear some stuff first... I love McDonalds...lol Its cheap and fills the tummy :D  This location here was a bit busy during workday lunch hour. The service is fast and the server and the person putting the food together were friendly and were joking, which was nice. The seating plenty but it is a smaller location.  There is parking on the location and they have free Wifi. They are keeping the food consistent with other MC D's."}
{"text":"Lets clear some stuff first... I love McDonalds...lol Its cheap and fills the tummy :D  Now that's clear lets talk about this location. The location is quite big and has lot of seating. I have used the inside service for take away and sit in,the customer service has been good and quite fast.  The place is designed to be seat and has the cafe side of the look and feal as well."}
{"text":"Last two times here at around 8pm-10 pm. Service sucks. Orders are incomplete and I have to go back for condiments and ask employees for items to complete the order who respond with indifference. In drive thru there are signs that ask you to take receipt surveys in exchange for a coupon.  Of course this is difficult since 3 out of 3 times I have never been offered a receipt!   Tonight , order incomplete as usual. Returned to get condiments. Discovered customers grazing food off the order counter and much to my surprise they were holding a Bishon doggie who was not wearing any identifying I'd as to beeping an assist dog. Most impressive was how the two ladies with the dog were leaning in close over the counter where food is served. Once thier order was complete they stopped eating over the order counter and went back into the restaurant to be seated with thier furry friend.  Restaurant counter walls laden with wrappers, receipts. Lobby floors had spills that went unattended. Lobby filed with teens who are employees just off of work and thier friends hanging out by two tables near front door. Staff to busy entertaining get friends to serve adult guest.   On cleanliness,  did not visit bathrooms or other parts of lobby for fear of what I might find.   Pictured added to restaurants profile for your viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"What can you really say about a hamburger chain that's been around for decades ?  remember when Big Macs were $1.10 each. Quarter pound  cheeseburger's weren't much more. Whenever I think of Quarters Pounders, I think of the line made famous by John Travolta in Pulp Fiction. Attached is a You Tube Video clip of that scene. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLtwFugudZE If you have kids, you probably eat  here more often then you really care to.   Firstly I'll write about what I like about Mickey D's. (Besides the items served ALL THE TIME).  - $1.00 drinks all summer deal.  - Shamrock shakes (St.Patrick's Day ) - ???  Things that have come and gone. - Pizza's - Rib sandwich - Mc dlt -??? Someone once told me that whatever McDonald's sold they were the largest at it. ie: Pizza, they're now the largest pizza chain, (coffee), now the largest coffee chain?? etc.  Secondly, here are areas I think they can improve on.  - getting your order right (especially drive through). Almost 5 out of 7 times want take away, they get something wrong on your order.  - some of the time  your order isn't as hot as it should be.  *** TIP***    If they mess up your order, and your already half way home. Call the store (number on receipt). Talk to the manager,they will take your name and number, and comp your next meal.   I'm sure everyone had things they like or dislike about McDonald's, but it isn't going anywhere anytime soon.   World Wide McDonald's serves 69 billion people each year, and an operating income of 8.6 billion last year !"}
{"text":"The food is always warm, fresh,and well-cooked, which is great for a fast food place. They're usually out of seating, though, especially around lunchtime, so expect to have to eat your food outside or squeezed in between two strangers. I've never seen them get an order wrong, and the staff are always polite, but they do seem to run out of ketchup a lot. Their peppermint hot chocolate is amazing, and the cups keep it warm a loooong time."}
{"text":"This McDonald's just opened back in December, so it's the newest and cleanest one downtown.  It's set up a little more high-end than most of the typical McDonald's; you can refill your own pop (yay!), there are front row seats to watch the street theatre on Yonge at night, and the staff seems to like working there and were friendly (to me anyway).  It also has two levels but I haven't gone upstairs yet.  I don't know about anyone else, but I'd rather spend $1.39 on a cone here than go to one of those foo-foo yoghurt places and pay 8 bucks for the same thing.  But that's just me."}
{"text":"Love this new McDonald's location! It's minutes from my work and easy access to main highway. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a staff member. He was informing me about the their new Asian Salad menu. The decent spread of selections make it difficult to order. And the dollar menu and sweet treats are the bargains! McDonald's never gives me a hassle when I ask for a fresh batch of their famous fries. I'm loving it! LOL!   McDonald's has gone a long way improving their menu for more grills, greens and smoothies. So, no more blaming game that fast food chain restaurants causes obesity for both childhood and adults! Haha!  The modern decor, big open space, and nice LCD menu boards make this location an awesome pick!  The staff is great and service is above average compare to other McDonald's around town. Hope you have the same experience! :)"}
{"text":"This McDonalds messes up your order ALL THE TIME. My last visit a couple of weeks ago... the order took over 10 minutes (and I was the only one in line) and I got a burned hamburger that I didn't know was burned till I got home. And the hamburger was the ONLY thing I ordered. I asked for ketchup and they told me they were out. I called the customer service number on their window and left a message. No one ever got back to me."}
{"text":"This is not closed but horribly slow!!!!!!!! Ridiculous!!!  People are literally driving over curbs to get out of the drive thru!!"}
{"text":"Depending on the staff that's working, it could be a not so bad experience. On many occasions my wife and I have left with the wrong order or missing items. There are a few workers there that are nice and friendly, but most of them are just mean and unhappy working there. One time when we were in the drive through, we saw a worker ask another worker if the cup she was holding was sweet tea. When the second worker said she didn't know, the first worker opened the lid and took a sip of it... My wife was furious. She asked if our drinks had the same treatment, the second worker smugly said no with a half smile. Now we usually go to the Mcdonalds up the road a couple miles. It's farther but the service is so much better."}
{"text":"Brutal customer service by order taker at drive through. No manners and waited before she took order. Waited again at window before she opened it to deliver order.  2/21/17.....my bad for returning, needed a coffee. Still brutal service...."}
{"text":"The Mcdonalds on highway 50 in Brampton is terrible. The lines are terribly long in drive thru ALWAYS. The service is slow and the food is always stale. I hate going here but it is the closest location to my home."}
{"text":"Worst experience today. You would think that a McDonald inside a Walmart would be the same as any other franchise but NO! There customer service is slow and the shift manager some gal without a name badge was very rude and may need to go to customer service training 101. I hope that upper management reads this review and reevaluate their process for customer service. I will continue to shop at the Walmart but not the McDonald."}
{"text":"Wow the service was slow. There was only 3 people in line and it took 15 mins.  However I think the order taker was in training. She was friendly...I give her that.  My Fillet-O-Fish was so limp that it looked like it was stepped on.  Blah."}
{"text":"This McDonalds has a great location and the kitchen staff in the back is good. The problem is the young man running the counter.  I don't know if the young guy behind the counter is ageist or racist or what but if your older and are not Mexican, he counts how many refills you have and then tells you \"You've had your refill and we only give one! Please pay $2 if you want another refill.\" The first time this happens I queried the policy with the GM and was told yes this is correct and it is displayed by the fountain. I asked where as there is NO sign anywhere about a refill policy. The GM walked me all over the store before admiring there was no sign but the policy stands. So I go continue eating. During the time it takes for me to finish my meal I see other people, young Mexicans, go to the counter and get refills twice from the same young man with no issue and didn't have to pay anything.   I've been to this store multiple times now and have seen this happen every time that young man is running the till.  My last visit was what I consider the last straw. I bought 2 coffees one for my mom and one for me. After my mom got her one refill I was told that I couldn't refill my coffee because she'd already had her refill. And I had 2 Long hairs in my egg mcmuffins that they did nothing about it.  If the franchise owner reads this I'd suggest reviewing your surveillance and take action on this. If your policy is one refill, it should be enforced to everybody or not enforced at all.  Also Roberto the GM couldn't care less about the customers . When I asked to speak to him he was very rude and flippant with my complaint and told me \"Go ahead and call here's my store number and name, I don't care\" when I told him I was going to complain about the issue with McDs corporate office."}
{"text":"Has got to be the worst McDonald's in the city. Slow, inefficient, incompetent, rude, lazy, etc...   Expect to see things like: You got 2 women standing by the cash register just talking (when nobody is in line), meanwhile one of them could be making your coffee. Brutal!"}
{"text":"This has to be possibly the worst store I have ever been to. I went there 9/30/14 at 5:05 am. I ordered the #2 breakfast meal and four breakfast burritos. I thought it was a simple order, but I waited for 10 min in the wait spots. I walked back in to find no one at the counter. I waited and finally a lady (mgr) told me they were running late on the burritos. I asked for my money back at 5:17am. At 5:17 they still do not have any burritos? This  store opens at 5am and they are not ready at 5am? This has happened to me on several occasions. I went to the one on Val vista and pecos today, and was on my way in no time."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has a lot of service problems.  Orders are inaccurate (drive-up especially), service is slow, and management does not care.  I've submitted repeated feedback via their corporate website - nothing has changed.  Latest incident was on 12/14/2017 at 6:45am in the drive-up.  I was ignored in the outside lane while several other customers in the inside lane gave their orders.  I just drove to the only open window and complained that no one took my order.  The female manager on duty was near the window so I advised her of my experience and she said, \"I apologize but we only have 1 person taking orders - we're short-handed\" and she walked off.  Well that's not my problem.  If you don't want my business, place a sign up at the drive-through that advises us.  Management simply does not care, so this attitude is conveyed to the workers.  I feel sorry for the workers.  Sorry McDonald's on S Higley Rd - I finally give up!"}
{"text":"McDonald's without wifi.  What year is this?  Total fail.  Second, this location needs to improve the way it organizes its line ups too.  When busy, people are confused and jumping the line.  Chaos and anger galore."}
{"text":"Best service ever!!!!! The mixed girl with the curly hair did so good serving my food. i wish more of the employees looked as good as her to be honest didnt even come here for the food i came here for her. i walked in and was like daaaaamn!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the worst experience for breakfast of any MacDonalds we have ever been in North America  - we had the McMuffin sausage and egg combo the buns were burned and the sausage dry the coffee was too hot to drink and the hash brown tasted like it was cooked in OLD  oil as it tasted rank. The lady fetching the coffee was the slowest person I have ever experienced in a fast food place - sorry but she was out of her element. I'm giving it one star because I was able to scan the local paper as I chocked down on the mess - I was hungry but not satisfied."}
{"text":"I'v been coming to this location for over 15 years. I won't even bother rating the food but it's the same. When you get a craving for fries or a mcchciken you come here, when it's late at night and ur drunk u come here (dd is driving of course). Even if ur on a diet and u wanna fall off the wagon u come here.   This is the slowest line moving line ever !!!! You will be waiting for ages inside and especially outside in the drive thru. I see people leaving the line all the time.   They recently renovated and upgraded to the self order computerized menus. Technology is great and sure we are moving forward in the future. But has this made ordering and eating any faster ??? No it hasn't!!! It will take time, ppl are confused but that's a separate issue.   Ps: the parking lot is tiny."}
{"text":"How do you serve the wrong thing when the name is literally on the wrapping? I asked for a McGriddle and they served me some biscuit. If I didn't have a sick crying baby I probably would have returned. Seriously, attention to detail guys."}
{"text":"Pulled up to drive through and ordered a double cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles. Asked them to be sure ketchup and pickles only. Went to the first window to pay and I asked again to be sure it was ketchup and pickles only. Again the response was yes. Went to the next window to get the order, asked the same question about ketchup and pickles and the response was yes. Drove away, opened the package took a big bite and guess what.... ketchup and mustard only. Just about gagged (as I have an allergy to mustard) drove back to the store, and the managers response was \"well it happens\". Good thing I did not go belly-up. Tried to get me to pay for another dbl cheese burger. Made a scene and walked out. No communication at this location."}
{"text":"Seriously, I have say this all the time, this is the THE best run McDonalds in America. Food comes out quick and quality. People working there are focused and nice, unlike the majority of most McDonalds I have been to."}
{"text":"The newest McDonald's on Yonge Street. Had the touch screen kiosks, a Mccafe and a large upstairs seating area. A bit nicer than the two McDonald's father up Yonge which I also frequent... sigh."}
{"text":"I've never seen 50 pieces of chicken mcnuggets for only $9.99.  We had to look a few times at their board to confirm that our vision was working.  This is the most affordable place to eat at the MGM, therefore the long, long lines in the AM for breakfast.  Prices are consistent with what they charge on the outside but they'll slap on an additional 50 cents for any sustitutions.  An egg mcmuffin is $2.90 and a sausage mcmuffin $1.41, add the egg = $2.90.  Probably the cheapest meal you'll be able to get at this hotel."}
{"text":"McDonalds it okay for burger sometimes, but it is not for all the times, because it is more expensive than other fast food like Burger King or In N Out! By the way they only good for breakfast stuffs, I only recommend for morning and not lunches or dinners! For those whom loved fast food!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times to grab breakfast in the drive-thru. Nothing unusual about a weekend morning rush of hungover people. Pretty consistent wait time for each visit. Food and coffee was as expected.   Service has always been good. Order has always been correct and the people working the windows have always been pleasant.  It's the closest one to my home, so damn right I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a MacDonald's in a food court. Its close to the bus station, a fit for life and a Subway. It has decently fast service , though sometimes a big lineup at breakfast. The food court here is a bit eclectic and has some scuzzy elements as well as office workers taking their lunch."}
{"text":"Surprisingly one of the most consistent and well-organized restaurants in the area. Food is always hot, fries are always crispy. Cashiers are usually pretty friendly. They have one of those screens that display whether your order is ready, though it's not always working. I haven't had a order go wrong yet. I come here a lot when I need to save money on food. There are a few regular characters who are fun to see, like the Asian guy who brings in a stereo to blast R&B on and flirts with every girl who walks in.  Tips: 1) The 2 for $3 deals tend to go on for a while after the ad is taken down, and those are probably the best value on the menu.  2) Don't get 10pc chicken nuggets. Multiple orders of 4pc chicken nuggets cost the least per nugget (a quarter each; same as 20pc) and have the greatest sauce-to-nugget ratio (1 pack for 4 nuggets; 10pc is 1:5 and 20pc is 1:6.67).  3) There's a secret extra-large drink size that is cheaper than all the regular sizes (~$1?).  4) Bring cash when it's around 4am. It appears to be when all the machines reboot and they can't take card. One star off because they don't actually tell you about this and I've had to wait in line to find out I can't order anything."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. Yeah I get that it's McDonald's and I don't expect the best service but I expect decent service. My first experience was sitting in the drive thru for 15 plus minutes. That was my mistake because I was in a hurry that night. It took me 15 minutes just to get up to the window. It then took another few minutes to get my food because they didn't know what my order was. The manager, Colleen, was running the drive thru. I'm usually not the person to complain for crappy service sometimes. I have worked in the food service industry before, I get it. But this confusion of them not even have my order ready when I got up to the window was insane. Especially when I had already waited for 15 minutes when there weren't that many cars ahead of me. In the confusion of it all the manager didn't even give me my drink! I had to go back through the drive through just to get my drink and she then decided to offer up a free meal next time. I thought okay yeah thanks for trying to help.   Now let's fast forward to tonight. I decide to get my free meal. It's 915 and I'm waiting to be taken car of at front. I hear Colleen and another girl complaint about work problems. Colleen makes eye contact with me twice. TWICE. The girl at drive thru makes eye contact with me. A guy sweeping the floor makes eye contact with me also. No one says a word to me. About 5 to 10 minutes go by without a single word muttered to me. I hear a lady ask if I've been taken care of in the front and I yell no. And then I hear the lady say oh we don't even have registers open up front. Here's my question, if the lobby is still open why take out the tills and close the registers??? The girl at the drive thru takes my order and I get it for free like Colleen had told me prior. Also at the end of the order I say \"thank you for helping me but I would have appreciated it if you had told me the registers were closed so I could have gone through the drive thru instead of knowing I was standing there and completely ignoring me.\" And the only response that she gave me was that there are signs out front. She took me outside to look at the signs and lo and behold there are absolutely no signs. I told her apparently I'm not the only one because there were 4 more people behind me in line. She then gives me the excuse that kids steal their signs and have called the police on them. Okay? Great. That's not my problem.   What I do have a problem with is that instead of her handling it like a manager should have she completely passed the blame on kids who supposedly steal their signs where there are absolutely no signs anywhere! Not even an hours sign on the door. Management sucks. They do not care about the customers what so ever!! Orders are also mostly wrong. DO NOT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Parking I really do not recommend coming here on a weekend.  You do know that they share a parking lot with the Chinese grocery store right?  It's crazy here!  Weekdays, that's fine.  One time, while walking to my car, a bunch of teenage boys drove by and flipped my drink.  I tried chasing after them, and I only heard them yelling racist remarks while driving away.  A little crazy, hope it doesn't happen to you.  Food/Service What can I say...your typical McD's.  I don't think service was slow, and the staff were quite friendly.  I think it's no different from any other McD's, just that it's situated in a super busy location."}
{"text":"I'd imagine it's great during the day, but we stopped in at 11pm on a Tuesday night and it was overrun by teenagers and homeless folks. Half the self-service kiosks were out of order, and there wasn't an empty table in the place. Food was fine, but got to sit by the line from the restroom and watch a security guard escort someone out. Entertaining, I suppose, but I'd recommend somewhere less chaotic for a late night snack."}
{"text":"I placed an order I got home it was wrong. Missing 10 nuggets in order.  Has an upset family so i took the entire wrong order back asked for new food since the food I received would be extra cold by the time I got home.   The manager said no problem. I get hone and the 10 nuggets were hot and fresh and fries were.  The sandwich and the other 10 nuggets cold as ice.  I had to go out again to another McDonalds and pay more money for the food that was cold.    I am upset that the staff lied to me."}
{"text":"bababababa im lovin it ayyy lamo"}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to!!!  And that is saying something.  The food is generally cold, dried out, and stale. Every so often we are lucky enough to get good food, but not generally.     The service is deplorable.  Tonight my husband went inside and ordered five meals.  Every kids meal was missing the milk AND the sauce for the chicken nuggets.  Every one.  And the medium milkshake ordered was delivered as a small.  Ridiculous!  It was a take out order, so there was no point in going back and rectifying the order.  Just deplorable.  This franchise is in desperate need of help in both food preparation, service, organization and attitude."}
{"text":"Nasty super salty over and under cooked food.. they don't care they just want to collect your money and serve someone else.. would give it a ZERO review if I could.. this place should be shut down"}
{"text":"The location is very clean compared to most. Staffs are friendly, efficient and professional. The manager or supervisor was superb. He made sure we received our compete order. I had neglected to request my sandwich without mayo. It was replaced without hesitation and was delivered to our table. He even came around making sure patrons were well taken care of. A very pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"The food is what it is but that Friggin Alarm is loud and seems management don't care"}
{"text":"As with all McDonald's, I don't like how they don't serve lunch before 11am. I don't like their breakfast items, so I will probably not return here."}
{"text":"On the scale of McD's this one is pretty fancy. As a non McD's person and a  non coffee drinker; I found the two serving stations confusing. As a customer I want the shortest line to get in and get out. I lined up to the right to find out that was beverages ie: coffee and pasteries only. Hence the fancy pants McD's!!   So then I go and line up in the other line and happen to mention that maybe they should put a sign up there stating beverages only, so people like me will line up in the right place. She snippedly retorted: it says McCafe! I replied: and that means what to me?   Obviously McD's has revamped their branding and image. Good for them. But for someone like me who comes in here maybe twice a year. Whoopie! I want in and out. Have signs up so I know where to go, to get what I want.  Food wise. It's McD's. No surprises there."}
{"text":"If I could give this dump NO STARS I would! They open at 6... Sometimes. The food is consistently cold and/ or old. They run out of stuff too. You're having a sale on chicken McNuggets- HOW THE F DO YOU RUN OUT OF MCNUGGETS! They run out of the sauces a lot too. This is quite possibly the worst McDonald's on the planet. How the manager stays in a job is beyond me. Go to Dave's across the street and get a breakfast Hot Pocket. You'll be better off."}
{"text":"The WORST McDonalds I have ever visted, hands down! I have visited the place three time, after the first time I said I would never go back. I would be out and about and the kids would say \"Dad can we stop by McDonalds\"  against me better judgement I stop. To make a long story short my experiences where HORRIBLE! I have experienced the person at the window on their cell phone talking while I had to wait to place an order, and when I get to the pick up window my order was WRONG! On another occasion while coming through the drive thur, the order taker had a very BAD ATTITUDE. I asked her if she was having a bad day and with the same attitude I got while ordering , she said \"Naw is you having a bad day?\"  After I paid and pulled forward to pick up my meal , the manager was at the window and asked, how are things going. I told him good except for the attitude i just got at the first window, he looked to see who was working at the window then passed me my order and closed the window. This place is the worst, go there if you want to experience bad service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite McDonald's location. The workers are always so friendly and the food is fresh. This is the only one I try to go to. My kids also love the workers here."}
{"text":"One of the worst McDonald's in the area. Staff here are Rude and completely apparent that they hate the location as much as I do. Most places wouldn't really care and switch out a happy meal toy for me; but this place really made it a big deal. WOW! Not wearing any gloves and talking over my food!! Completely disgusting!! When I made a complaint about it they the ones that seemed disgusted. REALLY!! WOW#2 I actually saw staff outside smoking......not cigarettes!!!! It looked like a scene from the movie Clerks!  Look im from NY and not even my hood was this ghetto. REAL TALK!! I could imagine what goes on behind the scenes if it looked like this in plain sight."}
{"text":"Seriously, how hard is it to make a medium coffee double double? You got my order wrong again. I asked you to do one thing, its not that hard ya know, one thing and you still got it wrong, its just a drink, nothing too mind boggling as far as i can see. Here is the recipe for my coffee. Put the cup under the dispenser, Push the button twice for cream, push the button twice for sugar, add coffee. Voila, you're done! Put a lid on that sucker and pass it thought the window. You got it wrong.  there was no sugar.   You suck 1 star because i cant give you zero"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I would probably consider it THE Yonge/Dundas area-ISH McD's.  Ya this is a tourist area but it's also a busy area too considering it's the Ryerson default McD's too.    That being said imagine how long the lines can be at a place where food competition in fierce and you are the restaurant with the most famous name in the world to live up to... in the heart of the biggest city in the country... ?    Try to wrap your head around the expectations for this one single McD's restaurant?  It's the Canadian equivalent of the McD's in Times Square or 42nd street or Piccadilly Circus?  You get the idea, right?  What sets this particular place apart are a few things I noticed.  Ya, ya the touch display they've had that for months before all the other locations got them sure.  They have 2 separate counters for regular food items and McCafe has its own!  By our standards that's huge.  The new format with 2 tills and now serving number X is the new thing in all places so not unique here either.  Some of the seating has phone chargers with cables already whether micro USB or Apple proprietary Thunderbolt interface.  I wasn't really impressed with that because the 2 within reach one didn't work and the other had a completely broken plug.  Besides that it's one of the more nicer and modern looking McD's.  It's not anywhere near perfect but it's better than most I'd say."}
{"text":"This location is nice and clean. But they got my order wrong not 2 but 3 times. I don't know it was like zombies were working there. Anyway I left. Never coming back to this location ever!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and I'm never going back.   First time I didn't even order and just walked out because the line up was too long and didn't seem to be moving. Sorry, I'm not waiting 10 minutes for a damn Big Mac. Then the other night it's late, I'm coming home and decide to grab something along the way.   The order was fast enough, considering I was the only person around at the drive through, but I didn't get a receipt which I didn't think of at the time. Then when I did get my food the fries were cold and the burger was lukewarm. Not happy but without a receipt there's little I can do when complaining. Good thing these things exist so I can write my displeasure for others to see.   Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"I can't express how nasty this mcdonald is! Its the only thing closes to my house and they just take forever with their food! The service is crap, like they do not have any customer service skills! Even if they are working at a crappy job, doesn't give them the right to throw attitudes to their customer!"}
{"text":"This location has extremely slow service, the fries are always over salted, coffees are made inconsistently, and you are guaranteed to receive at least one item in your order wrong!"}
{"text":"I like to come to this place when I need a cheep and undigestable peice of plastic to keep my stomach quiet. If you have been to one Mc Donalds then you have been to them all realy.  Some of the things that set it apart is that the neighbourhood lacks people mixing hard liquor in their soft drinks and is situated next to a lovely river that is great to watch durring spawning season. The drive through is on one heck of a steep slope, I would recomend that those with manual cars steer clear."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab my kiddos a snack and to play for a bit in the kids play area. The problem is they are always, always, always out of ice cream or their ice cream machine is broken!"}
{"text":"My regular rating for McDonald's (3 stars), except the parking really sucks here! That's why I took off another star lol food is like all mcDs."}
{"text":"They stay open until late everyday so its practical when graving for an Ice Coffee :p"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is on the commercial strip of Dundas west of Kipling station and east of the 427 on the south side.   It's small in a sense I've seen McDonald's inside Walmarts larger than this particular store.   I've been to many, many  McDonald's in my time across the continent from highway stops to inner city locations from coast to coast and out of the dozens or even hundreds I've been to in my life this location is probably the slowest I've ever experienced. They are slower than the one near the marina in Monterrey, California - yes that slow where I was felt to be like I was in In-N-Out with a receipt in queue back when they didn't serve that way like they do now.   No this place wasn't a long wait because of volume of lack of staff perceivably but rather just all around competence.   Somebody from the back came to front to say he ticket printing machine wasn't working and somebody said to add paper.    The drive through was being handled by one person and the front counter by another. The person looking after the front counter didn't seem very trained. There were only 2 people in front of me and it was about 7:40 am when I got there. I waited in line until maybe 7:48 before ordering.  I had to repeat my order 3 times because the person looking after me had trouble punching in my order which was only a number 2 breakfast combo which included a coffee with 2 milk.  I had a mailer coupon and she didn't know how to enter it and asked me again what it was I ordered. After getting help from the person looking after the drive through the order was finally entered and she had asked for the money which was right in front of her when I had originally ordered an handed over the coupon and money.   So about 15 minutes have passed by. There was only 2 people originally in front of me when I finally ordered and now it's almost 8am. So to my best estimation it took  between 15 to 18 minutes to get breakfast with 2 people ahead of me.   Oh and when I left and opened my bag at the place I had my morning appointment I was given the wrong sandwich. At least I didn't have sugar in my coffee.   While I admit I'm not the most patient person but I'm can say I'm understanding to a point. I can't think of many fast food places that aren't as busy where it would take close to 20 minutes to get your breakfast during normal circumstances.   It certainly doesn't help when staff doesn't seem fully trained and they end up giving the wrong orders away.   I'm sorry to say this place needs to evaluate how they serve because more than 5 minutes per customer to me is unacceptable these days especially when you are a McDonald's where the expectations are pretty standard and the level of service is also expected to be at a certain level (like all the rest)."}
{"text":"Drive through experience was a nightmare!  Order a big Mac meal. I ordered a meal and was asked if I wanted medium or large. I told them I wanted medium fries and large drink. I was told I couldn't do that. Even though I was told that the cost of the medium and large drinks were the same price, I couldn't do it. Thought I was being \"punked\". In order to get a large drink I had to order my meal large and get large fries. The attendant was rude and sarcastic. I backed out of the drive through to leave, but not before he tells me \"see you tomorrow morning\". I don't know where that came from?  I have placed this type of request at three other McDonald's before, along with this restaurant too. Each one has given me the order the way I wanted it.  I called to speak to the manager - he was useless. He said that was policy."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would so do it for this place. I have been going to this McDonald's as long as I can remember probably as long as it's been there!!! My thing is that now since they became more modernized, they really aren't keeping up like they make everyone think. First of all I had three back to back episodes of just straight BS.  1. Went to drive through and ordered my food asked if they accepted Apple Pay. They acted like I was speaking an unknown language so I just asked again at the window. They say oh the machine is down right now....ok I get it and paid with my debit card.   2. Called before hand this time to see if the machine was working for Apple Pay....they lady said yes it's working. Cool on my way. Ordered my food get to window and the guys says he can't grab my phone to put it up to the machine for the reader to scan it. Wow!!! Really!!! Taco Bell, Burger King and Starbucks all take your phone from you and hand it back. He said I will be held responsible if I drop it, I said then don't drop it in between me handing it to you and to the register and back.  No ma'am I can't. Whatever I paid again with my card.   3. This is the real fun time.  Sorry it's so long but I had to explain in detail!!!!!!!I call first to see if Apple Pay was working and also stated that unneeded to use it through the drive thru, they say oh yeah it's working and that's fine to pay with Apple Pay in the drive through. Cool here I go again like a idiot. I order my food and explain that I have coupons on my app and would like to use them. Ok fine they say just show your phone at the window. Get to the window (keep in mind I have used more than one coupon at a time here since the app came out) I said here is the coupon for buy one get one free McFlurry's. He grabbed my phone (hmmmmm thought you couldn't do that. Then I say I have one more for the buy a sandwich get another free, he still has my phone and has no idea what he is doing so I say what's up? Our system only scans one coupon per visit. Nope just did it last week. Whatever not gonna argue with you, ok can you scan my Apple Pay now? The look I got was priceless. I have no idea what you are talking about what is Apple Pay? Really get me a manager please. Manager comes while still having my phone in their possession they did not once hand my phone back, manager says oh you have to come in to use Apple Pay. Then why didn't you tell me that the first or second time I came here. Whatever go inside to pay just to find out they charges me for both Mcflurry's. I said he scanned my coupon at the drive thru window why am I charged for both. Oh it didn't process. Ok then go ahead and refund me one of the mcflurry's and I won't be back here again. We can't refund it to Apple Pay. Get the hell out of here. You need to just give me the cash then. We can't do that either. So what ur saying is I'm out the money you just charged me without my consent. I need someone above the manager. She called someone on the phone and after arguing with me and getting an additude with me ended up opening the register and giving me cash back!!!!! Then they give me mcflurry's that we're melted from sitting so long while they get their act together. Not in the mood to continue and not worth my time. I'll freeze them when I get home damn!!!! I absolutely will not ever go here again after all these years. Idiots. FYI you need to train your employees on how to operate every piece of technology you use so they don't have to look so stupid when you ask them a question about it. Ridiculous!!!!!"}

{"text":"How do you run out of hot cakes at McDonald's? 25 minute wait after self ordering in their new kiosk and they run out of food?     Parking is crazy , nothing good to say other than the owners are making good money off pre made fast food."}
{"text":"Ok, well as I have said before, when reviewing a world wide chain restaurant talking about the food in a review is not necessarily helpful as most of us are aware of the fare offered. Having said that if there are quality issues, I definitely would make note of it in the review.   So that said..... this McDonalds is conveniently located in the deerfoot meadows complex.  What I like about this Mc D is that it is newish  and the decor inside is more hip. There is a working fireplace and 2 nice pleather chairs to sit in by the fire. In addition they have a nice clean dining room as well as seating along the front window. Sometimes I love to sit along those cafeteria seats and people watch.  The food? Well its McDonalds.... no comment... a guilty pleasure sometimes..... the service is decent, the dining room is clean and there is plenty of parking... Im lovin it."}
{"text":"This USED to be the bottom of the pit for a Mickey D's.....It looks like they cleaned up their house a bit and hired some folks who actually 1) know how to do their job and 2) are friendly. Really can't ask for more than that at a McD's.  I needed to grab a quick bite before a workout, and yes, you CAN actually get something half-way healthy at McD's....just skip the fries and coke and order a grilled chicken with NO mayo! Ask for extra tomatoes and onions and that makes it more jiucy.....and add mustard too.  The gal who took my money was SOOOOOO sweet! Guess that made them earn my 3 stars today. It is convenient to my house, but I've had some horrific experiences here....This time, 3 stars.  Out."}
{"text":"Agree with other review I will never go back Waited 3-4 minutes to order- drive thru should have known better one car backed out as I got there Only one car ahead when I ordered but two when I went to pay. I waited TEN minutes after I ordered for a double filet of fish when I got to window server asked what I ordered? After ten minutes I could hear her asking the cook where my order was Reply it's right there you need new glasses, when I told her it's ridiculous she just waved her hand and tried to close the window Imagine when I got home single filet in a double box!. Called manager Dave? Asked if I wanted to come back LOL Didn't even offer to make good later I will call Head Office tomorrow manager didn't seem too concearned I only passed eight fast food restaurants before Islington So Macdonald your not the only game on Dundas St west A LOST CUSTOMER"}
{"text":"Service was quick & staff was friendly. Tables were dirty while you navigated around the homeless people to the soda station."}
{"text":"Everytime I order coffee, it is NEVER right. I should've gone to the Tim Hortons across even thought they're busy my coffee is always made right. I think this McDonald's location should start looking into proper calibrations of their sugar, cream and milk machine if they have. It's disappointing."}
{"text":"This location is so nice and clean the staff are soooo friendly !!!!! My favorite McDonald's"}
{"text":"Went there the other day and waited 15 minutes for my Big Mac. The managers have no control what so ever as the employees were all screaming and swearing that they didn't want to be there.  NEVER again"}
{"text":"They are super slow and rude. I've twice waited for a simple coffee and a simple iced coffee. With the coffee I waited for 7 minutes and with the iced coffee they never helped me at the drive thru then made me wait another 10 minutes for the iced coffee. Avoid this location and go to the Walmart location instead. Next!"}
{"text":"It's McDonalds. In a pinch, nothing can be beat. You know what you're getting, of course (potentially carcinogenic burgers, high rates of saturated fat, and spotty service). But don't let that dissuade you from coming here. Like another reviewer wrote, of the McDonalds in the area, this might just be one of the best. It's generally clean, organized, and usually friendly. During the semester, particularly late nights, it'll take you forever to get your order. But aside from those times, everything's pretty tip top. I don't order much here anymore, but I'm a regular when it comes to the $1 drinks. Those are always nice!"}
{"text":"I've never had any problems.  They do get busy, but it's a fast food restaurant, so maybe my expectations are low, but I really have never had anything to complain about.  I saw all the one and two star reviews so I thought it would be nice for them to know it's not that bad.  The employees appear to be hard workers and have always been kind to me and served me with a smile.  At the end of the day, give it a chance, it Isn't that horrible!"}
{"text":"The Manager works real hard to cover the mistakes of the staff!  She needs help. Head office should take more interest in this location."}
{"text":"I live right by this McDonald's... Always go there but tonight I sat in the drive thru with my family whom we all only ordered one meal each. We waited in the drive thru window for almost 30 minutes.. cars were lining up .. the vehicle behind mine actually got out to find out the issue..  There was a man who walked around inside several times but never once stopped to let us know why it was taking longer then normal..  After my boyfriend knocked on the window, the man inside proceeded to walk in no such hurry to open it.. as I asked \"hi is everything okay did you forget about us\"? And he looked at us and said \"we had a 20 burger order inside sorry we will be right with you.  And closed the window.  And inside this is what our nuggets looked like .."}
{"text":"Give me in the drive-through repeatedly. And then just sat there waiting for them to take my order like they didn't see me or something?  I think I was in the line at 10:00. But this McDonald definitely needs to get it together because I order the same guacamole sandwich that they have and half the time they forget the lime .and one time I actually had to wait in the receiving dock for a slice of lime. I waited I was like this is a joke right. If you weren't so close to my home I probably just go to another McDonald's"}
{"text":"McDonald's - one of the initial franchise empires to pave the way for every other company out there. Normally I stay clear from McDonald's because they don't seem too healthy but who am I to argue with all these new commercial campaigns they have about saying their food is fresh...... This particular McDonald's is new so it's very inviting and clean. I haven't had the pleasure of trying it out for myself but my daughter ensures me that the playground is good to go. Far away from civilization, this McDonald's has a double drive-through so either they're expecting a major boom out this way or there's some serious McDonald's lovers close by & they wanna be ready for anything.   The other day I tried to order some chicken strips and found out that McDonalds discontinued them. I was pretty devastated considering I feel they are somewhat healthy amongst the wide variety of potentially fatty carnage. Not to say that they are, but after years of having negativity drilled in your head about the unhealthiness of these fine establishments, you tend to start believing it. Feeling doomed for all eternity, I was recommended to try the new breaded chicken wings aka mighty wings. Low and behold, these meaty bite-size morsels hit the spot. They have a little bit of a flair to them as well! I like them so much that I forgot about the dipping sauces.   Hopefully the price comes down a bit because I can see myself ordering these from time to time. However, for a dozen wings I think it's a bit much. They might as well off for a bucket of 20 - 30 like their McNuggets or those chicken competitors."}
{"text":"Pros: 1) Good location in between Dundas and College. 2) Speedy service. 3) Kiosks.  Cons: 1) Sketchy degenerates' place of congregation. This is the type of place where ppl get stabbed. 2) Dirty - Especially the washrooms. 3) Self-serve fountain drink machine with the orange frutopia was out of service."}
{"text":"We utilize the drive thru a lot because we kind of figure SURELY they will improve at some point, right?  If you check your order before driving away, you should be fine.  Not checking my order before pulling away has bit me in the bootie a few times. (We made it home one night and literally half of our large order was missing)  Now I am sure to check and it seems to work.  I do find that they miss something out of the order more times than they don't and I would be a bit more impressed if they acknowledged it.   I went there at 11:45 this last Friday night and they were out of iced tea, Sprite, and Diet Coke.  When I said \"Really, you're out of all 3!?\" the girl at the window was quite tart when she replied \"Well, it IS the end of the day!\".  Um, don't think so."}
{"text":"I don't usually review fast food places. You show up and pretty much know what your going to get.   This particular location is the exception to that rule.   I live really close by so it's a very convenient location. So I end up frequenting it more than they deserve. In my experience, I'd say they have about a 20% success rate on getting the correct order into the bag. Order a Sausage McMuffin, get a Sausage Biscuit, order a plain Cheeseburger and get all the toppings, order McNuggets with BBQ sauce and get no sauce and so on and on and on. Unfortunately I don't usually discover their errors until I get home. By then I'm to lazy to go back.   In the future and I think I need to drive a bit further and hit the Mickey D's on 91st and Olive."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. I've been here countless times as it is my local McDonald's - you are more likely to have mistakes in your order than not and you usually wait 10-15 mins for something as simple as a cheeseburger. They are often out of ingredients, from as small as honey to as big as a Big Mac itself. At night-early AM the service is terrible, rude and incompetent employees abound."}
{"text":"Bad customer service they don't check the bags before they give them to you and forget half your order..... new drive thru only plus...."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst McDonald's in all of Canada. Very very slow unorganized they make all kinds of mistakes and very rude"}
{"text":"Another McDonald's in my area that has to be the WORST service I ever received. There were only 2 people in front of me and I waited about 8 minutes before they took my order. Wasn't a good start. I finally ordered two McFlurry's.  It took her about 5 minutes to prepare the first McFlurry and then I was waiting for the second one I ordered.  Since I was waiting there with the McFlurry for about 2 minutes, I figured she forgot about the second McFlurry. I said \"excuse me, I ordered 2 McFlurry's and I'm waiting on the second one. Do you know how long that will take?\".  The McDonald's employee looked at me and said, we are out of cups and she is getting them from the back (meanwhile, there were a ton of stacked cups behind her - not sure if she used that as an excuse). I proceeded to wait for about another 5 minutes and said - this McFlurry is almost melted and I'm still waiting for the second one.  How long does it take to get cups from the back?  She then hurried to the back (I waited another 2 minutes) and she came back frantically pumping caramel into the bottom of what looked like she was struggling as it was empty.  I wanted to tell her that if it is empty, nothing is going to come out and maybe they need to refill it.  I was very close to telling her to forget about it but I was having a McFlurry craving and I had already paid.  About almost 10 minutes passed before I received my second McFlurry.  The first McFlurry was almost like ice cream soup by the time I got to my car.    What happened to McDonalds? They used to have high quality service from what I could remember but this is just ridiculous.  I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"What do you expect! This is a fast food chain. Cheap food, cheap labor, equals inferior products. So, I already knew what I was going to get. However, I was hungry and grabbed a breakfast sandwich.  Not sure why so many people expect better from a fast food franchise."}
{"text":"Normally, I don't criticize McDonalds much; I know what to expect when I order food there, and their customer service is usually good and fast. But I must say that this particular location has provided me with very slow service most of the times that I have been there in the morning. I have been there 2-3 times in the evenings which were fine, but in the mornings when I used to go on my way to work, they are very disorganized. There is usually no line-up, so people just stand around until the counter staff ask who is next; this has been the case since I first went there few years ago, which is why I try not to go too often. The last time I went for breakfast, my sandwich was ready fairly quickly, but then I had to wait almost 5min just for my coffee!! There were only about half-dozen customers ordering, which is not that busy compared to other locations I have visited in the morning. I have filled out a few of their online surveys to make these same comments, but it hasn't seemed to help."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service! Food was cold. Place was not well kept. I think maybe not enough personal!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this mcdonalds. I love that it is so close to home. While I try not to eat too much fast food, it's nice to have the option and not have to drive too far to get it.  Some it opened, there have been problems at the drive through almost every time. They consistently get my orders wrong; cheese when I ask for no cheese, no sweetness on my sweet tea, missing items. It just gets to a point where one gets frustrated and doesn't want to go back. I will say that today's visit was fine and I went inside as I had time. The tables were clean and the staff was friendly. I think you have a better experience if you order inside."}
{"text":"Unbelievably awful. Forgot half my order and when I called to get a refund, the wonderful manager hung up on me. This is like the 5th time they have messed up my order. Don't waste your time here. Go anywhere else and it would be better than McDonalds."}
{"text":"When you go to this place expect that 75% of your order will be wrong.  Screw ups in the last 2 weeks  Sausage McMuffin with Egg and Cheese -  did not put sausage on   Double Cheeseburger - missing 1 of the 2 patties  Coke Zero - received Diet Coke   Numerous Missing items -breakfast burrito, fries and kids toy  Repeatedly does not provide napkins   How can you be this bad????"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this spot for ice cream, I wait in line for a while with ice cream options flashing on the large digital menu. Finally get to the counter and hear, \"the ice cream machine is not working\". Really? Come on, it's summer and you continuously fail to provide a basic item on your menu. Get it together. Safe to say I shall never visit this location. Avoid if you want ice cream, this spot will disappoint you"}
{"text":"Just went here and ordered a Big Mac and got it on a cheeseburger bun. I guess it's ok to rip customers off, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always good predictable service and food."}
{"text":"Not very impressed today I asked for a large mocha, they put whip on and this is what it looks like when all the whip melts half ass mocha that's not even a large it's half empty. Instead of worrying over the whip cream just fill up the damn mocha seriously it's sure funny Starbucks doesn't have this problem but then again I don't feel like dropping almost $6 bucks on a mocha that's why I come here"}
{"text":"Tried the Create your own taste option and was blown away!!! The food was fresh the pickles were soooo goood!! I really like how they have someone personally bring out your food impressed"}
{"text":"This is the WORST McDonalds in their entire system.  The seldom get your drive thru order correct.  The Decaf Coffee is usually luke warm or cold.   Last week it was the cold coffee.  Today I ordered the breakfast sandwich meal.  I specifically asked if they had it on biscuits four times.  And she said yes.  At the window I only get the sandwich on an English muffin.  No meal.    Also, I told the managers several times that they never say \"Good Morning\" or \"Thank you\" or \"Have a nice day\".  Nothing.  Sometimes all you get is a hand out for the money.  No words spoken. Or a bag handed to you.  No words spoken.   I think I'll have to go out of my way to Tim's.  And I hate Tim's coffee and breakfast.  But at least they don't spoil your day first thing in the morning.    The other McDonalds are great.  This one sucks."}
{"text":"I come here for coffee at lunch (around 1 PM) and the drive-thru usually takes a while. I think they recognize this as well since they have parking for drivers that need to wait a bit longer for their order so they don't hold the line up.  Inside the McDonald's there's a kid's play place and there's at least 2 TV's. They have specialty McCafe beverages to order from which is useful if you want to redeem your free drink from purchasing 7 hot beverages.  I'm a die-hard McNugget fan so I'm probably biased if you ask me if they have any good food.   Also, if you're down to try something weird, oreo mcflurry with their fries is bomb."}
{"text":"Ordering system needs another rethink. So slow. Smokehouse Angus came with shriveled dry slaw and only a tiny amount of BBQ sauce. Nothing like the pictures in their advertising."}
{"text":"Went to this Mcdonalds and Dre took our order. What a man. This man really made our day with  a 20 piece nugget, extra sauce, and 3 free strawberry pies because of an earlier inconvenience. Great Food, Good Prices. Excellent."}
{"text":"I despise this McDonalds. The line is always long, the cashier never knows what they are doing, always needs help. It takes 15 minutes or more to get a simple ice cream cone. I have never had a good experience here. 20 minutes still waiting on the ice cream cone."}
{"text":"I dread going to this McDonald's because of how long the drive-thru takes. Each time I visit, it never fails and I end up waiting 15 minutes for a damn drink. Don't stop here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Sad but true that I am the duchess of this location and it's McDs,  but in my neighborhood there aren't many choices.  My kid and I like their breakfast,  drinks, and ice cream (healthier Mcd options)  It doesn't matter what time of day I come to this location, they are soooooo SsssLLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWW! Especially the morning times.  I'm wtiting this review while waiting on 2 hash browns, and I ordered 10minutes ago and am still the 3rd car in.  They never have enough help and move so slow, 14 min total in the drive thru is ridiculous.   But I keep coming back and so does the rest neighborhood because they are so busy."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. This place has subpar service for subpar food (even by McDonald's standards) and is just a horrible experience whenever I happen to stop by for a quick burger or coffee. The employees seem like they'd rather be anywhere but there and more often than not are joking around with each other rather than actually serving customers. The food itself is poorly made and makes me rethink my life choices as I sit there in one of the dirtiest, rundown McDonald's I've ever been in. Not to mention it takes forever to the food to even be ready. This place needs some new management or a renovation because something's gotta change."}
{"text":"?yonge st??RU????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????mc cafe????????"}
{"text":"This Mcdonalds sucks! For one there's drug addicts coming in and out of the place. To make things worst they let these folks just hang around inside and outside the McDonalds. The place is always dirty especially the bathroom. I went in there today and the damn cashier wanted me to pay .11 cents more for an extra sauce. Are you fuckin serious!?? With what you have to deal with by just visiting the place you would think they wouldn't mind. This place is a dump!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the Foody Mart plaza (Originally a Food Basics), this newly renovated McD's has definitely made a step forward in trying to accomodate customers within the horrendous parking lot it is situated in. Honestly, it's almost impossible to find a parking spot when Foody Mart starts promotions and discounts (which is almost, always).   They divided the drive-thru lane into 2 lanes for better customer flow and to avoid the traffic jams it had caused before with the long line-ups. Drive-thru opened until midnight.  After the renovations, this McD's gives off a modern look after maintaining the retro design for so many years. Equipped with a new McCafe station, this McD's is updated in its menu list.  Managed by teenagers behind the counter, service can get quite slow for customers who walk-in as drive-thru customers usually get priority. I could be standing for 10 mins before someone decides to come back to the front counter.  Overall, clean interior and bathrooms. Screaming kids at the playplace. Usually a quick grab and go for a late night unhealthy snack, after hitting the gym. Why do I do this to myself?"}
{"text":"To say that \"you know what you're getting\" with a McDonald's is a misstatement. You truly don't know what you're getting until you open the box and find a Big Mac comprised of three buns and one patty. (I'm looking at you, Detroit.)  This is why I'm compelled to write about this new McDonald's in Brampton.   I've never had a Big Mac so perfectly crafted. I should have taken a picture. The buns were symmetrical all the way through. The sauces were perfectly proportioned. Everything about it was what you would expect looking at the menu.   I went through the drive-thru and they even managed to get my strange order right without having to ask for clarification or typing in the wrong order.  Bravo, young McD's. Bravo."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the MickyDee's chain but they do serve a purpose. Having just moved and needing food for the fridge after painting all day, I headed out to Metro - the local 24-hr grocery store around 2:00 in the morning. Metro was actually closed and I was famished. I broke down and got some grub at this 24-hr McDonald's and a cup of coffee. The food is crap, standard for the chain. But the coffee wasn't bad. I got a large mocha which was around $4.00. Larger than Tim's large and more flavourful. Would I go out of my way for it? No. But if I am wanting a coffee and nearby McDonald's, now I won't drive further."}
{"text":"Stopped for coffee and oatmeal and it took ten minutes. Yep, ten minutes and there was no one ordering but me. First, the cashier kept asking Linda (manager) for change. Why he was asking was a mystery to me given I was using a card. How did I know the manager's name was Linda you ask? Well the cashier yelled out her name while I was standing a foot in front of him, over and over again and from the look on her face she could care less. Now why my oatmeal and coffee took so long to get, you got me. You would have to ask one of the six employees I saw who were just chatting with each other. As for the oatmeal and coffee, both were good. Can't make up though for the bad service."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's to date. Took the family for Labor Day treat. Got a two can dine coupon and got shafted for using a coupon. The McChicken was a year old and tasted like shoe leather. The fries were not done for at least a few hours and sprite was soapy water without any carbonation. Wasted my money even with a discount coupon. Never again..."}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow service from beginning to end. This is a small outlet in a busy area but it was quiet on a late night Thursday. I waited a few minutes a the drive thru to order and then stuck 10 minutes in a short line to pick up."}
{"text":"This location at Power & queen creek never has a working shake machine!!! yesterday it was St. Patrick's Day and NO shamrock shake!!! Today no shakes still. What a joke!!'"}
{"text":"The worst Mcdonalds i have ever been to. EVER. Something is always wrong, today neither of their drive through speakers work.  I keep hoping praying someone fixes all the issues with this McDonalds, but nope something is ALWAYS wrong. I guess God is trying to save my arteries one bad visit at a time."}
{"text":"Nice n quick . Humble staff n good at its best with Mc standards.  Still love their old double cheese burger .slurp slurp ! Midnight meals are a hit !"}
{"text":"I come by this location a few times a week for my morning coffee. Depending on the time of day that I go, it can either be brain numbingly long drive thru lines or in an out in 2 minutes.   The morning shift has two wonderful ladies who run a really tight ship. The are great as they are fast, friendly and I wish they would work on the weekend because the weekend morning staff is the exact opposite.  They recently fixed the potholes so it makes for a much easier entrance.  There are two lanes to which I almost always pick the slow one.   The convenience factor of how close this is to my work is a bonus, but overall I prefer to come to this location because of the great morning staff.   My coffee is perfect 9 times out of 10.  Always a bonus!  4/5"}
{"text":"This McDonalds has the worst service. We don't go to McDonalds often and the few times we have gone here they screw up your order. I did not check my order this morning and got home and sure enough a sandwich was missing. The other food also tasted like it was sitting under the warmer forever.   I tried calling the store four times and no one picked up. I then called the customer service department to tell them about the poor service. I don't have high expectations when it comes to fast food, but at the minimum put the right food in the bag.   Thanks for making it easier to not go back :-)"}
{"text":"For as McDonald's goes this 1 taste great food always looks like the commercials well at late night. It's the only time I go but the people r awake willing and ready. The restaurant is still open after midnight not just the drive thru and importantly it's always clean. Rita 1 of the managers there is always bustling back and forth to serve the late/early dinner crowd. Only reason I didn't rate higher is well it's still McDonald's"}
{"text":"Ordered two sausage Mc Griddles. Wait 10. Went back up for a soda. Waited half an hour and asked to see about my order. The lady at the register took my receipt to the back. 10 minutes later I get my order. That is a total of 50 minutes just for one order. I would rather go to the one on 83 and Indian school for better service from now on."}
{"text":"I normally like McDonalds but this one has the two drive-thru windows and has just got my order incorrect for the 4th time.  I stopped going to this store because I got frustrated with the dive through and the Manager's blame the employee's attitude.  Today the Taco Bell right next to it had 4 or 5 cars in the drive through and MDs only had one so I took the chance.  Great news, they got my sandwich and fries correct and even though i ordered and Iced tea and got a coke instead.  2 out of 3 is the best you can hope for at this store."}
{"text":"When this McDonalds opened it was a great place to go for any meal. Over the years it has been in a steady decline. They are slow, disorganized, understaffed and quite frankly the owner doesnt care how you feel about his McDonalds.  Food is often cold, undercooked and stale. My hope is they will figure out how to run a restaurant before it has to shut their doors.  Waited 45 min in line at 9:30 and the person taking money was the only person there to take orders and cook to.  Oh their was the guy doing dishes.  Two people for all the cars in line waiting"}
{"text":"I guess this McD is consistently poor in service. I waited FIFTEEN minutes for ONE iced coffee. When I asked for the status of my drink, I was rudely told to wait. I waited another five but still no sign of iced coffee. I asked for a refund and the employee refused, telling me to wait again. I gave them another two minutes and told them this is not acceptable. A manager-looking person came and issued the refund in cash when I had paid with a credit card. No apologies whatsoever. No one really expects a five-star restaurant service at McD's, but this is beyond ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just got home and there is no meat on the egg mcmuffins or sausage mcmuffins.  Too far away to go back. There is always something with this location!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, head office has to do something about this location. Terribly managed, the people behind the counter have 0 greeting skills, and don't understand the idea behind fast food....  It took 8 minutes exactly before someone came to the counter to take our order. It took 2 minutes to give a 3 meal order (am I not articulating enough? How about look at me when you take my order?)  Absolutely terrible location. Never again... If we didn't have a long day and were starving, would've continued on to Wendy's."}
{"text":"my husband ordered breakfast at this location and while he was waiting for his food he seen a cockroach on the inside of the drivthru window!! The worker said they are everywhere and the managers don't do anything about it. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? A 24-hour McDonalds in my Hotel?!?! I only went once. it would have been three times, but the line was long for me two other times. Minus two stars."}
{"text":"The store is filthy....not one clean table to sit at and the floors are disgusting...service is so slow!!! Shape it up ....former employee in my younger years....would not have had a job if our store looked like this with equally disappointing service!"}
{"text":"Went again against my better judgement all I wanted was a Frappe, a lousey coffee on a Saturday morning at 8:08 AM and again I get \"Our Frappe machine is down for cleaning\".  What kind of mis-managed establishment cleans a coffee machine at the beginning of the breakfast rush?  McDonalds Corp. please step in and spank this location, they are in way over their heads.   Ps, I know your maintenence crews clean those machines at night so come up with a better excuse for your shortcomings...."}
{"text":"McDonald's never fails to deliver. They have a cool kiosk where you can order also instead of going up front. But I guess I'm more traditional and like talking to the workers so I ordered at the counter lol."}
{"text":"The guy in the drive thru didn't give us any straws ! Didn't put the combos in separate bags like we asked and our fries were cold. He was nice though but won't ever come here again! Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"Guaranteed to test your patience. This location has the worst service I have ever experienced in any restaurant anywhere. Slow, order mix ups, staff and managers who don't seem to have a clue or care.  It never improves. It's actually turned me off going to any McDonald's. Shame, I miss the coffee and muffins!"}
{"text":"McDonalds is McDonalds; the food and the drinks are always the same but the huge difference with the McDonalds on Green Street is the service. I went in really early this morning just to grab a caramel iced coffee after a long night of studying, and I ended up leaving with a huge smile on my face! I got smiles from both the cashier and the man handing me my food followed by, \"Have a really great day!\" and it made a huge difference in my mood. Thanks so much, Green Street McDonalds :)"}
{"text":"20 minute wait in line for them to say \"no, we dont have ice cream\". I mentioned a sign posted would be nice - no comment, no apology."}
{"text":"Gross! Pulled up to the drive through and there were cars wrapped around the place. Decided to just go and and what a mistake that was! We walked in and turned around and walked right back out. The place was disgusting and it smelled like old trash and or sewage. Kinda glad we decided to walk in and not wait in the line. Can only imagine what the smell was coming from. We will definitely not be returning to this location!!"}
{"text":"Smaller McDonalds but awesome location at Deerfoot meadows.  Friendly staff and very clean store.  A few tv's throughout and fireplace.  Only downside is no kids playground and only 3 large tables for groups of 4 and up.  Free wifi too."}
{"text":"Been sitting in this line for 20 minutes already.. this place is going to make me late back from work.."}
{"text":"Just got back from Lahaina in Maui, Hawaii. I had McDonald's scrambled eggs big breakfast several times while I was there. So good! Wonderful food on the island! Breakfast was so good and moist! Scramble eggs and white rice was very moist. Guava and apple pie's where deep-fried.  The old fashion way how McDonald's used to cook their pies in the past. Came home to this location and had my husband go get me a big breakfast. Very disappointed! Eggs were dry, biscuit was dry and tastelessness. Even the Hashbrowns and baked apple pie was super dry. Nothing like how it was prepare on the island. McDonald's is awesome in Maui! They definitely need to make changes here in Arizona."}
{"text":"I come to the McDonald's often in the morning since its close to work. Food is standard McDonald's quality. Consistent all around. What is poor is the lack of service and line management. Almost every time I go, the line is a mess. When more than one cashier is open, there's only one line that forms.  Also, what will happen in the morning is that the cashier will take everyone's order. Then you have 5-10 receipts on the counter waiting to be filled. Most usually coffee. But everyone is just standing around waiting. It's highly inefficient. This place needs to hire more staff or have the cashier pour coffee when there is no line."}
{"text":"A clean and modern McDonalds. Play area for the little booger makers and a TV w/ ESPN for the old farts.  Two drive-thru lines to speed up the ordering process, and I've never had any issues w/ the drive thru. All this equates to a solid three stars."}
{"text":"Seriously they close the place down. I had quite a few bad experience ordering mobile. I would order and when I go pick it up, there was always an issues. Specially at night time. I don't know why they were open late night....if they weren't going to serve you. I don't blame the crew it was those unexperienced so called managers, that didn't quite care about their job, nor the crew. They didn't have heart for their job. If they only knew a little bit about costumer service, the place would've been quite successful. Good location, alot of customers, filling up gas. But the managers didn't care to put an effort to make it work. McDonald's corporation should send their employees to management classes, so this could've been prevented. Lost a good revenue, so I say shame  on those managers, you made  good people lose their job. A word of advice to those unexperienced \"managers\" treat your work place like if you were the owner. And remember one important thing, customer service and satisfaction is key to keep a business running successfully."}
{"text":"The last 4 times here they have screwed up my order.  They have NEVER given me sauces with my nuggets even though I ask and they confirm what I want.  Last night we ordered 5 McDouble's and 4 of them were wrong...and 2 of them weren't \"custom\" sandwiches."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm reviewing a McDs...but this is the absolute worst location that we have ever been to.  It's a running joke in our family now.  Literally every time we drive thru, our order is wrong and we have to walk inside to get it corrected.  This weekend, my husband purposely ordered for the boys inside, and they still messed it up!  A couple of months ago, they asked me to pull aside in the drive thru and wait in a parking spot since they were behind on fries.  So, I waited... and waited... and watched 10 cars pull away with their food...And I'm Positive that every one of those cars had fries in the order.  After 15 minutes... 15 MINUTES... I walked inside to find my order sitting on the counter...they completely forgot about us.  They couldn't have cared less...barely an apology.  It is a complete joke to them!"}
{"text":"30 mins for a Big Mac combo no pickles - I think not. This is a serious downgrade from my last review. I think it has to do with the manager on duty. Friday, Nov 10, 12:30am. Fire her pls.   They are usually decent and deliver what you need. I have no idea why it took so long when I arrived."}
{"text":"Average McD's, a bit out of the way though. I see it every time I drive SB on Deerfoot from Cross Iron Mills. They're in dire need for staff, but it also doesn't seem to get too busy here. The downside to low staffing is they've downsized the number of cashiers to 1-2 tills and replaced them with self-serve kiosks (see pictures). The kiosks work fast, but it would've been nice to tell someone in 2 seconds that I wanted strawberry added to my Oreo McFlurry instead of spending the time figuring out their system. The remoteness of this McD offers a quiet ambience; I saw lots of people chilling and hanging out on their laptops and phones. McDonald's new marketing campaign to make their sitting areas less cafeteria-like seems to be working.   What I like the most is this McD is directly adjacent to Kinjo so I can get a Jr. Chicken burger for dessert after a sushi meal. The fat kid in me is very pleased."}
{"text":"I often stop at this location on my way to one of the nearby golf courses. Today, however, my playing partners were all hungry after our round and this was the nearest restaurant.  I ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Angus burger with fries and a Coke. It didn't look anything like the picture on the menu. Mine was very flat. It tasted okay but maybe I'll stick with the Big Mac next time. They've been making it the same way for decades."}
{"text":"This location has reopened, but I wouldn't eat anything again! I was hoping it might improve after the remodel and at LEAST serve hot food, but NO! I am not even sure hot patties would make a difference."}
{"text":"My son and I usually come once a week to get breakfast here. We come between 6:30 and 7. Today was the third time waiting in the Drive-Thru for 15 to 20 minutes just to get a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee. We will not be able to come for breakfast anymore with waits this long.My one star is for the two gentlemen that work the register and give the food they're always very professional and pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm not really fan of junk food but Sunday late night there no other choice in the area!  There are few at cashier who have attitude and does a matter what you say or order they make fun of you, it happens almost Everytime I come here to me and others.   Very dirty and always so many flys next to soft drink machine .   Food preparation is by hand and no gloves .   I wouldn't even give one star of I could !"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this McDonalds no stars. I'm a very polite person , and although my situation was horrible in my opinion I don't think I was rude other than a lil firm . I went to order through the drive through and apparently the guy couldn't hear me so I said my order louder. I get that. What I don't get is that once I'm done talking he says \"give me a minute \" so I did. After that minute he says \"ok so what did you say.\" Excuse me? Why didn't you tell me you weren't paying attention to me in the first place , he must have been speaking to guest before me! That was rude . So then I said.\" Can I just pull up to the window , to which he replies \"sure I guess (with a sarcastic tone)\" . At the window I asked him to repeat my order , he continues and I said ok , he says \"if you need a manager you can request one in the next window .\" First of all if I needed a manager I would have already requested one, second why would you say that ? That infuriated me . It was as if he knew he wasn't giving me the customer service and yet didn't care because someone else can speak to me and probably do nothing . I didn't say ok , I didn't say nothing I just looked at him as he closed his window on me. Upon second window I received my order and guy also seemed a bit rude , but I tried not to pay mind to it . I thought I was missing a breakfast burrito to wish he then asked for me to return my bags and receipt . Then he returned everything to me and said \" it's all the way at the bottom . I asked for more ketchup and hot sauce , he ignored me. I asked again , he hears me and only gives me 2 of each , I asked for more to witch he grabbed a bunch hands it to me and let's go right before I could catch it all and I lost it in the corner of my car seats . He didn't even apologize , instead he turns around . I said \"I just wanted to let you know the guy in the other window was a bit rude.\" He then said \" I'll let my manager know.\" That's it . I was furious . Not only was he rude as well but apparently no one cares , nor do they know a proper response . No customer service at all !!!!!! What's worst is I don't eat McDonald's ever, but today I'm in the must of my move and this happens . I know their names but won't burn them and that is only because I'm hoping it was just a bad day they were having , but by the other reviews I doubt it ."}
{"text":"This place is like the Jurassic Park of McDonaldsis, McDonaldses? McDonaldi? Anyways... I come here when I want to feel the adrenaline rush of being a bada** without actually ever being in any real danger. Like there are normally gangs of scary looking 12 year olds hanging around, I probably wouldn't be scared of them if I weren't such a nerd in high-school but it gives me that thrill that my mundane life needs. 10/10"}
{"text":"This McDonald's in particular definitely attracts a variety of people ranging from:  Disgruntled fatties, pan handlers, meth addicts, coke users drinking coke, conspiracy theorists who rage in public. local community housing hood rats. and seniors demanding refills.  I do enjoy their baked apple pies that expire in 2 hours though :)"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews, thought maybe it was an exaggeration.. after all, how bad could it be? Well today, I witnessed the worse McDonald's in my life. First off, the parking lot and the design of the drive thru is horrendous. Simply terrible.. not enough parking and the way the drive thru cuts through the path to MCD is really strange. Also it is a one way design so that adds to the confusion. I came during breakfast and ordered a standard egg McMuffin combo... Definitely did not expect a wait over 25 minutes and the order to come out messed up. If I wanted that sort of wait, I could've gone to a Coras. No idea how that could occur since I've seen busier MCD bust out orders within 5 minutes. I hate to blame the employees but whoever is managing this store is doing a terrible job."}
{"text":"Easily the slowest and dirtiest McDonalds I've been to. My Big breakfast order literally took 17 mins this morning when I asked to talk with the manager, he said it happens and tried to offer me a apple pie. The tables are all filthy. This is the norm for this location."}
{"text":"There was so much grease on everything you could barely pick up the burger cause the bottom bun was just wet bread. Even the box was starting to leak thru.  The customer service was fine and fries were ok."}
{"text":"Omg I never had issues here, been coming here for 3 years. Why just why would you not put our chicken nuggets when I ordered a happy meal and also the fries were cold and hard, very hard, extremely salty. And buttermilk chicken sandwich was dry. I always get this. Now I have to hear my child cry because his nuggets weren't there."}
{"text":"I had to eat a quick lunch yesterday and the only thing in the neighborhood was a McDonald's.  Persconally, I love McDonald's but this day I just didn't feel like a burger (BYW: get two $1 McDouble's, remove the bottom buns, slap them together as a double, fabulous!)  But this day, I  bought a Southwest Chicken salad.  Seriously, the best $5 salad in town!  Whole, grilled breast, for $1 LESS than Chick Fil A and better.  Gotta run, really really good chicken salad!"}
{"text":"An awesome new McDonald's in the north part of Brampton this McDonald's has all the latest and greatest McDonald's technology.  Conveniently located at Bramalea and Sandlewood, this McD is being built in a large new mall area.  The design of this location is modern and spacious.  Nice open sight lines in the dining room and lots of windows for lots of light.  I usually have my morning coffee and muffin at another McD down the street, but when I entered this location..the experience was IMHO the future of fast food ordering!!  This location has 4 automated touch screen terminals that you can order your  meal through.  The interface is very intuitive and the selections are easily navigated.  There is also a staff member here to guide guests through their choices.  As soon as your order is complete, you send the order directly to the kitchen.  Basically they have increased the number of cashiers and increased connivence for the guests by making the process automated.  I was told this is great for people who want to order smaller orders and not have to wait in line for the guest who has 5 children and tons of modifications.  You pay for your order using debit, credit or gift card and then you take your receipt to a common pick up area for all the orders.  There is a large number on the receipt which will be displayed on a large flat screen when its ready.  Pretty efficient, almost mechanical...but for tech nerds like me its awesome!!! There is a lot of new innovations at this location, including the ordering stations, iPads to check your email and games for the kids, large screen displays, guest experience staff who walk the dining area etc..For those with kids..there is also a playland area that is sparkling new, the staff are friendly and very helpful (it is the first week of opening and only time will tell if this will be the norm) and to top it all off ...its 24 hours..  Its good to see a Mc's close to where I live (muffin and coffee fan!!)  I am excited to see these innovations in fast food and guest experience...great job McD's...5 stars!! Wow!"}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST MCDONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO. the staff is just awful and all the 5 times i've been there, they always get my order wrong. always. i've even called the manager and they are beyond useless and have no sense of customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"All I can ask is that my cheese on my sandwiches get cooked or melted whichever one pertains to the company. I'm a little tired of receiving food this way."}
{"text":"Seriously don't know how this store stays open other than apathy of its customers. It is by far the worst managed McDonalds in the city. I have tried multiple times to go and end up leaving because it is sooooo slow. Today we waited 14 minutes in the drive they and they forgot two items!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm pinching myself that I could give Rotten Ronnie's a 4 star lol.  But here's why:  self serve touch screen kiosks!  Don't have these back home -- yet.  Good idea if I'm a franchise owner, save the labour and speed up the lines.  Now there's no miscommunication.  Love their separate counter just for coffee, less waiting time!  Even late night, it is safe here with mostly students."}
{"text":"One of the prettiest Mcdonald's I've seen...orange trendy stools, a communal table, and lots of seating on the left.  And the drive-thru? must be doing some serious business, it's even longer than the restaurant.  24 hrs."}
{"text":"Morning at 7 is disastrous: the lady at cashier is mad at us; she takes orders in wrong and stares at kids almost makes them cry, then they couldn't order straight. Just weird experience."}
{"text":"Bunch of morons working here. Drive thru order with a sausage and cheese biscuit. After 4 attempts trying to make this guy understand we don't want egg on it, don't want bacon on it, they make us park and wait. Food comes out cold and no ketchup. Oh and the biscuit STILL had egg!! Why did we agree to increase the minimum wage for people who can't even do their jobs correctly?"}
{"text":"The parking drama in this McDonald's already gets rid of a star, so let's not start there. I ordered a McChicken from this restaurant earlier today. The cashier and ordering process went smoothly, and I paid for my meal.  Then came the waiting.  5 minutes...  10 minutes...  15 minutes...  ...until the cashier finally noticed I was still there, asking if I received my order yet. Uh, no? Otherwise why would I still be here? After going through the barrage of meals, she finally found mine at the far back and picked it up, 20 minutes after I initially ordered my meal. She repeatedly said sorry to me and that they were understaffed (didn't seem like it), and she will have a talk with the boss about my order being looked over.  The McChicken tasted okay, nothing special. Fortunately for them, this and the cashier's initiative to right things up, I upped it from a one star to a two star."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the slowest McDonald's I've been to, the parking lot is terrible and they're slow as hell. Been waiting for my breakfast for 15 mins now. Terrible management."}
{"text":"For when its late, the fridge is bare, and you have given up on chasing the treasures and adorations of the world there is always some dry shit at McDonald's to choke on."}
{"text":"Online, it shows this location is open 24 hours. My hubby was wanting something to eat on his drive to work. When we got to the drive-thru (0300) they had two wet floors signs blocking the entry. This isn't the first time they have been closed when we have tried to get some food around this time. I'm definitely not trying to sound picky, but why advertise being open! No wonder the del taco in the same shopping center is so busy!!"}
{"text":"I have had the nice pleasure of visiting this location of McDonalds a few times and will definitely keep coming back to this location whenever I'm in the area. The staff here are very courteous, friendly, cheerful, and efficient. Especially the nice lady cashier with the East European accent. She is an excellent counter attendant, very courteous, friendly, cheerful, and efficient. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. The interior dining area is immaculately clean and has plenty of tables. The staff regularly clean the tables. Prime central location in the Dundas and Shorncliffe area of Etobicoke, plenty of parking, close to Highways of 427, Gardiner/QEW. Literally down the road from TTC's Kipling Subway Station and from the famous Cloverdale Mall (opened in 1956). Bus stops at doorstep for many frequent routes (local and express) of TTC and MiWay. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff of this McDinalds for making my visits very enjoyable one and I look forward to continue being a patron at your nice location on an ongoing basis whenever I'm in the area. God Bless."}
{"text":"By far the worst McDonald's I've been to. Took 5 minutes just to get a coffee. Credit card machines were down. Food came out wrong. They ran out of utensils."}
{"text":"Attempted to come here many times. Usually just for coffee and rarely ever breakfast. This location is way too slow, and everyone inside always seems dazed, perplexed and confused about what needs to be done. Breakfast needs to be fast and seem less, so if you don't want to be late for work.... don't come here."}
{"text":"Well this McD is in a small tiny strip mall. There is subway beside it. I usually don't go to this location. There are lots of homeless people in the area. Its across from the park. Came here and got fries and apple pies. Service was ok. Nothing too special. Décor is very outdated here."}
{"text":"A pretty solid McDonalds location, the service is good, and the staff provide quick service. The only frustrating thing, is that their parking lot is super tight, and the drive thru is on an incline, so it's a little scary when your moving from one window to the next, and you can feel your car rolling back."}
{"text":"This location is so GHETTO!  The parking lot has had the same huge crack running the entire width for years now and it's enough to knock out your alignment.  I guess the owner of this location is depending on his visitors to be mass transit riders so repaving his parking lot must seem like a waste of money.    News flash:  McDonald's is struggling all over the United States - you'd better get more concerned with bringing in a better type of consumer like the ones that actually drive themselves."}
{"text":"This is the McDonald's I usually go to since it's the closest to my home. Depending on when you go, it can be very busy, especially during coupon time. The speed of the service will of course depend on how busy it is. I have never had any problems with the staff (always friendly and helpful)."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star to the shitty establishment I would. Everyone that works here is a degenerate no life loser. The GM Blanca is the biggest fucking bitch I've ever met in my life. Dumb bitch needs to worry less about her 10 pounds of make up and more about how she talks to paying customers and her fellow employees."}
{"text":"As a former employee of the Golden Arches I am sad to see how bad this McDonald's is. The food is what it is, not good not bad, just blah.  However, the service is horrendous! Not only that but I've called their management offices and left messages and I get no call back at all.  I avoid them and go get my cheap fast food elsewhere.  It's not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"They call it rotten Ronnie's for a reason... it will rot your guts! And, that's why so many of us drive through at 3am to get 6 chicken nuggets with mac sauce on the side along with a junior double cheese burger and junior mcchicken in order to create a \"McGang-Bang\" (see secret menu online for more details).  Don't judge me, you know you've been there too. HAHA!"}
{"text":"The worst place in the world. I have lived in North Collinwood for six month and they have not fixed their pop machine since I have been here. I also got my monopoly game pieces stolen from the workers so they could get a free fry or warm tea since they don't have pop. Poop on you lakeshore mc deeez nuts."}
{"text":"QI, People, QI.  I was on a road trip passing through Charlotte and thought I would stop at McDonald's for dinner.  When I got off the interstate, I did not realize this location as about three miles off the interstate, but I went anyways (not good during rush hour time.)  I was only going though the drive through.  I saw person before me drive away and realized they were missing part of their order.  Then my turn comes. Drink and hamburgers come out, but not fries.  Had to remind employee part of my order was missing.  I was directed another way back to the interstate seeing that if I waited a couple of miles on the interstate I would have come across another McDonald's (closer to the interstate)."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of this McDonald's from when I was five years old. As an adult however, they can never get any of my orders right. I'm constantly needing to go back to get things that are missing.  That being said, it has been updated and it is quite nice inside. The bathrooms are clean. I just think the service should be more of a priority."}
{"text":"This is a peculiar McDonald's for sure. I feel like for a place that is rarely packed they do take longer than usual. One incident was really odd as well. When the mcpick 2 involved filet o fish sandwiches I went over and ordered 2 but did not tell them specifically I wanted Mcpick 2 filet o fish. Technically it's the same sandwich and you would think their computers would know it's on the menu. Nope, I was charged the normal price and didn't realize it till I got home...kind of stingy. You would also assume the associates would know their own menu. Maybe it's a cheap money tactic...don't ask, no discount."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is literally the stingiest/cheapest store I've ever visited. The managers make all of their staff fill the coffees like an inch below the rim, like about 80% full. Every. Single. Goddamn. Time. They do this for their iced coffees too. Every time I tell them to top it off they roll their eyes like I'm being difficult. They also fill their fry containers half full. Sending in complaints to their store doesn't do anything."}
{"text":"Out of the 2 times I've been here they were bad encounters which were both through drive thru. We went on a Friday night at around 11 & the women on the speaker told us it was closed? But online it says 24 hrs... Strange? Or lazy? The second time i asked the lady at the window if she could add a drink, she rolled her eyes & walked away."}
{"text":"Most of the time, I have no issues her. Food is good. Drive through is fast, although at times they get really busy and backed up. That is when it gets frustrating.  Especially when people sit talking on there phones instead of moving up. Throwing everything off.  The people who work there are nice nice, but you can tell that they rather have a job that pays more.  One good thing is tgat, they offer discount to uninformed police,  military and firefighters. Because they protect us. However,  that leaves out plainclothes police officers and detectives, FBi/CIA/TSA agents and security officer's. What are they? Chopped liver.  All and all, they are a good place to go. And I will go again."}
{"text":"The drive in service was so slow.  Ordered two coffee and a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel.  Had to pull up and wait 5 minutes for the bagel.  Wtf.   After waiting and driving off. The one bagel order was wrong.  Multigrain is not cinnamon and raisins.  Not worth turning around with a Huge line up and morning traffic.  Leave the bagels to Tim Hortons.  You never have to wait"}
{"text":"I counted at least 7 to 8 employees in the store. With only one person on the register. it didn't matter how many people were in the lobby they didn't add anyone to the register nor did anyone help the cashier. The manager should be fired.  I've never seen such a blatant disregard for customers! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Worst location EVER and the absolute slowest service I have ever endured through a drive-through. Pretty sure the staff is only one person working the entire restaurant I ordered my food at 12:27 AM and received it through the drive-through at 12:52! Are you kidding me !! Not to mention the girl at the first window left it unattended so I pulled forward to pay at the second window and of course the cars follow me forward, as I approach the second window the employee at the first window shouts for me to backup!! Are you dumb?? AND BACK UP INTO THE CAR BEHIND ME- No Common Sense! Wait time is unacceptable, employees and management are horrible, food is old, cold, dry and disgusting."}
{"text":"So when I was a teen I worked at a McDonalds and from that experience you get to eat things when they are fresh off the grill.  It's a BIG difference, trust me. I really like this McDonalds because they keep their foods fresh.  The workers could be a bit nicer but I remember when I use to work there, you're tired from standing for hours, oily from frying fries all day, and have to smile at those crazy customers.. but it does make the experience better when you have a nice staff at the drive-thru window, I mean be nice to those who are nice to you, smile!  They are open 24 hours Friday and Saturday AND they have SAUSAGE EGG MCMUFFIN at 12am! Best idea ever.. in a sense... because now on Fridays I like to stay up until 12am just to eat that oily breakfast sandwich.  Satisfying yet a bad habit."}
{"text":"Normal McDonald's prices which made me happy. Friendly staff! And also quick service from the line to ordering and order pick up."}
{"text":"This location is on point! From the friendly young man by the name of Avery at the counter to the fresh food and good management. They even made my bacon egg and cheese on a biscuit the way I asked (with a round egg instead of a folded egg) very clean and modern."}
{"text":"This location is brutally slow. My order has been wrong on many occasions. They say that it is suppose to be open 24 hours but when you pull up to order they tell you they are temporarily closed."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  It's McDonalds!!! 24hr. I can't validate any other reviews. Everyone seems on point when I come here. But that just may be my great smile and personality. Who knows.   But it serves its purpose.  Free Wi-Fi  TTFN"}
{"text":"Out of pure convenience this place gets 2 stars. McDonald's is just a place to go to when I'm craving for Mcdonald's or if there's absolutely nothing left.   - CL"}
{"text":"First time I stopped there, I ordered 1 hash brown, 2 sausage and egg mcmuffin, and 1 orange juice. Got to work, I only had 1 of the 2 mcmuffins and got everything else.The second time I went, I ordered 2 orders of only pancakes, 4 sausage and egg mcmuffin, and a hash brown. I got home, no hash brown inside. I shouldn't have to check if I have all I ordered. Its their responsibility to make sure I the customer get everything I order. I will no longer be going to this McDonalds."}
{"text":"Located inside the Walmart, closest to the produce entrance. Has a lot of seats for the little space that they have. They seem to have a lot of fruit flies no matter what season. Friendly staff here, with serve yourself drink location. They have a few booths, though majority of the seating is single chairs."}
{"text":"I made a drive thru order, very quick but I asked for them to be generous with the ketchup they only gave me 4.   Also my fries were not fresh. I prefer freshly hot served.   Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Horrible place!! So apparently McDonalds does not check dates on their products they serve to children. They gave us 3 expired bags of apples today in the kids happy meals  I called them and all they could do was apologize that is unacceptable this nneeds taken up to corporate . There can't be mistakes like that made that's carelessness and unacceptable"}
{"text":"There is exactly 1 improvement on McD menu: red onions choice. But they still serve their sandwiches without melting the cheese & it's lukewarm. At least the fries were hot. Mushrooms have no flavour, they are put on cheese separately instead of melting them with cheese. No wonder everything is bland and tasteless unless you salt & pepper it. I asked for a crispy chicken Swiss Mushroom melt with only red onions & pickles. I loathe ketchup mayonnaise & relish & given I have diabetes I shouldn't have the sugar anyway. The server gives me my order with no cheese & mushroom & then claims I said ONLY red onions & pickles. Then why would I ask for a Swiss Mushroom Melt? Duh! So they remade it. And put on mushrooms separately & didn't melt the Swiss cheese at all. One star is generous."}
{"text":"Today will be THE last time I go to this location. I was looking forward to my favorite cheat meal. Instead I got a cold hamburger, fries thrown inside the bag leaving the fry holder 1/2 full. When I was asked to pull forward I kindly refused not wanting my order to get cold. Then the window attendant told me the fries are in the bottom. I pulled around, walked in the store, asked for a manager and showed her why the order was unacceptable. I dumped out the bag showing all my fries. Then Justin told me to clean up the mess! Stomped away saying \"I was a grown ass woman making a mess\" excuse me??? This will be the last time I get cold food that I paid $8 for..bummer.cheat.meal. Disappointment."}
{"text":"Extremely dangerous location. Unfortunately I have to stay at the sandman hotel across the street. The police are there twice a day. Just pay extra for anywhere else or stay in the hotel."}
{"text":"New automated restaurant with table service for create your taste.  Getting a salad and burger to compare"}
{"text":"I enter McDonald's and the smell of fake meat was in the air. As a regular human I enter the restroom to wash my hands before a meal, as I enter the restroom a saw a sign that said \" Out of Order.\" I ordered a cheeseburger and the waitress brings out a chicken head! What am I supposed to do with a chicken head?"}
{"text":"I am really upset right now. I just saw one of those things that makes you sick to be part of the human race. I was at this McDonalds waiting in line to get some food. An aboriginal man in a wheel chair comes into the store. His clothes were dirty and disheveled so most would assume he was homeless. He went to order some food and even put his $20 bill on the counter and the whole time was being kind and courteous to the staff. The manager came up to him and told him to get out and that people like him were not welcome in the store. I was shocked and told the manager that I was disgusted. He was a human being and a paying customer and I felt he deserved at least some respect. She ignored me and would not even talk to me. Another manager overheard and came to talk to me. I told him that I felt they were denying service to someone because they were aboriginal and homeless. I notified him it is illegal based to deny service based on ethnicity under the Canadian Charter. At this point multiple upset customers start to back me up. The second manager tells them to shut up because he was speaking to me first. I told him I could not believe how disrespectful he was being and asked for my money back because I would never go to that store again. All I could do was go to the man in the wheelchair and say how sorry I was. I said, \"God bless you and you deserve more respect than what you were shown tonight.\""}
{"text":"Came here looking for a \"light\" and cheap breakfast especially with the good deals available on their app. We got BOGO egg, cheese, biscuit. The first one came out with no cheese on it even though it was \"double checked with accuracy\" haha but no biggie they easily corrected it and it was good. Also got a free cup of hot water and just made my own tea. The food was good (hard to get a flattering picture of fast food) but it definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I've never seen a McDonald's with so many problems. I work at the CAL Ranch in the same parking lot every morning I go to get a cup of mocha coffee and every time I go in there cleaning the coffee machine. Who cleans the coffee machine in the morning at breakfast when everybody is drinking coffee? Finally I got mad and I asked the girl what's the deal why are you always cleaning the coffee machine in the morning she turned and asked her manager he just shrugged his shoulders and said you can come back in 15 to 20 minutes he obviously doesn't care. In 15 to 20 minutes I have to be clocked in at my own job I'm usually there between 6:30 AM and 7:00am. Then this morning I pull into the drive through where there is a line of cars and before they take my order they tell me it's cash only! Who carries cash on them anymore I now had to back out of the drive-through because I didn't have time to wait in line to not get any food I wish they would get with it."}
{"text":"Employees not knowledgeable and wait for an iced coffee was long because the staff didn't replenish their stash."}
{"text":"Standard Mcdonalds inside a Walmart. Sometimes has flies, and wait times are a bit long. Security people kinda watch you... I dunno.... maybe I am sketchy looking. :p Okay to grab a bite."}
{"text":"BEWARE WHEN USING YOUR CARD AT THIS LOCATION!   I have two locations close to me but this one in particular is much closer and I will no longer be coming here and I hope neither will you! I used my debit card here and the cashier on November 1st was taking I thought a little too long with my card and she gave it back and I went home to eat my stuff. Now here is the part that makes me angry my card got hit at a circle k down the street of this location and the Home Depot that is close to this location as well. Coincidence? I think not! My bank is still pending on the investigation but I know when and where my card information got stolen. It doesn't take more than five seconds to slide my card and she took a considerable amount of time to believe it wasn't a coincidence. I am furious and wrote McDonald's but still no response so I give you this warning and I WILL NEVER STOP HERE AGAIN. I PREFER TO DRIVE TO THE OTHER LOCATION THAN THIS ONE!"}
{"text":"McDonald's is McDonald's, all over Canada, they're pretty much the same when it comes to their food. The things that would set them apart would be decor, cleanliness, customer service, and play place.  Like most McDonald's, this one has already got their face lift and interior renovations. The more contemporary seating with warmer tones. This one has both tables and booths. Like all Canadian McDonald's, they also have the self ordering kiosks and reduced counter space. A small play place encased entirely by glass is tucked by the washrooms just adjacent of the entrance. Inside a few round tables are available for you to sit and watch your kids. Overflow tables are outside, but adjacent to the play place by the washrooms, the large window panes providing you an unobstructed view for you to keep a watchful eye on your little ones. A nicely laid out plan. 5 stars.  It was lunchtime, and the place was packed! Despite this, I was still able to find a clean table. There was one dining room attendant present and at the ready to clear and clean as patrons left. When there were no tables to clear, the attendant was either sweeping and/or mopping where necessary. I would rate this 5 stars, but my high standards forbid me to let the little things slide. I didn't notice whether or not disposables (paper towels) were used to clean the table. A reusable cloth, while environmentally friendly, will do nothing but smear bacteria from table to table unless it's cleaned after every use. A disposable like paper towel, ensures no such transfer. For now, I'll give it a conditional 5 star since I can't confirm nor deny which one they use here.  The play place is what sets this McDonald's apart from the others, and is what prompted me to come in the first place... my kids. The play place was very condensed, as if designed by packaging Engineers. Minimum space, maximum volume, but that's not what sets this one apart. The apparatus consisted of features that promoted the exercise of many different muscle groups, and my kids have dubbed it \"The Jungle Gym McDonald's\". 5 stars.  This is historical for me, I've never rated any fast food franchise chain more than 4 stars, but I feel that this McDonald's is doing all the right things. The staff is polite and courteous, the place is well staffed and kept clean, and the play place promotes a variety of physical activity. Kudos to the Management here.  Based on how I see things being run, I will give the benefit of doubt for the use of disposable cloths/paper towels for cleaning the dining room tables, and for your efforts I'm giving this McDonald's my first franchise 5-star rating and 16th overall. Congratulations to the entire staff at McDonald's Unionville!  If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds ever!  Waiting in the drive thru 20 yes 20 minutes. The food was all cold. Fries so hard they crunched like potato chips.  This is not the first time either. This franchisor either doesn't care about his business or has no idea what is going on. Either way Yelp isn't enough on this complaint. I intend to call corporate and find out who/what entity owns store 35558.   People need to be fired because these problems are constant.  Or the franchise needs to be pulled."}
{"text":"It's the slowest McDonald's I've ever been to nationwide. Takes 10-15 minutes to get your full meal and the service is pretty bad. The people all talk more to each other, rather than focussing on the order."}
{"text":"I ordered a McNuggets take out. When I opened the box happily, I only got 4 pieces instead of 6. I am like, Why do you cheat on me for nuggets???? So mad  This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been. Never come back again."}
{"text":"Service is kind of rude, the mobile app specials they advertise everywhere are only available weird hours (they're invalid noon to midnight), drink/ketchup dispensers are sometimes down/empty, and to top it off I saw bugs crawling around on the tables on two separate occasions (a fly once, a ladybug another time). The food itself is fine. It's still McDonalds, cheap and open all day and all night, but they really need to step up their game maintaining this place."}
{"text":"I am not the type of person to complain about a restaurant but this has been like the fifth time I've been to this particular McDonald's on Higley and have waited in line for about approximately 10 minutes. The reason why I go to McDonald's is because it's supposed to be fast not necessarily because the food is great. I just waited in line for 12 minutes with only two cars ahead of me... and then got down the road and my Bigmack looked and tasted like it had been under the heat lamp the whole day... I couldn't even eat it - I thought McDonald's had standards? I will not give this particular McDonald's any more chances - I am done being nice and forgiving. I think it's convenient that they don't have a phone number listed on here as well... I was going to call the manager but apparently they don't have the number listed on Google maps."}
{"text":"Not exactly the greatest McDonalds of the bunch. They've messed up my order a couple of times. Also, I've hit them up in the wee hours of the night after work and they're closed, even though there's a large sign on the side of the building saying that their drive-thru is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"We were on our way back from Carowinds and decided to stop off at Mc Donalds on the way to Greensboro. We were hungry and needed to use the facilities, so we decided that McDonalds was the best option. Like another reviewer claimed, yes- this location is about 3mi off the highway. We went inside, and I asked my husband if I should order while he and my daughter used the facilities. He said no, and I'm glad he did. When I entered the bathroom with my daughter, there were three stalls, two of which were out of order. The only working stall didn't have a properly working lock, and I accidently opened the door on some elderly lady (sorry)! That wasn't the worst of it. When we walked in, the bathroom wad infested with flies. Not just a couple, but hundreds of multi-generational flies. It was disgusting. To top it off, the bathroom had one measly trashcan. When I went to throw away something, I stepped on the pedal to open the lid, and was knocked back by the most horrendous stench- someone had thrown out a diaper in the trashcan. Now, being a mom, I know diapers can get stinky, but this was worse than any Diaper Genie stench that I have ever experienced, suggesting that this diaper had been here for a while. Now I have a weak stomach, so it was no suprise that I started dry-heaving. When I got out, my husband said I looked like I had seen a ghost. He said that the fly infestation was equally bad in the men's room. Needless to say, all three of us lost our appetite, and we left the building immediately. Now, let me preface this by saying that I was a manager in the food industry and my husband worked at McDonalds in high school. We have never seen a restaurant, let alone a McDonalds, that was this nasty. If the fly infestation was that bad in the bathrooms without resolve, can you imagine what is going on in the food prep/kitchen area?!  My husband immediately called corporate, and the representative was very helpful and sympathetic. I will also give due props to the regional office, because they did send us an apology letter and vouchers for free meals (though it is not very helpful since we aren't from the area), so I am happy with the corporate response. Futhermore, I know that this particular McDonalds IS NOT representative of McDonalds as a corporation whatsoever, but it does make me think twice about utilizing drive-thrus. This location should be ashamed. I don't know how health inspections work in North Carolina, but I do assist in health inspections in Michigan, and if I saw that kind of infestation locally, I would shut this place down!"}
{"text":"The wait times are my biggest issue. I haven't ever had a problem with the staff or my food but it takes 15 minutes to get a burger in the drive through. It's the same inside as well."}
{"text":"Parking Parking.. I always stay away from this McDonalds on weekends since it is impossible to find parking...  And even if you find one... the agony of dealing with a parking lot deal with all these drivers and shopping carts from Foody's Mart.  The newly renovated interior is really nice though...a lot of seating arrangement for groups, singles and a more private booth area in the front. A fireplace with armchairs??  24 hours drive thru can be so crazy at times!! I guess where else up here for a 3 AM snack attack up here aside from McDonalds?"}
{"text":"By far the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. The restaurant is always filthy dirty. The staff is rude and inept. They never get the order correct and when you call them on it they are unapologetic. Unfortunately people still go there simply because of the name. The management of this location should be ashamed."}
{"text":"It's a McDonald's. the other one was so busy I left and came to this one and honestly I don't expect much when I go so I think they met all my expectations. Appreciate the fact that it wasn't a 30 minute wait like the other one and I got my food quick !"}
{"text":"I went to get a chocolate shake with whipped cream in the drive thru, and it was like a chocolate slushy. I asked the kid if it was supposed to be a milkshake and he said they were having probs with their machine. THEN DONT SERVE SHAKES OF THE MACHINE ISNT WORKING! I called when I got home and spoke to the manager who just said \"sorry\"...I won't be going there again"}
{"text":"Worst service of any McDonald's on the planet...no one even cares so sad!! It took 15 minutes to get food an 10 to get my order taken. This license needs revoked from corporate McDonalds"}
{"text":"I have to say I've been to this location at night and it needs alot of work they always say they are closed when they are not and the workers believe it's about them not the guest. ..wow BUT I've given five stars to your morning crew and the Latina manager she is an amazing and beautiful person...smiles,& always working hard.. she goes out of her way to make her guests are  happy and that is what it is truly about. That really makes your day when someone goes out of their way to please you. I get your fruit parfaits on my days off and clean house(whatever helps get your job done,right? hahaha) ....I can't get them with strawberries because of food allergies and she goes out of her way and makes it  everytime I ask.. That is what customer service is all about going above and beyond to please your guest..I feel bad I don't know her name...I'm gonna be sure to ask next week..Thank you amazing pretty lady:)"}
{"text":"McDonald's needs to jus stop shut all there shit down cuz no matter what u tell them they still manage to screw it up. Even if it's just a regular hamburger they still can't get it right McDonald's is the worst place to get food all of them never been to one that dose anything right they suck at everything they do don understand how they're still m business cuz all they do is mess up I never go there only reason I got food is someone brought it to me I will never spend my money at a McDonald's again"}
{"text":"The store was clean, my order was correct and the free wifi worked quite well as I nibbled away at my Egg McMuffin without getting crumbs in the keyboard. By that point, the coffee had cooled below three billion degrees and I could drink it.  My complaint? The music was WAY too loud and every often there was a new burst of something particularly annoying. I guess it's to keep people from hanging around too often? Well, it worked.  It's a short walk from the light rail station."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for McDonalds, I steer well clear of this location.  Had several bad experiences here well beyond the common problem of forgotten items in the drive-thru.  The workers here are frequently busy doing anything but taking orders and making food, are often rude - chewing gum, abrupt, and generally disinterested.  I understand it's a fast food restaurant and not always a job for life, but take an interest in the customers please - they pay your wages.  The parking lot is frequently disgusting, with McD's litter all over the place.  My wife once had a ghastly salad there with brown lettuc and moldly tomatoes, and when calling management to complain they were dismissive and difficult - although wedid eventually get a free replacement item when we finally returned.  After too many bad experiences I will now drive the extra 10-15 minutes to the next closest location rather than submit myself to the misery of this one."}
{"text":"Brought kids to eat and play with their friends, who were celebrating a birthday. I know it's a McDonalds and my expectations are not high, but one thing I do expect is clean.   The men's room was disgusting. There was feces on the toilet seat and my son couldn't use it as a result. The floors throughout the play area and restaurant were littered with food and spills.   The staff apparently are unable to figure out the purpose of a mop. It sat halfway out of the supply closet the entire time I was there -  nearly two hours. Not once did anyone wipe down tables, leaving it up to customers to sanitize their dining area.   Well below my expectations for the largest restaurant chain on the planet."}
{"text":"Most likely the slowest drive-thru in all of Arizona. Sat in line for almost 20 minutes. With two people taking orders you would think cars would be moving through pretty fast. However it's almost as if half the time there would only be one person taking orders. 5 cars placed their orders before someone even came on the speaker to take my order. If you have no where to be and nothing to do, this might just be the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"The McRib is back! Now I have never had one before so the excitement in my first sentence is one of neither validity nor merit. If you watch The Simpson, you would know that a whole episode was made on a very similar variation of the McRib. So when The Simpsons dedicates a whole episode on the well being of the sandwich and cult-like following, you can't help but try the burger/sandwich out.  So I decided to try out the McRib at the McDonalds located at Atrium on Bay foodcourt. It was lunch time so of course it was packed but this is a good thing. High volume means high turn over.  The food is fresh and made to order as they are simply selling wayy too many big macs, fries and hopefully McRibs. So I ordered the combo and decided against supersizing cause let's be honest... Why get more fries when you can have ttwwwooooo McRibs. =D. Just kidding.  Got my food after a waiting for a couple of minutes and sat with my coworker for lunch. The McRib despite its mass media hype, wasn't very good or special. The combo wasn't cheap and the sandwich felt plain. It was topped with orions and pickles and the rib or \"riblett\" itself kinda tasted like leftover pork roast. The \"riblett\" was also kinda small so there wasn't a lot of it to go around. I do have to say at least it wasn't hard and that it was kinda soft. I guess I can say it was kinda tender, but please do only take that for face value.  Overall, I have to say I'm quiet disappointed with the McRib sandwich. With the hype machine going, maybe I expected a little too much or maybe the sandwich really wasn't that good to begin with. I believe it's the latter. This McD's location is busy so I can't blame it on the low turnover.  I personally would say skip this sandwich. It wasn't worth it for me, how about you? Have to tried the McRib sandwich?"}
{"text":"Great McDonnells to drive threes what can you say about McDonald's it's McDonald's. But the kids love the cookies and shakes. New style is a really great place two drive thru really fast service."}
{"text":"I have been to this McDonalds many times and not once have I had a positive experience. It's right next to our house and I refuse to give them any more of our money or time. I have never sat in a drive through that doesn't have a pretty constant flow...this location just doesn't move, ever! I thought it was just because it was new when it first opened but it's been over a year and not one thing has changed. Go the extra mile to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because I thought they would be quick.  After looking At the line for the drive-thru and seeing it 8 cars long, I saw the line inside and thought that would be the better option.  Boy was I wrong!!!!'  At first there were 2 people taking orders. Then one left to do other things with 6 people in line.    The other cashier was dealing with someone who had just dumped out all their change from underneath the car seat and she was taking forever in counting.  That's CMS education for you!    So 10 minutes late, I get to order.  Three times I have to tell her my order is to go.  At least the food came out quick.  On to the drink machine.  I filled my cup with what was labeled unsweetened tea.  When I got to the car and took a sip, ii found out this was far from unsweetened.  It was diabetes in a cup!  Arghh!    So there are several morals of this story...  Drive thru is faster here even if there are 8 cars in line.  Always taste your tea before pouring a full cup.  And when you think you will get in and out quick, you won't.  And finally, NEVER trust fast food places!!! Ever!!!"}
{"text":"This is McDonald's store# 35044. I say that because I want to be sure this review goes to the right one! As soon as I told my mother that my son (her grandson) and I would be paying her a visit here in Peoria, she said \"You can take me to McDonald's!\"   My mom has Parkinson's disease and is in a nursing home. It was scary for me to imagine taking her out by myself (my son is 9), because she needs a lot of assistance transferring in/out of car to wheelchair. But I made up my mind that I would do it for her and upgraded my rental car to fit her wheelchair in the trunk.   You see, my mom's favorite thing in the whole world is McDonald's french fries with a vanilla shake. Sure, I could have brought it to her, but she wanted to get out. If you haven't been in a nursing home lately, let me remind you that they are depressing.   So here we are and away we went to McDonald's for lunch. But when we got there and I tried to get my mom out of the car and into her wheelchair, things went really wrong. My mom suddenly lost all ability to support her weight and it was all on me, but her wheelchair wasn't under her yet. I lifted and lifted, trying to keep her up while my son tried to get the wheelchair under her. But we were unsuccessful and I had to lower my mom to the ground alongside the car.   I asked my son to \"go inside and ask a uniformed employee to send a strong man out\" to help lift my mother. Well out comes this petite blonde woman named Kaylee (sp?). Without hesitation she jumped into action and the two of us got my mom into the wheelchair in about 30 seconds.   All I can say is Kaylee is my hero. What an awesome person to do this without thinking twice. Because of her, my mom got her fries & shake."}
{"text":"Average McDonald's, came here for lunch after shopping at markville mall.   The food tastes the same as every other McDonald's restaurant.   When I went there were so many flies it was unbelievable. When I went to pick up my tray from the front there was flies crawling around my fries! The employees saw that and gave us new fries.   Also because the restaurant is next to the Asian supermarket the smell of raw fish sweeps through the store every once in a while.   One of the worst McDonald's I've been to, just go to the drive though and eat in your car."}
{"text":"I Have finally had enough of this Terribly managed mcDonalds and today was the Last Straw. I used to go for breakfast there every morning, I stopped doing that. Because this McDonalds has the Slowest service Ive ever seen. You should never have to sit at the Drive-Thru window for any longer than 10 minutes. And they constantly Screw up your orders. Well, TODAY 9/24/2017 was the LAST Straw, I thought Id go in there and get me a lite breakfast and a coffee, I wanted to get my laundry done this morning, So I asked the cashier for a roll of quarters and he refused \"Said he didn't have much left\" I know thats a bunch of B.S. the amount of traffic that goes thru there. So I asked the manager for the same and he acted like it would be such a Hardship to go get a roll from the safe. YOU Guys have NO Idea about Customer Service! You all want more money and higher wages for yourselves, BUT you Won't do a dam thing to help a customer out. So you lost a good paying customer to this location FOREVER! I won't Set foot in that franchise again and if I want McDonalds I will drive to another Store. In fact I have been going to another location for my morning Breakfast and GUESS WHAT? They actually know what the hell there doing and they cook the food better. For some reason the McDonalds on 10847 W.Olive always has dried up hard english muffins on there breakfast sandwiches, and your hash browns are always SO Over cooked there crunchy like potato chips, you order a side of oatmeal and its always a dry lump with no cream, it's never very palatable. and you alway's have to force the food into you, it's really that dull and bland. BUT I never seem to have this problem at other McDonalds. So thats IT The Store at 10847 W. Olive in Peoria is DEAD TO ME! and I will be forwarding this to Corporate as well."}
