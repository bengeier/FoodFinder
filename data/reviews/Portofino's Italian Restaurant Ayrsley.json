{"text":"Portofinos is excellent!  I was very lucky in that I was introduced to portofino's right away when moving down from NYC.  No prolonged search for great Italian food, it's right there at Portofino's! 

I have two words for you: Stuffed Eggplant.  This dish haunts my dreams and my mouth will water out of the blue for it.  

I'm gonna have to stop in and get some after this review ."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for takeout the other night and was very disappointed. I usually love their pizza but not this time. This time, the  crust on the bottom was so burnt that it was the only thing you tasted. I'm surprised that the would actually give it to a customer knowing that it was burnt do badly. We ate it because we didn't want to waste food but it was the worst pizza I have eaten from there.  I'm hoping that this was just a fluke and that the next one we order will be more to our liking."}
{"text":"Came at 6pm, maybe 4 tables, sat for 20 minutes with no server contact. Walked out past 3 servers chatting."}
{"text":"Eh. Being from NY an being Italian this place is nothing special. Service is okay. Food seems engeric something I could easily make at my house. Ordered some wine an it seemed...stale. probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic cuisine. Enrique was the best server-made us feel like we were in Italy.   The owner is originally from Naples and tries to make the food as authentic as possible."}
{"text":"We ate here last night for dinner, and were pleasantly surprised with this restaurant all around. The service was excellent, from the moment we entered to the moment we left. Everyone greeted us and everyone was extremely friendly! Our waiter Ash was great, he was quick to take our order and always there if we needed anything. We started with the bruschetta for an appetizer, very good. Then my husband ordered the veal parmigiana while I ordered the Montese pizza. Both were wonderful and great portions! There was a decent amount of prosciutto on the pizza, which was great because a lot of places tend to skimp on this topping. I typically make my own at home to get what I want since it's my favorite, but now I have a place to go to get exactly what I want. We definitely found a place that will be one of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn mediocre to be honest. I ordered the lobster ravioli and it came to me garnished with grated cheese like the stuff from a plastic container that you put on pizza. I'm sorry, but if you are serving me a $25 pasta plate, put fresh parm on it or nothing at all. The ravioli was crunchy almost like the lobster had sand in it. The sangria tasted like juice. The service was nice though. Other than that, will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Ordered the lasagna and it was delicious the size was incredible. It was huge. Biggest that I have had that was at restaurant.  Flavor was a little lacking in the pop department but that is the only negative that I have. Great place to eat. Good selection of brews at the bar too. I will come back."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews as we have been here several times and love the food however their service lately has been less than acceptable. and last evening was just one more example. We arrived and were seated promptly no issue.  However we sat approximatley 5 minutes with servers walking past us and no one yet even acknowleding we were there and we were right in the middle of the aisle not back in a corner somewhere.  A table was seated next to us and after us had already had there server greet them and beverage order taken, still there we sat.  Finally as I sat there tapping my fingers on the table and looking less then amused the hostess took notice and mentioned to our server and pointed to our table - Now he may have noticed on his own if he wasn't standing at the bar watching the soccer game on TV.  

Unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened at this particular location.  While I like the food here not sure that I will return as this seems to be a consistent issue and there are much better restaurants with MUCH better service."}
{"text":"Arrived 30 minutes before scheduled closing time. Walked in and they said they closed early because not enough business. If their business is not enough to keep their advertised schedule then maybe schedule should be altered. Bad business practice."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times. Always have the veal sub. It's very good. It's hard to find good veal in the south but they have it. They make me a veal parm with sauteed green peppers on it. Fantastic. Just like up north. Perfect size for lunch. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"The parking area for this restaurant is really small. It's made even worse right now by construction at a neighboring building taking up valuable parking spaces. Wondering why every time we eat at Portofinos we have to circle the lot for 15 minutes passing by the owners car which is always parked in the best parking space closest to his own front door? Gnapoli....move your car!!! (See the photo attached to a customer review from 2012 for evidence!)"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Stopped in to grab a salad and slice for lunch. Very prompt service, nice big side salad with great house dressing. They even heated up the pizza. Probably the best pizza I have had outside of NYC."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here a couple of weeks ago. We had a veggie pizza. It was delicious, some of the best pizza I've ever had! The service was fantastic as well. It was quiet and very clean, and the food got to us quickly. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ya know I don't know what some people expect but this was a great dinner service was exceptional and prices were reasonable . We both had seafood dishes and they were fresh and well prepared .  I would go here any time."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for Italian food in the Queen City. I was born in Brooklyn, NY, and every time my mother visits, she insists we go to Portofino's at least once. The service is fantastic and the food is authentic Italian (again, that's coming from the mouth of a New Yorker!). The Chicken Parm is my go-to dish -- my ultimate comfort food. Overall, I'd highly recommend this spot if you're in need of good food. Period."}
{"text":"Portofino's was able to accommodate a party of 10 of us with fairly short notice. The service was efficient and anticipatory...for instance, before my drink was gone, a new one appeared in front of me. The server split our tab which is a huge deal when you're out with a large group like ours. Finally, the food was tasty and the portions were generous. I liked the bruschetta very much."}
{"text":"Have eaten there several times.  Food has been great.  Be careful of the specials.  Waiter will not give you a price unless you ask.  Made the mistake of ordering the special pork chop without asking the price.  The cost was $27.00 for a single pork chop!!!  Sides were more that a human could eat but not worth taking home and not worth the additional price.  Regular items on the menu are competively priced."}
{"text":"I would not call this good Italian food based off this experience and will not return to give it another try. 

We started when Tomato Caprese Salad...good basil and Mozzarella but the tomatoes had no flavor and were hard (it is Tomato season so no excuse)     

My husband had the Futti Di Mari and all the seafood was overcook...which made it rubbery

I had Gnocchi with a meatball that tasted like Chef Boyardee. 

The best part of the meal was the bread."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meat balls was watery and tasteless.  
This reminds me of the most memorable American imagery and cinema showcase the classic Italian dish of spaghetti and sauce as a mound of plain, undressed cooked pasta noodles mounded high on a dish, then topped with a ladleful.  Though this is very iconic of American Italian cuisine, a dish of pasta served in this manner in Italy would be disaster.
In authentic Italian cuisine, the pasta sauce is always incorporated into the pasta before serving."}
{"text":"Wow!  Please stay far away from this establishment if you have any food allergies.  They will RIP-YOU-OFF AND PRICE GAUGE YOU!  Tonight, I went to have dinner.  I asked all the right questions about being Gluten and Dairy Free.  The waitress was completely illiterate about the composition and the ingredients of the meal.  Not once did she offer to walk-in the kitchen and ask the chef.  A very nice man-older, stepped in and explained they can make any chicken dish grilled and add the sauce.  Never once did they state if would be an up-charge of $5.00.  My meal arrived and it was 1/4 cup of gluten-free pasta and one thin cutlet of chicken, less than 4 ounces.  There were no vegetables at all.  The chicken was dry and over-cooked.  There was no seasoning at all.  I was starving, so I ate my very small portion of food.  When the bill arrived, I was charged $19.50 for my meal.  I think I fell off my chair. 

Food Cost Break-Down-
1 box of Gluten-Free Pasta ($1.89) and 1 breast of chicken 4 ounces-$6.99 lb at Whole Foods.  Usually you receive 2 full breast( 4 cutlets)- Total Value of Meal: $ 4.00.

I went to the front desk and she sent me over to the owner.  I explained to him that I was never told about the up-charge or even the very expensive meal that I was about to be charged for.  He stated \"Gluten-Free Pasta\" is very expensive.  Is this an excuse to lie to a customer.  Does he not realize when you ask for \"Gluten Free\" that you are aware of your allergy and you are aware of the cost of food.  I do go food shopping every week for the last 9 years.  He just was rude and said he would adjust the bill.  The waitress came back with a check for $18.50 for my meal. He took $1.00 off.   This was deplorable and disgusting.  You mark your food cost up over 90%.  Shame on You!!!

You had the opportunity to fix it as the owner and you choose to coat your pockets with my hard earned money.  You are awful man!  I hope everyone who reads this will boycott your restaurant.  You are greedy and your food was AWFUL!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! PIZZA and food are excellent, fair prices....and the BEST home made salad dressing EVER...... period!!! Also.....get the canoli......fantastic! This is my go to pizza place in Steel Creek area."}
{"text":"Was given name by our hotel.  Good service and food was descent.  Had chicken saltimbocca, which was moist and huge serving.  Couldn't eat all!  Served with a crusty Italian bread that was warm and very good.  Other food ordered was lasagna, and noodles were kind of soft almost over cooked.  Pizza which was a flat New York style and very good as well.  Salads were a good variety of vegetables.  Beware regular Italian dressing was mostly vinegar!  Prices were good.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST place to get a pizza in this area! Reasonably priced and made fresh to order. Their large cheese pie cannot be beat. The guys that run this place are from Italy and they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Waitstaff was terrible. Ordered vodka martini. Was asked if I wanted grey goose and I said no just house vodka. Was charged for grey goose and waitress says grey goose is our house vodka after the fact.  Waitress questioned others in my group that they didn't know what went into a drink. I ordered veil piccata and it was the thickest toughest veal piccata I've ever had. Menu also said it came in lemon butter sauce with angel hair pasta and yet the pasta came with marinara all over it. Not impressed at all! And they started stacking up chairs on tables behind us 30 min before it was apparently closing time."}
{"text":"I've eaten quite a bit of food from this Portofino's location.  I tried the pizza for the first time the other day and I think that will be my go-to menu item at this place because it is excellent.

The other dishes they serve are usually good too: the bread is warm and delicious and they load tons of cheese onto their dishes.  It isn't the healthiest place.  There are not many great dining options in the nearby area, but I would say that this is one of the better options in the neighborhood.  

The only problem I have encountered there is when I tried to place a takeout order via phone.  I was ordering for 3 people and the individual I was speaking to was not repeating the order back correctly (we went through it a couple of times and I asked if there was someone else that could take my order and they either didn't understand me or didn't want someone else to take my order??).  I decided it would be easier to go to the restaurant and just order live, but the order still came out wrong.  I got them to correct and switch it out, but I had to wait a little longer than I would have liked.  They were semi-friendly about it and apologetic when it came out wrong.  I just wanted dressing on the side and a salad without olives..."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but took friends there last night bragging about how good it was n was so very disappointed. Our waitress was nice but we could hardly understand her English. We had to ask her to repeat everything several times. She didn't seem to be properly trained bringing out one dish wrong n didn't know the prices of the special's. Then the food came, my soup was watery n tasteless. My veal was rubbery n the whole dish was bland. My husband's seafood dish was so just ok n the friends orders were all messed up which she did not offer to correct. We were embarrassed to say the least after telling them how great this place was. Won't go back now."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, pasta, and chicken parm subs! Good wine selection and excellent service. Try the shrimp parmigiana paired with a merlot or Malbec."}
{"text":"First time and ordered my #1 meal to judge if I'll return. Veal Piccata.   It was as good as it gets.   Thick cut from the leg.   Nice lemon sauce.  Not overpowering.  Full of capers and mushrooms.  Scott the bartender was tops.  Everything I asked for was provided.    Hot bread came with butter but getting olive oil just requires asking.  I'll be back next week to try my #2. Baked Gnocchi."}
{"text":"Simply awesome!  We've dined here a number of times over the past 4 years and consistency of the food, service and value are key elements to our satisfaction.  Great job Portofino's team!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but not too stuffy, good for a date or the family.  I had the Alla Panna pasta.  The sauce (alfredo style) was the perfect combination of rich and creamy!  Great cannolis too!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Portofino's for date night on Friday. I was looking for a good option near Pineville for Italian food; Portofino's did not disappoint. 

I always take it as an encouraging sign when I can easily find a half dozen options on a menu that I'd readily choose to eat. It was not hard to imagine myself fabricating reasons to come back for lunch and/or dinner again.

We started dinner with stuffed mushrooms filled with crabmeat. A perfectly yummy way to start dinner.

My wife ordered the special for that evening -- grilled Mahi Mahi on risotto with pesto sauce. I ordered Fettuccine Mediteraneo (mixed seafood in a pink creamy sauce). Mine also came with plenty of mussels in the shell. Both dishes came with an amply sized dinner salad. The serving sizes for both dishes were huge (we had plenty to take home). Both dishes were scrumptious that evening and even better the next day as leftovers.

My wife and I each ordered glasses of Lambrusco, which was a perfect complement to our meal. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We only tried a large plain pie, but it was worth coming back for. Perfect thin crust, non-greasy cheese, and the SAUCE was amazing - salty and sweet, just perfect. We just moved down to Charlotte from the NYC metro area, and this is the real deal. I met the owner and he said he worked all over north/central NJ, so we definitely felt right at home here."}
{"text":"I dined on-site for the first time a week ago. If you've never been in this area, you should realize that it's located in a popular and heavily-trafficked shopping village--it may be hard for you to find a parking spot. Anyways, I was part of a party of 2, and was seated quickly on a Friday during the lunch rush. My friend whom I went with was someone straight-outta-Italy. She ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the Bolognese (spaghetti with meat sauce). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive-- he made me realize how much I drank, because in the short hour we were there, he refilled my soda 3-4 times! My bolognese was soooooooo darn good. It was MEMORABLE good. It was so good that I would go out of my lazy way just to come here to eat it again. It made me realize how a simple dish of pasta with ground beef and tomato sauce can hit that special spot. Now I can't stop thinking about it. I actually ordered the same dish from the Portofino's in Park Road, but it wasn't the same. Maybe it was because I got it to-go, I'm not sure. But, I will always remember that spaghetti dish in this location as one of the best spaghetti meals I've ever had. (P.S. my Italian friend also said her dish was very good-- it wasn't just me)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing lunch. Both of us ordered lunch specials and both of us left hungry. I had a lobster ravioli that was inundated with sauce. Not tasty at all. Even the premeal bread tasted a day old. I would feel bad feeding the leftovers to my dog."}
{"text":"Awful.

The food here is truly awful. There are no other words. Well there are plenty of words, but none are good. My Chicken Parm was actually watery. The house wine tasted terrible.

Read more here. http://eatitcharlotte.com/2017/01/15/portofinos-italian-restaurant-ayrsley/"}
{"text":"The Stromboli is doughy (undercooked)in the middle both times we ordered it. The pizza is always messed up with cheese all over the place which leaves slices with no cheese or too much. The wait staff is great, but the food and management (manager has been rude on multiple occasions) is subpar. The only reason we have ordered from there more than once is because it is walking distance from our town home."}
{"text":"My dinner was delicious. Visiting from California and friend recommended this place. Martinis were good. Appetizer was good. I ordered the Frutti de Mare. So good!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza i have had in North Carolina. But it does not get 5 stars because that's the only thing i will ever have there. The dinners and appetizers are very sub-par that i could bring this rating down to even 2 stars but because the pizza is that good, it remains at 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food is not the issue. My low 3 Star is way beyond generous. This is my second visit within a month as the first one was right after my big event with 8 other friends. That was 2 and a half weeks ago. This was a special night, so I expected that the waiter would have been professional and take good care of us. He didn't. He was totally unprofessional. Trying to \"sell\" my friends and me food by passing by other people's plate? While interrupting conversations and worst part is, that is someone else's food from another table!!! How is that okay? You're bringing it over to us to \"sell\" or advertise like that is sooooo soooo unbecoming!

Then there was today. I have to admit I always give people a second chance. So, true to myself, I decide to keep an open mind. Well well well.... what do you know? Same waiter! Ooooh dearie me!!!!

He comes over, takes our order. Then comes back much much later with a plate that looks like something my friend had ordered and we saw him take it to the table right next to us!!!!!!!   I was disgusted... utterly ashamed and wished I had not suggested this place to my friend - ugh!
He comes back, plate in hand, looks at us both and says \"just some short selling there!\"

In any case, like I said, good food, disgusting manners, won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet! 

I met a friend for lunch and the place was pretty empty. Our waiter was Enrique and he was fantastic! He was very attentive, our glasses were never empty, offered great menu selections and brought out several baskets of warm bread! Awesome!

I went with one of their specials it was spinach ravioli, with chicken in a gorgonzola sauce. It was so good! I would definitely order it again! 

I'll likely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I were I  town for a family reunion. I usually come to Charlotte often, but stay on the other side of town. It was about 10pm and we were starving,  as we had just come off the road. We looked online for restaurants and came across Portofino's. Being northerners, we were skeptical, but ordered a large pie. O-M-G!!! It was delish! To make matters worse, when we picked up our puzza,they had a display case of enticing Italian desserts, and my sister and I indulged in a limoncello and a sorbet. It was delectable!!! The food was amazing. Check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First, read my review for Providence Road location.......well, only if you want to do so!

After eating at Providence Road locale on Monday, and although my lovely daughter ( a Charlotte resident) advised us that the sauce here tends to be watery, honey was insistent on returning to this location since the white pizza of his dreams hailed from Ayrsley!  

As others have mentioned, parking may be an issue if you are not there pretty early. 

Nicer ambiance than Providence Road, but for us it is ALL about the food.
Server was Chantel, very pleasant.  Almost as good as Stafford at Providence Road.  

The bread was OMG good.  No burnt bottoms this night!  We both started with the Caesar salad.  Good BUT not sure if the owner has tried to Americanize it or what, but NO parmesan cheese......mozzarella....really?  But the dressing was great, the croutons were plentiful (although I didn't think they were house made, which would have been a plus based on that heavenly manna).

Honey stuck with the Zuppa di Pesce based on the Providence Road experience.  First problem for him was NO rigatoni, although available at the other location.  Lovely daughter had warned us that she and the hubs had almost quit this location for the Park Road one (we didn't eat there.....yet!) due to what she thought was watered down sauce.  As soon as honey's dish was set in front of him, we realized the problem......pasta basically not drained!  I wish I had taken a picture, because there was a swimming pool below his food.  Sauce was just meh (as Yelp puts it). I did take one shrimp, didn't even care to get the others.  Even after tilting his plate and pouring water into the bowl meant for shells half full of water, there was still water.  He had to make do with penne, or ziti, heck, I'm not sure, but there was about a pound of THAT!  

On to me!  I ordered the Stuffed Eggplant which did NOT come with what I consider the staple of every Italian meal, pasta.  However, I was only able to finish half my plate.  This is their version of Eggplant Rollatini, kinda, sorta.  It comes with that same ham from the chicken of Monday night, so I got spinach......now that was some good stuff!  I notice another reviewer says it haunts her dreams!  I can understand.  Strangely, MY red sauce was great.  So, I cannot understand why the honey's sauce on his dish was so blah.....oh, it was that gallon of water!  

Again, he got a cannoli (he managed to skip the spumoni and espresso this trip!), and was not as happy with it.  The reason, you ask?  Because they tried to chef it up.  This fellow just wants a cannoli with the filling....he doesn't need a decorated plate drizzled with a ton of Hershey's syrup!  

I will mention that the white pizza from heaven came from this locale last year, so he may be willing to order pizza from here!  He walked outside to enjoy the sun while I visited the facilities.......so I mentioned on my way out to what appeared to be a manager that the staff might want to drain the pasta.  She was pleasant BUT said we would need to mention it.  Now, I'm a little confused......having complaints of watered down sauces, and we might need to mention draining the pasta?  Oh, well....Providence Road and Stafford for our server for the win!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we have better Portofino's in Greenville. We were hoping for the same dining experience considering it is located in Charlotte. The service was good but the food was not as good as the one we get in Greenville. The dinner rolls was just bread sliced with butter for us to smear instead of the mouth watering dinner rolls dipped in garlic and olive oil. I ordered for Shrimp Fradiavolo and hubby went for Chicken Marsala. My entree was good but Chicken marsala was just bland. Next time we are Charlotte we are going to try other Italian places for sure."}
{"text":"A good spot when you are craving Italian. They have a wide variety of Italian favorites. I like the gorgonzola tortellini and any of their pizzas. I don't really care for their salad. The soup I had was a bit salty and reminded me of something out of a can. The white sangria is much better than the red.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times as I work right down the street. The first couple of times were nothing greater than the local Olive Garden but the last time I ate here I ordered Fettuccine with Italian Sausage in a Garlic butter sauce. What I got was a very cheap impostor of Fettuccine with about 7 cloves of chopped garlic and no Sausage. In the same order my coworker did not receive the mushrooms she requested in her meal either despite having the waiter repeat the order back to her. Needless to say, this was my last time eating here."}
{"text":"Just so-so.  I had the mussels marinara with a salad and the tomato sauce was extremely acidic and slightly sour tasting.  Salad was large and pretty good. I think the thing here is large portion sizes.  I didn't try the pizza, which seams to be what most people rave about.  Based on the food I had this time, I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Went here recently to try it for the first time for dinner and was disappointed. 
We ordered the clams with white sauce and eggplant parmigiana. When the food arrived, my eggplant appeared very nice, good cheese melt and good amount that filled the plate. I could smell the clams from across the table. Now, I don't eat many clams but I had said that they better be careful if they eat all those...they smelled rotten! I was told it tasted about as good as it smelled unfortunately. As far as the eggplant parm, it wasn't very warm or tasty so I would best describe this as better quantity over quality.
We hope to give this place another chance, maybe the pizza is what we should be coming here for."}
{"text":"Only because of Hurricane Matthew we found ourselves in Charlotte/Ayrsley.
We were pleasantly surprised after so many so so reviews. Maybe those peeps had a bad day but I have to say all our dishes were excellent.

I wanted veal and took the advice of our waiter and had the veal with artichokes and shiitake mushrooms with garlic and oil. I can eat a whole cow so when I say the portions are big believe me! Very affordable and the meal comes with spaghetti and a salad or soup. Great value and the wine prices were reasonable as well.

A very friendly place where you feel like family. My suggestion would be to offer a house wine in a carafe. 

Other dishes ordered at the table were veal parm and eggplant parm both great dishes.I am use to a thinner cut of veal (pounded) but their veal was cooked perfectly and was very tender.

The pizza looked good as well. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my this was some very tasty italian food.  we walked right in were seated right away and the place rapidly filled up with patrons.  I had a shrimp 4 cheese fettuccine, DH had a margharita pizza sp.with a house Chianti  all was excellent. fresh tasty and we will be back.
JUST GET THERE EARLY FOR A SEAT WITH OUT A WAIT!!  GREAT STAFF"}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is nice and courteous and knowledgeable and great. Their food it really go and better than the chain Italian restaurant with the word garden. You leave there full. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"For me, if the service is good, I can forgive bad food, but both were poor. The host and our waiter treated us like a waste of their time although our whole party ordered full entrees. Just very rude and the food in no way redeemed it. I&#39;m hesitant to say, but judging by how kindly they treated the other (white) patrons and blatantly disregarded my party of all mixed races, there may be prejudice... The only items we liked were the bread and Basil tomato Italian dressing. The ground beef sauces such as in the Bolognese and lasagna had an out of the can bland taste. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to several of the Portofinos in Charlotte including Park Road, Eastway Drive, and Arboretum.  So, when we found ourselves in the Arsley area, we thought this would be a good place to stop. Prior to arriving, we called to make sure they were open for lunch.  The guy who answered the phone was abrupt and almost rude.  Not a good sign, but I ignored it and we proceeded to go.  

Overall, I would say this location is not as good as Eastway or Arborteum.  I think the service was not as good, and the food I ordered wasn't as good either.  Since it was lunch time and I wasn't that hungry, I decided to go for a salad and a slice of cheese pizza.  Both were ok, but nothing especially exciting. 

Still, it is not a bad choice for the area. I just wouldn't go out of my way to drive to this location."}
{"text":"I was brought to another one of Portofino's locations by a New York Italian, so I knew this had to be good.  Lucky for me, there is this location right in my own neighborhood!  I pass by it every day, and it wasn't until last night that I finally decided to try it.

If you've ever been in Ayrsley Town, it seems to be pretty dead for the most part.  So, I was pretty surprised to come on a Friday night and there actually be a wait to be seated!  The place was full!  Luckily, it was only a 5-10 minute wait and the bartended was friendly and asked us if we wanted to order drinks.  FYI, the sangria is yum.  Yes, yum.

Once we were seated, a friendly and upbeat waitress with a Hello Kitty-esque bow in her hair came to take our orders.  I knew it was going to be too much food, but my husband and I each ordered an entree anyway, to be able to get a sense of how the food was.  Together, we ordered the baked lasagna, chicken tortellini, french onion soup, caesar salad and a cannoli to top it all off.

Needless to say, it was all delish and the portions were true to Italian family style.  I woke up early this morning just so I could eat some of the leftovers before my husband wakes up ;)

My only note of constructive feedback is to say the baked lasagna wasn't piping hot when we got it, leading us to believe it isn't made to order, but nothing a little microwaving can't fix for the next day!"}
{"text":"Though this place is a chain it totally has the ambiance down pat! Always nice to have a Italian spot nearby"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Been going there for years and always excellent but something wasn't quite the same.  Had clams casino and that was excellent. Bread was old and hard not freshly baked.  Had to ask for olive oil.  Lentil soup ok, nothing special.  Chicken gorgonzola - sauce was great  but chicken was grizzly and overcooked.  Friend had veal marsala which was excellent."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and leaves much to be desired.  Sauce was watery and bland, no flavor at all.  The meatballs aren't even homemade.  Such a disappointment.  And I'm still confused as to why the put mozzarella on their Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Overall, it was an average experience. Wait staff was good. The salad was rather bland. My chicken parmigana was decent, but nothing special. We are staying at a hotel nearby and it was convenient enough."}
{"text":"I really like Portifino's.  It's a nice italian restaurant and I've never been dissapointed when I've left there.  They have New York style pizza that's baked in a brick over.  It's mighty tasty.  I've also had the philly cheesesteak there and it was good.  Not like Philly but decent for not being in Philly.

This place is great to eat at before catching a movie at Arysely Theaters."}
{"text":"I traveled to Charlotte on business and this was one of the local restaurants near the hotel we stayed at in the Ayrsley area. I went at lunch time on a week day and I was quickly seated. The service was great, the waitress greeted me immediately and gave me her recommendations. One negative things was the bread they serve--it was a little hard on the bottom, so i had to pull the bottom off and eat around it. I ordered a pizza, and it was one of the best fresh made pizza's I have had in a while. The ingrediants were really good and the waitress informed me they make their own marinara sauce and dough.The place is cute for small families or a date but I wouldn't recommend large groups. I would recommend this Restaurant to others, and I will travel back when I am looking for a good pizza!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place, their pasta is one of my favorites.
This time we were in 6 celebrating my cousin birthday! 
We ordered mozzarella sticks, pepperoni pizza and lasagna.
The waitress was very attentive, she was always checking on us, refilling our drinks and bringing us more bread. 
Their bread is so delicious and fresh, we were lucky to get bread straight from the oven.
Their mozzarella sticks are my favorite so far!
They have a lot of options to choose from and everything that I ever had there is great. My favorite dish is eggplant parmigiana but this time I went with lasagna. The portion is so big that I shared with my mother in law and I even brought leftovers home. The other 4 people shared the pepperoni pizza that was huge and we also had leftovers.
When the cake came all the waitress/waiter came to sing happy birthday.
The only thing that they need to improve asap is the time that they take to prepare the meal.
The place was busy but not packed enough for them to take so long to get our food ready."}
{"text":"So I have reviewed the Arboretum location with 3 stars but this location gets 4!! At this location I can get the gnocchi romano which I LOVE!! Is it the best gnocchi I've ever had no but it's just comforting. When I'm having a really bad day at work sometimes I will treat myself to the gnocchi for lunch. My work is right there so it's easy for me to pick up. We also use them for office pizza orders and the guys really seem to enjoy it. The people working at this location are awesome especially the owners and they are always accommodating. Super great guys :) 

It just kind of makes me feel like I'm eating food that a friends mom cooked. It has that comfort quality so that's why they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Chicken Marsala.  My husband had the Veal and both lacked flavor.  Tiramisu - not yummy!  We will continue to look for a good, Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for an early lunch one day. My waitress was super friendly. Ordered a martini and it was great (kudos to the bartender). I ordered chicken parmigiana, would love to explore more of the menu. My friend told me that they sell items that aren't listed on the menu like Philly cheesesteaks, as a first time customer I wish I would've been advised of this \"secret menu\". I will return though."}
{"text":"The pizza was very subpar. Not inedible, just probably not as satisfying as a Dominos or Papa Johns. It was empty at 8:30 on a Tuesday. The host kept addressing me in Spanish, as if any foreign language was \"exotic\".  I sat at the bar at first-- the bartender was serving another couple but didn't acknowledge me. After 10 minutes, got sat at a table to get served, unfortunately it was a booth right next to the computer where they ring things in. Had to listen to one guy complaining about this from foreigners and another about it how slow things were. Tabasco sauce was 7 months old and pale.  Anything more would be nitpicking I suppose.  

TLDR: subpar food, poorly managed"}
{"text":"Portifino's has some of the best NY style pizza around. Thin but loaded with flavor just like it should be. I have tried several of their pasta dishes and they are very good too. They have a really good tomato salad dressing that is creamy and has just the right amount of flavor.This is a quaint little place tucked in Ayrsley in SW Charlotte, and they are a good choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Whoa, Portofino's, what happened?  I had not eaten at his (or any other location) in at least a year, but this place is not as good as it once was.

They used to bring out great soft warm fresh bread.  The 3 loaves of bread they brought out for our group of 8 were all charred.  A co-worker got the canneloni - it looked good until she took a couple of bites of one of the two pieces and it was cold in the middle.  It was like it had been refrigerated or frozen and just reheated :(  I can do better than that by getting frozen pasta at Sam's Club and for a whole cheaper.  They brought it back but all they did was dump a lot of warm sauce on it so it was still cold in the middle.  Another coworker ordered chicken with her pasta (which all of us heard) and they did not put it on. A small lunch salad now costs an extra $2.50 when served with an entree when not that long ago it was $1.  I understand the need to raise prices due to food costs, but this is mostly lettuce here, plus it's also an add-on. Our waitress was nice, but we were there for 90 minutes and our waters were refilled only once.  They also added on 18% for mediocre service so that was another disappointment.

There were a couple of positives.  My tortellini with chicken and Gorgonzola was pretty tasty, as were my coworkers' pizza and grilled chicken salad.  They gave my co-worker a surprise tiramisu because they felt bad about her canneloni.  Unfortunately, she doesn't like the taste of coffee, so she didn't eat it.    The overall experience was definitely \"meh\" so it will likely be a while before I give it another shot.  I feel a little bad, because almost everyone there seems nice, but the food and service have to improve a little bit."}
{"text":"Figured I'd try an Italian restaurant close to where I live. Now I may be a little biased because I grew up in an Italian family and ate homemade Italian food from my family along with my own cooking. The atmosphere when sitting down was okay, service was quick and the waitress was very nice. The food was subpar for me. I ordered gnocchi baked with mozzarella cheese and a meatball. The sauce tasted like chopped tomatoes that were overly seasoned. Don't even get me started on the meatball. It tasted like a mushy, bland bowel movement my dog may leave in the backyard. To me, this place has typical southern Italian taste and I have yet to find an Italian restaurant like I grew up with. I give it three stars for the service, but 1 for the food. If you're thinking about going here, I'd look elsewhere. Probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I've been eating at Portofino's for over 10 years. Their pizza is phenomenal and I have never had a bad meal.  The best northern-US style Italian place I've found in Charlotte. Even their cheesesteaks are great."}
{"text":"I have been living in arysley for 5 years, and Portofinos has been our go to Italian spot. In the past 2-3 months the quality of food,price and presentation has gone down quite a bit. 

We got a chicken margarita pizza which is soupy and the toppings come right off. We also go mozzarella sticks that are so hard!"}
{"text":"Our first time was our last time!

I honestly don't know how they remove all flavor from the food. The wood fired pizza literally had no taste, and the shrimp scampi had almost no sauce and even less taste. They do try to be clever with their food though. Outside the box thinking leads to shredded mozzarella cheese on the Caesar salad.

Perhaps my taste buds went on vacation without me but I won't be back to determine whether this was just an off night."}
{"text":"We ate there last night and was recommended by the hotel we were staying at.  Overall the food was very bland and drowning in sauce and the chicken was very dry. If your visiting carowinds or here on other business, there are plenty of other options around."}
{"text":"My friend and I dinned at Portofino's yesterday on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It was my first experience at the Italian eatery. 

A couple near us complained to the waitress that since the lady's entrée never came out, despite the gentleman had finished his entrée; they were cancelling the entrée and requesting the check.   The waitress apologized and issued the gentleman the check.  He paid and just as they were getting up to leave, the waitress hurried over and said that she had forgotten to charge them for the accompanying side salad that the lady had apparently eaten, which comes with the entrée.  The lady went ballistic on the waitress saying \"Are you crazy, you want to charge me for the salad that comes with the entrée that you never brought me?!\"  As the couple walked out (without paying for the salad), the waitress charged after them with a few words of her own (out of my earshot, despite my best efforts...LOL).  It was like watching a show with our dinner...quiet entertaining. 

We had the same waitress.  I don't think she was able to recover from the other incident.  We had asked for warm bread since the loaf she brought out was delivered cold, which took so long that we asked another waitress for the bread.  Our entrée took a very long time too as did a nearby couple who was there before us.  A third couple, serviced by the same waitress had waited at least 10 minutes before they asked another waitress to take their drink order.  There were only three other tables of dinners on our side.  I'm not sure how many were on the other side of the divided restaurant.  However, service that day was not the best.

Now to the food!  I ordered the chicken in Gorgonzola sauce with mushrooms and garlic.  Now that sounds like a very flavorful dish, doesn't it?  Imagine my disappointment when I had to douse it with salt and pepper two or three times throughout the meal.  My sweetie had Chicken Carbonara.  Before he tasted his dish, I passed him the salt and pepper and he said, \"Oh really, it's like that?\" and re-seasoning his food too (as did another nearby diner).  Neither of us are big salters.  The chicken in both of our dishes was a bit tough and just really lacked \"oomph\".  On the upside, the portions were huge (If only you wanted to take them home.).  We both rated the food as 2  1/2 to 3 stars.  Hey, maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen and THE waitress (or maybe not)."}
{"text":"Call me a Northeast snob but this place is just terrible. Had the lasagna. I've had bad lasagna before and great lasagna but this was just an embarrassment to lasagna in general. This was so bad it can't even be classified as lasagna. Let me tell you, if I can't even distinguish where the pasta ends from where the puddle of sauce and melted cheese begins, then this isn't a piece of lasagna. It's a damn bowl of red sauce soup. A slop of loose meat with no flavor drowning in a wardrobe of soggy pasta and anchored by far too much cheese. A recommendation for this dish (and the calzone and other pasta dishes on the menu) LESS IS MORE. I'm serious. Now I'm not expecting some artisan revival paying homage to the cultural nuances of northern Italian cuisine but FFS, cut back on the sauce, cut back on the cheese and just understand that nothing about this dish was remotely appealing. I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you this. I'm sorry for maybe not knowing the clientele. I'm sorry for making you throw out so much. But in all honesty, you should be apologizing to the customers for bringing them such a meal. Nice location, ambience was Ok. Staff was quick, friendly and experienced. Less is more, trust me."}
{"text":"The location is in a nice area and it's a well done place. Walking in you get the impression it's going to be a good time and then it all went south.

We sat at our table for at least 10 - 15 minutes with no one checking on us then the server showed up smelling like she had just smoked a carton with Joe Camel. She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me \"fries with that\"....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.

Placed our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. 

Our order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.

Again the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing. 

So on the way out the door I mentioned this to the \"manager\" and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service. I drop over $20 per person and all the guy could say was he would look into it. 

Won't be going back ever. There is a problem there and they don't care to fix it so I won't be back. I was warned before I went and didn't listen."}
{"text":"Let's start when the four of us walked in, the hostess looked at us and walked away to the corner and started talking to for other employees we had to ask if someone could help us. When we sat down we ordered wine and they said they would bring bread to the table. There were four adults and they bring one small piece of bread and some pats of butter. we ordered the Chianti and it was very poor quality. I would have expected a better wine. Finally we ordered our meals. there was lasagna calamari lobster ravioli and all of it was very bland and not very good. I would not suggest this place for anyone to visit it used to be really good but that was a few years ago. It seems the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst! The food was terrible. The waitress was pleasant and polite but clueless. We were extremely pissed when we left. I wouldn't give my dogs food from here. After we complained no manager at anytime came over to speak with us. This place is an absolute disgrace. We paid the bill and left and we didn't even eat the food. 
I must say this. Please don't let this location stop you from the other Portofino's. We frequent the one in the Arboretum and it's excellent."}
{"text":"Water was nasty, lemon couldn't help it! 
Chicken Alfredo taste like they didn't season the chicken at all! Pizza was only thing that was ok. I will not be returning to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks ago. Service was on point. VERY large menu. If you can't find what you like, I am sure if you ask, they can make. Lots of choices and all of the typical selections you would expect to at an Italian restaurant. Portions are huge and you will definitely have leftovers. I enjoyed the salad that came with my meal. I ordered the Chicken Portobello-it was ok, nothing special about the sauce and kind of on the bland side. Overall, I'd say an average Italian place at best, better than the chains that might come to mind."}
{"text":"This entire place horrible from being sat by the hostess to the bread and ending with meal. The bread was old when it was served. The meals come out and my chicken lasagna was drowning in sauce so much that I couldn't see where the lasagna started. Once I started to eat it, it was lukewarm. When the server was taking our plates she asked how it was. We said it wasn't good, and all she did was giggle."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for 10+ years. It's not always the promptest of service but it's tasty, reasonably priced Italian food. My family loves the meatball pizza and eggplant Parmesan."}
{"text":"Portofino's is a great spot for lunch or dinner. It has a very large menu with a lot of options for anyone. If you are in the mood for Pizza or a nice sit down pasta meal this is a great spot for it. Great venue with very good staff. I highly recommend Portofino's!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. I am a big fan of their home made dressing. 

Descent Italian."}
{"text":"This place has its shortcomings, but I can't stay away. You can't go wrong with the pizza. Went last night and had a great waiter. Husband ordered the medium calzone with pepperoni and italian sausage and it was huge! The red sauce was excellent. They also make a very good dirty vodka martini. I ordered the white pizza and  it was so good. The mozzarella and ricotta, yum! I love their pizza crust. Not too thick, not too thin and just the right amount of chewy. Also, the cheese steak is killer as well."}
{"text":"Really nice food and great server. Be back again for sure. Portions are plentiful, pleasant surroundings"}
{"text":"Very good meal...gone before I thought to take a picture!!! 

I cant recall the name of the dish I had but it was sautéed shrimp with sundried tomatoes and mushroom in a creamy marinara or \"vodka\" sauce on a bed of linguini.  It was perfection.  

My hubby had the Florentina pizza which was a tad greasy, but still good.  It had chicken, ricotta, pesto and something else I cant remember.

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just no. My co workers said how good this is for Italian and I hardly eat it. It was very bland, no flavor and mushy. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Linguini and clam sauce equals WOW. Very nice comfortable atmosphere, great Italian choices, and amazing bread.
We stopped for an early dinner and the service was wonderful. It was my first time there. which surprised me because I live only. few miles away - but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best cheese calzone. It's usually very busy so I preorder takeout."}
{"text":"Everything about the meatball sub is great...fresh bread, tasty marinara, but TERRIBLE meatballs. I assumed they'd be authentic considering this is an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant. I've had other dishes and have been very satisfied-but this was the worst."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!!! 

According to yelp they close at 10:00 pm, but i just called at 9:05 pm, and a rude man said that they are closed. Either yelp needs to update this restaurant hours, or this is one super unprofessional establishment."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the second time and the service got worse not sure how it could...the waitress was awful, bread came out hot but was as hard as a brick, then she comes back about ten minutes after dropping the food off and says \"your done?\" As she is taking my plate from in front of me well actually I wasn't done but guess I was at that point. Won't be back"}
{"text":"At first I was hesitant to walkin as the front area is where the pizza is made for take out. The main sitting area is in the back. I'm glad I walked in.
The caprese salad was amazing, fresh tomatoes, mozzarella and sweet basil with a touch of olive oil - freshness in every bite. Pizza margerita a little on the chewy side, had some difficulty finishing it off."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like a very nice Italian eatery - I was in Charlotte area for business, and I didn't expect a lot from an Italian place in Charlotte to be honest. I would say the food was ok. Not bad, but ok. The reason for this is because some of the items we received seemed to be warmed up in the microwave - some of my coworkers and I came to this conclusion because the meatballs were very hot to the point where you couldn't bite into the meatball without burning your tongue. 
I ordered the veal parm with angel hair pasta. All Tasted good. The service was great considering we had a rather large group. 

5 stars for service 
5 stars for parking 
3 stars for taste and quality of food
5 stars for proximity to hotel
4 stars for price"}
{"text":"Love the pizza!!!  Never fails me, it's so delicious. Everything is homemade and fresh!!"}
{"text":"I was always a fan of Portofinos, but we went last night on Valentine's Day and it sadly was not up to par. My lasagna was cold and watery, my husband's shrimp in the shrimp scampi was tough as leather.... Our daughter left her  Gorgonzola  chicken with 3/4 of the plate left. It was not a busy night, only a 15 min wait, no reservations accepted, so I may need to reevaluate going to this place again. :(("}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place but over the last 12 months something is lacking the food is extremely bland... We have been back a few times ( on our cheat days, as we dont do a lot of heavy carbs anymore so it's a treat) but we keep getting disappointed. This saddens me as we always enjoyed this place back in the day..."}
{"text":"Their NY style pizza is consistently great.  We also love their homemade salad dressings, especially the house dressing."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout cuz it was just one of those days, and cooking was not high on my priority list. Called in my order from maybe a half mile away. Got turned around because I'm not too familiar with Ayersley. So if you go the place is on the right side. Anyway after about 10 minutes I got to the counter and my order was done. Now that was service. The employees weren't super friendly, but neither was I, so it was a push.
I ordered a small cheese pie and a meatball parmigiana. The pizza was very good. New York style. I enjoyed every bit of it. The meatball sub was good. Not great. There was something missing about it. I think I'm searching for childhood memories in every bite, which is huge to live up to. 
 Anyway, I will definitely go back to try the rest of the huge menu they have to offer."}
{"text":"I went here on a business trip and the team I was with wanted to bring us here for dinner.  We had a great time visiting, but while it sounds like they come here quite frequently I can only give it three stars.  It should have been a clue when the waitstaff was speaking to us in Spanish at an Italian restaurant.  We ordered some appetizers which were ok, but they were primarily fried.

The second sign that I should have been concerned was the massive number of items of the menu.  I believe that a smaller menu where everything is executed well is more important than being able to serve every dish possible from an Italian cookbook or grandmother.For dinner, I ordered a shrimp and pasta dish which was fine but did not stand out at all.  I think that they pride themselves on big portions and lose some focus on the quality of the food.  

I appreciate the thought from the team that brought us here, but I may be spoiled from having had lots of really good Italian food."}
{"text":"You get one opportunity to make a first impression and the one I got is one a company should strive to never let a customer have. Let's start with parking: it's terrible. You have to park in the parking garage and there's no covered walkway so try not to come if it's raining. 

The restaurant was warm inside. We overheard another table request to move due to it so it wasn't just us. The table next to us had an annoyed look on their face when we came in, along with empty plates. I can assume their experience was as... wonderful... as ours.

About 8 minutes later, a server finally came for a drink order. We offered our meal order too as we already had plenty of time to decide. He then turned to the annoyed couple, who promptly asked for their check. 

He returned with their check and bused another table. He collected their payment and brought their receipt along with our drinks (teas, not alcohol, so why he didn't bring them with the check for the table next to us is beyond me).

Bread was brought to the table, warm, so that was on point.

Then the meals came. What was ordered: 1- chicken parmesan and 1- chicken franchese. Respectfully, different dishes. At the time of ordering, we were not asked for our preference on pasta, which they give 5 options. 

I had the chicken franchese. As he placed my order in front of me, he confirmed \"chicken parmesan,\" which I said no, I had the franchese. The plate was still put in front of me and I had to say 3x \"this is not what I ordered\" before he looked at his notes to confirm.

He took the plate and retreated to the kitchen. He came back and said my meal would be out in a few seconds (hopefully they somehow weren't bringing me raw chicken). I asked for the manager in turn. 

The manager seemed nonchalant, like the fact that the other person ate their meal to avoid it getting cold and, by the time my order would arrive, they would be finished. I asked for it to be boxed.

He never mentioned comping the meal, the server did when he brought the check. 

When I got home and finally got to eat my meal, it was less than desirable, clearly an entree the chefs do not know how to properly prepare.

Like I said, terrible first impression. We won't be back."}
{"text":"House dressing was delicious. Pizza was really good and my friends that had the lasagna said it was good. Would go back."}
{"text":"I love being in walking distance to a great Italian place! The bruschetta is probably the best I've ever had, excellent fresh garlic and tomatoes. My boyfriend and I both love the pizza and it can feed us for two meals. We also love the patio area when the weather is nice. Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"This is a genuine small shop Italian restaurant. Don't expect the Olive Garden when you come here. To the uninitiated, the menu can be daunting because of the overwhelming options -- but rather, understand that you can get your meal in any way you want. You want some pasta? Pick your pasta type, pick your sauce, add some meat... They will make special orders with no questions asked. And pay attention to their specials. Some of the best meals I've had were their specials which usually come on massive plates and are always delicious. The price is reasonable, especially if you're eating pizza, but expect to pay a little more for meat dishes."}
{"text":"As I sat down, my waiter was Grant, I believe. We have a larger table. A party of 12. 

The food was nothing spectacular. The service I had was mediocre. No smile was given. And was looked over a few times and ignored. 
At first I looked at the reviews when I sat down I did not understand the rating but after experiencing the service and food. I understood. 

Overall I would not come again. Nothing about this place was memorable. Other than the cute date night atmosphere surrounding the restaurant I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"I'm sad with the experience I had here. Used to be one of my favorites. Came here for my birthday yesterday and left hungry. I ordered veal Marsala, the first dish was wrong(I was brought veal parmesan) sent it back, second time they brought me chicken Marsala, I sent that back. The third time they got it right but in an attempt to push the food out quick, the dish was bland, sauce was watery and the veal was tough as shoe leather. By this time I just wanted to leave, and when I got the bill they still charged for the so-called side salad that came with the meal. Really!?! Worst birthday dinner, EVER. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We ordered a small pizza to share. The wait staff was very helpful and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Took family out for special occasion dinner.  Staff has been great recently.  Food is superb.  We run the gamut when it comes to tastes and you can't go wrong with anything.  Get the specials when you can (but watch the price!!), they're not always available.  (lunch is $9-14, dinner $12-24)

Tried the veal shiitake.  Unfortunately it was swimming in butter (all I could taste) and the veal was tough.  Couldn't finish it. My wife's Gorgonzola salad was great, the swapped the meat for cheese and she loved it."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight. If you're looking for a semi romantic vibe, but also laid back and some great Italian food, this is the spot! Only complaint was the waiter took our bread away before we were finished..and if you've been here before, you know how good the bread is!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a take out slice of pepperoni and it was very good. Not overcooked and quite cheesy."}
{"text":"We eat here almost every month, excellent veal and pasta dishes, pizza and likes the seafood salad."}
{"text":"I think it's time for an update on my review on Portofino's.  I actually do return here and I've just learned to stay away from the daily specials.  Everything else is usually good here from the sandwiches to the regular lasana to the Chicken gorgonzola which is one of my favorites.  

They also make their own house salad dressing which is a tomato-based creamy italian.  It's great on salads and also it's good for dipping your bread into. 

The pizza is very good here as well, probably one of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte because they still make it in a regular pizza oven and not one of those conveyer belts."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good pasta dishes, but for some reason I'm just not crazy about it. If you like pasta though, I'd definitely suggest checking it out. While they have the signature italian dishes, such as manicotti, calzones, strombolis, etc., they also have a pretty good lunch pasta menu. This pasta menu allows you to choose your noodle, sauce type, & some other options, letting you truly get the type of pasta you want.

So while I really can't pinpoint why this place just doesn't do it for me, it might have something to do with the atmosphere. For the lunch crowd, I don't think it needs to be so dark inside, like I'm eating at a fine Italian restaurant for dinner. If they brightened up the place & made it a little less formal, I'd probably go here a little more often. But that's me, so make your judgment on your own. And like I said before, the food is really quite tasty so there isn't anything wrong in the most important department (taste)."}
{"text":"Portofino's is the gold standard for ordering pizza for an event at work. You know that the event is important when they step up the Papa John's game to the wonderful pizzas that Portofino's makes. 

I had been meaning to eat here for years but never quite made it out. I finally got around to it for a lunch recently and the experience was a little lackluster. The food was fine, but not as amazing. My personal pizza came out when my boyfriend was almost done with his sandwich and wasn't as good as I remember the full size pizzas. Then it took a while for us to flag down the waitress to get our check which can be stressful during the work week since I had a set time I needed to be back at my desk. 

They have always been a great catering options but I doubt I would return for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"We love Portofinos. The food is good and the portions are huge. I always have leftovers for at least another meal. Their pizza is my husband's favorite. It's our go to place for Italian."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place gets such mediocre reviews.  I was here with a friend today for lunch and the place was packed.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  

My friend had the Gorgonzola Chicken with a side of fettuccine and I had the Cheese Steak Special and with a order of fries.   I tried the chicken on my friends plate and it was to die for; the mushrooms, chicken, and cream sauce were very good.  The cheese steak was one of the better ones that I've had here in CLT.  We also really enjoyed the warm bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and parmesan cheese. 

The service we had was great.  Our tea was always full and our food came out quickly.  Not the cheapest lunch in the world, but I'm looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"So I decided to go to Portifinos (on Arsley) because I had been to the one on Park and really enjoyed it! The service was great- the food excellent! 

Unfortunately the three other times I have gone to this Portifinos I have had literally the opposite experience (although these times have all been for lunch and the time at Park was for dinner)

The first time was on my birthday (I know what a bummer) ...My co-workers and I split a large NY style pepperoni pizza and for dessert I took a piece of tiramisu back to work with me. The pizza was less than ok- very salty, super oily . The thinness was correct- but it just wasn't right (I should have known better being from NY but I figured my dinner was so good the time before)....The dessert was WAY worse, so disappointing! I had to throw it out because the cream had gone bad ....it was just awful.

The second time I went to this location was also for a work lunch...this time I went back to the original pasta dish I ordered the first time I went to dinner on Park. The pasta noodles were mush - and my co-workers had a similar bad experiences with their chicken (on pizza, and a sub) being overly dry. To make matters even worse our service was awful- and we sat waiting a very long time for our check ( a two hour lunch here is a bit much-it wasn't busy!) 

the third time was unfortunately not a charm...I had the chicken parm dish- which  was at best mediocre.

Go to the one on Park if you really want to try it...I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with lots of options. I loved my chef salad with house dressing. The wait times have been a bit long the past few times I've visited (20ish minutes for food) but other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Super, super good. The service was excellent - Scott was friendly, offered great selections, and was on top of it. As for the food - definitely solid. The salads were good, bread was terrific, and both of us enjoyed our main courses. I had chicken piccata (YUM) and my boyfriend has meat ravioli with Bolognese sauce. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good Italian! This is my go to spot for Italian food. Service can be a little slow but it's not bad, just don't expect to be in and out. The wine menu is great, I recommend!"}
{"text":"Portofino's is a rather cozy restaurant with pretty good Italian food. The service when I visited left something to be desired. Also, one in my group was told that the calzone had pepperoni and ham in it and when it came, there was only cheese."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Saturday Night. and they have good reviews. so the average local likes this place. Now when it comes to Italian food (or Mexican food) with me - I am not your average local. I was born, raised and FED Italian food my entire childhood. I come from a big Italian family, most everyone cooks, including me. so read my review with that in mind. It was ok food. I wouldn't say it was great. MAYBE I could say it was good, but then it might sound as though I am approving how they make the Italian dishes. And I do not. For starters, we ordered an antipasto dish that was suppose to include Mortadella - an expensive Italian ham. It did not. It had Food Lion brand ham. It also had processed turkey roll on the plate. You dont ever under any circumstance put turkey, never mind turkey roll, on an Italian antipasto plate. period. Then came my Shrimp Scampi entree. I wasn't impressed. I couldn't taste any garlic in it at all. I couldn't taste any butter. The lemon you could taste. And my fettuccine I am not so sure was fettuccine...you know those noodles you get in Cambells chicken soup? I got that.  So while the service was good, and the place packed, I have to tell you the food was ok at best.  If you are from a part of the US where Italians live in abundance and you have been eating good Italian food, you may want to skip this place. If you think Pizza hut is perfectly acceptable food, come on in, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some take home dessert. Chocolate cake was amazing as was the cheesecake!!!!

We always enjoy the pizza!! Authentic Italian pizza you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"pizza was really good, super thin and greasy...but I feel it was a bit overpriced..Out the door, 2 toppings was $16 + change for a medium....probably won't go back"}
{"text":"First Time here, I ordered the Chicken saltimbocca, it was the worst chicken I have ever tasted, it tasted as if it was made in the microwave and the sauce was put on top afterwards. The server never once asked us how our food was. I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant and to bring friends and family,  never coming back!!"}
{"text":"Repulsive takeout experience...ordered pasta entree and received over cooked noodles, watery and bland marinara sauce, and very dry tasteless meatballs. The fried calamari had an extremely fishy odor and were burnt and rubbery. Extra sauce was also forgotten in my order. Evident that low quality ingredients are used and recipes lacking flavor and not cooked properly. In addition, the meal was overpriced and I could not even eat it. Very dissatisfying and will not go back."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat in but have gotten food to go several times. Love the cheese ravolis and my husband loves the pizza cheese steak sub. They are always friendly when I pickup. Will return."}
{"text":"The wife and I dropped in for lunch the other day and things were so good I decided to write an update.  Veal Shitake was some of the best Italian food I have had in a while and the veal parmigiana was top notch as well but the reason I felt compelled to write an update was the dessert.  

Normally we are not tempted by desserts out but after the waiter ran through the usual suspects, tiramisu, cheese cake, cannoli, he mentioned Italian rum cake and my wife and I both perked up.  We decided to split a piece.  Let me say now that if I didn't love her greatly I might have slipped her a mickey and ate the whole thing myself.  This was the lightest, most flavorful, moistest, most balanced cake ever in the history of cake.  Mildly sweet with a hint of rum, light whipped cream and a light chocolate and vanilla pastry cream filling between layers. 

 Do yourself a favor, go to Portofino's just for an espresso and a slice of this heavenly confection."}
{"text":"Had to wait a bit for a clean table but the meal was great. Out server apologized for the wait and brought us fresh bread. All the food was very good and the mussels were fresh. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at Portofino's in years but used to frequent. They also have a location that I went to in Gastonia. I can say they are consistent - my favorite dish is Shrimp Fra Diavolo and it is the same as the first time I had it 20 years ago at the other location. Delicious! Great fresh tasting sauce, huge shrimp, just right clams. The crusty bread is just right and I could drink their house salad dressing. Bf got the chicken Marsala and the flavor was also on point. For a delicious, casual Italian meal (or a fantastic real pizza pie), I recommend Portofino's. 

P.S. When I say casual I mean decent casual, folks. We saw some rednecks walk in wearing sloppy t-shirts and short-shorts... . Come on ppl, have a little respect for yourselves. 

I wish the bar was bigger at Portofino's but I guess the size keeps them from having a 'bar crowd' and the trouble that goes along with it. They certainly have a steady stream of diners, a testament to their food and service."}
{"text":"-service was slow
-booth was dirty underneath 
-pizza was cold
-sub tasted like dog food
-manager never came to table 
-silverware was rolled with dirty linen 
-bathrooms weren't stocked 
-unpleasant dining experience 
-no assistants with umbrellas for outside seating
-no pre-bussing"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! We were originally going to Olive Garden but stopped here instead...AMAZING ITALIAN!  The pasta was super fresh.  The chicken breast is delicious and you can go wrong with adding Jumbo shrimp.  The bread came out warm from the oven and the house Italian salad dressing is one of a kind.  I didn't have room for dessert, but the Tiramisu is made in house and on my list to try next time along with their oven fresh pizza."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Potofinos for years- this is not a great location. It seems to be ok when dining in but anytime we get take out its not good at all. Pasta Primavera had NO FLAVOR at all. I've never had bad service here but the pasta is not worth the price tag. Pizza is awesome as are the appetizers."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there were a lot of problems. The bread was burnt (both servings), the waiter forgot to bring me a water, he gave my son an adult-sized soda even though I asked for a kids-sized soda, he charged me for an extra soda on the bill (check your bill!), and there were no paper towels in the bathroom. It was a freaking disaster, really. The three stars is for good food (other than the bread)."}
{"text":"Truly underwhelmed here.   We came for the meatballs, which we had read were fantastic.  They were by far the low point of the meal. Very soft. No crust on the outside and very very bland.  The marinara sauce was similarly bland.  No spice to it at all.   So the spaghetti and meatballs really a disappointment.  The chicken portion of the dish was very nice but it was once again paired with the bland marinara.  Service was fine but the ambiance suffered due to a very large (25 person) party that was just loud and there was other seating that they could have put us at.  I just feel that there has to be a better Italian restaurant experience out there."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Portofino's and it was a good one. I was there with a large group from work. The service was friendly, informative & quick. We started with some apps., mozzarella sticks, calamari & bruschetta. All were top notch. The bruschetta was a little heavy on the garlic but this is an Italian place. I ordered one of the specials for the evening, surf & turf, Fillet mignon and shrimp over a tomato based risotto. The risotto was fantastic, nice & creamy. One of my co workers had the chicken parm which he said was tremendous. Next time, I'll stick to their specialties, pasta and pizza. I ordered the tiramisu for dessert. Nice presentation and really a great way to end a meal. I'll be back for another go at this place."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and was craving some good Italian food. Parking was free in the Arysley garage and when we walked in, it looked like a mom and pops place. We came for an early dinner before the rush and was sat right away. The tables are tight so you can definitely hear the conversation next to our table. Maybe we had a newer server but it felt like she kept on coming up and rushing us (for drink orders, apps, entrees, etc) and interrupting our conversation. But it was ironic because we waited in between our apps and entrees for at least 25 minutes for dinner so by the time I received my pasta, I wasn't as hungry anymore. I love pasta with clams so I decided to try it here and it was ok. Not very flavorful and the clams were tiny; some shells didn't even have clams in them. They have a big menu so maybe we can come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Two poor experiences so I've had my fill with Portofinos. 
That said...the servers were pleasant if they're not closing down the place around you.
First time... Server wiped the table/menus down with a mildewed rag. Menus and table reeked for the rest of the meal. Asked to be re-sat, but apparently there was no space. Food was nice.
Second visit...no smell of decay, but the food was microwaved to a temp hotter than then sun. Also, I'm not a fan of canned chicken. Meal tasted like a school lunch I had in 1978. I think I paid $1.50 for that meal in '78 and that was about what this was worth. 
If you're a fan of the sub-par, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"You know what, I was pleasantly surprised by Portfino's. My Chicken Portbello was absolutely fantastic, the bruschetta appetizer was delicious as well. I found our server funny, and engaged. The overall experience was a good time and the lemonicello shot made it even Merrier."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Dishes prepared authentically.  Husband had gnocchi with tomato sauce and I had fettuccine alla panna.  Both were seasoned in a traditional style which may seem bland to some, but we enjoyed both.  Gnocchi is meant to be served with a simple tomato sauce to allow one to appreciate the texture and feel of the dumpling.  The staff was welcoming and friendly even on a busy New Year's Eve"}
{"text":"We live in the Steele Creek area, and this is the only place we get pizza from. Food is very flavorful and authentic. Pasta dishes are well made--sauces seem to made with fresh ingredients and seasonings  (unlike the junk at Olive Garden).

It's more of a casual place, very clean and family friendly.

Service is also good, if you eat in, though most of the time we take out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I have to say parking is absolutely frustrating especially at lunch. Which is why I deducted a star. The food was delicious! Our service was perfect and the price was perfect this even include two glasses of house Cabernet. It was super busy but we didn't feel neglected and I love that."}
{"text":"I had the al pesto penne pasta. What a beauty. All my colleagues who had their stuff were impressed too. Very good ambience as well. Worth your visit."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Italian cuisine and Portofino's is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to go for a quick fix. This particular Portofino's is alot smaller and is very well hidden from view (Pretty much everything in Ayresley Village is). I don't think I've tried anything here that I disliked. They have a great variety for every taste. I especially love their pink sauce on anything! The price is great for the flavor and portion size that you receive. We usually dine here on the weekdays and there's usually a good crowd of people stopping by for a business dinner. The only negetive would have to be their waitors/hostess's. Not always the most personable people, but their definately not rude :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out.  They speak broken English so that was fun but worth it since the food was great.  Authentic Italian."}
{"text":"Just overall a blah experience.  The service was decent but nothing special and the food was just not hitting the spot whatsoever.
I ordered the margharita pizza assuming I couldn't go wrong but I did...I went very very wrong.  The sauce on the pizza was water and almost flavorless, the crust was decent but the pizza itself was very doughy and soggy.  I couldn't taste any basil and the mozzarella wasn't fresh.  No fresh tomatoes, just a runny sauce.  Not very good at all.

Two others ordered the penne vodka (not on the menu) and added chicken.  The chicken looked like it was on the floor in the back of the restaurant, collecting dirt, getting stepped on and then heated up in a microwave to just ensure it was nice and shriveled.  Rubbery, tough, flavorless.  Gross.  The vodka sauce was again sub par.  Just not good!!

One of my other dining partners got the clam sauce and he said it was okay but nothing that great.  

Our starter salads were decent but again just not great.  The bread served prior the meals was okay.  

We weren't offered dessert but the desserts in the cooler looked old and stale.  

Overall, I would never make the trip to come to this particular location again.  Others mentioned how great it is at the Park Road location so I am willing to give that one a try."}
{"text":"Average restaurant. The Arribiata pizza I ordered was lacking flavor. The crust was good but the toppings... Meh. And it was not spicy at all. I actually thought it must be their regular sauce. 

I ordered a beer. Their beer selection is ATROCIOUS!  I got an 'exotic' Yuengling. You know that taste of a beer that has been chilled, got warm and chilled again?  Bingo!  I was with a customer so I didn't complain.  Never a good thing to do at a customer dinner. 

I really doubt I will ever go back. If I do, I will order a brick oven pie but it's limited in size - probably have a small oven."}
{"text":"I love the white pizza  I live close to this one and I always like to take out. We eat in once in a while but this is my go to pizza spot"}
{"text":"First of all name on review is spelled wrong...should be Porto.....    Ordered a Sicilian pizza and then 2 slices of regular to go.  The very courteous gentleman who made the pie let me sit and enjoy 2 Sicilian slices and one thin slice.  The thin traditional slice was better....but the sauce is very good and the extraordinary customer service pushes the rating from 3 to 4."}
{"text":"Great meal and great service. Huge portions and a nice little spot in Ayrsley for an Italian dinner.

We started with a plate of mussels in white sauce to start. Heavy on the garlic and butter, but a big plate and fun to eat. Maybe a special fork would have been useful because after about two of them, you just give up and go at it with fingers. At the end, you're left with a plate of butter and garlic that's perfect for the table bread.

The caesar salad was a big miss. A platter of romaine lettuce topped with croutons that did not seem handmade and then shredded mozzarella cheese? With a small pot of sharp caesar dressing on the side. Me, I prefer my salad dressing already tossed into the salad and with actual parmesan cheese. We took a couple bites and then left the rest.

The main course was great. My wife opted for the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tender and the mushrooms and sauce were flavorful and rich. The marinara sauce on the pasta was a little sweet and heavy with basil.

I chose the Chicken Gorgonzola. The sauce was very rich and very cheesy. Lots of mushrooms in there. Where my wife's chicken was tender, mine was a little rubbery and tough. Not enough to send back, but enough that it took some effort to cut with the steak knife. Since hers was perfect, I'm thinking that mine was just an off one.

For dessert, we got a tiramisu to share. Almost entirely lady fingers and mascarpone custard, there was no rum or coffee soaked into it. Sweet and tasty, but not quite tiramisu.

Overall, a good meal and great service from Tiffany. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This is my favorite take out spot for pizza and cheese steaks. I can't say much about the rest of the menu, but the pizza is the best New York style pizza in Charlotte. It's a shame that they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Meant to try for a while as I heard it was good and they are opening one in Indian Land. It was disappointing. My chicken Marsala was tasteless. My wife's Stromboli was not cooked. The dough was raw. The service was good and the portion sizes super. I will give pizza a try if they come to IL but wish we went to piedmont social house."}
{"text":"I ate at Portofino's today for the first time. I had the lasagna special that had crab meat, I believe, in it. It was delicious and filling. The waitress was extremely nice and attentive throughout our lunch. Then bread and house sauce were also a delicious appetizer. I will return again & recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Last night my girlfriend carried a visitor to Portofino's' after Christmas shopping. They arrived shortly after 9.  The restaurant seemed like a nice place to go, have a glass of wine, and entertain. Unfortunately about the time their meal arrived the staff cut the bright lights on, started stacking chairs and cleaning up all around them. They boxed their meals and finished them when they got home. There was no consideration or warning given. Apparently management just doesn't care about their guests dining experience. I would stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter and wife after my daughters school play. The server we had was nice and attentive. 

We ordered affettato for an appetizer which was good, but under seasoned (needed salt)

We ordered a standard pepperoni pizza and a wood-fired margherita pizza. (Note about the wood-fired, the menu states that they are only available in 12-inch pies, but server asked for the size desired). The wood fired was really good and crispy. The pepperoni wasn't under cooked, but ok. 

The biggest issue was that we were still eating at 9pm and they were closing the restaurant around us. Literally, putting chairs up on tables around us. First, what restaurant closes at 9 pm on Thursday. Second, shouldn't you wait until your customers have left before you shut down."}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was the service. Our server was attentive and courteous. He did bring a Peroni instead of a Corona - honest mistake. Probably misheard. The menu is way too big and need to be cut down. My boyfriend ordered the special which was nowhere near worth the $25 it cost. I ordered the arabiatte sauce which had no heat. Both meals were bland. The warm bread and salads with house dressing were better than the meals. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We like going here as a family. Great food, nice atmosphere. I've eaten here 6 or 8 times, always enjoyable. The pizza is very good. The specials are always good. Decent wine selection. If you are looking for a good italian place in the Ayrsley area, you can't beat Portofino's. Good bread, great bruschetta."}
{"text":"Stopped by here the other day, trying to kill time before dropping someone off at the airport.  I have a real soft spot for Italian, so I am always endeavoring to find a really decent spot that will supply my stomach with Italian goodness.

Started off a little rocky since I am unfamiliar with this shopping center.  I think I was in awe of the mixed residential and businesses below apartment setup they have here and I totally drove by the parking lot.... we ended up parking \"in the back lot\" in between the Fintastic and Portofinos and the spaces were a little tight.  

We were greeted warmly and it was early Sunday afternoon... so we got seated right away.  Our server was pretty friendly... we felt a little rushed, even though we were one of the only tables being served at that time.  Still, our server got our orders correct and kept our waters/teas filled.

I ordered Portobello mushroom ravioli with Alfredo sauce... yes... I know, not the healthiest choices, but it was just what my stomach and tastebuds wanted that afternoon.  Next time I come here, I will definitely order pizza.  It looked very good from the distance."}
{"text":"Food is good. My husband loves it and I like it. Didn't get five stars because i prefer more sauce than I've gotten on a few dishes but flavor is good"}
{"text":"Easily the worst Italian food I've ever had. We ordered the mozzarella caprese for an appetizer and it wasn't good. It lacked a lot of flavor and had way too much oil. Everything was just soggy. I ordered the alla panna, which is supposed to be pasta with a really good cheesy cream sauce. It had zero flavor and it was really watery. The sauce was dripping off of the pasta like a water faucet. My wife ordered one of the pastas and it was watery, as well. I'm slightly upset that I paid 13.95 per meal because I know I could've made a better meal at home. We will definitely not be returning or recommending Portofino's to anyone."}
{"text":"Blah! Would be a good way to describe my food here. My daughter has been harassing me all week that she wanted a good philly cheese steak sub so a friend recommended this place for good subs! I ordered a cordon chicken plate which i wasn't crazy about at all which is where the blah comes in at barely had any taste i ended up sprinkling salt on it,but i just decided to send it back my daughter on the other hand loved her philly cheese steak it was more than enough for her so i ended up just eating her other half because she was stuffed i had the extasy martini which was ok i have had better was a little bitter tasting versus more sweet. We took the tiramisu to go home for dessert that was delicious. Our waiter Enrique was wonderful and i would try this place out again just because of him."}
