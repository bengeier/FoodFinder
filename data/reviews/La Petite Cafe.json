{"text":"This was my first & last time to this cafe. I went this morning. They had a specials of the day sign. I told the cashier, I'll take the bacon & eggs special, but don't need the toast because I don't eat gluten. She said, I don't know what u r reading, it doesn't come w toast...rude! I looked at the board & said the $3.99 special. She said oh. I wait for my take out order...& out comes this pathetic tiny scrambled egg & 1 slice of bacon. With my ice tea, that she forgot & I had to remind her (they were not busy), I paid $6.25...what a rip off! I said that's really sad for 3.99, she said well u should've read the sign, 1 egg/1 bacon. Um, I did read the sign, that didn't change the fact that it was pathetic food. She then said u could've got the 4.29 menu item that came w 2 eggs, potatoes, etc. I said, that would've been nice to know & good customer service to advise me since I had told her I never been there before & especially since I didn't take the toast, u think she may have offered something different. Why in the world would u offer a \"special\" that's a worse deal than a menu item?! That's a tricky way to rip people off. I have been to countless restaurants & even fast food places offer suggestions & want their customers to get the best deal so they r happy & come back. Anyways, I may not have been this upset, but she was so rude!!!!! I will post the pic of that terrible food!"}
{"text":"i was forced to eat here on multiple occasions because of work.    The waiting times are horrendous, even if you  order your food for takeout..  The staff seems overworked, they need more servers/staff...because this place gets BUSY and crowded for lunch.  The best thing to order if you are starving and stranded in this medical office building:  The Sun Healthy sandwich.  The sandwiches are not half bad."}
{"text":"Sweet potato pancakes, had to give them a try! They tasted very much like pumpkin pancakes, probably because of the spices. Still, they were good & really moist! The size is also nice, very normal, anyone could easily eat 3. In other places it seems like the pancakes are competing with the size of a human head, lol!   The coffee was really mild. I never thought I'd say this, but it needs to be a little stronger.   Call ahead with your order if you can. This place is a bit of a hang out & during 'peak' breakfast and lunch hours it gets busy."}
{"text":"Food is a little bland , not much variety , go there for the coffee if your forced to kill some time."}
