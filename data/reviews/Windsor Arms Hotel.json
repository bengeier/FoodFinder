{"text":"I really wanted to love high tea here. It's a beautiful hotel. The sandwiches were awful (extra tiny and bland) and the tea was cold. For the desserts we only got one of each so we had to discuss who was getting what or try and cut the already tiny desserts into smaller pieces for all to get a taste (everywhere else gives everyone the same dessert so there's no arguing). Not happy I spent $50 of my hard earned money on blah. Definitely won't go back for high tea."}
{"text":"This is a review for their Sunday brunch.   In a nutshell - pricey but luxurious.   I've heard about their fabulous Sunday brunch for awhile now so I was excited to finally come here with my sisters.  The spread is vast from their buffet tables to their made to order items.  Just to list off a few items at the buffet table: large steamed crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, vegetarian lasagna, number of salads, cheese, breads, pastries, petit fours, mash potatoes, etc.  As for their made to order items, you can order omelettes, pancakes and french toast.  I had their french toast and it was absolutely delicious.    Service was attentive.    At $50/person it's steep but worth it to try once.  Make sure you're hungry when you get there!"}
{"text":"this hotel is a beautiful quaint little property.  we came in for twilight tea and was blown away by the detail of their tea rooms. the sandwiches were hardy and the individual unique mismatched teapots were super cute. service was attentive and friendly.  90% of everything served was made in house from the jams for the scones to the individual sandwiches and petit fours. I was really impressed!"}
{"text":"I've tried high tea across the city and this is by far the best!  The ambiance is perfect, the service is good (not too stuffy).  Our entire experience was lovely.  More importantly, the warm scones and Devon cream were excellent (better than Four Seasons and Royal York) & the selection of teas were wonderful.   I took my mom here as we heard it was the best place in Toronto and it certainly deserves its reputation. I suspect that we had a better than average experience because it wasn't too busy in the tea room, only half the tables were occupied) so it made for prompt service and ample room to manoeuver.  A perfect way to spend a rainy summer afternoon in the city!"}
{"text":"Apparently the Windsor Arms was THE spot for high end hangouts in the 80s and then it shut down for at least a decade. Now, reopened, it's managed to regain some of its former luster, a lot though, is based on nostalgia. Hi tea is totally a white people thing, and as a whitey, I love it. Hi tea and guitar solos are two things that white people can't resist, and The Windsor Arms has a great service. It's not quite as modern as the Four Seasons, but it's not super traditional or group oriented like the King Eddy either. It's very quaint and cozy. Perfect for a cold afternoon."}
{"text":"Attended a wedding and reception this summer which took place in the hotel's dining room. The location and ceremony was beautiful, but the experience was tarnished by the horrific manners of the man in charge of the reception, who I later found out is actually the owner of the hotel. I was seated near the entrance to the kitchen, and in-between speeches could hear him yelling and swearing at the staff. Ours was the only table that seemed to hear, and one person considered going into the kitchen and speaking with him when the servers came out with the main course at which point the yelling stopped. The servers looked miserable throughout the night, which after the abuse I overheard doesn't surprise me. Throughout the night the owner would circulate the room looking grouchy, and was extremely rude in dealing with guests or the wedding planner. This is not the type of person who should be running a wedding reception or working with people at all. Had to leave my little rant here...for anyone considering holding a wedding here I would advise requesting that someone else run it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our 6 month anniversary a few weeks ago, and it was so awesomesauce it's my new favourite tea place. We came in 30 minutes late for the 12:30 sitting (trying to find parking in that area on boxing day is next to impossible!) but we still had plenty of time to gobble down our snacks.   We ordered the full tea, and were presented with a tea tray laden with scones, dense rolled up sandwich maki, and dainty desserts. I loved the scones, the boy loved the sandwiches, neither of us could finish the desserts, especially when they gave us complimentary strawberries and cream! They use Greaves jams, and clotted cream of course (some awful places stick you with whipped butter... like the Old Mill Inn). I had the earl grey rose tea, which was spectacular, as I love both flavours. Yum. Wonderful friendly service. I can't wait to go back.  The only things that marred this perfect experience was my boyfriend's stinky russian caravan tea which smelled of cigar smoke and the burning refuse left behind from a traveling russian caravan where I assume it got its name from. He loved it however."}
{"text":"Such a cool ambiance at the lounge/bar. Felt like I was back in London! Great drinks and excellent food, especially the dessert options!"}
{"text":"What can I say sitting in the Courtyard enjoying live piano play while eating my Sunday Brunch. The atmosphere is wonderful.  The pianist sits on the 2nd floor and the music traveling throughout the courtyard.  The spacing of the tables is plenty. The waiter is polite. The food display is neat and tidy.   The first table to catch my eyes is the dessert table. There are dipped strawberry, strawberry, creme brûlée , chocolate cake, mousse, cup cakes and lots more. I try them at the end of the meal.  The crème brûlée is disappointed.  It is very thick and solidified.  For the entree, there is large, I mean real large, King Crab which has lots of meat. King Crab lover will sure love it.  Shrimp is big, tender but doesn't have the shrimp taste. The smoked salmon is one of a kind. Don't miss the Caesar salad. Only the sprout part of the lettuce is chosen and mixed with tiny dice of celery gives you a crunchy feeling. Another salad is also tasty. The a la King with mushroom is juicy. The lamb shank is average.  The bean and asparagus are very fresh. The disadvantage of having them warming in closed trays makes them turn yellowish at the end of the meal.  The roast lamb is a bit dry but the roast beef is good.  I have a slice medium rare which is tender and juicy.  Given that the Courtyard may only have a seating of up to 100 people, there may not be too many choices for a buffet.  But the raw material quality selection is above average.   We order egg Benedict.  There is one that you can choose with salmon.  The egg is boiled just right.  The yolk flows out when you cut it.  I like the one with salmon.  You can also order omelettes.  Unlimited supply of orange juice, tea, coffee is also included.  We like it so much till the end.  We are reminded to leave after sitting there for 1.5 hours.  We do not know that there is a time limit nor we are reminded at booking. The waiter comes twice or 3 times within 15 minutes to politely ask us to leave before 1 pm as there is another seating. I don't think it is too comfortable to hear that especially you are having an expensive Sunday Brunch at $50 pp in such a high class hotel.  This definitely needs to be improved.  At least if we are informed at booking, there won't be such a pushy feeling.  Overall with the atmosphere, food and service, I am still willing to give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"great venue to have high tea for a stagette party!"}
{"text":"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE ***SUNDAY BRUNCH***  After reading countless disappointing reviews about this brunch, and against my better judgement my boyfriend and I brought his mother to the Windsor Arms brunch on a Sunday. With a steep price tag per person you expect primo service and food. Service was good - my coffee, water and orange juice never went dry, though the buffet food is just that - standard buffet quality fare - lukewarm, picked over, and lacking in flavour.  The upside was that you are able to order your eggs any style and eggs florentine, benedict or with smoked salmon directly from your server. These options were delicious.  I noticed that you are able to get an omelette made to order at one of the buffet stations but we never got that far.  Avoid the seafood at all costs - disgusting. Looks, and tastes like its been sitting out all day long.  The vegetables and salads were decent.   The soups were literally, lukewarm. I couldn't bear a shower in liquid that cold.  The desserts were all for show, nothing tasted very good - the best of the worst was a creme brulee cup -  relatively the worst I've ever had.   The french toast was very tasty, but again - lukewarm!   I don't understand why or how everything was so cold - I've had on set catered food out in the woods that was 1000% better than this brunch.   Save your money. Don't do it."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in our experience at the WIndsor Arms.  When paying over $500/night I expect near perfection. FIrst, the lobby is incredibly tiny, because I imagine, they used half of the original lobby when building the Residences attached.  The room (402) was handsome enough, but all the electrical outlets in the living area were unusable (not working) making it impossible to plug in our computer at the desk.  We ultimately had to sit on the floor in the bedroom area where we found the only working outlet (I'm too old for that nonsense!).  I had to tell the front desk TWICE before anyone attended to it.  And they really couldn't care less.  Housekeeping in this EXPENSIVE hotel was ATROCIOUS.  The coffee maker wasn't cleaned, the dirty glasses weren't collected in the mornings, adequate number of clean glasses were not replaced, even after notifying the \"butler\" and having a separate conversation about it with the maid herself!     Upon checkout we asked for a late checkout, which was given to us, but the front desk told me the room was to be occupied later that afternoon by another guest, even though the outlets were never repaired.  When I said something to her about this she said \"oh, thank you for the reminder\", rather insincerely.  This place seems like they are either run by teenagers or don't care because they'll be closing soon. Won't waste my money there again.  OH, one more thing....the toilets are very loud, like industrial airport toilets.  I could hear the neighbors flushing.  Never seen that in a  nice hotel."}
{"text":"January 21st was a day I was looking forward to for months. I had no idea where my friends were taking me for my bachelorette, but they planned a fun filled day. It started at the spa at Windsor arms, followed by high tea, then later a night on the town. I've never on my life have been to an establishment where I and my friends were treated like second class citizens and so rudely. They first did not have our reservation for high tea even aftery friend called the day before to confirm. They rushed and sat us upstairs outside the gym spa, a group of 6 girls at a table that can barely accommodate 4 people. There was literally no room for you to even set a plate down so you were left to eat your snacks from your lap. When we complained it took them forever to fix the issues and in that time(30mins lager) our food and tea were cold. Not only was it cold, simple things like sugar,milk, cream or even spoons were not even on hand. Finally a half hour later it certainly but we just carried on and tried to make the best because we were on a tight schedule for the day and well no one wanted to make a day which was suppose to be special to be ruined by incompetence from the management and staff. The manager of the spa had promised we would receive 50% off for services and tea. When it came time to pay Daphne the spa manager left for the day and did not reiterate anything to her staff. So we asked to speak to the manager, who took his time to come up and at one point wanted us to wander around the hotel to find him. George Friedman came in, looked at us and basically made up in his mind that we were a bunch of kids trying to screw him over and be cheap and not pay. He never introduced himself, or shook our hands. He never made eye contact with us. He kept saying people like you. You mean people who are young and have brown skin? At one point he approached my friend in the most confrontational, aggressive manner like he was going to hit her. How in any way is this professional or exude any ounce of customer service? I began to video tape the altercation. He kept saying why did you people come here? We don't want you here! I'm sorry if we look like highschool students, which we do because my friends and I are short and well are aging well. We are in our mid-30s, it is absurd to be treated like this and equally absurd that establishments like this one still exists. What's even more sad is that he actually owns the hotel. Eventually George honored the arrangement made by Daphne but that was only after we called her, which George refused to do. I think he wanted us to basically leave. Never in my whole life have I felt like a second class citizen and just well abused by the management of that hotel and spa. They are unprofessional have no regard to basically customer service and well have no idea how to manage.  I will never set foot in that place again, and well if anyone is reading this review you would be better to go to other high tea establishments that have better food and service. The Windsor Arms is not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"As a gift for a friend's birthday, instead of the usual drunken shenanigans, I arranged a gathering at the Windsor Arms for high tea. It was really fun to see how well everyone managed to clean up and look the part to tea with the blue-bloods, as it were. The selection of tea is exceptional (as you would expect) and the finger food delicious.   I've had cream scones with fresh jam in the Cotswold's (think Jane Austen), and the Windsor Arms seemed just as authentic to me."}
{"text":"This is a review of thier Sunday brunch.  The room was beautiful, I enjoyed the natural lighting, but I think that it was a bit too dark in the room for brunch. I think that they should have made it more bright in the room.   The brunch table was fairly limited and pretty basic. They mainly served up lunch items as opposed to breakfast dishes. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting there to be more of a variety. There were made to order items, but I didn't try them -- maybe I was missing out....  The tea was excellent. It was strong tea, so I recommend asking for less tea leaves if you prefer weak tea. However, I love my tea strong and this was very delicious. The dessert table was nice. I HIGHLY recommend the desserts. They were all very good and beat the rest of the food there...... However, it was first come first serve, so once they were gone, they were gone.   Overall, the ambiance was very nice; quaint. There was a woman who played the piano beautifully throughout the brunch service. The seafood there was fresh and delicious, but limited in its selection. The french toast and pancakes were cold and disappointing. I have been to better brunches in the past and would not return to this one as I felt it lacked variety. The food selection reminded me of a wedding cocktail hour for some reason.   The hotel is beautiful, but there are better brunch options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Used my groupon here and the waiter wasn't very good. I He was monotone during the whole service, never checked back on us after the food had arrived. Hostess staff didn't seem to want to be there either. Although my steak was cooked correctly, the chef had failed to season it, very bland and its never the same when you put salt on after the cooking process. I would understand if the place was busy, but they literally had 6 tables in this place? Would never return. I should've went to the keg, spent less money, had better service, and had a steak that was cooked with seasoning. I was in the hospitality business for over 10 years and this is not how you treat guests."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect.  From the minute we walked in, they looked after us with utmost care and respect.  Food prices were reasonable and it tasted great.  The only downside is parking in the area, or lack of."}
{"text":"Do not do Business with these people  ...Bad management.  I did work for them and they never paid me  !!   I am a small contractor and they never paid me my money that i work'd for  But the owner have no problem running after young girls and buying them new expensive shoes. I guess he feels good about shafting me !"}
{"text":"I went for lunch to the Living Room restaurant for summercilious we where a group of 10. The menu looked fine however the food was in need of some love, it was obvious that there was no care in the preparation.  The gazpacho was lacking in any type of flavour, it was dark in colour since the tomatoes came out a can, there was little pieces of watermelon floating around that seemed to be in the soup for days. The calamari was overcooked and rubbery, plus it was over breaded. The spaghetti with clams was tasteless, just oil (where was the garlic?) with 4 clams the pasta portion was about 6 mouthfuls. The chicken dish tasted like it was taken out of the microwave, it was so bad the people that ordered it did not eat it.  While the service started out good it quickly went down hill when we advised him that the chicken was inedible.  The Windsor Arms always was a good address for food however its no longer the 70's where they best food in the city was at hotels, that era is gone they should catch up with the times if they want to market their restaurants to locals."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is based solely on the CHRISTMAS DINNER BUFFET 2013  Every year for the holiday season several downtown hotels offer a special holiday menu for those who opt to forego cooking at home for a refined evening out where the focus can be on enjoying a good meal in the company of family and/or friends. Having heard good things about the Windsor Arms Hotel I was quick to make my reservation for this years Christmas Dinner buffet. My parents, my partner and I were happy with the Hotel itself: the interior of the hotel is beautiful and the holiday decor very festive. We were seated in an intimate side room just off the main dining room where the buffet was situated.  The waitstaff were very friendly and greeted and seated us to our table however it was difficult to find our waitress after that for wine, water, etc. We were told they were short staffed. The buffet itself was standard size but not impressive. Because it was Christmas my family and I were most looking forward to turkey, stuffing, vegetables and nice desserts however it was very disappointing. In fact we heard comments from other guests confirming how we felt. The turkey appeared like pressed turkey and was sitting in a serving tray filled with watery \"gravy\" which we had to sift through to find a suitable piece. The stuffing was very disappointing(mostly large bread pieces with minimal seasoning), and there were overcooked brussel sprouts and very bloody prime roast. Desserts were disappointing(bread pudding, mini tiramisu, moose cake and mini meringues).   We left feeling disappointed. I personally had expected much higher quality from the Windsor Arms but after this experience I would not return for another holiday meal nor would I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I came here once for high tea and was really disappointed. The high tea for someone with food intolerances was no where close to as good as the one for people without food intolerances. I received very little food was still hungry after. My gluten and dairy free high tea was not worth the $75 I paid after tax and tip (I did get a glass of prosecco). I would give the high tea experience one star.   On a high note, I attended a private event at the Windsor and the atmosphere was really great. The ambiance was really nice and all of the guests seemed to have had a good time. One friend and I asked to see the main dining hall as we arrived late and the server followed us the entire time. This experience made me feel slightly uncomfortable. Allover, I would give renting out the Windsor and hosting a private function a three star rating."}
{"text":"I went for brunch on Sunday w/ my friend w/ a daily deal voucher. I've been there before for Winterlicious and once again the food & service was exceptional! The staff are sooooo nice!"}
{"text":"My workplace had a gorgeous company dinner.  We had 125 guests and dined in the main dining room.   What a fantastic experience, the service was impeccable and the food was delicious.   We had a prixe fixed menu and I had the Beef Short Rib.   Everything was great,  I love the service and the decor makes you feel like you are dining with Great Gatsby!  Honestly if your company can afford to have a large event at this hotel then I would suggest you do it!   It was a lovely night and everyone really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Glittering chandeliers, posh building, and obsequious service - the stage is set for high tea.  The tea itself was delicious, and the sugared biscuits lived up to their fame.  On the con side, the rooms are crowded, and I remember worrying about people brushing things off our table!  Some of the tea sandwiches were a bit ambitious for me, but if you like caviar, then go ahead.  It was very pretty (the china and silver were beautiful) but too hectic for my tastes."}
{"text":"Very chic establishment in Toronto. Staff is very attentive and the whole atmosphere makes you feel special. Been there many times for dinner and enjoyed my food every time."}
{"text":"Although I have not stayed in the hotel, I did enjoy their High Tea and it was quite an interesting adventure.   Served in the traditional British manner, high tea at The Windsor Arms is a sophisticated and elegant way to enjoy an early evening dinner. You select your tea (I had the rose Earl Grey which was so fragrant and quenching). Then you can order the food to accompany it; scones and finger sandwiches created with love and an obvious attention to detail.   The tea is served in a very regal looking dining room with big, comfy chairs, lots of doilies on the table and an air of utter pretension!  The food was delicious - I couldn't eat the sandwiches and scones fast enough.  Also, I was surprisingly full after our meal. And for just $24 a person, it's comparable for what you would spend on an average meal anyway. Plus, you get to enjoy that added sense of dignity when you walk out into Yorkville, knowing you've just eaten where the Spice Girls and Britney Spears once dined as well!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Windsor Arms for two nights.  I was disappointed overall.  I expected a very high level of service and amenities.  While the staff was very friendly and attentive, there were just a number of issues that detracted from my enjoyment.  First, you're paying a pretty high price so things should be excellent.  The good:  clean, large room and staff who seem to care.  The bad:  Bed was OK but far less comfortable than the bed I had at a Marriott in NYC recently.  It should be far more comfortable.  Toilet paper belongs in a cottage with a fussy septic system.  Like newspaper!  Breakfast service was very spotty and food (I had lunch one day) was barely adequate.  Once upon a time this place was a \"go-to\" foodie location - what happened?  Newspapers (3 of them!) were much appreciated but not delivered until well after 8:30 am - I would imagine the business guests are long gone before their newspapers are delivered.  The bar is dreadful.  Terrible decor, empty (one other customer) and just depressing.  I have always wanted to stay here - once, in the early '70's, I literally ran into Katherine Hepburn as she exited this hotel.  I really thought I'd love it but it seems like it is under occupied and trying too hard without really succeeding."}
{"text":"Very luxurious and well... you pay for it! One of Toronto's best.  My friend and I set up a girl afternoon tea date here on a gorgeous summer afternoon. We sat on their new patio, a cute little space enclosed within walls of ivy. The atmosphere was quaint and quiet- perfect place to catch up with a girlfriend or somewhere to bring your mom. Our server was fancy as ever, dressed in a tuxedo and even donning white gloves. I felt like a near royal with a personal butler service. Fabulous.  We had the traditional afternoon tea which included your choice of tea, sandwiches, fresh scones and petit fours. You can find the full description here: http://www.windsorarmshotel.com/tearoom/tradional_afternoon_tea Everything was delicious and fresh. We were definitely full by the end. I loved the whole thing!   The indoor room was elegant and traditional, I hope one day to come back and enjoy their tea room. The hotel has a luxury boutique feel and the prices definitely reflect that.   I recommend coming on a weekday for $35 per person as weekend prices jump to $42 per person. Definitely make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was the point in making a reservation for 3pm when we weren't seated until 3:45. We didn't receive food or tea till 4:30 when our reservation was for 3-5 pm. Also, we were a party of 6 (only 4 of us were allowed to use groupons), and I was told twice upon calling that the other 2 of us would have to pay $38 each for Jan 2nd, as per weekday pricing. However, when we went to pay, we were charged a whopping $170 for 2 people! The manager told me we were being charged holiday pricing which makes no sense as the website says holiday pricing ends Jan 1st, and since Jan 2nd is a weekday and it was day time tea, the price is clearly listed as $38 dollars on their website. He claimed that Jan 2nd is considered a holiday, but the website CLEARLY states holiday pricing ends Jan 1st. He refused to honour the pricing his employee had told me and told me maybe I had heard what I wanted to hear. Upon speaking to a higher level management the next day, I was told that we were charged \"standard holiday pricing,\" at $50 each instead of December holiday pricing of $65 (This \"standard\" holiday pricing is not listed anywhere on the website), plus tax and 18% tip for the groupons and then another 18% tip for our total which is absolutely ridiculous considering the poor service and overall experience. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our table wasn't ready and we had to wait ten minutes at the bar.  The table we got wasn't great , right next to a fire exit door, there was draft.  The bread and butter sever was spicy and was more like a dessert bread.  We ordered from the winterlicous menu, lobster bisque,  rack of lamb, marinated beef rib, creme brûlée and lemon trio.  The bisque was probably the best dish. The rest was really not worth the three digit final bill. I mean, come'on - you can eat at Canoe for the same money and the quality in incomparable!"}
{"text":"Went for high tea for mother's day. Scones were to die for and so were the chocolates. Not a big fan of the rolled up sandwiches (squishing the bread makes it so dense). But the tea room atmosphere made up for it."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday brunch offered at the Courtyard Cafe.  Ambience: beautiful ambience, and the pianist really does add to the atmosphere of the buffet along with the high ceilings.  For a hotel and price though at $50 I thought they'd have more attention to cleanliness.  I found our table okay but one of the settings was missing forks, and one of the napkins wasn't folded properly like someone had used it and tried to fold it up again, and the little bowl of maple syrup was used already and they didn't clean the bowl up or replace it with a new one.  Also, one of the coffee cups was looking a bit dirty.  Just some things you wouldn't expect at a nice high-end hotel.  Service: fantastic and very attentive.  Food: king crab and the prawns were delicious.  I didn't eat much of the hot food as it looked okay and the french toast was burnt or a bit overcooked.  I also felt like there could have been more choice.  The dessert was really decadent and delicious, so they get points for that!  I thought it was good that I got a Wag Jag deal on it, otherwise I wouldn't have really tried it or considered it a brunch option.  If you're looking for a nice Sunday brunch buffet, I'd personally recommend the Boiler House in Distillery.  More options at half the price (but obviously no king crab legs either!)."}
{"text":"I stay at the Windsor Arms about once per month. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. My room is always clean and ready for me when I arrive.   I really like that the Windsor Arms offers a vegan menu with a variety of small and large plates along with desserts. My favorite items to order are the kale salad and mushroom risotto. I think anyone, vegan or not, would enjoy these dishes!  Windsor Arms offers a complimentary breakfast in the restaurant. The breakfast is always relaxing and they have a great variety of items. My favorite is the tofu scramble!   The location of the hotel is great for shopping, museums, and dinning. It's not down by the CN Tower, but it's just a quick ride away by cab.   Windsor Arms is an exceptional hotel and I recommend it to everyone I know who travels to Toronto."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been here several times for high tea and it's great. But it's not *that* great. None of the food is something I'd ever crave, though the strawberries and cream at the end make a nice finishing touch (how could you go wrong). Just a heads up, the scones are lemony, not plain.  Lovely atmosphere with a different feel in every room.. yet somehow I've always been seated in the same room!"}
{"text":"I came here for high tea with my mom (courtesy of a wagjag deal). We arrived late by accident - believing our reservation was 30 mins later than it actually was. Thankfully they had exactly one table left that we were able to take. I had called ahead requesting a gluten free menu for myself, which was ready and waiting when we arrived. They had no issues with presenting me with much of the same items my mom was getting, just gluten free versions. The scones (!!) were soooo soft, warm and delicious. They gave me 2 and I ate them both. There was no resistance there.  The sandwiches were on gfree bread so obv they were a bit dry. No one has yet perfected the gfree loaf of bread so I don't blame them. They worked with what they had. The dessert was the only place where I could complain. Other high teas I have been to have a plethora of desserts on the tier tray and this just had one each, neither of which were very good. Regardless, the tea was fantastic - as many varieties as you could think of, all presented in lovely China pots to pour into your tea cup. The seats were comfortable and the ambience of the room in general was great. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Oh yes, the Windsor is Fancy Pants!   Walking in you think you'd stepped into some private upscale residence, or country club but it's this intimate old school moneyed type place of accommodation, and noooo I didn't come here for afternoon delight with hubby...I actually came here for a wedding.  I'd heard great things about the vegan menu offered from Prime (which is located within the Windsor)  so I was intrigued and wondered how well the vegan meals would be pulled off.  Being that this was a Korean/Wasp wedding, I had the dubious distinction of being the ONLY person that was going vegan with their entree of choice.  The entree was Stir-fried Tempeh and Vegetables in a teriyaki glaze with steamed quinoa and green baby seedlings.  I've had better versions of tempeh elsewhere, but still I am still glad I was able to have a beefless/porkless meal served up with finesse at a wedding without it becoming some big culinary kerfuffle.  The wedding service itself was tastefully beautiful and took place within the Courtyard Cafe. The seating we had was super plush and comfy.  After the vows were exchanged all 200 or so, of us guests were herded into the narrow space of Prime to wait out the seating re-arrangement and dining change-over.    The waiters were very quick and accomodating and I have to commend their utmost patience considering one of my more curmudgeonly uncle's petulence and persistence of bossing them around to no end!  The best part imo was the macaron and croquembouche trees, I would have taken a picture, but they were ravished within seconds!  Good to know: The restrooms are upstairs, so take the elevator to the 2nd floor cross the \"Bridge\" overlooking the hall, near the baby grand piano and you'll be lead to these super swish bathrooms complete with large handsome wood-doored, completely private cubicles, no need for mercy flushes here!  I can't comment with regard to what the pricing for hosting a wedding or event would be here, only can assume it would be on the expensive side of well, expensive...just be happy the event is open bar and drink-up!!!  In a nutshell I'll say the Windsor Arms is grande, elegant style on a small scale."}
{"text":"Worst Valentine's day ever! Thanks to this stupid hotel, its old creepy owner and its staff. I just don't have the words to describe how bad our experience was here. I really have no idea how this place is still in business. The place is old and dark, it definitely could use some renovations,  painting, flooring,  cleaning and most important, some customer service! I just don't know how people can pay so much for a place that's not worth it; where their all inclusive became a \"sorry that's not included\" where you are paying for the room and when you ask for your change they make you sign a receipt for your own change! How stupid can that be?  And beware if you want to call and ask for water because they will deny it to you! I mean what hotel in the whole world does that? Specially here in Canada,  where water is free!  And to top the whole experience, their \"luxurious pool\" faded our swimming suits paint away and they're ruined. Do you think they would pay for them? ... So guys, spread the word!  If you have the money to spend in a luxury hotel, go to a real one! Save yourselves and whomever comes with you such a disgusting time coming to this crappy hotel!"}
{"text":"I really love the Windsor arms. I love the tea room. They have a great brunch. It is on the pricey side. The ambience is my favourite part. It's such a beautiful spot. One thing that isn't so great is the service and staff. I have been frustrated more than a few times. For the prices the service should be impeccable."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch.  We'll, 15 years ago, it was great..... But not any more.    The food was beyond dreadful.  No seasoning, no herbs, not even salt and pepper!    The salads, the seafood, nothing was seasoned.  The so-called potato salad was cooked potatoes, skin on, and no dressing or seasoning of ANY kind.  The whole salmon was good.  The cooked shrimp were ok.... Hard to screw that up.    The eggs Benedict you have to order.  You wait half an hour.... And you get an uncooked egg.  You order again, wait 45 minutes, it's hard boiled.    The couple beside me had the same experience, they were in before me, so I saw it.  Desserts were ok.   Service was truly dreadful.  They definitely need more servers/staff for a room that large.   Check out the King Edward Hotel brunch, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"Bunch at Windsor Arms Hotel was a disappointment. Previous reviews indicated that the hotel had severely degraded their buffet, and ultimately themselves.  For a luxury 4 diamond hotel, Windsor Arms' services were not up to caliber. Our table was ignored for a good 10-20 minutes.  The server had failed to inform us of the made-to-order food items included in the buffet.  We were not offered juice and had to request for coffee three times. I was dumbfounded by the lack of quality, lack of selections and lack of effort. It was almost demeaning as the tables around us had visibly better services.   Windsor Arms' legendary scones were unavailable. It was filled with Dare multi-grain crackers. My dad felt the bread was stalled. My mom, however; did enjoy the chocolate-filled croissant.  The chef's idea of a Waldorf salad is green apple with greens. Traditional Waldorf salad includes apples, walnuts, celery, grapes and chicken, yet the salad at Windsor Arms was missing many of the key ingredients. Please just name it mix greens with (non)seasonal fruits, as it was FAR from a Waldorf salad  The seafood from the cold food selections were awfully frozen. Rubbery king crab legs and tasteless prawns are definitely not food items one would expect from a $50 'luxury' brunch.   Windsor Arms no longer offers waffles and pancakes in their made-to-order menu. Limited selections, coupled with serving possibility the worst Eggs Benedict in Toronto, Windsor Arms may just be the most overpriced brunch available in the GTA. Do not be deceived by my the images, the Eggs Benny was opposite of delectable. My brother's girlfriend had left a whole piece of pre-made French toast on her plate. It was a testament to how disappointing majority of the food was. The feedback for the lamb was regrettably fat and gamey.   While, my brother felt the curry chicken breast was moist and flavorful, I felt was missing a significant amount of spices found in traditional curry dishes.  The best item at the brunch was prime rib. It was moist, juicy and tender.  Just the way it should be! Another notable item was the strawberries!  HOLY GMO! They were the size of my palm! Devouring a plate of sweet and succulent strawberries with knives and forks was quite an experience.   The crème brulee had a grainy texture. The mousse was not airy. The cupcake resembled cake mix. The tiramisu lacked mascarpone and cognac. The hazelnut bombard had a strange paper aftertaste. It certainly may be an indication of its age.   Overall, I do not see myself returning to Windsor ArmsHotel. I was really hoping to fall in love with Windsor Arms; unfortunately, the brunch was appalling, the service was poor. Disgustingly dried back bacon and rock hard English muffin are things I would expect from a diner, not a hotel. It is short sighted to capitalize on small gains by downgrading offerings. Windsor Arms is sabotaging their brand equity.  A hotel with such rich history had fallen from grace....to disgrace."}
{"text":"Wow.  TERRIBLE.  My wife and i are back at the Windsor arms restaurant reliving a past weekend in Yorkville prekids.   How did this brunch get so bad.  Staff are in chaos.  Food is old and cheese etc is all stale.  Not coming back and dont see how they could even repair how bad it is.  ;-("}
{"text":"Sweet suites. Impeccable service and Great location! You want to be here.  A party every night in the ball room but no, you're not invited. Keeps the lobby lively and the quiet, quaint bar rotating conversations.  My only complaint is the the Jacuzzi tub in my suite is only big enough for two. The glass shower fits 4 but tub, 2.  The rooms are amazingly large but some faults: 1. The music did not work as demonstrated 2. The light switches were confusing 3. I rarely used the giant living room 4. My room came with a guitar and not a piano  The hotel itself was great along with Natasha in the bar. The food however, at Prime, was borderline poor. More of that in my Prime review.  Stay here. Stay here. Stay here.  It will be well worth it and I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
