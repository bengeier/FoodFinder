{"text":"Amazing! We get a pound of honey BBQ pork every time, and sometimes half a duck, to go. The men who work there are super friendly! We're never disappointed. Best BBQ pork in town, I'd say."}
{"text":"Great BBQ in the burbs. Friendly service. Took our family of 5 and had honey flavored bbq and chicken. Special fried rice and the special Chow Lai Fan. So good. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went three times to try this place but always closed early more than an hour before posted time here, sucks!"}
{"text":"Decent place with good spring rolls. Food portions were actually too large!."}
{"text":"Great good! Love the quality! Although I find the portions for the BBQ meat combo a little small! But good"}
{"text":"Best BBQ pork in the city. It's my favorite food so I know. My parents love getting bbq duck and soya sauce chicken from here. Best BBQ house in the city in my humble opinion! *****"}
{"text":"They get one star because the app disallows me from selecting zero stars. 

We got there at 7pm - prime dinner hours, they had one type of bbq meat left, and no rice.  Well, first guy checked and said there's enough rice for one box, followed by the second guy that insisted there's no rice.  Someone's Lying.

I asked for 2 lbs of whatever they had left ($9/lbs). Big mistake, they came back and charged me $24. That's $6 more (33% more), and said they cut a \"little\" too much.  What a bunch of greedy, filthy scammers.  Avoid this place unless you desire to be cheated and robbed."}
{"text":"Best Chinese BBQ in the Calgary area.  The roast pig has a nice, crispy skin full of flavor and the meat is juicy and tender.  The duck is also tasty and succulent and the soup that comes with the lunch box is savory and rich in flavor.  The biggest problem I have with this place is the service and if you don't speak perfect Mandarin or Cantonese, you will be treated with a little pretentiousness so read up before you go!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was underwhelmed by the Roast Pork and Duck from Feng Kee. The parking is limited as it is a small lot for the number and amount and type of business in the segment of this business park. It is located across from T&T & T-Pot in the North. A main test of good roast pork is the crispiness of the skin and I have to give them top marks for this but the rest of the pork was very dry. The duck too was dry. Flavour for both were ok but at the same prices I would pay anywhere else it's not worth the drive for me. I have yet to find a Chinese BBQ place that is hands down the best for everything that is traditional Chinese BBQ. I still seek the taste of the roast duck and pork that I enjoyed when living in HK and Singapore."}
{"text":"This place is small, but its by far the best BBQ pork/duck/ roast pig place I've been to. Quantity and Quality. Their lunch box is pretty good bang for the buck!! Take out is your best bet as there's only a few tables there."}
{"text":"This little BBQ house is a true find!  The BBQ Duck (Siu Ngap), BBQ Pork (Cha Siu), Soya Chicken, Sausage, Roast Pig (Siu Yoke) are all so fresh and delicious!  We tried all these meats.  We ate in their tiny restaurant (only has about 5 tables) and ordered the 3 meats with rice combo - duck, pork and soya chicken.  It comes with a free house soup and some greens on the plate.  The meat/rice combo is massive and I'd say you could share with 2 people.  There were 5 of us and we ordered 3 rice/meat plates and another plate of 3 meats - roast pork, bbq pork and sausage.  

The owners of Feng Kee used to own a BBQ house on 64 Ave NE.  And now, they've opened this small little restaurant near T&T, Harvest Hills.  They are such polite people.  The lady owner can speak English as well as Cantonese.  The 2 guys there only speak Cantonese.   

It's more of take out place and their little showcase of meats was always filled up when they run out!  When we were at the restaurant, there was  a steady of people who came in to buy their meat to take home.  Prices are so reasonable as well.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ duck in the city hands down!! $27 for a whole roasted duck ain't cheap but for what you get makes it all worth it!! The duck is all succulent meat! No skin and bones like the ducks you might get at T&T's BBQ section. (Not to mention hoping you don't get sick from their BBQ meats they didn't sell the day before. Gross!!) They are a bit slower to serve you but it's for good reason. They're constantly steady with customers throughout the day. The roasted pork is also so tasty and doesn't have that porky aftertaste to it. The place is also very clean and well kept. 5/5"}
{"text":"I have eaten one pound of BBQ pork since yesterday. No shame. My brain tells me no... But my heart says yes yes yes!!

This place is a hidden gem of the strip all, it's location keeps it out of sight, and if I hadn't gone the wrong way in the one way I wouldn't have ever found it. 

The employees here are extreamly friendly, and I love how they accept credit cards without a minimum! They have a paper menu in English with a variety of stir fried dishes. So don't get too intimidated by the Chinese menu plaques on the counter.

I will be back... Later in the week... Never mind... Maybe tonight."}
{"text":"What a great little spot!  A co-worker suggested this place to me for their BBQ duck as I had mentioned to him that I don't like TnT's duck.  Well I had to finally try it for myself last night.  
It's a small place and has the BBQ pork and duck hanging in the case when you walk in.  They don't seem to speak very good English but the owner was there and translated for me.  I ordered the special fried rice (duck, pork, egg, shrimp), green beans with black bean sauce and beef and 1/2 BBQ duck to go.
The portions are huge so no worries about feeding a few people.  It fed my husband and myself and I even brought some for lunch today and still have leftovers at home. The BBQ duck is amazing..crispy skin and great flavor.  I have to say that I thought everything tasted even better today as left overs."}
{"text":"Super tasty bbq'd goodies and their lunch combo cannot be beat. It costs a little more than T and T but if prefer to help out an independent that deserves it when their product is this good. 

I haven't tried their sit-down menu yet but every time I pop in the food looks good. Very thankful they opened up shop."}
