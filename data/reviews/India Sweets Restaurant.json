{"text":"Cosey place serving home style indian meals, recommended to me by my Indian friend.  Their lunch combos are good."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised at the positive reviews about this place.  I got food poisoning from this food and I'm not one to get sick easily.  It also didn't taste good at all, and was too oily. Beware!"}
{"text":"Great deal on the Samosas, I believe it's 3 for $1 now (I think it used to be 4/1). Soft, flakey, and just the right amount of spice/filling. Both the tamarind (red) and the green sauce are AMAZING, I usually pour a bunch on to my samosas! The sweets are nice as well. If you are unfamiliar with Indian sweets (the food, not the restaurant), they are often very sweet, but a bit different from candy / chocolate here in North America. Yes, some of them look like timbits, but they don't taste anything like timbits. You can buy per pound, and in small quantities, if you are unsure. 

The actual dinner food here is excellent as well. Great naan, paneer, chana bathura (sp?) and other curries. I've never tried the lunch buffet; we usually get takeout for dinner if anything. We've been eating here for many years, and my family has never once been disappointed. Whenever there are potlucks/ get togethers at work or with friends, we will gladly pick up 30-50 samosas from here (the price is too good to beat!) and there are NEVER left overs. If you order in large quantities, make sure you call ahead though!

As a side note, the owners are very nice and friendly people too, which always helps :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place so much! The butter chicken was the best I've ever had! Now the sauce is not as thick and the taste is different."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I live so I come here often to fill my Indian food cravings! You get 3 samosas for $1 which is great! And their paneer curries are amazing! I usually go with the veggie thali. Their rice portion is quite small but you have naan to make up for that (I personally prefer the naan) and 3 curries of your choice all for a great deal! During Diwali I always gotta stop by to stock up on their yummy desserts as well!"}
{"text":"Nice place small buffer great for veg's - visit once a month veggies thali $6 better than a mac"}
{"text":"The process leading up to my visit every time, without fail:

- I drive by, not hungry;
- I stop in because it's convenient; 
- I've already pulled into the parking lot, so I must be peckish for one little samosa;
- I'm delighted once again at the price: 3 vegetarian samosas for $2;
- I am a frugal Asian and must take advantage of a good deal;
- I buy 6 samosas.

Oh woe is me.

But seriously now, these SAMOSAS are phenomenal. These are not the shell-so-hard-it-will-cut-the-roof-of-your-mouth variety; nor the where-on-earth-is-the-filling-oh-wait-there-I-see-it variety. 

These heavenly palm-sized pillows have an almost flaky shell & while they make little grease windows in the paper bags, India Sweets manages to make the grease barely noticeable on your palate & fingers. the best part is, they are STUFFED plump with a piping hot potato, pea, spice filling. I've even had one heated up a few days later in the toaster oven and still, the filling, shell - awesome. 

Minus 0.5 stars due the hours which are set but different almost every day, due to their catering requirements I think. Not the easiest place to go to for a random late evening snack."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for some real deal good, no frills Indian food with reasonable prices. We all know Indian food caters to both vegetarians and meat eaters.  This is where the locals are at, so it's legit. 

Great Channa bhatura and veg curries. Flavours are on point. Bhatura and naans are great and not super oily.

I'll be back to check the nonveg options. 

Place looked clean, it's close to home. Will definitely be back. It's perfect for a night where you want to give yourself (or your amazing home cook) a night off."}
{"text":"*NEW OWNERS*** I used to love this restaurant, it was close to home and I often used it for catering my small to mid sized events. 

The new ownership is extremely rude (not just to myself, but to others I know) and they have raised the prices on almost every item on the menu. 

I will no longer be visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"Looove it!! Favorite Indian food place! Amazing taste for every thing on menu! Love malai kofta. Amazing price for vegetable thali."}
{"text":"The best Indian dhaba in the area, although that's not saying much. The owner is a total curry nazi, but his Chana Bhatura & goat curry is on point."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on our way to Whittamore Farm to find a Halloween pumpkin, and glad we did.  

Sadly, my wife and I eat out on average at least once a day.  And, it's often very difficult to find a place with great home cooking tasting food.  This place definitely fills that gap.

Very small, but friendly place with really great food at great prices.

We had the vegetable bariyani, vegetable samosas, aloo palak, naan and chicken tikka.

If in the area again, we'd probably stop back in."}
{"text":"This is a small family run resturant. The food is really fantastic. Prices are reasonable. I go here once every two weeks."}
{"text":"There's a new owner and this place has gone downhill really quick. 

* Very slow, and rude service. On one occasion, I placed my order with the older gentleman at the front. He took my payment (debit) and went to the back to tell the kitchen my order. When he came to the front, he accused me of not paying until I pointed out the the debit machine receipt (still attached to the payment device!)

* The prices do not reflect what is advertised on the menu. They'll come to a random figure and expect you to not ask any questions. Also, they charge more for eating in, despite the lackluster service and dirty cutlery. 

* The receipt is not itemized, they'll push whatever button their finger touches first on the register. Need to claim a work lunch? Try explaining $45 on 'Soda.'"}
{"text":"Good India food, well worth the price. I go to get take out but a dine in experience would be nice as well. 

I always order a naan and channa combo which is only $5.50. (For 4 pieces of naan and a medium container of curry chick peas. The flavour of the curry is a very mild spice and the naan is always nicely baked. 

This place is an affordable way to feed the family at a restaurant without spending a lot of money. Great food and great price."}
