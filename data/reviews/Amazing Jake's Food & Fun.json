{"text":"It looks like a great place to play yet the day we went the line to get in was super long. Don't think there was enough staff. The lines for the rides were long and bumper cars only had 4 of the 6 working. Felt like all we were doing was standing in lines.  The buffet was good. Nice choice of food and locations to eat within Amazing Jakes."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read Monique's review before booking my son's birthday party here. A friend of mine had her daughter's birthday party here in September and she tried to talk me out of it because it was so busy, but I thought since her daughter's party also happened to fall on Ramadan that was why it was so busy. Boy, was I wrong. My experience was almost exactly like Monique's (read her review on here on 12/20/10) only I do have to say the waitress did ask a lot of questions but I don't blame her she was only like 16, but I do blame the management for the constant questions throughout the party. We only had our room for 1 1/2 hrs and then were shifted into the sports bar area to finish it out because they needed the room. We also paid for the most expensive tickets for many of the guests and found out that the kids only got to ride 1 or 2 rides in the time we had there because it was so packed. The food was ok but either parents need to supervise their kids better in the food area or workers need to clean up more often because it got rather filthy. We took our son here to have a memorable party and the next day he asked if next year we could just take him to Peter Piper Pizza instead. I really wish we would have this time, it would have saved us over $200.
A young lady did call about a week later to see how our experience was there and I when I told the her what had happened (I was very nice to her and just gave her the facts) she was pretty upset and said she would have a manager call me back and maybe they could give us tickets to come back another time. It's been almost a month and I have yet to hear from anyone there. Obviously management doesn't care. Needless to say, we will never be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Long lines for a short amount of fun. 20 dollars per person (with a coupon) didn't even cover the cost for all the arcade games. I wish I would have gone to Peter piper pizza. Then I wouldn't have to pay just to sit and watch. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and they wouldn't accept my bill because it was wrinkly. Most of the games they had were out of order. The food was alright but not enough choices"}
{"text":"I got a groupon and we really had a lot of fun. We went on a Fri afternoon. Not to busy which was great. Food was good. Glad there was a salad bar. Food was fresh. Games and rides were good. Wish there were more attendants and I wish the groupon stated that the unlimited games only referred to video games not ticket games. It makes sense but was not clear. I will only come on a groupon. It's really pricey."}
{"text":"Horrible, terrible foodborne illness.

Shoulda turned back when I saw a kid put his whole fist into a jello after wiping his nose. Sure, they replaced it, but... one person manning a three mile long buffet cannot snuff out all the snots.

How bad was it you say? Oh, well, when the PARAMEDICS showed up at my house, they thought I was a goner. During the ambulance ride I profusely vomited on, and shat on, the sexy EMT. The sexy ones always show up when you are projectile... anything. Almost ten hours and two bags of fluid later, I was allowed to leave the hospital.

\"Oh, but Anna,\" you say. \"How could you have possibly known this unfortunate illness was the result of excessively greasy pizza, premade salad and buffet style fruit?\" Well, the neighbors who had gone around the same time also spent a few days wrestling for the toilet. If we could sell explosive baby poop, we would have been in business. Amazing Jakes was the only food within a week that we all shared... I'm going to go ahead and place the blame there.

That pizza tastes exactly the same coming up 24 hours later. 

Thanks there Amazing Jakes. I am now thoroughly terrified to set foot in a buffet place again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We took advantage of the $19.99 all day deal.  You get all you can eat buffet - with a decent variety of choice's pizza, salad, potato bar, warm cookies and more. Plus there is Laser tag, bowling, tons of video games of all kinds. We spent almost 3 to 4 hours there and were almost disappointed we had to leave.  Great for kids of all ages - nice sitting eating areas away from the game and running around. Particularly loved the theatre area.  Restrooms were clean and appeared well serviced.And the staff , while it seemed  a bit thin , were friendly helpful and not a problem.  Overall a very good experience  we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A great place for fun.. the food not so much. - My children had a blast. They range from 5-18 and it was fun for the entire family. We went on a Tuesday and got the \"Family Speciall\" where you can eat, drink, and play all day for $19.99 - I don't what the normal cost would have been, but the price was unbeatable for all they offered, It wasn't crowed - the little children could go from ride to ride w/o any problem and the bowling was fun"}
{"text":"Our family of 14 had a great time here. We used the Winter Break special for $13 (3 hrs play) + $5 for full day play. Not bad at all for several hours of entertainment & food for under $20 a person! Keeping this short, the kids had a lot of fun and we would definitely come back. I would recommend this establishment to friends & family."}
{"text":"My name is Kennedy and my mommy planned a birthday party for me at Amazing Jakes. I turned 3 years old. My mommy and her best friend visited AJ 1 week before my birthday party. They went over billing, which room the party would be located in, decorations, games/rides and took a tour. My mommy also asked for a special request for my birthday. She asked if they could play my favorite cartoon Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. This is my favorite cartoon, it draws my attention the most and makes me laugh. You see friends, I was diagnosed with Autism moderate-severe earlier this year, and I've also had numerous visits to Urgent Care/ER most of this year, surgery, and I have speech and language therapy weekly. Anyways, it's been a rough year for me and my family so it was really important to my mommy that I have an \"Amazing\" birthday party. After all, you only turn 3 once and we wanted to have a great time. My mommy spoke to a manager named Amy who provided us with good news initially. She told my mommy that she will be able to make an accommodation and play my favorite cartoon during my party so I can laugh and dance. She kept her promise and on the day of my party I walked into the room and Daniel Tiger was on the big screen. Big smiles. Here is where it went bad. Upon arrival my mommy already made the reservation and a deposit so she was ready to pay the bill as soon as we got there. The cashier told her no and that they will take payment at the end of the party, so my mommy proceeded to pay for helium to have my 5 Daniel Tiger Balloons blown up and then we were taken to our party area. The party host (who wasn't very good and kept my mommy's attention on him instead of me during my whole party) kept asking questions and following my mommy around. He finally asked us what type of pizza and drinks we wanted and left to get them. While he was gone my mommy was finally able to begin greeting all of my friends and guests who arrived. The party host brought the pizza and drinks and also brought the game cards out for me and my friends. After we finished with pizza my mommy had to clean all the tables, carry trays and remove dirty dishes because the Party Host primary concern was more about the bill and money vs my party and my cake. He returned with a $400 bill and offered to take my mommy's debit card to the front. I stayed with my family while my mommy and best friend went to the front to discuss the error. Apparently, every guest that had arrived was being added to the bill and took HOURS for the Amazing Jakes team to sort out. AJ took the 10 cards away and held onto them even though they were included in the reservation price + tax that my mommy asked to pay in the beginning, but was advised to wait till the end. The issue should've been resolved quickly and not take HOURS and keeping my mommy away from the party and the game cards away from me (The Birthday Girl) and the other 10 kids. The issues with the bill took so long my mommy had to carry the cake in, search for a knife to cut the cake and come serve it when that was the Party Hosts job. Instead he stayed and argued with my family and guests along with the manager during that shift. The party was horrible and not amazing at all. Oh yeah, I finally got 5/10 cards at the end of the party but everyone was tired, and drained and ready to go home and it wasn't because it was fun. After a week of reporting bad service to the mangers at AJ, a general manager told my mommy there is nothing they will do. No sorry, no remorse, no refund. 

My Mom, family, friends, and by standers who witnessed this terrible service said that from now on we will have my birthday parties at another place so I can have an Amazing experience.

{"text":"Do not go for casual fun!!! Mandatory $10 per admission  per person (because they force their awful buffet food to make money) games are not worth the $10 admission, let alone the $3 PER RIDE. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Very trashy place. Staff is best described as numb.  One sad little play area for toddlers and it was over run with much older kids.  Nothing positive to say."}
{"text":"This place is so un organized it's crazy. You wait 45 minutes in line just to get in, then if you decide to eat first you wait another 30 minutes to get your food. Then when you get a two hour game time you get to play 5 games since those lines are 30 minute waits. There is a lot of things the owners could do to change this process. I would not return unless they changed a lot of things. The kids had fun on their 5 rides but even they complained and said it was not worth it. They would rather play at the park for two hours they said."}
{"text":"Best place to take kids ages 5-99. Bowling, rides, laser tag, games and a delicious buffet and dessert bar. Their Mac n cheese is delish, and they have a great salad bar and yummy Pizza too. Check out their website for promos! Two thumbs up for this place."}
{"text":"We bought groupons for $15 for 3 hours unlimited buffet, rides, video games, laser tag and bowling.  It was worth it for the price.  Buffet was better than expected with pizza, salad bar, baked potato bar, pasta bar and dessert bar.  Didn't try pasta As it looked sticky and mushy.  Salad bar was fantastic as were the baked potatoes.  Pizza and dessert bar were okay.  My son spent most of his time playing video games.  Having video games unlimited is the way to go as the machines are numerous and are the main feature.  Didn't do go karts as line was long and son wasn't tall enough to drive on his own.  Need to be 58\". Bumper cars and laser tag were fun.  Eat buffet either before you swipe your game cards or after times up so you have more activity time.  Don't think I would pay full price for the place but the groupon made it worth it.  Also check website for weekday specials... they don't tell you about them and will charge you full price."}
{"text":"Good place indoor place to go with the family!
Great when they have specials or coupons but not for full price!
Food tastes pretty good but we end up sick every time we go there and eat! EVERY TIME!
Birthday Parties are way too expensive!
Games are over priced too
All in all a lot of things under one roof
Food, rides, games, laser tag, bowling, movies. Great concept just needs some help!"}
{"text":"This place is not appropriate for children under 3. There are really only 3 little rides they can  go on and no one was working those rides so we had to wait a while and track someone down to let us on. Certainly not worth the money. I thought that they had a large climbing area for the little ones, but sadly they do not. Buffet was mediocre at best and the place in general is wayyyy over priced. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Came at lunch time. Ate while watching kids movies. Played games for 3 hours. Finished with bowing. Dinner time. Ate again. Finished with dessert. Left. What a great day!"}
{"text":"Expensive and kinda dirty... The food is alright... Some of the kids that work there are rude and dont care... My kids really like it though so thats worth something"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Super clean, great buffet selection and wonerful staff!  Kudos to the management and staff running this place."}
{"text":"This place is great for kids, we went and had a blast!!!"}
{"text":"Some of my coworkers thought I was crazy when I wanted to go to lunch at Mesa's Amazing Jakes to celebrate my birthday a couple years ago. And they were right to a certain extent. I was definitely crazy to want to eat there. My pizza was cold and looked like something out of a grade school cafeteria and the food buffet was not appetizing in the least.

But we ended up having one of the best lunches ever after we ate. Some of us rocked \"Dance Dance Revolution\" and we killed at Skee-Ball. And I even talked some friends into riding the carousel.  Infact it was hard to leave Amazing Jakes and go back to work.

While this may not make the greatest lunch destination, it's certainly a fun time for those wanting to be a kid again or a cool place to take kids."}
{"text":"I went here for a work event today. We had unlimited access to the buffet and got to play all of the arcade games, bowl, go-cart, etc. Everything was as expected; full of events for kids and decent food. Their salads were my favorite (especially being a veg). They come with a wide variety of veggies and dressings.

Their rides were all fine. Some had minor issues as expected. All of the arcade games worked great.

It's a cool place to take your kids. I wouldn't suggest anything past that."}
{"text":"Should be called Ghetto Jakes.. this place is a joke. It is dirty, run down and crowded. None of the staff I interacted with smiled. Especially the ones handling the rides. Must be a terrible place to work at! As for the building, I am not sure what they are investing the income into, but it sure is not the experience. For around $20 a person, you get 3 hours of unlimited rides (cheap, long lines, for smaller kids (5 and under) bowling (if you can get a lane) arcade games (if you can FIND ANY THAT WORK!) and the \"lets see if I can get food poisoning\" buffet.  It does not include any games that would issue you tickets for prizes, which those are the ones that seem to be in the best shape.  I went with the kids, and every other game we tried to play either did not work, was turned off, missing pieces or held together with duct tape. Everything was dirty, I felt like I need a Purell bath afterwards. Save your hard earned money for a place that actually cares about their business and customers."}
{"text":"Meh. It's okay, but definitely not worth the money. You're better off going to Dave & Buster's. You will get a better experience for significantly less money."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here until today. Half the games are broken. They take your money or don't give you tickets. The food is always good but today I ate a rotten cucumber and lost my appetite. Not that they can help it but there were some horrible kids there this time. Kicking. Bitting. Screaming. Not a fun time this time.  I hope they spend a little more on maintenence."}
{"text":"Checked the website and saw that the best specials were on days other than Wednesday so I figured it would be a great time to go so that it wouldn't be as crowded. WRONG!!! Drove 45 miles one way and as soon as I paid almost $100 for 3 kids I realized that the multiple buses outside were empty and that the over 800 kids and staff were inside Amazing Jakes! The entire place was taken over... extremely long lines for all games and activities. Buffet was picked over and completely unappetizing! Took a break and went in the movie area... it was so noisy it wasn't a break at all. Amazing Jakes did a real disservice to other customers who paid full price. It should have been closed for the \"private party\".  Price is unreasonable for 1 hour of entertainment instead of the 3 hours paid for."}
{"text":"my grandkids love this place and the food is OK but the bowling and carts are the fun part of it"}
{"text":"I took my kids here for the first time yesterday & they had a blast!  It's pretty expensive, as with some sort of summer deal it was still $22 for each of us & that didn't include bowling nor any of the paid games & the food is awful. I mean really, really, really bad but I'm giving it four stars because, like I said, my kids had a great time.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time with the kids. All the kids were polite, the problem was the adults. They are the ones that cut in line in front of the kids and push their kids to cut. Maybe the kids should teach their parents some manners!"}
{"text":"I came here on a school night.  There were no crowds, but we did see what looked like a crowd of teenaged football players.  The atmosphere was o-kay.  The thing I did not like most about this place was what they considered their buffet.  Everything tasted old and as if it was they were trying to get rid of the last inventory of food they had in their \"kitchen\" before the weekend crowd was going to roll in the next day.  Ill give it a half-star for the kids at least having fun there.  I will think about going back again."}
{"text":"This place is fun and has lots to do,but....The lines are crazy.I waited 40 minutes for the go karts!Unbelievable!Also the food is kind of bad.Other wise this place is really nice!"}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY...Better to do a Dollar cinema and save $90 more bucks. Buffet was Shockingly BAD. Overcooked meatless mush. Every ride is 1 HOUR Wait. I drove for an hour with large family. Next time I'll do AZ AIR TIME !!"}
{"text":"Brought my son and some other kids here for his 4th birthday. All in all, I thought it was a good value.  The kids all had a very good time. The food wasn't what I would normally eat, but it was better than I had expected. The pizza was definitely better than the couple of other buffet-style pizza places I have tried and also better than the other 2 kiddie pizza places I have tried. There were of a few other options for food and dessert which weren't bad either, and a big unlimited beverage selection. The play area seemed pretty clean, especially for the large amount of people there that day. The rides appeared to be in good repair. The ride operators and other workers were the typical apathetic teenagers you get at these places, but nothing was left unattended. Despite the parking lot being almost full, there was plenty of room to sit our fairly large party and eat in one of the themed rooms, the game area didn't feel overcrowded, and the ride lines were never long. The place is a lot bigger inside than it looks from outside. Overall, good experience.  If I was a 4 year old it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible place to eat. Pizza tasted nasty and stale. Games are overpriced. One of my family members showed up just to sit with us and enjoy our family time and they wanted to charge him $10.99 Save yourself the trouble and go to Dave & Busters. You'll enjoy yourself a lot more and the food is a lot better."}
{"text":"Fun place but seriously needs a deep cleaning. Bowling is not included in the fun pass. That was a bummer. Food is decent. Prices are a little high and the arcade games are way overpriced."}
{"text":"Took the kids and wife here for a day of fun.  Cost 77 bucks for 2 adults 1 kid 1 baby. For my money I got all you can eat and play and ride. Was it worth the money? Food beat expectations rides were fun games all worked.if you need a place that will keep the kids happy and serves good food this place will fill the bill plus they serve beer if that matters to you and it was clean.thanks for making my family day happy much appreciated"}
{"text":"The food is terrible. The manager is a jerk. The employees I dealt with were rude. If you ever have to talk with the staff or management about a problem, you won't get anywhere. My advice, take the kids somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is really great!! I mean, there is something for all ages, including adults. The buffet is in my opinion much better than sweet tomatoes, and several dollars less. All of the activities are fun for kids, and the place has many attentive employees. You can grab a drink and watch a football game with your family, then go on a roller coaster all in the same building! Really, I can't understand any of the negative reviews, especially considering how inexpensive this place is compared to most \"fun places\" out there for families. For all other reviews complaining about the \"admission\" cost- that actually covers the buffet meaning you could come to this place to eat with your whole family for CHEAPER than going to any restaurant that I can think of. Yes, you pay extra to play the games, but it is well worth it considering all you get! I am assuming anyone just paying to enter and not taking advantage of the meal is just ignorant to the fact that it's all inclusive"}
{"text":"Not worth the money!  After paying $30 for an all day pass I find out that my son is a 1/4\" short to drive the go carts, are you serious?  This place is supposed to be for kids?  I guess the kids working here didn't get the memo!   It's 10am and this place has 10 people inside.  That should have been a clue.  I'll never come back."}
{"text":"The kids had fun. 
The actual customer service experience was awful.
This place is huge with many different areas. Each and every area we went to we had some sort of problem. You can't just go in either. So I had to pay a fee to attend a birthday party. And then once informed I purchased the wrong package they had to do a refund but didn't refund my entire amount and I still had to pay more?? Don't know what's going on there.
Had to wait in lines forever and they kept letting people in front of our party. Food looked sketchy, my bf had stomach pains the rest of the night cuz of it.
All of the staff was distracted and under trained. 
Fun for the kiddos, but get better experience and save a whole lot more money by opting for somewhere else like Dave n Busters."}
{"text":"This is definitely a nice place but their advertising is not true to what they offer. 2 out of 9 rides we paid for were broken and the manager, Rachel did not even acknowledge it. She simply said that things break.
 Also, this place has 5 go karts and therefore 45 mins wait for each round. They require the kids to stay in line and that is a hellish experience when kids get tired. They are v strict about it.

If you want to come.here for go karts and have access to other options, consider your other options.  This place does not offer a good experience. 

Their 5 dollar unlimited video game is only applicable to certain games but they do not tell u upfront. Even their employees do not understand well what is going on. We asked 3 different people and got many different answers. Found it through trial and error.

Again, this can be a great place but it is not well managed. I wish I could leave with a better experience and rating but the manager was not very caring about customer experience."}
{"text":"I'll give this a 4 star rating.

People need to learn to have an expectation and what you should expect is that there are tons of kids running around (after all, this place is pretty much an attraction for kids!) and you can expect that by the end of the day, it won't be perfect.

We have done birthdays here before and the party room experience blows...it's all rush, rush, rush.  Today, we jus had our daughters 5 birthday and, knowing the issues we have had in the past, we planned around it.

Instead of getting a party room, we got there right when the place opened (10:00 am). We chose a spot  in one of the rooms and and set up camp. We had about 15 people with us, so we did take up a bit of room.  With the buffet and the \"all day\" pass (which really only lasts 3 hours), it cost about 15 bucks a person.

Being there early, we learned the place starts getting slammed around noon, we had a great time. The lines were not too long, the food was coming out pretty fresh and hot, and the kids were having a good time. The staff is always friendly and they do their best.

We hung out until about 2 and got out of the before it got too crazy.


If you expect great food, your gong to be disappointed. It's a quantity over quality thing with this place. Food will not be super great, bu kids will be happy...and I always eat enough to be full."}
{"text":"I am taking away a point for 2 reasons. There are only 2 or 3 people running the rides so the operators go back and forth between them as a line forms. They should have one person per ride to avoid the wait since there is a 3 hr time limit to stay there. Also, for whatever reason the swipe cards did not work on many of the video games. Those two complaints noted, the rest of the place was AMAZING. The Gkids loved it, the food was pretty darn good...WONDERFUL salad bar, soups, pizza ( less crust more topping would be better), pasta bar ( spaghetti could use more sauce)  ice cream, pastries AND adult beverages!! We saved lots of money by going on a Groupon and will go back again when the kids come back into town."}
{"text":"This place is definitely fun but really overpriced. For as much as they are charging,  I expected better buffet choices (nasty pizza, salad bar, baked potatoe, pasta and of course cookies and soft serve). Not only is the admission ridiculous but the games are pricey too and so are the prizes. I would only come here for special occasions but other than that, I would stick to GolfLand, PeterPiper Pizza or even Chuck e Cheese if you're looking for a decent pizza and gaming for the little ones."}
{"text":"Salad bar was really good. Activities are good. crowded!! Almost like Disneyland Wait. Video games OK. Good place to take kids."}
{"text":"If you want to over pay for mediocre fun and food this is the place for you. It is actually quite pricy considering you have to pay admission on top of having to play games. We bought a couple fun passes on top of that to wait over an hour just to ride go karts in a small circle. I wish for the price they could upgrade the entertainment value and food."}
{"text":"The food: So-so selection. Not very good tasting, but whatever. It's not gourmet, so what can I expect? They have pizza and kids like pizza, so whatever. The ice cream is terrible though. They really should get soft serve and not that weird stuff they serve...

The customer service: Not very friendly staff. Distracted. Not helpful.

The complaint: I took my 1 year old on the carousel, and like another reviewer before me, the employee started the ride as I was adjusting the belt. It moves fast (if you're standing) and it's a jerking start. That's dangerous, but not so much as the second incident. My daughter went on the roller coaster ride that goes in a circle. No clue what it's called. The girl running it did not check to make sure anyone was buckled in, and went to start the ride... with my child unbuckled! Luckily I caught it and stopped her so my child could buckle up. It's not a difficult job. Check first! An accident on that ride could KILL someone! The complete lack of concern from the employees is terrifying. I realize they need to get through a line (although with both incidents it was the end of the night, so no real lines anymore), but safety should come BEFORE speed."}
{"text":"If you are having a bday be prepared to spend a lot of money. The games are $1.00 a piece and the basic package comes with $5.00 worth of credits for each kid. Basically all the kids at the birthday will spend this money in the first ten minutes and you'll be spending the rest of the party dishing out money  to keep them happy. Total racket."}
{"text":"My Kids love this place.  The prices really are not bad, if you look for deals.  You can often get unlimited games and fun for a few hours for a decent rate.   The food is below average.  Pizza is just ok and not a ton of options.  Best thing is the salad bar, hard to mess this up. 

Great place to take the kids..good place for bday parties as well"}
{"text":"$10 for all you can eat buffet while waiting for the kids to play is not that bad. Family Tuesday is the best day to go. Great place for birthday parties."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to try this place out due to bad reviews, I'm glad I didn't listen. Took my 9 year old with her 6 cousins all day Saturday. We had a blast, even my one year old who just had a small area to play in. The place is huge and it's worth the money for sure."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday and got a special on the Fun Pass. The pass included 3 hours of unlimited rides: Bumper Cars, Go Karts, Laser Tag, Rollercoaster and bowling. We actually ended up bowling passed the 3 hours and they didn't say anything to us. The pass also came with a buffet. All we paid was $12 each and I have to say it was well worth it. They have a section called movie mania that has 3 different kid movies playing at all times. When we went they were airing How to Train a Dragon 2, Frozen and Finding Nemo. There's tables spread out through the mini theater so you can eat while you watch. Next door to the movie section was the Sports zone. You can eat in there too! They were showing the NBA Draft, UFC fights, Nascar racing and baseball all at the same time. We ate before we got on the rides and after. We were so full at the end of the night! The pizza wasn't the best but it did the job. The Mac and cheese was disappointing cause it was cold and not very cheesy at all. I had to put a ton of cheese on top of it from the salad bar. I did enjoy the baked potatoes and desserts. Overall we had a great time and will definently be coming back. This was our 2nd time here. The 2nd time was even better than the first! Next time we come I'm going to get the unlimited arcade games for 3 hours pass for only $15."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  At least that's what my mother always told me.  And at Amazing Jake's, that's basically the truth.  I recently went for a 5-year-old's birthday party.  The kids seemed to have a great time, playing cheesy arcade games (you know, the kind where you earn tickets to redeem for crappy prizes later on), and riding the carnival-style rides.  It's basically like a Chuck E. Cheese, but bigger.  MUCH bigger.  Of course, everything costs extra (games, bowling, mini-golf, laser tag), but that's to be expected.  The party I attended included an all-you-can-eat buffet (mostly kid-friendly food - not great, but not horrible) and a card that allowed \"unlimited\" rides (there were four that our little guy could go on).

This is definitely a place geared towards kids.  If you keep that in mind, it's a decent place to take kids on a hot summer afternoon in Arizona, but nothing special.  I don't really recommend it for a birthday party, since they force you to stay in the \"birthday room\" for the first 90 minutes.  They don't even hand out the \"fun cards\" until after the food, cake, and presents.  Seriously, what kid wants to stay in a room when they can see a bunch of rides and games through the large window??"}
{"text":"It's a mixed bag. The place could use some clean up and food can be of better quality but you get what you pay for. It is a lot of value for money specially when they have the coupons and deals. Sign up for their coupons by email and enjoy the deals."}
{"text":"I went to amazing jakes the weekend it opened in 2005 and have made a point to visit often. It's like Chuck E Cheese invaded a Cost Co. It's huge and has more for grown ups to do. 

There's an all you can eat buffet with pizza, pasta, salad, soups and desert. There are multiple \"themed\" dining areas... Sports, movies, outdoor patio, Italian bistro etc. the food isn't spectacular but it isn't bad. 

They have a wine and beer stand which is amazing. 

In terms of entertainment they offer an assortment of video games, laser tag, a rock climbing wall, bowling, and various rides like bumper cars and mini-coasters. 

It's full of potential for fun! 

The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is the utter level of decay this place has fallen into. Rips and stains in the carpeting and booth seats. Chipped walls, warped silverware and plates. Everything is sticky. The games are dated and haven't been updated in a long while. Half of the laser tag packs are down. I understand that the economy has lent itself to a certain level of belt tightening but this is a path to closing for good. 

Being back the amazing that once was, instead of \"sticky jakes\" as my husband and I now refer to it as."}
{"text":"I have tried this place on several occasions over the years and every time I leave regretting it.
It is ridiculously over priced and every time they get an idea to update their 1980's stuff, the price goes up even more. I took 2 kids and myself and the bill on a Wednesday was almost $70. That is insane. The food is just old and sitting there. Finding an employee for a question is impossible, have to go to the front. The TV room for kids literally smells like someone peed in the corner. It is bad, I have the worst sense of smell.

Clearly, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service considering the price for a kid's party. Once we gave the party rep her $40 tip she was gone. No further service. No utensils to serve cake. No cups. No water. No service. Last thing...you can't take any left over pizza you've paid for, that was part of the package, home. I was told by some snot nose, in other words youngster, manager that the cost of the party was for the use of the room. Ridiculous! I should have asked to speak with the real manager. Oh well. Never going there again. Don't  bother. Stick with Peter Pipers or Chuckie Cheeses. Better service. Longer parties. Cheaper cost. Food is just as good and the kids have a blast.

Update to review. Be careful. They also steal your credit card information and charge up large amounts. I had to close an account. I should have realized something suspicious when the girl took so long to bring my card back."}
{"text":"The kids had fun and I left broke. Your pass includes unlimited bowling but not the shoes, that's extra. Your pass includes unlimited video games but not the ones that give you tickets, for that you need to purchase a $10 game card. 
The staff was nice but the food was just ok. 
It was over a $100 for 3 kids and one non-playing adult for a few hours. I don't think we will be back at that price."}
{"text":"This place has lost its allure! The place although busy every time I have ever been is seriously understaffed. They have 3 ride operators for 5 rides, so you have to wait until they rotate and if anyone goes on break or to the restroom you will be waiting even longer. The ticket counter had one guy working it and he was working the bowling alley. My daughter waited 45 minutes in the line to redeem 350 tickets, it was ridiculous. This was on a Thursday afternoon. The time before this I went, I encountered the same situation, my daughter waited 45 minutes to do laser tag because only half of the vest were working, they were out of pizza and ice cream cones and we had to wait between ride operators. I went to find the manager and his response was someone will be there to run the ride when they can be there! For $25 per kid I expect way more, I would rather go to Castle and Coasters anytime."}
{"text":"1.5 hours in line (behind 24 people) for go-karts!   Slow broken down equipment... Lazy slow staff.
Not fun."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place with my family. It is like a small carnival but indoors. They even provide you with food, all you can eat. Don't expect gourmet but pizzas, cookies, salad and ice cream kept the kids quite happy.

Games, cosmic bowling type lanes, rides and prizes! I even likes the place as an adult! Ha ha. 

A definite cool spot for the entire family on the hot Arizona summer days."}
{"text":"This place is a given if you have kids and find yourself in the East Valley...

The food isn't the best, but it is edible.  This review is more about the total experience. To comment just on the food doesn't do the place justice...

I'd rather spend an afternoon here then at Chuck E. Cheese any day..."}
{"text":"Be very careful and Hang On to your Credit Cards !!!  We have reason to believe that the waitress that took care of our Grand daughters Birthday Party stole our credit card number !!  She needs to be put in jail !!"}
{"text":"I held my child's second birthday there. I paid $300 to have only a 90 min room then got kicked out. Had to go to public side to eat and open up gifts. It's nothing special with a few balloons.  I paid for 20 people and 12 showed so they didn't want to refund my $ for the difference. The host just brings extra napkins and keeps track of the time in room then kicks you out right at time she says which is only 20 min like I said. Not well managed at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a soda to go. Not happening. No soda to go. Could have bought the buffet line and got the soda for 8.99. Price does not include the plastic cup. So if your dropping on in for a soda to go, forget about it."}
{"text":"Similar to John's Universe in California, but better. They had a bowling alley, a mini grand prix, and laser tag. And they even had an eating area that played 3 different movies. 

The place was clean. And it wasn't very stuffy. The games are spread out far enough so you're not bumping into people. 

Great for birthday parties. They had little party rooms in the arcade area."}
{"text":"I stopped going here a year ago because the food is not what it once was. It's a great place for kids though if you want to spend a lot of money. I just wish parents of today what teach their kids investing vs. Playing video games."}
{"text":"No one really cares about this place I'm so surprised it hasn't been shut down do to food inspection it would diff NOT PASS it's so nasty"}
{"text":"My one year old son was almost injured on the carousel due to the carelessness of the employee operating the ride. My son and I, along with a few of our other family members got on the ride. I was in the process of adjusting the seatbelt as it was too big for him when the ride suddenly began to run. It was a quick start and I almost let go of my son while trying to get my balance. I yelled \"Hey stop!\" and the man just looked at us as if he couldn't do anything about it. Once our turn was done we got off and I observed another group of kids get on. I noticed again that he didn't check if all of their seat belts were on too. After that I talked to a manager up front and told her about what had happened. I saw her go to him and speak to him but after she left I saw the same guy distracted during another carousel round. He was just talking to a coworker with his back turned on what he should have been attending to. A carousel is not a dangerous ride but this type of carousel is the kind where if a child falls off and rolls towards the middle, they could be smashed between the spinning part and the middle glass piece.

With that being said, I also give Amazing Jake's a low review because the pizzas were cold and most of the food bar was empty, even when there was more than an hour until closing time.

Employees should be retrained on their customer service skills as that is the business they're in and chose to be in (if it's such an inconvenience for you to do your job, then don't work there! Simple as that.) And more importantly their effort to help parents keep their kids safe."}
{"text":"We have been here at least a half dozen times.  I think the food is really good for a pizza buffet place.  I love the macaroni and cheese or the alfredo pasta.  The baked potato bar is delicious.  My kids like the soups.  The salad bar is good.  Everything is fresh and they have a nice assortment of toppings.  Since the last time I went they reduced some of the salad options that I liked- feta cheese, blue cheese crumbles, baby corn, ect.  The pizza choices are interesting and mostly good.  The beverage bar is above average as well.  I have to agree with a previous reviewer about the desserts... ick!  the kids like it though so I guess it is okay to save me the calories and fat of indulging in dessert.  :) I think the $7.99 for an adult lunch Monday- Thurs. or Friday and $5.99 for kids- 3 and under eat free is very reasonable.  The kids and I always eat our lunch while watching a movie in the theatre room.  We have never done bowling, rock wall, mini golfing or laser tag but we will some day.  The kids have stuck to the rides- mostly frog hopper, tea cups and mini roller coaster thing as well as the games."}
{"text":"God this place sucks. The manager is a comete as##ole. They sold me and three more people in our group unlimited rides for 7 dollars the problem we are all over 6\"1 and cant fit any of the rides so asked the manager for a refund and he argued with me over it. We couldnt have fit on any of the rides if we wanted to so why charge us then. Stay at peter piper its cheaper and more fun"}
{"text":"Amazing Jakes is GROSS! And, I don't just mean the food, the filth, and the broken games. 

This place is a pedophile's dream! It is used as a babysitting service to countless amounts of teens and preteens (even saw a few unattended kids who couldn't have been over 8) with NO security service provided. The teens who work here are not qualified to handle a serious situation. 

If you have never been to this dive, picture the kiddie area at the state fair put indoors, add a small bowling alley and you have Amazing Jakes. 

As for you grown men who go there to hang out- GROSS! And to the adult couples who go there on a date- WEIRD! 

I saw very few involved parents. Most of the parents who actually were there looked like teenager mothers hanging out with their friends. 

Prepare to pay a minimum of $20 for dinner and games. Long lines for the rides are inevitable (we waited over an hour to drive the race cars.) And 1/3-1/2 of the arcade games are broken. 

Save your $ and don't waste your time. Your kids will have a much better time somewhere else. 

Because of extremely long lines, faulty equipment, and rude unsupervised children, my daughter walked away disappointed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"A great place for the entire family to have fun!  IT is not the best food out there, but it does the job.  More importantly the kids love it and we always have a blast when we go.

We also love all of the different rooms that you can have dinner or a snack in.  We usually end up in the movie room."}
{"text":"Much cleaner than expected, staff very helpful, and no the food isn't gourmet but my kid actually eats it, which says something.  They have three movie screens the kids can watch while eating and a sports room the dads can go hide in."}
{"text":"Horrible!  For the amount we paid, we got here late about 830, paid almost $100.00 for three 8yr olds and two adults. Food was old and they were closing. They got an attitude for complaining about lack of food choices. Gets one star for the games and rides (indoor) could have paid much less at the actual theme park, and yes we will go there so shut your mind mouth! Yes I said that. Place sucks if you're a fan it's because you enjoy bad food with high prices, I'd rather eat Chinese led without buying the toy."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun! We got unlimited rides, buffet and games for three hours. Three hours was just enough. Very friendly staff! The buffet was standard buffet food. Great for kids. Pizza was hot. Tons of salad options plus the Mac was a hit with the little one. Rides are more for little kids except go carts. They are for the bigger ones. Lazer tag was my favorite!  Check prices for adults. I paid for everything for me but only used it for the buffet and Lazer tag.  You really don't need the games or rides unless your kid is too small to ride by themselves. All in all I would recommend this place as a great summer option to beat the heat."}
{"text":"We brought our 9 year old niece here Saturday for a day of fun and excitement. She didn't really get all that excited. The ticket games didn't pay out half the time and when they did, the amount was often inaccurate. I stopped a worker once because the machine said we won but it never spit out any tickets, he said the machines often get stuck and don't pay our the right amount. If you're aware of this FIX IT!
The food was good, the bathrooms are clean but it's a lot of money for a lack luster experience. 
The only thing worth mentioning was a kid named Justin who assisted us in the very long process of my niece trying to decide what she wanted with her tickets, he was patient, kind and offered up tons of suggestions on what she should get and why. He could have been annoyed that she was so indecisive but instead he had fun with it and helped her out. Kudos to Justin!!"}
{"text":"We went over the Christmas break and it was a fun time for a family.
The food was Ok . Pizza and pasta with a decent salad bar.Plenty of ice cream and cookies. Since you can go and grab something anytime you want it breaks up your time there.
If you want to sit down and eat in one of the areas theyplay kids movies.   Around 3 choices of moviestokeep the kids entertained.
They also have a sports and bar area for adults with wi-fi .
It was a fun day ."}
{"text":"The buffet was a bit on the smaller side... the salad options / toppings were great,as far as pizza options not too many different ones to choose from.. mac n cheese was good a bit dry though... also not too many options as far as dessert goes.

I was very disappointed to see that after a certain amount of time once the pizza has been sitting under heat lamps and are dry, they are all just tossed into the trash.... why can't this be donated to a local homeless shelter? Wasting money and food... and there are so many people out there going without food. 

The games were fun a bit pricey, the go karts/bowling/rollercoaster was a big hit."}
{"text":"My kids LOVE this place and the food is pretty good too. I think it has a great variety of food and it was good food, but the only complaint I have is the price. If it was a little less, we would go here alot more. Nice variety though..I would recommend going here."}
{"text":"If you have kids, they are guaranteed to love this place. As an adult, it's headache central. Unsupervised kids running rampant and very loud inside the venue. Buffet food was fresh, but wasn't anything special. The day I went, three of their rides were closed down. They gave us extra playing money on our cards for the inconvenience, but it was still a disappointment. My biggest complaint, however, is the fact that a lot of their arcade games didn't work and it took forever to find someone to help you get you money back on your \"fun card\". It was more trouble than it was worth."}
{"text":"For all you parents out there let me put this in perspective - in AZ there is a heirarchy of indoor \"game\" places that you take your kids as they grow up, as follows: Chuck-E-Cheese, Peter Piper, Amazing Jakes, Dave and Busters, in that order.  The only, and I repeat ONLY one I would go to without the kids is Dave and Busters, so for you reviewers that trashed the place for not being entertaining enough for you, you should have known the second you set foot in the place that it is one step up from Peter Piper.

That said, this place is a good value if you look for the internet specials or coupons.  In addition, there is reasonably priced beer/wine/margaritas for Mom and Dad, and the bowling is a plus if you want to kill time while the kids are wearing themselves out (or you can play it with them, but that sort of defeats the point).

The place is kept quite clean from what I've seen, and the service is friendly if not always on the ball (teenage employees - go figure).  My kids are 6 and 9 and they love this place.  The mini-golf is not super intricate, but it's a pretty good fit for my kids skill level and it goes quicker than the never-ending ones at Fiddlesticks.  The food is a better selection and above what I would expect for this sort of place, and the buffet is quite convenient for the kids.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place for parents with kids (or a group of kids) between 6 and 12."}
{"text":"It has definitely been awhile since I have been here and boy has it changed!

I remember it being packed, people everywhere, all the rides well-kept and fun, the food was relatively good for a buffet, not so much this time. I would say it's been a few years since I have been here, its run down now. Probably comparable to how Jeepers went downhill quickly. 

The eating areas seemed dirty. The food was not good, and I mean I wouldn't think it would really be amazing since it's a game place with a  buffet, but no its pretty bad, not to mention it was all cold. I remember it being fine, not so much now. They really don't have much of a selection either, seems now there is more salad bar than anything else. 

As for the games, they have a decent selection. Most games do seem overpriced. I'm wondering if the price of their games has something to do with the lack of business considering it was a Friday night and practically dead in there. 

The rides are old and in need of an update, and the young employees running them look miserable. 
This place really needs an update to keep it comparable to competitors and to keep customers coming back. 
As for me, I will not be coming back even if invited like I was this time. This place is NO GOOD. 

Save your money and go to Peter Piper, where games are .25-.50 and the pizza is actually good. 
Plus that way you won't have to pay an admission when you don't even want to eat or play in the first place. The only reason I found out the food sucked it because I was forced to pay $12 to enter and figured might as well get something for my money."}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun. My 4 year old had a blast and so did I. I would absolutely come back. But let me be real for a minute. The food is awful. The pizza is just bad. Cardboard crust and not a good selection for a pizza buffet. The pasta I can't vouch for because there were so many unsupervised kids around it, picking at it and stuff, I wasn't about to eat it. The salad bar was just ok. The only things that were good was the cookies and the selection of fountain drinks. The amount of unattended kids near the buffet made me uncomfortable. Kids were filling ice cream cones and then dumping the ice cream out. There was ice cream all over the floor. It was just nasty. And the women's bathroom was easily, the most disgusting bathroom I had been in in some time. FOUL!!

But it was loads of fun and I will definitely go back. I will just eat ahead of time and bring some hand sanitizer next time."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars if they had benches for adults to sit on while kids play. One bench. There is plenty of room for more. The toddler area could be so much better. Come on Amazing Jakes!"}
{"text":"My kids were asked to move to a difference bowling lane, this upset me since I had a group of close to twenty people here celebrating one of my kids birthdays. One of the owners came out spoke to me, I understood the reason he gave, although I didn't agree with his point of view. The fact that he came out heard my complaints was enough to sway me from never coming back here. I say this since he seemed genuine and cared enough to explain his position to me.  

Thanks Jeremy for everything."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would.  Absolutely the worst birthday party experience ever.  They have really gone downhill.  The hot food was warm and the cold food was too!  They had a manager that couldn't make any decisions and employees that were doing doughnuts on the golf carts while we were waiting to ride.  The last straw was when my son was 1/4 of an inch too short to drive the carts and the manager claimed safety reasons wouldn't allow it.  I watched 5 kids before him get let in.  Thank goodness Main Event Entertainment and Fat Cats are nearby because this is the last time this dump gets a dime out of me."}
{"text":"Amazing jake is the perfect place for the family, a dinning area that plays cartoons for the kids and a dining area that plays sports shows for the fathers. Buffet, rides, games, cartoon movies, & sport shows."}
{"text":"The kids had a great time here with all the activities to do. The food was definitely geared toward the customer base. The service was good and they cleaned up after us pretty quickly and did a good job."}
{"text":"Our visit on Aug 24th Started good. Place looked pretty amazing any kids paradise. I knew I was paying a good amount of money for the Birthday reservation. I was ok with that If i was getting my moneys worth. Employees at entrance were very nice. After a while there little things started arising with my guest. There cards not working. An adult in my group who loves to spend money on tickets games won over 2,500 tickets which i was a witness too was having so much fun until he tried to redeem them and they told him he only had 1000? I was so confused because we inserted them together in ticket machine. after several attempts to explain multiple employees denied our claim. Spent over $600 on my guest for food and bowling and games. Plus my guest spent money for there own money for ticket games. disappointed do not recommend Food is very bad. But you know what kids had fun but would just bring for the games and that's all. Don't expect Disneyland Service."}
{"text":"We've taken our kids (4 and 6) here a few times now. The ride and game selections are good for their age group but everything is pretty outdated. The buffet was mediocre but kids will think it's awesome with the pizza and dessert choices. We will probably return but this place has a ton more potential if it was updated a bit! Staff could also use some lessons on how to interact with customers and be friendlier."}
{"text":"It's only getting 1 star because my kiddos still had fun, but I won't be back to this place!!!  There website and radio commercials kept advertising a $14.99 deal of unlimited food, rides and bowling.  We get there, the kids are already excited and the girl checking us in throws out that you have to pay, in addition to the $14.99, an admission charge for each person in your group.  $10.99 per adult and I think it was $6.99 per child.   The food options are pasta, salad and Pizza then cookies and soft serve for desserts.   The food was only passable.  They had a total of 5 rides for my kiddos to ride as even the tallest one wasn't tall enough to drive the go carts, and if I wanted to take them on myself, I had to pay more.  They rode the other 5 rides a few times then we went to the bowling area.   The girl proceeds to tell me that will be $6.98 for the rental on the bowling shoes!!  I was just done!  Be prepared to pay quite a bit more than the advertised \"summer special\" rates!!  Very dissapointed overall."}
{"text":"We went here last minute to celebrate a birthday. Fun was had by all! The staff was wonderful especially the ticket counter exchange. Two young men were running it that Friday night and their customer service was superb!! Great staff!!"}
{"text":"I took my 4 year old daughter there for her birthday and it was the worst experience ever! i will never go here again! we had a issue with the kids who run the rides, so I immediately went to management, a female manager assistant came to what i thought would be to help defuse the situation. which Only made matters far worse, she immediately started cursing in front of my young children and the stand by sheriff. i was so appalled someone in management doesnt know how to talk to customers professionally. Cursing in front of young children is not professional by any means, especially when you work with young children daily. Its absolutely ludicrous to have a manager running a business this way when they cant control their anger in front of customers and especially young children!"}
{"text":"This place is completely overpriced.  The food is below average, and definitely not worth the price.  I don't like that you have to pay for the buffet whether you plan to eat or not.  Would it be that hard to have separate wrist bands to indicate what you have paid for?  Seriously - the kids enjoy the rides, but we usually find alternate places to go because we have no desire to eat the bad food.  Would go more often if you could just pay for rides and attractions..."}
{"text":"A day of fun, laughter & exercise!  What more could you 
ask for?!  Oh yea, lunch too!  Awesome"}
{"text":"I though I was going to hate Amazing Jakes, as I am not a fan of the Peter Pipier Pizza-type places. Mediocre pizza, tons of screaming kids, and paying WAY too much for a little fun. I'd rather go to the park.

BUT, for what it is, Jakes is a cut above the other guys. First of all, I was surprised by the decor/ambiance. Definitely more classy and adult-oriented than I expected. 

Second, the place is HUGE. No matter how full the parking lot looks, the cavernous place absorbs the masses, and individual dining rooms and attractions are hardly ever full.

Then there are the rides and games. Pretty much everything you could ask for. Bowling, a rock wall, laser tag, video games, etc...  As was said before, the food is nothing great, but better than I expected. 

We hosted out high school's grad party here and was VERY pleased with the outcome. The management and staff were great. If you don't mind plunking down the $$$ for the food and amusements, go for it. Like me, you might be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Description:
I wanted to share with you my recent experience at this birthday party factory. It's sort of a Peter Piper Pizza on 'Roids, complete with Laser Tag, Bumper Cars, and a Bowling Alley. combined with a Salad/Pizza buffet. There is also a bar serving beer, wine and 'Rita's (it may possibly be full service)

While Amazing Jake's caters to group events like birthday parties, anyone can walk in an plop down a hunk of cash to eat, drink and play. There are multiple themed rooms where you can enjoy  your meal. Some of the rooms included a movie room, showing kids movies, two rooms with sports themes, and a few others. Buffet prices are about what you'd pay anywhere, $7.99 per adult for unlimited buffet, $3.99 or $4.99 for the little kids. The birthday party price is $9.95 per kid and includes unlimited soft drinks, the buffet, 10 tokens per guest, a room and a server.

Of course, don't put your wallet away quite yet. Every attraction has an individual price, or you can purchase unlimited use wristbands, the pricing for that (I think) is $5.95 for the little kids attractions and $10.95 for most everything (bowling is extra). The a la carte prices are pretty steep in comparison (e.g. $5.25 for a single Go cart ride), so I'd recommend the wristband.

One very important thing to know about your Amazing Jake's birthday party is that while parents are allowed in to drop and pick up their children, if they stay the length of the party you will be charged a buffet for each parent. Some of the attending parents knew this, others didn't. I would suggest that if this s important to you that you somehow make sure the parents know the deal..

Review:
The reservation process went smoothly, we made our reservations on site (I think you can also do so on-line and by phone) and were handed a set of invitations, with the instruction to arrive 15 minutes early. We chose to have our party at 10AM, a little early, but we had other things going on that day. We arrived at 9:40 and the doors were locked. After a few minutes we were allowed in and asked to wait. We then spent the next 15 minutes waiting at the entrance lobby while our room was prepared. I do not understand why they could not have been a little more organized for the first group of the day. None the less, we were shown in to our room that was nicely decorated. We had been warned that we might end up sharing our room, and in fact we did end up doing so. My wife asked if we could have the location where we could see most of the arcade area, and we were informed that we could not. Off to a bad start.

You are invited to stay at Jake's all day, but for your birthday party, you only have the reserved room for 90 minutes. We chose to allow the kids to play for 45 minutes and then site them down for pizza, cake and gifts. This strategy worked well enough, except that locating the 10 kids in this warehouse was a bit of a chore, and the kids in laser tags would be in there about 10 minutes at a time. I managed to have the kids located in about 10 minutes, leaving us only 35 minutes left to eat and scoot.

OK, the food: 
- They offer three soups, I enjoyed the roasted Tomato and the Thai Chicken. Both were very good
- They offer three or four pasta dishes, I had a little bit of Cajun Penne that was nicely spicy
- The salad bar was complete and fresh
- I had one slice of pizza which I thought was unremarkable. The sauce was bland, as was the pepperoni. I would give them good marks for the variety of pizza's they offered.
- There was a wide selection of desserts, which I managed to avoid

I keep thinking about Sweet Tomatoes as I review the offerings here, it is quite similar.

All went well, our server was quite helpful, bringing in pizza and pitchers of drinks for the kids, lighting the cake, cutting and handing out the cake. and of course, picking up our mess :) Midway through our visit, she approached us, apologized for the early confusion, and gave us a bag of 200 tokens for our trouble. Ahh, now we are feeling better...

But wait, the boys are telling us that they were not allowed on the bumper cars because they had the wrong wristband! We paid the $10.95 fee, what was the deal? My wife spoke to the bumper car operator, who gave the predictable \"Uh, it wasn't me\" response. My wife complained about this to one of the managers, who gave us a credit for $95! Holy cow!

Conclusions:
Our cost, after a couple of extra adults, 7 big kids and two smaller kids came to about $225. Adding the tip for the hostess it came to about $25/person. That's not dirt cheap, but compared to other parties we've had, it is pretty competitive with renting a bounce and doing it at your house. 

I could really see getting together with another dad or two and taking the kids there in the evening, enjoying a beer or two in one of the sports rooms while they kids run around. I'm guessing that's where my $95 credit is going to go."}
{"text":"We go here when we are simply just hungry and go for the all you can eat buffet! They play movies which are watchable in the big screen sections. When we go for fun the indoor rollercoaster, bumper cars, bowling and laser tag always keeps us entertained!"}
{"text":"The true value of this place is escape from the 111 degree heat. Yelp indicates my review is shorter than most. But that's all I have to say. \"How to blow $50 in an hour\""}
{"text":"The manager Jeremy should lose his job and work somewhere that has little involvement with children. He does not understand the concerns that most parents have or know how to properly treat his guests.

{"text":"The food has gone down hill since they first opened, or my taste for decent food has gone up. I remember this play being at least edible and presentable looking, however today it was not. They are lucky they are in AZ and have blasting air conditioning and entertainment for the kids, otherwise they would have been out of business a long time ago based on their food."}
{"text":"After several visits I am now thoroughly convinced that their race car ride is a trap to run out your two hour  card. It goes around like 30 times making the wait forever. it would make more sense to only go around 10 times so the turnover for the line would be much faster. There's literally no point in  riding it again.

It makes no sense to have half your visit spent waiting in line and then the other half spent in the actual ride doing the same thing over and over again for eternity.

This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"great spot if you are sick of the normal peter piper pizza/Chucky cheese... food was okay. it was very crowded but it was a Saturday so I'm sure there were parties. wish it wasn't that far and a little more cleaner."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you'd expect . . . lots of kids, lots of noise and an alright buffet. We went on a Tuesday when they offer a one-time price of $18.99 per person but this includes the buffet and EVERYTHING in the place except for games that give out tickets or prices. It's a \"for real\" all day price too, not just the three hours. We got there at about noon and didn't leave until almost 9:00 PM. 
For that price we did the laser tag (a few times), bumper cars (a few times), miniature golf, cosmic bowling, go-carts, video games, air hockey, lunch, dinner, dessert and the kids got on the rides like 75 million times. We paid $82 for our family of four which I think for all we got is a great deal anywhere. 
Now, the buffet is not gourmet by any standards, but it's OK. There were several kinds of pizza and pastas, a couple of soups, a baked potato station, a salad bar, the standard soda fountain and several desserts. They also have different themed dining rooms, so we had lunch in the movie room, dessert in the club house and dinner in the sports room. 
I suppose they also sell beer and wine. I didn't try any, but just be warned that if you're that dad that's trying to beat your tween at air hockey while playing with one hand and holding a glass of red wine in the other, you look like a giant DB. 
Again, yes the place is loud, yes there are A LOT of kids, but they all seem to be having a blast, at least mine did. To see them have as much fun as they did, I'd gladly tolerate all that noise!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, the rides are good, its a fun place for kids probably more fun for 5 years old and up. Uounger kids can enjoy it too but the rides are more for a little older. My son is 3 and loves it but can really enjoy itbto the fullest"}
{"text":"I came here for my best friends nieces birthday party. All I knew about this place was that is was an amusement park. In my mind I'm thinking of a small little kiddy zone. I was wrong! 

This indoor amusement park was HUGE! I was blown away by the many rides and games! The unlimited buffet was even good! Their pasta was good for being 'unlimited' and usually buffets never meet my expectations. They also had pizza and salads and of course dessert and a soda machine. 

There is a bar also for alcoholic beverages for adults and a sports bar. There is a movie room for kids. 

The rides were unlimited and I even went on some of the rides with the kids and so did some of the parents. They have a mini roller coaster that is actually really fast and enjoyable to older teens and adults as well which is nice. Their laser tag arena is cool, too! 

This is a cool place to host a birthday party!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off worst place to come to food taste like crap and the games were a rip off don't come here"}
{"text":"Nothing about this place really stood out for me, for better or for worse. The games were in mostly good condition from what I tried, and it was at a decent value compared to many modern arcades. However the pizza buffet was mediocre, redemption and simulation games made up most of the arcade, and prizes were a little overpriced. Overall, if you ever went to Johns Incredible Pizza, you basically came here too without even knowing it. At the price it's at, the place is not bad, but it is far from the best I've seen"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for a friend's son's birthday.  The packages for food and fun are pretty reasonable (to my childless standards, anyway).  I really like that you get a room for 90 minutes with your group; this makes for a more adult-friendly experience.  It's hard to imagine a group of parents standing around the arcade trying to chat while the place is overrun with kiddos going crazy for games!

The buffet was a welcome surprise; I really didn't think that the food would be as good as it was, or have as much variety.  The baked potato bar was my fave!

Since I don't have kiddos of my own, I doubt I'll return, but for the party scene, it's pretty great."}
{"text":"$49 for summer VIP pass ! Totally worth every penny if you love near by.  Smart for business too because w. 10% off ill bring my kids friends w me too :).    49 for 3 hours unlimited rides , lazier tag, rock climb, video games and bowling plus food.   You can come as many time as you want till 8/31!  I'm here daily for snack, lunch , dinner and just for fun :)

Okay so 49$ summer pass is so amazing had to talk about it but now to this place ...

They have improved so much since last year! Staff is always cleaning , helpful and  most of the games work! 

That being said,  here are break down:

FOOD:  can't expect 5 star food At a kid joint, as parent we all hope for it but doesn't seem to work. So stop hoping! Lol. However their quality isn't so bad, I think by cutting protein costs ( no meat here sorry) their vegs. R quit fresh and 6 different dressings to choose from .  It's nothing special but considering u can make lunch special urself ( I like veg soup w jalapeños , and salad full of protein veg) and my kid will eat his salad! Due to negotiation :)

GAME: not huge selections but has enough for adults to enjoy but wait time sucks :( but u always have to wait at place like this anyways. I like their transformer shooting game :).    Ticket games are kind of pricey at being $1 but it did spit out 1000 ticket for my lil 5 yr old how ever prizes r too over priced!

RIDES: something is always down but that's expected w small place like this they r high maintainece .  But they don't hVe much anyways and lines really long but my 5 yr old seem to be happy so who's to be the judge? 

I did see an employee explain in the beganing to someone before they get in which rides r down so u won't be totally disappointed lol nice touch 

Over all you can spend whole day here,I suggest to get full money , enter , eat lunch ( card won't start time till u swipe it ) and than go play, than take snack time at the movie area ,  I can see 49$ deal is amazing and other family is taking full advantage of it too!   I saw this kid who probably come here all summer that was drinking hot chocolate over ice to make it into choco milk, mmmm I have to try that lol"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my nephews birthdays with the family. They have various party packages that come with food, a party room and lots of fun activities. Laser tag was super fun and for $5 we upgraded to unlimited bowling. However, and that is why they didn't earn 5 stars, the bowling place is due for upgrades. The screens didn't work properly on all of the lanes and points weren't given accurately. But I guess I shouldn't complain for 5 bucks!? All in all a very fun place for kids and adults to spend the day."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for kids! Had my son's 6th birthday party here and it was great! We didn't rent one of their rooms and they still allowed us to bring in our cake. Lots of stuff to do packed in one convenient place! Foods not fantastic but good enough!"}
{"text":"I was not amazed. Nope. Sometimes it's fun to act like a kid again. I love Dave and Buster's, but we were in the mood for go karts and it was too hot outside for Fiddlestix. I saw a deal online and should've realized then it was too good to be true.

We got 3 hours, some video game credits, and a meal for about $20 each. When I was reading the description online, I was picturing this: large pizza and salad buffet (ok, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this), indoor go karts, bowling, 18-hole mini golf course, rock climbing wall, indoor roller coaster.. I was sorely disappointed.

As soon as we walked in the door, I noticed everything seemed cheap. A lot of the paint here is sloppy, and in areas the floor is messed up. The furnishings are well worn. It looked like there used to be a large grocery/big box store here that was repurposed.  I'd already paid for our tickets online, so we proceeded.

First, we ate the buffet. There were grubby grubby children all over- I have no problem with kids (or I wouldn't have come here in the first place) but there was no supervision whatsoever at the buffet, and some children don't know enough manners to be by themselves. I stayed away from a few of the items for this reason- not enough tongs and too many dirty hands touching noses and foodses!

The \"salad bar\" was pathetic. Plain iceberg lettuce and not much to go with it. The pizza wasn't much either, very bland but I can see kids liking it. The pasta was the same, along with being overcooked. For dessert I had an ice cream cone and a rice krispie treat...those are hard to get wrong. We each got a beer- it took about 10 minutes just to flag someone at the liquor counter down. Eager to go be \"amazed\", we quickly drank the beers in a faux garden and then made our way onward. 

We went to the other side of the building to start our \"fun\". To let our food digest, we decided to go for the mini golf first. Probably 75% of the holes are just simple variations on straight lines and zigzags. The landscaping is pathetic..I think maybe it was supposed to be beach-themed? I felt like I could build something better in my backyard. Again, it was totally unsupervised so kids were running from hole to hole, going in the wrong order, and getting in the way. 

Next, we tried the \"indoor roller coaster\". If you've ever been to a fair, it's a Himalaya. It's a very old, rickety, bumpy Himalaya. I had bruises on my legs after riding this. I was somewhat worried it would fall apart while we were on it.

By now, we were getting a little low on time and decided to go over to the go karts. There was a long, long line that seemed to move so slowly. They only had 4 karts, and only ran 2 at a time while the next 2 people sat waiting. We soon saw why- this go kart track is just a small oval. We decided to make the best of it, and anxiously waited our turns. At long last, we were racing! Well, that was until they decided my fiance was driving too fast and *electronically slowed his car*. That pretty much took all of the fun out of it. 

After that, we used the credits on our cards- the games were not a great value so they were all gone within about 10 minutes. I didn't even win enough tickets to get good junk candy, so I ended up giving my card to a coworker for his kids. 

Initially, we had thought about bowling after our time expired (you have to pay extra). However, by the time we'd been through the whole experience, we wanted to get out of this dump and back home. Amazing Jake's may be good for kids who don't know any better, but it's not a good place to try and have fun if you're just adults who wish they were kids."}
{"text":"This place is great for families with kids aged 5-17. You can just come here and let them loose to play and have unlimited access to all the food and ice cream they want. There is a bar for the adults to hang out while the kids play. 
We brought our two year old son and he was a little overwhelmed with everything going on and didn't really have a great time from what I could see. There was some cute little rides for little kids but I would suggest no younger then two. My son preferred the little foam block area compared to anything else. The food was nothing special, the pizza and salad was alright, maybe like a 4 out of 10 for the food. 
The prizes for the games are pretty lame. 
The price for things was a little high, but I could see this place being fun on a hot summer day. They only had 5 go karts and 5 bumper carts so the wait was longer then normal.
I like that you can self serve drinks and food but that also causes the issue of everything being a total disaster. Having tons of kids get their own ice and drinks and ice cream calls for a HUGE mess! The little movie area where you can sit and eat was a great idea, you can choose from 3 different movies. The tables were all a mess and it can be hard to find a seat but overall a great idea.
The price per game is high for what you actually get. Just be prepared to spend a decent amount and have stuff be a little messy due to self service. 
I would come back but not till my son is older."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars for the buffet , and the overall cleanliness of the place .The food looked amazing ! There were a ton of different items to choose from , and the entire food area was very well organized . We were here for a birthday party for the 1st time , and hopefully for the last ! Man oh man.. first off the birthday parents were charged $10 per adults (none of the adults ate anything, played any games or rode any rides !) 2nd of all the while birthday set up is ridiculous. You get 1.5 hours in a long hallway labeled private party.. ok.. once you are in your birthday hallway you are supposed to coral all your guest there to eat pizza, drink punch, open gifts , eat cake , and then go play?!? Seriously .. none of the kids wanted to eat anything they wanted to play.. so by the time the 1.5 hours was up and the kids could actually go and play it was time for their parents to pick them up! Fantastic.. my son felt like he waited around an hour and a half to play , and then didn't get to do anything since we were told the party was from 1-2:30 pm .what a disappointment and a huge expense for the birthday family.. sorry but this place is way over priced and the birthday technique is backwards."}
{"text":"Birthday Party Guest Alert!  

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  If your child is a guest at a birthday party, expect to pay an ENTRY FEE.  Yes, that's right, an entry fee to be able watch after your 5YO."}
{"text":"Jake maybe amazing but this place isn't. Large upfront cost and low \"free play\" availability. Extra cost everywhere. Wouldn't come again. Oh and the food is average at best."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We were a party of 4 adults, and  8 year old, 4 year old, and 3 year old.

I feel this place is overpriced for what facility offers.
30 min wait lines for Go Karts til school groups left.
Food on the buffet was luke warm to cold.  Although tasty.
Bowling automatic scorers were not keeping accurate totals.  Marking spares when spares weren't made.
The coaster ride was inoperable.
Most rides had no attendants. Had to continuously look for attendants. 

It was a unique experience and the kids did have a good time."}
{"text":"New owners, recently remodeled (to be complete early December) and better food! Everyone said the pizza was great and the salad bar was surprisingly large with healthy and delicious options. The place looks cleaner and updated. We just hosted my sons birthday party and Vera was so friendly and helpful. The whole thing was a breeze. The party manager also stopped in to wish him a happy bday and to make sure everything was fun and up to standard (it was!)"}
{"text":"Amazing jakes has so many bad reviews but I actually thought it was pretty fun.Being inside a building with great ventilation on a hot (105+ degrees) summer day in AZ was quiet refreshing...  I went last Sunday and my first impression of the building was \"Woah! this is huge!\" They had a special for 7$ unlimited buffet. We got the unlimited buffet and the unlimited rides and the bowling  card. the card was around $14 plus the buffet= $21 per person. 

We were starving so the first place we headed was to the buffet. The appearance of the buffet was beyond me. Everything looked so delicious but sometimes appearances may fool you. I literately tried every single item on that buffet and nothing was extraordinary,but yesii t was eatable unless you have strong taste buds then eat before you get there. I am not a picky eater and i will try anything once and so I did. 

Soon after, we headed to the bowling alley... There was no wait because we were with a party of 6 that was already there...The lanes are so old that once you roll the ball it can not seem to ever go straight. but not a problem i still had lots of fun and kept everyone anxious and competitive and wining, which kept me laughing. 

The arcade games.. With the card you get to play most of them expect the ones that give you tickets(you have to insert money into you card for to play those machines). I played almost every arcade game expect the ones that were additional $$.I cant say much about the rides since i only used the bumper cars like 3 times! i had so much fun bumping into everyone and their mommas. 

Now the laser tag.. Was very fun, now i get excited for everything because i don't have any expectations on new things. It was my first experience and I loved it. We were the last group so we took over the whole floor.

This is definitely not a 5 star arcade/buffet/amusement park. but it sure is fun and is something to experience with your loved ones. I do think that the good outweighed the bad and I made so many memories in a span of 3.5 hours. keep in mind that i was there only 3.5 hours and i did all that so technically speaking is not so big but is so much fun."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you get in return.  A fun place to take the kids, lot's of good activities, ie. bumper cars, mini golf, video games, go carts..  Everything else is typical Chuck E Cheese....overpriced tokens, skee ball, video games, and cheap trinkets.  Overall, it is a fun place to go..."}
{"text":"Have to agree with some of the reviews here. You should only go here if you want to lose a lot of weight quickly from vomiting and the other end all night long. Dirty dirty dirty. Everything is dirty and nasty and on top of it all they charge you way to much. Chuckie cheese is a cleaner place then this and I would not want my dog eating off the floor of this place.  I am sorry to be so harsh, but this is the sad reality of this place.  If you own the place and are reading this, fix it up a little - do a better job and more people would probably come.  Think about quality and your kids eating and playing there."}
{"text":"Arrived for a birthday party and *beware* if you stay with your kid,  you have to pay for an adult entry. Also food was BAD.  Games cost way too much. (2.00 for one game of air hocky!!!)  So crowded you can barely move.  Also WTF  with the reserved seating in the dining room?   Apparently they will reserve empty tables ALL day so no one else can sit to eat. So if you go for the crappy food , good luck trying to find a place to sit and eat it!!!"}
{"text":"Long lines, broken rides, the value isn't there for the time bought. You have to pay additional fees for all seevices. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Over priced.  Spent close to 500 for a kids birthday party and the room was awfully hot.  We were all sweating waiting on the host to hurry things along.  Finally after a half hour, the pizzas came.  The food is terrible and I had to nag the host to bring out the birthday cake.  The place was understaffed too and the bowling alley was a joke.  Lousy service. Lousy all around."}
{"text":"Place to me is a bit pricey, but it's not really too bad if you're willing to pay the price.  My son came here on his 5th grade graduation with his classmates and they loved it.  They have a nice food buffet and areas completely separate from the gaming stuff so it can be quieter for you to eat or hang out at.  They have TV screens and free WiFi, though, I think they need a stronger signal for their WiFi.

And, I wished they had areas where you could plug in your laptop or devices, like a bunch of areas, but I couldn't even find one, so that is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I liked their buffet in that it had good salad.  The pizza was okay.  They had a good selection of desserts, pasta stuff and other things that I didn't eat.  So, you can play to your heart's content and eat.

They also have bowling and laser tag, but I think the bowling was a separate price.  My son had a great time, as his friends, and I got to spend a quiet time in the remote dining area quietly by myself with my laptop."}
{"text":"Horrible staff .. horrible experience .. one guest charged for birthday party the rest in for free.."}
{"text":"Fun venue for kids and parents. Lots of food and game/ride options"}
{"text":"We had a table for 1 hour and a half, how do they expect for everyone to eat and open presents, cit the cake, and show up in 1 hour? It's a childrens place, its hard for them to get settled down. We never even seen our hostess until the end when it was time to collecr miney. They are very disorganized and way over priced for just the 1 hour and a half! I wouldnt recommend having a party there however, the games and attractions look fun."}
{"text":"LONG REVIEW...cause' parents don't have money to waste!
Little kids like a lot of space to run around (running is prohibited) and everything is bigger to little ones, so Amazing Jake's probably seems like a planet to them.  
The website does a good job at listing and describing all the attractions and restrictions.  
They offer online coupons if you sign up for an email thingy, and it doesn't annoy you more than once a month.  We used a $12.99 3-hour deal which included everything except bowling and video games.  You have to put money on cards to play the arcade machines, which we didn't do, so I can't comment on the quality, up-to-dateness or reliability of any of the games, but I can say that there are plenty of them.  I also can't say how much the machines cost.  For $5 more, you get bowling and video games all day; nice for Saturday or if you got the day off and the kids are out of school.  Buffet was included.
We brought kids ranging from 16 down to 7...and there was a 10 year old girl, too.  We went on a Wednesday night the place; was so empty there was hardly a wait for anything.  *hint hint, parents with short fuses, this is good for you*
The rock climbing wall is about 25 feet and looks like all the hand and foot holds are in tact.  The workers rotated often - some were attentive others weren't.
The mini-coaster is just a round track with a bunch of carts on it and a couple stuffed Batmans sitting in the middle looking sick and woozy.  They made me giggle, then wish that more effort was put into presentation.  This ride went pretty darn fast for the 10 and 7 year old, and they got a kick out of it.  A teen wouldn't get too much of a thrill unless they are a wuss.  Adults would fit in the cars just fine, but would probably fall asleep.  Good for the younger kids.
Laser tag made me smile.  It was such a humble attempt, but at least they tried.  The arena is small, but remember its for kids, and they will probably find the size just fine.  The 'walls' are just screens with little holes to snipe through.  The bases are lights that you can stand and tag all day long.  My main issue is the vests and guns...but, I guess I will drop my haughty Laser Tagophileness and remember that this is FOR THE KIDS.  I didn't get to see the reaction of the teens, but the younger ones had FUN.  Our littlest is a small guy and he was able to handle the gun just fine.
The bumper cars only had 4 operable with one poor piece of junk sitting in the corner.  The arena is small, even for little kids.  The cars provide the right amount of BUMP for adults and won't jar smaller kids' brains loose.  The important thing is that every kid that was in here was smiling and laughing the whole time, so that's all you need to know.
I didn't ride the go-karts, and both the 10 and 7 year old were too short, so I can't comment on the quality of the karts or track. The teens were unimpressed, BUT, keep in mind that we've been going to one of those REAL go-kart places lately where the karts go like...fast, so yeah.  If your kid is tall enough (58 inches) they will enjoy it...I mean it IS go-karts, after all.  If they are too short, they can ride with someone or just look longingly from the sideline.  Awww.
Amazing Jake's bowling wasn't good.  The shoes aren't fit to give to the homeless.  The balls have more gnashes and bumps in them than Mickey Rourke and Ray Liotta's faces combined (sorry, dudes).  The lanes are unevenly waxed.  The score-keepers end your game early.  There is a serious lack of available weights and sizes of bowling balls for smaller bowlers.  One good thing was that the staff (when there WAS staff even there) made wrong things right and were decently pleasant about it.  Not worth the price, though.  I'm sorry.  Find a local bowling alley, try to get coupons for it, and go there instead.  
We didn't do the other attractions.  
The buffet?  About 6 kinds of pizza, a nice selection of salad stuff, two soups, breads, your usual pasta suspects, very few dessert options, and a large variety of fountain drinks.  The pasta was quite tasty believe it or not.  The pizza will suit kids.  The salad was fresh.  Its 10 bucks for adults and 7 something for kids 10 & under.  You'll use the toilet, no doubt...
Bathrooms were clean...but it wasn't busy so not a lot of dumps were taken.
Staff was sparse due to what night it was, and they ranged from very friendly and helpful to lethargic.  I did like how hard the buffet staff worked to keep things clean and refreshed.  And like I mentioned, the bowling staff fixed our problems and were patient with all the kids.
The regular prices are too high, but its because they have the added attractions and the buffet - $22.  Sign up for the coupons or go somewhere else, unless that's not expensive for you.  They have other packages that are in the more affordable range like $13
Will your kids have fun?  Yes, if they are under 13.  Will you have fun?  Yes, if you like to see your kids have fun."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. My wife called to validate that we would be able to use trade scrip at the facility and the employee said we absolutely would be able to. She packs up all the kids and their friends and heads over there. When they arrive she is told a completely different story. There's a line of people waiting to get in so they mutually agree that she will pay and discuss later. Called later to resolve and the employee on the phone was rather rude when asking for a manger. Questioning as to why. Why? Because i want to speak with a manager. Spoke with the manager and was rather unfriendly to and somewhat uncompromising. Said he would try and resolve with the company with the scrip and would call me call later that day. Both proved to be untrue. Never gave me a courtesy call back. He told me he would try and resolve, told the scrip company no way would he resolve. That's just deceptive in my book. Say one thing to the customer and then do the opposite. Will never go back - no time for people like that.

Wife said food was bad, outdated, cold and stale. Servers were loud and several times dropping plates, loudly dropping bev racks which she said was disturbing. She said overall it was a very bad experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Everything  about this place is sub-par really. My son waited an hour to go on the go karts, not worth it. Food was gross. If I hadn't purchased groupons I would have been so mad at the waste of money."}
{"text":"Fun place, but it has gotten quite pricey & the food is just mediocre. I do like the different dining options though. My kids love the theater room. We went yesterday & it was crazy busy! Not my favorite. But my kids LOVE it. (Groupon has a great deal right now). With 5 kids I can't afford it without a deal."}
{"text":"It was a lot of fun playing video games, bowling, mini golf, going on the rollercoaster, and laser tag.  Laser tag was super fun.  This little boy was following me the whole time, then I would turn around and he run really fast away so I couldn't shoot him.  LOL  That was so funny.  I was with my hubby and we had a blast together.

Their buffet was okay.  I did not like their salad.  It tasted kinda dirty.  But their pizza, pasta, and cinnamon bread sticks were really good and fresh.  They have four different seating areas including a patio area and bar.

I would recommend bringing your family here for a day to play.  Do stick together because you could get lost in this place. 

Good memories and fun times.  We really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"really 20 minutes plus to get on go kart driver . need more organization or something . pizza ugh .i did have a good chocolate chip cookie . salad bar ok spud bar yuck . pepesi products only ."}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for.  We had a groupon and used additional promo codes for a deeper discount on our Amazing Jake's experience.  I'd describe the place as Slightly Above Average Jake's.  The pizza was like cardboard and bland.  The Mac and cheese tasted like glue.  The penne with marinara was decent.  the spaghetti had practically no sauce on it so we didn't even bother.  The soups (chicken noodle amd broccoli cheese) were actually pretty good though and the salad bar was stocked with plenty of options.  We particularly enjoyed the chocolate ice cream.  The kid's enjoyed the attractions and we played a round of bowling.  We drive in from Prescott to go here and probably wouldn't go out of our way again, but if we were in the area maybe we'd go again."}
{"text":"Well...what does one say about Amazing Jake's? It is what you would expect...chaos in a box! If you are looking for sensory overload, then this is your place! There is a lot to do here - rides, games, bowling, bumper cars, a buffet and more. The team working is relatively friendly - not overly so unfortunately - and really don't add to the experience in any positive way.  Many of the video games needed attention, which was disappointing.  Those two things along with the buffet line needing some attention in terms of cleanliness bring my star rating down a couple of notches."}
{"text":"Food is gross but the activities available for the kiddos is good. I am disappointed that you can't just come and pay for the activities. You are charged an admission fee which includes the food but the food is nothing to rave about!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Poor customer service.  The place is dirty.  Several of the games are out of order.  Too expensive.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"I took my kids for the first time here and it was soooo much fun!  I was a little jaded from other reviews but I was happily surprised to see its much better than I expected.  Paying $7-10 for an all you can eat buffet buffet is not unreasonable at all, they have options like pizza, pasta, baked potatoes, soup, even sweet corn chips and fruit for dessert for those with gluten or dairy intolerance that cannot have the cookies or ice cream. There are several options for beverages from hot tea and coffee to soft drinks and you can buy cocktails and beer if that's what you're into.  They have several areas for seating and different themes throughout, like the \"movie\" sitting area, sports lounge or the \"outside\" seating.  The wifi and lack of accessible electric outlets are the reasons I give them 4 instead of 5 stars, it's nice to let the kids roam while you get some work done but there has to be some improvement on the wifi signal and it would be nice if there was additional seating area towards the back where the rides are located.  The staff was super friendly, I was impressed with how friendly and caring they all were.  Kids had so much fun and so did I.  I would highly recommend this place as an option to those trying to keep kids busy during these hot days.  You can easily spend 5 hours there, between play and eating.  Will definitely go back.  Forgot to mention, they have a height requirement for the go cars drivers, you have to be tall enough to reach the pedals, which means most kids under 10-12 might need a designated driver.  You can always go with them (must be paying adult) or have them go with some other tall kids already going.  Just keep in mind they are strict about this rule and it is absolutely necessary for them to be so since they wouldn't reach the pedals or even be mature enough to drive."}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option this place would get zero stars. Went her for my nephews birthday and it was horrible. We all left early. The food was bad, if pizza is the main dish you serve it should at least be edible. Lots of hidden fees. The cards for unlimited play for KIDS only for the adult shooting games and racing games and not the smaller games with tickets. This place is for kids and doesn't have many kid games. Spend your money by going to David and Busters or main event"}
{"text":"We had a family fun day this last weekend at Amazing Jake's. We had a really great time and the kids had a blast too. The food was really good and there was a wide variety of options. Baked potato bar, salad bar, soup, pizza, cookies, and rice crispy treats. Unfortunately they only had soda and lemonade as beverage options, with this being a kids place I thought maybe they would have apple juice or grape juice. 

The other thing we were confused about was where to sit. We wanted to sit and  eat where we could see the kids and keep an eye on them but the seating area was around the corner. I wish it was set up like peter piper pizza where it's open and you can keep an eye on your kids while you chow down. There was no place to set our stuff and hang out so we us to carry everything with us, next time we will bring a stroller. 

We went rite when they opened so we didn't have to sit and wait for rides too long. My daughter isn't 4 yet so she couldn't ride the \"frog hop\" yet which was a bummer but she could ride everything else. All in all we had a great time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had my nieces 12th birthday here last weekend and it was a blast! It was last a minute decision but I was not disappointed. 
They have two entrances one for the general public for some family fun and the other entrance You walk into the party side of the building and its all reservations or for big groups. 

We got wrist bands that included all day rides including laser tag and all you can eat buffet. The buffet is not bad at all for being a kids indoor amusement park. You have a pasta station, soup and salad station, a pizza station, ice cream and desserts. The rides are very well organized and the wait for the rides is only couple minutes when its busy. 

You also get a $5 game card to use in the arcade room which is pretty awesome and can be used through out the day. The arcade room is kinda pricey though when it comes to picking a game to play. 

I recommend Amazing jakes it kinda blew my mind and reminded me of Disneyland with all the different rooms. They had the \"movie room\" which plays Disney movies that you can watch while eating. They had the sports room with TVS with sports and a bar and a couple of other rooms. 
For the price and with everything that it includes, its not bad at all."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for my nephew's birthday. So we got one of those private rooms where you have one person who helps take care of you by getting you drinks, cleaning of dishes, and cleaning the room. Very nice. The rooms have lots of table space and very quiet. 

The games and rides are really amazing. They have go-carts, bumper cars, tea cups, coaster ride, bowling allies, rock climbing, and laser tag. Plus lots of video games, air hockey. So there is a lot to keeps the kids busy and entertained. 

Only problem is the food. This is probably the worst food I've ever had. It has a buffet with a desert bar, pasta bar, salad bar, and a pizza bar. Pasta bar had different kinds of pasta but really bad. No taste. The pizza bar had all sorts of different pizzas. I had some buffalo wings pizza. Crust was like cardboard. Other pizza had a softer crust but wasn't very good. No taste. All I can say is that you can't mess up a salad bar. So that was okay. Not great. Oh yea they had soup bar too. I had some potato soup and it had no taste. Overall, the food was terrible. I would recommend that you eat before or after but don't eat there. 

So the rides and games are great. Food is bad and the service was great. They really keep the place clean. So have fun but eat somewhere else and it will make your overall experience even better."}
{"text":"Thank you for a great time. Keep doing an amazing job.  Special thanks to Frankie for a phenomenal job with my kiddos. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing Jakes is truly amazing! (yes I know cheesy) but seriously it is so much fun. Let me start off by saying how big this place is there's so much room and it does get crowded so I suggest coming early my family including myself loved it so much that we were there on a Sunday from 11am-6pm. First thing you notice is the food they have spaghetti (pastas), all sorts of pizzas, a baked potato station, salad bar, ice cream, cookies, and for the adults margaritas, beer, and wine. I wish they would carry any type of meat sadly they don't :( the food I would rate it 3 stars they can do a lot better in taste mainly the pastas. The games and rides I would give 5 stars. They have bowling, go karts, laser tag and couple more rides. Also those addicting arcade games that you can't stop playing because you need more tickets for prizes. Now going into employees I would say they are understaffed a lady in a black employee shirt different from the rest blue shirts was rude there's no need for names I know there was a lot of us mommies asking for help/questions so I was understanding and sympathetic."}
{"text":"First timer here. It wasn't crowded since its Monday. That's a plus for is. We got the 3 hope unlimited ride pass for our daughter, however only the teacups and carousel worked. They said the trains was getting fixed mow however no one was working on it The whole time we were here. My daughter enjoyed the teacup ride but the carousel was way too shaky and unstable I thought it was going to break down.  The games are all super expensive even the small kiddie games. Overall all it was ok for my almost two year old to fun around and burn energy. The reviews were right about it being dirty. The front desk clerk was the nicest person. Everyone else seemed irritated."}
{"text":"An ok spot..some pros and cons.  

Pros: Bowling.  Love the setup with screens.  If you get the family pass, this is included for free.  Dining with movies is another plus.  Kids loved eating while watching some of their favorite movies, it's like being at the theater.

Cons:  That's about it.  The arcades are dated, and rest of attractions are very compact.  Especially the go karts and bumper cars...very small tracks.  
The buffet is really just pizza, salad, and cookies.  Not much else that was appealing.

This place was advertised as a top attraction when visting Mesa, I would pass.  It's not in best location.  
If you're in the area and looking for a place to go bowling with games, then I'll say it's worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I went in in August and had the worst experience! My son who LOVES pizza took 3 bites and was done because the pizza was cold and disgusting. We tried 3 pizzas and the potato bar between the 3 of us and it was all cold and gross. We left feeling nauseous! The game area was fun but a little dirty. After we left I was frustrated with our wasted money on gross food we didn't even eat and emailed the manager. She was very nice and apologetic and offered me a $30 gift card to come back and give them another chance... its been nearly 2 months and I haven't received the gift card. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Omg this place is soooo fun and they had good food now all i need is some bat man underwear and ill be a kid again lol"}
{"text":"Simple request that annoys a lot of customers!!! Please fix your free photo kiosk....really disappointing we never got our photo sent to us!!!!!! I was looking forward to that priceless photo........"}
{"text":"The kiddo had a blast.  Hell, I had a blast! Sometimes it's the small things in life :) Sundays are cheap if you ask for the $7 admin and $7 upgrade.  Works out to $14 per person without the arcade. We go a la carte on that as we keep the 4 yo busy with the rides!  The other patrons can sometimes be a bear...it's a huge place."}
{"text":"First of all its a buffet. Not a Vegas buffet, but a poor man that will eat anything buffet.  The pizza when hot and fresh was decent. The salad bar wasn't half bad, better than I expected. The other reviews are dead on with the not ice cream stuff.  
The place as a whole was decently clean. For a Saturday they held up with the crowd. 
The prices are pretty much the reason we won't be back. $9.99 for everybody in the door. Then $14.99 for using the few rides for a couple hours.  They did have to rotate the staff on rides as mentioned in other reviews, making waits for the little kids longer.  
So in short, we went and tried it. We won't be back though.  $25 for kids is a little high for what they have available."}
{"text":"Would not honor all components of the Groupon birthday package. Spoke to multiple managers showed them proof of what we were supposed to get and still wouldn't honor Groupon deal. Will not come back again"}
{"text":"We went in here to just have a little family fun on a Sunday. We weren't familiar with this place but we have been in similar types of places. First of all this place is a dump! The bathrooms smelled like urine (ladies) so I could only imagine how the men's smelled. This place is run by teenagers so I guess that's what you should expect. We couldn't believe that as adults that didn't plan on playing games nor riding rides have to pay an admission fee of $14.95 just to walk through the doors... Really!? The girl at the front counter claims it's because the buffet is included as they have no way to watch who is eating.. Really then what is the arm band for? After visiting the restroom the last thing I wanted to do was EAT the \"food\"\"... So for $48 our son got to ride 2 rides, Play $5 worth of games that they include on the \"fun pass\" and eat one ice cream cone which by the way was crap! We decided since we paid for the food that we would load up... We quickly realized the food looked in-edible. So we loaded up and threw it all away! The worst place we've ever visited! After being there for about 45 minutes we left.. Couldn't get out if there fast enough!"}
{"text":"Great place for the kids... and adults...

Cosmic bowling, car racing, rock wall, air hockey, various little-kid rides, and  tons of video games. It also has several different themed dining rooms and lots of food to choose from. Admittance gets you all you can eat food, and access to video games -- rides and bowling cost extra.

We have a blast every time we go."}
{"text":"I thought this would be a great place to take the kids, a comparable place to Chuck E Cheese, yet it was not! The food was terrible and the amount they charge to play one game is astronomical. You pay the $10 fee just to enter the door and then on top of that each game costs $1 to $5. Talk about a rip-off. I swiped my card, the game started and after the push of one button to drop a ball, the game was over and I was charged $1.5. I'm taking my kids to a water park next time and I'm sure they will enjoy themselves more, not to mention, I'll save a lot of money. :)"}
{"text":"The best place ever!!! So worth the price when u purchase the unlimited!! We were literally there for 6 hours that's how much fun we were having!! The food was great! Plus they serve beer! Definitely can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The buffets food quality is horrendous. After being there 3 hours they put out only 2 new pizzas out. There are many adults and children who grab pieces of dessert and pizza with their bare hands as the multiple staff members just watch. Bowling alley and game card attendance wrestled on the ground while my fiance and I were waiting for 5 minutes to be helped. This place is unclean and has a horrible staff working.One cool thing is the cool arcade and ticket games along with a good prize selection."}
{"text":"It doesn't really feel fair to give Amazing Jake's 4 stars, because there are really two experiences going on within those walls.  You've got the culinary struggle, and then the action from all the games/rides.

Based on food alone, they'd get a generous 2 stars, with the only saving grace being their limited salad bar.  All of the other pabulum aint fab-u-lum.  They should could call it \"ween cuisine\", cuz all it takes is one time Cuz, and you wont be back no mowww (what you say!).  Mushroom fettuccine sounds delightful, until you get a punch from whatever that whacky-ass oyster essence is.

The pizza was a train wreck... a train wreck with fatalities... that spilled like 1000 gallons of ammonia, which threatens to asphyxiate the nearest small town.

Man, go to Cici's buffet.  See what those playas bring to the table for $5, and then try to replicate.  Better yet, take $100 from the till and hit the nearest Little Caesars.  Daaaang!

The dessert case proudly boasts \"Freshly Baked\"... what you don't know, is what month it was freshly baked, cuz Money, it wadn't today.

And I know the difference between ice cream, frozen yogurt, and frickin ice milk.  Ya hoodwinked me, G!  

But in the eyes of a 4yo, this place is almost as fun as Disneyland.  She was sooo excited to go on all of the rides, so if you've got a little adrenaline junkie too, the mini coaster will hold the pinnacle of thrills.

And one word of advice.  When you're leaving, and you see that free photo kiosk hanging on the wall, where you can email the photo to yourself... the touch screen is way out of calibration.  Check the email address twice before you hit send.  Even after checking it, you still may not get your portrait sent to you... and that makes daddy sad."}
{"text":"More in the range of a 3.5, this place is definitely better than some of your other run of the mill arcade/food/bowling/laser tag...etc places.  

Sure, there are lots of minis running around screaming (which explains my rating_), but there are attractions for the older crowd too.  If I had kids, I probably would have rated it a four.  However, it's a little pricey, running at $22 per adult.  There are lots of different pricing packages depending on what you might want to indulge in.  I was treated for free though...otherwise I might not have gone of my own accord.

Oh thank goodness for the bar!

Margaritas for $6, good amount of alcohol, but a little on the pricey side.  It did make for a fun round of laser tag though.  Okay so I made for a good target....oh well.

The sports bar was a really nice area for sports junkies to watch various favorites on the tv.

Lots of different arcade games, all the general ones.  The card swipey system was a little tough to deal with, what with the games reading the card sometimes and sometimes needing to swipe several times.  All but two ticket counters were broken as well, which made for long lines.

It's a great place to people watch, especially on the rock climbing.  You'd think that if someone kept losing their grip at a certain section they would try a different route instead of going up and falling at the same point at least 5 times.

The food was surprisingly good for a place like this, tons of things to choose from and tasty to boot.  Now it's not gourmet, mind you, but compared to similar places, I'd say Amazing Jake's food is higher on the quality scale.  It's all you can eat, so at least it makes spending all that money to enter the place feel a little worth it.

Would I go again?  Maybe if I ever have kids, for a family outing.  I had fun, and the laser tag was by far worth doing....but once was enough for me."}
{"text":"The games are old and a lot of them didn't work. There were so many people here that we circled round and round trying to find an open game to play. The staff were a little off putting. It seems like the ghetto of Mesa has taken over. Too bad, this place used to be awesome. But for the price, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is average.  Clean and well maintained.  Prices are high and you don't get many tickets on games.  My kids love the place.  Plan to come at lunch to eat...play games then eat again before leaving to get your monies worth."}
{"text":"First time her they staff is friendly . I would like to thank Lorenzo for his kindness and making the birthday girl so happy on her special day. It's very clean.  Just wish they had more things for small kids to play with.
I don't feel right they charge a admission fee, it's not a theme park. We will stick to Dave and Buster."}
{"text":"Birthday party for my son - first time here pretty impressed so far. Spent the entire afternoon enjoying Amazing Jakes for my son's 13th Birthday Party.

Very cool place for kids. The only problem I had was that there are no lockers to put valuables for the adults. For the parents this means that someone is always stuck at the table watching the \"stuff.\" I did happen to make the suggestion to the manager this evening while picking up the remainder of our birthday cake.

Over all very impressive place. Yes it's a little bit more than the average, but when you break it down it is worth it.

Age appropriate for 8 and up especially."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Amazing Jakes for over 7 years and it sad to see the deterioration of this place. I remember coming here around 2009 and the buffet was terrible -the pizza was awful and the salad bar was disgusting but since then the buffet has shaped up and offers some really great options for your little rabbits. But the dessert side was pitiful on this trip -I didn't even bother. A few sugar cookies, sugar cinnamon chips? and soft serve -not like brownies, rice crispy treats of yesteryear. :( 

Question: Why is the obvious room (kids tv & movies) that everyone sits in seems like the smallest one out of all of theme rooms? 

The games are mostly broken or about to fall apart -see photo. The rides seem ok -my nieces (9&4) always have a good time riding them. 
I don't stand too close to that rollercoaster thing since some little kid upchucking on me wouldn't be cute. 
It seems like the popular ride is the go-carts but the track is way too small. 
I was sad to see on this trip they closed the mini golf area -why? Seems like they could put some more rides in there or even a bigger track for the go-carts!?
The bowling alley part is nice - in the past I have played but not on this trip. 
The toddler area needed a good vacuum -go ahead vacuum and Stanley steamer the whole place please! 

I only come here when I don't pay full price (reduced for company events etc) and I don't think I will come if I have to pay full price for everything."}
{"text":"Really horrible customer service. Spoke to
Nicole over the phone a few days to prior about group arrangements only to have her deny what she initially promised. She was extremely condescending and dishonest. Will be in touch with the \"general\" manager to follow up with how dissatisfied and disrespected we were."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I decided to give this place a try for an afternoon out of the office.  I must say, we were all impressed.  We had low expectations going in, given the poor food quality and surroundings in competitor's facilities (i.e. Peter Piper, Fiddlesticks).  The margarita machine wasn't working, but two of my coworkers tried the beer and wine, and they were pleased.  The macaroni is excellent, and the pizza's pretty good too!  They have many choices in the fountain beverages.  The salad bar was also appealing and pleasing.  My only disappointment was with the desserts, which just didn't taste as good as the rest of the food.  Also, I don't know if there's mold in the place or what, but we were all coughing and suffering from sore throats by the day's end.  Not sure if we'll be back to this location, but I wouldn't say no if I were invited.  They also have great packages which include use of the games and other entertainment facilities, like laser tag and bowling."}
{"text":"We had a fun time here at Amazing Jakes.  

Food, fun and games to spare.  It is the first indoor putt putt place that I have ever played.  The food was surprisingly decent.  The buffet offered a lot with the main thing as PIZZA, a kid's favorite.

With kids running all over, it exciting to see all those happy faces.

One complaint would be in the private party room it smelled almost too sanitized, if that is possible?...lay off the pine sol ha jk.

All in all it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty food! expensive! And drunk adults everywhere! Not a family friendly place to have your child's birthday party. Very filthy place everything you touch is sticky Yulkkkk! Go karts seat belts pop off and go karts tip over I've seen children being badly injured and admitted to hospitals from the malfunctioning of the rides and equipment. I'm sure this place is in many safety violations."}
{"text":"Summer special $14.99 each which includes admission/buffet (alone $10.99 over age 12) and 2 hours of activities/rides which include go karts, bumper cars, carousel and bowling (shoes extra charge). This is a nice place for family and staying cool indoors when the temp is 100+ degrees outside."}
{"text":"Place was entertaining for my kids and I liked the beer selection. 

The rude staff, especially the young kid behind the ticket counter was annoying. As the guest in front of me left, the kid started making fun of him and mocking the way he spoke."}
{"text":"We always hit this place when visiting my dad.  My 11 year old daughter spends hours here.  This is probably the sweet spot for kids her age.  This is like a big Chuck E. Cheese for tweens.  When we go, we get her the unlimited pass and my wife and I just pay for admission.  Admission to watch her is like $10, but that includes food and drink, so it's not bad if you go for lunch.  The also have a bar with beer, wine and some hard alcohol.  That also eases the pain.  This time around, I brought my laptop and we watched Netflix for several hours waiting for her.

Her unlimited card is good for everything except the ticket games.  She doesn't play those so she doesn't car.  I also read that bowling shoes are extra.  Again, she's not interested.  So for us, we can kill a full day for less than $50 plus and alcoholic beverages we consume.  That's not too bad especially considering you get access to the buffet."}
{"text":"I informed the manager that I would like my money back and it's due to the fact that almost all the games were broken. She gave me my money back, but she did not even put an \"out of order\" sign on the broken games. People were still swiping the game cards and losing their money. Management like that will seriously put Amazing Jakes \"out of business\"."}
{"text":"I am 27 and I went here twice for a field trip with over 100 kids. This place is great for big parties as there are several things to do for adults and kids. For kids, there is laser tag, rock climbing, bowling, arcade games, bumper cars, a small race track, merry-go-round, tea cup ride, frog ride and  a mini coaster ride that goes in a circle. Adults can enjoy all the things kids can, but I mostly enjoyed bowling and laser tag.            


The food is decent. All the kids like the food there, but the pizza was alright.  The really good thing about their food that it is a buffet and there is a variety of things to choose from.  Their salad bar is pretty nice as it has a ton of toppings.  I enjoyed that quite much!  

This place is great for birthday parties I imagine as it feels very safe and there is tons to do!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean place. Bowling was excellent, Buffet was well above average. Tasty pizza, and surprisingly good, fresh salad bar!"}
{"text":"As strange as it may seem, I'm pretty sure there were more adults than kids here.  Amazing Jake's is a great place for food, fun, and some sports on the tv.  They have all sorts of silly themed rooms to eat your food in, my favorite (and my husband's favorite) being the sports themed room.  They have a giant projection screen in there where they usually play games on.  The food here is pretty decent.  I am kind of a fan of terrible buffet/cafeteria style food, and AJ's hits it right on the head here.  Yum.  Don't come expecting amazing food.  There is also, of course, a giant area with tons of fun arcade games to make you feel like a kid again.  I had a blast when I went here with my husband.  Amazing Jake's is definitely a fun place to forget about the outside world and be like a kid again."}
