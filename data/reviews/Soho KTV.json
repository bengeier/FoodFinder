{"text":"Great location. Friendly service. Very good place to hang out with friends. There is also a lounge bar in there where you can order from the bar.
Or you can use the private room for free with minimum charge. Overall an amazing karaoke.
The best one I have been to. p.S tons of the most popular songs in English and other languages."}
{"text":"I was there during Happy Hour on Sunday. Service is extremely bad, place is super dirty, very disappointed. 

Price: On website, it's showing $11.99 for 2 drinks. My friend called to make reservation, the person on the phone confirmed the price is $11.99 but only with 1 drink. When we got there, they said it's $15 including tax and \"cleaning fee\" excluding tips. 

Time: On website, it's showing Happy Hour is 2pm-8pm. On the phone the person said it's 3pm-8pm. When we were there, the lady came to give our bill at around 6:45pm and said we need to leave before 7:30pm because they need to clean the room so people who made reservation at 8pm can use it right at 8...

Environment: The place smells. It smells like cigarette plus puke. Room is not clean. There are balloons and other stuff left behind from the people before us. The washroom is extremely dirty. One washroom stall is broken and leaning inward, door is gone and the stall looks like it's about fall anytime soon. All stalls but the broken one have no toilet paper. One sink is clogged and it looks like the water is about to overflow. 

Drinks: When we ordered drinks, they said they can give us two pitchers instead because they don't have enough glasses...we asked how do we drink from the pitcher then? They said they will provide the disposable cups. When the first pitcher came, it's only three quarter, because we order hot drink. The second one is more because we ordered cold drink and there's ice. Both drinks were watered down as well. 

Overall Experience: I will never go back again and definitely will not recommend this place to anyone. As a matter of fact I will tell anyone that's looking for a karaoke place to stay as far away from this place as possible."}
{"text":"There isn't really too many karaoke places in York Region anymore. I have seen this one here and there but have never been so finally checked it out recently. 
Let's get the good things out of the way:
- located in Commerce Gate and there was free parking
- song selection is decent, they have many of the new Chinese songs, and easy to choose songs
- $15 pp which includes ONE drink, and includes tax and tip. Fair and average price for happy hour
- Happy hour starts from 2-8 pm. Longer than  many other KTV places
- room was pretty big

The BAD
- I cannot breathe in the room. It's so smokey. I know there's a no smoking sign on the door but obviously people don't follow the rules and the staff there don't enforce it so hence, very smokey rooms. Literally cannot breathe but we toughed it out anyways
- there was old balloons hanging in the room, deflated foil balloon, deflated happy birthday balloons, some random pair of used latax gloves (ewwww)
- dirty spots on table and seats
- no garbage bin in room or in the washrooms.. no where to throw paper towel 
- they told us we had to pay an hour before the time's up. When we paid, our chosen song list got wiped out. 

So we sang, and we got a drink, and that was that. We enjoyed the singing but can't say we enjoyed the experience. We all agreed we will never ever go back here. It's not only dirty but also smelly. Now I gotta go wash my coat and my hair a few times."}
