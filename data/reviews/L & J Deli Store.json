{"text":"By far the best \"Cuban sandwich\" creation ever. Juan puts homemade pork chops, chicken, pastrami, and roast beef. It's a pretty healthy portion that has great flavors! I would recommend all of Madison to come and try this sandwich and his deli!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Cuban Sandwiches (and more) and excellent service. We had the chance to try it in my recent visit to the University of Wisconsin, where my son attends, and we were taken care by Ray the manager, who took his time to make what I can only describe one if not the best Cuban sandwiches in the US, not too mention that they are huge. We highly recommend it"}
{"text":"My steak mofongo was so flippin' delish that I almost smacked myself. It was packed with deliciously seasoned tender steak. The plantains were seasoned with garlic and were semi smashed to make a moist, but dry, crust. Not the bad kind of dry, by any means. He threw in a garnish of tomato lettuce and avocado with a dressing. The dressing was similar to thousand island without the relish and a bit sweet. Everything together was a hit! I tried the chicken mofongo also, and it was just as good. A friend ordered the tostones plate with chicken and the tostones were crunchy and flavorful. I hear that the college students come for the cubano sandwiches. I may have to stop back for one myself! I definitely will be back for another mofongo plate. Yum!"}
