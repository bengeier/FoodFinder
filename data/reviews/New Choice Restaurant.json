{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. The waiters were really rude to us and were really unwilling to listen to any of our requests and were talking behind our backs for something so minute. Not to mention the mediocre quality dishes too. Will definitely never come back!"}
{"text":"1 star for being edible and another star for being open late into the night when all others have closed.   Would only come back if in the area and desperate for food when all else have closed (which is probably why 99% of the people are there for). Food was barely above food court (Manchu Wok) quality.  My theory is this place survives on the late night crowd or people seeking low prices. Food looks and tastes like chinese food court of 10 years ago. Too much soy sauce on the rice, some plate portions were small and black burnt grill bits were peppering my tofu dish.  Visited around 11:30pm and place was full and constant turnover. Only around a 5 minute wait however would be longer if you came earlier probably.  Waiters were grumpy and never smiled and were snappy and actually was arguing with another table about their food taking to long.  However in their defense this is one of the worst shifts as tired and hungry late night diners is not the best customers to serve!  Go here expecting something edible in the middle of the night.  Don't go here expecting the pinnacle of chinese cuisine.  ... and if you are a loyal regular coming here during daytime hours when everything is still open, do yourself a favor and expand your palate by trying any other chinese restaurant for a change of scenery."}
{"text":"Came for dinner. We ordered fish and tofu hot pot, tong choy with fermented bean paste, and half crispy skin chicken. The portions are huge here and the bowl of rice was packed like a mountain. I couldn't even finish my bowl of rice. The dishes had good wok hay.  The chicken was just ok, I had better elsewhere and would not order that again. This is a solid Cantonese rest. Would recommend and come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I share the same sentiments as one of the reviewers who mentioned food is decent and priced cheap - and that the chicken rice with ginger/green onion dish is okay.  It came with free drink.  Service was so-so.    We ordered a wonton noodle as well and it took a while to arrive.  It came way after my chicken rice.  Wonton definitely not on par with a specialized wonton restaurant but we wanted a noodle soup at that moment."}
{"text":"Worst experience forever. Poor customer service, the food was just so so, cannot really compare with other restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday evening for dinner. Ordered 6 dishes including a steamed fish. All the other dishes came out first and by the time the fish arrived we were practically finished with the other dishes. The fish was really good though, it wasn't over cooked. I was a little disappointed in their chefs special fried rice though, it did not stand out and I probably won't be ordering it again. Overall, the meal was decent, I would return if someone picked to eat here but it wouldn't be one of my first choices."}
{"text":"Great Cantonese \"wok hay\" restaurant! Awesome seafood as well, their steamed fish is very fresh and done just right. Lobster and crab are delicious and you can request to have it done different ways.  Sizzling dishes are also pretty good although it gets a little smokey since it literally comes out of the kitchen Sizzling.   This place gets pretty packed with at night since its on the small side, and remember it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I had ! The soft shell crab costs $19.8  with very little crab but mostly deep fried batter, terrible taste! The Tung Choi with Bean curd sauce was not stir fried but boiled. Tasted mushy and very little taste.  Costs $11.95 and we took one mouthful and left the rest untouched. When I asked the Waitress, Kitty, why the vegetable was boiled instead stir fried, she said they always boiled the vegetables first and then just put the cooked vegetables in the wok for a few seconds to create the illusion that you are getting the traditional Chinese Stirred Fried food! To add insult to injury, she added 13.6% service charge to my bill without telling me. When I confronted her, she said this is their policy now. But nowhere on the menu stated this automatic service charge!  Food: 1/10. Service: 1/10.  Attitude: -10.  I will never go back to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant in Canada. I've been here probably a 100 times and they have never disappointed me.   I usually get their general tao and it's to die for Soo crispy and tasty, also the are not shy with the quantity of food they serve.  I would also suggest getting their stir fried beef with black pepper sauce. This I would always order with the general tao because the black pepper sauce counters the sweetness and makes it very enjoyable.  In conclusion I would highly recommend this place to anyone very good food at a very good price"}
{"text":"Almost perfect, this place has amazing portions to price ratio. Huge meals for pretty cheap, its family style so its great if you want to try several dishes with friends. This place also only takes cash so that's a bit inconvenient. The service is pretty good aswell so overall this was a good dining experience. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my family and this restaurant was packed. We didn't have a reservation but luckily just had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a large table that can seat 12 people.  We took a look at the menu and asked the waiter for recommendations to which he pointed at the dinner set (written in Chinese) of about 10 items for $198. I thought he took the easy way out and should've told us what is popular in this restaurant or the fresh catch of the day, ecetera. And what do you mean you don't have mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts?! As for the dinner set - is it bad that I don't remember what exactly the dishes were? Clearly not too memorable. Unfortunatly I cannot read Chinese so I do not know the exact name of the things we had. I just remember there were 2 lobsters, squabs, chicken, young chow fried rice, some noodles dish, veggies, and a fish. We added sweet and sour fried porkchops. Free \"tong sui\" dessert at the end. Everything was okay, nothing to write home about.   The food is good enough that I would only come to this restaurant for convenience. I would not come here if it is out of the way.  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"My future sister in-law's friend recommended this restaurant to try out for dinner so my fiance, his family and I came here for dinner on our third night at Markham, ON. The restaurant was quite small and not very fancy. I would say it's okay to come here with a small group, not a large group The tables feel a bit small, probably can only fit 9-10 people tops. The staff were okay, but a bit forgetful.   I felt the quality of the food wasn't too special and it certainly didn't wow me either. We got about 7-9 dishes, most of which you can have in the NYC Chinatown or Flushing. There was one pork chop dish I found to be interesting and delicious, but too bad I don't remember what the name was. It was one of the restaurant's signature dishes. It was sweet, tangy, and smothered with their delicious sauce.  We also ordered a lobster, but they didn't remember until towards the end of our meal. They ended up bringing it out for us, so that was nice of them.   Overall, I thought the restaurant was just okay. It's not a place I would want to really return to unless my family wanted to and if I can get that pork chop next time. The decor and atmosphere  felt a bit out of date. If you're looking for a simple dinner this is the place to go, but if you're for something a little extra and nice - consider somewhere else instead.  Note: They ONLY take cash."}
{"text":"I am from California but when I visit family in Toronto, I make sure to eat at new choice. Hands down the best Chinese food in town in the tri state area. Best late night munchies spot after coming out from the club as well. The chocolate beef can only be explained with two words, MOUTH WATERING. The stir fried snows peas are to die for. Be sure to get your food ordered by the chinese waiter with the flat top haricut and the bow tie. He's legit.   Will definitely dine there again. The only reason i gave it a 4 out of 5 star is because the place can use a renovation. Not a place to take a date to if your trying to be classy. :-)"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a friday night. It was relatively busy, which is always a good sign. This is an old school cantonese style restaurant. went to this restaurant with a friend.   We ordered 3 dishes, the Beef with mushroom, hot pot garoupa with tofu, and  braised pork belly with lotus root.   Honestly of the three dishes the hot pot and the beef with mushroom were the best, and the last one was not bad. however it did not stand out as much as the other two. This restaurant is pretty authentic when it comes to the food, and the portions are average, it is decent enough.   It is of course this type of restaurant you usually bring with family and friends, in an area where there is a abundant of chinese restaurant, this one still stands out as pretty good and old school.  i would definitely recommend it to people who have a craving for good cantonese cuisine.   The Lobster which i had last time is also a dish i would recommend highly as they are very good with seafood."}
{"text":"Ive gone in 2 times and I'm not sure if i'd go back. On both ocassions I ordered the exact same thing. The last time they tried to charge me more money. I pointed it out to the lady. she rolled her eyes and have me back the difference. I got the chicken corn soup and general Tao chicken. It was really good. The chicken is really moist but not spicy enough. The corn soup is right on point. I went in the last time and got the Chili chicken. It wasn't spicy at all. It tasted like black bean chicken with sauce/gravy. Wouldn't order that again. The restaurant itself is kinds run down looking. Everything is old and out dated. There is always people in there when I go and they areopen til 4-5am which I think is great, considering in this area (hey 7 & bayview) not much is open, unless you want mc Donalds at valleymede. Id consider going back."}
{"text":"Summary: popular late night spot is good for big groups, and gets most - but not all - of its dishes right.  Top Must-Get: \"Running\" chicken Top Regret: Egg and pork congee  We came here to try something new for a post-sports meal as a group of 12 on a Wednesday night around 10:30 pm. They definitely had a busy vibe going, with several tables being served right before and after we got there - we chose this because of their reputation as a late night food spot.  SERVICE We ended up getting a dinner set which went for about $110, tax in. We were seated pretty quickly and they took our order within 10 minutes. After a short wait, the dishes came one after another in fairly rapid succession.  They were great about getting us a pitcher of water and refilling it constantly (I'm a particular thirsty kind of guy).  FOOD We ordered a variety of dishes including a \"running\" chicken, sweet/sour pork, egg pork congee, fried dough stick, garlic fried gai lan (Chinese broccoli), tofu and fish, and beef fried noodles.  Everything was fairly good, although nothing stood out as spectacular. THE TWO EXCEPTIONS: the congee (pae dan soh yuk jook) was very, very bland (we had to add copious amounts of salt and pepper, although it's not that bad with dough sticks), and the tofu fish was extraordinarily salty.  For what we got - which was 9 dishes - it was pretty good value and left us satisfied."}
{"text":"October 22, 2016 around 10:45pm. The waiter with spiked hair is very rude when I ordered by phone for take out. He would just hang up the phone after taking your order. It is not the first time he did that. Is it because I don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese?  Upon picking up the take out order, he would give me a dagger look when I just requested for a chili sauce. When I was giving my cash payment, he didn't want to get it from my hand. He tapped the table to signal to put the cash over there. Very very rude S.O.B.!!!  I am a paying and courteous customer and he has no reason to do that. The owner should train their mostly uneducated staff to respect customers, whether Chinese or not."}
{"text":"i went to this on christmas eve and it was packed. good thing was our group made reservations ahead of time for 8 people. Given our group size, we wanted to really order seafood in this restaurant, so we ordered a 6 pound lobster with 2 flavours and a steamed garlic oyster for our seafood portion. We also ordered hot plate beef, as well as A-choy, and a seafood fried rice.   The Lobster with the salt and pepper mix was very good, it is definitely a signature dish of theres, much better then the steamed one we had with garlic and green onion. The Steamed oyster with garlic was by far the best dish out of all their dishes, as it was cooked perfectly and the seafood was very fresh.   Overall the price for this restaurant is pretty decent, the service of course left much to be desired, as the wait staff, only some were responsible and quick, others were impolite and ignored us. The lady wait staffed for some reason tended to ignore us and brush us off when we order food or ask for service. where as the male wait staffed actually did their job   i would recommend definitely people to try this restaurant and it is also has late night hours till 4 am so available at any time."}
{"text":"New Choice has decent food and late hours and that is about where it ends.   The cleanliness of the restaurant is questionable at best. It is not kept well most of the time which can be gross when you're trying to eat. Their cups are usually dirty.   I would say 90% of their employees do not speak English which is extremely annoying because they give you a clueless stare when you order and as opposed to making sure they have your order down correctly, they make guesses and bring you the wrong order.   On the other hand, the one's that do speak English, are rude, uninviting and try to rush you with your order.  Also, they do not accept reservations and are cash only. I personally do not know many restaurants that do not accept debit or visa/mastercard other than New Choice.   Overall, I would not recommend this place. It is too bad because their food is not half bad."}
{"text":"Very few places have the combination of a top notch atmosphere with top of the line cuisine. Whether it's the sizzly beef or the chicken fried rice, New Choice is a Richmond Hill must eat."}
{"text":"Located in a strip plaza where most of the restaurants are open until the wee hours of the morning, even during the week. This restaurant seems to be the most popular among the late night restaurants in this plaza. Plenty of patrons even very late at night.   Note that they DO NOT take credit or debit. Cash only."}
{"text":"I visit New Choice Restaurant whenever I am looking for cheap chinese food. Its the closest one near by with a good price. The service and food there are inconsistant. Majority of the time the experience will be good, but you could have some off days. Best bet is ordering take out instead of dine in, but even then sometimes the order might be incorrect. They have a very wide variety of food, but some of their specialty menus are only in Chinese. With me being CBC (Chinese Born Canadian) I don't know how to read all of that. Upside to New Choice is that they are open late to around 3am or 4am and their beers are the same price as their closing times ($3 domestic or $4 import) WOW!! SO GUUD!! Great place to be if you want cheap food and drinks, and they have also renovated recently. Try it out and find out if New Choice will be your New Choice!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy! It's the go to place after hours! Service could improve but hey! I love the food so much I keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to New Choice.  I had wanted to try it for awhile, but I could not cramp in it last 2 times.  New Choice has a BIG following.  First tip of the day: come around 6:00pm or after 8:00pm to get a table easy for weekend.  You should expect to wait if you arrive after 6:30pm.    They gave us 2 menus: one is for the more expensive dishes, and the other one is the house menu book.  OMG!  Most of the dishes in the house menu are $10 and under, including many meat dishes.  We ordered solely from the house menu, so I could not comment on the expensive menu.  I did notice that one of the expensive items was giant lobster.  We ordered a Braised Duck with Taro in Sweet & Sour Plum sauce ($10), a Cherry Clam Stir Fry ($14), and a Stir Fried Vegetable with Garlics ($9).  The Braised Duck was too sour for my liking, and it had too much taro.  The cherry clam and the vegetable dishes tasted fine.  What impressed me the most was that none of the dishes were grossly oily.  The oiliness level was similar to the typical stir fries in Hong Kong.  The interior is contemporary and clean.  The waiters and waitresses are too busy to be attentive.  If you get their attention, the services are efficient.  New Choice operates a formula of ultra low prices, nice interior seating, variety of dishes and average cooking.  The magic formula successfully earns it a large following, including many non-Chinese, based on the observation of my 3, admittedly twice were unsuccessful, visits.  Despite that it doesn't cook the most elegant dishes, I don't think its customers mind at all.  3 stars for food; 3.5 stars for overall value and experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best chinese restro I goes to :) they provide fast and very nice service."}
{"text":"An absolute gem for Chinese cuisine! Always open late, in case you have an early morning craving, and a great venue for dining with big groups. I recommend the Szechuan chicken and breaded garlic shrimp with no shell. You'll not find a better place in all of the GTA for these two items. Become a regular and they'll know you by name. This place can get busy around dinner and is usually buzzing with guests, so plan your trip accordingly. Cash only so come prepared!"}
{"text":"New Choice = Awesome I'm not sure if I even want to disclose this gem! Its open super late *until 3 or 4 am* and the food is SO GOOD AND CHEAP! fine, the interior is not modern or anything special and the food is so so so so so so good i haven't met ANYONE who didn't like this place the prices are also so low we go with 6 people and it ends up no more than $15 per person (including tax and tip) we get chicken in black bean sauce (the chicken is so moist and just amazing, tender and wonderful!) -fresh baked fish - they fish it RIGHT OUT FOR YOU! its great -steamed rice -Cantonese Chow Mein or Seafood Chow Mein -spicy salt squid - mmmm so TASTY! -the ginger garlie lobster is really my favourite -The manager (the older guy) speaks great English so that is never a problem -oh! and get the Crab corn soup [they may not have it on the menu, but they make it.. REAL crab meat)  you can come here any time.. day or night!"}
{"text":"New choice is my go to place for Chinese food and ever since they renovated I have been going more and more. We came here on the grand reopening night and it was packed!  The interior is modern, clean and less cramped than before. The menus have been updated with photos AND English (for those who can't read Chinese like me).   In terms of food, my favorite dishes include: -baked lobster with creamy cheese -baked ribs in thousand island sauce -deep fried chicken wings with chilli salt -shredded salt braised chicken -braised duck with taro in plum sauce  The list can go on with so many items on their menu. In addition, their HK style milk tea is one of my favorites. I highly recommend this place for dinner and its open late (4am) if you're craving a midnight snack.  Remember CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Go to late night snack place for after drinking in Markham and Richmond Hill area!!  My most favourite item is their Black Chicken Pot. This dish is served like hot pot.. but it uses a \"almost medicine-type\" broth base - which is really really important.  The broth here is definitely one of the best!!!!!!!!! Has never disappointed any my guests who know of and eat this dish occasionally! I wouldn't claim it's the best. But for a fast food and late night snack place, it is definitely second to none. Hence 5 star rating.  Everything else is 4 stars. I would also especially recommend fresh seafood stir-fry from here. Different types of clams and shell fish."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!! Black hair in my food and server tried convincing it was mine when I have red hair...  poor service and dirty place. Yuck never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre Chinese food spot. It tastes better late-night on the way home from an alcohol-fueled night of debauchery. It's open later than most of the other Chinese places in the area, but if you're eating during regular business hours you'll be better off visiting some of the other nearby options. The food is pretty salty, oily and all around average."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go to, whether it's for a casual dinner or especially when you've got a late night craving because they're open super late!   CASH only at this restaurant, but worth every penny because their quality of food is excellent. Service is average and seating is very casual. This is definitely my go-to spot whenever I'm hungry at night. Huge variety of HK style dishes including seafood, meat, and much more!"}
{"text":"Really good late hour restaurant! Most of the food is good. Try black paper beef and sweet and sour chicken. The hot and sour soup is spicy but very recommended as well."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese food! Many new dishes added after the renovations. Favorite dish is their one of a kind Butter & Cheese Lobster and Grill pork's neck."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for lunch. I always order the same 2 dishes: - ?????? ($6.95): crispy beef noodle - ?????? ($6.95): minced pork egg plant noodle  And my parents like: - ???? ($5.95): bbq pork shrimp fried rice - ???? ($6.95): chicken rice  Recently, I discovered another tasty dish: - ?????? ($6.95): this is pretty good if you like both ingredients..chinese sausage and salty fish fried rice  All lunch comes with a drink..just cannot beat the price and also, their food is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is cheap and decent. Most items come with milk tea. Their chicken rice dish is pretty good however.  Service isn't great. Servers are grumpy and rude.   Clean interior. Washrooms could use an update however.  If you're looking for something cheap, this is the place. Open late but cash only so hit up the atm."}
{"text":"what a wonderful place for authentic chinese food, their lobsters are mouth watering, and golden eels are a must order dish,  best of all, it is the cheapest place for quality sea food"}
{"text":"One of the oldest spots in Thornhill/Richmond hill, located at a small little spot on Hwy 7 close to yonge st/Bathurst.  I used to dine here often...the best thing about this place is that it stays open very late, i think until about 3 or 4am. The main server who's been there forever is Johnny, he speaks an okay english, otherwise, There is a big language barrier with all staff members if you're a foreigner to the chinese/mandarin language, so keep that in mind before you go in.. don't expect a high end customer service at this place what so ever, but the flavours are definitely there.  My favourite dish in there is the black bean sauce and hot pepper beef steak, it's one of the best I have ever tried. The Wontons are also great, Gong bao and szechwan chilli chicken.  Big portions, somewhat mid-range prices, good food when you're hungry after hours, below average service."}
{"text":"A moment of weakness: as it was close to midnight and almost everything else in the plaza were closed and after eating Double Inferno earlier, I don't think I should be having more spicy food! And I made the wrong decision to come to New Choice Restaurant again.  I guess I should have learn from my own experience and read my own review using my Yelp App before walking through the doors... but New Choice is open till 4 am.. it cannot be worse than my lunch special...  I was WRONG!  The only thing that I enjoyed was the Plain Congee ($1.50) in its purity with no added seasoning or ingredients... I was just so glad we ordered that and we even order another bowl!  I have to declare I have the worst Taiwanese Three-Cup Chicken ($9.95) in my life, where's the 3 cup -  each of soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil and where's the ginger and basil? Why are the chicken so heavily battered deep fried and gluey? After one bite, I just couldn't eat that and I thought I ordered the wrong dish! You sure that's chicken?!  I confirmed with the kitchen again and he said it is the 3-Cup Chicken!!   Taiwanese Style Stir Fried ($5.95) was as bad. The tofu was deep fried to crispy dryness. At least I enjoyed the peanuts as it went well with my congee.  After the renovation, the interior does feel cleaner.  Note to self, I am not coming back here again!!!!!!!!"}
