{"text":"Carry out only! Have been here numerous times just because I want to like it and it's close to home. Never again!! Cold in dining room. Bugs flying around every time I've been there. Boring atmosphere!! Don't dine in. Food decent but plenty of other places to go to!! The macaroni pizza is great if you eat it at home!!"}
{"text":"this place was exactly what my boyfriend and i were looking for. we both got manicotti and it was fantastic! the service was good and friendly and i left feeling incredibly full. can't wait to go back to try more things on their extensive menu :)"}
{"text":"We visited here on a Saturday mid-afternoon. Not another soul in the place. We were greeted and sat down, service was prompt. Went to the restroom... \"Men's out of order, please use Women's\". Hmmmm. Big sheet of black plastic across another part of the restaurant - not very attractive. While we sat waiting for our pizza, there were dozens of flies everywhere around us. Decided to take it to-go. Pizza was decent but the restaurant itself is disappointing."}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if I could. I ordered for delivery and the delivery guy must have dropped the pizza b/c half the toppings had slid off into the side of the box. Grease literally dripping THROUGH the cardboard and on top of that it took over an hour! I called to let the manager know I wasn't thrilled (in a nice way) and he offered to bring me a new pizza (after waiting over an hour for this one? Um I think I'll just eat what I have) but no future discount. Which settles that - Never trying this place again. And honestly it's mostly based on principal - poor poor customer service."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. Great menu with Class A selection. Price is higher but worth it."}
{"text":"Though it may not look like a lot from the outside, Picassos makes some of the best thin crust pizza in Madison.  Living in Fitchburg it is a great alternative to chain pizza like pizza hut or dominoes, and ingredients and flavors that are more fresh and unique than other local favorites such as glass nickel or roman candle pizza.  I highly suggest the roman ruler if you are into the supreme sort.

The only problem some may have with Picassos is the price, which is probably double what you pay at pizza hut, but you get what you pay for.  They run coupons in many of the local monthly coupon books that we receive in the mail, so we usually can get a large for the price of a medium, or a second half off to offset the cost.

Overall it's one of my top 3 pizza places in town and they offer a full dine in Italian menu and wine/beer offerings which I have always wanted to try."}
{"text":"I'm always looking to try new restaurants and was in the mood for pizza and came across Picasso's. My boyfriend and I loved it!! We each got a 10\" pizza. I got a create your own with tomato sauce and my bf got the bbq chicken. Both were excellent!! I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner. 

We dined in but they do have delivery as well. The manager stopped by our table and asked us how everything was-he was very nice & appreciative of our business.

It's got a more ma & pa feel to it, rather than a typical franchise restaurant such as Pizza Hut, Rocky's, domino's, Caesars, etc. It's thin crust style and there are tons of ingredients to choose from, including Gouda cheese 

I definitely recommend trying Picasso's, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One was the lowest I could give , after ordering carryout 2 times with short waits but no pressure I ordered on my way to work one night. Their pizza is good but waiting 20 minutes for a carryout on my way to work after calling 40 minutes ahead is not acceptable! Nevermore!"}
{"text":"Great hand crafted pizza and prompt, friendly service. Thank  You!"}
{"text":"This might be the worst service I have ever witnessed. Multiple customers received the wrong order. I waited over 50 minutes for a take-out order.  I received one of the two pizzas I ordered, and it got cold while waiting for the second."}
{"text":"First time dining in. I've been a fan of Picasso's \"pizza\" for about a year, but never had ordered anything else. Well, this weekend I did. In fact, I went twice this weekend. The service, our server was Mackenzie, was very personable and totally customer focused. The smoked chicken, tortellini and pesto was AWESOME. And because I'm a desert-a-holic, I tried the chocolate cheese cake. I'm hooked. Thanks for a couple of great dinners this weekend...and I will for SURE be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night for dinner and were pleasantly surprised.  It was quite good and reasonably priced.  I had the lasagna, which was excellent.  Lots of cheese, great sauce, and lots of cheese.  My wife had the pesto chicken tortellini, which was also excellent.  Good portion sizes.  Wonderful salad with the meal, too.  Cozy and not noisy.  I look forward to trying more of their entrees and pizza.  Service was a tad bit slow, but that was actually good since it created a more relaxed atmosphere (didn't feel rushed to finish).

I would recommend Picasso's to anyone and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a new location for Picasso's from Fitchburg.  Ordered pizza's recently to check it out.  Very average.  Probably won't order them again.

Check that.  We've gone back recently for a couple of meals.  Both were pretty decent.  I still think the pizza lacks seasoning and has a very bland flat bread like crust.  But the pasta dishes, including t he lasagna, were tasty.  Would like to see more non-cream sauces and vegatarian options."}
{"text":"Our first visit, right after they opened in McFarland, was fair, although the pizzas were aggressively priced.  Not to mention nearly $4 for a little pile of greens called a 'side salad'.  Ahem, right.

Our second visit was much more successful- I ordered the lasagna, Mister ordered a chicken caesar.  Both were good, and the pesto hidden in the lasagna was a tasty treat.  

Service was good, as were the leftovers!"}
{"text":"I had gone here for pizza a long time ago (Chicago style stuffed) and liked it, and after the people we originally decided on to cater our wedding went out of business, I tried their pasta entrees as a potential wedding dinner, and my (now) husband and I quickly made the decision to have Picasso's food at our wedding. This place may be best known for their pizza but the pasta entrees are also really quite good, especially those with smoked meat (which is smoked in-house) and pesto (made from scratch). There is one with smoked chicken and roasted red pepper that I love. We had one with smoked chicken and wild mushroom sauce at our wedding, which was also amazing. The lasagna is hands down the best I have ever had. The last time we went here, the outdoor patio was open and there was a fire burning in the fire pit and a gentleman playing a guitar. I tried their pizza again that time (thin crust barbecue chicken) and it was still good, the ingredients were well balanced and tasty, just enough of everything, not too much cheese, didn't flop over when you picked it up. I have now eaten here about 6 times and every time I walk out full and very happy.

Also as a note for catering - the owner does have his own event/banquet facility (The Heights in Verona) but he was more than happy to bring food out to where we had our wedding, and to design dishes that worked best for our tastes and for the type of setup we had. It was a wonderfully positive experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service,  waited over an hour for our one pizza. The cook was wandering through the dining area covered in flour. The waitress told me that they were \"out\" of cheese. Pretty sure I was waiting for someone to go to the grocery store. ..I overheard two waitresses talking about how they were pissed because the \"cook\" was DRUNK.  WONT GO BACK FOR AWHILE BUT WILL TRY AGAIN ANOTHER TIME."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza here was very good. I had some pesto chicken pizza and I would recommend it! Good flavor. 

Service wasn't great but they were pretty busy.  When our drinks were empty I thought she had forgotten about us. I always love it when they finally come running over and ask how everything is. We say (with a full mouth) good and before we can ask for a refill she starts to bolt.... what about the 2 empty glasses?? I have to ask for a refill!!?!?  I love it when wait staff are on top of your drinks. Gotta have something to wash that pie down with! 

All and all if you are in this neck of the woods and feel like some tasty italian or pizza don't be afraid to stop in and check it out I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! Stopped off here for a quick bite to eat with some friends. I didn't expect much because it's located next to a liquor store and gas station. Appearances were deceiving--the food and service were great."}
{"text":"Picasso's Pizza is my favorite pizza joint in the Madison area by virtue of their consistency and continuous quality.  There are plenty of places to get a great pizza in Madison and the surrounding area, but I find myself coming back to Picasso's time and time again.  A good part of this is the location.  Picasso's is located in an small strip mall off of Verona Road in Fitchburg.  Not exactly a chic location, but it happens to fall about halfway between my place and my best friends' in Fitchburg.  Another friend lives within walking distance.  It's the kind of place where we can all meet up, have a couple of pitchers of their excellent taps and enjoy a few of their signature pizzas.  There is even a nice seating area in the lawn out back during the summer months.  The atmosphere is always laid back and friendly.  The staff seem to always be happy to see you and are quick and efficient.

The pizzas: I personally have tried about half of the specialty pizzas and I have not come across one that I did not like.  What really sets the pizzas apart is the crispy thin crust, fresh toppings and the interesting combinations.  The crust can be too thin for some people, especially on the center pieces (square cut) which can be nearly impossible to eat by hand.  This doesn't bother me since I like mine in this style.  My personal favorites are the Venetian (spinach, artichoke, olives), Gorgonzola Ribeye (steak, onions, mushrooms & gorgonzola), Treehugger (veggie pizza with marinara) and Cajun Comfort (chicken and andouille sausage with spicy cream sauce).  I have also gotten the Chicago stuffed pizza here, which was a treat.  Not quite Giordano's, but certainly the best I've had in Madison.  It took upwards of an hour, but my parents and I enjoyed a nice bottle of wine while we waited.  Picasso's does dine in, carry out or delivery.  There have been a few times we've done delivery and not received anything for over an hour.  To be fair these have been on busy weekend nights and the pizza still came hot, but because of this we do delivery only on weeknights.

There is a whole lot of other items on the menu, much more than I have ever tried.  It seems that every time I come here I eye the pasta entrees but come back to the pizza.  One time I'll get adventuresome but I've only ventured off the pizza menu a couple of times for sandwiches.  My favorite is the Hot Hoagie, which is a toasted italian with a lot of cheese.  It's a bit sloppy (like their pizzas) but completely worth it.  The appetizers are always delicious.  I make it a point to get the garlic cheese bread just about every time, and the fried portabella mushrooms are great.  My father and I have also gotten the Cajun mussels - perfectly done, balancing the savory garlic butter with a bit of spice.  Lastly, the beer selection at Picasso's is bar none.  Even if you just go with the taps there is always an excellent selection of micros both local and national, combined with a great import selection.  There is a nice wine list too, but I rarely get past the taps to even consider it.  Picasso's is an excellent pizza place that is a lot more than pizza."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant 3 times in the past few months and have been impressed.  From the outside one can be let not to expect much but give this place a chance.  I have had pizza, pasta and a sandwich and enjoyed them all.  All items I ordered were really good and the service was friendly. We'll be back again"}
{"text":"Nice little place, good pizza, but not great.  But the staff was very friendly and attentive.  We'll definitely  be back to try their other selections."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special about this place. Not worth a second visit. It is sad that best moderately priced Italian restaurant is Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The food here is always tasty, and they have great appetizers. The staff is friendly as well.  I have always enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"Our pursuit of truly unforgettable Friday Fish Fry cuisine continues and this time from the comfort of our very own couch.  

The weather was typical March terrible madness yesterday and so we decided to stay in.  I had read a great article that gave props to the fish at Picasso's Pizza, not far from our abode so needless to say, they were on our must try Friday Fish Fry list.  When I called to place our order I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they delivered and I was able to continue to enjoy my Cabin Fever honey bock from New Glarus on the comfort of my couch.  I was told our order would be about 45 minutes and I'm pleased to say it arrived much earlier than that.

I ordered the battered walleye with fries and garlic bread.  My fiancee ordered the battered perch with baked potato.  When I opened the perch I was quite surprised to find only three fairly small pieces.  The menu says a half-pound of perch and I'm not sure where the rest went but our order seemed rather skinny.  I placed both orders in the toaster oven for 5 minutes at 400 each to bring them back to life as they both looked a little cool and lifeless.  After a little warm-up, they were fabulous!

The batter was just right.  Often batters can be bland, this was very tasteful and the fish was fresh and succulent.  The perch got rave reviews as well.  

The fries were pretty forgettable and if I could change anything it would be better fries.  The delivery was prompt, the food was delicious and I'm glad to say this will remain on our Friday Fish Fry list as I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza in a town that is full of pizza joints. The delivery was fast and the driver courteous. I haven't ate at the restaurant yet, but when I picked up a carry out order the staff was very friendly and quick to get my order out."}
{"text":"We got a large pie. She got a couple meats and I got chicken on my half. I sincerely think it was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. I hear they have very good fish but my pizza was so bad I'm not willing to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Super tasty and friendly service!   If you're looking for some good food off the beaten path, stop in here- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Picasso's is a really good restaurant that likely is not as popular as it could be a) because of its location and b) because of the name. It is located in a dirty little strip mall off Verona Road next to a liquor store. The sign makes it look like a crappy carryout pizza place, when in reality the menu is quite extensive and pizza is only the start. The last time I was there I had a ravioli dish with fresh asparagus that was fantastic. Very impressive beer selection. 
Make an effort to go in the summer, as there is seating outdoors that makes you feel like you're out in your own backyard. This place could definitely be more popular but I think part of the appeal is that it is a little hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Hard for me to believe that this so called pizza gets any positive reviews. My son and I ordered a large pizza, for delivery, and it was sincerely the worst pizza we have ever tasted,with no exaggeration, this was the only time ever I had disposed of an entire pizza after one bite. No flavor and a more than bland flour water crust. it was truly embarrassing. We threw away 26 dollars worth of horribleness, and never heard back from them with our dismal opinion. They offered no refund or compromise. The delivery man was extremely unfriendly with no pizza warmer and couldn't wait to run away with his 5 dollar tip, as if he knew how bad it was. I never recommend this place. Picassos is the worst in madison by far. Don't even try it. Way better options for your money."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from the outside, unfortunately.

And don't get parthenon pizza under any circumstances."}
{"text":"From the outside the restaurant looks like a hole in the wall pizza joint.   I was surprised by some of the good reviews on Yelp that said this place had really good food so I finally got over there to check it out.  
When I walked in the door I was really surprised.   Inside it opens up into a nice space with a bar and a fair amount of places to eat. Then they have a large patio area with another bar and that leads to an even larger space with a fire pit.  I love places like this that you would never guess what's behind this door and voila, a whole new world.
To be safe I ordered a basic Pizza called Roman Rule.  They had a good amount of other variety pizzas and other dishes and they also let you create your own pizza if you so wish.  Our \"16 inch\" came to 23 dollars and yes, that is the pizza I am talking about.  We were not disappointed.  When it came we were filled up with yummy goodness.
I have looked for a long time for a pizza place that makes pizza like I used to eat as a kid in my home town and this is the closest I have found to that and it was delicious.  Great flavors, perfectly cooked, delicious cheese, perfectly sliced and tasty tomatoes.   Super good.  Oh, and most importantly, the crust was perfect, crispy, tasty, just like I like.
We will be back to try some of their other pizzas soon and also to tip back a few beers in their hidden little world out back."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars for Picasso's.

I walked in with a friend about 6 on a Saturday night and the place was already pretty full. We asked to be seated and got kind of an annoyed response from the host -but they put us at a table right by the door. At first we thought it was tolerable, but with the revolving front door with a zillion people picking up their take out pizza, we were freezing in minutes. When we asked to be seated somewhere away from the door, we got another look of frustration but they moved us.

Our waiter honestly seemed slightly intoxicated. He was flustered and didn't really seem to be all that prepared to be waiting tables. However, overall I thought he gave us pretty decent service. Our food took ages to come out and he came back a few times to apologize for the wait and ask if we wanted another glass of wine. At the end of the meal, he took a dollar off our drinks for the wait which was very nice.

The food overall was meh - not bad but nothing memorable. I had the garlic chicken pizza and my friend had the mac & cheese pizza. Both were average. Couldn't say I would return."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Picasso's three times and eaten in there once. They make consistently great pizza, and accurately represent delivery times when I place orders for delivery. The Roman Ruler pizza is a favorite of mine, however the cajun cream sauce on the Cajun Comfort didn't really do much for me the one time I ordered it. If you're looking for an excellent family-owned business instead of a chain, start with this one. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was all set to love Picasso's - that little hole in the wall that nobody bothers to try, according to the five-star reviews. Unfortunately, I found the one-stars a little closer to reality.

So yeah, the location. Definitely not ideal, but not so bad, really. Their neighbor is a liquor store, not a crack house.

The ambience is actually pretty nice for the kind of restaurant it turned out to be. At a family-friedly pizza place I'd expect red & white checked vinyl table cloths, you know? Picasso's has muted colors, actual artwork on the walls, and a dimly lit bar.

But then there's the food, which I will sum up in three words: Too Much Cheese. OK, the appetizer was our fault - we ordered the cheese bread. But the salad? Approximately 1/3 shredded cheese. And the lasagna? Approximately 1/2 melted cheese. The spaghetti & meatballs? Also covered in cheese. But cheese is good, right? This is Wisconsin! Well, some cheese is good and some cheese turns to rubber upon chewing. I'm not sure what makes cheese do that, but I know I don't like it.

OK, let's say you love cheese and wouldn't be the least bit put off by the excesses. You might have liked the lasagna - aside from the cheese it was your basic lasagna with noodles, meat and tomato sauce. The presentation was a little weird with a small square in the middle of a large plate, the rest of the plate filled in with sauce and cheese. On the other hand, I really can't say anything good about the meatballs that came with the spaghetti. They smelled like dog food and tasted a little better. Dry, overcooked, barely flavored, hard. Yuck.

And a word of warning: if you don't like the music playing on the patio, make sure you get a table on the left side. On the right side you will hear the music at all times, and you will REALLY hear it every time the patio door opens."}
{"text":"I met my family here after work. We picked it because of the \"good reviews\" it gets. Huh, not really sure why. Ok, actually the calamari was really good, I'll give them that. But that's where it ends. Well fine, the server was really very nice, just not very good.  Wine - unremarkable. I ordered a pizza, bbq chicken. I suppose it's my fault for not reading the menu well enough. I don't really care for thin crust which is all they do - unless you ask for something else. Crust - dry and tasteless. Bbq sauce - too must and overwhelming. Pineapple - canned. Cheese - too much. 

Give me a Pizza Brutta next time!"}
{"text":"I placed and order an hour and a half ago after being told I'd receive my delivery in 45 min.  After I called to inquire the status of my order the dude said his delivery guy didn't show and my food left 8 min ago. 

It'd been nice to have a courtesy call.  It's equivalent to sitting in the restaurant awaiting food to come out.  Customers shouldn't be ignored. Sad to say I don't recommend their delivery method."}
{"text":"Came out to visit my significant other and arrived in the evening, so I was hungry.  He had previously ordered from this pizza place and seemed to like it, so I went with it.  It was a good idea.  We ordered a calzone with fresh tomatoes and garlic for him, and an italian salad and a veggie sandwich for me for delivery.  I was too busy eating my food to sample his, but from the looks of it, the food was thoroughly enjoyed.  The salad was HUGE.  (I'm still working on it).  It's definitely not a puny side salad and not a large salad with wilted lettuce like I've seen some salads as main entrees seen as.  Had lots of lettuce topped with banana peppers, salami, green bell peppers, black olives, tomato slices, and mozzarella cheese on top. There was a choice of dressing which I chose the Italian Ranch dressing.  The veggie sandwich was omg yum! The basil pesto aioli came on the side, which I was happy with (I like dipping my food into sauces).  Quite frankly though, the sandwich is great by itself.  I had completely forgotten about the aioli (probably because I thought it was a spread on the sandwich).  

I will mention that when I called, I didnt realize that it was already 915 pm.  They close at 9pm. When I called, they hesitated and said they close at 9 and I was ready to apologize and end the call when they told me to hold on and that they would speak with manager.  A minute later they got back on and took my order.  Delivery was prompt and the delivery man was friendly, although probably exhausted.  Thanks, Picasso's PIzza for letting us order even though it was past closing!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, reliable food, decent service (always friendly).

This is one of those locally owned places that you find yourself asking \"Why don't I eat here more often?\"  If it has been a while for you, you should head back to Picasso's.

I still think it's the best pizza in town.  Thin cracker style crust, cut in squares, with generous portions.  You won't lose weight eating here, but it makes for a nice, happy night out.  

Their lasagna is outstanding, but it's very rich.  Their specials are always unique and reliable.  I really do like this place.  

Full bar and several beers on tap."}
{"text":"Host various events at our home, and really struggled to find great caterers here in Madison. We used Picassos last night and it was the best experience we've ever had with a caterer. Chad, the owner, stayed and prepared the food the entire night. Things were fresh, and I heard amazing comments from the guests about the food. 

Chad arrived early for set up, helped throw away garbage and recycling during the event, and sort of disappeared quietly after everyone was done eating dessert. He was a true professional. Would highly recommend Picassos to anyone hosting an event,"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's never busy, the food is usually great, and the staff is friendly. In love with the mushroom strudel appetizer ... mmmm."}
{"text":"I haven't always had perfect experiences at Picasso's. My family goes here occasionally and service historically has always been somewhat slow but the food is just so amazing that we keep coming back. But I took my boyfriend here the other night and service was absolutely perfect. The food was absolutely incredible and the waiters were very attentive. I had the mushroom fettuccini and we also ordered bruschetta. Both were some of the best flavors I have ever tasted. Everything tastes extremely fresh and prepared to perfection. Although the restaurant has some hiccups, I would highly recommend going (on a week night)."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty fantastic.  We used to live down the road and got it more often than we do now.  I really like the ratio of sauce to cheese (very dense and cheesey).  Their italian sausage is excellent.  Call ahead and carry it out - or eat in, either way, it's an excellent meal that will satisfy!"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here on the patio the night before our wedding. The manager and waitstaff were excellent and the food was delicious. Even now, a year later, people are still talking about the great fun we had.  

We have been here several times since preferring to pick up food rather than dine in and everything is always great here."}
{"text":"We like it. An easy pick up after work. people are friendly. Ranch dressing on the Picasso salad is great. We like the spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"Service is slow, we arrived a bit before 6, got our drinks about 6:15, apps 30 minutes later and got our entrée at about 7. There were maybe 4 groups, with 16 people total.

Pizza is above average - 
My pasta was overcooked and mushy, the Alfredo bland."}
{"text":"Not open on a Monday night when they are suppose to be open, no answer and no explanation posted on their door. I love their pizza so it sure would be nice if they maintained their hours. Guess I'll have to find a new place for pizza. It's really unfortunate!"}
{"text":"After having excellent pizza delivered, we decided to branch out and actually dine in...big mistake.  My husband ordered soup and was asked if he wanted crackers with it.  He said sure and the response was \"we don't usually serve them, but I will see if I can find some in the basement.\"  Wow not very appetizing to hear the crackers are in the basement and even worse, they tasted like they were 20 years old.  All food was lukewarm, service was awful, had to remind our server of different things we ordered and did not receive.  Spotted Cow on tap was flat and tasted old also.  We will stick to the pizza delivery from now on and skip the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you this place has outstanding food. I have been there several times and have never been disappointed."}
