{"text":"Food poisoning is the worse I will NEVER eat there again! This place should get NO STAR'S  it won't continue without adding star."}
{"text":"Ordered the salsita  bowl with Red Chile as the choice for meat... For the price it was good portion size and the red chili was actually pretty tasty. They didn't have paper towels in the bathroom they just had napkins like the ones that you eat with. The lady at the register was very friendly though. It reminded me eating at my grandma's house after I ordered went to the bathroom and came out the friendly woman was bringing me my food in the bowl with no tray... Just like at grandma's house. Definitely going to be stopping back by over here to try out there other food items"}
{"text":"Not too bad for fast mexican food. I am a connoisseur of cheap fast mexican food and this place does a pretty good job. Nachos were OK but the Carne as ads quesadilla was solid."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise and borderline 5 - Stars if my review was based purely on value then this place would have hit the next plateau. Food was fresh service was quick and attentive, probably not a destination type restaurant that you would drive across town for but if you find yourself in the area definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I been to this place for the past two years, almost go there once a week.  Great food and good portion.  I enjoy the food there very much.  Few week ago I visit this place again, the food still great but the quantity of food is a lot less.  I ordered the two meat combo plate with pork skin and green chili.  The food tastes good, but We only got 2 pieces of pork skin and 5 pieces of pork green chili...that looks like an half order or a kid meal?!  Today, I went back there for snacks, and noticed all the price goes up crazy, we just end up heading back home.  So bad, we like the food at this place so much, but I guess we can't afford to go there as often as before."}
{"text":"Love their tortas! They toast their bread so they're not soggy like most places. They also use a good amount of avacado and their prices are low.  They kinda of take a long time to prep the tortas tho. I only order from the drive-thru so I haven't been inside but it looks pretty clean from the outside."}
{"text":"Salsita's (I think that is the name on the front sign) serves what I call authentic Mexico City food.  The problem is that the restaurant doesn't smell very good, it looks and feels run down and dirty, and I have to confess to a certain amount of squeamishness about eating there.  On the night I visited with my son, they were experiencing a moment of overload, and my order of chicken soup was accidentally served as beef soup.  I felt compassion for the overload, so I didn't ask for a correction of the order.  As Mexico City food goes, it was tasty.  I went here on a recommendation, but I would much prefer Huauchinango's in Mesa, El Amigo at 19th Ave and Peoria, or even Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I love mexican food and looked forward to eating here. The food left much for imagination. Was really disappointed. Won't be going back and won't recommend. We had cheese enchiladas, steak burritos, and carnitas tacos. When ordering the lady originally rung it up incorrectly."}
{"text":"In terms of all the endearingly sketchy looking drive Mexican places we have in the Phoenix area, this one is one of my favorites. I love the pastor and carne asada tacos! The tortillas are always super fresh and the carne is the real stuff, not the stuff that seems sort of like hamburger that I would say the majority of other places like this serve. In fairness I have not explored much of the menu because I'm quite happy with the tacos, so I have stuck with those, but I will definitely try a breakfast burrito some day (they are available all day)."}
{"text":"First off.. their tacos are really good! Their corn tortillas are hand made and the lady that is usually here, is super friendly. But today I called the number provided on this site, and asked how much the tacos were because I was trying to compare prices. He said that each carne asada taco is 1.49. I come in,  order and they are actually 1.65! I explained that I had called and was told different.  No matter what I said,  they would not match the price from which I was told by the 'owner'. I personally don't think this was dealt with properly.. but oh well!"}
{"text":"I was just looking at the pictures I took when I was here last year and realized I had never gotten my review written.  I was just driving by and spotted this place and decided to try it out.  I was impressed there were mostly Latinos in there, in fact everyone but me, so I figured the food must be good.  I mainly went in for seafood and the Ceviche tostada I got was excellent.  But it was a cold day so I got a bowl of Caldo de Res, which I had never had before, and it was sooo good.  Perfect!  I left satisfied and with a warm tummy. I hope it's still there when I come back so I can eat there again!  September 29, 2012:   I'm back in town and returned here late this evening.  I stand by my original review and opinions.  The girl behind the counter was extremely nice, the place smelled wonderful and the food was delicious.  There was not a thing wrong with the entire experience.  I had no gastronomic problems after.  I recommend this place with no hesitation.    I got a Ceviche Tostada because I remembered how good it was last time and it didn't disappoint.  I made a last minute decision to get the huge Chile Relleno on display and it may have been the best one I've ever had in 30 years of enjoying them.  I mean, what more do we want?  Great food, clean, Mexican band blaring.  It was so good I didn't even have any leftovers."}
{"text":"Wow. Legit food. Had the breakfast burrito with egg meat fried potatoes. Beans and rice. They have all the complimentary  sides like sals, cucumber, cabbage, and radish. This is not a fancy place. But I felt like I was in a legitimate mexican restaurant. You order then go sit and they bring to you."}
{"text":"Great fast Mexican food. They have a steam table sat up and you can choose your own ingredients. Their drive through speaker has been broken for over a year which is annoying!  But I really love their quality."}
{"text":"After looking at the photos and remembering trying them 8-10 years (a decade ago?)earlier, I thought it might be a good option to try them again, after all of these years!  All of the main proteins (Chile Verde, Colorado, Barbacoa....they had a big selection!)  you selected first, then any extras or side dishes.  I just pointed to the Chile Verde or \"Green Chile Pork\" and Spanish Rice for $1.99 or $1.49 for a medium-sized to go container!  The price was right and although the meat and sauce was a \"bit\" salty, I just introduced it to a low-sodium rice dish (with more fresh veggies) that was made previously, which complimented El Salsitas offerings!  I'll be back for sure as I think might next stop may include the \"massive\" Chile Relleno! Very helpful employees on Saturday late afternoon!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-through and ordered a torta de milanesa de res. The service was quick and the food was pretty good. Definitely nothing special, and prices were higher than other places, with smaller portions, thus the lower rating."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this place.  The food is kept buffet style so the flies can land on it.  Not made to order.  Small portions and the food was salty.  Why?  Horchata and the customer service was good, but that's about it.    I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Salty. Greasy. Gross. Cold. Meats are not cooked to order.. they're kept hot like a buffet.. a not very good buffet. Ordered a whole bunch of different items to share, and it all pretty much sucked. The Shrimp tacos would have been really awesome had they not had like.. 9919191829291019292919229mgs of sodium.  You're better off at any of the \"to's\""}
{"text":"Bland. Old. Cold.  Pros Nothing. It's literally taking me time trying to come up with something positive to say here.   Cons A lot of food was out buffet style and it looked old and reheated. The food and salsa was bland. Why would a place like this not have made to order hot fresh food? The menu was hard to read, change the font and overall style of it. About 60% of the tables had dirty plates on them. When we left there were still dirty and no it wasn't busy. If the front of the house is unkept, I can't even image what their back looks like.  Overall I would be willing to give them another try but I'm honestly scared of getting food poisoning. There is a lot of food out and I doubt they throw it all away every night. Also, why don't I just go to a place that serves me fresh food?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Please do not come here. We weren't even able to eat due to lack of service. We waited in drive thru line for 20 minutes and no help. When i finally went inside nobody greeted me and I stood In front of the cash register for five minutes while employees walked by and not One greeted me or said a word. Finally left and went and ate somewhere else were the food is better."}
