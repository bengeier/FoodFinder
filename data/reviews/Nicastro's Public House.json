{"text":"Disgusted by the sexist and cowardly management and subpar food. Husband had on a shirt with no sleeves, not a \"wife beater\" as stated by our waitress who was wearing a skimpy tank top, and was offered a shirt to put on.  He had a hoodie with him but when I pointed out how sexist it was she seemed bewildered and only asked him to put it on after we'd ordered and her manager came by.  This is not a high class place and I was the only female aside from the waitress.  It was 4 pm on a Monday.  I don't think anyone really cared.  When asked where the dress code was posted she just shook her shoulders. Asked to talk to Manger but he was too busy on the phone (ya right) working his other job as a realtor and didn't  care to talk to us after asking twice.  Will never go back and will tell everyone I know not to frequent the place. In addition as we were leaving the waitress asked if we wanted our pizza packed up but bothered to point out they don't do that when they have specials. Her tip went down really quick right there. We had never been there before and didn't even know it was  special...as if we were trying to scam them.  Never ever again.  Pizza was terrible too."}
{"text":"It has a really nice set up.. The owner really took care of it .. But the service is kinda crappy. Drinks are average price and the food is okay. If your on centre street there's definitely better"}
{"text":"Have been to Nicastro's twice. 

What I like about it, is that it is 'clean' (I find some older pubs to be pretty grimy), the food is good, and the service is very friendly. I appreciate that you can get a good meal without paying ridiculous prices and the wait staff are not dressed like hookers. 

There are lots of TVs, but it doesn't feel like they have taken over. We took friends on our second visit and they said they enjoyed it too.

If you are in the neighbourhood, stop by and have a beverage and a bite. Relax, you are in good hands."}
{"text":"Went here for my best friends birthday on Saturday the 23rd was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, slow service ran out of there special and didn't advise until after finishing out appies, tried to ask for another drink and was told no she needed to go drop drinks off first before taking more orders. 5 people at our table and 3 of us finished out appies and main before the other 2 even had there appies we all ordered at the same time. This was my first and will be my only time coming here"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, the first time was a month after it first open and the food was really good.  The second time was a couple of weeks ago and the food was average, however the dish I had was even worse, it was the sausage skillet.  The sausage skillet I thought would be a full meal as it was labeled under, \"Mains\".  When it came out, it was two sausages, two pieces of focaccia bread, and marinara sauce, all for overpriced value meal of $14.  I ordered the potato skins to fill the hungry void left by the sausages, and they were decent, but not worth $14 for potato skins.  The service was good, the beer somewhat cold and decently priced.  For me, a pub has to have good food, otherwise there are too many better options to hit up."}
{"text":"Food was decent, had heard alot about the place so had somewhat highhopes. decent atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside. Great service . food is pricey but good . I am a regular and keep going back as they try hard to keep me happy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regular patrons of Nicastro's and we always share the same booth. It feels like Friends, how they always get their preferred seat - we do too! That isn't to say the place is dead, far from it. We usually have the same server and she is always really wonderful. One night when we went, I was starving, and we got our food order within a few minutes. I guess it pays to be a regular because I felt like we got extra special treatment and I really appreciated it. I love the daily specials, we like to go on Wednesdays for wings. Their wings are always gigantic and perfectly cooked - I have no complaints! My boyfriend and I usually split 15 wings and a basket of fries and are both stuffed. I also am a big fan of the caesars they make, they are spicy and have a great rim of salt and they garnish it with spicy pickled asparagus. Each booth has a tv, so if there is a game I want to watch, they will always accommodate me. Friendly servers, great food and great service. The only thing I wish for is for them to bring back the deep fried pickles!! The menu is not the same without them."}
{"text":"This place started off great! The parking lot had several spaces and the concrete parkade floor leading to the entrance had little debris. We were welcomed by large wooden doors that enticed a firm grip to classic brass handles that bore foreshadowing of great food and drinks were at hand. Sadly at this time we were informed by a sign written poorly by an Italian Canadian that the establishment had recently closed. My wife and I were forced to eat a nearby blind child, who may have had bigger eyes than his stomach. After washing that down with the fermented urine that glistened under the parkade ceilings we ended our dining experience by shaving each other under the moonlight. I hope Nicastros brings their business to current standards."}
{"text":"Well, we went on a Sunday night with friends at 5:30pm. Ordered food right away. We should have known better when the place was almost empty except a family party upstairs. Our server was nice but seemed not that interested in us. At 45 mins after ordering we asked if our food was coming... She didn't look or bother finding out, just said, \"yup, it's coming.\" We waited another 10 minutes, asked again, she said, \"yup, 2 minutes.\" Not - I'm really sorry guys, let me go check for you.... Nope. I'm all for giving the benefit of the doubt but there were only 2 other tables and I didn't feel like we mattered at all. So about 1 hour after we sat down and ordered a bowl of soup, a salad, a couple of sandwiches and poutine... The soup comes out and was fridge cold with a bit of warm on the edge. The chicken sandwich also cold, barely warmed, no grill marks. Cold burger too. We waited an hour for cold, barely microwaved soup? No thanks. We paid for our drinks and left. Our waitress did call over the manager, but no explanations or anything. We used to really like this place but since the menu changed  and prices went up the quality and service went way down. Never going back again. And that says a lot because I'm a very forgiving person and acknowledges  that everyone has a bad day now and then. Even if the waitress had said something like they were catering a party upstairs and if the food came out hot, I would have been happy to stay, but this was not the case. There's a way better pub just down the street that served us way better with excellent food. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I never really travel to this part of Calgary because it is quite far from my house, so I don't know the area really well. This is a watering hole for my Calgary friends and now I know why!

The inside of this place is actually really nice. I was here for a surprise party on Saturday and we were upstairs in a private room. The place was nicely decorated! The bartender was really sweet and social with everyone. It ended up being a really cute little party. The food came out really quickly and it was really really good. I liked the pizza/flatbread that they served there.

The upstairs area doesn't have all the liquor available however, so we couldn't get shots like burt reynolds etc. It wasn't too big of an issue though. 

The bathrooms were really clean as well. It was nice that there were private bathrooms for the upstairs people. 

Staff is really nice and helpful! Manager came and introduced himself to us at the end of the night!"}
{"text":"I haven't actually had any food here but the beer was cold and tasty and the service from the bartender Kat was welcoming. She had a witty sense of humor and welcomed us with a shot. Great start to a Friday"}
{"text":"Nicastro's used to be located on Edmonton Trail and has re-opened on Centre St, even closer to my house than it was before, which makes me happy.  This building used to be an Italian restaurant.  I went to the grand opening in Nov 2013 with a group of friends and it's just as great of a neighborhood pub as it used to be, but modernized.  

We were here on a cold night and it felt like a nice place for comfort food.  My pint was a reasonable price and I ate the Papa Nicastro Calzone.  It was slightly overdone on one side but I was happy that it had a lot of filling and flavor.  The only bit I left behind was an edge, which was just a tad too much dough with no filling left.  

We sat on the upper floor and even though it was very busy, service was respectable, it wasn't excruciatingly loud and the overall vibe was great.  The owner did a nice job with the restroom upgrades as well.  

I haven't had a chance to go back yet, but it's the plan.  They do take bookings for private parties and meetings, which I'd recommend to anyone based on my experience so far and the convenience of the location.  There is a parking lot but don't be surprised if you have to park on the side street.  I drive past Nicastro's a lot and it appears to be busy often."}
{"text":"They used to have the most amazing mussels in either a white wine or spicy tomato sauce but they took it off the menu this year. Other than that, I find the menu somewhat stuck between Italian and pub food. The sign has posted that there will be a new menu soon and I am holding my breath hoping for the mussels to come back but I have a bad feeling the new menu is the one that removed the mussels. It's got a nice atmosphere and it's a fun place to come for a drink and some dinner, but it's missing the \"je ne sais quois\" that makes it a classic neighbourhood joint. That being said, I do like the place and I will keep going back! I just hope the new menu brings some harmony."}
{"text":"Another fantastic night at nicastros.  The staff and food is so good.  I find this place clean and the girls so friendly and fun. Even the local regulars where a hoot !"}
{"text":"\"Welcome to the Castro,\" my server told me with a smile. This was in response to while paying my bill I said how much I was enjoying the place.
Look for the fedora tipped casually over the letter N out front. Or better yet, look for the actual hat behind the bar next to the picture of the Castro himself.

I wished I lived closer to this place. There is an up and a main floor section, we sat on the main floor, which is a pub atmosphere. Upstairs was closed for a private function.
My friends and I shared an order of the calamari and we all commented on its deliciousness. Then I was so happy as there was PIZZA on the menu, so ordered a vegetarian pizza (10\") which was so good! Let me preface I ate this entirely by myself, but two low slices remained. 

Defeated by a pizza!

They have a good selection of beers on tap including Village Brewery. I also found the prices to be reasonable for the quality.

I am definitely a fan of the Castro."}
{"text":"Update....My fav server Kat...had told me she would see about getting some Vegan burger patties on the menu. After I explained there was not a lot on the menu I could eat and when going to a pub would love PUB food like a burger.

Went back last night for beers and she came right over and said she had PERSONALLY gone out and bought a package of Vegan patties to keep in the freezer for when I wanted a burger!

How is the for the BEST SERVER ever!!!!


update: Went back to order my Vegan burger and no one knew anything about patties in the back...there was none..have not returned"}
