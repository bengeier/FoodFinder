{"text":"Awesome! We had the Texas pesto shrimp at a friend's house from here Friday night. It was so good I went to their store saturday and picked up 3 meals for this week to try. Great idea for dinners!! Oh and the pumpkin cookies were amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We order at least once a month to stock our freezer.  The main menu changes monthly to offer a variety.  We have been able to try many different recipes that I would have never taken the time to prep.  This is a great solution for variety and time management!"}
{"text":"I've never encountered a place like this before. They have excellent home cooked style meals ready to go. The Brunswick Stew is amazing! I wish there was one of these in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Obsessed.  

I am officially obsessed with Switchin Kitchens.  It is an absolute GEM.  I LOVE this place.  I repeat, I LOVE this place.  

We discovered the magic of SK when a friend brought over sweet potato enchiladas (A MUST TRY!) from the SK \"Take and Bake\" menu.  We were just home from the hospital with our newborn and were enjoying waves of meals from neighbors and friends.  As our darling daughter grew and friends delivering meals slowed to a halt, I knew that I needed to find a solution to feed my family that was easy, healthy, fresh, and REAL food.  (We ate a lot of take-out during my pregnancy and that just wasn't going to be a realistic solution for my new years resolution: Operation Blast the Baby Jelly Belly.

SK offers a HUGE range of fresh entrees, sides, appetizers, and \"fun foods.\"  Nutritional information is available and you can order online and pick up later.  I prefer to have the chefs at SK assemble my meals, but of course, you can book in and go assemble meals yourself!  That way you can alter the meals in any way you'd like (i.e. no mushrooms?  less salt?  More salt?)  There's also a stockpile in their freezers you can go and choose from.  I popped in on Christmas eve and picked up a yummy meatball app to nosh on Christmas day!   Also, meals are affordable, generous portions (for a family of 3 eaters, we do the 1/2 portions and it's more than enough!)

The main entree menu changes monthly, but there are take and bake entrees that are standard every month.  I believe the sides and vegetarian entrees stay the same for the most part as well?  

Favorites so far: Sweet potato enchiladas, Fiesta Bake, Tuscan Chicken, Chicken Cakes, Crock Pot Carnitas, Thai chicken with snow peas, oh....too many to list.  Also, be sure to check out the \"fun foods\" section.  Awesome for kids.  My 2.5 yo loves cheeseburger pie with pickles!  

Our new process is to order every week or so.  We order online - enough for the week - and pick it up a day or 2 later.  Bring them home, pop them in the freezer, and BAM...a healthy fresh new and exciting meal NIGHTLY!  It's a LIFESAVER for us (I love to cook but don't have the time, and frankly am not very creative in the kitchen unless I put in a huge effort.  Now we're eating healthy delicious real food meals nightly!!!  No more take-out or processed foods for this family!!!!

Have I mentioned I'm obsessed??!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  An awesome selection of main courses, appetizers, desserts, veggie dishes and more ready to go.  This is a kitchen that prepares and packages quite an impressive menu of items, freezes them and has them ready to go.  Depending on the meal or item it might take 45 minutes or so to heat up and serve.

How wonderfully convenient!  And the meals I have had are delicious.  Such a surprise as my wife brought egg plant Parmesan for dinner.  I was hesitant, but after a fork-full was full of questions about where they came from.

Went with her and a visiting cousin last night to check out the place myself and left impressed and with over $30 of purchases.  

Their set-up is a very immaculate kitchen, freezers with inventory lists that they continually update and several printed menus.  There is a group of items in acetate at the counter of items that they \"always have\" on-hand.  Those pages cover the waterfront offering a good selection, to include vegetarian items...and lots of them.

They also have a printout for special occasions and monthly specials.  The monthly specials join the always have items. The other menu items are available on-order.  Especially good if you are giving a dinner party or catering some event.

Prices very reasonable and the individual portions are reasonable.  Other than individual portions are packages for 2 - 3 persons and then 4 - 6 people.  So you don't have to buy more than you want to consume in a short period.

Very friendly and we will be enjoying their menus going forward.  We are fans, for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick dinner to make at the house. We ordered Shepherds Pie and found that there are a lot more potatoes instead of meat, veggies, and gravy. We also tried to the Brunswick Stew which was very tasty and on point for what we like. I'll return and try some other items. You can't beat the convenience either way."}
{"text":"My friend hosted a birthday party and had the Sweet Potato Enchiladas amongst the fare, and I have been obsessed with them ever since. Just buy them, lots of them and top them with sour cream and/or salsa if you want to live dangerously. Also get the Cheeseburger casserole with pickles. You will not be disappointed."}
