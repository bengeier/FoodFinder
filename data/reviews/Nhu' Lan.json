{"text":"This place has the best Banh Mi and Vietnamese desserts in the area! Their specialty is Banh Bao (steam pork bun)! Seriously can't leave the place without picking up 5 of these at a time. Also they have lots of authentic Vietnamese drinks, which I love. Everything is made fresh in the back and the staff are super friendly. It's a must go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Don't let the storefront keep you away!!!  Walk inside and get the best sandwich & assorted Vietnamese appetizers... Love the friendly / family staff, they cater to your requests and make everything from scratch in the back kitchen. Cant wait to be back."}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese but my friend is, and assures me the banh mi here is legit.  The bread is softer than other places and the \"stuffing\" kinda scarce.  This is the only place I know of that adds soy sauce or fried ginger & onions.   Different... in a good way. I'd come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The shop is kind of small and there isn't really much room to explore or walk around. They sell drinks, vietnamese deserts and vietnamese subs. The subs use to be cheaper but they got like $1 something more expensive. The subs taste pretty good and I like to put some soy sauce in as well. I'm not sure if they have a vegetarian sub but for those allergic to nuts, its probably not safe to eat here because some of the desserts have nuts in them so there might have been some cross contamination. The price is kinda expensive I think because I know how much it was back then. It under $5 right now but still I wouldn't want to buy it anymore unless they lower the price back to its original price. The banana desert is pretty good. It on par I think with my moms which is authentic because she grew up in Vietnam as well. As gor the drinks, there are some vietnamese drinks and pop like Sprite. The drinks are cold because they are in some like refrigerator and I'm not sure about the price because I never really buy them. The lady there can speak viet but I'm not sure if she is good with english because my mom orders in viet."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Vietnamese sandwiches, and this place makes some of the best! The spicy one is my favorite :)   The only cost $2.25 each sandwich, they are big and filling, plus they are loaded with lots of veggies.   I defiantly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I live about a 5 minute walk from here and a 2 minute drive (literally!) but they sell one of the best Vietnamese subs \"banh mi\" I've ever tried in my entire life. My mom comes here A LOT and that's how I found out about it and now I come here sometimes with my boyfriend. They sell a lot of Vietnamese drinks and foods but I usually just come for the banh mi.  I am Vietnamese so I do eat banh mi a lot and I love the banh mi thap cam \"assorted meat\" and it's one of the popular choices. It's also VERY AFFORDABLE, literally $3.25 for the assorted meat banh mi. They also sell Vietnamese iced coffee and I do get it sometimes but not the best I've tried. Still good but I prefer another place.  They only accept cash (downside) and they close at 7pm (also a downside). But you cannot beat the banh mi here especially for the taste and the price. Their meat is also fresh and made to order. I SERIOUSLY LOVE THE BUTTEE AND PATE IN THE BANH MI! I had two today already (the day I wrote this review) lol."}
{"text":"I came here since I was passing by and I wanted to pick up a banh mi. I generally visit another mainstream chain for banh mi, but since this was closeby, I decided to give this local joint a try. I ordered the assorted banh mi and it was made quickly. The shop have other vietnamese foods that are prepared already.   When I opened the banh mi, I realized there wasn't much filling. Although they give you 4-5 pieces of deli meats like other joints, the slices here are a lot smaller. The banh mi isn't bad, but for $3.25 (which is comparable to other joints), I expected the quantity to be similar to other joints. I felt like there wasn't much stuffing and they can definitely cut bigger slices. I probably won't return since I wasn't satisfied with the portion."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite banh mi place to go :) The food there is delicious and the staff members are always so helping and kind. Prices are also very reasonable. 11/10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Legitimate Banh Mi that satisfies a craving. I'm not Vietnamese, but I've had enough experience with these delicious sandwiches that I can recognize what's authentic. For an example, they use pate, vietnamese ham, cilantro, and add spicy with green chiles. However, I love daikon in my sub but they only have the carrot pickle.  Subs are a little smaller than a footlong, a little larger than the regular banh mi. However, the filling is on the scanty side, although that's not too surprising when most of the subs are $3.  They also have buns, snacks, drinks (not sure what exactly, and salad rolls. I love salad rolls, and these were good and FRESH. Made with mint (so important for salad rolls!) and the wrapper was still soft. I got 3 for $4, with a bbq pork filling as well as shrimp."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamse 'bánh mì\" in North York area. Bánh mì and all ingredients are fresh, prepared on the spot, in this nice little store. My fav bánh mì gà; thâp câm also a popular choice. Very reasonable price. Not to mention very sweet and friendly staff. Highly recommend.!!!!!!!!!! Yummmyyyy bánh mì!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"2017-09-04. I've been coming here for years for the Banh Mi. Sadly, I must say that I've sunken with the ship and it's time for me to swim to shore; the only problem is that there's no shore for miles and miles...  I remember when prices were just $1. Then it went up to $1.25, then $1.50 shortly after. The increase moved rapidly as inflation and wages both rose. Pretty soon we were at $2.00, then $2.50, and now $3.25. Grant it, it's been over a decade, and it's understandable. What's not understandable is the double whammy. While prices rose steadily, quality also degraded. Fewer slices of meats, thinner slices of meat, the elimination of the pickled daikon radish, less pate, and the list goes on. It's at a point now whereby you order the extra meat for $1, and you pretty much get the Banh Mi you paid $1 and $2 for back in the day.  The Vietnamese bread is my absolute favourite, it's a take on the French Baguette, but I like it much more. A thin, crisp outer crust with a super soft inner. It's great with soups, sandwiches, stews, or simply toasted with some garlic butter and cheese. But sadly, the sandwich itself has degraded to the point where it's way off proportion-wise. The ratio of vegetables, to meat, to starch is not even close to any kind of balance. The dryness from the bread is way to prominent in every bite. The pickled carrots provide moisture, but it's tartness overpowers the proteins. The taste of the pate fades as you move on down the sandwich (or up depending on which end you eat first). All sad signs that the ship has sunk.  The increase in price in conjunction with the decrease in quality is just to big a double whammy IMO. There are places not too far from here in every direction except north, I'll just have to start giving them a try. 2 stars.  If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
