{"text":"We made a quick stop on our way to New York from the airport. Much nicer inside than I pictured. We had a quick dinner while other diners were enjoying a more leisurely pace. Great they could accommodate both speeds! Enjoyed the pizza."}
{"text":"Great place that serves fantastic Italian cuisine. Always offer great lunch specials and tasty desserts. If you want something a little greasier, try their \"cowboy\" sub, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Très bonne adresse si vous aimez italien  Peut-être un peu trop de sauce mais certainement dû à la situation géographique. Un excellent verre de cabernet-sauvignon pour accompagner N'hésitez pas à vous laisser tenter"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm happy to have found this place on yelp prior to our stay!   Service was very friendly, the atmosphere was really nice, I felt like we might have been underdressed but it wasn't a issue!   Our food was excellent. I enjoyed the bread that was served prior to our meal, there was a tomato pizza like garlic bread and a classic garlic. I enjoyed the tomato one the best, it was unique and enjoyable. We both got a cream based pasta, I got the carbonara with chicken and the husband went with his usual alfredo with chicken. My only complaint of the whole meal and experience was that the chicken was a bit dry and a little odd tasting. The pasta made up for it! It was the best pasta we have had! Very creamy, rich and filling.   Yum! I will return some day."}
{"text":"Ma première visite à ce restaurant avec des amis qui connaissent l'endroit. Premièrement , la devanture n'est pas attirante donc ne pas s'y fier. Le stationnement est très facile et il est très facile de s'y rendre. La table d'hôte est disponible à partir de 15$ ce samedi soir incluant soupe ou salade verte avec cafe. Nous étions 6 et tout fut parfait sauf que j'aurais apprécier un meilleur choix de vins blancs malgré que je suis concient que ce n' est pas la force des Italiens. Pour ma part j'ai bien aimé le plat de rotolo farci au poulet et fines herbes.La sauce tomate trs simple mais delicieuse. Quand la base de sauce tomate est bonne comme celle ci, habituellement, le reste du menu sera a la hauteur.  Ma compagne elle a adoré sont linguini pescatore.Belle quantité de crevettes, moules calamares et petoncles. La salade verte en entrée sur la table d'hôte etait très ordinaire. A ce restaurant si vous commander un plat de pâtes vous en rapporterez sûrement a la maison puisque les assiettes sont énormes. Le restaurant est petit et assez bruillant. Le service fut impeccable , efficace. J'y retourne bientôt."}
{"text":"Some colleagues recommended this restaurant near the Montreal airport during my business trip, and I'm really happy that I took their recommendation. The restaurant is in a strip mall, but the interior aesthetically comfortable and warm. The food arrived in large portions, easily enough for another meal or to split with another person. The service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  The restaurant specializes in veal, and I will have to say it perhaps was the best veal dish I've ever experienced. I enjoyed two veal cutlets covered in a cream sauce and served with a side of spaghetti. Given how incredible the veal was, I will have to say that I was disappointed with the spaghetti and especially the red sauce. It was very average - as in Chef Boyardee average. If you're having the spaghetti side, I recommend another sauce other than the red. Other than this \"side\" issue, the meal was memorable and the service attentive. C'est bon."}
{"text":"Drove all the way hear only to find out it was closed at 9pm vs the 10pm closing time on yelp and google. Not happy about that especially as I was in the city for a day and riding uber around."}
{"text":"Update: the owner of DaMangione,  Frank,  seems to be a good guy and has offered to set things straight.  I have not had the chance to take him up on it because things have been busy.  Thanks Frank.  Paid for a $75 gift certificate for my Dad's birthday. A few months later, my Dad passes away and my Mum returns the gift certificate to me. Perfect, ordering takeout will remove some of the overhead while things are busy... I order a pizza and mention that I'll be paying with a gift certificate and they tell me that I will not be getting any change on my $75 gift certificate.  \"No problem, just give me a smaller gift cert\", I say.  \"No that's not the way it works\", she says.  \"normally we don't even take gift certificates for take out.  We're just making an exception\".  Ridiculous, expecting me to pay $75 for a pizza and I do not understand the distinction between a takeout order and eating in the restaurant.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"Super close to the airport, which allowed me to safely eat with my family before flying out. The food overall was flavorful and well priced."}
{"text":"I love this little place. It's small, quiet with personal attention. The food is excellent and the staff is great too!  I recommend the lasagne!"}
