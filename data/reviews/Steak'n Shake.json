{"text":"I been waiting in there drive threw now for 20 min. This is crazy I'm 9 months pregnant an hungry never coming back an I hope the food is good. I order a shake I'm sure it's nasty by now. Still sitting here waiting 30min later an he handed me a melted shake. Then had an attitude."}
{"text":"It's too bad I like their food, because tonight was the last time I'll ever go here.  I got here at around 10:30p, the place was a little busy, more than I expected for time, but I was seated quickly, despite the fact that no effort was made to clean the dried strawberry rings off the table.  I ordered a burger and a banana shake, and was quickly brought a glass of water, no utensils, no napkins (but who needs a napkin when eating a burger?).  Fast forward 40 minutes when my burger arrived.  It tasted ok, as good as any other time I've been to a franchise and was served within 10 minutes of placing my order.  After I finished eating, I sat waiting for the waitress to bring the check to see if she had charged me for the banana shake I never received.  After another 15 minutes I was brought the check, and as I'm walking to the register the another waitress comes at me with a melted banana shake.  I refused, paid my tab, and left, never to return.  It was the first time in my life I've left $0 for a tip."}
{"text":"Drive-thru for a #2 dashboard burger and fries. Service was quick. Burger was all-the-way good. Fries excellent. I have eaten chili inside several times, also excellent."}
{"text":"The worst! All the staff (manager included) were just standing around talking, the floors were so slick and dirty it was hard to walk, and the bathroom was horrible. And to add a cherry on top the health score was a 92.... avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to steak and shake in over 5 years. Me and a friend decided to stop in for something to eat and were immediately seated and our waiter was very fast and checked up on us frequently. The food was fresh and tasted great. Also the prices can not be beat! I was very pleased with our service and will go back soon! Charlie our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"I only give it one start because that is the minimum you can give.

Don't waste your time, waited 30 min to be seated when the restaurant wasn't even half full. Finally just walked out, they had space to sit my family but choose not to. Tables were not cleared and employees standing around doing nothing.

I don't know if it's just me or what but when you are at work you should actually be working not on your phone."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best burger joints in South Charlotte!  I've never had a problem with my orders here and the staff is great.  They make a awesome Royale Steakburger and my wife is in love with their Salt & Vinegar fries!"}
{"text":"This is a really good Steak n Shake. Great service and good food. Gets busy at lunch but worth it."}
{"text":"This place was not clean. There was food all over the floor, in t he corners and on tables. The burgers, kiddy meals, fries were all served hot. The server was sweet but slow. The kitchen was slow. The restaurant was nearly empty.  The shakes came out after the meals were done.  But worst of the worst - I killed a roach climbing on the wall adjacent to the table. YUCK! When I showed it to the server, she apologized and stuffed the napkin with dead roach into her apron pocket and left to wait on another table. Now I know why they were almost empty. Disgraceful. Not even an offer of a discount. But I do not intend to go back there anytime soon. Terrible"}
{"text":"The customer service starting at try front register is HORRIBLE. No eye contact No acknowledgment of a guest, No Thank You NOTHING. I had to stand there and stare at the cashier as she had her head down the entire time I approached after about two minutes I turned to my daughter and said \"what are you having\" once my daughter answered me the cashier replied and said \"is that all\".
I'm like \"What, I didn't even order I didn't know you were ready\". She replied \"Ooh well is that all?\" 
I like to walked out because I can't deal with rude people who work in the service industry taking a job from a willing and able person who would LOVE to work and have a income. 
The ONLY reason I stayed is because my teenager had been stressing me about a shake ALL DAY and I took her to fulfill her craving since I don't take her for dessert often as its not healthy.

I WILL NOT return here hopefully there is another place that I can convince her to like the shake at because this is our 2nd visit to this place and both times were VERY UNWELCOMING & RUDE and did I mention SLOW."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, the shakes are, well, alright, though I like the Cookout shakes much more, but the downfall of this joint seems to be the service. Maybe not at all times, but the last time I was there, the food took extra long to arrive, the server was slow and didn't bother getting us refills...it was just a terrible experience. I'll still be going back, but I'll do pick-up window if it ever happens to be late at night again."}
{"text":"Nope, not a fan.

Perhaps I set myself up because when I went I was starving and looking to try something new...but this place didn't hit the spot for me at all.

I decided to do drive thru and went with the Chicago hot dog meal which comes with fries and I added a chocolate milkshake. Well I had to keep repeating my order to the drive thru attendant,  for whatever reason just could get it right...finally when he repeated back what I actually wanted and the wait to get to the widow began. I waited and waited to get to the window. 

When I finally got up there he handed me my milkshake and a footlong hotdog...I told him that that wasn't what I ordered but he insisted that the order was correct, I wasn't in the mood to argue I was too hungry....

The fries are supposed to be like shoestring fries but mine were cold and I didn't care for them at all. I'm a french fry lover so this was very disappointing.

The hot dog came overwhelmed with toppings onions, relish and ketchup...now normally I would be raving about an abundance of toppings but here they ruined the dog! The toppings overshadowed the flavor and made the bread wet...ugh I hate wet, soggy bread! 

The only saving grace and reason for the 2 stars was the milkshake. It was creamy and came topped with whipped cream and a cherry....

Other than that I don't see myself running back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"It was that weird time of day around 3p, where I haven't eaten yet, but I didn't want to eat too much because of dinner. So I thought I would get a hot dog. I went to Steak and Shake, I saw that they had a combo, Chicago style hot dog, french fries and drink for $5. You can't beat that price. So I ordered, it's #16- if you need to get a quick fix. 

It was definitely good, they cut the hot dog in half longways, grill it on the flat top, top it with all the appropriate fixin's for a Chicago dog. My french fries were hot, but shoestring french fries get cold really fast, so they had already been under the heat lamp a few minutes, then by the couple of minutes to park the car- not the best. So my french fry barometer registered a \"a nice tone of meh\" 

The hot dog bun was too large and poofy, so way too much bread and it was sopping wet from pickle juice, so soggy bread is a turn off, and I don't mean damp either. it was smushed wet like a sponge. Yeah, smushed. Also it wasn't a poppy seed bun for the sticklers. Oh, and another thing, they grilled the bun, that was a nice touch.. My hot dog was made with care, not slapped together.. 

So, this being said, for five bucks and a quick dog, yes I will return."}
{"text":"Not sure why people are so obsessed with this place. Spend the extra money and get a burger that's worth it. This place is no better than McDs or Wendy's. Don't get what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Ok, so not many people in their right mind should expect anything from a greasy spoon like Steak and Shake. 

If you're walking in the front doors and expecting a 5-star meal, you might as well expect the same from one of the larger fast food chains in this great country. 

If you choose to experience Steak and Shake, do so on a very empty stomach and then expect to take heartburn medicine and a nap. 

Heavy, greasy, fatty and devoid of a healthy option. Again, quite expected. You might as well just walk in knowing that you're going to have to loosen your belt. 

With that being said, you have to get a burger, dog, patty melt, whatever with fries. Their fries are so skinny and light. Not overdone like so many other places. 

Also, you have to get a milkshake. What kind of experience would you be having at a truckstop-esque diner without a milkshake? Shame on you if you forego this option!

Look forward to leaving full, disgusted with yourself and ready for a small hibernation!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last Saturday night after movies.  It was very crowded and it looked like they were short staffed -- but waitresses were really very attentive and really trying their best to serve everyone.  Burgers were really good - fries and onion rings were equally delicious.  Looked like their drive thru was really busy.  We'll be back   Good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good ole steak and shake.  What can I say.  I am personally not a fan but my kids love it."}
{"text":"Horribke customer service. This is my favorite and I will never eat here again because of this one location"}
{"text":"This is a great choice if you have young children.  In fact, they eat FREE ALL WEEKEND!  They not only get a hat to wear, but also a very cool car with stickers.  Who else offers that?  There are good coupons and discounts off of the already reasonable prices.  Open 24H.  If you like fresh cooked burgers, hot dogs, and lots of milk shake flavors--this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Everyone who worked there seemed very warm and inviting despite the fact that they were very busy. The restaurant seemed just a little dated but at least it was clean despite the crowd. My waitress was Jaquesha who was very nice and sweet despite my many demands. The food was served very quickly and was very tasty. The price of the food is what I loved as well."}
{"text":"I don't know why I found myself coming back to this location but here I am at midnight after a long day. The shakes are great. I'm currently addicted to number 7 which is a burger with mushrooms.  The fries have been pretty good. It's the wait in the drive thru that will never get them those extra stars from me. Up to 10 minutes..... 
in closing food 5 stars
Drive thru 1 star
Gets you 3 stars"}
{"text":"Steak and shake ... Meals for 4 dollars ... Seriously how can you complain ? Hand dipped milkshakes .... Skinny fries ... Yum"}
{"text":"Fast service, good waiting times, and great food. I will go here again when I visit South Carolina again."}
{"text":"They took forever to give me my order and everything is so dirty, it's my last time here."}
{"text":"Eh, it's a chain sit-down fast food place. Expectations are low, and they're met. In my experience,  the service was decent, the food was just ok (not bad but definitely nothing special) and the place seemed clean. Can't expect much more. Visits here are inspired solely on a need for convenience. Kids meals are free if an adult spends at least $8. And milkshakes are pretty good.  The fries are boring."}
{"text":"It was ok food. I had the trio shooter and I felt like there was more bread than beef.  Way more.   I has the bbq, garlic and ketchup and onion.  The flavors were good.  But very little meat.  

Like the other comments. The wait was a long time. The service was nice but took a long time for the food.  Took a while to be seated or even acknowledged.  At least say something when we walk in the door.   I asked for an extra paper placemat because we were shorted. Never got it.  I asked for 3 straws. Got 2. However the server was polite and you could tell she was trying. 

The food flavors were good. Burgers cooked just right. Of what I could tell.  It was clean. The shakes were the best thing. They were thick and creamy and delicious. They have so many combinations, you have top return just for those. 

I think a good promo would be a shake sampler. There are so many to try. They could offer small cups of different shakes and shake combos.   It would really draw in larger parties."}
{"text":"Got to love Steak and Shake.  Back to the 1930s and still good.

Smushed beef on the grill slid on to great buns in lots of combinations.  And so many meals of burger and fried for under $5.

Fries are like shoe string size, but slightly larger.  So yummy they are a meal in itself.

Shakes are old time.  And I guess at least 25 versions that come in a small kid size and a big old adult size served with whipped cream and a cherry along with the excess in a icy cold metal shake container.

Options are plentiful so you can get what your mood tells you to get.

And very friendly servers who do a lot of moving during their shifts.

Kids love it, also."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow Drive-through service at midnight on Saturday! I'll get back to you if I ever get my food."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Steak'n Shake last week for the first time in years and I was not disappointed. First of all I forgot how cheap it is! We both got the Wisconsin Mushroom Swiss burger with fries ($4). You can now also get regular fries or add Cajan or Parmesan flavoring to them. I got the cajan fries and they were pretty good- but I think I'll stick with the regular next time as it was essentially a cajan salt seasoning they sprinkled on the fries- not tossed or cooked with. 

As far as the burger goes it was awesome! It was cooked perfectly and the bun was soft, yet slightly crispy. I didn't get a milkshake because I didn't have the healthiest lunch, but they have a variety of flavors- including seasonal ones like pumpkin and egg nog so be sure to ask if they have a seasonal one next time you go. 

Lastly, our server was nice and attentive. He made sure our waters were filled and took care of us. 

Next time I'm in the area I'll consider Steak'n Shake again for a guilty, greasy lunch."}
{"text":"Like all others in this chain the food is the same with great milk shakes but the service is extremely slow. This level of food is certainly not worth waiting for almost an hour. How they stay in business is baffling."}
{"text":"I'm shocked. For all the hype around this Crosby, especially with their recent IPO, I assumed it was just another burger joint. But the burgers are actually quite good. They remind of the old fashioned taste I used to get in Texas. Prices are very good, too. I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:25 PM. Waited 20 minutes before we were acknowledged by wait staff. We ordered waters and food at the same time. 10 minutes later the water came out. 20 minutes later our meal came to the table but our shakes didn't. After we finished our food and no napkins to clean up, we were still waiting for our shakes. Shakes finally came out at 11:30 PM but mine was wrong so I'm still waiting for the correct shake to come out and it's 11:50 PM. Maybe I'll get my shake tomorrow lol. Oh and the air conditioner vent keep dripping on us too. 
We called their complaint line while at our table too."}
{"text":"I had a really great Jamaican Jerk Double Burger and fries. The burger was an admirable amount of jerk seasoning, hot and juicy. Fries were hot, crispy and tasty. My only issue preventing a five star rating wast the service, which was just ok. It appeared that a mass hiring had occurred and the predominance of the wait staff was new, and still taking instructions from the person in charge, so much so that I never was provided and silverware, glad it was just burger and fries. Hopefully upon a future visit that all will be resolved with their training and quality service will prevail."}
{"text":"Very crowded, but staff remained courteous. Sat at the bar, which didn't seem very clean. Food took a LONG time to get, but was warned ahead of time by my server.

This is my yearly visit for my Birthday burger & fries...otherwise not a regular place I'd visit or recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Steak and Shake. We were on the road headed back to Maryland from Atlanta and stopped in Charlotte to visit a friend and get a break from driving. There were not many places that were open so we chose Steak and Shake. I ordered classic double cheeseburger meal and a Oreo shake. The shake was amazing! So sweet. It reminding me of a Chick-fil-A shake. The burger was not impressive. Not seasoned and even the toppings weren't helping. The fries were horrible. I didn't even finish them. The staff was nice and the restaurant was very clean. Too bad I didn't like the food. I always heard great things about it."}
{"text":"I was all wrong about my thoughts on Steak'n Shake.  I really thought they were just another fast food, order at the counter type place.  Wrong! It's like a weird little restaurant that feels like a diner, but tastes better than that.

I had the burger that is named Prince something... But it was a burger patty, bacon, cheese and fried egg. It was delicious! It came with skinny fries, the kind that you could eat a bazillion of and never really get full.  I also ordered the Salted Caramel Pretzel milkshake. Amazing. Really, I could taste every flavor.  Total rival for Cookout.  I was really pleased. I'll definitely come back here sometime, I may hit the drive through just for a milkshake."}
{"text":"I really dig their french fries! Greasy burgers, but that's why I go. Plenty of flavor to be had."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with a few of my co-workers; it was probably 2:15 when we arrived. It was not busy, and we were greeted immediately after entering the restaurant. Although it was a couple minutes until we were sat - the server who sat us had a smile on her face. 
We were waiting for a third person to join us, but she was literally two minutes behind us. The server doubled check how many guests we had (3), and came back with silverware - and by then the third guest joined us. 
He greeted us politely, and asked if we were ready to order our drinks. Of course we had to get milkshakes - they were half priced! After a couple of minutes he came back and asked if we were ready to order our meals - and we did. 
It did not seem that long before our food came out! It was all hot, and quick. The food did come out before the milkshakes, but they did come out right after the food.
The chocolate milkshake was delicious! But it was so thick, I could not use the straw. I do like thicker shakes, but not that think - just my personal preference, nothing against SNS. 
I also ordered the 3.99 double burger (which came with fries). The fries are thin and crispy, but yummy! The burger came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, ketchup and onions (no onions for me though). They are suppose to be thin burgers, but they were flavorful. 

Overall, the food was yummy and the server (and everyone else we encountered) were very polite and welcoming!

P.S. Our server was Keith!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow and unfriendly service. At one point, I actually called the restaurant phone number because we couldn't get anyone's attention. The food was ok when it finally came, but the service was so bad that we will find another restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited long time then server was like she was doing us a favor, server said \"we are busy, wait\" table was wet, they didn't care, won't go ever."}
{"text":"This is the worst Steak 'n Shake I've ever been to food is horrible service is horrible and the wait time is unbearable I will never visit this location ever again!!!"}
{"text":"1st Star: burgers were good and hot.
2nd Star: fries were hot and fresh, lightly salted.
3rd Star: 2 combos for $10.50, wow!
4th Star: lady at the window was extremely polite.

I'm taking away a star because the outside needs some TLC. Black and white awning is torn and worn. Also, a big pot hole in Drive-thru."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at the Steak  'n Shake on South Blvd after a afternoon of boating on Lake Wylie. The whole reason we stopped is that online it said that they had \"8\" good Vegetarian choices and since we had a Vegetarian with us, we decided to give it a go. We sat in line for around 15 minutes, but it was fine we were looking at the menu online. But Alas when we got to the order microphone we were unhappy to hear that not one of the \"8\" items they mentioned online did they have. They were supposed to have a Veggie Burger and a Vegetarian Melt. Nope....they had Cheese Fries they said, that's  all. So we had no choice but to order the cheese fries, and we ordered a couple of sandwiches. The cheese fries were just the small order of fries with some Cheese Whiz stuff on them, not hot but cool. I ordered a Frisco Burger which was two white pieces of bread with a couple of paper thin patties on them and a sauce that was like a tomato mayonnaise, the amount of grease was intense. The bread was suppose to be sourdough and thick but it was not. My husband got a Portobello and Swiss burger, his was probably the best, but also almost 7 dollars. I realize this is NOT a vegetarian place but usually in todays society with so many people opting out of red meat you would think they would have had an option, like they described online.  I remember when Steak'n Shake first came out it was really good....Not so much anymore!"}
{"text":"Visited to location after a movie. For starters, the parking lot is littered with trash. One of the front doors handles has been torn off with a sign to use other door.  Followed by no greeting when we entered, seemed like the hostess actually scurried away to avoid doing their job. Like the outside state of disarray, the inside mimicked this. Promptly left- so I can't say anything regarding the food- but good luck if you give this place a try."}
{"text":"They used to be so good.  I really want them to be good.  But every time I go back to see if they figured it out, I get disappointed.  

I give up."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. Cold French fries, cold hamburger, half melted milk shake. No ketchup, no salt, no napkins were given. Asked cashier for the condiments, she said they were in the bag.  No, they weren't. Very disappointed, next time, no there won't be a next time!"}
{"text":"Sorry i don't mean to go in on them but this is so un acceptable when i open a slider i expect so much more"}
{"text":"This place is in the perfect location for anyone  leaving the AMC movies and needing a late night meal. The Double Bacon cheeseburger and fries were really good along with the caramel apple shake. The waitress I had was really good, but the food came out 5-10 minutes later than it should. Overall I was surprised that the service was going to be good based on my last visit."}
{"text":"My coworkers called me and asked if I wanted to join them for lunch. I said yes and would meet them there. They sat and got the table and I was maybe two minutes behind them. I asked if they ordered or anything and they said no. Not even a minute later the server came over and asked for our drinks. I opted this time to get a milkshake even in this weather, plus it was half price (between 2-5). I was sad they got rid of the fudge brownie so I got the chocolate chip cookie dough instead. I wish the server told me they just started there seasonal shakes because I absolutely LOVE peppermint and would have gotten that. The table we sat at did not have those paper \"place mats\" therefore I didn't see it on my own. I had the jalapeño crunch burger which is my go to there. It isn't too spicy but the spice is definitely there and I am sure if you want spicier, just ask for more jalapeños! Sometimes I get extra spicy mayo on the side to dip it in to add spice instead, this time I did. The fries are skinny cut and are always delicious thanks to the seasoning they have on every table. The server, Keith, was great. He was friendly and quick. He brought out our milkshakes right after the food came out (which was maybe 30 seconds) but the food came out fairly quick. It all looked delicious and it was hot and fresh! Keith came back after a couple of bites to check on us which is great and after we were finished eating he asked if we needed anything else as he cleared the table off. We asked for to go cups for our shakes and then went up front to pay, which he also cashed us out."}
{"text":"I have to say it's been a long time since I've experienced the feeling of ineptitude to such a degree as I did tonight. I felt bad for the wait staff because the kitchen was a hot mess.   According to the manager he had all new staff and they were NOT efficient.  I've worked in restaurants where the cooks weren't getting the orders out.   It was uncomfortable then and it is now as a customer to witness. I'm a patient person, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"One of the very few places the boyfriend and I can both eat for under $10. The burgers and fries were pretty good for the money, one step up from drive-through. I like that they have the cajun seasoning out on the table. However, our service was not very good. They were busy and had 2 servers working, the other server was running circles around our server. My water did not get refilled the entire meal."}
{"text":"Was able to order in a timely fashion, then the manager left.. Once he left, a group of 4 guys came in and the server bumped their order up in front of mine. I had already been waiting for about 15 mins prior to the party of 4. She stated \"those my people\"...
The kitchen area was a complete disaster as well. If the server  (older white female) did less talking and actually did her job correctly, the rating would be a little higher. 
She was too busy talking about coworkers and their personal business instead taking care of customers."}
{"text":"Why, oh why do I keep going to Steak and Shake?  Because of coupons, of course.  They send out sheets of 'em.  And even though they say that you cannot use them with other offers (such as, say, another coupon), you can actually use them with one another.  We actually were able to pile three of them onto one ticket.  Sweet.

Unfortunately, that is the absolute high point of the evening, other than the fact that they were close to where we were going.  The service actually blows.  It takes a long time to get someone to acknowledge that you are there.  It then takes even longer to get a table.  Then if you are lucky they might tell you that they will be with you in a minute while they clean the tables that look like they have been sitting there dirty since you walked in (while not actually taking your order).

Once your order is taken, it actually comes out fairly quickly - unfortunately there is almost no taste to it.  The problem appears to stem from the guy on the grill who is mashing those thin little burgers into smithereens, making them into something approaching shoe leather.  It would be nice if they had a bit of juice left to them perhaps.  If you try their seasoning it can help, but you are really just adding salt."}
{"text":"Great fast food burgers
Friendly folks working here
Much better than other fast food
Wish we had them in Minnesota"}
{"text":"The food is great as you probably already know. But they are SLOW here at this location. wasnt even half full and I waited like ten minutes to have someone take my order. But the food like I said was worth waiting for.........."}
{"text":"It was a great stop for me and the kids after the movies. The footlong hot dog I had wad loaded with and the skinny fries were good as well. Not my first time here but will be back for another Peanut Butter chocolate shake. Yeah."}
{"text":"Hello friends,

This was my 2nd visit to S&S in my life. The first time was years ago before going across the street for a movie. Well I haven't been back since because I think I paid almost $25 bucks for to people!!!!!  Whaaaaaad????

Well, me & mine tried it out the other day to My Surprise the prices were/are much mOre My Wallet (debit card) friendly. It was packed. I don't think I've ever Ben to a fast food spot that has a \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. Well, we did wait. The menu is pretty nice. 

I got a burger with a fried egg on it. Umm mm good. I also got the Parmesan & herb fries. Really good. But I'm a fry guy and the portion left MUCH to be desired. I know I coulda ordered another order but.....

They offer ROOT BEER!!!! Emmmm

I'll be back for sure, especially now hat I know it's not 50 bucks for lunch or dinner. 

TTFN"}
{"text":"I love Steak N' Shake, but this location is awful!!! 30 minutes in the drive thru line?! Are you freaking kidding me? AWFUL food on top of it. So disappointed and the staff have no desire to move any faster. I mean, I expect a wait - not a ridiculous wait!!! What the heck is wrong with this place?"}
{"text":"Nah. Wont be back. I know, I know, its fast food. But it wasn't!! That shit took forever! I ordered a burger with fries. Simple, right? My food was cold and I don't care how good you all claim those fries to be, they're WAY too thin and flavorless. Don't you DARE compare them to McDonald's, either! This place is loaded with kids, way too loud, and looks dirty. Our server was the best thing about it. Fuk atta here! I'm out!"}
{"text":"Great and fast service. The waitress was super friendly and the food was fresh. I would go back and tell others about this location. The prices are totally fair and affordable."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Waited an hour for our food...never even got drink refilled.  We walked out and didn't look back. Horrible service and the place was dirty. Total waste of space."}
{"text":"Of course the food is good, however, I agree with other's reviews regarding the amount of time it takes to get your order."}
{"text":"Its not terrible, but its not great either.
Expect to get semi warm food with something ALWAYS missing.
I'm not exactly sure why either, most of the waitresses are pleasant and friendly.
The atmosphere is clean and well maintained.
The problem is SOLELY that every time I've been here the order is never 100% correct or hot. Its pretty off-putting."}
{"text":"They have many meals for around $4 or slightly higher. I had an American Classic breakfast. It included 2 eggs any style, decent hash browns, bacon or sausage patty, and two pancakes. The eggs were cooked as requests the has browns were well browned and crispy on outside. The big surprise were the pancakes. I am very particular about my pancakes. These were light and fluffy with a slightly crispy rim. Perfect. I went back the following day and they were just as good. These pancakes rivaled those at the Original Pancake House in Charlotte. And this meal was $3.99."}
{"text":"Do not go later at night. Waited 30 mins and food was cold and wrong. Poor service poor food"}
{"text":"Food is okay, slowest service ever. Don't come here if you're hungry, come here if you think you might be hungry in a couple hours. Seriously, they're that slow"}
{"text":"Yuck. The shakes were ok but it was gone 20 minutes before my bugler came out.  Its was ok, nothing special. Yes the price is low but I expected more since we had to wait to be seated"}
{"text":"I grew up in St. Louis and Steak'n Shake was our go to burger joint. So today, my Mom and I were out running errands and decided to hit the good ole SNS. And, to our surprise, nothing has changed. It was just as good as we remembered.

We arrived around 12:30 and the place was packed. However, we were greeted by a smile asking if we preferred a table or booth, booth no doubt. Once seated we were quickly approached by our waitress who took our drink order and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu.
We both went with the original double steakburger, mine with cheese and fries.  OMG, the burgers were amazing.  Thin steak patties fries to perfection, served on a grilled bun with lettuce, tomato, onion and ketchup, mustard and mayo...the perfect combination.  The fries are great shoestring fries lightly salted.  My Mom ordered a chocolate milkshake which hit the spot.
The service was spot on, the food amazing and I love that no matter how many SNS restaurants you go to they are set up the same way, old school diner style with people enjoying burgers and fries.."}
{"text":"Another formula chain restaurant, Steak'n Shake is nationwide with their burgers, fries and fantastic milkshakes. Yes, they have plain old boring cheeseburgers, but they also offer a broad variety of toppings to satisfy the taste buds of every carnivore - mushrooms, guacamole, cheese (american or cheddar), BBQ style, even one they call \"The Royale\" which comes with bacon, cheese and a fried egg.

Fries are the thinner shoestring variety and they're not terribly greasy and are surprisingly not oversalted.

Service is hit or miss. I've heard horror stories of rude staff. Today, my waitress was just so good that I not only mentioned it to the manager, I called their customer \"complaint\" line and told them how great she was.

Steak n' Shake is open 24 hours. They have a sign on the door today that they're open on Thanksgiving Day, so perhaps if you burn the turkey and mush the mashed potatoes, you can come here instead.

Warning! The parking lot is very clearly marked as for SnS guests only. If the Lynx lot is full, you do NOT want to park here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some milkshakes with my family after getting off the light rail at 10p. We waited in the drive thru from 10-1013p and all we got was the person inside just said it was going to be a second! After we waited over 13 minutes, and never even had our order taken, we pulled away and went to a competitor with much better service!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this Steak and Shake so many times that i decided to give it a try. Going to a fast-food joint, i was not expecting much, but my experience was great. The food was great compared to other fast food joints (mcdonalds, wendy's, etc.) especially the milkshakes. The place really brings back the times and gives it a nice old feeling of how casual dining usually was. The servers were nice, the food was good, and it was cheap. This place is great and i will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I like the food but the drive thru is always soooooooooo slow. Like turtle slow. If you're freaking hungry, don't bother waiting in line."}
{"text":"I think this is the location of where I experienced Steak and Shake for the first time.  I'm glad to see the location is still going strong.   Most of my high school experience was spent watching movies at Carolina Pavilion with their then \"new\" stadium seating concept.  Man, I am old.  

Anyways...  service was pretty quick and prompt and we got our orders and ate happily.  Our server actually saved me a couple of bucks if I ordered an extra slider... good tip on the wallet... bad on the waistline.

Pretty satisfied - good to know what you are getting into when you walk in the door.  Fast quick food, not necessarily the healthiest options, but the milkshakes make it all worth it (for me)."}
{"text":"I had written a nice 3-star review for this place last night but then an hour after stopping there for dinner I got sick so they lost a star.

The good things include the juicy burgers can be customized to your tastes and there are coupons galore available for various discounts.  Also, they have great milkshakes here.

The bad things include the service at the drive through.  They don't seem to comprehend what you order.  I ordered an unsweet tea and I received a sweet tea.  Thankfully, this tea wasn't the deathly sweet kind of 20 parts sugar to 1 part tea like you get at most fast food places.  What I received was a lightly sweetened tea which was actually refreshing.

What made me sick, I have no idea.  But it had to come from this place since that last thing I had to eat was 8 hours prior and it definitely hurt my chances of ever returning to this location."}
