{"text":"First time there. I was excited to try this place out however disappointed with the service. We had reservations and was seated immediately. Once we reached our table we didn't see our server for about 10 mins. Finally she appeared and asked us very hastily what we would like to drink. After this it was downhill. She took care of the 3 parties surrounding us yet failed to check on us or ask if we were ready to order. I literally had to snag her and request she take our order. I felt so rushed through the process. No small talk, no intro to what the restaurant's specials were, no suggestions-nothing. Very uncomfortable order taking as though we were at an upscale fast food restaurant. As far as the food is concerned- the spinach dip was good, as well as the croissants (that weren't offered). However the $29 filet was mediocre. Minimum seasoning and the mashed potatoes taste more sour then potatoes.   Overall it was not a good experience especially after spending $91 for 2 steaks, spinach dip and 2 soft drinks.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. We are always greeted with smiles and friendly staff. Our drinks are never empty. They seem to be known for there endless drink service. As for the food, its always delicious. Its a little more expensive than most places, but you definitely get what you pay for. My favorites here are: spinach dip, chicken cibatta sandwich, chicken club salad, baby back ribs, parmesan crusted chicken, short smoked salmon, and their hawaiian top sirloin (they only have on fri. And sat. Nights, but its to die for)."}
{"text":"It had been a while sine I was in Charlestons.  Now I wonder way!!!  From salad thru entree, all excellent.  Ribs are some of the best I have tried. Service was awesome. Atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Go with the garlic mashed.  Then to top it all off, bread pudding.  Next time I will start with the bread pudding, as it is incredible.  Thanks for a great dinner, and see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch. Love the pizza appetizer. If u like ranch get a side of ranch with it.   Wife usually gets the crispy chicken salad (it's big could easily share it). I like the chicken sandwich. I've heard the prime rib sandwich is good too. Fries are awesome, very crispy shoestring style.   Service is always above average. A little pricey for lunch, but the food is good so that takes some of the sting out of it."}
{"text":"Merriam-Wester.com defines brownie as \"A small square or rectangle of rich usually chocolate cake often containing nuts.\"  But those of us who love brownies know that a brownie can be so much more.  Ask any American, and they would most likely tell you that they have had several brownies in their lifetime.  Brownies can vary in ingredients, and therefore, in texture and taste. A truly good brownie tastes delicious, smells good and looks appetizing.  When a brownie is also a good value that is the icing on the cake, so to speak. There is nothing quite as good as a warm, rich, delicious brownie.  The Caramel Nut Brownie at Charleston's Restaurant is the best of the best.    Charleston's Caramel Nut Brownie is a huge brownie, served warm, with creamy vanilla ice cream.  It is topped with delicious hot fudge topping, as well as a decadent caramel sauce, sprinkles of crunchy pecan slivers, and sweet, fluffy whipped topping.    Other restaurants, such as Chili's and BJ's, offer brownies on their dessert menu, but none compare to the Caramel Nut Brownie.  Chili's web site describes its Brownie Sundae as a \"Warm, rich chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge.\"  I found the brownie to be hard, and the vanilla ice cream to be bland, hardly worth the $5.79 price. BJ's Restaurant web site describes its BJ's Brownie as \"Baked to order and served piping hot, this brownie with walnuts is topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge and mountains of whipped cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup and topped with a cherry.\" At $5.75, BJ's brownie is not a great value.  BJ's brownie is small, dry and tasteless.  The walnuts are bitter, and the whipped topping tastes artificial.  When you order the Caramel Nut Brownie, the first thing you notice is the mouth-watering aroma.  The combined smell of the chocolate brownie and the caramel sauce is intoxicating.  Next, you will notice the size of the brownie.  It is huge, measuring at least four inches square, and two inches thick.  Of course, the most important thing about a brownie is the taste.  The brownie is fresh, and melts in your mouth.  It has an amazing chocolate taste.  The coldness of the creamy vanilla ice cream provides a perfect contrast to the warmth of the brownie. The ice cream is sweet, but not too sweet, and has an authentic vanilla flavor.  The hot fudge is warm, and rich.  The caramel sauce is the best I have ever tasted.  It is buttery, and thick, with just a hint of toffee flavor. On top there's a fresh, airy whipped topping and a sprinkling of fresh roasted pecan slivers.   You may think that the $5.99 price is high for a dessert, but once you see the size of the brownie, you will realize its value.  The brownie is big enough to share with your dining companion; therefore the value is increased even more. Be aware, though, that once you taste the Caramel Nut Brownie at Charleston's, you might not want to share!  I urge you to try the Caramel Nut Brownie at Charleston's.  I am sure you will agree that  it tastes delicious, smells wonderful, looks incredible and is a great value."}
{"text":"A week ago I went to Charleston's to pick up a dinner for Take-Out. This was my 1rst time at this establishment. I wanted their \"Prime-Rib\".I have used another restaurant in the area for \"Prime-Rib\" and they cannot get the degree of \"Prime-Rib\" that I like....So I wanted to make sure that it would come Medium-Rare. The manager of the place came over to me and took my order. I was shocked . That is in a great way. When the order was ready he showed me the \"Prime-Rib\" before I took it w/ me. Well needless to say this was the best \"Prime-Rib\" that I have ever had in Arizona!!! The Horse-Radish sauce is out of this world..(gotta get it)...Oh they have an app called Shrimp-Cargot....YUM.....I was very impressed by Charleston's....And I would also like to thank the manager, Mr.Jamie Phillips."}
{"text":"In the area for business, solely went off Yelp reviews of Charleston's. Wasn't disappointed, ribs were very good. Service by Isaac the bartender was outstanding. Oh and yes the bread pudding is that good."}
{"text":"When you walk in, it's dark and relaxing. The atmosphere is nice, quiet, with alot of dark wood highliting the place. The food is good, but be careful because the price can add up quickly. This will always be a restaurant I go to, with burgers and steaks and spinach dip. The best way to think of this place, is a lower grade of Houstons. It's almost there, but not quite."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in az.  The food is top notch and value is absolutely the best for quality.  I have compare many restaurants over the years and nothing better the charelston's.    Today, because it's so hot I am having a delicious chicken salad.  My husband loves the catfish and baked potato.  Staff works together to keep everyone taken care of."}
{"text":"Salmon Cesar Salad = the bomb dot com! The salmon is always cooked perfectly. Lettuce is always fresh and they always modify the dish for me! Love the atmosphere and the places is always clean. Good wait staff! I hate the service at the Ahwatukee location (Ray Rd.), so I travel all the way to Mesa to enjoy the Charleston's experience."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving Charleston's 3 stars is because it's so damn expensive. I do feel like there should be a sign at the door that says \"THIS PLACE IS UBER-CLASSY, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PETSMART NEXT DOOR.\" We brought our two young kids, which immediately felt inappropriate because the place has a very dim, romantic vibe. The food was very good, above-average fare. They DID have kids menues (despite the fact that it didn't feel family-friendly) but they were the MOST expensive kids meals I have ever seen. If we were on a tight budget, I think we would have walked out as soon as we looked at the prices, like $15+ for the average entree. Again, the food WAS very tasty, but I would recommend this place for a first date or a special occasion because of the ambiance, atmosphere, and cost."}
{"text":"$30 for a small piece of dry meat and a baked potato? They got a lot of balls. Bread was good though."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were great. Now going on two straight days of food poisoning after eating their Rotisserie Chicken. Don't eat their Chicken. They obviously do not know how to cook it properly. :("}
{"text":"I was impressed. The portions are huge. I had the chicken fried steak. It was delicious! Not a compressed \"meat patty'. I could not finish it. The vegetables were fresh. The service was outstanding! Prompt and assertive. I highly recommend this place. You won't leave hungry!!!"}
{"text":"We came in and were promptly seated as well as promptly greeted by the waitress. The young girls that greeted us as we walked in and seated us were very young but polished to be very polite. The waitress that we had for the evening was so great to us that she really made our experience fantastic. I tried to make note to try and remember her name to include in the review and I'm hoping I'm getting it somewhat right but I believe it was Eman or Emon or Evon? I apologize but it was something exotic. Anyways she was so friendly to us and so smart with all the details of the menu. I loved her so much I even told her she should be a model instead of waitress even if she was great at it ha! I also have to command her on how great she was at bringing us out new drinks for what felt like the very second we took more than two sips. Nothing like just ice when your eating something salty and need to wash it down. Also my hubby could not decided what to get and had a million questions like he always does on everything on the menus and she really had the patience to stand there with us answering all his questions with no irritation (which is hardly ever the case with people these days) despite the restaurant seemingly being very busy and her looking like she was running all over the place when she wasn't checking on us giving us drinks or taking our order. I believe she had tables spread out all over the restaurant. The food was also all cooked perfectly and seasoned beautifully. Hubby got a steak with a baked potato and I got the ribs with beans and fried. Both so yummy, had to stop my hubby from eating both his meal and my meal ha! The only problem I had was that I didn't find this place sooner!(I'm surprised we even found it since it is tucked away in the back in a parking lot behind a highway ha) Even as we were enjoying our food we had a manager check in on how everything was going and she was so polite and nice making sure that everything went over well not even knowing that it was all going fantastically. This is how all restaurants should be I was just blown away with the great service and great food. Great job to you Charlestons and all of your team. I'm sure we will be back the next opportunity we get!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and a glass of wine..... sat in a booth in the bar.  The waitress / bartender  was clearly sporting a big time attitude.  She did not seem to have the time or the inclination to provide any type of decent service.  A different server brought some water and then she managed to get a glass of wine poured --- took about five minutes in a mostly empty bar area.  Several waiters were hanging in the bar watching the Wisconsin vs Ohio State game so there was no shortage of servers.  The bartender never checked back --- finally came around and seemed be very put out to have to explain the one (1) special they were offering --- I ordered and she walked away before I could ask for some bread....  I had to go track her down to make that request---- then the bread and the food and the salad all came at the same time.....no offer of a second glass of wine-------  this bartender (female) has a serious attitude problem --- not to mention the fact that NO ONE sees to be managing this place at all......  look elsewhere for your next evening out ------"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend for her birthday and the food was excellent. The parmesan chicken was delicious. The staff was very professional and friendly. Thank you again."}
{"text":"We arrived for a late night dinner and self-seated in the bar. The service was amazing and the food was even better. We will definitely be back. I was craving some fried catfish and they delivered. I was able to swap my sides and had some amazing glazed carrots and burgundy mushrooms. We also had some smoked salmon with fried okra and cucumber salad. The food was really a super surprise and Isaac totally took care of us!! It was late, but no one rushed us or made us feel like we had to leave."}
{"text":"Bar service is horrible in the booths. I have been here 3 different times on my business travel. Bartender and 2 other employees chatting with each other are more interested in themselves than the customer. 6 people in the bar.   I am sitting here writing this review goin on 10 min. Walked by 3 x. No menu or acknowledgement.    12 minutes gone by and lady bartender with short hair finally comes and gives me a menu.   If the place was busy I get it. 750 pm local and not busy. Just employees too busy chatting.   Lost my business for the future. Maybe they need some lessons from the staff at Capital Grill across the street."}
{"text":"First time here, although I'm driven by them 500 times at least. I had the grilled pork chops, which were nice and juicy, cooked perfectly. The one thing I wasnt thrilled with was my mashed potatoes. I liked them, I just dont really like them when they are lukewarm. Nitpicky I guess. However, had the Shrimp Cargot for an appetizer, which was fantastic. I'll definately go again, but I'll have to do a little more research and find out the best thing to have."}
{"text":"When I was pregnant with my daughter, this place had the only food I could hold down.  Love their steak and garlic mashed potatoes!  They have the best house salad I've ever had, and the croissant is fantastic.  They have great service.  Can be pricey, but totally worth it.  I'd pick it over Texas Roadhouse everytime (which is how we ended up there in the first place!)"}
{"text":"Great food, fun friendly staff. Our group enjoyed every item they ordered on the menu the bar tender made the best drinks in Arizona.  This is a fantastic spot worth stopping by, do call to book a table because it get very busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"Best ribs I ever had. Never got my fingers messy as the meat fell right off the bones. Great garlic mashed too. Wife got the salmon and was very pleased. My mother recommended this place and she was right on. Highly recommend, and good friendly sarvice too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants by far! Some of my favorite dishes: shrimp cargot, chicken fried steak, and potato soup. I also enjoy their carmelized carrots and mashed potatoes..both to die for!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Sat in the bar and the bartenders are nice."}
{"text":"For years my mother loved going to this restaurant.  We have lots of good memories there with her.  She passed away last fall and my son and I decided to go celebrate the passing of his road test just like we would have if she were still here.  Boy, have things changed!  What an expensive mistake!   The service was fine - nice greeting and nice server.  The food - what a mistake.  I ordered the fish and chip special of the day.  I was tempted to take a picture of my plate.  I was served 5 tiny pieces of fish.  They looked like fish McNuggets.  They were dwarfed by the container of tartar sauce!  My plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw.  I drank iced tea. My son ordered a ruben sandwich.  It looked flat and it did not taste good. He drank water.  The bill - over $30!!!  So totally not worth it.  I walked out hungry.  Sorry mom - I will not go back."}
{"text":"The prime rib is unbelievable!!! Get it with the raw horseradish and dip it in the sauce. It is a party in the mouth!! Service is surprisingly fast, and very nice. Love a place with friendly people."}
{"text":"Incredible food! Incredible Service! Incredible atmosphere! Incredible people! My wife and I love this place and can not get enough of the prime rib. Get it with both the creamy and raw horseradish. We love great places like this but it The general manager on why we continue to keep coming back again and again. Thank you Brice Nerland! You are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing everything! Steak is one of the best I have had! The service was great. The drinks were wonderful. The atmosphere was superb. The desserts were delicious. The ribs are incredible."}
{"text":"I went to Charleston's with my family. We were seated promptly which is always nice with kids. My husband ordered a glass wine, which he enjoyed. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. It came out hot and was good. My husband ordered the salmon as his meal. It was slightly overcooked but was still good. I had the shrimp scampi and it was good. The atmosphere is great here. Very quiet. The server was always on top of everything."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with great service. I can't remember my waitresses name but she was very friendly and funny. The shrimp cargo is fabulous and the baby back ribs were amazing. I'm lucky enough to have this place close by my house. Will be coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"The BARBEQUE BABY BACK RIBS were a tasty surprise! Hands down the best bbq around."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for at least 6 years.  The quality of the food has gone down quite a lot this past year.  It used to be our family's favorite place to dine and have prime rib.  We brought some friends over for dinner last month and was very disappointed.  Also, they didn't cook the meat as we wanted.  When we complained they only offered to put it back on the grill. No apologies.  Service was mediocre and the quality of the meet is not as good as it used to be.  I am sad as i had hoped that things would be as they used to be... A quality dining restaurant.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"this place is fabulous there Hawaiian steak was the best we have only been here once and we came here only because the steak place across from them was crowded but we will be back for sure the food is great and very reasonable prices for the quality of service and food"}
{"text":"Best bread pudding in the state maybe in the world!  Ribs are great as well meat falls right off the Bone."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Came for lunch and spent $60. Mediocre food and rushed service. Won't be back.   Hal S. From Charlestons attempted to contact me by phone but Yelp's message system did not cooperate, However even his attempt is to be commended."}
{"text":"This is a chain steakhouse. I usually have the Fillet Mignon - rare, it melts in my mouth. I get the Cesar salad with croissant, garlic mashed potatoes or french fries, sauteed mushrooms, my mouth is watering thinking about it. My iced tea is always full. My biggest complaint is that the wine selection is pretty bad for a steak house and the staff isn't sure weather or not they have a corkage fee. Waiters & waitresses are usually very nice and accommodating. A few times they have not cooked the steak correctly, they are good at fixing it for you, or giving you gift certificates to make up for it."}
{"text":"Good food, speedy lunch service and nice people.  Enough said."}
{"text":"With all of the advertising we decided to stop in for our 2 o' clock lunch. I have never had chicken fried steak before and thought since this was an American cuisine place I'd try it. Needless to say I disliked it a lot. The presentation was great, it came with a heaping mound of potatoes and instead of the carrots I ordered the fried okra. The gravy was good, I believe it was a chipotle gravy. Fried okra doesn't come across in many restaurants in town and I thought their's was pretty good! We tried the fried catfish which was awesome and so was the rib roast sandwich. The portions were plentiful and could feed a small village. Prices range from $9-$15. We wanted to try their keylime pie but they ran out. The service was pretty good. They kept our drinks full and were attentive without bring obnoxious. I would go back again but just won't order the chicken steak. That's just my preferance- it might be great for someone else."}
{"text":"Dine with a party of four and we all enjoyed it. Our server was very patient with several questions regarding food ingredients.  They took special precautions for allergies. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The good: wonderful ambience, friendly service, salad was very fresh, amazing burgers, nice wine selection, great croissants & duo dip. The not so good: I was disappointed with the chicken kale soup.   I was expecting homemade deliciousness but it tasted like canned soup with mushy vegetables and extra chicken (the chicken was good) added to it. If the restaurant wasn't so busy the night we were there I would've sent it back as I wasn't able to finish it. The rest of the meal though was quite good."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is great and the staff is excellent.  They remember you when you come in it feels like home"}
{"text":"I love Charleston's. My experience has shown that everything they make tastes good. It's a great choice for a date because the atmosphere is a kind of darker and intimate. The food quality is a clear step above a place like Outback or Texas roadhouse, but it won't totally bust the bank."}
{"text":"I used to love this place because they had a huge variety like the Cheesecake Factory (aka something for everyone). But when I went in April they completely cut down the menu and all the good dishes are gone. I was really disappointed and expected more."}
{"text":"I go here as a client nearly every 3 weeks and have had nearly everything on the menu other than the fish dishes. By far the best salads and sandwiches in the area and for that matter in the state. The service is second to none with everyone working together and as friendly as can be. Our waiter yesterday was Jonathan and he was very pleasant and made our group feel appreciated for choosing Charleston's.  I will certainly continue to frequent the establishment nearest to my work and most likely check out others when I am outside my bubble."}
{"text":"Charleston's never let's me down. Our waitress, Kendall, was very energetic and gave the best waitressing service I have ever received! A must go for an evening dinner or a late lunch. Their croissants are the best and a must if you go!"}
{"text":"As an FYI, They have very limited seating for any party over 4, in fact only two tables that can truly comfortably accommodate more than 4, regardless of what they say.  We called two days in advance for a reservation for a party of 6 at 5:OOpm.  First it took the hostess four attempts to locate the name on her list. We were shown to a table that consisted of two small tables put together to accommodate four people, but they then crammed in two extra chairs so they could try and fit six.  The poor folks sitting in the middle would have to straddle between two tables.  To add to the fiasco, this makeshift set up  was just a few short steps from their open kitchen and waitstaff runway, the absolute very worse table in the entire restaurant.  They claim their long booths can hold 6, well maybe if two of the people are infants.   I Would rather the management just be honest and say, we only have  two tables that can seat 6+ and both are booked. Food was fine, nothing to die for,  but fine.  The manager did come by, but only to give us his card???    Disappointing experience and will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Seems like man agent needs to shake things up.  We ate there sat. Night, very crowded, food good for price. Went back with another couple Sunday, and it was totally different. Not crowded, no wait for a table. The waitress informed us of the things they were\" out of\" at 7 pm on Sunday. Several entree choices and no more baked potatoes. So we ordered around that and the mgr came out and apologized for the screw ups and said that now they were out of mashed potatoes too and he was embarrassed that this was happening. So we opted for a different side. Food was pretty good, but it took an hour to get it. Our waitress would leave to get the answer to a question,( is there still meat for a French dip) and it took her 15 mins to retun.  The fastest service we got was when we received our bill. Sorry won't be back."}
{"text":"This has long been one of my favorite restaurants but our last visit was especially great.  The waitress Maryellen was phenomenal in every way and made sure we were completely comfortable and happy.  Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"My neighbor wanted to come here for dinner.  I had not been in a long while. We both had the ribs and I must admit, they were very good.  Tender and they fell off the bone. Fries were good.  Our server talked us into the banana cream pie, so we split.  After tasting it, I should have ordered my own.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Whenever it is my dads pick for dinner we always end up at Charleston's. No matter what he always orders the ribs. He says they are extremely tender and just fall right off the bone.  Before he even eats his ribs, he loves chomping on their delicious buttery croissants. If you don't care about calories, then you must not pass these croissants up. My mom and I usually go for the baked chicken which is always delicious, but they have a wide variety of food to choose from. Whenever we go there we can make reservations and even last minute. Also, the service is always great and they are on top of things.  I have a feeling we will going to Charleston's on Father's Day so he can chow down on his BBQ ribs!"}
{"text":"We went yesterday for lunch. Omgosh Amazing croissants!! I've always gotten the salmon, yesterday's fish of the day was sword fish so i ordered that for a change it was cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend had the prime rib (he said it was Excellent as usual)  only downside here is they don't have a lunch menu so it is pricey for a lunch time meal"}
{"text":"I had an excellent french dip sandwich today  It was one of the  best I have ever had   Great service"}
{"text":"Went to dinner this past weekend with family to one of our \"regular\" places\". We have found over the past year that Charleston's has not been near as consistent as it used to be. Our favorite meals seem to have lower quality meats and they have changed their menu so salads are no longer included.  It's really no longer an average priced place, but it's become very average food :("}
{"text":"Great spot ! Surprised how charming it was on the inside!  Both our dinner choices were very good  Definitely would return to Charlestons."}
{"text":"Very good Ruben! My Husband had the chicken fried steak.  I tried his and it was amazing.  I will get that next time. Great food and service. The best sandwiches in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing sellections, good prices.  Very friendly staff.  Willing to accommodate even the most difficult of vegan diets.  Thumbs UP!  I had the Chicken Marsalla.  It was good, but not the best I've had.  The portions are nice size.  I have nothing negative to say about them."}
{"text":"Been here countless of times in the last 12 years. Every single time service, food and ambiance always great. Last five years or so. We do request the music volume be lowered by her ur table and we are nicely complied with. Hubby has catfish, prime rib, rib eye, and he loves it. He is extra picky.  I have the rainbow trout, ahi, kale salad with shrimp - love it every time. Love this place.   Hubby left his wallet on the seat once, cash and cards. He called and they were closing. We went back, every single thing was intact in his wallet."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about my dining experience at Charleston's in Scottsdale. I went there with my daughter for lunch today. I started with a cup of the potato soup and it was exceptional. Creamy, fresh and loved the bacon, chives and cheese on top. Then I had the baby back ribs and they were excellent. I make ribs myself and have a hard time finding any better than mine in restaurants. These were better than mine! Hard to say but true. Perfectly cooked, the meat fell off the bone and the sauce was out of this world.  Our server was so good - I think his name was Trini(?). He told us he has worked there for 9 years and he was definitely an experienced and excellent server. The manager Josh stopped by our table to inquire on our satisfaction and even made sure there was never an empty glass on the table. He was such a pleasant and sincere young man and his attention to detail was obvious. It is this type of manager that makes the difference between a good restaurant and a great one. We will definitely be going back soon. Wish I had gotten some ribs to go as I am now craving them! Thanks Charleston's and the staff for making sure our dining experience was exceptional."}
{"text":"On of my go-to restaurants, I always order their Prime Rib, because it's among the best I've found in the valley. Service is always attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for years .. Until last night. Now it is on 'probation'.  My wife and I arrived at 5:45 PM to have dinner in the bar to take advantage of the Happy Hour drink prices.  As I often do I ordered the ribs and chicken combo with mashed potatoes and carrots instead of beans.  My wife has the Roast Chicken dinner, which she enjoyed.  Carrots, as usual, were superb.  Chicken was good as usual.  However, after ordering ,the waitress (who will remain unnamed - actually I forgot her name - the name on the receipt I know was not hers) the waitress came back and said the mashed potatoes will not be ready to serve for another 30 minutes and asked if I would like to get the French Fries instead (they have excellent french fries).  She said she will bring out the mashed potatoes when ready and if I am too far along in the meal she will box it for me to take home.  I agreed.  1) Unfortunately the ribs were not the usual excellent consistent fare ... the meat stuck to the bones as if it was glued on.  Once off the bone the meat was tender enough ... But not much of it.  A major disappointment for the money I spent. 2) She never came with the mashed potatoes ... Not even boxed to take home.  3). She did not provide service ... The two or three times we requested help by either going to the bar to get someone or calling to another waitress who was happening to be walking by ... Someone else helped.  But our waitress was not around  and when I noticed she was getting something from the bar she did not look our way (perhaps management had too many tables assigned to her in the main dining room that she did not have time - therefore not her fault).  Another experience like this and I will assume the level of service and quality of food has changed by design (cheaper input cost) in an attempt to improve their bottom line .. Which is never good for the customer ... I hope I am wrong."}
{"text":"Disappointed by Charleston's reputation. While staying in Scottsdale my girlfriend suggested we eat at Chaleston's because she remember it being so good.What a disappointment I had the Prime Rib that tasted a week old with sauce that tasted like it had Lysol mixed with it. My girlfriend had soup and salad  in which the baked potato soup was good , but later she was sick from the food. If you dare find out for yourself and make your own conclusion."}
{"text":"Wow, Charleston does it again. Burgers were excellent and cooked perfecton. Shrimp Scampi was to die for and you couldn't ask for a better server than Tiffany.  Great lunch experience"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant but it certainly won't be my last. I took my Dad there for his 82 birthday. He's a very \"traditional\" eater...likes his meat, potatoes, and veggies. He ordered the sirloin and said \"this is quite possibly the best steak I've ever had\".  Accompanying his steak was a baked potato with cheese, and he said it was \"flavorful\".  He truly enjoyed his meal and I scored major \"favorite daughter points\". I ordered shrimp scampi with a side salad. The salad was more than just iceberg lettuce. It included hard boiled eggs and bacon. It was good....BUT....the bread that came with it...OH MY!!! This bread just melted in my mouth! So delicious!!! My scampi came with angel hair pasta. It was very good but had maybe just a tad too much lemon. For dessert we shared a brownie with ice cream. The waiter knew it was my dads birthday so he brought it out with a candle on top. Nice touch! The atmosphere was perfect! Not too loud...dim but not too dark. Gaslights were mounted on the walls adding a charming touch to the ambience. Dinner for the two of us was $60, and well worth it. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great as usual!  Service and food was great ! The ambiance inside is always \"classy\" and not too noisy. Prices are really affordable for the quality of the food. Will be back again !"}
{"text":"This is  one of our favorite restaurants & we take out of town visitors here & they love it too.  Order the carrots as one of your sides & the croissants that come with the salad are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my food last night my chicken club had soggy bread and the chicken breast had a consistency like it was pre cooked and heated up.  The service was good however"}
{"text":"This place was good until I decided to go there later towards there closing time. I ordered a salad and it had left over meat shavings in it not sure what happened here but it was gross!"}
{"text":"Server Nick was fantastic! Very nice and funny and attentive in the good way (he checked in on us but did not interrupt). Prime Top Sirloin was fantastic! I highly recommend the Cream Spinach Dip, its soooo good."}
{"text":"Upon arriving at charlestons I was surprised by how little cars were in the parking lot compared to the restaurant capacity. Granted not every table was filled, but with all of them so close together the whole place seemed loud, but not over bearing. Our waitress was short and to the point except for when it came to the desert (always time for an upsell). She seemed busy although I was not able to count how many tables she had without seeming rude. However, busy is busy so I brushed this off. Trying to stray from the pasta as it is my normal go to I asked her if the scampi or cat fish was better, she said catfish so I went with that, my boyfriend ended up getting the Ruben. No bread, no salad, just the entrees. Our food came out and his sandwich looked loaded and my plate looked like a platter. The catfish was very well fried, crisp and crunchy. Although all together far to greasy for me. I could only eat one fillet as it gave me a head ache. I got it with coleslaw and angle hair, their coleslaw was sweet with pickles which isn't my cup of tea but it wasn't bad, and the angle hair was much better with a bit of salt and pepper. My boyfriends Ruben was quite tasty for the little bit I tried.  But all in all the restaurant its self was dark yet welcoming and I may be back to try the scampi... Although a bit pricey (12-26)"}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday night for a table of 5 and advised Hostess that we had a birthday person with us. Poor service. Had to request water twice before we received it, only two meals were served at a time, making some people wait for their food until everyone was served (could have carried more than two at a time or had another server help) requested a take home box three times before it was brought to the table, brought the check and had to then remind them that we were celebrating a birthday. The food was the only pleasant part of the meal. This  location his location is not up to the Charleston's standards. The Scottsdale location is always A+."}
{"text":"The food and the service was wonderful we had Cheeseburger and French fries and dessert of Key Lime pie and Bread Pudding to go it was the best. I will go there again, I have been to the one on Ray Road before but this was a first for the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great steaks with excellent service. Prices and reasonable compared to large chain steakhouses. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Friendly and not too intrusive.   Very nice atmosphere.  Menu prices are very reasonable for the quality.  Great salads.  Most of the food I've tried I have liked.  Just wish there were a few more menu options and that the menu better described the content of dishes (I was surprised there was meat in the bean side).  Try this restaurant.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Close to home and as someone else said; if you have a friends & family with different likes this is always a good place to go and everyone can find something they like.    We always find the service good, and servers are friendly and talkative.  I never have to look at the menu because it is always the Chicken Piquant.  Have had the chefs strawberry salad and it's good but now it's the Chicken.  My husband has the Reuben Sandwich and likes it.  That's a sandwich that some restaurants can't get quite right."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer to Charleston's and I have to say the food is usually good if it's prepared the way it should.  I do at times recommend this place, but a few sometimes I get disappointed on the quality of the food.  Half the time we have to ASK for a HOT baked potato.  Last night was the same situation, the bake potato was just ok and the roasted chicken was dry like it was reheated or sitting under the heat lamp.  So lunch business was probably slower than usual, so I have to guess we were served the leftover chicken.  We're getting tired of the inconsistency and guessing how your meal may turn out.  We have spoken to the manager once but nothings changed.  The staff is always welcoming, but have to reconsider the next time."}
{"text":"Had the mahi mahi.  Food was very good as always.  The service was excellent.  Way to go,  Charleston's wait staff!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I eat here. My family and I had a great dinner service and the only reason I didn't give the five stars were minor service issues.  The food is excellent. It is seasoned well and taste delicious.   The service was great, there was only one occasion where we needed a refilled and actually had to ask for it but all other times, they arrived before we needed the refill. Staff was friendly as soon as you walk through the door until you left.  The other issue was when we went the first time, we saw people getting pieces of bread before their order was ready and we didn't get anything. On this visit, after our order was taken, i asked the staff about the basket of bread that I saw in several tables. The waiter told me that there they provide french bread free of charge and croissants for a small price. I requested a basket of french bread to taste but that order never showed up.   Again, not a big issue but still a valid one. When you are waiting for your food, a piece of bread usually quiets the hunger until your order arrives especially if you have kids."}
{"text":"Such wonderful food and service. Recently had my first experience at Charleston's and I'm leaving as one happy customer. Food was terrific, and the service was some of the best I have ever had. Our waitress had the best recommendations, and always made sure to keep our drinks full. Will most definitely be returning, and cannot wait to try more amazing food."}
{"text":"I typically like to stay away from chain restaurants, but the mister and I were looking for a cheap place and served good food. He suggested Charleston's and I thought \"Hmmm... it looks like Denny's from the outside.\" As soon as we got inside I really liked the interior. It has a nice ambiance... as my friend Peter once said, \"It's where I like to go when I want to feel fancy for a cheap price.\" We had the Honey Burger I think its called and the prime rib au jus sandwich. Both were beyond my expectations. The great surprise was the baked beans that I ordered with my prime rib sandwich! YUMMERS! The burger was one of the best I have had and the sauce with it is just spicy enough to be flavorful, but not overpowering... I am not a big SPICE fan. The one downside was that my boyfriend's fries were cold with his burger, but they instantly brought us new, hot, fresh ones."}
{"text":"Charleston's food is okay, but definitely overpriced.  The food is never bad, but each time I've had it, I've found myself thinking that it should be 2/3 or 1/2 the price.  Case in point; the last time I went there with my wife.  I saw that they had a 14 oz rib-eye steak as their special for $27 and decided to order it medium rare.  The end result was properly cooked and it wasn't overly fatty.  In a word, it was fine.  But that's the problem.  For $27, I expect a lot more than just \"fine\".  If I wanted \"fine\", I would have gone a couple hundred yards away to the Texas Roadhouse and paid half the price for twice the food and a similarly \"fine\" steak.  Oh yeah, and for the $27, I got the steak, and a baked potato.  That's it.  No bread, no salad, nothing.  All that said, my wife got the trout (also on special) for $23 and it was the best trout she's ever had.  She was very happy with her selection since we have paid quite a bit more for trout at dedicated sea food restaurants and the fish wasn't half as good as this one was.  So maybe I just have bad luck here?  I've gotten various chicken dishes in the past and it's been the same story -- \"fine\" meat, but not enough of it and quite a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"We have been dining at Charlestons for years and usually enjoy everything. Service is always excellent!  They have pared the menu down in size which is fine. They have good selection of product. This visit a few things annoyed me though. Our waiter was a little pushy? Don't know if that's the correct adjective? I realize that he wanted to make sure we were looked after right after being seated , however we were waiting for a friend and he knew that and kept asking if we were ready to start.  Overall I liked the appetizer and enjoyed my main ...salmon.  My husband and our friend ordered steak. My husbands steak was over cooked and it was also not good. It might be that we are used to better beef? Not sure... but we remembered always having fairly good beef here.  He was disappointed enough that I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"This place is simply the best!! Great servers, great food, great management!!!! Their prices are really not bad either!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my parents recently, and we all thought the food was delicious.  I ordered the salmon Caesar salad, which I loved.  It had complex layers of flavor and was cooked properly.  I wish I lived close enough to go back often.  My dad ordered the roasted chicken and thought it was very juicy and tender. The mushrooms were delicious as well as the several sides of vegetables my stepmom ordered.  I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"It is one of our favorite places to go.  Food is very good and service is excellent.  Full of ambiance and charm.  On our way home last Monday, we drove over 600 miles just to have dinner there before we returned home.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I always order the Chicken Fried Steak with their Peach Bellini!   Pure deliciousness!!! =P"}
{"text":"Went for Easter Brunch, arrived at noon, no wait. Ordered beverages, artichoke-spinach dip and a salad while we looked over the menu. The dip was disappointing (won't order that again) and our waiter forgot our salads so we waited. When he finally brought them out they were delicious btw. Caesar's aren't that hard to make but people always seem to screw them up. The greens have to be flavorful and consistent and a hint of anchovy helps. The salads are accompanied by a huge honey drizzled crescent roll (yum) Ordered the ribs and a burger for entree and my ribs were perfect, as always. Dessert was brownie sundae and bread pudding. My sundae was a big portion and I had to force myself to finish bc you can't box up ice cream. I always love this place, parking is easy, there is rarely a wait, the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in front of my hotel and I was liking to eat something. I read the reviews I decided to give it a chance. I ordered the oven roasted chicken that was great. It's literally half chicken (breast, leg and thigh). Very well seasoned and cooked. The dish came very fast (3 minutes) and the service was great. Nice fast dinner in a nice and cozy place. Very good quality/price ratio"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good... unassuming exterior, unique decor, excellent service with well-seasoned, hot food. We had lunch on a Saturday, a gamble due to the lack of patrons, I guess. We ordered the spinach-artichoke dip, served hot with light and crispy chips, sour cream and fresh salsa. Beer served cold, poured at the table in an iced glass... Blackened chicken on the Caesar salad was actually spicy, served hot on cold greens, broccoli cooked al dente. After dinner coffee a little weak but the bread pudding was spectacular- no exaggerating. Decently priced, don't be put off by the plain-jane menu."}
{"text":"My family and I went to charleston a for dinner and right away we were greeted by the most amazing girls Sydney and Shelby. They were so sweet and polite and on top of the amazing food it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent salad and you need to try the Chicken Picatta. Delicious! The bar has some tables with TV and the restaurant is very cozy."}
{"text":"Lived here for 6 yrs and never tried this place. That was a big mistake ad this place is great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great that they can accommodate large parties the fries are so good you have to eat them all."}
{"text":"Charleston's... Where to begin.   We happened upon this place mostly by accident. It shares a parking lot with Texas Roadhouse which is a great steakhouse but because of that fact, at any given time it's extremely crowded. We had planned on hitting Texas Roadhouse for dinner before catching a movie at the nearby Mesa Grand AMC Theater. However, as is always the case it was packed, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. Seeing Charleston's across the way, we said why not?   Upon entering the place we were surprised to see how well done the interior was. Classy, with dark wood and stone accents and lit just well enough to maintain an intimate atmosphere. Each table is lit by candles and soft overhead lighting. Up until recently it had some real smooth Jazz playing in the background (which has regrettably been replaced with easy listening/pop fare in an effort to attract a younger crowd).  All of the wait staff male or female is dressed in black slacks and black shirts which may sound pretentious but only adds to the ambiance in practice. They are, in general, extraordinarily attentive and quick to serve. On most weekends, the management helps bring out food, refill drinks and make sure everything is satisfactory. Nice touch.   Now on to the food... oh the food! I have yet to eat a meal that was less than excellent no matter what I order but my favorite is the Baby Back Ribs and Herb Chicken combo. It's a huge plate of food, and it comes complete with garlic mashed potatoes and I opt out on the bbq beans in exchange for the glazed carrots. You MUST eat the glazed carrots if nothing else... I do not like carrots at all mind you, but these I could eat all day until my skin turned orange.  Aside from the carrots, the herb chicken is actually a half a chicken seasoned perfectly and very succulent. I've scoured the internets trying to find the recipe for this bird and it's nowhere to be found. I'm considering a part time stint at this place just long enough to poach the recipe or at least watch the chef do it. Delicious. Sub out the potatoes for the fries (they're crispy, and salt & peppered) and you won't be disappointed either.   It's never as crowded as the neighboring Roadhouse, but to me that's a good reason to check it out. It's great.  Tip: Check out their menu on the web before you go. It'll give you an idea of the kind of food they have in store for you."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with a dinner at Charleston's the other night and it was fantastic!  I had the Hawaiian sirloin and she ordered the West End Chicken.  Both meals were superb we never lacked for anything.  The garlic mashed potatoes were amazing and the carrots as a side dish were also fantastic!  The service was very quick and our glasses were never empty.  The manager stopped by our table to ensure everything was to our liking and asked a couple of times to make sure were well taken care of.    This restaurant is one of the best places for dinner in Mesa and we will definitely be back.  Thank you for such great service and a great meal."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his dad for his dad's birthday. I'm a sufferer of celiac disease, usually steak houses have a good hand full of options for me on the menu. Charleston's had it's own gluten free menu with MANY things, also the menu was an actual menu, not a shoddy old book/ring binder written in comic sans.  The waiter was more than helpful and sympathetic, making sure that none of the food i ordered had gluten or came in contact with any of it. When my plate was brought out to me, the manager, JJ, came out with it to let me know that they took extra care in preparing it and there was no cross-contamination of any kind.  I was shocked, never before have I gone to a restaurant where the servers/cooks/managers cared enough to warn me about certain options or come out to let me know my food wasn't cross contaminated. I've been glutened at restaurants before when ordering off the GF menu, but Charleston's? Not even a little.  Definitely will return. The service is unchallenged in greatness."}
{"text":"There is so much I can say about this place. This place is absolutely amazing. My fist date was here, different holiday dinners, birthdays, anniversaries, and etc... I've never had a single problem. It's a busy restaurant so every time we go, we always make a reservation first or we wait it out like everyone does. The food is awesome, every with a full house, the service is exceptional. The manager is always seen walking from table to table greeting guests, or out front welcoming them in. We always order the prime rib. It's so so good. Although, I was told the previous time they don't serve the prime rib until after 3? Please serve it again regularly!!  I will always come back to this place. I would give them 1000000000 stars if I could! They deserve it! I recommend this place to everyone that I meet, my family, my friends and all of my clientele."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal at Charleston's on Stapley Drive.  Drinks and appetizers were excellent our food which were Chicken & Ribs was outstanding. Would highly recommend Charleston's to anyone, the staff was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"We came here (22 of us) to surprise my mom for her birthday. We already love Charleston's for their food and service but they were able to accommodate my huge family and Brittany and Kevin did a wonderful job! I've been a server for many years and they did a top notch job dealing with such a large group. I never saw an empty glass all of our dishes came out right, plates were cleared in a timely manner and they even cut the cake, served it and washed the cake holder for me! Normally chain restaurants tend to let me down with poor customer service and unprofessional servers but Charleston's truly impressed us. Thank you so much for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Good food, arrives hot, service is spectacular!"}
{"text":"For starters the atmosphere of Charlestons may be my favorite of any restaurant. Its very dark and relaxing, but there is just enough light at the table to read the menu and eat your food. everything from the brick walls to the tables and chairs are made from dark wood, dark brick, dark leather, and even the wait staff wear all black with no logos, so its almost as if they aren't there and just blend into the background, which I'm sure is an intentional and smart idea. The menu is small, but i have had various items on it from the steak sandwich, The Ribs, Chicken Fried Steak and the Burger and they are all worthy of the 5 star.  the sides are also delicious. its a bit pricey but you get plenty of high quality food for your dollar. If you want a nice, quiet, relaxing and delicious meal, i highly suggest Charleston's."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant until today.  My family would meet there once or twice a month.  The food is always good; however, today I found out NO more salad with your meal.  The salad is what set their restaurant apart from others.  I paid $20 for a piece of meat and a baked potato.  No salad, no bread!  I will be looking for another restaurant in the area that gives me a full meal for $20."}
{"text":"Food is okay but very salty and my shrimp scampi had too much red pepper in it. We were seated in the obligatory kid area (high traffic lane near the kitchen). Our server was lackluster. I ordered an iced tea as my beverage and he never brought it. My husband had to ask the food runner for one (she did bring it very swiftly). Cheap eats but I don't think I'll be jumping to go back."}
{"text":"Suuuuuuper slow service, food was overpriced for the quality, drinks from the bar were wrong & it felt like a scene from Cocoon was being filmed in there. Do not recommend at all. Weird lighting too."}
{"text":"Ribs are excellent as is the chicken picatta! Sizes are huge portions! Wish I could've substituted garlic mashed in for fettucine on the Chicken Picatta, but still great! Chicken fried steak is huge, but could do without half the berating. Great peppery taste though! Better come hungry!"}
{"text":"First time here and i have to say they provide VERY great service, i wish i could remember his name. But he was very polite and attentive. The inside is so dark but very nice. The food was good, wish there was more on the menu but everything was delicious! Ordered a Margarita, and a sirloin w/ baked potato. we got there and got seated right away!"}
{"text":"Never left disappointed. Prime rib is the best in town. Cannot beat the garlic mashed potatoes either. But always ask for the specials,because those don't disappoint either ! Don't sneeze at a restaurant known for steaks serving ribs , because the smell with please your senses when you walk in, and if you order them, your stomach will leave happy . great drinks as well! Definitely a crowd pleaser in every way."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend this place there steak was one of the best I had ever had. Plus of course great service."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Good food, I had the baby back ribs that had a good smoke to them and fell  off the bone. Very nice. It's not that loud, could be a good place for a first date. Service was good; though, listening to some of the other servers they seemed to be better offering specials and such. We did not get that treatment. Overall would go back again."}
{"text":"Everything was great and met the expectation I had walking in! I was greeted with a smile and, my server was timely and to the point. My glass was full, I was full, I left more happy than when I came in."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Have only had great food, service, atmosphere, drinks! Usually a wine drinker but the dirty martini was THE BEST!!! Reminds me of another restaurant we frequented in ATL, Ga. Starts w an \"H\" & ends w an \"N\". Could they be owned by the same?! I'm from the south and love the city of Charleston so how can it not be a winner, right?! Sadly, our friend had one special request to NOT add any seasoning to those scrumptious carrots but alas some was evident. They brought a generous portion to go which hopefully made up for this itty bitty \"oops\"! Must say the baby backs were mouth-watering good as usual & the hubs & I always split as portions are generous. I'm a BIG fan of their prime rib & daughter adores the filet. (Of course she does, as we are footing the bill!!) One more thing before you fall asleep..... we had reservations for first time which was expedited seating but typically that happen sign is lit outside  with \"immediate seating\"! Such a classy, romantic place which was bustling everywhere last nite!! My man says the management rocks!!!"}
{"text":"It has a comfortable, clubby interior.  Everything we ordered (burgers, roast chicken, kids meals) was really tasty and fresh.  Compared to other chain restaurants, I think the food here is a step above.  One thing that definitely stood out was the service.  Everyone was really friendly and attentive.  We were in for lunch and our final bill was very reasonable.  However, some of the items targeted for dinner (fish, prime rib) seemed pretty expensive for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Met our expectations and pushed beyond. For some reason the wife and I have not gone here for many years, more than I care to admit, but the menu stayed consistent, service exemplary, and still a great atmosphere. Mackenzie was a server, not once did our drinks run dry. All staff was very friendly and I wish the manager stopped to ask but she was busy actually helping keep tables fresh/clean. Highly recommend dinning here great date night dinner, get out the house and take that special someone out and enjoy a great meal and great company! We will be back sooner than later. Thanks Mackenzie for doing it right, it been a long time since we have had GOOD service!"}
{"text":"Another part of the chain but still good quality food, service and all you want for a reasonably priced meal at nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Took the family out to Charleston's over weekend and out of the five meals they all were delicious"}
{"text":"Great food Better than average service Glazed carrots are yummy Iced tea never got below 1/2 Portion size huge  Enjoy"}
{"text":"First time here and the last. Service stinks food was okay but service is everything I think there motto here is we don't like bothering our customers so if you like having ur cup empty and seeing your waitress twice and having to flag her down  the entire time then you will like this place by the way there were not busy. I won't bother coming back even if there was a different waitress."}
{"text":"Love this place, the best house salad and you get a bonus croissant, yummy! I have yet to have something on the menu that wasn't great! And the service is always on point!"}
{"text":"I would've given Charleston's 5 stars if it weren't for a few mishaps. We arrived around 4:25 and were promptly seated. Lighting was a bit low. Our waitress was very nice and quickly took our drink order. Our food and drinks were served in a timely fashion. We had a party of 4 and ordered baby back ribs(which were fall of the bone great) with baked beans, shrimp scampi, bison burger, and got the prime rib. The first mistake that was made was that the prime rib came rare when I ordered medium-rare. It was only seared on the outside. I told the waitress that that was not what I ordered and she took it back and came back out a few minutes later with a perfectly done prime rib.   After we ate, we were asked if we would like some desert. Two of us got the bread pudding and apple cobbler. The bread pudding was excellent, but the apple cobbler came out undercooked and had a floury taste to it. Our waitress acknowledged our dislike for the cobbler and promptly removed it from our bill, which was very nice of her.  Overall experience     4/5 Ambiance and décor 4/5 Service quality            5/5 Food quality(minus rib mistake) 5/5 Given the chance, I will return."}
{"text":"Oustanding food and service. Great pork chops and fresh fish.  The salad comes with homemade dressing which is exceptionally good. A warm fresh croissant come with the salad and was the best  I have had since N'awlins, as was the fish. The manager Michael came by to tell us our order would be out soon, and it was. Servers are attentive and very competent. Large portions come with a choice of sides, I substituted carrots and baked potato for the cole slaw and fries and they were very good. We travel often and look for above average restaurants, and this Charleston's is way above the usual American fare in most cities. Well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Had a free appetizer, flatbread pizza,really good.  Shared a rack of ribs with my husband.  They fell off the bone, mmmmm.   Very friendly service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here. The rigatoni bolonese was what I had and it was excellent. Service was top notch."}
{"text":"My husband and I agree. Our recent lunch at Charleston's in Mesa was literally the BEST lunch we've ever had!  Every single thing was absolutely perfect!  We started with the dip duo for an appetizer. It is jalapeño pimento cheese, guacamole, and tortilla chips. I substituted salsa instead of guacamole. If you like pimento cheese and can tolerate a little jalapeño spice, definitely get this dip. O.M.G!!!!!  For our entrees, I had the grilled chicken club sandwich on ciabatta (normally it comes on wheat) with shoestring french fries.  The sandwich is a a perfectly grilled chicken breast, bacon, tomatoes, melted cheese, avocado, and sprouts. Delicious!  I savored every bite, but could not finish the whole thing. My husband had a top sirloin steak and coleslaw. Because he prefers his steak very, very well-done, the chef visited our table to be sure he understood exactly how to prepare it. Of course, most customers (and definitely the chef) would think this steak temperature ruins the steak. Rather than judging, he took the time to speak to my husband to be sure that's what he wanted. It was a very nice touch. My husband said it was the best steak he's ever had. Not an ounce of fat to trim off. The coleslaw is a unique recipe that has cilantro and finely-diced, spicy pickles and thin strips of crunchy green cabbage in a creamy dressing. It was also delicious!  Unfortunately, we were way too full for dessert. Last, but not least, we were very pleased with the excellent service. Everyone from the hostess to the server and chef were lovely!  If you have the chance, we highly recommended the Mesa Charleston's!  We live out if state, but will make it a point to return!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Very friendly atmosphere and out waitress took good care of us. Food was also delicious and the portions were huge! Be careful when ordering that you don't overdo it! :) A manager came and greeted us after learning it was our first time here. We received a warm welcome and some coupons for next time, definitely left a good impression!"}
{"text":"Once again a delicious meal.  Kudos to the chef and his staff for always putting out such wonderful food.  One of us had the ribs (couldn't finish them so they came home).  A Ruben sandwich and the oven roasted chicken all had portions coming home as well.  One of those places you want to go to so you have leftovers. Attentive service, but Michael needs to lighten up a bit - dont be afraid to smile.  Show some personality.   Always wonderful food, service,  and atmosphere.  You'll never be disappointed.  Whatever you do, croissants are a MUST!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and were disappointed.  We ordered drinks and another waiter delivered them with 2 other drinks in his hand and spilled some of the other drinks on my wife's foot and all we got was \"opps\".  He did not return with a cloth or anything.  She ordered prime rib medium and received medium rare so she sent it back.  When she got it back you could tell it was nuked which made it tuff.  I ordered the catfish and the all crust pretty much fell off the fish before I could dip it in the tartare sauce.    Before when we were there the manager would work the room asking how things were and if he do do anything to make it better.  Never saw the manager.  We will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came for a date night and was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. I ordered the Filet with mashed potato and my wife ordered the Parmesan chicken. We both enjoyed our meal immensely. This will be a regular date night spot. We ordered a basket of  honey croissants to take home for later. Best part was dinner didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I've had two great meals here. I really enjoy their Reuben sandwich and I LOVE their cole slaw. Best slaw I've ever eaten and the Rueben comes with two ample dill pickle chunks. Our first time there we had a hot artichoke dip but didn't like that it was served with tortilla chips. Pita chips would have been a better choice. The hostesses are pleasant and the wait staff is attentive. I enjoy the brick and gas light decor and leather booth seating. It's a place you can take your mom."}
{"text":"Best chain restaurant in North Scottsdale. Ribs are great. Not up scale....but mid scale. Great dinner place. Our favorite is the ribs and sautéed mushrooms."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Dynamite shrimp appetizer was excellent. One person then had it for their meal.  Pork chops were tender and great flavor with a bowl of mushrooms( yummy). Salmon and Brussel sprouts was excellent!!! Our server was very good and professional. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We finally succumbed to 4 years of TV advertising...and are we glad we did!  This is our new favorite restaurant.  Went twice this weekend and loved the ambiance, the food and the service.  My wife tried the chicken fried steak and the chicken/avocado club sandwich and absolutely RAVED that they were 2 of the best dishes she's ever had.  I had the prime rib sandwich, which was very good but over-priced at $19 and the hickory burger.  There are still 6 - 8 other dishes on the menu we want to try, so 5-stars for the varied menu."}
{"text":"The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. We always order the prime rib and it's delicious. Our kids love the butter noodles. Definitely recommend Charleston's to friends and family."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday, 9/12/15 for my birthday with 11 other family members.  This is the first time I've been to a Charlston's.  The service was fantastic.  The food-fantastic.  The prices for what you get-fantastic.  DEFINITELY going back to this Charlston's location.  I had the prime rib-10 oz.  mixed vegetables and baked potato with butter only.  The waitress was very attentive.  Too back she's going back to Las Vegas this December and won't be around for my wife's birthday in March.  But, I told her to look for a White Castle up in Vegas.  She never heard of White Castle!!  Hope she enjoys.   Anyway, highly recommend this Charlston's."}
{"text":"Let me tell you this place is a five star stop the food is fantastic you can taste the love and care they put into it.  The service was above expectations I didn't have to ask for a thing management was friendly and informative. This was the first time I've ever eaten at a Charleston's and it will not be the last next time I'll even bring friends and family just to show this place off! In case you are wondering I couldn't finish all the food that came with my lunch."}
{"text":"This place is perfection, amazing food and great atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants! I wish I could give 6 stars"}
{"text":"I need some shrimp cargo please!  It's so rich and amazing especially with a margarita to wash it down...yum!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Excellent food and service for lunch last week. Very lively place, a little on the loud side. Food made up for it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Heard that Charleston had the best roasted chicken ever and I was craving it. So made may way there and the waitress recommended I try the chicken rib combo, OMG this was an incredible meal, they did not disappoint. Later I had one of the best Key lime pies ever for dessert! Wow, I will absolutely be a regular here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"2 stars - food only redeeming factor. Hostess staff was rude because of our lack of reservation. Can't find anywhere that a reservation is even suggested on a Saturday at 4:30... Ended up sitting in bar area that was overwhelmed (1 server) while main room was fairly empty with wait staff standing around waiting on nonexistent reservations. Won't return, the trouble isn't worth the pub fare."}
{"text":"First and last time here. I was told the chili was home made but it tasted like Kroger brand out of a can. My friend ordered a quesadilla and didn't like it and she was asked twice if she needed a to go box and replied with \"No, I didn't like it.\" GM  didn't even respond and when the same convo occurred between my friend and our server, his reply was \"No worries.\" Shouldn't HE be worried? He does work off tips.  Draft beers weren't even cold. Ugh. Not impressed one bit. I'd refer this establishment as an upscale Chili's, at best.   They seem to be accommodating to the handicapped though."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! The adults in my group got French dip, sirloin, and soup & salad. The sirloin was average, not bad. The kid's macaroni & cheese (penne) was a hit with my kids. The chicken and kale soup was light and pretty tasty.  The baked potato soup was really good. The croissants were delicious. Overall I would recommend going here. It worked for this group of out of towners!"}
{"text":"Our party of four, all order the Catfish and it was outstaniding. The breading on the Catfish was just right, it wasn't on thick like must restaurant do. The cocktails were mixed just right. The evening was just outstanding. If you want excellent comfort food, then go to Charleston's. The waitress wasn't in my face however she was always there wanting to know if we needed anything. We didn't have to look for her. Charleston's is first class!!"}
{"text":"Went to Charleston's last evening and had an amazing dining experience.  The food is consistently good, the service was great and even though there were small kitchen hicupps the waiter and manager more than made up for them.  If you have not tried their Chicken Piccata you need to.  It is tangy and lemony and the capers and artichoke hearts make it amazings good!    I would highly recommend this location and like usual- they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Family group of 9 celebrating 2 birthdays. We have been here before and the service was spotty and food inconsistent. Food ordered came out wrong for 2 people. The salmon and replacement salad was wrong too. After we paid the bill the server asked if celebrating anything. To late, it w have been nice to ask when we were seated.   Sorry Zoe I am not interested in filling out your Corporate paperwork on a complaint. You have the details to complete it. Thank you."}
{"text":"My husband and ordered the champagne chicken salad. On the menu the description indicated the salad consisted of greens, chicken, strawberries, pineapple, croutons, pecans, etc. Both salads were served to us without the pecans and croutons. When we asked the waitress about it she brought us two small bowls with a very small amount of minced pecan pieces. Very disappointed. For $18, I would expect a lot more!"}
{"text":"This Charleston's has made some great improvements (food and service) over the years.  One of the best and consistent things about this location is Mary Ellen.  Although not a manager, she sure should be one.  She puts a face on a faceless corporation.  This lady knows her business.  She is a quintessential professional.  There is quite a few young servers here.  As you would imagine, the service level correlates with the age/skill set.  We are always thrilled to get Mary Ellen as our server.  She is as kind as she is knowledgable about her business.  The food is good and if you're lucky to get Mary Ellen, the service will be excellent as well.  I'm not sure why Charleston's doesn't have all of their servers train under this woman."}
{"text":"Don't understand the negative reviews. Eat here once a month for several years and never had apoor meal or service.   Love their baked potato soup, chicken piccata, crossiants, salads and chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to come to this location and try it for quite awhile. Too bad we came the night we did, because, we were not impressed at all.  Food was not hot when it came out, our Server did not know any thing about the Tea that they carried. ,She had to be asked to refill our drinks more than once.  It just was not a pleasant experience. We so like the one in Chandler so much better. I do not think that we will return to this location. Maybe it was not a good day for them. But, now that I have tried it ,I cannot ever see a reason to return."}
{"text":"Here on holiday, had our dinner here.  The ambience here was lovely, felt like a high end restaurant and I honestly felt under dressed.  BUT, it was just me.  They didn't have a dress code and it was very enjoyable.  Having a lunch, he had a chicken sandwich and I had a cheeseburger and we both had fries.  The portions are a little big, we took some home for leftovers later.  The BIG HIGHLIGHT here for me is the KEY LIME PIE!!!!    This was the absolute best I've ever had and I've had them at the places you'd expect to be good like Grand Cayman Island and Sanibel Island Florida and this one blows them all away!!  If you need a carry out dessert, definitely try this just one time and you'll be hooked.  The waitress was very nice and helped with local information as we are from out of town."}
{"text":"Always my go to place.    I can always rely on Charlston's for a beautiful dinner ambience,  Great tasting food, Great service and restaurant cleanliness.  Last time I was tempted enough to eat dessert and tried the brownie and ice cream and was so happy it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My Cajun friend who says he knows his ribs, thinks Charleston's baby backs are pretty good.  The ribs certainly were tender and falling off the bone, though I was mostly concentrating on the okra side.  I love fried okra... and they give you alot!    My boyfriend got the prime rib sandwich, I thought it was going to be shaved meat... literally it's a steak in a loaf of bread.  I wish they gave us some horseradish, forget the bread... just like a steak dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends and family for delicious rib dinner. We all had the ribs with a side of carrots. Their carrots are the best I have ever tasted! A few of us had a salad which comes with a fabulous croissant. We were all super satisfied. I do miss their country fried steAk which is off the menu and has been replaced  witb a country fried chicken."}
{"text":"Croissants and bread pudding. That's the only reason I eat here, the rest is just details. Ok, the rest of the food is pretty good. I know in all my reviews I put a disclaimer about \"it's nothing AMAZING\" and this one is no exception. The atmosphere is dark and relaxing and at lunch time, it's always busy. Today I had the new chicken salad sandwich...meh. I should have stuck to their fish or steak selection. They know how to grill a steak or a fillet of fish. The chicken salad however was sad and disappointing. The bread was so coarse that it scraped the roof of my mouth, the chicken salad barely had any mayo and WAY too much red onion chunks. I won't be ordering that again. Other than that, I'm rarely disappointed with Charleston's and plan to devour more croissants and bread pudding. Those are a little piece of heaven on a busy day!"}
{"text":"Pretty good overall...we tried the chicken piccata and ciabatta chicken sandwich. Veggies were great and portions were perfect. Service was good, refills were there before you needed them, they checked up on you regularly, and everyone was extremely friendly. Welcoming, comfortable atmosphere--dark-ish, but enough light to read the menu (thankfully). Menu is only one sided (decent variety), back side is wines.  Will likely be added into the mix of choices in the area."}
{"text":"Been to a couple of Charleston's. Went to this location last Sunday. We were seated and told that \"Gabby\" would be right with us. 15 minutes passed and we were just about to walk out when a young gentleman came and said he noticed we didn't have drinks and he would be happy to get us started while we waited. He came back with the drinks and said our waitress would be right with us, unless we knew what we wanted, then he could just take the order and give it to her. So we did that. I took my 6 year old to the bathroom and noticed two female employees standing around chatting. After my daughter was done we walked passed them (still chatting) across the restaurant back to our booth. I pointed it out to my wife as they continued to chat. Somebody brought us our food, so that was cool.   Then someone came by and refilled my water. She was glad that one of my daughters pointed out the fly in my glass. The original guy who took our was very apologetic and went to get me fresh water and let the manager know.   Gabby came by and asked if we left room for dessert. Hmmmm  Then the manager came by to let us know they hadn't had a fly problem. Well that's good, you're not supposed to. Then he offered us a free dessert. I don't even like sweets.   Gabby came back and gave us our bill. It will be the last bill I ever pay to this location. Which is bad because my wife works across the street and she takes her employees there all the time and she was livid about the entire experience and also won't be going back.   I have two stars, cause the food was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Ate here today I hope that there is something better in Scottsdale Not that it was bad, but nothing special from the service to the food I'd say Skip It !"}
{"text":"I have come here for dinner twice now. Andrew was my waiter on both occasions and he is superb, an asset to Charlestons for sure. The first time I had the salmon it was mediocer. But my friend had the prime rib and said it was heavenly.  So I came back to give it a try. Indeed it was very good and cooked exactly as we ordered it. The side options were limited but good. I had the broccoli which was not over cooked (thank goodness). The key lime pie was good but I had no room left and brought it home for a late night snack."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places, we both had the filet. One baked potato and one garlic mashed potato plus a side honey carrots. All were great followed by coffee and the brownie &  ice cream dessert. Seems to be always good."}
{"text":"We've eaten here countless times over the last 16 years. Honestly, probably a thousand times. Charlestons is the Epitome of class, style, consistency and quality.  Small, yet delicious and well appointed  menu.  All of the Staff dresses the part and exudes class and professionalism.  I love the atmosphere, the ambiance, the music. My husband and I came here for dinner last weekend. We sat at the bar. I think I have taken for granted what a wonderful restaurant this is and I needed to take a moment to YELP about it.  The roasted chicken was fabulous as always, as was the filet and loaded baked potato. Thank you Charlestons for always impressing me.   PS; The corporate commercial is awful though:(((( It makes me think it's a cafeteria with the sing-song-y style Jingle."}
{"text":"Seven years in this valley and the majority of the steaks I have had at restaurants are lousy.  But this place impressed me... best steak dinner I have had in a restaurant in years!  A bit pricey, but if you want good service and a great steak, this place is a winner, IMHO."}
{"text":"Unique place. Local. Friendly. And decent prices. Worth one evening trip over. I would try again."}
{"text":"According to Yelp, this is considered an upscale steakhouse - I guess.  I didn't get a chance to try the steak because I came with the intentions on ordering catfish.  My partner and I stopped in late Saturday night after leaving a sip and paint party.  It was late, around 9:30 ish, they were closing in about 30 minutes and the place was empty with the exception of my partner and I and one other patron drinking at the bar.  The bartender was still very attentive although she was closing down shop.  We skimmed over the menu but knew we wanted catfish.  Everything looked scrumptious.  I ordered the catfish patter that came with 2 sides.  I went with the regular fries and cold slaw.  My partner ordered fried okra and mashed potatoes with his.  We received our meals within minutes of ordering.  The minute we finished our salad and croissants, the catfish was coming out and it was piping hot.  We added nothing to it, no salt, hot sauce, pepper, ketchup, nothing.  It was perfect!    The portions were huge!! We were able to eat off of our leftovers for 2 days, making 2 catfish sandwiches per person, from just 1 piece of catfish.  Wow!  That's how big they were.  The tartar sauce was out of this world good.  It's obvious they make all of their sauces in house because the dressing was scrumptious too. We did not order any drinks or dessert because it was already pretty late. Our bill was about $44 bucks.  We have every intentions on visiting Charleston's again for a nice date night dinner"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Charlestons probably more than 50 times.  Last night(March 4) was one of the worst.  We all ordered the same thing, Chicken Club Salad.  There was not one speck of egg, maybe 1 tiny piece of avocado and I couldn't find any bacon.  I feel like I paid $15 each for 3 dinner salads.  It was seriously disappointing and not what we expect from Charlestons.  We would have ordered dessert but all we wanted to do was leave.  Sad!"}
{"text":"We come here for lunch quite often. Attentive staff... great food. Their daily fish selection is pretty good, but I wish they'd bring back the Halibut. Sides and salads are plenty. Everything is seasoned to perfection. Food always arrives in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain restaurant however this is my old faithful place for lunch.  Great salmon salad the ribs are excellent..... honestly the best bread in town hands down!"}
{"text":"My favorite local place to eat . We always get good service and the food Yum! The grilled chicken avocado  sandwich with a baked potato is my favorite and the pickle on top are made in house . The steak is good also."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Charleston's before. I have seen the commercials on TV but never connected that this was the place I was seeing advertised. It was the girlfriends idea to come here on NYE before we hopefully went to a show at Gammage. So I called and made the reservations. Now I called sometime in November for the reservations and the person on the phone took all of my info and said \"it was down in the book\" but then I called the day of to confirm the reservation and the time and they didn't have a reservation for me. Uh oh. This might have been a problem but they took all of my info again and honored the lost reservation at the time I wanted. Nice save. When we arrived they had a booth all set for us. It is a very nice place. A little dark inside and old school but not old. Everything was well maintained and very clean. No holes in anything or dust anywhere. The booth was very nice. Plenty of room for two. There were a lot of people there, hey it is NYE. At first I joked with my girlfriend that we weren't old enough to get into this place given the average age of everyone inside was well over 65. But although it was busy the service did not suffer at all. Our waitress was very nice. Our water glasses never even got close to empty and we were checked on just enough. Not too much to be pushy and not completely ignored. My girlfriend, who had been here before, made all of the recommendations. We started out with their Cream Spinach Artichoke Dip. Wow was this good. So creamy. I could have eaten a whole other bowl of it. I think I am ruined on spinach artichoke dip from now on. Then on to the main course which of course had to be prime rib. This was cooked perfectly. Just the way I like it. It comes with creamy horseradish sauce which was good but I almost think the beef au jus they also give you was just a little better with it. I also got the mashed potatoes, on recommendation, and they were very good as well. Everything was just excellent. Service, food, everything. It may not be a five star restaurant but it deserves a five star review. Sure it is a little pricey but it was actually a little cheaper than I thought it would be. Plus it is worth it the price. You don't feel overcharged at all. The food is so good it is worth the price. We will definitely be back. Maybe not very frequently but we will be back."}
{"text":"All-around excellent experience.  Tender filet, all food served at perfect temperatures, great prompt service even on a busy night.   These folks seem to have their act well together."}
{"text":"Great food and always consistent, prime is always my go to or the ribs drinks are also very good!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour. Appetizers and beer.  The Shrimp Cargot was divine.  Wait staff uplifting and efficient."}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing. I loved the dim lights and relaxing atmosphere.  My husband had the ribs and chicken..it fell off the bone. I had the salmon..fresh and delicious.  My kids were totally happy..best Mac n cheese and steak."}
{"text":"I come here for their ribs. I've tried ribs and barbecue in a lot of places. This place is on top of my list. Their side dishes are great as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic place I had a wonderful time. The service was quick and the food was delicious! I especially enjoyed the spinach dip. Our waiter was sweet and gracious. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!   One of the same owners of the former \"Houston's\" restaurant.   The prime rib was mouthwatering!   The beans were to die for.   This place has a great feel to it.   The service possible needs to be upgraded a little.   Two managers walked by our table a few times and never said anything to us.   We had to ask them to stop and check to see how we were doing."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give them a four.  Jonathan was great.  We ate outside and enjoyed the Arizona nights.    The prime rib was good.  It came out medium but should have been medium well.  The manager did well and brought out a new plate of prime rib and sides.  I was impressed by that!   I would recommend the ribs and the baked beans.  The gumbo was a no go.  The keylime was great!"}
{"text":"Wow, was in the mood for a steak and I have to say I have had a lot prime.rib, this was.one of the best cuts I have had. Great place, good prices, great service."}
{"text":"Went off of the reviews on yelp and found them somewhat accurate so here is mine. We went for lunch. 1 appetizer, 2 dinners and 3 beers =$66..I guess not to bad.  Service was great! Food - We had the spinach dip and both of us got the Chix and Rib plate. Portions were huge, a plus. Chicken was very salty and ribs were, in both our opinions over-sauced. I don't like digging through sauce to find meat and the flavor of the meat was covered up by the super rich, sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Charleston's is an upscale-style steakhouse that has met my expectations both times I've been there on visits to the Mesa, Arizona area. The dimly-lit hardwood table ambiance is appropriately satisfying, and service has always been prompt and courteous.  That means yes, they will keep your iced tea glass full.   They have a relatively huge menu offering many different dishes from salads to burgers and fries to choice cuts of steak.  The groups I've been with have ordered the breadth of these offerings and they all looked and tasted good.  Most recently someone got a chicken salad that was both huge and beautiful. I got the Parmesan-encrusted chicken with angel hair pasta that was appropriately crunchy and flavorful.  It came with a side salad that had mini-caprese mozzarella and tomatoes that were quite tasty.  Someone else ordered the shrimp scampi with pasta, which also looked huge and delicious.  If you have kids, there are many good choices on the kids menu that are relatively inexpensive, but the portion sizes remain large enough to fill older kids. The ribs and mac and cheese were favorites on our last visit. The meals also come with a drink and dessert. I typically impose a mandatory dessert sharing-with-the-adults rule and there was plenty there for everyone.  They also have \"twisty\" activity kits for the kids which will keep them busy and are a bit different than the traditional crayon and coloring activities offered by most restaurants.  Overall you will be paying a bit more if you eat at this restaurant, but I would say this is one place where the additional cost is worth it. Four solid stars."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go if you enjoy sitting at your table for 30 minutes with no one taking your order and checking in on you.   I apologize to Michael if I interrupted any deep conversation he was having with the line cook when I requested someone to come take my order.   Food was ok I guess."}
{"text":"Always enjoy dining at Charleston's!! The chicken picatta is simple delectable! Pleasant selection of wines to go with any menu item! House salad is a great starter with a freshly made croissant! Very comfortable venue and the wait staff sun to please without being intrusive!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect on our first visit here.   Excellent service and food.   We shared the shrimp cargot.   Hubby had the filet and I had the parmasean coated chicken... Instead of angel hair pasta I had perfectly cooked vegetable medley.    The patio was the perfect place to enjoy this delicious meal."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch about a week ago with my boyfriend and I was slightly skeptical at first.  I got the burger and he got the shrimp scampi. Our waiter was helpful, considerate, and always quick to get us more water. The food was spot on and absolutely cooked to perfection. Will definitely be returning in the near future!!"}
{"text":"We love this place and have never had a bad meal. Everything is exceptional from salads to sandwiches to meals. However, last time we dined here we had a poor experience. We were a party of 6 and a baby and were seated at a very strange table backed up to a pony wall type thing with a pillar so we were all seated on the same side of the table practically which made it hard for talking. Our waitress (Alex I believe her name was) was terrible. I don't say this often! Very unfriendly and rude, didn't check in with us and slow. She brought our dessert to us with all of our dinner plates still on the table. We asked for dessert plates and by the time she brought them, we had finished dessert because it took so long, still with our dinner plates and food still in front of us. When we told her we no longer needed the plates, she walked away annoyed. We will still be back for the awesome food but as a former server, I wanted to notate how terrible the service was - Especially for a special birthday in the family."}
{"text":"They always have awesome food never been disappointed. Fried Chicken salad, Chicken Picada, Chicken Fried Steak, River are some of my favorites! Kevin is a great server. Jena is a great Manager and makes sure everything is just right."}
{"text":"We always come here for the great food. Chips and salsa were always a good starter until they just recently changed the recipe. Please go back to the original, they were much better....."}
{"text":"We regularly visit this restaurant because of the friendly service, tasty food and excellent happy hour food options. We love the cheesy and buttery Shrimp Cargo appetizer that is served with toasted bread. The Chicken Club Salad is my favorite main course. It comes with one of their warm, soft and delicious croissants."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the Grandparents and feel compelled to write a review. I don't normally review chain restaurants, for obvious reasons, but Charleston's is a touch above the rest, and my 4 star rating is a comparison to other chain restaurants.   I've been here many times and really have liked everything I've had. From the salads, to the soups, to the roasted chicken I had last night, everything has met and exceeded my expectations. I especially love the croissants and often we ask for basket for the table.   The service is great as well, really friendly waitstaff, who ensure your order is taken promptly, you get refills when needed, and your food is serviced hot. All in all a great chain restaurant amongst many that are disappointing."}
{"text":"Great steak and great atmosphere. I'll choose this over other chain steak houses. Worth the price"}
{"text":"Consistently one of the best places to eat. And that Ultimate Margarita is awesome. Don't have more than 2."}
{"text":"Absolutely great. We've never been here before and just happened upon this place so we decided to give it a try. Everything was great from the food to the service. Absolutely recommend it and the chicken fried chicken fried chicken."}
{"text":"We went to Charlestons late Saturday night and ordered a little bit of everything. The quacamole was delicious but I don't see why they put it on shredded lettuce because that sort of ruined the consistency of the quac for me. The baked potato soup is always perfection. The steak had great flavor, we ordered it medium and it was more medium well but still tasty. The server was attentive but not overwhelming and the manager stopped by to thank us for coming in. We always enjoy our experiences at all of the Charlestons locations and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This review is really 31/2 stars. Myself my wife and our 2 daughters (8&9)were visiting from Southern California. Went here on a Saturday night for My daughters 8th birthday. Called the day of and got their  first available reservation for 7:15pm. Got seated right at 7:15. The hostess was young nice and presentable. There is nothing overly special about this place. Being from Los Angeles our expectations for a steakhouse are pretty high. This was good just not really good. Prices are reasonable. The drinks were pretty good. Their selection of wine was meek. Even my daughters said that my wife's steak that she grills up at home was much better. My wife had the ribs (because there selection of fresh fish was not to be desired ) and those were pretty good. I actually enjoyed her ribs better than my steak. My NY strip which was the special was a little fatty. I don't think that we will be back again."}
{"text":"We started with spinach artichoke dip which was so good! It was a must have.  I had the shrimp scampi,  which was the best I've ever had. My husband got a Ruben sandwich,  he loved it. It was a quiet atmosphere,  service was great and it wasn't too expensive. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"It took me two years but I finally tried something beyond the spinach dip and prime rib!!! The bbq ribs are wonderful. Tender, perfectly cooked and really good bbq sauce. I have never had bad service here and the food is always perfect. Charleston's impresses me everytime I go. I even stop for takeout for dinner sometimes and just get a spinach dip. It is pricey but for great food and consistently good service it is worth it."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted with smiling faces welcoming you to Charleston's.  My waiter was courteous and friendly.  My iced tea was never allowed to be more than half way gone.  Yes...this waiter was on it!  The Caesar Salad was delicious but the Croissant that came with it was to die for!  I ordered the Hawaiian Steak with Garlic Mashed Potato & Glazed Carrots.  The steak was THE best I'd ever had.  The flavor is like no other.  The garlic potatoes were great but the glazed carrots were even better.  Who would ever think that veggies could ever be so sinfully scrumptious?!  My whole meal was one the most pleasant ones I'd had in a long time.  The atmosphere is classy but not stuffy.  It's very inviting and everyone makes you feel welcomed.  I'm a huge fan of this place!"}
{"text":"We were seated as soon as we got here at 6:45 PM on a Friday night.  That was surprising to me considering how packed the parking lot was.  The atmosphere was AMAZING! !!!  The waitress was nice and efficient but not too overly friendly.  She wasn't one who stood by the table and chatted.  Being that this is the first time here, I'm not sure if that is a requirement of the establishment.  It didn't seem to be a \"noisy\" place.  She checked on us promptly so she gets high marks for service. :)  The food tasted good.  It came out promptly and was cooked correctly but was nothing to write home over.  It was a nice change of pace and overall,  we had a nice dinner but I couldn't help wishing we had went to Texas or Piggley's.  It just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"We went to Charleston's solely for the bread pudding & ended up leaving after a wonderful dining experience. The hostess seated us immediately upon arrival (unexpected at 7:30pm on a Friday night) & our waitress came by to take our drink and appetizer order soon after.  After browsing pictures on Yelp, it pretty much went without say that we were getting the Shrimp Cargot. It came out so piping hot that we had to wait a couple of minutes before digging into the delicious-ness. The escargot dish was filled with 6 succulent shrimp in a garlic butter sauce & was covered in havarti cheese; it was served with 2 pieces of garlic toast. The only qualm I had about this was that there wasn't enough garlic toast in ratio to the shrimp, however we enjoyed what was served.  Upon recommendation of our waitress, we ended up getting the Ribs & Oven Roasted Chicken combo, split. The Oven Roasted Chicken was by far the biggest disappointment. It was lacking flavor & any kind of pizzaz and was covered in a thick layer of fat which was highly unappetizing. I had to pick it all off. The ribs on the other hand were actually cooked really well and the mashed potatoes & baked beans were tasty. The portion size was definitely enough for two people to split (you may have leftovers depending on how hungry you are, if you get an appetizer, etc). The best part was that they brought everything out on two separate plates so we could just get to eating immediately.  Finally, we put in our order for dessert! Yes, I had VERY high expectations and yes, I was satisfied. We were presented with a beautiful piece of bread pudding that was topped with a Bourbon Whiskey sauce. When I pierced my spoon in the pudding & grabbed a bite, I immediately knew it was hot hot hot! Steam filled the air. After only the first bite, I was converted. It was the perfect amount of bread, cinnamon, and sauce but a bit heavy on the raisins; I think those could be lessened since it did start making the bread pudding seem overly sweet towards the end. The size was big so I got to take a little bit less than half home for the next day!  Charleston's doesn't have a very big menu but the choices offered seemed great. The service was also pretty on par so I'd recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I sat in the bar area.. My original waiter was horrible to be honest. I think he came to my table twice. The shrimp pasta on the other hand along with the bread was so good. I've been living by this place for years and this was my first visit. I would try it again. I probably wouldn't sit in the bar area though."}
{"text":"Came in just to see Jen V. Food is fantasric. Ambiance is upscale but environment is still family friendly."}
{"text":"This spot was picked as good spot for a business lunch/meeting by someone from the area.  By the outward appearance, I am thinking it was something like your standard national chain restaurants filled with many choices of mediocre food.  But I think this definately a step up or maybe two.  The service was solid from the hostess at the beginner and then our waitress was on a mission to make sure our drinks didn't ever get all the way down before they were refilled - Awesome!  The salads looked great but I didn't want to try to shovel that much green into my pie-whole while talking with people.  I ordered the french dip and outside of being a little bit soggy, it is the best french dip I have had since 2013!"}
{"text":"This trip just did not seem to go right from the start.  I made the reservation because the better half wanted a certain sandwich.   We got there on time and there was a huge crowd sitting next to us.  We were fortunate to get our order in before they did.   I ordered the salmon with carrots.  It was pretty good. My better half got her sandwhich and it was a tad cold.  She ate it knowing that any remakes will be behind a huge group of people sitting next to us.  We told the server and he took it off the tab.  They did a good job.  I did like the food, but feel it was a bit over priced though.  I will come back and try something else on the menu next time."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants.  Dark And cozy vibe with comfortable booths, reminds me of Midwestern restaurants. Salads, soups and fresh baked croissants drizzled with honey are fantastic! Cheeseburgers, country fried steak are delicious. Service is always exceptional. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Charleston's.  This restaurant sees us for special occasions, but also for important business meetings with VIPs; this was the occasion.  I had the 20 ounce prime rib delicious.  The night before I had the 16 ounce.  I could eat here every night."}
{"text":"Only good things to say about Charleston's. I have never had a bad meal there... in fact, they've all been delicious. The service is extremely attentive..... and their staff does a great job with team work. The managers work right alongside their staff... which is a nice change. Their drinks are great, too. LOVE Charleston's.... I'd go there over Texas Roadhouse (across the parking lot) ANY day."}
{"text":"This is NOT, I repeat, not a BBQ place at all, however, I have not had better ribs in my life.  It is the only BBQ item on the menu along with a side of their BBQ beans, this is by far the best ribs I have ever had.  I also like to substitute a salad for the fries, so the meal is not too haevy and you can get a half slab as well, but then you only get one side, which is ok too.  I also love most of their menu, but I keep coming back for the ribs."}
{"text":"Second trip to Charleston's was again perfection. Service was on point, timing of appetizer, salads, main entrees was smooth. We had ribs that fell off the bone, the best Ruben Sandwich I have ever had and flatbread to start. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good place and we will go back.  The croissants are to die for, but everything else we had was good. The atmosphere is very loud and it is a bit like a sports bar.  Our server was a little stressed, which caused her to be a little short at the beginning, but she settled in and was fine.  Biggest disappointment was the lack of choices on the menu.  Couple of steaks, couple of salads, some chicken options but that was it.  No real seafood options, no pasta.  I liked what I had, but wanted more variety."}
{"text":"Usually eat here twice a month with our family. Have always felt taken care of until tonight. Waited a longer time than was told (it's a weekend that happens), but when the 4 top sat before us gets sat at a 6 top booth and our party of 5 gets sat at a 4 top with a metal conference room chair, while there is still another empty 6 top booth. For as much money that you spend here, I would expect better service and seating arrangements. Losing favor with this long time family tradition."}
{"text":"Ive oreded from here to go several times and amost every time i get somthing wrong i have told them Several time im extremally allergeic to bean amd i order a sanoran hot dog and this mothhherrr fuuuckker putsss beans on it like i just said 2 minutes ago im allergeic and still nothing this is bullshit."}
{"text":"Hi visit Scottsdale from Boston every year to visit family, and one request is that I get to Charlestons!  Dinner is great. Lunch is great. Service is great. Superb family atmosphere!  At one point we had a party of 10 ranging in ages from 4 to 84. Everyone loved their meals. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We recently visited the Charleston's Restaurant in Chandler/Ahwatukee and had a nice time.  We opted to sit in Lounge Seating versus Dining [where the Service left a little something to be desired - Hence the 3 stars] and had an appetizer that was to die for - Shrimp Cargot - and for dinner we both selected the Salmon since that was the primary reason why we went there to begin with - Per my Papa's recommendation.  In true fashion, he was absolutely right about the 'awesome-ness' of the Salmon's seasoning, moistness and overall charring execution...Delicious!  We will definitely return for this meal time and time again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Coukdnt ask for a better experience then what we had... This is our new favorite!!!!! Honestly the TV commercials are right... This place is all about the customer..& the food...Becky are server was outstanding....."}
{"text":"I would give four stars, but they don't have a good appetizer selection.  Otherwise, this place is delicious.  I do confess, I come for the beef dip sandwiches which are pricey, but worth it (and big so you can share).  The salads are fresh and chock full of great ingredients with delicious housemade dressings (and their signature honey croissant which is always freshly made, not out of the oven).  Service has always been excellent too.  I am just sorry I took so long to try this place out, I think the name and location might have something to do with it.  Charleston's sounds like a southern fish place maybe and it's located behind Carraba's.  In any case, trust me, this place is very good."}
{"text":"Good Food. Good Service. Romantic atmosphere. Took the family (kids = 1 and 3) for NYE had a very early reservation. Tried for 545pm but told only option was 4pm. We were one of 5 tables at that time and when we left at 520 it was still pretty open. With the low customer volume at the time we had great service. Really good with the kids. The food came out as ordered and tasted wonderful."}
{"text":"Great place for work lunch with tables that accommodate larger groups.  Our server Stratton  was kind and attentive and went out of his way to suggest ideas for our very diverse group.  One of us is vegetarian, one on a low carb diet and one who only eats certain types of meat.  You would think that would make any waiter run for the hills.  But Stratton took it in stride and suggested tasty dishes that fit the bill for everyone.    They are known for being able to get you in and out pretty quickly during lunch , but we never felt rushed and actually ended up eating and hanging out for a little while longer to have our business meeting.   It's a nice touch when they open the door for you upon arrival.  Makes you and those you are with feel just a bit more special.   Will return for after work events as well!"}
{"text":"Where oh where to begin!!! This place kills it every time! The food here is Sooo good. Both times I've left full and extremely satisfied. First time we came here we ordered the shrimp cargot, I wasn't sure what to expect but the description said garlic butter and havarti cheese so I was intrigued...it has to be the most amazing little appetizer I've ever had the pleasure of eating!!! If you love shrimp, do yourself a solid and try this, you won't be disappointed. My husband had a huge entree salad and it came with an amazing croissant roll. I would know, I kept asking for little bites :) I had the ribs and chicken that was like 3 meals in itself, Super good and heated up perfectly the next day. I also tried the peach billini at the recommendation of a friend and it was strong and good! The second time I had the chicken fried steak and the Husband had the pork chops. Both very solid meals and very tasty!  If you're a key lime pie lover, welcome home. It's very good and the crust is the kind with the nuts crushed in it. It has homemade whipped cream on top...need I say more?? :)"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was horrible.  The manager was immature and rude the server was nice but couldn't keep our drinks filled.  We were there for 3 hours took an hour just to take our order.  Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Been here before, we're usually here when family is in town. The first time, we all left satisfied. The burger I had was not only the largest burger I've ever seen/eaten, but was also worth every bit of its moderate price. The portions are very filling, but arent huge either. The service is slightly above average, the servers are nice, and it wasn't the sort of \"staged\" niceness you might find at some restaurants. Nothing wrong in terms of service quality. Overall, Charleston's is a great restaurant, and is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but felt obligated to post after my wife and I spent the last 24hours vomiting and pooping. We had the Grilled Chicken Club and a French Dip. Thank God we got our 20month old a grilled cheese. My guess is we had contaminated sprouts or undercooked chicken on the club. My wife and I split sandwiches so could have been undercooked prime rib I suppose. Either way we will never be going back."}
{"text":"This was my wife and I first visit. What a pleasant treat for lunch. Service was impeccable and the food was amazing. The cost was reasonable and will be returning again soon!!"}
{"text":"Charleston's is a little pricey but I come back for the Walt's chicken salad. The chicken fried steak is great."}
{"text":"Went here january 2011. Decent service. 20 minutes from order to delivery to the table. Reasonable prices. No complaints really. Nice looking place inside, looked clean."}
{"text":"Ooooo this place is fancy! I've been coming to this shopping plaza for what seems forever and I had never dined at Charlestons!   We stopped by for a little early lunch (11:30) and they had just opened. The hostess quickly opened the door for us as soon as she saw us walking up and kindly greeted us.  She walked us back to our table and there were people already eating. Our sever came over right away and took our drink orders. We looked over the menu and everything sounded so good!   We ended up ordering a Cesar salad with a potato soup ($14) and a cheeseburger with French fries. They have a different soup everyday of the week, but they do have the potato soup available everyday.   There were a lot of servers working at this time so they made sure there was no trash sitting on the table. As soon as they saw an empty plate or unwanted trash they would quickly come on over an pick it up. Thanks:)  Okay the food? My cheeseburger was SOOOO GOOD. The meat was grilled perfectly and was seasoned well. The French fries were crunchy and had definitely just been made. The salad tasted so fresh and the dressing was great! The potato soup, UMMM YUMMM! The soup was so good!!!! Oh and the croissant that came with the salad was amazing! So flaky and buttery, it's a must!   Everyone we encountered was friendly and the service was great! The food was delicious and we enjoyed our lunch. We will definitely be back sometime soon.   We spent close to $40 for two drinks, one salad with a soup, and a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Customer service trumps, so I must downgrade my rating with this addendum which I failed to post when this happened, at least 8 months ago, if not more. More likely it was last year.  It's now Sept 2011.  I happened to see an ad and thought, my positive review needs updating and sharing on FB, twitter, etc.    With almost every frequent visit here, we order at least 1 margarita, which yields 2 glasses from the shaker.  We dined in the restaurant over the bar this time and found the shaker only gave up 1 glass.  We tell the waiter, after all, we're ordering meals as well.    The waiter  consults the manager, who then eyes both of us while discussing this, before approaching our table.  He very condescendingly begins with speaking loudly, as if we were being reprimanded.  We tell him that we've ordered these margaritas for YEARS and it's always been a 2 glass drink.  He exclaims loudy still, that he is happy we informed him because the bartenders have been  making them wrong and he would be sure to have them make the drinks correctly with the right amount from now on!  There was no the customer is right, obligatory apology, no offer to make the drink as we've always had it served, no removing it from the bill, not a single offer to make it right for the customer.  We weren't asking for a free meal, nothing outrageous.  We asked that the drink we paid for, which if you think about it, are pricey-- for what you receive.  Not only do we NOT get a single word in the way of I'm sorry this happened, we are yelled at so every other table nearby turns to look and listen.  We weren't embarassed by that but somewhat surprised that he would make a specatcle,  in order to make it appear that we were unreasonable to the other customers, a weekend crowd.   What fool that gave him the title of manager?  tsk tsk, too bad.  We dine out for maybe 60 meals per month, who knows$, maybe more.    Needless to say, we haven't been back in to spend our money and we never will. Years of dining there and all that wasted  money.  There are far too many other restaurants with fantastic delicious food and tasty drinks PLUS FRIENDLY, accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Worst beer selection I have seen anywhere. If you don't want domestic Or Mexican you are pretty much out of luck. Menu somewhere between Applebee's and Outback, just priced higher. Generally disappointing and not worth your time."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a steak and salad.  I am so delighted to find this place.  It has a great speakeasy feel usually found in downtown areas, awesome grown-up Christmas blues and jazz, just the right amount of attention from the bartender and all of this makes the price so reasonable. I will be back often."}
{"text":"OMG...after reading the reviews, I just had to check it out. The croissants really did melt in my mouth. I could've just had a few baskets of those for dinner and would've been happy...but I had to try the suggested champagne chicken salad, and the review was right! Yummy! Of course I was dipping my fork onto other dishes at my table. The BBQ ribs were fall off the bone delish. The garlic mash potatoes were great...and I'm not a potato person. The veggie side was good too...not overcooked like a lot of restaurants. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"horrible place. i went there with my mom... and was amazed that in 2016 there are still restaurants with NO menu options for vegetarian partons. also the drinks were so weak, i suspect they had no alcohol in them. no thanks, i will not be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in while in Phoenix, having no idea this was a chain resto. We were extremely impressed with the atmosphere, food and service. Service in particular was excellent. Our young man server was very sweet and pleasant. Yes, it's a bit older and family oriented, but the roomy seats and good acoustics provided a private, good for conversation, feel to our dinner. I had a huge chicken salad so good I could have it every day. My peeps all had ribs which they loved.  Dear Charleston's,  Come to New York!"}
{"text":"Fabulous meal and excellent service.  First-time and I'll be back. Wine, coconut shrimp and grilled chicken salad with a tasty croissant all delicious.  Prefer my chicken hot but I know to ask next time."}
{"text":"Dave Hudson's favorite place to go.  Key lime pie is a must, don't forget to make room for the pie."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, and very clean.  Friendly staff.  The atmosphere said that jazz or standards should be playing, but instead, they seemed to have found a copy of \"Greatest Hits of the 90's,\" so it was odd to have \"Mmm-Bop\" by Hanson playing while eating at a borderline-upscale restaurant.  I'd go back, but only if they promise not to bombard me with the Spice Girls. ;)"}
{"text":"I must say this place was great!!! I came here on a Yelp review and this place was awesome. We went to the bar. Matt was the best bartender so far!!! The food was great and he made great suggestions for food, drinks and dessert!!! We will be back. Don't forget the dessert the cheesecake was to die for!!!Thanks again for a great time"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we felt ignored by the staff.  We had to flag down servers for drinks and condiments.  The manager spent most the time we were there chatting with friends at the bar and watching the game.  This was not our first visit but it was our last."}
{"text":"The crossiants are my favorite!! This is a great little neighborhood spot my fam has been frequenting for years.  They are amazing at accommodating special occasions.  I threw my dad's 68th birthday here and everything was perfect ... And surprisingly affordable! I highly recommend the pork chops and prime rib.  Great place for a cute date night or romantic dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for dinner with our 8 month old baby.  I wasn't sure what to expect after I called and made reservations. The lady I spoke with didn't seem friendly at all.  Once we arrived, we waited about 5-10 minutes for our table to be cleaned and they added a high chair our baby.  We got seated and our waiter was very prompt and came by to ask us for drinks.  Our drinks came pretty quick. We ordered our food and starters. I got a Caesar salad, which came with a small croissant. That croissant was like butter. They drizzled a sweet sauce over it which was like heaven.  The croissant was warm and crispy and soft on the inside. So yummy.  The salad was okay.   Like any other Caesar salad. The dressing was perfect though. Not too much or too little. My husband got the soup of the day, which was the tortilla soup. It was savory and delicious. He finished the entire cup. He also ordered the shrimp-escargot. Forgot the name of it. It was really good. Escargot styled shrimp with butter and melted cheese. Sooo delicious.   We waited quite a bit for our food. But when it arrived, it was massive. We were so full from the other food that we ate only half of our plate. I ordered the ribs and chicken combo, very good. The ribs are coated in a BBQ (I prefer my ribs dry).  My chicken, I didn't taste it, I was too full.  My daughter enjoyed it though.  My husband ordered the 14oz boneless ribeye, had it cooked medium.  It was surprisingly good. My husband is quite the cook when it comes to steaks and ribs.  The steak had a firewood taste which made it taste better. And his potato was so good.  We ordered dessert to go but it came with ice cream so our waiter brought the ice cream out and saved the brownie for later. He was so sweet, he doubled our scoops because he wanted to see if we could finish it all.  inside joke there.  But we did manage to finish it all.  All in all, great place for couples, groups, and kids. The crowd is older folks, maybe retirements, CEOs, etc.  We would come back if we are ever in this area again."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and great service. I ordered prime rib. It was above average. House salad was good. Baked potato was too. Hubby ordered chicken fried chicken. The breading was thick and too much"}
{"text":"Really pulled a douche bag move by coming here at 9:45pm when they close at 10:00, but everything was closed except for fast food places, in which we didn't feel in the mood for. The hostess didn't give us any attitude and sat us...It was super dark, but had comfy booths.   Andy was our waiter and he had such a great attitude, we apologized for coming in so late, but he assured us that we were fine. The salad was good, but kind of small, the buttery croissant that accompanied it, however is tasty. Hubs got porkchops and I got the chicken soup. Not bad, we ended up talking and laughing with Andy about the restaurant industry...too bad the bar was closed, I wanted to see if he wanted to drink with us."}
{"text":"Is it just me, or does this restaurant's decor just scream \"If you are eating here, you must qualify for social security and an early bird dining discount!\"  I felt like I was definitely out of my element (ahhh it is nice to be young still!).  Luckily, I had brought my parents along for the meal, so they fit in just fine.  The food was pretty good, considering it is a chain restaurant, but there was only one meal that was really worth writing home about.  Ahhhhhhh Chicken Fried Steak!  It was topped with an amazing green chile gravy.  I could take a hot bath in that delicious stuff... mmm!   My meal probably could've served a family of four, especially with the heaping side of chipotle mashed potatoes!  That pile of spuds was as big as a softball!  Not that I'm complaining!   The other meals were not quite as memorable... a salad... a sandwich... nothing that stood out (obviously, I can't remember the details!).  All I know is that I'm glad I'm the one who ordered the chicken fried steak.  Let's be honest - you can never really go wrong with that entree anywhere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. When we walked in, it seemed as though we were very underdressed but don't be scared away, their motto is \"the very best in casual dining\".  Brittney was our server and she was very good at her job. Very personable, spoke articulately and provided great recommendations. She refilled our drinks promptly and without needing to ask, she pre-bussed our table and delivered our food quickly from the time we ordered (hats off to the kitchen, too!)  The food was phenomenal. I ordered chicken fried chicken which came with a (chipotle-type?) sauce, glazed carrots and mashed potatoes. All of it was to die for. Amazing. Those whom I was dining with ordered a standard cheeseburger with French fries which was also very good as well as a turkey bacon club sandwich with coleslaw and that too was as fresh and delicious as it could have been.  Josh, who must have been a manager, came to our table, shook our hands, introduced himself to us and offered us two free appetizer cards which we gladly accepted. He welcomed us to Charleston's (as he knew it was our first time) and offered his personal assistance if we had any questions or concerns. Bravo, Josh. That type of managing is what business owners would drool over. It is hard to come by and you are a commodity. Job well done. Really!  All in all, an incredible dining experience in a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. We were very impressed with every aspect of this restaurant from the service to the food, it all was a five star dining experience. We'll be back, perhaps tomorrow. Yep.. It was THAT good."}
{"text":"I won some gift certificates at my school's raffle, and never having eaten here before, my husband and I decided to check it out. We were both quite hungry, so we ordered the croissant appetizer. They were under-baked, greasy, and drizzled with honey- both unexpected and disappointing. Hubby's clam chowder was full of grit and my salad was drenched in dressing, topped with a handful of chopped mushy tomato, and also full of grit. The grit police must have been on vaycay. Hubby ordered the prime rib sandwich (which is one of his favorites at Houston's) and it turned out to be a full slab of nearly tasteless meat which was poorly trimmed and ribboned with tough membranes on a lame toasted roll. He would have had to tear into it like a Neanderthal to eat it like a sandwich, so he ended up eating as much as he could stand with knife and fork. The au jus tasted like bouillon- and super strong at that. My entree was far better- a tender and perfectly cooked fillet of beef (although I had ordered the less expensive sirloin) with a delicious baked potato with all the trimmings. I ended up giving him about 1/3 of my steak since I felt so badly for his disaster of a meal. When we complained to the manager, he offered us more gift certificates, and we turned them down. You, too, should just say no to this dark, inexplicably crowded, disaster of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Our family eats here everytime we come to Scottsdale. Food is good as is the service."}
{"text":"My sister, father and I went in for lunch today and were treated like royalty!  My dad is a WWII veteran and he had his hat that has WWII Veteran on it.  Every person that worked there shook his hand and thanked him for his service.  They also took care of our bill!  It really warmed our hearts!   Thank you Mr. Mike Jukich, your restaurant is a very classy establishment!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Food was amazing and service was outstanding we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Houston's/Hillstone alternative.  We've eaten here many times and it's almost always a great experience.    The Perfect Margarita IS perfect.  I never would have put olives in a margarita but it so completely works.    On this past visit, my cheeseburger was overcooked and they happily took it back and fired a new one.    Service is generally impeccable.  Although, we have noted that they seem to have a fear of letting any glass be less than 3/4's full.  As soon as you've consumed *any* of your drink, you will have another glass on the table.  I find this amusing.    Great place although it does tend to be a bit loud when it's busy."}
{"text":"Followed other yelpers and had the ribs, salad and baked potato soup. Ribs were a huge hit. Baked potato soup was delicious and very filling. Croissant was also delicious. The service was awesome. Your cup will never be empty!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I ordered the center-cut fillet, medium-rare+ and not only did the waiter understand what I meant, it came out perfectly cooked.  The coleslaw on the side was great too.  Cilantro in the slaw makes a perfect touch.  Had the Keylime pie for dessert.   Was very good, but too big for me to finish on my own (great for sharing)."}
{"text":"This restaurant just got a very bad report from the Dirty Dinning Report from channel 5.  I ate there once and vowed I would never go back.  I have not.  This restaurant is worse than it's neighbor Texas Road House that actually have rats running through the kitchen and dinning areas.  Texas is also full of biting bugs.  Every time I eat at Texas I get sick but  ad-least their sickening food tastes good.  Charleston's serve cold stakes and won't even heat them up .  The charge for my one and only dinner at Charleston's came to over 100 dollars.  The steaks were so bad, so cold and tough it was worse than Texas Road House with the rats, bugs and food that makes me sick."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite lunch spots for a long time! They have just about everything on the menu from soup, salads, sandwiches, pasta, to meats and seafood dishes and I've never had a thing I didn't like!   Sone of my personal favorites:  - the glazed carrots. SO good. They're cooked and glazed with a maple type sauce. They kind of remind me of thanksgiving sweet potatoes but just carrots instead of sweet potatoes  - the baked potato soup. The best I've ever had. It's so creamy and potatoey and perfect with the melted cheese on top mmmmm  - the croissants!!!! They come with all the salad dishes but if one doesn't come with your meal, order a basket for the table. They're warm, flakey, drizzled with honey and SOOooooOoOOO good."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere.  This was my first time going to this particular restaurant. So I played it safe and ordered the turkey burger which was good.  I really enjoyed the fries as well.  The wait was short and the wait staff helped each other out quite a bit which was awesome.  I was really impressed with the food and the service.  I will definitely try this place again.  I would have given it four stars but the music blaring kind of ruins the mood.  They should really think about changing the music choices.. Maybe upbeat jazz or something."}
{"text":"The ambience and service are what make this restaurant worth going to. The food is delicious but overpriced (e.g., chicken strips for $16)."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lunch at Charleston's Scottsdale every chance we get.  We've never had a bad experience until yesterday.   My wife ordered a \"well done cheeseburger\". Pretty straightforward, right? I ordered a French Dip. What was served was a \"very rare cheeseburger\". And I mean so rare that a little first aid would have revived the beast. Our server was very apologetic and take the burger back for a redo. The replacement burger was excellent. Up to standard.   The problem is that during the time required to cook a \"well done\" burger, my french dip is getting cold. The fries are getting cold. My wife if encouraging me to start my meal, but good manners require me to NOT eat alone while watching my wife wait for her food. She's to the point where she no longer wants her meal. The manager brought the replacement burger, but not so much as an apology left his lips. He seemed embarrassed.  After the meal we were offered a complimentary dessert.  Ok, both meals should have been taken back and redone. My wife's burger should have been the complimentary part of the meal, not a lame dessert offer. We're very disappointed in the service after the fact by Charleston's. Might go back, but there are too many great places to eat in Scottsdale for it to be soon."}
{"text":"We have come back recently after not being impressed with it years ago. I'm so glad we tried again. 2 times in the last month and both times were fabulous! Great apps, salads and entrees. The service has been great too. One thing that I don't like (and why I deducted a star) is that we have felt rushed to finish our apps so they could put down our salads and then rushed to finish our salads to set down entrees. Slow it down a little please!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a date. Fine dining, fresh food, good atmosphere. I had steak shrimp and fries. Its so good. #SteakLovers"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service is great. My complaint is that I wish they had a lunch menu. I usually just order soup and salad along with a tea and that is $18.00.  Overpriced!"}
{"text":"This is usually our favorite restaurant.  We dine here at least once a week. Food is always consistent, atmosphere is nice. Our most recent visit on a Saturday afternoon was less than great. The female servers were more interested in the male servers, and the music was very loud.  There were not a lot of guests so service should have been great. The food came out too fast, no time to complete a salad, glasses not filled, we weren't asked if we wanted another glass of wine or dessert.   Servers were just not interested in serving."}
{"text":"This is probably the most consistent dining out experience I've had in a long time. The food is always delicious and served with a smile. Once I went with a party of 15 and they were closing in 20 mins, they sat and served all of us and the food was perfect, like they had just opened for the day. Now that's service!! I highly recommend this place to everyone I meet!"}
{"text":"A date night success! With a rare night away from the kiddo, we decided to try Charleston's after seeing it for a couple years. It was Saturday night, so they estimated a 20-25 minute wait but sat is much sooner. Server was attentive and friendly. We ordered the Reuben and chicken fried chicken. Everything was awesome. My husband adored his Reuben and the sweet glazed carrots, and I even loved the coleslaw, which I normally don't like. The kitchen manager came to our table to check on the food after hearing it was our first visit. When we told him we loved everything, he sent over extra sides of the carrots and coleslaw we mentioned boxed up to take home. Throughout our visit, another manager ran food to our table and ensured all was great. The service wasn't overwhelming and we were able to have a great date night. We felt at home, but better taken care of. AMAZING first experience."}
{"text":"Relaxing evening for dinner restaurant. I would have given 5 stars but their timing on bringing your check 5 min into eating just didn't taste right."}
{"text":"Good experience overall.  Wait staff very attentive, on top of all aspects despite being busy. Drink refilled before you finish it. Food also very good. Got the chicken quesadilla appetizer and top sirloin with a loaded baked potato. Steak cooked perfectly. Nice atmosphere for date night."}
{"text":"Charleston's is like our neighborhood restaurant. Its near by and cozy. My husband and I have been here many times and always enjoy the food! Consistent great service and food. We got there at about 4pm and it wasn't busy yet. We had our order taken quickly and got our drinks within minutes.  My husband ordered the Reuben and he said the corn beef was very tender. I was offered a bite and it was pretty good. I had the blackened trout.  Which was a little spicy, but very good. They always have fish that is cooked perfectly. Light and and flaky."}
{"text":"This is a good solid place for an american dinner.  Their menu is available at their website.  Our family came in after a long flight from Minnesota, pretty tired.  The concierge at our resort aimed us at Charleston's and comped us an appetizer.  We were in at sevenish on a Friday night.  Four adults and a baby had a choice of 10-15 minutes for inside or immediate patio.  We went for the patio.  We chose Shrimp Cargot for the appetizer; a half-dozen garlic-buttered shrimp in a snail tray covered with havarti cheese.  it was OK, but I think I would have preferred it with the regular ecargot bourgignon treatment.  Lots of garlic butter to sop up from the holes.    I started out with their \"PERFECT MARGARITA AZUL REPOSADO TEQUILA, COINTREAU, GRAND MARNIER.  It was served in a huge martini glass, with the shaker left with me for some dregs to boot.  Very tasty, indeed, and a heck of an attitude improver for seven bucks.  I had a bowl of potato soup, which was very passable.  I then had their CHICKEN FRIED STEAK SEASONED AND BREADED WITH A BLACK PEPPER CHIPOTLE GRAVY SERVED WITH GARLIC MASHED POTATOES AND SWEET-GLAZED CARROTS.  The chicken-fried steak was huge and tasty, and the gravy was good, although I don't recall much chipotle.  My wife had a bite and thought it was a bit tough, but I had no problem with it.  The sides were huge, too.  I finished the steak and potatoes, but couldn't eat more than half the carrots.  Considering that the one-year-old cutest grandbaby that ever was was wild for them, we brought them home.   The baby happily munched whatever we shared with her.  On the whole, it was a good cut above your average chain like Applebees or TGIFriday's.  The service was very pleasant and attentive without being obtrusive.  Before the tip, including the margarita and soft drinks around, and with the appetizer comped, the after tax was a very reasonable $77.  We got more than full value for it, and we'd be more than happy to return."}
{"text":"Snow-birds love this place! You need reservations Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings during normal dinner hours. All meals (10x) come out delicious here and the service has been fast and efficient every time. Order/pickup is a great option! I highly recommend the filet"}
{"text":"I came to Charleston's because of the big salads in their tv commercials. Boy was this a disappointment. The atmosphere is awful - really dark and heavy in the inside. The patio was closed, for no good reason. I should have known I was in for a bad meal based on the percentage of senior citizens dining...there wasn't a single person other than myself and my fiance under 50 dining there.    All the entree salads have meat in them. I asked for an entree-sized house salad, sub blue cheese for the bacon. Our server said \"well the house salad isn't served in the big entree sized bowls, it's served in side-sized bowl, but it's the same amount of food\". I, of course, gave her a surprised look and asked for clarification because that statement obviously doesn't sound correct. She repeated and said \"trust me\". Well my salad came out and it was a small handful of lettuce (for $6) and I was charged an additional $2 for a small amount of blue cheese, which she did not disclose when I ordered. Anyone over the age of 10 knows that you aren't going to get the same amount of food that comes in a giant bowl in a tiny bowl. I knew it didn't sound right but how can I argue with the server? So $8 for about 3 bites of mediocre food...should have gone a block down the street to Paradise Bakery for an $8 big salad.  Ugh, avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the Charleston in 2 years and our server/waitress, Victoria, remembered our group, after a small game of 5 questions, and was just as friendly and helpful as she was during our first visit.  Menu choices were sufficient, but I was disappointed with my menu choice, Bison Burger, which was a new menu item.  Description of Bison Burger included mustard, cheese, and pickles, and that was it. No other toppings or garnish, i.e. lettuce. I liken my Bison Burger to a McDonald's 99 cent value burger, a piece of meat slapped between two pieces of bread, nothing more.  While I will dine at the Charleston again, I will not order the Bison Burger again.  I would give a higher rating for the Charleston if it were not for my dinner"}
{"text":"Good food -- especially their ribs, good service -- prompt and attentive. A reviewer mentioned people may not consider Charleston's a kid friendly place. Well, lemme tell ya ... I was there w/ my 2 boys -- 5 and 2, and they were plenty nice to my boys. Brought them crayons, etc. They shared a kids meal and it was more than enough for the 2 of them. I would agree though that the atmosphere and decor lends itself to a more \"mature\" clientele. There were definitely a lot more \"gray haired\" customers there the times I've eaten at this establishment."}
{"text":"This was recommended by our hotel. Loved the ambiance. For our appetizer we ordered the Dynamite Shrimp and it was so delicious I had it again for my entree. My husband ordered the BBQ ribs and was very disappointed. No flavor to the meat. I tasted it and agreed. Our server was Ariel and she was very sweet. Cocktails were very good."}
{"text":"I have a severe food allergy which isn't taken too seriously by some restaurants. I was attending s company dinner at Charlton's tonight and I called ahead to speak to them about it. They transferred me to the GM, Michael. He assured me he would be handling my food himself and actually did catch something I was allergic to in what I ordered. He was able to change out the ingredients and saved me a trip to the ER.   Besides the amazing hospitality, the food was amazing. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Never visited this chain before. Found service to be quick and waiter was very accommodating. Ordered a steak which was cooked perfectly and very tender. I would visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to date night place.  The atmosphere is great and the food is excellent.  I love the salads. My new favorite appetizer is the shrimp cheese thing (can't remember the name].  Perfect lunch or small.dinner.  also love the fresh fish and roasted chicken.  Their chicken picatta is excellent."}
{"text":"Great date night place.  Dark and cozy.  We love the ambiance.  Wait staff is on top of it, very accommodating,  Best ribs and french fries.  Awesome salads."}
{"text":"Very friendly with excellent food.  A group of 5 went out for dinner it just happened to be Valentine's Day.  The manager, Mike was exceptional at getting us a table during a very busy dinner rush.   Despite being at full capacity the food was exceptional.   Very nice decor with rich woods and ambient lighting  Four of us had steak, all differs cuts and one chicken parm.  All the steaks were tender and perfectly cooked.   I did taste the chicken parm and it was out of this world.   I will be back and will get my own.    We ordered several deserts key lime pie very good and generous portion, the Apple something was awesome, as was the hot brownie with ice cream.    This is a great restaurant and so close too.   Thanks Mike, we enjoyed our dinners."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good! The service is extraordinary! Josh is outstanding& is Kara . Love the Brussels sprouts. Chicken tortilla soup is a favorite, baked potato soup also. Ribs are always good, and the rotisserie chicken is one of my favorites ."}
{"text":"Once again we brought family to Charleston's for dinner and they were very impressed with the meal.  We requested Maria and she is such a sweetie.  She is so personable and the service is impeccable.   Kudos to management for hiring such fine young people as their servers.  All the staff is clean and neat in appearance.   Thanks Maria for making our visit so enjoyable.   See you soon"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff  in a comfortable and clean restaurant with a good bar if you want a drink.  I can't imagine anything in a dinner place that this place doesn't offer in spades.  I can honestly say that Ive been eating here for years and Ive never had a average meal let alone a bad meal.  The Prime rib is great one of the best I've found and the rest of the food is just as good.  Heck even the artichoke dip my wife get's overtime is great.  And there chili on Saturdays is wonderful with great flavor is a thick meaty bowl of chili.  Honestly it's all good and the only reason I haven't tried everything on the menu is the burgers and Phili and the Prime Rib are so good it's hard to get something different unless it's raining and cold then I go for the Chicken Fried Steak, sure I can feel my arteries getting clogged but it actually is pretty much worth it."}
{"text":"Great service, great variety and very good food. If you like Houston's you will like this place including their French dip sandwich."}
{"text":"I eat at the Charleston's in Mesa all the time and let me just start by saying it's much better. In Mesa the host hold the door open, greets you with a smile and actually engages with you. Here the girl at the door was looking down didn't even notice me. I went in and sat at the bar, dirty tables all around me. The bartender didn't say hi. Walked past me to put some juice away in a cooler. He came over and asked what will it be. I said how about a menu and a water. I ordered. He never took the menu away. The food was just as good as Mesa but the service is horrible. The bartender later pulled an energy drink out of the ice bin in which he got my water from. My food came I had no silverware. My water was empty three times two where I had to ask for a refill. The servers spent their time in a huddle in the corner of the bar. The bartender dropped the check about a minute after I got y food. Although he saw I was messing with my wallet and had half a sandwich left, he didn't offer a box. Finally another server asked me if I needed one. The bartender drop the lid to the mint container on the ground and put it right back on. As I left not one person acknowledged my presence. The manager (I assume, a man in a grey dress shirt) a server and the same host were at the door laughing about something on the managers phone, none of them said a word to me. I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"the only reason I ate here is because the Texas roadhouse next to it is always super busy and there was a 40 minute wait time. no wait at all at charleston's, and with good reason. the food is very overpriced especially when you consider portion size. there is no bread served while you wait for your food to arrive either which is disappointing as well. I ordered the top sirloin, about $25, a few bites in I pulled a very long hair out of my mouth. the manager asked how everything was and I told him everything was good except the hair in my food. he offered free dessert but for the price of the steak and the overall menu I'm sure any decent restaurant would have comped the meal. TEXAS ROADHOUSE BEATS THE PANTS OFF OF THIS PLACE HANDS DOWN. portion, quality and value."}
{"text":"They have a sausage with fresh basil thin pizza on the app menu that is amazing.  I don't know what they do to it, but it's so damn good.  I've tried the champagne chicken salad which is good too, and Mr. M and I have shared the chicken and ribs entree which is a lot of food, so perfect to share, and we've enjoyed that too.  But we have a regular routine of swinging in here just for that pizza and a beer or a glass of wine.  We've always had great service in the bar area.  I like the dark wood and the booths are semi-private which is nice if you want to carry on a conversation.  The pizza is 5-stars and the wine gets 3-stars because they give a skimpy pour for the price."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday Night. They were very busy! they even had a waiting list. But, when we walked in we were lucky enough to be seated right away.  No other party of 2 were on that waiting list, so that is why. Service here is spectacular!   Food was great! We got the shrimp cargot as an appetizer.  was very good, but the very best part of the meal.??? The Ribs. As always they were amazing. They fell right off the bone, they were tender and delicious! Great service, great food, and lots of parking. You cannot ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"I have to say this is not my favorite location. I find the one in Chandler much better. Staff is far more attentive in Chandler location,as well as more knowledgable about the food they carry. The food even seems better there. We had always wanted to try this location, for something new. We really like the one in Chandler so we thought this one would be just as good if not better. Sad disappointment.  Not enough BBQ sause,food was not really hot, just warm. Plus, we had to keep asking for refills on our drinks.  I cannot see any reason to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding lunch today at Charleston's.  Hubby had pork chops and I had fish.  Service was outstanding and the food were perfect.  We couldn't finish it all so asked for boxes to take home the left overs and they were delivered quickly to our table.  I am sure our waiter was Aaron and he was really great helping us pick out our selection. This was our first visit will not be our last. The place was very busy and we know why!"}
{"text":"This place is always good.  Food is consistent, place is spotless and the  wait staff are nice beyond measure.  We got chips and salsa to start, and they refilled our chips for free.  We both got the chicken club salad, but instead of fried chicken we got grilled.  The chicken was pretty overdone, but not so much so that I felt the need to send it back.  I don't know how they do it, but this place always makes you feel welcome, and I have never had bad service here.  Prices are a little expensive for my blood, but if Megan and I feel the need to treat ourselves, we will go back.  The rolls are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, the place was busy but we still managed to get a table.  Food tasted amazing! Everything came quick and we were surprised by how little they charged.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best ribs. Must have with glazed carrots and mashed potatoes. Sooo good. Also the house salad with raspberry viniagrette and that honey glazed croissant. Perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Give Charleston's a shot. Prime Rib French Dip is one of my favorites. Their version is TASTY, Prime Rib is THEE BEST. Creamy horseradish on the side. Great fries. EXCELLENT service at either a booth or at the bar.  Their Reuben is OFF THE CHARTS. Same as above. TERRIFIC service, GREAT fries or Cole Slaw. Drinks are re-filled, most of the time BEFORE they're empty.   These people know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I ordered oven roasted herb chicken. It comes as a half a chicken. Not as big as you'd think, especially for the price. Flavor was overpowered by  pepper and rosemary, the garlic mash had lumps of red potatoes surrounded by way too much sour cream.  The baked beans were more like a thick BBQ sauce that had a few beans in it. My Husband had the chicken tenders. They were dry and again over powered by the cornflakes they roll them in.  The cole slaw was decent.  It's very dark, too dark for my taste. They must keep it that way so you can't see the beat up old furniture.  If your a smoker you might not notice the overly pungent flavors."}
{"text":"This location rocks! We've been in AZ and TX and let me tell you, they have the BEST ribs on the planet! You would never guess it, but since being in the land of the bbq nation = TX, this place wins hands down.  They also have the best spinach and arti dip around. Salads are great, glazed carrots are to die for, and honey-drenched croissants that will make you drool. Ok, now I'm hungry...Service is always top notch and friendly. Would recommend to anyone for any type of food - they have it all!"}
{"text":"charlestons is one of the few chains i actually enjoy. I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too.   They have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it!  yay for charlestons!"}
{"text":"Always great food, atmosphere,  and service. A tad on the pricey side but worth it for what you get. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"I always want to get the Reuben here, but last night I wanted to eat healthy so I ordered the kale salad with the pastrami and sour krout on top. The waitress had never had an order like that but it came out perfectly. We were too full to get the bread pudding so we got it to go. She made sure we knew exactly how to heat it up later to get the same delicious experience.  Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here while I waited for my car to get serviced. The place looked really nice and comfortable inside. The hostess and server were very nice and pleasant. The only thing I recommend is to NOT order the steak fried chicken. It was extremely chewy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their service. One meal was delivered wrong, second drinks were not offered. When we got the second order of drinks they still had the order wrong. It was a special occasion, 2 birthdays, one was a 75th. They asked on their reservation site if it was a special occasion, but did nothing to celebrate it in house. Make sure you request a table when you make your reservation unless you want to be stuffed into a small booth."}
{"text":"I love charelstons! 5 star service and food at 3 star price. Its all about the ribs and chicken, its amazing. Also the lobster soup is a banger as well."}
{"text":"Great food and a great kids selection on the menu, been here multiple times and always had a great experience with food and service."}
{"text":"Update: I went back yesterday 12/6/16. D\ Not sure what is happening here, but it is not good. Going down hill. Used to love this place. Very bummed   I have been coming here for a couple of years. The food is generally consistent and good. Service was usually very good and friendly as well. But that seems to have changed over the recent months. There is a manager that never smiles and seems to have a negative impact on the staff. When he is there he never has stopped to ask how our meal is, like other managers (I am there at least once a week).  Food gets five stars. Declining atmosphere took 2 stars away"}
{"text":"Great food a little pricey but it's always a great atmosphere. I don't go often due to the price but it's good food whenever we go usually good service as well. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"3 of us had dinner here and we all enjoyed the service and the food, they have one of the best children's menu offerings around, making this a great go to place for families with children. I had a perfect steak, my husband had the pork chops and our sides were great."}
{"text":"A favorite place of my family, have been here a couple times when I visit them in Gilbert.  File under: mega-sized portions, well done and tasty, but nothing highly inventive.  Perfectly formulated to get you to eat and drink as much as possible.    Booths extra large for the extra large customers.    Having poked fun as I always do at such suburban oases, I have to say I found the service to be extremely generous, I was only halfway done with my diet coke before they brought another, to the tune of I think 6 refills before I knew it, it was almost as if there were someone standing at my side pouring a pitcher down my throat.  The pork chops were double wide and perfectly cooked, the salad was fresh and crispy, and the appetizers were huge and well fried."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch.  The food was tasty and so was the service, but they only had the regular dinner menu and not a lunch menu.   The manager walked around and made sure that we had everything we needed and I noticed they continued to fill up your glass.  They never let it go below half full."}
{"text":"I was in town to visit family for Easter and my parents made reservations here for Easter brunch/dinner. This is one of their favorite restaurants in the area, and I was glad to have them directing me on the menu.  Service:  Great service from all of the staff. Very attentive, but didn't ever feel like they were hovering over us. They did a great job at clearing unnecessary plates/items from our table and refilling drinks without asking.   Food Recommendations: I got the catfish (2 huge portions) that comes with 2 sides. I opted for their fried okra and mashed potatoes. The okra was good, but the Catfish and Mashed Potatoes stole the show. I'd highly recommend trying these. Keep in mind that the portions are HUGE, so you could easily share one entree with 2 people with regular appetites, or plan to take home leftovers if you're ordering this for one person. Their sweet tea was also a hit with my family.  My step-dad ordered the pork chops and that is another must-try! Again, the portions are huge, so he wasn't able to finish everything, but was more than happy to take this home.   The table ordered bread pudding for dessert and it was shared between 4 people who were already stuffed.   I'd definitely go here again, but make sure to save room because it's a ton of food."}
{"text":"This is our go to date night restaurant. Everything on the menu is delicious. The service is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here last night for our anniversary.   The prime rib was excellent,  & the fillet mignon was superb!  Our server, Kendall,  was awesome. ...she made our night extra special!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Hickory barbecue sauce was pleasantly and surprisingly delicious. We dined during happy hour but were not made aware of it until the end of our meal after reading the receipt. Had the waitress informed us of the deals our dining experience would've been better."}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour for our food and our server Mariah had to be asked multiple times for little things and still no follow through. I gave 4 stars because the food was delicious and the manager paid for my parties dinner...great service from him"}
{"text":"I have always seen the great reviews about Charleston's and always wanted to try it but it just reminded me of a Bennigans which I cannot stand but I finally decided to give this place a shot.. I sat at the bar for lunch which was empty but I didn't mind since I got served right away. I went with what the waitress suggested which was the ribs and I am glad I did. These ribs were cooked perfectly and the meat just fell right off the bones. There baked beans were also amazing especially since I am not a fan of them I actually enjoyed Charleston's baked beans and there fries were crispy and good. I tried there Perfect margarita but it wasn't perfect since it mostly consisted of margarita mix which I can see considering this place isn't a Mexican restaurant. But overall I was impressed with Charleston's and will probably be back."}
{"text":"Good menu and bar.  Have eaten here a few times.  Food is very good and well presented. We like this place because we can a great meal in an upscale environment. Prices are reasonable and the service was good. It is a place you can relax and feel comfortable."}
{"text":"This was my first time here or ever hearing of this chain but I am so glad we gave it a try it's so delicious I will Definitely be going back! The food was great the service was awesome and atmosphere was really chill good for family's groups or a date night!!"}
{"text":"Julie, the bartender, is always extremely friendly and attentive.  Food is always great and consistent. Great for lunch and happy hour."}
{"text":"We were a little leery after reading a couple of the reviews but decided to give its whirl. The price is a little steeper than some places but after trying the food....quality and flavor of the food made it 100% worth it.   I LOVE chicken piccata but rarely find it on the menu, when I do, I'm often disappointed. In the past, Cheesecake Factory was my favorite. They have now been usurped! Charleston's piccata is soooo good! I try to stay away from carbs and was able to substitute the noodles. I chose the burgundy mushroom since the dish already had mixed veggies on the plate. The mushrooms were so delish!  My husband had the French dip sandwich with mashed potatoes. He said it was the best French Dip he's ever had.   Service was great. We were pleased that when we asked if any meat was used in the gravy, he said no meat but offered to check what they used as a base. Turns out it was bacon fat. He brought a sample back with him too. My husband is not a pork fan so he skipped the gravy but still thought the  potatoes had excellent flavor.   Final note: the parking lot was packed but we were seated quickly and service was prompt. Servings were large and we both brought home plenty of leftovers.   We will absolutely come back, it's totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing soups, sandwiches, salads ,etc. They have great kids meals for inexpensive and large portions. We had an issue with a take out order and called to speak with the GM. He was amazing! Could not have been nicer and we have already been back. Very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been to Charleston before but not at this location.  Charleston is the kind of place where you can relax, talk without shouting, and have a delicious meal. The atomshpere is just right for a relaxing meal, and after a really long day I needed this.  I started my dinner with the potato soup.  Perfect!!!!!!! OMG try the croissants which I think you have to order, (I am not so sure if they come with any of the entrees)  melt in your mouth.  I had a steak which was cooked to order and it was so tender I didn't have to use my knife.  The wait staff is very organized and are at your table before you have to ask for something. You can tell they have been trained well. Would I come back.  Already have."}
{"text":"From a former employee smh... I just couldn't make it. The kitchen works so well. I was confounded with the expertise and well managed work effort. I have never seen a more organized kitchen and it made me want to do better. Ingredients are of great quality and they take no shortcuts, making sure they only serve the best food before leaving the kitchen."}
{"text":"Prime rib was amazing and so was the chicken fried steak!!!  Great place for a hearty meal and not expensive!"}
{"text":"First off, I just wanted to point out that I've never written a bad review for any restaurant; if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all... and all that rot.  Well, I've let both my dinner and feelings towards my experience tonight stew, and both are just getting worse with time.   I went into the Scottsdale & Bell location with my niece and nephew as they love the food from this chain. We'd never been to this location and, not sorry to say, we won't ever be going back.   Upon entering, the short, brunette hostess (I wish now I'd asked for her name because I'm likely to call this location in the morning to complain) bluntly asked how many in my party with not even a smile. I replied that we were three. Her reply then was short and incredibly rude, \"The wait is half an hour.\" Again, no smile. I'm not sure if she meant to deter me from putting our name down but I did so anyway. We exited the restaurant with our pager and sat outside patiently. As we passed the time (OVER half an hour), I took note of those going in. After the kids asked how much time we'd waited already, I decided to just go inside and see if there was room to wait so we could see progress. Imagine my surprise when NO ONE was waiting and ALL parties of different sizes that arrived after us were already seated. I decided not to make a scene but to just sit right in front of the hostess that took down our name and look pointedly at her. Well, I suppose she noticed because a minute later our pager finally went off. A different, nicer seating hostess took us to our table... without an apology from the original girl. I won't speculate as to why we were treated with such distaste, but I will state that we don't look like the majority of people that frequent this location.   Finally seated, our waiter came up fairly quickly to take our drink order... and that's where the good service stopped. Between getting our drinks, one of which was an iced tea that tasted grossly old (I might be picky at this point, however), and getting the check, the waiter quickly checked on us only once and only offered to get a bag for our leftovers after the other waitress we asked had forgotten. Perhaps my disgust with my experience showed on my face and he was too scared to approach me. The manager did his routine stop by and I bit my tongue, else I would have let him know right there in front of everyone what I thought of his establishment.   And finally, to critique the food. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was incredibly salty. Almost inedible salty. I mentioned the bad iced tea earlier that I didn't return but I had to send back my niece's pork chop as we ordered well done and it was still pink in places. The cooks must not know about the dangers of undercooked pork. Yeah, people can die.   When I finally got the bill after waiting for 10 minutes once our table was kind of cleared, I saw that no discount was applied and I received no second visit from the manager to offer an apology. I was going to ask for the manager but I was just ready to leave at this point. I paid the grossly expensive bill and left a meager tip.   Thanks again to the seating hostess for being the sole good experience from tonight. I really hope you had a pleasant evening too and that your little coworker learns the value of professionalism in the workplace.   Peace out, Charleston's. I'd rather eat Ramen soup every day for the rest of my life than ever return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Great steaks, salmon, and salads!  There is a great patio to sit when the weather is nice as well."}
{"text":"Great menu!!! Lots of food. The prime rib, ribs, catfish, side salads, shrimp cargo- ALL DELISH! What I also like about Charlestons are the children's menu, very reasonable and they give a lot of food for the price. We love this place!! Waiters are also really nice and work hard for their tips!"}
{"text":"Checked out Charleston's for Mother's Day lunch. Called the night before to see if they were still taking reservations, to my surprise they were. Was seated shortly after arriving. Restaurant was busy but not crazy busy. Wait staff very attentive. Started with the Cream Spinach Artichoke Dip-yummy & a great start. My mom ordered the 10 oz. Prime Rib & loved every bite of it. I ordered the Famous French Dip-deeelicious!! Wait staff very attentive, the only thing that was odd was the waiter leaving the check before we were even done with our meal."}
{"text":"Just stopped for a drink, but the bartender made a very tasty Old Fashioned. Well done."}
{"text":"Took my Mom here while she was visiting this summer, I'd only been for apps before because the Mr loves a dish they call \"shrimpcargot\" (it's unique and tasty for non snail types ;) We were seated early for our reservation, and both the hostess and waitress wished Mom a Happy Birthday. Nice start!   Mom enjoyed her glass of Pinot Grigio, my dirty Belvedere martini came with blue cheese stuffed olives and was on point. The loaded baked potato soup was good, but they put the bacon I requested left off in. My blackened Barramundi was perfectly executed; Mom loved the shrimp scampi, and Scott had a steak that was cooked to his liking; it was an enjoyable dining experience; we were not rushed, water was refilled regularly, and plates cleared in a timely manner.   Service was very friendly from start to finish, and they did offer to sing Happy Birthday. We declined, but shared a very tasty Key Lime pie for dessert to-go, without fanfare. For food alone this would be a 3.5* review; they aren't doing anything revolutionary, but it was a good meal. The service was 4* and I rounded up because of it. We have already and will continue to return for \"shrimpcargot\" and the catch of the day."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu .. Kake salad is off the hook. Add a protein ( shrimp , salmon ) and step it up! Very consistent and service is good."}
{"text":"If you don't care about watching what you eat, you've found the right place. The dishes that I tried were all very good (taste-wise), but you feel like you're carrying twins after you get up from the table. As far as portions go, this place is very generous. Their daily soup offerings are surprisingly very good and some of the best I've had in the Valley so far. The rest of their food is pretty heavy, but alright when it comes to flavor. It kinda borders on bland and not-too-bad. The food's heaviness really over shadows any taste that it might have. In truth, this spot is really \"old money\" dining on a Friday night, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you come here though, be sure to make this your big meal for the day because you're going to feel like you're wearing an inner tube around your waist by the time you're done."}
{"text":"The chicken ciabatta sandwich is out of this world. Great service and many delicious menu items makes Charlestons one of my regular lunch destinations"}
{"text":"This was a really good experience for me. Met a friend here for lunch and it was fantastic!  The baked potato soup was delicious and the waitress was just great!"}
{"text":"Celebrated Mother's Day at Charleston's this evening with my family. As usual, the food was solid. Shrimp-cargot, prime rib, and key lime pie? Yes please.   As with most dining experiences, the service can make or break the deal. We were fortunate enough to have Mikaela as our server; she was great! Despite the holiday crowds, Mikaela was attentive and gracious, and made all of us feel comfortable and welcomed. It was a great time for all of us, and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I know you die hard yelpers think chain restaurants are EVIL, but I have never had a bad meal here. The glazed carrots are as \"sweet as yams\" but makes you think your eating healthy... Cause there carrots."}
{"text":"What do you get when you have a mix of all favorite ingredients, like lots of butter, garlic, cheese and seafood? Deliciousness! But Charleston's name for it should do: Shrimp Scargot. Also, next time you stop by for happy hour, which gives you a dollar off drinks, ask for the Frozen Bellini. Good stuff! Jamie from the bar was really nice. I went with a friend and she enjoyed it too, so just for that alone this visit scores high."}
{"text":"Solid choice for dinner or drinks. Our server was super friendly and funny. Wine list is very reasonably priced. My Waldorf salad was giant and came with a croissant. The husbands hickory burger was cooked perfectly medium rare. I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a varied menu with lots of choice."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here about a dozen times with coworkers and the food and service has always been excellent!! I've had salads, burgers, sandwiches, and even the chicken fried steak (which was a TON of food...I have a huge appetite and I overstuffed myself until I was in pain) and they've all been delicious. Haven't had a bad meal or negative experience once. On another note, I recently needed an itemized receipt to expense a lunch from weeks ago, and after 1.5 minutes on the phone with the GM, he sent me what I needed within the hour. Great service during AND after my dining experience. I'll definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"We're not natives, but come out for spring training each year and stumbled into Charleston's on one of our trips about four years ago. The price, ambiance, and service make this a must-see every time we go. A fantastic menu with food that really outstrips the price, Charleston's reminds me of what the mostly-defunct Houston's chain should have been, if they hadn't had such steep prices.  Reservations accepted, and they might be needed on busy nights."}
{"text":"First time here and l'lol be returning! The staff was professional and welcoming. I got the ribs which come with beans and fries! I also sampled off my family's plates. The steak was amazing as well as the salads. My favorite is the spinach dip. Great decorum and nice interior look!"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here several times before.  This time we came with the extended family, 14 in all.  Seating such a large group is always a challenge, but we very pleased with the table seating that was made for us (had a reservation).  The ribs and fried catfish are 2 of our favorite dishes.  The portions are generous and are always very well prepared.  If you can manage, the desert portions are equally generous.  The meals are a great value for the money.  I would be remiss if I did not add that the staff are wonderful, friendly and great service."}
{"text":"I had an interesting experience here last Friday. I have celiac disease, and when I told the waitress that, she took it seriously. (I wish more places would, because we get sick when they don't.) After I ordered my dinner, three other employees came over to the table just to discuss the food that was safe to eat and make sure I'd ordered the right thing.   Something happened between my order and it being brought out, because the order was wrong and definitely not safe for me to eat. I noticed it and reported it right away. They brought out the right food quickly and apologized and insisted the dinner was on them. I was impressed with the attention and effort. Mistakes happen, and they were really gracious about it. I will return. :)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good service, mediocre offerings on the menu. I liked the place but wish they would have had some other light meal offerings, such as sandwiches.   I asked for jalapenos on my burger and they did not carry them, imagine that, Arizona and no jalapenos. Luckily one of the kitchen staffers had his own stash and helped me out! Kudos to that guy!  Again, nice atmosphere but the food offerings were pricey and definitely no diverse."}
{"text":"Our 5th time n the service n food is still great  The crispy chicken sandwich is really good. Tried burgundy mushrooms as well. If u like French onion soup u will love these shrooms. The ribs were fantastic again"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic dining experience here. From the time we entered the store we felt valued as patrons. This particular location is very clean and has a tremendous atmosphere. Our server, Carol, was awesome. Great personality, knowledgeable on the menu, attentive, and efficient. The food we ordered, Scampi and Prime Rib, was outstanding. We highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"First time visit last night and it was fantastic! Great service, food was REALLY good...just a wonderful experience. Although it was a Saturday night and busy, we were seated after just a few minutes. Decor is really well done with nice atmosphere...we even commented how easy we could have a conversation without having to yell (lol) even though the place was packed. From the drinks, to the salad, all the way to dessert was just delicious! My GF had the chicken piccata and I had the shrimp scampi...both dishes were just spot on amazing. Generous piece of key lime pie for dessert which was very good as well. Shame on me for forgetting our waitress' name but she was excellent too. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the hamburgers and the baby back ribs/chicken combo but the food, for the most part, was amazing. The chicken was a bit dry in the combo but the ribs were delicious. The ambiance of the place is nice too.  Surprisingly, the price for hamburgers were cheap, about 10-15 bucks each I believe, with sides. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner. Whether you want just a nice burger or something else."}
{"text":"Taste just like roadhouse but more expensive. The service is much better than roadhouse and it's more classier. The catfish plate is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I come here every year (from California) and have been coming every year for the past 13 years or so. We always come with a party of 25-30 people...I know...it's crazy lol but the servers are always awesome. We spend a good 3 hours from start to finish, because...well... It's a lot of people to take care of.  The food is fantastic, the service is good. My only complaint tonight is that the chefs need to understand what medium means when referring to how done you want your prime rib.  They brought me my plate and my meat was still kicking and mooing.  Then I sent it back to be cooked a bit longer (which I NEVER do) and it still came back kicking. I ate it. I damn near chocked because I couldn't cut it into small enough pieces. But, tonight I had beef sashimi and it was kind of disturbing.   But this is just 1 of probably 15 times. I still love it here"}
{"text":"They used to be good. Not so anymore. $30 prime rib that you could hardly cut with a knife. Doesn't make sense they would risk loosing long time customers by serving less than exceptional food. Too bad. I'll be looking for another Resturant."}
{"text":"OK place. Like others of the same ilk: Cheddar's, O'Charleys, Chili's, TGIFriday's, etc., but a more varied menu than Chili's or TGIFriday's. Gripe: Draft beers were $5 each with meal and salads were $14, very pricey we think. However, daughter and I split a Walt's Champaigne Chicken Salad since they are huge. The men had chicken fried steak and had leftovers for a box. Grandson liked the kid's ribs. Food was good. Baked potato soup was excellent, as was their gumbo. Server was good, food brought in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The service at Charleston's has truly gone downhill. The past few times we have come here, we have been treated extremely poorly (most likely due to our age), and treated like peasants. Mind you, my boyfriend and I are both of drinking age and absolutely can afford alcohol if we wanted, but we simply don't. But the servers treat us like literal trash because either they think we won't have a fatty-check or because since we're younger we'd be poor tippers. Who knows what they think, but both are false.   On one occasion, when we were left with our check presenter to pay, our server came up to us (after a very lackluster and almost absent meal service, mind you) picked it up, and turned back around and asked us \"Is there even anything in here?!\" without opening it up and looking for himself. Would he have done that to the 50-something-year-old couple sitting across from us? Absolutely not.   On our most recent visit, our server was so rude and seemed blatantly disgusted by having to serve us, yet when he checked on his other tables, had a complete change in demeanor. He really didn't seem to care whatsoever. He dropped our food off at the table by practically shoving the plates infront of us and just walking away without asking if we needed anything else.   In my personal opinion, this is a customer service industry. The customer, no matter how old, or how old they look for that matter, should NEVER be treated poorly like this. I've had better and more attentive service at a Buffalo Wild Wings on a football gameday, and that is saying something.   The only reason I come here anymore is because of my boyfriend's love affair with their honey mustard and freshly-baked croissants. But if you ask me, two times in a row with shoddy service like this is a big 86 from our list of frequented restaurants.   Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Charlestons since they opened up. We finally decided to take family and have a good dinner. My wife and I had steak and the first time we really had fatty, grisly while every one else had a great meal. Didn't want to complain when every one else was real happy. I don't think I will go back and treat friend and family and live through this again"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for date night with the wife and 2 year old.  The bar, the low lights, the open kitchen area, and all booth seating, makes for a nice ambiance!  The food is good, fresh, and hot with there own culinary touches.   Keep a look out for the special menu off the day that is made from scratch! The waiter and staff worked seamlessly together to make our experience great.   Some of the best service we have experienced at any restaurant!  Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Dinning with a group that consisted of 6 for a birthday dinner.  Made a reservation a few hours prior and when we arrived the staff struggled to put 3 small tables together leaving our party to wait 15 minutes.... Dinner was okay no complaints about the food.... My biggest complaint is when finishing our meals our waiter had asked if my daughter and were finished w our meals and offered boxes. I took him up on the boxes expecting him to take our plates to the kitchen to have them packed....he promptly returned with boxes for us to pack ourselves..... I know it's not that huge of an issue but being an steak restaurant I would expect more service.... I know of sandwich shops and delis that offer meal packaging to go..."}
{"text":"This is it. Best steaks, best salads (blue cheese), and great fast service.  I always get the filet mignon medium. Hot pink center, not bloody.  Always served piping served hot.   Limited menu means everything in it is their specialty.  No cheap well drinks at happy hour. Regular drinks are $1 off, but use great spirits.  My favorite steak"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch in Mesa, AZ at Charleston's. It was about 3:15 pm when we walked in. There was only two other occupied  tables in the dinning room. The decor is much like Hillstone / Houstons / Bandera. The menu and food is much like them too. Our table ordered the Baby Back Ribs and the Prime Rib. The food was excellent. The 10 oz Prime Rib ordered medium rare was so good and for only $23. The two orders of Baby Back Ribs were gone in no time.   Plenty of parking in the shopping center. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Another great time at Charleston's. Ordered the ribs and they are about the best I have had. Even the carrots are good here. Bread pudding A+. Excellent combination of good food, service, and atmosphere make an evening at Charleston's a smart choice."}

{"text":"Charlestons has got to be by far one of my favorite restaurants. First of all, its not very expesive but gives the illusion of a high class nicer restaurant. The service is impeccable and the staff really does care about the customer. They will comp a meal if they can tell someone is not happy with it. They also work as a team so your drink glasses never go empty. I also love the fact that I have never had to experience screaming kids. For some reason, I think people don't consider this a kid friendly restaurant which is fine with me!  But my favorite thing about Charlestons is definately the food!!! I am absolutely in love with the Walt's Champaign chicken salad and their croissants with honey drizzle are incredible! I have tried several other dishes here so here are my other recommendations:    Chicken salad sandwich - huge and just a downright good sammich, Chicken club salad - This is the hubs fav salad. Totally a man's salad with fried chicken, bacon, avocado, cheese, and make sure to order with lots of ranch dressing to clog your arteries even further Rigatony Bolognese - For not being an italian restaurant, this dish was still amazing. Creamy and a little spicy. Huge portion also Over Roasted Chicken - One of the best chicken dishes Ive ever had! Order with the mashed potatoes (very good consistency and flavor) and the baked beans (dip the chicken in the beans... crazy but sooooo good) Prime Rib with mashed potatoes - Ive have never had their prime rib but the hub says its one of the best he has had and is consistently well trimmed and has had good flavor each time he's ordered it.   A few other things worthy of mention:  Maryland crab cakes (full of crab and the apple relish served with it is fresh and a really good accompanyment), and the creamy chicken noodle soup (only served one day a week but this is the best chicken noodle soup Ive ever had and I really dont like chicken noodle soup! I would eat this shit even when I am not sick!)  And the last, most important thing to remember if you go to Charlestons: YOU MUST ORDER THE BREAD PUDDING!!! Yes yes, I saved the best for last. This bread pudding is the best bread pudding you will ever have. I have converted many a bread pudding hater (myself included) with this bread pudding. Haha. Take my advise and you will be glad you did. I expect a thank you!!!!  So to sum it up, Charlestons may be a chain restaurant but I believe its one of the best chains out there. Every time I eat there, I am content with the overall experience. Try this restaurant and their bread pudding and you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Had to update my previous 5 star review to 3... On New Years Eve went to Charleston for one of my favorite burgers... Really Disappointed... Had reservations & was seated right on time our waitress was very nice and I ordered classic burger medium well, it was served in 20 minutes which was fine because at 6:30 the restaurant was very busy,  my burger was medium rare, very greasy, I was going to question our waitress but she was so busy that after 15 minutes I just decided to go ahead & eat anyway, don't know if it was because of the day or maybe they changed management or chef but I won't be going back anytime soon, the side of coleslaw was good & my wine was chilled also my wife's chicken salad was fine, but my burger was below satisfying, even not as good as a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Can't ask for more from a weekday dinner!  Affordable and classy aren't usually used in the same sentence, but this place just about pulls it off.  From the fire place upon entering, to the darker wood decor in the dining room, and the $18 sirloin with a huge baked potato, you really can't go wrong.  My wife and I had 3 drinks a couple of salads, and our own entrees and got out of there for under $75 tip included.  Best of all, we left feeling like we didn't eat at a frozen food chain like Applebee's."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner prime rib was cooked to perfection tender as could be. The croissants melted in your mouth. Wife thoroughly enjoyed her kale salad, cocktails are excellent. Our waitress Alex was outstanding and friendly. What an evening,  beautiful restaurant great food wonderful atmosphere will definitely become a loyal customer. Thank you"}
{"text":"We went there around 2:00ish on Saturday, the food took about an hour to get to our table and the restaurant was not busy. The service was great at filling our drinks but that was the only thing that was timely."}
{"text":"Welcome to an excellent case study in why a nice property in a desirable, high-traffic location would be more than half empty during dinner.  Exhibit A: Three empty-headed hostesses so busy bantering wittily with themselves that it took them over two minutes to acknowledge my existence.  Exhibit B: I ordered a glass of Pinot and it tasted like it had been opened sometime during prior year.  I mentioned to bartender who said \"no, I just opened it\" rather than offering a replacement.  And what a Happy Hour: $1 off -- can they spare it?  Dinner portions were excellent, but food was mediocre, other than the super croissants: warm and delicious, but nowhere near enough to make up for the rest of the experience.  With so many other superb options in Scottsdale, I can't see this place lasting another year.  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great dinner again here! Nadine was our server and was polite, happy, and attentive. Even in a huge rush with prom going on we were able to sit comfortable in the bar and sat down within 15 min."}
{"text":"Not the greatest.  Decent average food more comparable to a chain restaurant quality.  Prices are higher then food is really worth."}
{"text":"Great staff and good food. Have gone here several times with a large group on short notice and have never had a problem."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a restaurant we dine at back home in Reading, PA called Austin's. The ribs were excellent. There is something good for everyone here."}
{"text":"Super service. Croissants   were fantastic, BBQ ribs fell off the bone!  We were very pleased."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from out of town and wanted to find a reasonably priced restaurant. I had the chicken and ribs which were very good. My husband ordered a medium rare steak that came very rare.  The waiter was friendly and helpful enough. The best part by far was the desert-apple cobbler. Delicious and easily sharable."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and a friend on a break from the Scottsdale horse show last weekend.  The atmosphere is more upscale than I'd expected, but prices didn't seem too exorbitant.  I had the smoked chicken spinach salad, and it was delicious.  The dressing was tasty, the roasted peppers were a good addition, and the chicken was well-cooked.  I was expecting it to be a little more like a pasta salad based on the description, but I ended up really liking it.  Plus, the croissant it came with was absolutely amazing.  My parents split the chicken ciabatta sandwich and said it was great.  They also both got a cup of the clam chowder and liked it, but said it wasn't fantastic.  My friend got a reuben and enjoyed it, but loved the potato soup.  They had a decent beer selection and were great with water and other drink refills.  I'd definitely go back.  And order something that came with/on a croissant."}
{"text":"I was taken here for lunch with a couple of guys by one of my partners at work. I can't remember what I had but I remember the portion being perfect. I left and didn't feel like a zombie after lunch. Our waitress was on top of her game. My glass never went below the halfway mark before getting a refill. I would absolutely go back again and I plan to as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Ice tea appears from nowhere! I ordered tea and our waitress was so on top of it, I didn't even realize that I NEVER RAN OUT OF TEA. Downside: I had to go to the restroom a million times. My salad was delicious, and quite large, but $17 was quite expensive for a lunch meal."}
{"text":"Have been here a dozen or more times since moving to the area, and have had a great experience each time. The prime rib French dip melts in your mouth. The salads are fresh and flavorful. The drinks are yummy, and the waitstaff is always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Seriously probably one of the best restaurants in the Chandler region. Their prime rib French dip is amazing. Their service is amazing. And the atmosphere is very upscale considering their prices are very reasonable. This is one of my favorite restaurants to take out of town guests to. Everything that anyone I know has ever ordered here has been exceptional."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a very good restaurant. Four of us went to dinner this evening, I had their grilled salmon and asparagus. The portion was big and it had a delicious smoky flavor, they gave me so much asparagus I couldn't eat it all. Two of my companions at stake which they both said were excellent. The third had a rotisserie chicken, and he's a picky eater and he liked it a lot. This is the fifth time I've been to this restaurant and it has been excellent every time. Our waiter Mike did a fantastic job of staying on top of everything. the atmosphere is very good and the overall feeling and service is excellent.I can hardly wait to go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is average American food with a big price. Was craving a French dip. I must have not looked right at the price, but 19.00? Really,  and with French fries. The bread was soggy when it arrived and the meat inside was cold. The fries were amazing. Crunchy and yummy.  Husband got a burger. Nothing special. Just a frozen patty cooked like a home one.  Got a diet coke and ice tea. All of this was 40.00. Cant say I would come back anytime soon. It was average, could have got same thing at Dennys, or something like that for way less."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food is fresh and very tasty. Bread pudding is amazing. Only complaint is that they do not have certain desserts or menu items all the time. Love the pineapple upside down cake and the Hawaiian steak, but those items aren't always available."}
{"text":"I went there on news years eve. They were incredibly busy and I still got the best service. The staff was so polite and nice. And of course the food was amazing as always. Our waitress markie was so funny and attentive. I had the best experience!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service.  The hostess held the door open for me as I walked in.  I proceeded to the dark granite and dark wood ladened bar, which was fairly slow due to the time and day.  Immediately the amazingly attentive and attractive bartender (who was on her first day of training) was asking me how I was doing, giving me a menu, and figuring whether or not I wanted something instantly, or if I needed a little time.  If I lived closer, this would be my daytime hideaway on my days off. I've worked in the restaurant business for nearly 20 years, and I was impressed  Attn manager: great promotion decision!  Her trainer was equally impressive as well."}
{"text":"So after a bumpy start to the evening, my girlfriend's birthday party ended up here. First off, the staff was AMAZING! Greeted us warmly and even let us move when we had more people come than expected. Andrew E was our waiter and he was on point allllll night!! We had split checks and he handled that! He kept up on drinks, the food came quickly and MOST OF ALL, he spoiled the birthday girl!!! This was my first visit to Charleston's and not the last! I WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"This is the only chain I support whole heartedly!  Visited this Scottsdale location last night and received great service and a fresh flavorful salad. I've never been disappointed with Charleston's. The decor is the nice dark cherry wood and the bar has a good happy hour with just enough TVs to catch a game but resist the \"sports bar\" title.  Love: baked potato, croissants, ribs, salad and if your indulging-don't miss the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night and the ribs were incredible - the concept reminded me of Houston's, but much better pricing and good atmosphere.    The service from the time you walked in the door to at the table was exceptional.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened but this place has gone downhill. The service that was once so amazing, sucked. Our waitress had us wait over 10 minutes from getting our drinks to when she came back for our food order. I ordered a side salad with my meal and that, which in the past would come out within less than 5 minutes, took close to 15 minutes. When I asked the waitress if it was coming soon, she said yes it should be right up. Thing is, the servers make the salads themselves so she clearly just forgot. When our food finally came out, my sons chicken tenders were drowning in grease. I had to pat them down and wipe down his plate with a napkin and that wasn't even enough. My chicken sandwich, which is normally delicious, had very little flavor. The so-called smoked chicken on it tasted boiled. It had no flavor, when in the past, it's been delicious. My husband said the meat on his reuben was dry and hard and it looked like it. It resembled jerky. When the check FINALLY came, I noticed the waitress had charged us for my son's drink which should have been included in the cost of the meal. We were in a hurry by this time so I didn't want to ask her to remove it from the bill and be gone another 10-15 minutes so I just paid for it so we could leave. So a kids meal that my son didn't touch ended up costing $10.75. Ridiculous. I really didn't want to tip at all but I can't stand being an a-hole so I tipped low. This restaurant that was once so great is now crap. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Took my family here when they came to visit. We actually thought it was Carraba's (which is next door), but didn't realize it until we got water and our menus, so we felt bad leaving.   Seems like it's typical American food but it's a bit more pricey.  My sister got a chicken tenders salad with honey mustard dressing and that was pretty good. I like that it had avocado in it too. My mom got catfish which turned out to be a deep fried fillet, but it was still good. They offer a lot of sides so she got coleslaw and glazed sweet potatoes. That was tasty. I got the baby back ribs and chicken combo with mash and baked beans. The ribs were sooo good, the meat just fell off the bone and it was so juicy. The chicken was ok, I thought it was going to be BBQ chicken, but it was more like roasted chicken, I wasn't a fan of the herbal rub on it. The mashed potatoes were alright, as were the baked beans. I think I like the sweeter baked beans like from armadillo willy's better, this one tasted more like chili.   The service was good, and overall I think my family was happy with their food. Maybe we lucked out with good service and decent food. The lady next to us ordered catfish and got chicken tenders. They ended up comping that to her which was nice. Too bad they didn't bring my mom the wrong order for her catfish. Then I'd give them five stars"}
{"text":"As my wife mentioned in her post, we were looking to try something new in the area and this was one of our many bookmarked places that had some great Yelp! feedback, so we decided to give it a try.   The restaurant itself was really nicely laid out and had plenty of space for groups from small to large.  I really liked the design, with exposed bricks, flame sconces, and heavy wood beams.  It has a very homey, cozy, earthy feel to it.   We were seated right away and our server let us know he'd be with us shortly.  After looking over the menu for a bit, we both decided on our picks. I chose the country fried steak with carrots and fries.  The portions were enormous!  The breading on the steak was a bit much for my personal tastes, but it was flavorful and otherwise well prepared.  The fries were crisp shoe-strings, somewhere between McDonald's and Steak 'n Shake in size (but far superior otherwise).  The carrots were perfectly cooked and had a nice glaze on them.  Over all very good, and more than I could eat!  My wife selected the Hickory burger with a side of the baked potato soup (the soup of the day special). The burger was cooked to the medium she ordered, and had two healthy sized slices of Canadian bacon on top of it. It was loaded with shredded cheddar.   Our server was helpful and took the time to answer a couple questions we had about the menu since we both have food allergies, even if it meant going to find the answer. The pricing is a bit high for options other than burgers / sandwiches, but the portion sizes are huge and the service is great, so for a nice date night out, it's a good option!"}
{"text":"Everything here is mediocre. Blah  The food is blah, the menu is a snore, the restaurant ambience is dark and boring  Mediocre all the way."}
{"text":"Daughter and I have been wanting to check this place out since we seen one in Mesa! So the family was in the area. (picking mommy's necklace up at Tiffany's) Noticed on the way to the FWY there was a Charleston's. I have checked this place out on the web, and only thought this was just a ribs, and burger joint. Something we all have been to. Boy was I wrong! I ordered their grilled pork chops, with garlic mash, and glazed carrots. Pork chops were awesome, cooked will done, with garlic and butter on top. I would order again anytime. Their garlic mash was very good, and mommy loved the glazed carrots. Daughter had the 1/2 ribs with fries, the meat was just falling off the bones, had plenty of meat. Wife had a cheese burger, with a salad. She loved the salad, and burger was good. Overall we had a great time, it does cost a little bit more. But it was well worth it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for a quick lunch before heading to a movie. We found the service to be poor and our food did not live up to the standards we had experienced at other Charleston's locations."}
{"text":"Ok, but not great. Food was good, but at $40 per person, why is there no free bread if you get a steak? Was charged $1 for the croissant. Looks cheap.  Steak was similar in size and quality to what is served at The Keg. Fries are similar to those served at Bobby Q (thin, crunchy, from a distributor).  Service in the bar area is incredibly lackluster and inattentive. The waitress was alerted to every service need by a random member of staff walking by that had to go ask her for a refill on a drink or that I was ready to order after waiting 10 minutes with a menu in hand."}
{"text":"Fantastic as usual. We had a very large party after a funeral. The staff were so accommodating and attentive. That's a hard feat for a party of our size! Kudos to the wait staff for being on top of our orders and providing superb service. The food is always fresh and tasty. I ordered the piccata and it didn't disappoint. Most piccata's are overly lemony or overly whine-y, theirs is perfect. For appetizers we also ordered the shrimp-scargo and a spicy shrimp dish that I can't recall the name, OMG SO DELICIOUS! Know that you'll be treated well and you will enjoy yourself here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Charleston. I was surprised at the high prices they charge for a very run-of-the-mill menu. The drinks were very expensive in the food was good but nothing to write home about. Our waitstaff was extremely professional and friendly. However, I will never go back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"I was unsure what to expect from Charlestons but overall it was pleasant.  I placed a takeaway order for Sirloin , Dynamit shrimp and a potato.  The steak was cooked alright but a little tough, Dynamit shrimp sauce was good but the shrimp were a little mushy. The potato was delicious. My order was ready when I got there and they have military discount! Service was quick and friendly and price was fair at under $30. I recommend if you're in the mood for steak and potato."}
{"text":"Moved to Mesa in June, 2017 and have been looking for a nice restaurant with good menu variety and pleasant setting. I eat out a lot and have tried many places but this one (so far) is at the top of my list. I'm a fan of salmon so that was my order this evening. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! Excellent! My daughter had the special for this evening ...  Hawaiian Steak. It too was great. Our server, Logan, has been with Charleston's for 7 years and was top notch. Will be going back! Great food, delightful ambiance, professional and ultra courteous servers - this was the nicest restaurant experience I've had since moving to Mesa."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we have eaten at Charleston's. We just got back from a trip and both of us wanted to pickup something good and we both thought of Charleston's!  We ordered a Trout Dinner and their famous rack of ribs dinner with a baked potato and Cole slaw. It was phenomenal and tasted just like it did 5-years ago (when we moved from the area)! It was all Perfect!  Great job Charleston's!"}
{"text":"New Years Eve can be a trying experience in a restaurant.  Charleston's had it wired tonight.  Service was excellent .  Our food outstanding.   Charleston's has a great menu that has something for everyone.  Sandwiches, huge  salads, seafood, chicken, pork chops and steaks  The dining has low lighting with comfortable booths.  Whether you are looking for just a nice dinner out or to celebrate a special occasion, give Charleston's a try.  I do not think you will be sorry."}
{"text":"I rarely give, if ever, 5 stars but I have to say that everything about this dinner was amazing. Right from the start the staff was both professional and friendly. Our server Holley was awesome, she made sure we were aware of all the specials and answered all of our questions about the menu and throughout the evening she entertained all of our silly questions about the paintings (when you go, you'll see what I mean)!  The manager Jeff even got into the conversation and we noticed that he came over when he noticed Holley talking to us for a while. That says a lot about their care for their dinner guests as I'm sure he wanted to see if everything was okay.   The food was incredible, very fresh, the steaks were perfectly cooked and tender. In fact, when the serve brought our steaks he asked us to cut into them first to make sure they were to our liking! Who does that?? My wife's prime rib was just a bit over medium rare and they took it back and within minutes had one on the table to her liking.   But the star of the dinner, oddly enough, was the baked potato! It's the best baked potato I ever had, with the inside perfectly cooked and the outside salty and crusty! Amazing!  The drinks were nice and stiff and enhanced our meal and our conversation!   This is not a place with a low end price point, but I felt everything it was worth it."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and it never disappoints. I have had probably 10 different items from their menu and I haven't found one I didn't love. If you are looking for good food and great service I highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Good food and service every time I've been here.  I really enjoy the Cesar salad and the steaks.  The entrance to the parking lot is goofy but don't let that stop you.    Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Just got done doing a date night with hubby here. Never been to any of their locations before! We got here about 7 on Friday and there was no wait. Our server was great. Really friendly and attentive. The husband got a French dip sandwich and I got a chicken pasta dish. Both were really good! Key lime pie was for dessert. I love key lime pie but honestly wasn't a huge fan of this one. It wasn't bad by any means but there were nuts in the crust which I think through me off. All in all great night out!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken, bacon, avocado ciabatta sandwich and fried okra.  The sandwich was amazing and the okra was some of the better okra I've had.  I really liked the ambiance of the place. There are real gas lamps on the brick walls, the table was big and round and the restaurant was dimly lit which gave it a cozy feel.  The server was very nice but the food took a while to get to us, considering how slow it was that night."}
{"text":"The salmon Cesar salad is awesome. Nice environment for lunch or dinner. I eat here a few times a year and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the last time we will eat here. We ordered chicken fried chicken without gravy... they brought us one with gravy..  my daughters boyfriend ordered a  burger with no bun and lettuce. They brought it with the bun.the last time was over a filet that took over 30 minutes.. For a high end restaurant They can get the simple stuff right."}
{"text":"Meet friends here for lunch and hand a wonderful lunch. One of the nice things is that they gave us enough time to visit and dine without being pressured to either order or finish."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before, but I like to get a few visits in before I write a review. I LOVE this restaurant. I've tried a different item on each visit, and have not been disappointed. The menu selection is minimal bu varied - they make maybe 20-25 things, but they make them so superbly! This visit I had the Chicken Piccata. This is a hard dish to get right for a lot of places, but the angel hair has perfectly done, not sticky, the chicken was so moist, and the capers and sauce were just amazing. The service is fast and friendly. A wonderful ambiance, perfect for a date night. We live quite a distance, but whenever we get a free night out from the kids, Charlestons is the first place on our list."}
{"text":"Horrific and insulting behavior is what my Friend and I experienced by that little girl who calls herself a \"waitress\" with the my  don't stink attitude. That's okay because I'm Young and Retired  YOU still HAVE to get up and go to WORK  As for the food, My steak was not Worth $30.00, it was tasteless and freezer burned. I've had better steak in the ARMY, that's how bad that tasteless Boot Leather was. This was our FIRST and LAST time here."}
{"text":"Change to 1 star called corporate the manager from this dump called 1 time no responce from corporate office so sad bye bye."}
{"text":"We arrived a little late like 840pm, and were seated immediately. We ordered slow cooked prime ribs and they were very well made, taste perfectly with J Lohr wine. Service was great as well; Nick took care of us very well, he explained everything. We enjoyed the wonderful dinner and will come back."}
{"text":"The food was solid and the service was excellent!  We ordered the Caesar salad, shrimp cargot, tortilla soup, chicken and ribs and also ribeye steak.  All were great, and I especially loved the fact that the steak was wood grilled leaving a wonderful flavor!  Would not hesitate to stop by here for a drink or food.   Thanks Bradley for your excellent service and the double scoop of vanilla bean ice cream!"}
{"text":"Ate an early supper here today in between hours of Christmas shopping.  We checked it on Yelp and saw that it averaged 4 stars.  It should have 5!  Great food, well prepared, fresh ingredients.  Attentive and sincere service.  Wonderfully warm, low light atmosphere.  My only gripe about today' meal pertains to our cocktails . . . both Manhattan's . .  . both watered down.  Beyond that my pork chops were incredible, perfectly grilled and served with some spectacular BBQ beans and outrageously wonderful garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife's blackened talapia was likewise grilled to perfection and accompanied by a colorfully tasty medley of fresh seasonal veggies.  We were completely satisfied with the portions but not uncomfortable though we opted against dessert which I will have to sample another day as I am a long standing fan of bread pudding.  This was our first visit here but it certainly won't be the last.  They have a varied and reasonably priced menu with plenty of appealing dishes from hamburgers to soups and salad.  It's an upscale, cozy eatery without being pretentious or over the top.  Great find.  Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"There is not much that can be said about this establishment.....Their name is well deserving of the beautiful Marquee above their building, not only great food but the servers are fantastic they are very familiar with the menu and are eager to please the customer.  This a 5 star establishment hands down....personally I wish I could give a 10 star recommendation.  YOU CAN'T GO WRONG HERE"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We were there early, seemed like an older crowd- and the waiter seemed like he thought we didn't belong there or that he was better than us- I suppose this is fancy Scottsdale so that may be normal (lol) but the food was perfect. I got a chicken Waldorf salad- the dressing was awesome. My husband got the chicken fried chicken - it looked amazing. Everything is made fresh/homemade and you can really tell. Huge portions and we also shared the keylime pie- yum!! Crust was perfect too."}
{"text":"Being an AZ native and traveling the world (especially the United States) consistently, when I return home, my first stop is at Charleston's for the grilled chicken and avocado club, a large side of honey mustard dressing, and the garlic mashed potatoes.  It is one of my favorite sandwiches on the planet.  I can not say enough good things about this restaurant.  They clearly hire well as all of their staff is clean cut, courteous, and congenial.    The atmosphere is nice, the booths are comfortable, it always seems to be crowded but never a wait . . .   I love this place."}
{"text":"For a chain, Charleston's is solid. I've never had a bad thing there and the portions are huge. That being said, they are a little pricey. You can't really walk out of there without spending at least $20 a person. Now the good. Get the spinach salad, it's always been my favorite, along with baked potato soup. Make sure to order some of the croissants if you didn't get them with your meal, you won't regret it.  This last time I decided to deviate and get the salmon. Delicious! The sauce on top and cucumber salad perfectly complimented the dish. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"The Place to go in North Scottsdale  Great food (especially the BBQ Ribs), reasonable prices, wonderful service (by Johnnie), and a great ambience.  We will most certainly go back.  Joseph Sherren"}
{"text":"Rib eye perfectly cooked, baked potato deliciously coated in salt....drinks perfect! Highly recommend for a great steak dinner in Mesa.  Our server Holly and Jeff the manager were both so attentive and professional....absolutely great meal."}
{"text":"Charleston's is a standard American restaurant in a strip-mall setting.  While it is free-standing, it's a chain restaurant with a clear suburban demographic target.  They feature steaks and prime-rib, salads, baby-back ribs, roast chicken, burgers and the like.  It is thoroughly a meat and potatoes place, with enough salads to address the request for \"health conscious\" offerings.  The sides are predictable - mashed potatoes, French fries, veggies like sugar-glazed carrots and zucchini in butter. Their mixed drinks are standard and of indifferent quality - for example, my most recent gin & tonic there was a bit sweet.  The hostesses and waitresses all dress in black, and say things like \"perfect\" a lot.  Their filet mignon is often quite good.  Their Caesar salad is surprisingly good with real Caesar dressing made from scratch.  The bar is not a welcoming place, but the main dining room is filled with warm dark booths that provide some intimacy and privacy - so the atmosphere there is quite good.  The prime rib is fine but not special.  The baked potatoes are good.  The soup of the day (and each day has it's own standard \"special soup\") tends to be quite poor, probably from sitting in a hot pot too long.  The baby-back ribs are fine - not special, but perfectly adequate.  I do find Charleston's a bit expensive for what they are - not outrageously so, but pricier than similar quality places in other suburban settings.  There's nothing wrong with Charleston's, but there's not much great about it either.  I've eaten there several times because it's a few-hundred yards from the hotel I've been staying in (the one our company asks us to use).  I'll go back because it's convenient and perfectly adequate - but it will never be a first choice place to eat."}
{"text":"Chases tons is an upper class establishment focusing on that finer dining atmosphere, proper service and white table cloth experience.  We found the steaks to be a solid 4 out of 5 in greatness which is good, but not quite worth the $38 a steak fee...  It is a good spot for a date or formal dinner meeting though..."}
{"text":"Great service, food price reasonable- smells great when you enter the front door, mesquite/ Kiawe --wish we had this in Honolulu"}
{"text":"I'm from Houston just here on business and looked up steakhouses and this place came up. With its high reviews decided to try it out, got the menu and found only 3 steaks. There was a sirloin, filet and prime rib, I opted for the filet med rare. The food came out great and the service was great as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We came to have dinner with family that are from here in Arizona.  It seemed pretty busy for a Sunday night.  The restaurant is nice.  It's a little dark, but not that that matters much, at least not to me.    Any way, the service is good, and so is the food. The portions are pretty big.  Especially for the kids meals.  I ordered chicken tenders for my two year old son, and he had enough on his plate to feed an adult.    I ordered the shrimp scampi, but I substituted the tomatoes it originally comes with for sautéed mushrooms. It was so good, I finished it even though I was already full half way through.  My husband ordered the the chicken Parmesan.  It was good, a little salty, but still good.  Well, I may be a little indifferent right now about things being salty because I'm pregnant.  My husband thought it was just fine if that makes any of a difference.    One of our family members tried to order ribs, but they were sold out.  And they were also sold out of rotisserie chicken.  I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  They are either so good they run out, or they are not well stocked.  Either way, someone in our party didn't get exactly what they wanted.    All in all, it was a pretty good visit.  We had good service and good food!"}
{"text":"For those that are in a rush: - great food (we tried salmon & Parmesan chicken) - ask your server for recommendations, they won't disappoint - expect a wait but know that it is worth it - if you don't feel like waiting, check the bar for seating!  Hubs & I went here for the first time tonight; there was a 20-25 minute wait, but we were seated after about 15 minutes.  It should be mentioned you can elect to scope out the bar and sit there if there is space available you don't want to wait.   We were seating at a comfy booth, and while waiting for our server we observed the overall aesthetic.  The lighting was low, and the brick walls, exposed wood beam ceiling, and finish on the tables made for a place I felt like I could be at for a while and feel comfortable.    Food was excellent.  I had the short smoked salmon, which was great!  It came served atop a sort of pickled cucumber salad, which was a nice freshness with the salmon & the server recommended the burgundy mushrooms so I went with those instead of the mixed veggies.  I loved the mushrooms, but think they would go better with steak or maybe chicken instead of salmon.  Hubby got the Parmesan crusted chicken, and he loved that as well, direct quote from him \"you know the chicken is tender when you can cut it with your fork\" - super moist and delicious. It came with a mozzarella, tomato, onion salad that I had to try as well!  Finally we had bread pudding for dessert, which also did not disappoint.  It was served warm and with a delicious type of... sauce?  It was almost like a warm, light whipped cream.. hard to explain but definitely good.    Service was outstanding.  Our glasses were never empty, our server made recommendations that were on pointe and everyone we interacted with from the staff was polite, if not friendly.    We left here in agreement: full bellies and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! The chicken fried chicken is the best I've ever had with the glazed carrots! My one negative is that it's a bit dark inside."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!  Took my friend who was planning this for weeks.  Did not even eat left ruining our night.  Go to Pigglys across parking lot great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Five stars well earned. My wife had the chicken fried chicken and I had the beef dip for lunch. Both meals were outstanding. The wait staff were on their game, the ambience of the restaurant and the execution of the lunch experience were SPOT ON. Handing out five stars doesn't come easily with me, but this was well deserved."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful as always.  Great menu mix of healthy and fun food.  The staff is always top notch!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review to support the restaurant, not to complain.  I took my staff here for our annual Christmas party.  We had heard good things and read the reviews, so decided to try it. We also have 2 gluten free staff members and had seen the gluten free menu online. I made reservations so we did not have to wait.  The wait staff took our drink order - 2 of the drinks arrived within a minute or so, the rest of the drinks took much longer - which we thought was odd since the place was not busy.  Our cocktails were ok the first time around, but the second time we had serious doubts as to what happened - the mojito was clearly almost all soda water with the tiniest bit of mint, and the martini was obviously watered down - my thought was it was left in the ice too long to chill it and then poured into my glass - tasted just like water - completely different than my first one.  Two staff members ordered wine - they came to the table at the same time - 1 glass with standard pour, and the other about half the amount - we thought it was a \"sampler pour\" and informed our wait staff.  He said both were standard pours, but it was obvious they were not the same.  Well, that was the end of our cocktail orders. Our waiter, who was very friendly and courteous, was uninformed about the gluten free menu - he didn't even know there was one - or what gluten free actually means when it comes to ordering safe food.  Our food was either mediocre or awful, and expensive.  The medium well steak was so overcooked my staff couldn't cut it - was burned and tough.  The trout was raw and slimy when it was delivered. Both meals went back and the next round was almost as bad.  The pork chops were ok, but nothing to rave about.  I asked to be refunded some of the meal - they agreed to the steak and the appetizers - but when my bill came they had changed their mind to a 5.00 credit for the drinks and a 26.00 credit for the appetizers.  My bill was over $300.00.  We all agreed we would not be back.  As small business owner I suggest the restaurant spend some time training their staff on their gluten free menu, how to make a good drink and better preparation of their food."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chains but the food here is always consistently good. This is standard \"American\", little of everything, place. It is a good place to have a lunch meeting if you want to try to please unknown tastes."}
{"text":"Such a family restaurant!  The spinach dip is the best I've ever had! The staff is excellent and the atmosphere is elegant but casual. I've been many times over the past ten years and I've never ordered something I haven't liked and they just get better and better!"}
{"text":"Me and my grandmother had a great time the fish and the porkchops were great but that bread pudding off the chain i'm visiting from Atlanta Georgia"}
{"text":"Our food was excellent, but the service was so atrocious that we will never go back. There were 4 in our party and our food was not brought out at the same time nor even close to each other. Finally 3 had finished eating and we had to keep asking for the 4 meal to arrive. Then we asked for 2 different desserts to share and that was messed up on the bill as well as the 2nd dessert was brought out when the first one was almost finished but it was the wrong dessert. We finally left with having received only the one dessert as the correct second one never did arrive. 2 of the diners had ordered the soup and salad combo and that seemed to cause them more difficulty than the prime rib order! Manager said they were sorry but made no attempt to offer a free dessert coupon or anything to encourage us to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and great service. Our server was very attentive but not annoying. I had the prime rib and it was like butter. The horseradish sauce was absolutely divine. Dimly lighted and overall great service and atmosphere. Parking gets a little tight as the evening progresses."}
{"text":"Huge portions-I was happy to split a meal with my mom. We had a Chicken Club salad-which was more than enough for both of us. Came with a croissant too...just to make sure it wasn't TOO healthy of a pick. My husband had a club sandwich and devoured it-and we had a side of mushrooms-because mushrooms are good. And they were. My dad also got a side of carrots-which the one-year-old was very excited about. Nice place...but there are too many other places out there to go again."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! My mom, aunt and I came here for a nice dinner and drinks and that is exactly what we got! We tried the margarita, flirtini and peach (the name escapes me) drinks and they were awesome. Well mixed, unique and very tasty!  We ordered the guacamole and chips and while it wasn't bad, there was definitely something missing. I salted it and it helped a little but the guac had very little flavor. Skip it.  My mom ordered the Rueben said it was \"fabulous\". They leave the dressing on the side which is nice as it keeps the bread from getting soggy. My aunt ordered the sirloin and said it was cooked perfectly. She substituted glazed carrots for her side and was very pleased with them. Thumbs up all around. We will definitely be back here again. Great service, fair prices for the large portions, great food and a nice outdoor patio- you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"With all the Barrett Jackson crowds we were treated incredibly well and I would totally recommend this restaurant any time.   On a Saturday night, we made a reservation and due to some technicalities we didn't get seated until almost 40 mins after the reservation. The General Manager, Mike, repeatedly apologized and offered to give us some appetizers. When we finally sat down, we were immediately served (even before we were handed the menus) chips and salsa, spinach dip and coconut shrimp with an amazing orange marmalade with horseradish.  He also bought our bottle of wine and my drink. After checking in on us several times we had an incredible dinner.   I'd like to thank Mike for taking time out of managing a huge crowd to attend to us in such a manner that wasn't overbearing."}
{"text":"Dinner with another couple. Chicken Parmesan, shrimp scampi, fried chicken were excellent. Belinni outstanding Great service  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed the food and ambiance at Charleston's, but won't patronize a restaurant using the \"bait and switch\"scam. I checked their menu online, but when I tried to order an item featured, the server told me they no longer had it on the menu. I showed her the internet version of the menu and she said it was a \"corporate issue.\""}
{"text":"This place was just okay.  I didn't know what to expect from the food when I sat down, the atmosphere was more Sizzler than Durant's & the majority of the crowd appeared to be taking advantage of the senior discount.  That said, the food was pretty good.  I got the chicken fried steak with garlic mashed; the portion was big, it was tasty, and service was ok.  Will I go back?  Maybe... but I won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Not only had I never heard of this chain, since it's kind of tucked away, I didn't know it was so close to where I live / work!  My friend Kyle is leaving soon to move back to the great Northwest and invited the roomies out for a steak night.  We arrived and I immediately enjoyed the ambiance.  Dark stone walls with fire sconces and low lighting, perfect for a steakhouse.  Our server was friendly and we decided to get the shrimpcargot as an appetizer.  This tasty dish has shrimp, butter & garlic - in an escargot platter with baked Havarti cheese on top.  The combination of flavors make this one of the finest shrimp appetizers I've ever had!  **IF YOU'RE HERE, ORDER LIKE THREE OF THESE, you won't regret it**  Decided to go with the famous French dip as an entrée and that did not disappoint.  The fries that came with were shoestring and perfectly crispy.  The side salad was fresh and delicious - and I had 1/2 of the sandwich to take home for lunch the next day.  I'll be back and will likely get the same exact meal because everything was spot on!"}
{"text":"It's late I'm hungry....What the heck is Charleston's?  Unfortunately, this place is located in the corner of the corner.  Yes, if you need to find this place please update your GPS.  Food was okay at best, but the service was what made me smile.  I had the Hickory Burger and my mate had the fish of the day Tilapia.... Fishy she said.  Yes, Tilapia is a fish, but my favorite was the deep fried okras yum.  The place was kind of old fashion...I wasn't sure if I was supposed to sign the Declaration of Independence or order me some Sam Adam's - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service, the price for the quality of the food is outrageous. Our server asked if we like the soup, when we said no, she removed our plates without a word, not a question, nothing. No water for 15 min. Enchiladas at an American steak house? 4 steaks at a steak house? I know it's corporate, but give us paying customers some decent quality food for the 27 dollar dishes. Don't go, save your money head to long horn on alma school."}
{"text":"Another great Yelp find! They are a step up from the Outback type restaurants with the delicious food of a more pricier steakhouse without the pretension. Everything we ordered was fantastic. Their steaks were done perfectly (not something many restaurants do well) and their garlic mashed potatoes were phenomenal. Make sure to try their baked potato soup... It's to die for!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find a Charleston's in Arizona. Tried the one in Mesa during a dinner rush and it was amazing! Decided when we were in Scottsdale to try it out. Sadly I was disappointed, it wasn't busy in fact fairly slow. I ordered my usual chicken which is my favorite! Unfortunately they way over cooked it. I hate sending things back in fear they'll be worse which is what happened. So I left without eating kind of a bummer but it happens. Manager was nice to us.  Update: The management staff at Charleston's in Scottsdale followed up with me directly to rectify my concerns and I will definitely go back for another meal!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to find there's a Charleston's in Arizona. Love this place out of state and stumbled on it when a friend was in town for work. Their chicken is amazing, had a minor salad mishap but it was fixed quickly and our service was wonderful! Always brought new drinks before I could even think to ask. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant. I've had a number of menu items. Every one seems to be purposefully made by scratch and taste like a scratch kitchen. This place ain't cheap. It comes with a price but the portions are not skimpy. The chx fried chx is two breasts and a heap of mashed potatoes and sugar baked carrots. I usually opt for a cup of soup. Sundays they do their kale and chx soup. My opinion the best soup ever!!  Burgers are lean and good. Salads are not petite. The Waldorf salad is off the hook plumpalishis!  Croissants come with the salad. Nothing done cheap here.  Definitely a good solid place to eat. Where everyone will walk away happy and plump."}
{"text":"I have been off work, injured, so I sat down and starting reviewing all these places we have gone to since I have nothing better to do then eat. So you see I have a lot of reviews , most written in a couple of days, but let me tell you this, these are honest reviews. So,  let me tell you about Charleston's. This is such a nice place. We go to either this location in Chandler, or the Mesa location, on Stapley. You can't go wrong at either location. We have been coming here for years. We love it here. The best way to start your meal with a great appetizer called \"Shrimp Cargot\" OMG. its so good, hot out of the oven, shrimp smothered in cheese and butter, so gooey, so good.  I now will tell you that the best ribs you can get, are here!!!! Really, no joke! So tender, so ....great!!  Burgers are good, chicken, and of course, steaks are wonderful. Come late afternoon, its nice and cool, cozy, and no bright lights. Just relax with your wife, or the kids, yes kids will love the food as well. Sometimes we have to take the kids somewhere nice too. Doh!!!!!! I give this place a giant Woo Hoo!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a baby shower and the food is decent but not good. Service is great tho! I would suggest eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"What happened to service and food quality?  I have been coming here since it opened in Mesa at least for ten years or longer.  Always impressed with freshness and quality of food. Unfortunately this past Saturday for lunch, food quality and service were lacking which was very surprising.  My wife ordered a chicken salad. The chicken was dry and old and the salad not really fresh. I ordered a side salad and it was extremely old tasting. My roast chicken was also dry and with little flavor.  Service was lacking, server did not return and ask about food following the food delivery.  With a relatively pricey menu for lunch I expect outstanding food quality. Not sure what is happening here but this was well below par."}
{"text":"My family loves coming here!  I have also come for lunch with friends and brought out of town guests here for several meals.  It is pretty upscale and the service is always stellar.  My husband likes to order a couple of baskets of the delicious croissants to start.  They are light and flaky and my kids can't get enough!  He usually gets baked potato soup and the French Dip sandwich.  My kids like that as well, but will sometimes order the chicken strips.  I  highly reccomend the Champagne Chicken Salad.  It is the best!! I have also tried the chicken and bbq ribs and that has been outstanding as well.  The last time I was there I ordered the Grilled Salmon with glazed carrots.  I will never order anything ever again.  This was my favorite meal there, hands down!  Charleston's is a restaurant that we all enjoy!"}
{"text":"I swear I had one of the best Reuben sandwiches ever. It was packed with corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese layered between two buttery rye slices and thousand island dressing on the side. Along with hot crispy french fries. Man I was in caloric heaven LOL. I could only eat half of my sandwich as it really was packed with all of the above. My coworkers all seemed to enjoy their meal with majority of them getting the special of the day which was a roast beef sandwich in which the roast beef was piled high between some of the biggest buttery croissants I have ever seen. Another coworker got the chicken strip salad and while three more got the chicken avocado sandwich. I am telling you, they did not skimp on the servings that is for sure.   The prices were decent for lunch and service was fantabulous. I will definitely be coming back again and trying dinner soon."}
{"text":"My husband loves the atmosphere at night with the candlelight & mellow ambiance. He enjoys going there for a steak so we go once in a while. My daughter & I split a chicken quesadilla and it was a pretty small portion compared to some other places we have been to.  We did not have trouble getting seated right away & the service was good"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this location and everything was great. We barely parked in the to go parking and we were immediately greeted by an employee with all smiles. Our order was right and food was hot. Food was really delicious!"}
{"text":"The reviews on Yelp were extremely accurate. My wife and I were on vacation to Phoenix for our anniversary an I need a dinner to seal the deal. My had the Bison Burger and I had the roasted chicken.  Both meals were off the hook. The Perfect Margarita was one of the best we've had.  Top it all off with their bread pudding."}
{"text":"OK, I have been a regular customer for a number of years. However since the snowbirds came to Arizona for the Winter I have had two negative experiences. The last one was last week. Arrived late, 8:30PM, so it was not busy. Ate in the bar and we ordered the prime rib and rib dinner. We waited forever after we ordered and would probably still be there if I had not flagged down the server. Once dinner arrived, my prime rib was mostly fat and what was not fat was raw...not under cooked but raw. Then my baked potato did not come and when I brought it to the servers attention, she freaked out, ran off to get it and brought it back right before we were ready to leave! The ribs were over cooked and dry. This horrid experience was brought to the servers attention and she just smiled and walked away.   I think I need a break from Charleston's. Now with all the tourists in ton they don't need my business but in the Summer when things slow down, maybe someone will realize that it is the locals who keep you going. Big difference from my July 203 review....Oh yeah, it was the Summertime."}
{"text":"Average in every way, seems like a spot that is dying but food is average and menu has some good stuff."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, price was not too expensive for the area. However, food was very average at best. Nothing to write home about.   They discontinued chicken fried steak that I loved. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service and even better food. Steak mignon cooked perfectly. Relaxed dinning experience. We will go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The bread pudding here is AMAZING. Delicious food and great service. They never let my drink get low and kept the refills coming. They have something for everyone. From salads to ribs. We started with the queso dip. I had the ribs (fall off the bone tender) fried okra and mashed potatoes. He had the mahi-mahi, rice and veggies. For dessert I had the bread pudding (shown) and he had the carrot cake."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I love charlestons!!! I have never had a bad experience with service or quality of good! EXCEPTIONAL!! I am always pleased with their staff and food! So glad I am near by this restaurant"}
{"text":"Very good food   Awesome service   Price a little steep for the type of food  I will return."}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the past couple of months. Food is always delicious and service is impeccable. Short of the coffee being brewed like dishwater (waitress said something was wrong with their machine, but still charged us), everything was top notch."}
{"text":"Amazingly great happy hour. So classy. Great friendly staff too. Clam chowder Fridays are to die for."}
{"text":"The food is not quite as good as you would expect for the price. The ambiance is basically like Olive Garden, which again is disappointing for the prices.  At the Charleston prices, they could stand to squeeze fewer patrons in (thin out the number of tables), so I'm not forced to listen to kids arguing over iPads and chicken nuggets.  I guess I liked this place the first time when I was with a bigger group. It just isn't a great place for intimate dining."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently and was pleasantly surprised. This is a casual restaurant and the attire of some of the patrons proved the point. So inappropriately dressed! However, the food was good and the service was excellent. I had the chicken salad. It was delicious Plenty of lightly fried chicken chunks. It was so big, I took most of it home and had it for dinner. It came with a croissant which was hot out of the oven. Was that good!  I probably would not come for dinner, too casual for me, but for lunch it is a winner."}
{"text":"They had amazingly quick service during lunch! The servers were VERY polite, almost to the point of being obnoxious. I ordered the daily special--bacon cheeseburger--which came out hot, fresh, and delicious, though the fries were heavily over-salted. Our drinks were also quickly refilled without us asking, which was nice but unfortunately their tea basically tasted like water. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I actually have buyer's remorse even several days after eating here.  High prices for not a lot of food.  We both were hungry about an hour after eating here for dinner.  No bread before our entrees..me and my fiance were staring at each other starving, waiting for our food.  We would have ordered a Cesar Salad..but they didn't have one on the menu (I thought that is standard steakhouse fare).  Our waitress was somewhat of an apparition.  We asked for horseradish to go with the primerib and she asked a follow up question and then never came back with it.  We couldn't even flag her down to ask for it again...although randomly without a word she would bring drink refills even though we didn't need or ask for them yet?!?  I didn't feel the loaded bake potato had enough topping...so I guess it wasn't that loaded after all.  Overall disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I had the meatloaf and the brown tomato gravy on top was fantastic. Hubby had the Catfish and said it was great. Large portions...we didn't finish. Server was very attentive."}
{"text":"We have only had delivery from Charlestons. But I have to say it always has been consistently great !! Whoever is packing the orders takes care not to screw anything up & pays attention to detail. The prime rib sandwich is a 5* , also the fried chicken dinner. We love the Walt's chicken salad , hubby thinks it's one of the best salads he ever has had.  Ordered the ribs one time but it is too big of a portion. Wish they had 1/2 slab on the Postmates take out menu along with other appetizers. Felt the spinach dip was way over priced for what you got.  Key Lime pie is great & enough for two. Wonderful food !! Can not wait to go there in person."}
{"text":"I Love everything I have tried and each time I go I try something new. The seafood stew is amazing. I love the limeade, the cheese bread, Cassava are excellent appetizers. My friend had the acorn squash, he loved it, my husband had the Bobo shrimp, I had the Brazil Nut crusted Halibut, it was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner looking for some reasonably priced steak... which is exactly what we got. Service was excellent.  The group ordered - Fried okra : some pieces were not edible due to the rough skin. - Chips and guac : chips were eh but guacamole was delicious. - 10oz prime rib : it was OK... a bit salty but I liked that the 'dressing' was on the side. - chicken and ribs : what a huge portion of food for $22 !   Had a nice time but nothing too memorable here."}
{"text":"My family has been going to this location for years.  Usually it's spot on.  Went to dinner last night (12/12/15) at the Scottsdale location off Frank Lloyd Wright  and had the worst service ever.  I had to bus my own dishes, ice tea was always empty and they forgot my son's food.  No one checked on us to even notice we were missing part of our order.  When we asked to speak to the manager, he had a deer in the headlight look with no apology.  Whatever happened to customer service?  What ever happened to taking responsibility and apologizing when one does make a mistake.  The waitress when were were all done with our food asked if we wanted the missing food.  Well, hell, yeah we do, my 7 year old son was still hungry!!  Very disappointing.  We will find a new family restaurant as there are many choices."}
{"text":"We've come 3 years in a row on my daughters birthday 21-22 and yesterday was 23 yrs old. We split the shrimp scampi and (bummed out they ran out of salmon) we shared the trout instead. Actually we were happy to try something new and wonderful. We got the trout blackened, it was great!  Desserts to go were all packed up nicely. As for our server Andrew he was the best server we've ever had. He ddnt blink or bat an eye when I felt maybe I was asking too much of him, a few times."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  It has a variety of choices for all.  I definitely would recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Really good.  Great bartenders, and the food was awesome!  Came with a group of friends (10 of us).  Server split the bill perfectly.  All the food came out correct, and perfectly done!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, (we had the pork chops). Portions were more than generous. Wait service was incredible. This is a first class act and we will return."}
{"text":"This review is for my dine in experiences at Charlestons. As can be seen in a previous review I'm no fan of their \"To Go\" service. Every time I've had a sit down meal at Charlestons I've left satisfied with the service and the food. The waiters are always helpful and friendly. Most of the time we order entrees that are no longer on the menu. My daughter religiously orders the chicken and ribs combo. She loves this. I'll order the same or a sandwich.  The food is always consistent and delicious. The only dessert we've had is the bread pudding. It's so good that we've never thought of ordering anything else!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I can only come to Charlestons when I'm traveling and after a year I'm back. I have been here a week and been to Charlestons for dinner twice and lunch once. You can't beat this restaurant for: fresh, great tasting food, preparation and quality for the money. I don't mind paying money, but it needs to be worth it. When I've had a long day of working and I need a meal that will be fresh, taste great and I won't be disappointed, I come the Charlestons and they never disappoint. I usually do curbside and the service is impeccable. Nice, friendly staff that put your food in the backseat and actually seem to like their jobs. Today was lunch and I went out on a limb and ordered a new item. Ceasar Salmon salad. Delish. Look at the pic. Comes with that beautiful honey drizzled croissant and the greens are actually GREEN and there are a lot of them. Real Parmesan cheese shreds (not that horrible can powder), fresh firm tomato and crisp red onion and cucumber. Don't get me started on the scallion dressing! The salmon was also great; tender, moist with a beautiful char. Just opening the container at work and the picture is a feast for the senses. This is what good food looks and even better tastes like. In a time when so many restaurants are all hype and no substance and they seem to do nothing more than take your money and you feel robbed from the experience, Charlestons after 10 years has maintained and continually exceeds my expectations. I don't like to think I'm picky, but I do expect that when I pay my money, the effort expended by the retailer should be evident. Go, eat, enjoy. You won't be disappointed. By the way, my fav item: Catfish with French fries and broccoli or glazed carrots. The side salad with the garlic dressing is bomb as well."}
{"text":"This place is TOP NOTCH.  My manager had lunch there with a team member and forgot his credit card.  He was flying back to sf bay directly after lunch that day, so no time to course correct.  To make situation even tougher, he had a trip to NY a couple of days LATER.  I had to get that card asap or it was going to be bad news.  I called the restaurant in a panic to see what could be done.  A manager named Candice saved the day!  She confirmed she had the card and agreed to ship it out to us overnight.  I sent her the shipping label and she took time to drive it over to fedex in time to make the drop.  She even emailed me to confirm she dropped it off.  We received the card just in time for his NY trip and all was right with the world.  Thank you Candice!!!!  We will be BACK.  Not only did my manager love his lunch, this place is an example of what customer service SHOULD be.  Make a reservation and support this place today!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch, Was there tonight. Never had a bad experience. Always get the filet because, well, I LOVE IT! My steak is always  perfect and the salad is always soooooo good. They have these croissants with honey, they are amazing, I totally recommend. Drinks always pack a great punch!  I feel stuffed. Our server was amazing (as always) and we were told 5 times (every staff member we passed) to have a good night as we were leaving. Everyone is so friendly that works there, and pretty too. Its Dim, but most steak houses are. Noise level never bothered me nor was it distracting.  ONCE we didn't get any croissants with our salads and my guy asked the greeter on the way out if they no longer served them, she was SO apologetic that she offered to pack us up some to take home. It was a VERY nice gesture and thats how awesome they always are."}
{"text":"Customer service: 5/5 Our waiter, Ace, was awesome!! Extremely attentive to our party's requests. Gave excellent recommendations about our food and cracked a few jokes  Food 4/5 Their house salad was wonderful and had ample toppings. My clam chowder, however, was soooo clammy. It could have just been an off night. But, I tasted my fiancés chicken fried chicken was SO bomb!! The crunchiness of the chicken combines with that thick, rich white gravy sauce was so sinful. That was the table favorite   Wait time: 3/5 We went on a Friday night. My uncle said that there usually isn't that long of a wait, but we waited for about 40 min. But, it was 7pm on a Friday night, so we took our chances with that one.   Dessert: 10/5 Definitely definitely get the carrot cake. Best carrot cake I've ever had in my life! Two different servers told us to get it because it was the life changing."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Charleston's for years, and celebrate all milestones there. We have always been very impressed with not only the ambiance of the restaurant, but also the waitstaff, the managers and the food.  We typically order the filet mignon, a side salad with that amazing sticky croissant, a side of burgundy mushrooms, drinks and dessert and have never been disappointed.  Heading over to Charlestons this week to celebrate my birthday, and I can hardly wait!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service; recommend the roast chicken and ribs dinner and the key lime pie desert, yum :)"}
{"text":"Great place and good location. Parking is a little tight due to the number of eateries nearby.  They take reservations, nice. I had the grilled porkchops.  Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Best Baked Potato Soup ever! I went here last night with the GF and my folks. Everybody really liked what they had. The GF got prime rib. I have never seen a piece of Prime Rib so thick. It was good. Mom got the Chicken Piccata. Two chicken breast artichoke hearts, asparagus, lemon, and capers. She loved it. Dad got the Rib & Chicken combo. This plate is amazing. The ribs were good and had some of the best BBQ sauce I have ever had. The chicken that comes with it is huge and really really good and you get two pieces. This meal could easly be split by two people. Im so going back for this meal. I got the special of the night which was Rainbow Trout Blackened and served with rice, veggies, and salad which I subed for soup. This fish was great and again a huge portion. It was a whole fish. For dessert we got the Bread Pudding. This is THE BEST BREAD PUDDING I Have EVER HAD. My dad is a bread pudding connoisseur and it is the best he has ever had. The presentation was great and the taste even better.   So overall everyone very happy, very full cause they do not short you on food here. I will be back for that rib & chicken combo and of course the bread pudding. Its just that good. Service was great. The wait on a Friday night at 7 pm was only ten min. The prices range from $15-25 for entrees. The rib and chicken combo was only $18. So worth it. The atmosphere is comfortable and warm."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We ate here last Wednesday, with our friends from Canada. We've always loved the food, but our friends can be a tad particular. Charlestons didn't disappoint. I tried the cheeseburger this time, and loved it. The other meals were equally as delicious. However, the icing on the cake was our server Victoria. This young lady was honestly the smartest and funniest server we've ever had at any restaurant. Thanks Victoria, for making our night fantastic."}
{"text":"I had the filet and it was enjoyable.  I would have been disappointed if it came with a $50 price tag from a fancy steakhouse but for the price it was good.  Menu was basic and I struggled to find something that sounded really good to eat.  Left happy with the steak.  Brownie dessert was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"The food is consistent and very good. The croissants are a must have...trust me, order them!  We all had seafood dishes tonight; the catfish, blackened Mahi and Blackened trout and all came out great.  We enjoy the atmosphere and typically enjoy the customer service. Which brings me to my star rating rather than 5. The server was slow and inconsistent and found it difficult to keep out glasses full of drinks.   All in all, this is a nice place and we will continue coming back."}
{"text":"I loved this location for many, many years.  Tonight, the food was OK, but the service was really wierd.  After a large, loud, birthday party left at about 9:10 PM, all the wait staff stopped waiting on customers, and began frantically cleaning up the restaurant. It was 45 minutes before closing, but our drinks were empty, we were only half way done with our dinners, and the atmosphere became...Hurry up and Get Out, we want to close.  No more drinks, no more service, at all.  Service had come to a coplete haslt. Suddenly, a waiter rushed over to our table and reached around to drop off our bill on the table, without saying one word.  We were not done with our meals, had not been offered or ordered desert, offered boxes, or given drink refills.  I had to struggle to finally flag down a server to ask why we were being rushed out.  The manager came by, but, I did not feel he was truly apologetic at all, and I found his responses and tone very condesending.  The worst part, was that before the meal I was just saying Charlestons was one of the few places left with excellent service, and even though it costs quite a bit more than average, the friendly service makes it worth dining there.  The manager gave me a free dessert, which I took to go, as I felt I would have been holding the team up from getting out of there, if I ate dessert there, or much less, wanted to enjoy my dessert with coffee.  The whole experience ruined the night, and left me with an upset stomach."}
{"text":"My work had decided to have our 5th year anniversary dinner here . Over all waiters were awesome great customer service. Always make sure we had drinks and if anything else was necessary. Also being a party of 30, just awesome... although the day after not so awesome . I had the worse stomach ache and spent the next couple of days in bed . The shrimp had a funky smell to it and also a weird taste after a couple of bites I knew it was best not to eat it but it was just enough to get sick!!"}
{"text":"Some friends of ours invited us to this location for dinner as we were just arriving in town. It was about a mile from our hotel, which made it nice and easy to find.   When we arrived we were sat at a table very quickly, the server came up to our table just as quick to make sure we had a drink orders. The server made sure to give us plenty of time to scan the menu. We have plenty of time for conversation and to make our pics for dinner. The server took our orders and within about 20 minutes our dinners were hitting the table fresh and hot.  Of course we had a chance to order dessert but after our meals we were completely full. The bill came and much to our surprise, the cost of our meals were very affordable.  So if you're in the area this is one of those restaurants you have to come too. The menu has a good variety, they have a great bar, and plenty of seats for everybody."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to go eat. I was hesitant at first due to the name, location, and food type. The reviews do the place justice. It was really good food. You also got a good portion. There wasn't too much or too little food. Which is really nice to me as I hate when restaurants try to give you 3 times the amount of food you really need. To me it seems like a waste when they do that. The server was very nice and very helpful. My wife usually has a hard time choosing what she wants to eat and the server helped her choose what she would like best. Plus everything is so fresh tasting and not packaged/frozen tasting. I would definitely recommend this place for sure. We will be back before we leave the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, with the authentic gas lamps, just like in Charleston, South Carolina.  Their best meal is the baby back ribs.  Side salad comes with bacon and a croissant!  So far all the food has been great.  The last time, I noticed the prime rib quality slipped a bit.  So I hope the management can intervene and assure the previous great quality and great value."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! The service was amazing and the food was delicious! I had the chicken fried chicken for my main dish and bread pudding for dessert and I was very happy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is such a pretty restaurant. We went here for my birthday and everything was delicious! I had the top sirloin with the baked potato and it was outstanding. Our server Statton was fantastic! I had a really good dessert as well! I'm not sure what it was but it was something with a brownie and it was so good!"}
{"text":"We were looking to try something new in the area and this was one of our many bookmarked places that had some great Yelp! feedback, so away we went! The restaurant itself was really nicely laid out and had plenty of space for groups from small to large. We were seated right away and our server let us know he'd be with us shortly.    After looking over the menu for a bit, we both decided on our picks. I opted for the Hickory burger with a side of the baked potato soup, which was the soup of the day special. The burger was cooked to the medium I ordered, and had two healthy sized slices of Canadian bacon on top of it. The shredded cheddar was the big winner for me on this burger. The portion sizes are huge here, so be prepared to eat a ton, or get a box!  Our server was really nice and took the time to answer a couple questions we had about the menu since both the husband and I have food allergies. The pricing is a bit high for options other than burgers / sandwiches, but the portion sizes are huge and the service is great, so for a nice date night out, it's a good option!  Overall: A Good burger, nice server, and huge portions!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim because I remember liking this place before and we were in that area. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was really tasty and flavorful.  The service was good.  The location is in the AMC theater plaza area and there is lots of parking.  If i didn't live so far away, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner here with friends recently.  We sat in a booth and enjoyed a couple of glasses of Wine before dinner.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go with:  Spinach & Artichoke Dip, $10 BBQ Baby Back Ribs (w/Fries & Beans), $22  The Spinach & Artichoke Dip was pretty good.  We shared the dish between 4 people and it was enough for all of us.  The Baby Back Ribs were pretty good.  They fell right off the bone, just how I like them.  I wouldn't say they were the best I've ever had, but they were pretty good.  The service was very good as well.  The server realized that we were there to enjoy each other's company, so she didn't rush us.  She also made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty....a good way to stay on my good side!  Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"We come here all the time! Today the service was awful! Sunday evening. The place is dead and we are still waiting 45 mins for dinner and only 5 of the 7 people at our party have our food. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Just ate there and was so impressed. Spinach artichoke dip was great. Filet was perfect. Chili was great. Service was great. Cesar salad so good and the amazing croissant that came with was to die for! We also had done garlic shrimp appetizer that was great and oh yeah, the frozen peach Bellini was fantastic too. Definitely will go back, so many other things looked great"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 people and needed a nice place that would accommodate everyone in our groups dinner needs :) the menus was very diverse, here was something for everyone. And the prices were very reasonable. The dress was causal. Service was quick and everyone's meal came out the way they ordered it . I would definitely recommend this place to Amy family looking for a place that serves the whole family !"}
{"text":"Chicken. Fried. Steak. Do it. Only a few places in AZ do this dish right and Charleston's definitely is one of them. Coupled with delectable red potato mash and grilled candied carrots, the portion size is more than generous. I like to get the dish with a side of fried okra for a taste of southern goodness. The chicken fried steak is literally the only thing I get here, but I am sure the rest of the menu is as tasty.   Service here is also pretty delectable. The grub buddy and I never have to wait for a table and are always greeted with a smile. The waiting staff is always on fleek with drink service and always make sure we are good. Decoratively speaking it reminds me of my grandma's 80's dining room. This is okay because it actually fits the clientele.  Remember - chicken fried steak. Try it and be satisfied."}
{"text":"we come here just for the baked potato soup... its just delicious... make sure to ask for crackers... they taste great in the soup. the chicken caesar salad is also amazing... i get blackened chicken on top and it comes with a croissant bread sooooo yummy. a bowl of the soup and a caesar salad is all i need and its pretty filling. ive had the burger from here and its pretty good and the french fries but the soup and salad is so filling i never really try anything else. the people there are welcoming and its usually packed on a weekend however we never really had to wait for a table. i usually come here for lunch and get take out a bit pricey for just soup and salad but its so good youll want to come back again just for that"}
{"text":"Loved my recent visit, every aspect was exceptional. From the artichoke dip to the never had better ever bread pudding. Once you added the croissants I lacked nothing.    The service was stellar, pleasant, timely and gracious. I was extremely impressed with whom I am assuming was management. A table across from us had opened up, and instead of waiting on another employee, this manager with the utmost of detail, wiped down the table and booth seats as if it was the most important initiative of the day. You don't generally see management jumping in to do that job, but it left a very favorable impression on me. It told me that they care. So thank you!  The pudding was spectacular  but that memory topped the cake and will have me coming back again soon."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were in Mesa Az to visit our good friend and we were looking for a nice Steakhouse and I clicked on you're website all we can say is Everything was Perfect ! From the Waiter Lane to the General Manager Michael when we come back to town from San Diego we will be sure to stop by again ! I've read other reviews here on your Restaurant and they don't do you Just !! My husband and friend said best Service by all here thank you all for such great service and delicious food !!  We will be sure to tell our friends about your Restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"Heard of good thing about Charleston's so decided to make a trip out. It was located near the mall with AMC theatres. I heard about the prime rib and the Walt's champagne chicken salad. The waiter said those two dishes would be plenty for two and he was right. The salad portions are huge and the steak is also a decent size with two sides. I would agree with the positive reviews on the steak and salad. Steak was melting in your mouth and the salad had all the right crunchiness with the zingy dressing. Overall it was a great experience. I will try to go back again to try out other items."}
{"text":"I always get the Chicken Ciabatta sandwich. Smoked chicken, havarti, peppers and chipotle. Sooo good! Nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our first time here at the ambience was great especially in the winter it made for a cozy night. Hubby and I started off with the croissants that came with honey and butter which was amazing a super must try. The server we had was very knowledgeable and explain the dishes to us. Our server was also friendly. I has been ordered the catfish and he said it was good not the best but good. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with marinara and pasta it came with a side of salad. The crust on my chicken was a little thick which was a bit much but the chicken itself was absolutely delicious. The pricing was reasonable and they also offer a pretty large military discount. We will definitely be back here. You must absolutely have the croissants with honey butter but I warn you it's easy to over indulge."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  We went on a Friday evening and the restaurant was packed. We opted for the patio, sitting under a heat lamp.  Our waiter was excellent and we enjoyed happy hour drinks with our  entree. We definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent in every way! Service gets an A+. The waiters were so efficient in refilling our drinks and getting our food on the table with perfect timing. The food was fantastic.  The spinach artichoke dip and their house salad with champagne vinaigrette & croissant  are amazing! Their filet and mushrooms just melt in your mouth! And their bread pudding is to die for! We live in Tucson but we'll definitely make the trip back to Chandler just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale - though it's quite a bit north, it's worth the drive.  It's an old school American style restaurant - really good food - reasonable prices.  Not loud.  WE go there every time we visit Scottsdale.  I love their chicken salad - comes with pineapple, dates, all sorts of delicious flavors.  I ordered one as an appetizer, and asked them to serve 1/2, and box up the other 1/2 for lunch the next day.  They happily obliged!    A great choice for the night out."}
{"text":"We love Charleston's! Dined there too many times to count! Recently at this location we had two negative experiences. Today we tried their spinach artichoke dip. First bite was perfect. No problem. Second bite immediately became attached to the roof of my mouth and was far too hot to eat. Severe burns to roof of mouth! No warning that it would be this hot and first bite was fine. Should have been warned or cautioned!!!! Nothing!!! Roof of moth began sloughing skin immediately! Worst roof of mouth burn injury I've ever had by far. Not happy!!!! Also and recently a few weeks ago we picked up a large to go order and they left out several items! Charlestons - excellent .... this location not so good. I recommend avoiding it."}
{"text":"Just back from a dinner at Charleston's. Appetizer was good but my wife's prime rib was tough and my burger was raw even though I asked for well done. Mentioned this to our waitress who said she told the manager and apparently it was comped. Wouldn't you think a manager would come to the table to discuss the situation??? Hate to say, but probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friends daughter works here so we ate here on her evening off. Seems a very popular place with a dark interior that could probably use some sprucing up.  Reminds me a lot of your typical chain place but the food was reasonably priced and the wait staff top notch.  I had one of the burgers and baked beans. My burger topped with cheese, Canadian bacon and chopped onions.  They enjoyed the shrimp linguini which looked good as well. We also shared an appetizer of spinach dip which was enough for all of us. Management seemed great and the bathrooms clean. Overall great experience and a mid-low price place that isn't too hard on the budget."}
{"text":"My husband and I has been to this restaurant several times in the last few months.  We always get the ribs which are the best we have ever had.  The service is outstanding. The manager always comes to the table to make sure everything was satisfactory. If there are any issues at all, they are corrected immediately. We plan to return often."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with two girlfriends to start off our girls' night, what a mistake! Service was terrible all around; all the girls had a terrible attitude. I don't know if it's because we were younger than the rest of the clientele in there or not, but it was just bad. The manager was helpful, but we still wouldn't be back.  We had to ask for refills and only got one even then.  Plates were slammed down, and so were the checks. Our server went from bad to worse after we talked to the manager. She took and brought back our cards without a word.   The food also wasn't great. The best thing was probably the spinach dip appetizer.  The quality of the burger one friend had was disappointing, the shrimp scampi tasted like it was soaked in lemon for days, and the Caesar salads seemed to be saturated in pepper.  Roasted chicken and mashed potatoes were okay but not something I'd go back for, especially given the poor service."}
{"text":"Woww Where do I start. Easy. Lane Michael We are here visiting, looking for good food. We found that and found awesome amazing service. I prefer short reviews, so enough just awesome.

{"text":"This plaza was lacking in good food but Charleston's is a great place to eat! I like their green beans with bacon and their chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the only place that I will go for a working lunch. They have Wi-Fi to use, they play good music that' is not too crazy and distracting, but not too boring. It is also not too soft, but not too loud. Overall, this place just has a very good vibe and feel for when I just want quiet, not a lot of stimulation or distractions, so I can eat while I do some work on my laptop ,(I usually sit in a booth in the bar area).  Plus, the food is absolutely amazing. The bread for the sandwiches, their fries are so good. The bar/waitwaitstaff is always so wonderful. I never have to wait to be seated with a menu and a drink, a refill, or for my lunch."}
{"text":"Had the ribs and chicken combo. Chicken was not dry at all, lightly seasoned. Ribs slid off the bones without need of a knife, deliciously sweet. Beans tasted like sweet barbecue. The waitress, Holly, was quick and attentive - Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with a party of 7. Roaches crawling on the table & seat. Manager called over. We were seated at a different table. Dry apology & no birthday wish from the staff. Will never visit an establishment that doesn't make me feel valued or appreciated. (Late review from 9/6/2016)"}
{"text":"Went to this site to meet a work friend for lunch on a Weds. Got there early (around 11:30) and it was a good thing, because the place filled up fast. Mostly with business people, but some 'snowbirds' too.  The food is good, I had the turkey burger and it was a little well done, but not bad. Their gumbo is really good...had a cup of that for my 'side.' Very friendly service from the hostess to our server. I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but Charleston's is an exception from time to time...and especially for a nice lunch meeting."}
{"text":"We highly recommend this restaurant. The hostess was sweet, and professional. The atmosphere was lovely, the service was great,  and the food was delicious . I had the salmon and my husband had the steak..it was as so good, I felt like licking the plate We  also thought the prices were reasonable. We highly recommend this restaurant and we will return."}
{"text":"This place is consistent... great service & food. Comfortably elegant atmosphere. The bar is wonderful. Really welcoming and they make drinks with fresh squeezed juices. Last night our very fun bartender (Brian) made us his original concoction of something that tasted like a liquid creamy version of a thin mint girl scout cookie. Very nice!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy Charleston's many years ago and I recently decided to try them again. Unfortunately, the quality has gone downhill and the prices have gone up. They are now charging $5 for the croissants. I thought that was their hook? That would be like red lobster charging for cheddar bay biscuits or Taco Bell charging for an upset stomach. You just expect it! That's why you go.   Anyhow, I definitely wanted to try the steak and was disappointed to learn they no longer have the marinated fillet or sirloin on the regular menu. The manager said we could call ahead and ask but it would be hit or miss, most likely miss. So I ordered the standard fillet and I think I've had more tender meat come out of a Jack Links package.  I give them a 2 only because they've continued to maintain the cozy atmosphere with the gas lamps and the dark wood, but with the higher prices and sub par menu, I do not expect to go again anytime soon. I expect Charleston's to go by the way of Steak and Ale very soon."}
{"text":"The ambiance inside Charlestons is great.....very much like the Keg. Upscale with great lighting.  The wait staff were like bees around a hive and the place was brimming with customers on a busy sat night. Good service overall.  We had the chicken  fried steak & the chibatta chicken sandwich, The chicken sandwich was very good and the fried steak was very large and ok. A bit overrated imo.  The prices seemed about $3 a plate over what they should be. Sandwich and standard shoe string fries 13.00? Chicken fried steak was 16.00 To me, the sandwich was a bit expensive....burgers are 12.00  2 entrees with soda and tip ....better part of 50.00"}
{"text":"Charleston's is a nice restaurant.  My mother likes to go there.  There is a nice variety of food and the atmosphere is a little upscale (dark wood).  Their croissants with honey are amazing.  Unfortunately, I get sick every time I go - so I had to stop going.  My mother still loves it.  I guess I'm just sensitive to something there."}
{"text":"Great place to have prime rib and ribs.  Portions perfect and the price was not bad based on location.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Their prime rib; lord have mercy! If I was going to the chair for my last meal before leaving this dimension, this would be it-- hands down ad infinitum."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service! I had the Chicken Parmesan.  The ONLY reason they didn't get 5 stars is that the air conditioning just couldn't keep up with the 110+ degree weather and t was rather warm in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner here on Saturday night arrived and seated at 5:30 for 8 people and the food came at 6:30ish, was way to long..... I ordered fish special for the night it was rainbow trout grill with mixed vegetables, everything was to salty. I don't think I'll go back there."}
{"text":"The best shrimp EVER! Perfect stake, excellent service, and OMG to die for apple cobbler.  We were told this was the \"diner\" type restaurant in the area. Good, because I just got off a plane, was starving and didn't feel like putting on makeup or a dress. So we went.  The inside reminded me a bit of a slightly darker version of Cheers. The seating area had overstuffed leather booths that made me want to sink in and stay for a while.  If I ate wheat, I'd be able to tell you if the honey glazed Croissant they brought out with the salad was as good as it smelled and felt. Light, fluffy, and just out of the oven. Nearly irresistible.  If you're looking for good food and great service, this is the place! I'm totally going back again tomorrow! It was that good."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the meal, and server Amber. I loved the baby back ribs they were tender and not overly tangy. Bread pudding for desert (was to die for).....I had the roasted herb chicken with potatoes. The chicken was very tender and the potatoes outstanding. Cocktails . Amber your awesome. We will definitely return with our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Came to Charleston's with a large party to celebrate a birthday.  I order the french dip which was very good.  I did not enjoy paying $20 for it but, it was good.  The problems were as follows:  1.  The server was not very friendly.  Very abrasive and off putting.  She didn't smile much and seemed very frazzled.  2. We had to diners order the filet mignon cooked medium.  Both of them were cooked well done.    3.  A lot of our order was missing and didn't come out with the others.  When we address this with another staff member we were told that the server was new and to \"bear with her\".  I'm sorry but if this is a new server, why is she being given a 12 top by herself?  It was pretty obvious to me (see #1) that she was NOT comfortable.  Besides, it's no excuse.  Just simply say \"We are sorry for the delay and will get things straightened out ASAP\"  Shouldn't throw the server under the bus.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Had lunch there. The food was OK, although rather expensive. Not a good price-value combination. But also, there was a dispute concerning a charge on my credit card, and the manager in charge at the time was very patronizing and condescending, in a passive aggressive way, while I tried to resolve it with him, so I had to work it out with my bank instead. I can tell his employees hate working for him, and it's reflected with a few of them in their manner with customers. So, If you can overlook that, and you don't mind overpaying a bit for the food you get, this place might suit you fine."}
{"text":"Delicious and love the atmosphere, been going there for 6 years and it is just awesome. They have a salad that comes with chopped egg, bacon and more, try that with the Thousand Island dressing, mmmmm. The 2 things I love to order most, Chicken Fried Steak and Prime Rib... They have Coca Cola and keep you full at all times!!! The best thing on the menu is actually a side item, The brandy mushrooms, wow!"}
{"text":"Overall visit was good but nothing outstanding. The hostesses seemed very confused and once we finally got seating in the bar area we sat down and it seemed to take awhile to even be acknowledged. I ordered the shrimp Scampi which would have been better if it had more flavor. I love garlic but it was very overpowering and so t was difficult to enjoy it. During this time the bartenders broke two glasses. One of them shattering above a man sitting at the bar. They were not apologetic and it felt like they were just embarrassed but not concerned with the man there. Our waiter seemed to be consistent and then he was just gone so we had to hail someone else to get the check. Over all it was just ok. I don't think I'll come back unless it's a get together for which I would have no choice of where we would go"}
{"text":"I went to Outback at this location a couple mo. ago. I wanted an item that they no longer had on the menu. They made it for me. :-) Not too long after I ate it someone came by and asked if it was good. \"It was excellent \", I told him. :-) Very good food and service. Have been meaning to give them a 5 star rating and good review. Here it is. This is a great place to eat and be served. :-)"}
{"text":"wow, who cold have thought a chain restaurant could service up such good food?  went here based on the Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.. Service was excellent, ribs, potato soup and key lime pie were all outstanding.  The only reason it is not a 5 is their  \"perfect Margarita\"  was anything but perfect... tasteless .. would not order again...    Prices were great too.. Definitely would eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"I've driven past Charleston's on the I-10 and Ray plenty of times and never gave it much thought, but a few weeks ago I was invited to a business lunch there and it is pretty much perfect for that. It's a nice professional atmosphere and I was actually impressed with my spinach salad, the quality was much better than I expected. I don't have a whole lot else to say except that the croissants that come with lunch are heavenly."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! The food is always amazing and the service is always great :) The chicken ciabatta is so good and I get it every single time I go with the french fries :) The spinach artichoke dip is also so good and it is a must :) we will always continue coming here :) (my dad says the ribs are incredible too)"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment here. Had a large party and my dinner got lost. They got it fixed in a hurry and comped dessert. Just good food at a reasonable price. This is why it is always packed. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Charleston's. They are quick once you get seated. They always refill your drinks really quick and the servers are great. Never had a problem at this location. I love the Mesa location!"}
{"text":"The best Baby Back Ribs I've had in a long time! Combine that with outstanding service by a gentleman named Jeff - friendly, accommodating and forthright. Very patient with my guest and we had a delightful evening. He made everything we requested appear immediately and in a gracious manner - superb waiter!  I could not have been more pleased with Jeff's service and our dinner."}
{"text":"The place is nice to hang out with friends. Sometimes I have observed that the servers are not responsive. But, today, Palina was really friendly and careful of our orders. Had a nice experience!"}
{"text":"One word! AWSOME! Great service from door to table- great food! Great wait staff, works together as a team keeping seamless customer service!! This is what HOSPITALITY looks like! Keep doing what you doing! Thanks for another great experience! Had fried Catfish Platter w/ fried okra! Yes crisp! Hubby had Rib & Chicken combo w/ fried okra and vegetable medley done but firm! Aaron was on top of things! Thanks Aaron from the Chandler AZ location!"}
{"text":"Charleston's is one of my favorite restaurants! My friends and I meet there frequently simply because we love the food and the service is always excellent. We equally enjoy the atmosphere. We usually sit in the bar area and appreciate the calm and quiet setting. It is pleasant whether we are sitting inside or out on the patio. We are able to visit with one another and enjoy the fabulous food from Charleston's. We love it there."}
{"text":"Prime rib celebration dinner with my husband, newly married and our best friend visiting from out of town.  You can count on Charleston's to provide, excellent service and consistent quality food preparation.   Though it may be a chain, I have not had a bad experience or meal here. The menu has a great variety.  The restaurant makes for cozy casual dining and conversation."}
{"text":"Delicious food we need for our unexpected overnighter in Chandler. My boyfriend ordered the 20oz prime rib with a potato and ate it all up! The banana pudding was to die for! Our server was so sweet and made sure we never reached the last sip of our water or iced tea without another one on its way. Definitely a good steak house, and would stop by again if we passed through Chandler again."}
{"text":"*****UPDATE::  I just got a call from the regular manager ...very apologetic...sent me vouchers to come back.  Thank you! That's how you treat your long time  customers...!!  I work in the building behind Charlestons in Scottsdale Been going there for 13 years.  Not just for personal dining, but for corporate dining.  Vendors from all over the US visit us and we not only dine there with them but recommend it to them. Spent thousands of dollars there. The food is great Service is quick Wait staff is attentive Wide variety of food Happy hour is fun Patio dining is a bonus in good weather  Took my family and out of town guests for dinner recently  Stunned at the small portion of ribs (which i eat frequently there) Although embarrassed, I did speak to the waitress who then had the manager come to the table. Jeffrey Jee. He blamed \"corporate\" for the smaller portion (of course there is no reduction in the PRICE for the smaller portion) I told him I'd been coming here for a decade and even the waitress told him we are regulars, and he said nothing he can do.  Yes, that's a great response, you have disappointed long time guests and you shrug your shoulders and basically say too bad.   Sorry. I don't take that attitude well. I'm in customer service. That is the shittiest customer service I've experienced in awhile  I'll be telling everyone They will no longer see any of my money, nor our business colleagues money, friend and family will also boycott this establishment. That's not how you treat your guests  Thanks for listening **********"}
{"text":"We have returned to this location and we are glad we did. Our 20th Anniversary came up and we were both out of town. We thought about where we might go to have a nice quiet meal. Charleston's came up without a second thought. We arrived and we're greeted by these elegant hostesses. The ambiance was so calming as we were seated. Logan was our Server and he made us feel right at home. Our meals arrived and we both felt like the chef made each one for us as if there was no one else in the restaurant. The flavors were bursting with each bite. This location is outstanding. We made the right choice."}
{"text":"Great Chili Soup Hard to find and pleasant Servers make it a pleasant dining experience"}
{"text":"Excellent food and table wait staff but that really didn't offset the 52 minute wait to be seated after being told the wait would be 20 minutes. I don't mind waiting except people that came in after us got seated with little or no wait...seems a staff person would just seat people he saw standing regardless of the wait list."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always expect the best. Just as the previous times I have been here. I always am surprised by this place every time. The food is great and always consistent.  The service is great and consistent as well, something that is a hard find these days. The food is served in generous portions that makes the price seem too good to be true. When you get your bill and see the total for the amount of food you received you feel as if your waitress forgot to ring in your whole order or gave you someone else bill. You just say nothing pay the bill and leave so you don't get caught, but wait, it's true it was yours so no sneaking out."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere, I would not take kids, let the adults have a nice night out!  The champagne chicken salad is amazing, the croissants are so heavenly, the steaks are delish!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Ahwatukee for 15 years and this is still my favorite restaurant! The food is superb (my favorite is the shrimp cargot and steak), and I love the ambiance. Servers are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"A comfortable, casual place to have a tasty meal with friends or family.  I took some dealers out at their request to this spot and everything looked good.  Someone had prime rib, I had soup (not too hungry that night), we had shrimp cargot (very rich but good), and spinach artichoke dip (also good) to start.  Also friendly staff and good prices.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place sucks...service is the worst ever! You have to beg to put in an order.....wow never ever have i had to beg for someone to take my money."}
{"text":"I've always have had consistent quality with service and food. The rolls are delicious. Not anything to critique; background music is up beat to help motivate patrons to get in and out! Atmosphere is more relaxed than the pace of lunch service. I need to come back for a dinner service and see what pace they have at that time! Anyway a good meal, little on the $$$ till you see the portions (soup and salad combo)."}
{"text":"The dinner we had at Charleston's was fantastic.  My husband had the pork chops with mash potatoes and baked chili beans.  Definitely generous portions and he now has leftovers for tonight's dinner.  I had the chicken picante with fried okra.  My meal was wonderful.  We will definitely be returning to Charleston's again soon.  The staff was very friendly and attended.  Beautiful, romantic restaurant."}
{"text":"Been coming here since last century. My favorite dishes are the ribs and for happy hour shrimp cargot.  These ribs are incredibly tender, you just need a fork (no knife) and they are available as a half rack for much less $.  Also amazing chicken fingers (not on menu) are available during happy hour.  Their salads come with a hot croissant drizzled with honey.  It's a meal in and of itself.  They have bison burgers now. Amazingly flavorful and juicy with a lower fat contenet than beef. Give it a try!  *** update*** they now offer coconut shrimp and it's only $6 during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for about 10 years now.   I must admit the only thing I get here are the baby back ribs (full rack - snort!)   Ribs are always consistent, above average and on par with most restaurants in the area.   Easily pulls apart and very good, anticipated, flavor and texture.     I've also spent a little time in the bar.   Drinks are generally healthy and moderately priced.   Decent pours on top-shelf libations.  In the North Scottsdale area, there are a LOT of choices for restaurants.   Charleston's offers  consistent, moderately priced fair in an ocean of much more upscale and more expensive eateries.   3 stars from me...which should be interpreted as good/recommended."}
{"text":"Always love going to Charleston's at Ray Road and I-10 in Chandler and taking friends there. Their spinach artichoke dip with salsa, sour cream and tortilla chips is the best of any restaurant I've ever been to! The Loaded Baked Potato soup is amazingly good! (No calories, right?!) The food is always top quality and the service there is always impeccable. When you have a half glass of iced tea remaining, your server immediately brings you a new full glass. The honey drizzled croissants that come with salads melt in your mouth. The atmosphere inside of Charleston's sports wall sconces and is very cozy. Whoever I go there with, we're never disappointed. It really makes for a pleasant dining experience--which is rare these days--when you don't need to constantly flag your server down to ask for beverage refills. If you've never been to Charleston's before, wait no more! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Superb dinner, pleasantly surprised. Prime rib thick cut and perfectly cooked med rare, baked potato loaded and on point. Service and atmosphere 5 stars all around. Would come back again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"came in for dinner one night and sat at the bar... super low lighting... both bartenders were very friendly and made good beer recommendations.... they were, in my opinion, pushing everything on the menu like it was the best thing on earth..... didnt mention the specials till i over heard a waitress talking about them... then he had to ask the other bartender what they were...  I ordered the terrayki top sirloin steak special with garlic mashed potatoes... Steak wasnt that good at all but it was cooked to a good medium like i asked. That doesnt earn them any more stars though... mashed potatoes were ok....   Best thing about this place was the beer and thats not even gonna get them an extra star because they sell those beers everywhere in AZ.....   wont be coming back here either!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. The dimly lit room, along with the dark oak decor, made the place seem comfortable yet exquisite. What stood out the most was the service. The general manager, Mike, was very accommodating. We are from out of town and he personally escorted us to our table and went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Our waiter, also named Mike, was very knowledgable when it came to the wine and the speciality dishes. He recommended the trout for my mother and the sirloin for me. We both highly recommend them, and suggest a red blend to accompany them. A baked potato came with my sirloin and it was delectable... Smothered in butter, soy cream, cheese, and bacon. Sooo delicious! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Prime rib was delightful. Prices were not out of whack, service was friendly.  Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Tried Charleston's for the first time on a Friday night. Called ahead to put our name on the list so we wouldn't have to wait long. We were seated immediately upon arrival which was nice considering it was 6:45pm on a Friday night. The restaurant was packed! Our server came and took our orders and was prompt with our drinks and appetizer.   We ordered Prime Top Sirloin for my husband which he swears tastes like its from Mastros or a place like that! It was cooked perfectly. I had the Prime Rib with a side of fried okra which was devoured quickly by my 4 year old son. My son ordered the catfish off the regular menu. Portions were plenty and tastes was top notch! Our drinks were refilled constantly and despite being busy, our server was very attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Apparently, this is a chain, although I had never heard of it and we don't have one where I live.  Came here for a work dinner as they were quickly able to accommodate a group of 11.  I was pleasantly surprised at the ambiance, menu, and service of Charlestons (kinda wish we had one).    We had one server who did a great job of serving our table and all of the demands.  My coworker and I each ordered a sandwich but decided to split/share halves.  French Dip and the Chicken Avacado.  Seriously, it is not hard to get a sandwich right I know but these were SO good.  Really hearty portions (came with fries) and I probably could have easily just had half a sandwich.  The full entree choices looked pretty good.  One of my coworkers had the angel hair pasta with asparagus but substituted the chicken for shrimp... she loved it.  They have something for everyone on the menu.  They also had a couple of local beers on tap which were delicious as well."}
{"text":"The food is great, the atmosphere is great. Five stars all the way. We had the new England clam chowder/baked potato soups, the hickory burger with fries, the cheeseburger with fried okra. Nicks Bread pudding for dessert so good."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch on occasion with clients. It's always been very consistent and the service is always solid. No complaints ever.  I recommend the chicken tenders, ribs and the chicken Caeser. Portions are pretty large and the food is always hot and timely.  I've seen mixed reviews here for dinner, but cannot comment because I only go here for business lunches. The food isn't anything I was amazed about, but it is above par, flavorful and an excellent choice for meeting with clients."}
{"text":"I've had so many underwhelming experiences here that it's getting painful.   My most recent adventure in Charleston's was for a business meeting. At first, it was nice because our server let us chat. And then I realized that they weren't being conscientious, they were just nonexistent. They finally came by with our appetizers and we were completely done with both sets of chips (spinach and cheese dip and the guacamole with salsa) before they ever came back to take our entree orders. I then ordered a glass of wine which I didn't get until our food was delivered. Let me tell you, that's a long time to be without a drink for a business meeting.   The catfish was just ok. I did really enjoy the Brussels sprout and mushroom sides quite a bit. My husband's prime rib with raw horseradish was pretty good. Two people at our table didn't get the proper sides with their meals, which they had to ask to get corrected.   Beforehand, we hung out at the bar and the bartender was great. So there's that."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group for work. Our first selection of wine was sold out.  It took our server 20 minutes to tell us.  So we chose something else.  Guess what?  They were out of that too.  So 40 minutes after being seated we finally get the wine figured out( Gallo or some crap from a box).  Appetizers were just eh...  So when the server came to take our order it was pretty uneventful.  I ordered the Ribeye special.  Guess what makes it special?  It's a NY Strip pretending to be a Ribeye.  And it was crap.  Apparently they ran out of Ribeyes.  Funny how the guy next to me got his Ribeye.  I took two bites realize it is cooked medium well (medium rare Ribeye was the order) and focused on my salad(it was really a salad and it was semi ok).  Since the service had deteriorated to dust and pebbles by this time, everyone was done by the time she realized there was a problem.  Thanks for offering something else after the meal is over.  I'm assuming the manager was the next guy who said he'd take it off the bill(seriously who really cares at this point and I'm expensing it for work).  If they were truly sorry for their crappy service and buffoonery then they wouldn't wait until the end to offer up something to make up for their inability to run a steakhouse.  An alleged steakhouse.  With no wine.  At a steakhouse.  Allegedly.  I stopped at McDonalds on the way back to my hotel.  It was way better than this outhouse steakhouse.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to try cookie cutter TGIF-esque eateries...the food borderline to over saturated two-bit American bar food - but Charlestons is different.  Ambiance is stylish and intimate enough for a first date, but folksy enough for a Friday night pau hana with friends...service is friendly but could be sloghtly more attentive.  Food itself was surprisingly delicious. Pork chops were MASSIVE and succulent, and seasoned oh so well. Garlic mash was good but standard, and side angel hair was well done, tossed with garlic and olive oil, but light enough to complement (and not compete) with the starch of the potatoes.  Overall very good."}
{"text":"The service is great!  The ribs are to die for!  The baked potato soup is wonderful!  Best veggies ever with the ribs!"}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable meal here!  Everything we ordered was delicious and I like the atmosphere.  Holy chicken fried steak...it was the biggest portion I've ever seen and delicious too.  Hopefully we can return when in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sheraton Desert Oasis for the first time, and was looking for a nice restaurant. The villa recommended Charleston's, and we took advantage of this recommendation. One daughter had the \"special\" pasta bolognese, which had an amazing flavor. My husband enjoyed the babyback ribs that were very tender. My other daughter had a Waldorf salad with a champagne vinaigrette - all very delicious; while I ordered a house salad with an herb vinaigrette and a cream chicken noodle soup. Soup was mediocre - it had clots of flour... It was my fault that I did not say anything nor send it back, but the overall superb service and food made up for it. Did I mention we had the spinach and artichoke dip? It was so good, we ordered 2 servings! Yes. Two. My family will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"While celebrating our anniversary on Valentine's Day we drove from Tolleson, Az at 3:40 pm to Mesa for our reservations at 5:00 pm, it was rainy and there were so many accidents we got stuck in traffic and were not able to make our reservation on time. At about 5:25pm the restaurant called me to see if I was still coming and I said yes, let them know I was almost there and just stuck in traffic to my surprise they said ok. Once we arrived at 5:35pm we went inside I was expecting to have to wait for a table since people were waiting for a table but the hostess took us right in and sat us at our table. After having such a rough drive and then the restaurant being so understanding it made for great Anniversary. The food was so delicious and our waitress so amazing and on point. I truly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had our 35th anniversary dinner there last year.  Liked it so much we came back for our 36th anniversary dinner this year.  Worked it out ahead of time with Nadia (GM) and our waitress Emily was awesome.  We each had a wonderful meal, I know that when we go to Charleston's that whatever is on the menu is going to well prepared and tasty.  I rarely order pork chops anywhere but Charleston's.  And we found that they have a very nice Gluten Free menu available as well."}
{"text":"The appetizers were so good, I ordered one for a meal with a side of  seasoned rice!  There is no possible way to improve on the shrimp cargot!"}
{"text":"Chicken Piccata and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken were both EXCELLENT...portions are very generous( you won't leave hungry)...service was very attentive...We have dined here for YEARS..it NEVER disappoints. It's obvious the proprietor genuinely CARES and pay close attention to detail.  Carol B"}
{"text":"Very happy with the food and service.  All orders came perfectly cooked and served in a comfortable environment.  It would be hard to find a better local restaurant than this one."}
{"text":"Super cozy restaurant!  Dimly lit with gas lamps in true Charleston form (I was a resident of Charleston, SC for a decade), with an open kitchen for gazing if you so desire.  I've been here twice and on both occasions the service was impeccable.  The last time I was here I just mentioned that it was my friend's birthday and at the end of our meal, he brought over a complimentary ice cream sundae for him.  Well done, Charlestons...well done! I've had the Waldorf Salad while here at lunch.  The croissant that came with the salad was AMAZING, but I expected a bit more from a $16 lunch salad.  On my second visit I tried one of their burgers and it was delicious.  Perfectly cooked to medium temperature, with a delicious homemade BBQ sauce, shaved cheddar cheese, and crispy bacon.  Their fries are also amazing.  Thinly cut shoestring fries cut to perfection.  Tip: eat the fries first...they're so thin that they get cold pretty quickly.  This would be a great place for a first date or for a happy hour drink and snacks.  The bar was beautiful and is located in the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place and I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants.  If you go here, I recommend anything wood fired or smoked. I had the short smoked salmon and it was the best salmon of my life!  It was that good!  Great relish and cucumber condiments to go with it.  I will come back here just for it!  One of the other guests ordered prime rib sandwich. I was secretly jealous I didn't order it.  Other people ordered salads.  They looked okay but nothing spectacular....you are better off with sandwich or meat entree.  The ambience is very nice and our server and the wait staff were terrific.  Thanks for a great lunch! :)"}
{"text":"My wife picked it and glad she did.  Quite good prices    We don't have these up where we're from. I'm sure we will look for this franchise as we travel.  Very  good"}
{"text":"These are great Resturant's. We went to a couple of these while in Az this year  The waiter was one the best we have ever had great suggestions... We will to back"}
{"text":"Good little place a friend and I ate at after a session at the shooting range. Basic food and drinks.   Burger is about average as were the fries. The price of this place compared to others, was more on the high end. We ordered the basic burger and fry with Bud Light. Made to order. Burger was more dry than I like, fries were unseasoned and the service wasn't the best. The place was not crowded at all, but still seemed to take longer than normal for the food to arrive.   Food - 7.0 Atmosphere - 6.5 Time - 6.5 Service - 7.0  Overall - 6.75"}
{"text":"My Husband and I like to have our special date nights here. The food was incredibly delicious as usual but we feel that this time in particular was escalated because of our server Ramone. Thank you Charlestons for employing and providing a great experience and fantastic quality of food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get what I think is the best Prime Rib in the valley. The service is always very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is lends itself perfectly to couples looking for a little romance. Everything is a bit pricey but worth every penny. When you order Prime Rib you get a salad and a choice of two sides. Plus their spinach dip is awesome!"}
{"text":"Try the Grilled Trout!  It's awesome.  Veggies are fresh.  The service is always good, not matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise.  This was a great experience from start to finish.  The hostess opened the door and greeted us as we walked towards the door and immediately sat us at a lovely table.  The wait staff work as a team and drinks were consistently filled, special food requests accommodated.  The manager came by and greeted us.  Our food was delicious and beautifully plated, and as we left we were thanked for coming and the door opened for us again.  Charlestons on south Country Club in Mesa, AZ, you deserve this 5 star rating.  One of the most pleasant dining experiences we've had in a while.  Excellent job."}
{"text":"We come here often but since Im new to Yelp, this is my first review. The catfish dish is amazing. The Chicken Club sandwich is amazing! The Waldorf Chicken salad (mouth-watering right about now) amazing. This place never ceases to amaze me with its delicious dishes. I love the atmosphere and the fact that you can go there and not have to deal with really loud music like everywhere else. Oh and my husband loves the prime rib and the Blackened Salmon Caesar Salad."}
{"text":"My parents have been raving about this place's bread pudding for a few years now, so they brought me here for a special occasion. It's an upscale chain, apparently owned by the same folks who own Krispy Kreme, but they seem to go out of their way to make it a classier Southern-themed dining experience--good atmosphere, no pictures on the menus, professionally dressed waitstaff, etc. We'll get to the bread pudding in a minute (spoiler alert: worth the hype), but let's start at the beginning...  The service was top-notch. My dad had to cancel our original reservation because everyone in the family got sick, and they were very kind about rescheduling it and cutting our number from 8 to 3. When we arrived, he asked if the girl he spoke to (Michelle) was there in order to thank her. She caught us on our way out and was very sweet to my father. Our server (Vince) was great! He was friendly, warm, and patient with me changing my mind 3 separate times in the same order.  When I asked about the fumé blanc wine, he brought out a sample for me to try. The busser who brought out our food was also incredibly sweet. The overall niceness of the employees makes me think that this corporation treats their staff well...I hope that's the case.  I enjoyed the food. The place, as a Southernish joint, isn't vegetarian-friendly, but it's doable if you eat fish. I ordered the catfish platter (grilled) with glazed carrots and fried okra. The fish tasted really fresh, which is always surprising to me in the middle of the desert, and the sides were awesome. Too much fried okra, but I'm not complaining. Mom got the fried catfish with coleslaw and fries, and she said the fish was great. Although I don't especially enjoy coleslaw, they make theirs with jalapeno, and it was actually pretty good--different. My dad got the filet mignon with fries. He said it was a little tough but seemed mostly happy.   While dinner was fine, the dessert was absolutely killer. Oversized desserts of the variety that you find at American chains are a secret pleasure of mine, and these delivered. The key lime pie \"slice,\" which was more like a quarter of a pie, was awesome, with a giant mound of fresh whipped cream to top it off. The lime component rode that sweet/tart line just like good key lime pie does, and the crust, while a little thick, was delicious. The bread pudding won the day, though. It was basically a slab of battered and raisin-studded croissant (yep) floating in a frothy cream sauce tinged with nutmeg and cinnamon, served warm. While we were too collectively full to finish both desserts, we did a pretty good number on them.  Overall, a nice experience. My parents are a little picky and they LOVE this place, so it's a good place for family celebrations and special gatherings. I even saw a few toddlers running around, so I'm guessing they have a kid's menu."}
{"text":"Charleston is a place we go when we want a more upscale dinner and we have never been disappointed.  This time we went with some of our favorites.  My wife had Parmesan Encrusted Chicken and I had Grilled Pork Chops.  We were both very happy and the service was also great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Have only been there one time and we sat outside, so I will not comment on the interior. I had the ribs and they were awesome, wife had chicken and was very happy, service was good and when the sun moved and hit us in the face the staff lowered the blinds and helped move our table over a bit to get out of the sun. Prices were what we expected for the type of restaurant, we will return when back in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Ordered online and had fairly quick delivery via postmates (took him less than 5 minutes to deliver it) and my burger was cold, cheese wasn't melted, and fries were super cold as well."}
{"text":"Only $1 off drinks during happy hour?  Boo!  Why did they change it?  They have a decent wine list and a nice looking bar and patio but I just can't stand places that don't have good drink specials during happy hour.  That is the whole point.  Duh!  Oh well, at least their tasty appetizers are half off."}
{"text":"Had the spinach artichoke dip appetizer, and the Chicken Piccata for dinner.  Both were very good, and the service was above average too.  Small ding for someone's Sprite in our party getting topped-off with water, but stuff happens."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years I went came in today with my wife and little girl we had a spinach artichoke dip 2 cups of soup and split the chicken tender plater for lunch with to sodas and a kids lemonade every one was nice but at one point I had three full glasses of soda and my wife the same not a big deal but then the food came the chicken was burnt and very dry I'm not a picky person and was in a hurry because of the Holliday so I just told my wife not to send it back so we started to eat and I found a long black hair in my fries ( my wife and I are both blond so is are daughter) so I told my wife don't eat any of them so she was enjoying her half of the chicken on her own plate they had split the food in the kitchen and as she was having her last chicken strip guess what was in there a long BLACK hair I could not say how the Manager would have responded but I did not want a free dessert or any kind of gift card because I do not enjoy hairy food I will NOT be back to this restaurant if you do eat here I recommend to bring a flash light so you can see if there is any thing unwanted in your food I guess they keep it so dark so you can not see it till you eat it"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place.  Now I am very disappointed, for one there is no vegetarian item on the menu that are not a side dish.  Also when ordering things and making them vegetarian they seemed really bothered by it.  Lastly they broke my husbands debit card and didn't say anything about it, how sad is that.  I was really disappointed by the whole meal, from start to finish.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this one twice and have been impressed both times.  The service is professional, the food always looks and tastes great, and the ambience is mature, dark, and potentially romantic.  Think of it like a cheaper version of Houston's.  That said, its not entirely cheap - a couple will not walk out of there under $50 for a modest dinner.  As far as specifics, I've had the chicken/ribs combo which is a ton of food; the shrimp cargot which is a garlic-butter-cheese lovers dream; and the chicken tenders dinner which has delicious breading.  Honestly though, the best thing I've ever had at Charleston's was the French Bread Pudding - to die for! Charleston's is a great go-to place when you just wanna go out for a nice, decent dinner, but don't have a desire for any particular cuisine.  It's great for visting family/friends."}
{"text":"Gotta tell ya!!  This place really understands the meaning of OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!  We ordered the catfish blackened, and thought that lightly fried following would be a nice finish, right?  Well, the description listed on the menu wasn't quite accurate, as our fish arrived (piping hot!) though really heavily breaded.  Now it was good, but we felt, not as ordered.  We're not complainers, or restaurant snobs, so we just mentioned it to our server.  The manager (Mr. Burton) stopped by the table and inquired.  We told him that the fish was fine,but the menu was a bit off with the description.   He offered a fresh plate, a drink, really anything to make it right!  No worries!!  It's fine and fresh, so we'll keep it.  Well Mr. Burton came back,  (in minutes) with a fresh, full plate of blackened catfish, hot fries and coleslaw!!!  He apologized and mentioned that the menu description was in accurate and wanted to make sure we were happy!  Well, the way this manager stepped up, bought this location a regular-repeat customer!!  Nice job Mr. Burton!!! You are an asset to this restaurant!  And the food is excellent!!  (Try the shrimp cargot!!!)"}
{"text":"A nice place with some good food.  We went to Charleston's because we were given a gift certificate. The restaurant is nice, dimly lit ambiance and a warm date-night feel. The entree I chose was the prime rib. My wife chose the New York strip steak special. We each had a loaded baked potato side. I added a cup of gumbo soup .   Each of the selections were decent, but nothing stood out as surprisingly tasty. The prime rib was warm but not hot. It was good and the a ju was yummy , though needed. The baked potato was good but starkly dry.  The best food item was the desert, where we ordered the key lime pie and shared it. It was excellent!  The staff was delightful and positive. They were very attentive and nothing was ever lacking or mistimed. The waitress was jovial to my wife, which was great as she liked that.  Overall, the prime rib was a disappointment to me, so I might return to try the steak next time. That said, the prices were quite high for the experience, in my opinion. I'd return again, but won't get the prime rib again."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place it gets worse and worse. I remember going there a few years back and really liking the menu but these days they have changed a few things and the several items I have tried have all been mediocre at best. I will not be going back to Charleston's or recommending this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Casey was very attentive and always kept our glasses full. Chicken fried steak was best my husband has ever had. Chicken tenders amazing. Glazed carrots were great too..."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a birthday weekend. Wasn't too busy but they had a 75% capacity. Andi, the server was spectacular...she was patient, funny, kind, and had an amazing personality....even if the food hadn't been fantastic, she would have made the meal Awesome...btw the prime rib.... scrumptious...  I'll definitely go back and ask for Andi !!!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak hoping it would be good.  When it can to me I was a little leery how it looked but gave it a shot.  The first four bites were all breading!  I finally got to taste the meat and it was just as bad as the breading.  The worst chicken fried steak I've ever ate and it was 17.99 highway robbery.  This place is over priced and food doesn't live up to its price.  The only good thing is the manager on duty didn't make me pay for my chicken fried steak. My wife and my daughter didn't like it either.  I give this place a thumbs down."}
{"text":"There were five of us on this visit to Charlestons Restaurant in Chandler.  The service was perfect and so was the food.  We all ordered different items off the menu and everyone of the food items were cooked to perfection and delicious.  Nope .. it does not get any better."}
{"text":"I don't know what all these crazy people are talking about with their 1-star reviews. Wife ordered the spinach dip, crusted Parmesan chicken, and baked potato soup. I had the house salad and filet mignon with burgundy mushrooms. All of it was excellent, and the service was top-notch. More importantly, great value. Wasn't overpriced. To boot, the house salad came with a croissant that was soft, warm, and delicious. Ok, that sounded weird, but that was easily the best croissant in the history of FRANCE. But seriously. Croissant."}
{"text":"First time for everything! The experience here was amazing, my server was on top of everything! I came all the way from Florida to visit my sister and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Here is your typical steakhouse. I sat at the bar, ordered a salad and a steak with the house Cabernet. The steak was cooked right, and veggies were crispy.   One notable thing were their croissants. Served with my healthy salad was this piping hot croissant with honey on it! The server let me know they sell them frozen by the dozen.   Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Charleston's!!!Always impeccable service and they have the best salmon on the planet"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very cozy.  It is all dark wood and dark interiors.  The wait staff is all dressed in black.  The lighting is minimal with spot lighting for each table and what appear to be gas lamps on the walls.  The food is served in a minimalistic style.  You order a dish and a side.  You pay for each part of your meal individually instead of as a combination.  The vegetables were very fresh and cooked simply.  I would definitely eat here again.  The only downside is that it seems a little bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Made a reservation but when I got there they didn't have the reservation so a bit concerned about that but thankfully they didn't have a problem accommodating our party of 7.  We were seated at a large round table which was great because it facilitated large groups connection and conversation.  The table itself was lopsided though, which was weird and a little awkward but not the end of the world by any stretch.  Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.  Our server was great!  The food was very good - from the appetizers to our meals to the dessert that a few folks at the table shared.  There were rave reviews about the coconut shrimp and the brownie with ice cream, which isn't on the menu but apparently an option."}
{"text":"Excellent food and five star service. Best ribs ever. Everything is fresh and portions are large. Warm croissants with house salad are a special touch. I have had mushrooms, fried okra, garlic mashed potatoes and baked beans... All superb. Atmosphere is warm with wood and brick walls, low lighting with table sconces. Your glass with never be empty. Well staffed means excellent customer service."}
{"text":"First the bad: Atmosphere was dark and intimate, however the loud pop music playing in the back round was a bit strange for such a dark and elegant restaurant. We felt like the music belonged in an Applebee's.   The water that was served tastes like it came out of 50 foot garden hose. I would expect at least filtered water in such an upscale place. We had to order a bottle water.   The Good: Menu had a great selection, we chose a $13 salad and a $20 chicken n ribs platter. Then we ordered the clam chowder for an appetizer. Soup was AMAZING! More meat than potatoes. The salad and the dinner entree was a nice size and tasty. We asked ahead for a half order but they would not accommodate :-/  Service was excellent from the moment the doors were opened for us until we left. Waiter was very accommodating and nice.   Overall nice place..."}

{"text":"Tried Charleston's for lunch recently.  It was later and not too busy.  As mentioned by other reviewers, this place definitely attracts a Senior Crowd - wheelchairs, walkers, etc are right at home here.   We ordered a hamburger w/ fries and a prime rib french dip w/ baked beans.  French dip was good but not stellar and at $17 I expected to be knocked off my seat, beans were nothing to rave about either.  They have only one menu for lunch & dinner, our total for the above w/ 1 soda came to $31, pricey in my opinion.  Our waitress did a decent job until the end of our meal when she apparently left on vacation.  We waited for atleast 10 minutes before finally grabbing someone else to request our bill.  Our waitress finally returned with no apologies and a pitch for dessert - no thanks.    I won't be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! The waitress was funny and loveable. I would definitely come back for more prime rib and ceviche."}
{"text":"Food for everyone in the party was decent.  Nothing special, but not terrible either.  The ambient noise level was awful.  Even with the restaurant half full we could barely hear one another across the table.  As the dinner crowd began to fill the place it got even worse.  We finally gave up and left.  DON'T GO HERE IF YOU EXPECT SOME CONVERSATION WITH DINNER.  Oh, and my Corona beer was completely \"skunked\"."}
{"text":"Yes starters/appetizers (all 5 of them) are half off on happy hour. But the regular prices are double what they should be. All around pricey. Just a handful of draft beers. Not sure how this place makes it..."}
{"text":"If I could have given this place 6 stars I would have. Amazing service, amazing fresh food for a good price. This place is definetely in my top 5 favorite restaurants. I have yet to taste anything that wasnt amazing. Even the cocktails are mixed perfectly! Wait staff is on point, refills are there before you can even think of wanting one. Cant say enough about this spot!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience! Our server was Jeff and he was super attentive and on top of things. The ambiance is very dark so could be a nice spot if you had a long day and want to be in a relaxing environment. Menu is upscale however prices are reasonable.   I started with a soup of the day because I was so hungry, very good. My colleague went for the prime rib which looked amazing. I had the parmesan crusted chicken which was huge! Great atmosphere, huge portions, and good value and service. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"They guarantee have the best croissant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time today. Our server was nice although I forget her name. As far as the food goes, I had the crispy fried chicken sandwich with a side of fries. Wanted to keep it simple. The chicken sandwich has coleslaw in it and it added a good flavor to the sandwich. The croissants we ordered were kind of dry (If you want good croissants, definitely go to Cheddar's in Chandler). My coworker got the Parmesan crusted chicken. It looked really good so if I go back, I'll definitely order that."}
{"text":"The food here is very good but the snotty hostesses are rude I waited 10 minutes to give our name because they wee busy talking to guys. Never coming to this location again"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is outstanding.  Reasonable but really good.  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and it was delicious. For $12 dollars it's a lot of food.  Came with a small salad, pasta and two 6 ounce chicken breasts.  I would certainly order this again.  If you like baked potatoes this is also the place for you. They know how to make them here.  I like crunchy shells on the outside of my baked potato and that's just how they make them. It's not a fancy place but has a cute bar area and food has consistently been good every time I go there.  Con: seating available outside but it overlooks the parking lot."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family and the food was amazing. I had the New York strip and I was when it came down to eating the last bite. I will definitely come back here when I come back to this area."}
{"text":"Took my wife, daughter and mother here for a special dinner.  We arrived at 7 pm and were warmly greeted and led to a booth.  Hated the booth, way too small.  We asked for a table and our hostess was very friendly and said, \"No problem\" which was much roomier.  Our water was served quickly and our waitress took our drink orders and got them to us without delay.    I think the menu is limited, but the choices were traditional American and hearty.  I ordered the prime rib, which was good, but not something I would order again.  My wife and mother ordered shrimp scampi.  It was superb.  The citrus flavor pronounced, but not overly so.  My daughter ordered baked chicken on the bone.  It was the best chicken I have ever eaten.  The crispy skin, moist meat and flavor was excellent.  The sides were fresh and a perfect compliment.    Our server could not have been any better. My mother can be demanding and our server smiled and seem to care that it was a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere is dark and classy, very much a traditional American experience.  If this is what you are looking for I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Last night we were driving around after running an errand and couldn't decide on a spot for dinner when we remembered Charleston's. We were seated right away at a nice large booth in the back, my favorite spot to sit there. I looked at the menu and wondered why I was bothering when I knew I wanted the chicken salad sandwich, until my eyes kept going up and down and never saw it! When our waitress came to take our drink orders I asked and she said that yes they did remove it from the menu. No!!! It was one of my favorite things their besides the amazing potato soup. Ah, fine. Looks like it is time for something new.  I ended up going with the chicken parm and salad. It sounded different than your regular Italian marinara flooded melted cheese monster and I was intrigued. My boyfriend did get a cup of the baked potato soup and we shared it before our meals. Seriously I know baked potato soup became a popular item for places to serve but only Charleston's knows how to do it right. It is just perfect.  It was nice to see my plate come out with a nice helping of mixed greens along with two large chicken breasts and a small pile of angel hair pasta. A \"healthy\" balance if you would like to call it that. The salad was great with tiny mozzarella bits and tomatoes with some type of balsamic house dressing. I finished it all before starting on the chicken. After the first bite I was almost happy they took my sandwich off the menu or else I may have never given this dish a chance. The crust was some type of chopped walnut or another and it was light and crispy, not deep fried breading. The meat was cooked A+ and all around delicious. I barely got into the pasta because it was an afterthought. One piece of chicken would have been enough, but for the price I was pleased they give you two and I took the second home along with the pasta that I will enjoy later today I'm sure.  Somehow we were feeling decadent and ordered the apple walnut cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was giant and scrumptious but I was only able to handle a few bites, thankfully my boyfriend was in love with it so it didn't go to waste.  Our waitress was just as amazing as the meal was. I am happy this place is still giving great service as we continue to be satisfied patrons."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  We had the ribs and prime rib.  Portions are generous.  The prime rib was a tad on the salty side.  We really liked our server.  He placed our food order ahead of a large party, which allowed us to get our food relatively quickly.  Service as a whole was really good.  We felt like the restaurant staffs appropriately to ensure  that servers are able to attend to their tables."}
{"text":"Very solid restaurant experience.  Dim lighting makes in intimate.  Food menu has excellent choices.  I have had the chicken and rib combo.  The chicken is oven roasted and has great flavors.  Ribs were meat fall off the bone, the BBQ was a little sweet for my liking but still very good.  I have also tried their shrimp scampi and it as well tastes great.  They don't skimp on the shrimp, great flavors with big shrimp.  I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try if you are looking for well done American food and an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"This came highly recommended by locals, as well as friends who recently attended a conference at The Fairmont Resort near Charleston's.  I had the country fried steak and it was more quantity than quality.  I, for one, am worn out with seemingly every restaurant using \"chipotle\" in their dishes and this was the case with Charleston's country fried steak gravy, which has a little kick.  I had a cup of potato soup and it was excellent.  Friends with me had a cheeseburger and meat loaf.  My one friend raved about how delicious the meatloaf was and the other said his hamburger was perfectly cooked (hot pink in the middle).  I liked the dark wood atmosphere of the restaurant and it had customers ranging from families with kids to senior citizens, so it is clearly appealing to a mix of people.  Service was okay, though not memorable."}
{"text":"Date night and we decided to try a new restaurant. I was immediately pleased when we stepped they the door and the ambiance was exactly what I needed. I ordered the Parmesan Chicken and my husband ordered the Filet with mashed potato. My fish was excellent. Everything was just right. We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This location won't serve prime rib until 4:00. Very disappointing. Charlestons was one of my favorite restaurants, but if they won't serve what I want, I need to find another restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Charlestons in about 6 weeks and now am 100% convinced that there's no other sit down lunch restaurant better than here.  Food has been excellent and service equally as good.  Highly recommend the Prime Rib sandwich and fried okra and their blue cheese dressing is best around."}
{"text":"Count on Charleston's for top-notch food, service, and ambience.  I have visited this location at least a half dozen times, so I can attest to their consistency. My favorite dish is the Honey Lime Chicken Salad, which is light and tasty. It comes with a somewhat sticky (from a baked-on glaze) but amazing croissant. I'd prefer if they'd offer a half portion since it's a huge meal, and it doesn't survive to the next day.  Other menu items that my friends rave about are the pork chops, garlic mashed potatos, soups (especially the potato), burgers and chicken strips.   Going to Charleston's reminds me of visiting an old Chicago steakhouse. It has a dark, rich decor with lots of wood and leather. Even though the room seems dark, the table is well lit, giving customers a sense of intimacy.  The service is outstanding. The staff all work together, gliding quietly past tables clearing dishes and filling drinks. They are non-intrusive but anytime I look like I want my server, someone quickly appears to help me. There's definitely no \"where's my waitress?\" syndrome here."}
{"text":"Went there last night as we haven't been there in a couple years and I can see why. I had there grilled trout which wasn't to bad but the waitress failed to tell me just what it came with,a side of white rice and some kind of garnish that was placed on the top of the fish.When the food came the waitress didn't bring it and I asked where she was and was told that she was in the bathroom well I let the person know I didn't like the garnish and that the rice was the worst I have ever had the fish was the only thing that was good the rest did not compliment the main course. There are many other restaurants in Scottsdale where one can get a much better meal and service. I know now why we stayed away for so long and believe me we will be staying away again for a long time. This place is very over rated."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Everything here is perfection. The food, service, ambience.. Had Jaime as my server tonight.  She has a great balance of professionalism and friendliness. The manager, Jeff, brought me my steak and had me cut into it to make sure it was cooked the way I like. Excellent touch. You can eat here casually or great for a date. One minor thing... Bring back the mints please."}
{"text":"Charleston's, in my opinion, is an overpriced Applebee's.  I took a friend here because she wanted to go here.  After looking at the menu and prices, had I been alone, I would have left.  She evidently had her mind set on the chicken piccata for $16 (for lunch), so we stayed.    I got the chicken club salad that came with chicken.  I had no idea the chicken would be fried, so imagine my surprise when it arrived with fried pieces of chicken on top.  They graciously took it back and soon returned with a salad with grilled chicken on it.  The food was good as was the service.  My issue is with the prices.  I don't mind spending $35 on a meal for two, but not at a chain that is in the Applebee's category.  Too pricey, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a party of 10. Waiter was nice overall, but he had challenges getting our requests correctly. The drinks took a few times to get right and the wait for food was a bit longer than expected, for less than half occupied dining room. I ordered Catfish with fries and baked beans (the almost gone picture posted-lol) The catfish was not seasoned, which was disappointing so the tarter sauce (great dill flavor) & hot sauce was clutch. The shoestring fries were plenty and good-but the highlight of the plate was the baked beans....OMG!!! Perfectly seasoned and bbq flavored, but the MVP was the smoked meat mixed in, which added a surprise flavor and texture profile that elevated them, awesome recipe. If you don't try anything else, get the baked beans. Overall, a decent experience-I will return someday but after I try other options first."}
{"text":"Love, Love LOVE this place!  We come to AZ from San Diego each year for Spring Training and always look forward to our meal(s) there.  We have had exceptional food - you MUST start off the their Shrimp-cargot...amazing appetizer!  We have had salads, soups, sandwiches and entrees and always been very pleased with everything.  The Chicken piccata and prime rib dip are favorites for sure.  We have also had wonderful service and this week had a young lady named Bryce.  She was extremely pleasant and helped make our dinner even more enjoyable! Cant wait to go back next season!"}
{"text":"Im writing this review for my parents that are snowbirding in Mesa.  They don't do reviews but after talking to her I'm a bit angry.  They went for my fathers birthday tonight.  My father and my uncle ordered the special(ribeye).  My mother had the salmon and aunt had the mahi-mahi.  So when the meals came out the 2 steaks were different one a ribeye and the other a sirloin.  They told the server and she took it back to rectify it.  Half way through the rest of their meals his new steak came out.  Again it was a sirloin.  He didn't want to make a stink and at least eat with the rest of them so he dealt with it.  He said the steak was even a very tough sirloin.  That's where they lucked out it was my parents and not me.  I would of sat there until I had what I ordered in front of me.  I was told that the rest of the meals were very good.  But lost 2 stars for trying to pawn off a sirloin to a couple of ranchers that know the difference.  At least at this point they will not be back.  Unless i hear from management on their thoughts on what happened tonight.  Since you cant leave management any sort of email i figured everyone should know pay for what you order."}
{"text":"Great food and service. But a little pricey.  Food taste and quality however are wonderful."}
{"text":"Aagh!  I'm not supposed to like Charleston's!  So unhip.  So AARP.  Yet I keep coming back.  For a rare lunch date.  For dinner with my incredibly picky family who each can find something they like on the menu.  For Happy Hour and a decent wine list at crazy low prices.  For those days I just want a light dinner.  For the good service with no sign of the usual NoScottsdale attitude.  But it's a chaaaaiiiinn!  And tonight it looked like the adjunct dining room for the local Senior Center. - I kid you not, 80% Seniors.  And it's yet another Houston's clone, and I'm even a bit tired of Houston's (ok, Hillside or whatever the heck they're calling it nowadays).  I give.  I really do like Charleston's!  (Insert Sam-I-Am reference here)  Is this what my parents felt when they admitted they liked Country Kitchen?"}
{"text":"We've been here several times, and the food, and service has been great each time.  The waiter has offered suggestions about how to tweak a menu item/better pairing of sides.  Get the chicken fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Four stars is generous. I was going to say three but the service was very good so Jen said to go four. :)  Only been here once before and it was awesome. Today Jen and I both ordered the 10oz prime rib rare with salad. She had mixed veggies and I had garlic mash and a skewer of grilled shrimp.We ordered the Shrimp Cargot for a starter. It was amazing. Plump shrimp drowning in cheese and garlic butter with two sides of toasted French rolls.   The prime rib and mashed potatoes were both way over-seasoned. Which is too bad cause the prime rib was sooo tender. Unfortunately it was drown in Rosemary that not even the au jus could wash off. The garlic mash was riddled with black pepper so I could only eat a few bites. I kept envisioning Gordon Ramsey standing in front of the cooks shaking his head saying \"That's too bad,\" with a disappointed look on his face. Not so disappointing that I didn't eat all of the prime.   Ending on an up note, Jen had Blackstone Merlot which went very well with our meal and the salads came with a very delicious croissant. So delightfully sweet and fresh. Amazing and such a nice surprise. Veggies were veggies.   I reiterate the service was very good and the food was prepared to perfection other than the seasoning so I am chalking it up to bad luck. We will persevere and will be eager to return."}
{"text":"A customer of mine picked this place for lunch .. he swears the croissants are buttery delicious, so we decided to give it a try.   Celeste was our waitress today, she was great, she kept the refills coming and cleared things from the table each time she walked by.   I had the lunch special.. prime rib sandwich on a soft toasted French roll (thick slice of prime rib, so tender and flavorful), I used the aujus to dip my fries in .. yum!  The fried chicken salad can be ordered with grilled chicken.. the grilled version is juicy and they must cook it over wood, it was very good.   Soup of the day was clam chowder and baked potato soup loaded with cheese, bacon, & chives   And the buttery croissants were buttery goodness! I would come here for croissants and coffee if it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"The food was so good I went with my husband and friends for my birthday I really enjoyed it. I had catfish the and coleslaw the French fries were salty so I didn't eat much of those the drinks were great."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurant. It has an intimate atmosphere and the food is great"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. My prime rib is always perfect here! The spinach dip is always fresh and the best one I have had anywhere. The salad with creamy garlic dressing and a croissant pushes it over the edge! This is one of my favorite places for a special occasion, I have tried the ribs and they are good but not amazing like the prime rib! The service is always excellent, never had bad service here! I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"best prime rib going! Hands down. excellent service and food is just great!"}
{"text":"Very Good Food!  Really nice ambiance.  Servings are large.  Staff was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian I did not think Charleston's would have much for me. It turns out that I was right, HOWEVER, what they did have for me was actually very simple but amazing!  I had a business meeting today with a vendor and my biz partner. We all shared the spinach artichoke dip, which was super tasty and a great portion size. The chips were nice, warm and fresh and the dip came with salsa and sour cream on the side.  I had a house salad sans the bacon plus avocado for my entree and a baked potato on the side. I opted for the creamy garlic dressing and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The salad was fresh with egg, carrots and chopped tomato and the avocado made a nice addition.  They cover their potatoes in sea salt.. its pure genius. I'm serious. Genius. All I needed was a little butter and sour cream and I was set.  Our waitress was very attentive but not super friendly. She had a new iced tea out to me before I was halfway done with the one I was currently drinking. Great service but I have had to make five trips to the bathroom since.  This is a pretty good place for a business lunch but I wouldn't come here outside of that because I normally like something a little heavier for dinner and its a tad on the pricey side, but hey, I didn't pay so what do I care?"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise while visiting Scottsdale for a long weekend. Our family of five was looking for something close to our condo; \"nice\" without being over the top. Charleston's fit the bill perfectly.  Inside, the atmosphere is dark, cozy, but causal, lit by a number of gas lanterns. We were seated quickly on a Friday night at 7:30pm, with the restaurant about 70% full. Kids drinks came quickly, not so for our bottle of wine. I asked for the \"Elouan Pinot\" and the waiter brought out rosé. They had an Elouan Rosé of Pinot on the menu; so maybe an understandable mistake, maybe not..but then it took another 10-15 minutes before we finally got the right bottle, our first pour, and our order was taken.  Things improved from here. Food came out quickly and hot after the order; I'm a stickler for hot food/plates! We ordered 2 prime ribs, a sirloin steak, chicken piccata and a burger. Prime ribs, steak and burger were juicy, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Fries, loaded baked potato and veggies (garlic broccoli something) were excellent. My wife liked the piccata as well. Portions were on the generous side and the key lime pie was to die for. My wife makes this with limes from our tree all the time, and Charleston's was the closest to homemade we've ever had!  With the exception of the start, service was decent, and the experience overall a great value for Scottsdale. It's a perfect place for families, groups or couples looking to have an intimate, cozy dinner without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"My regular place!  I come here 1-3 times per week. I usually sit in the bar. I know them-- they know me--  all is good. Food is great, menu is large enough for a good selection-- you cannot run out of a beverage-- they have a keep em coming philosophy ( non -alcoholic that is!)  Everyone I bring gives it a thumbs up.  Great service-- very quick- perfect for lunch when you are on the go and dinner when you are not!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars! It's food is great, and our server, Ramon, was just one of the sweetest guys on earth, needless to say he was quick. I hope charlestons stays open, and hopefully Ramon gets a raise! :)"}
{"text":"Always good and it has a very nice atmosphere, especially for the price. The steaks are good and you can't wrong with anything that comes with one of their croissants. Great service as well."}
{"text":"I went back to this place and I have to update my rating.  I had the same exact meal and it was really great..even better than the 1st time.  The customer service is top-notch as well."}
{"text":"Charleston's is really close to my house and been wanting to try this place. Very curious. Very none assuming place. We walked in tonight and there was a 25 minute wait. Argh. Small waiting area and noticed that there were a lot of elderly people. Noticed that there is a bar area and a dining area. Very dark and lots of bricks. My daughter described this place as a wine cellar. Hahaha sounds just about right.   So I ordered the Catfish platter and it came with two large pieces of breaded fish, cole slaw, and shoe string french fries. The catfish was cooked perfect. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Loved the fish. Really liked the cole slaw. Enjoyed it and wished they gave me more but it was very good. Fries were normal. Nice, fresh, and crispy. So overall a very good meal.   My wife had the Spinach and Chicken Waldorf salad and switched out the cheese for grapes. I can't remember what was inside of the salad. I think it had strawberries, raisins, and apples with spicy pecans with a vignette dressing. The salad had a nice little kick to it. I grabbed a few bites and it was really good. My wife enjoyed it  My kids split a whole rack of baby back ribs. I got one of the ribs and it was falling off the bone. Very good ribs. Had a tiny kick to it but really good. The ribs came with two sides and they got mashed potatoes and shoe string potatoes. They ordered it with beans so the kitchen made a mistake. The waitress gladly gave them their beans. They said the mash wasn't very good but they liked the fries and beans. They were dipping the fries in the beans. So they really enjoyed their baby back ribs.   For dessert, we shared a key lime pie with fresh whip cream. So good. Loved the crust.   I would have to say the service was extremely good. We got our water cups really quickly and took our order. The food came out pretty quickly and our server kept on filling our water cups. She was very friendly and seemed to always have a smile which is always good.   So we had a very enjoyable dinner here. Good food. Good service in a wine cellar ambience. So we'll probably be back. JD and Joyce W was there at the same time but we missed you. Next time. Enjoy and happy dining."}
{"text":"Great food outstanding service prime rib to die for if you want some good food eat at Charlstons"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the recommendation of a friend who was craving the catfish platter. We both opted for the lunch special, a catfish sandwich plus a side. We chose the coleslaw to compliment the sandwich. Both the sandwich and the slaw were wonderful. I also ordered a cup of clam chowder. It was nothing special. In fact kind of bland to me. The service was great. My lunch was great. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"PROS: ambiance was nice, our server was amazing and looked like Jude Law ;)  CONS: food was mediocre at best, limited menu selection. Generally, when a restaurant has a small menu you'd expect it to be amazing. We got a cheeseburger and the chicken tenders. Tenders were okay, but the burger was horrendous. Tasted like those frozen patties you get at the store.   Even though the experience was nice, I go to restaurants primarily for the food, so we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! we come here for date night they offer the best food and service! They consistently impress us every time we dine here."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Kids had Mac and cheese said it was so good. We had filet, roast beef sandwich dip and salmon Cesar salad. Dessert we tried carrot cake, bred pudding and brownie. All was 2 thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Charleston's is one of my favorite restaurants in Mesa.  You cannot go wrong with anything you order.  The inside decor is top-notch.  Dark, romantic, plenty of space between booths, and almost every table area is a booth.  I saw plenty of people eating chicken marsala and ribs and key lime pie, but I love their soups, salads, chicken, and seafood.  Their house citrus vinaigrette is yummy, and their tomato soup has vegetables in it for a wonderful flavor.  The key lime pie has nuts in it also.  The entrees are mostly $10-20 and there is an immediate seating sign outside, so check that out even if the parking lot is crowded."}
{"text":"We were told twenty minutes for wait time, it was forty. The restaurant is dimly lit for mood lighting, and was very loud. Food was good but not the best, it is priced at what it is worth so a good place for a more inexpensive steak dinner for two. Bread is only served before the meal if you request it. Meal took a very long time, we waited close to an hour for our entree to be served so I am glad we finally asked for bread during the wait."}
{"text":"What can I say about Charlestons other than they have the off the chain pork chop dinner with veggies that is seasoned to the hilt, just perfect.  The baked potato soup is like no other that I have had..this is our Friday date night go to"}
{"text":"Outstanding on many levels.  Walking in, this restaurant will feel VERY familiar.  From the bar to the waiting area to the dining room, it might be your first time but you'll swear you've been here before.    We had a group of 14 and two young ladies did an outstanding job on every level with our group.  Nobody wanted for anything the entire time.  The dinners are simple cafe type fare, but are well prepared and presented.  I ordered the oven roasted half chicken with mashed and baked beans.  Everything was outstanding and the white meat on my chicken was moist and tasty.  Drinks are on the lighter side, but other than that you shouldn't have any problems with this restaurant.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"We eat here often and it's always great food. Always great service. I would recommend eating at Charleston's to anyone looking for a great dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone down hill and still going. Had bad service 3 months ago, but decided to try again. It was a big mistake! Horrible service!! The worst I've had in years. I could list the numerous things that put me off from the last visit, but it's just not worth my time. But just for fun?  I'll list a few.   Waiter getting our order wrong 4 times in one visit. Forgetting to ever get drinks after drink order was taken. Reminded twice.  Waiter sitting on kitchen counter. GROSS! Couldn't recognize his own hand writing and came back to retake the order. And still got it wrong.   When complaint was voiced to the manager on duty. About the waiter, wrong sides, and chicken being very over done. The only thing I was offered was a free dessert. No sir. I will not have dessert. I wanted out of that restaurant as quickly as possible.  And you can't pay me to ever go back!! Stay clear."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a Wednesday night, not thinking I would really need it.  They asked if it was a special occasion -- yes it was, my birthday!  We got there and the place was packed.  Very surprising for mid-week.  We were seated quickly and served our drinks almost immediately.  It took a little while for the waitress to come around, but when she did, we were ready to order (New York Strip Steak special).  The booth we were in was freezing cold, and our waitress reseated us right away, no problem.  Our steaks were served promptly and were perfectly done and delicious.  As I have often noticed in other places, my husband's steak was quite a bit thicker than mine, and therefore juicier.  Nothing new there.  (The man generally pays the bill and the tip, so is often given preferential treatment. No, I'm not kidding.)  We had not been served bread and butter, so we requested it.  Apparently it's an \"extra.\"  Although the waitress said she would bring it right over, it never came.    Our waitress seemed to have too many tables going and didn't stop back to our table until we were nearly finished, and I had been out of water for quite awhile.  However, other staff had stopped by to clear plates, etc., so we didn't feel ignored.  So, the food was good, the service was quick and friendly, but a few details were missing.  And my birthday?  They ignored it.  I don't mind ignoring the birthday, but they shouldn't have asked if it wasn't going to be recognized.  I waited for a few minutes for a free dessert (or something) but when it obviously wasn't coming we left.  I didn't need the calories anyway!  I'm not sure if I'll go back.  I've had better experiences with food just as good."}
{"text":"We had the avocado Chicken sandwich and the French dip along with the creamy potato soup a the honey drizzled croissants! Oh how can I forget the spinach dip and chips! I know a lot for being almost 9pm but when we're in this part of town we have to order all of our favorites at once and we weren't disappointed! Great Food and Great Service! Thanks to Austin our server for the nicely warm wet napkin w/ the lemon on top for my daughter to clean off her hands from the sticky croissants. It was a nice touch, very impressive! Job well done! Oh and thanks for letting me take your picture to post!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever.  We sat in the bar area for an early dinner and there was only one other full table. We waited 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waitress/bartender.  She took our drink order and another 20 minutes went by before she took our food order.   Once we got our food it was mediocre at best. The spinach artichoke dip was greasy with flimsy chips that kept breaking off in the dip.  I am actually vegetarian and was going to eat my friend's potato since he ordered a side of fries and it was soaked with the meat juice on his plate. Just gross. Had to order another.     To top it off the waitress never checked on us again until we were almost done and our drinks had been empty.  She was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, but there were few patrons. The other bartender was taking her sweet time as well. Won't be back - will be only going to Houston's from now on."}
{"text":"The food was on point and the atmosphere was great. I had the Short Salmon plate and my wife the Baby Back Ribs. Both were delicious but the salmon took the cake in my opinion. Portions were perfect and they even allow substitutions for the sides. This place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome place to eat. My wife and I go there almost every Tuesday night for a \"date night\" to get out together from the Child at Home. The food is just amazing, I have eaten almost every item on the menu and have not been disappointed. The waiters know us, there is never a wait for a table, and if so, it's for 10 minutes max. I really recommend the Prime Rib with Burgundy Mushrooms, they are to die for. Go there!!!...try it, trust me you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet.  No matter if you want a salad, sandwich or steak.   Great menu, great variety, great comfort food.   Only negative thing I can think of is their sirloin ( typically a special marinated in teriyaki and pineapple) is very chewy. The hostesses can be less than helpful, but normally the wait staff is great!"}
{"text":"Consistent and excellent. You have to try their ribs, I really think they are the best in town."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I have been to. The ribs are my favorite. And I can not forget about the croissants!! Delicious! Highly recommend. But is expensive."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday night at 7(ish)   Mostly because after a long flight we were famished and there was no line. People were great, but we should have realized why there was immediate seating and about 5 staff hanging around hostess station. Interior is lovely, but mostly empty of customers. We ordered from very nice, attentive waiter, then waited a very long time for fish of the day & steak to show up. One bite of fish ($33) & it was like eating a salt lick. Sent it back & waited another half hour for it to come. When it did, it was horrible! No sauce or pretty topping. Naked and tasteless & overcooked!  Waiter never came back except to present bill, so couldn't get at least a side of sauce to make it better. Steak was ordered rare, came med rare, but tasty, tho a bit tough & reasonably priced. All in all, not a good choice."}
{"text":"This is sad to write a bad review!  Charleston's is 1 of our top 2 restaurants. We come here for every family member birthday,  wedding anniversary it would total 1x per month and usually the food is great, but tonight was the worst.  The prime rib was dry.  My husband ordered \"medium rare\" but the prime rib was more well to medium.  I ordered my usual pork chops were well done and I had ordered them \"medium\". For the prices they charge they should get your desired food temperature right! !"}
{"text":"Got our food super fast, shelly was a sweet heart.  The food was so yummy, best burger I've had in a long time and fried okra too.  Manager came by to check on us and he want so friendly as well."}
{"text":"Last night had dinner for my father's 80th birthday, there was 8 of us. The entrees were outstanding . Probably he best ribs I have ever had. Banana cream pie and bread pudding were good, not great. The reason for the 3 stars was the service.  Coffee was not offered when we ordered dessert. We had to ask once the desserts arrived. It was clear that basic table maintenance is not trained at this location. Empty cocktail glasses, straws, and wet beverage napkins sat in front of us all night. When dessert arrived we had several dirty appetizer plates and forks and knives  that we needed to ask he server to clear. APPETIZER PLATES...we were on desert course and the first course plates were still on the table. normally I would blame the server, but it's clear she had no problem with her table looking like a mess when the desserts arrived. This tells me that management doesn't care and she probably was not trained properly.  This wasn't one  plate or a lose fork either. Otherwise the server was pleasant and attentive.  Even though she did not come back to refill coffee...I would come back for that food but probably wouldn't expect outstanding service."}
{"text":"Have been to Charleston's a few times and had wonderful service and excellent steaks.  It seemed like a nice romantic place, so for our 45th anniversary on 12/11/15 we chose Charleston's, fully intending to spend a 1.5-2 hr. romantic dinner including wine, appetizers etc.  Big disappointment.  Didn't even leave a tip, and we generally tip 20-30% depending upon service.  Ordered the prime rib that comes with a baked potato, added a side of burgundy mushrooms.  Wanted more time to peruse the wine list and when the waiter rushed us too much we skipped the wine.  He seemed to want to take our order, not let us look at the menu and decide either.  No wonder he got the order wrong.  We both ordered the same thing, so an easy order.  In the past we had always been given the hot bread, but he didn't bring any and didn't ask if we wanted any.  We thought perhaps they didn't do that any more until we saw other people being served the bread, so we asked why we didn't get any and were told \"you have to ask for it\".  Our orders were delivered by another person, without the baked potato.  She said she'd check on it, and came back saying the waiter misunderstood, thought we wanted to substitute the mushrooms for the baked potato.   No idea why he thought that.  Adding a side of something doesn't mean you're substituting it for something else.  I also asked for the creamy horseradish for my prime rib, which was omitted as well and I had to ask for it again.  By time the potatoes finally made it to our table, we were more than 1/2 done with our meal.  We would have ordered a salad with the meal as well,  but the waiter was in a big hurry to leave the table to turn our order in.   Really felt like we were rushed through ordering.    Really, really disappointed in the prime rib.  Choose between 10 and 14 oz., we got the 10 oz. which turned out more like between 5 and 6 oz. of edible meat - the rest was grissle and stringy meat - asked for medium rare and it was closer to rare, had to cut with the steak knife.  We'd never gotten bad steaks, always almost melt in your mouth - so very surprised the prime rib was horrible.  The best part of the whole meal was the mushrooms.  Couldn't get the waiter's attention to refill water glasses.  Our anticipated romantic anniversary dinner turned out to be a sad disaster/disappointment.  It had always been fairly quiet in the past too, which makes it romantic with the dim lighting and all, but this time, it was as loud as Texas Roadhouse or a Chili's.   They sat us at a table for 2, which is really too small, so we had to sit across from each other instead of next to each other, and with my husband's hard of hearing/understanding ears, especially in such a noisy restaurant, we could not even communicate during the meal.  Total flop anniversary celebration, due to bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"Three stars because the food was good. The chicken club was incredible with a very healthy serving of sprouts and quality bacon. The bison burger was good in that the ingredients were quality, however, seasoning was minimal and a bit more moisture could have really made it outstanding.  What's easier than a burger? You do boast a chipotle mayo on the menu but the most the burger comes with is mustard, sparingly? However my opinion may just be due to the fact that our service was far from outstanding. The waitress, while she could have been having a bad day seemed the most vocal upon us signing the check, as if to say, \"thank you for clogging my section with your peasant money.\"  I know, seemed weird to us as well. But customer service is a dying breed. If I could supply any advice it might be smile at the baby and know that every dollar holds the same value. While I'm no suburban mother and we were not in business casual the man in the tank top was a doctor and his female counterpart has a culinary degree and as transplants to the Phoenix area, I can't say we would return even for a nice adult date night."}
{"text":"I love the ribs here! Fall off the bone goodness! Salad comes with a warm croissant, yum! Had the potato soup, it was delicious too. Really great BBQ in a great atmosphere with friendly service."}
{"text":"I've passed by Charleston's often and had never visited.  The fiance took me for date night and we were pleasantly surprised!  We got the fried catfish and chicken enchiladas.  The chowder was also tasty.  The service was wonderful.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place with a good location to match. At first I thought it was an expensive place and formal dress code with the way the facility is laid out, but then realized it one night when I actually went in and discovered that is was a casual intimate setting with outstanding customer service and wonderful food that tastes so good that it leaves you coming back again and again.w would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Awesome quality on the food.  Very good service. Have eaten here several times and have always been impressed with the quality.  My wife got the pork chop and said it was on of the best. I had the Hickory burger and it was great.  Guess this is now on our list."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 7 here on a Friday night for a friends bday dinner. The atmosphere is cozy, lights are dimmed and it's nice place for group dinner and drinks.  The croissants were amazing. We had 2 orders of those. The server was courteous and was helpful when we had questions about the dishes. He  recommended the \"flirtini\" drink for the girls which is not too sweet it was good and the boys ordered beer. Our friend that been here before recommended no appetizers because the meals were very big  portions.  My husband ordered the pork chops well done with vegetable and beans. I ordered the chicken fried steak, gravy on the side with carrots and mash potatoes. They were both amazing. Very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The beans were the only thing that I would replace with a different side if we ever come back here, but other then that this place was very good and the service was on point."}
{"text":"Food was very good, however service was not. We were seated and given drinks. Finished drinks and still no waitress. It took 20 minutes before our order was taken - at 9:00 at night. It was not busy. I ordered steak and angle hair pasta. I noticed there was no cheese on the pasta. She said she'd bring me out some. Finished my steak, still no cheese. When I decided to eat my pasta sans cheese I noticed that it hadn't been flavored at all. Asked the waitress again, this time she brought sauce and cheese for me to make. It was cold at this point. Very disappointing as the food is really good - just not worth the hassle. (Not being picky -this has happened before at this restaurant.)."}
{"text":"Tried to call in a to go order at 7:15 on a Monday night, I gave up when I was still on hold at 7:30 after being transferred from a hostess"}
{"text":"One of the better chains in town. Their ribs are excellent, as is the potato soup. I also like the dark upscale atmosphere - very much like a Houston's. Top notch staff - the service here is impeccable."}
{"text":"The decor here is beautiful, so if you're looking to take someone on a date night this is the place.  That said be prepared to shell out some serious cash, especially if you buy alcohol.  Nevertheless, the chicken parmesan I got was super tasty.  It had the perfect balance between too much and too little breading, which for me can break the dish.  The server was quick and attentive so I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Charleston Chandler Az. First time there. Very impressive ambiance. Ate in the bar. Very comfortable leather seated booths. Very pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff. I had Chili, Rueben Sandwich and Cole Slaw. Food was tasty and welll seasoned.  Aaron was our waiter and he was very attentive and friendly. Refilled our drinks regularly and cleaned table of finished dishes.  Impressed with their luxury ambiance and comfort. Good fresh food with friendly service. Will return again no doubt.. :-)"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after seeing their television commercials.  Visited on a Friday evening and the place was packed though strangely enough by many seniors. Parking was troublesome and we had to find parking at an adjoining parking lot associated with business offices. Wait was about 20-25 minutes.  There was ample seating inside to wait but we chose to wait outside but sadly there was only 1 bench to sit on. Staff greeted us warmly.  Waitress was pleasant but never visited us throughout the meal to check up on us to see if the meal was satisfactory if I need a refill on my drink (Old Fashioned) (-1). Inside - tables were cleaned quickly, lighting was a dark, did notice when we were leaving there was food on the floor.  The restaurant can be a bit on the noisy as it was packed. Food was plentiful, very tasty, and very well seasoned.  Plates can be on the pricey side starting from the mid-teens to above $20-25.  Menu could be a little more varied in my opinion but definitely worth a revisit."}
{"text":"Best italian place in mesa!they haave great service and great food. This place is true. Italian not main stream like olive garden. Its a very quiet place which can make for a very romantic meal."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation from So. Cal and will not hesitate to go back whenever I find my way back to Scottsdale. The food was excellent (ribs), and the service (Andrew & crew) couldn't have been better. The Chicken Marsala was tasty, but could use a splash more Marsala. I don't do many reviews, but feel I need to give credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"Best spinach dip!  Love the salads!  Order the creamy garlic dressing or the vinaigrette they are wonderful.  The rotisserie chicken is enough to share.  The service is usually good, but occasionally it isn't the best."}
{"text":"SUPER tender 8oz filet done exactly how I requested, broccoli was steamed nicely and baked potato as requested.  Very quick and friendly service at the bar!  And, fairly inexpensive for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken Sandwich, Seafood salad is my favorite their excellent food, Haven't been disappointed yet"}
{"text":"Outside this place looked like any other chain restaurant.   Inside a very very pleasant surprise.  It was amazingly beautiful.  Service was great.  They kept refilling my water.  I also ordered this chicken with broccoli and it was delicious.  They gave me so much broccoli I loved it.     Anyhowz I would definitely recommend this place to anybody.  Great chain restaurant if it is one."}
{"text":"Went in a few weeks back for dinner and tried the flatbread pizza and hickory burger. Both were really good, as was the service. The place has an older vibe to it like it was decorated in the 80's and might cater to an older crowd but it's good food and a subdued setting."}
{"text":"Very good food and great friendly service. Very relaxing and family friendly environment.   Our server was very nice but she did not seem knowledgeable about the menu. There were a couple discrepancies with our order. Nothing major- no deal breakers. Still a great place.   Also, they gave a military discount of 50% which is amazing. I'm glad some businesses still care about those serving this great country.   Kudos to you Charleston's! We will be back (again) next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Everything was really good, service was great, food was great.... the Queso was Bombbbbbb!!! I would highly recommend ppl to come"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I come to Charlestons primarily for their oven roasted chicken (which is fantastic, though I wish was available in all dark meat) and their croissants, which should be outlawed for simply being insanely good and perfectly done up.  Their glazed carrots are everything glazed carrots should be: sweet, delicious, and perfectly cooked. Their mashed potatoes have a ton of flavor as well, and even if this is a done-up chain type restaurant, this place gets it right a fair amount of the time. I almost feel guilty enjoying it as much as I do, but it's really damn decent food for a relatively decent price. (I had the burger recently, which was only so-so, as they were out of my chicken, but the champagne vinaigrette salad is awesome.)  Most of the time, I get curbside takeout, which is fast and efficient, but seating inside is nice if there aren't screaming kids. The music trends from decent to absolutely awful, but I don't know how much control anyone there has over that. And it's nice and dark and comfy if you eat in."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  We've been to this restaurant 5 or 6 times and it gets better every time.  Amazing food, cozy romantic dining atmosphere, impeccable service, exceptionally clean, and reasonably priced.  I had the aged prime rib and my wife had the shrimp scampi.  My prime rib was perfectly done, tender and deliciously flavored.  The baked potatoe was the type of potatoe that demanded you eat the whole thing.... skin and all.  I also had a Long Island ice tea with my meal.  It was the best I've ever had.  So good... I had to have a second one.  It is so nice to basically have this restaurant in our back yard.  A heavenly dining experience to say the least!"}
{"text":"Everything was spot on, the Chicken Picatta, the Sirloin Steak and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Excellent service and superb food make Charleston's our new go-to spot for a good meal. My steak was exceptionally flavorful. The Chicken Picatta came with sautéd fresh veggies and every entree was fresh and hot when presented at table. We finished with an excellent, not too sweet Bread Pudding with a subtle Grand Mariner cream. My teen dubbed the Parmesan Chicken \"legendary\" as she gobbled up the lightly dressed fresh mozzarella and greens between bites of chicken."}
{"text":"We were staying locally at the Westin and my wife wanted a great salad under $20. I did a quick Yelp search and found this resturantant.   The artichoke dip was excellent, they actually provided a generous portion enough for 4 and even better enough chips.    My wife the Waldorf Chicken salad - absolutely amazing. The apples were crisp and strawberries perfectly ripe. The grilled chicken was tender and the pecans were an excellent addition.  I had the Hickory burger. The best part about the burger was I ordered it to be medium and it actually was cooked to medium, perfect. It was a very flavorful and juicy burger.  My wife really liked the atmosphere, it had an upscale feeling without upscale prices.   The bar area looked very nice, we might visit one night without the kids."}
{"text":"Charleston's is a great restaurant with top notch food.  The wine list is comprised of affordable delicious choices without being too extensive.  The food is fresh and well prepared.  Nothing gimicky or confusing about the process or the preparation.  Straight forward old style steakhouse with meat, fish, vegetables.  Fast, friendly, attentive service.  For a chain, this is the best you can get with a great location too."}
{"text":"We come here every couple weeks, because it's close by, the food and service are consistently good, and because my son is nuts about their ribs.  To put finer points on all that, let's start with the staff.  They are always, to a person, extremely friendly and attentive.  I've never once experienced a dud.   Your soda and water glasses will never go empty and they'll always serve with a smile.  Now, the food.   My only complaint here is they don't do half-sandwiches, and I wish they would, because the portions are huge and there's only so much anyone needs to eat at one sitting.  But they are good.   The ribs are probably one of the best things on the menu, and frankly, they blow away the crap served down the road at Rudy's and Can't Stop Smokin'.    Now, are Charleston's ribs barbecued for hours?  No, they're grilled, but they're amazingly tender and flavorful and they taste *good* every single time.   The croissants are like little pillows of heaven.  I don't know how they do it, but i have never in my life had croissants as good as these.  Last night I tried the Walt's Champagne Chicken salad for the first time.  WOW, what a nice, flavorful, balanced salad.  I'll definitely be doing that again.  The potato soup is to die for.  The ambience of the place is fairly typical suburban upper-midscale.  It's casual, but if you're wearing flip-flops and pajamas this place isn't for you.  Frankly, no place is, but this place for sure.     Two thumbs up from me...this place is a winner every single time."}
{"text":"THE  best restaurant in town. Great consistent service, and excellent food. The fillets melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time in Mesa. The food, atmosphere, and service are all top-notch. I go here anytime I'm feeling a craving for my favorite chicken avocado club sandwich. My favorite part might be the seating and romantic lighting."}
{"text":"I love this place. I visit anytime I'm in town. The chicken fried steak is my absolute favorite along with their glazed carrots. SO GOOD. However , on this last visit I was saddened to find  they changed their ambient music to what I can only compare to very stuffy \"soft jazz\". I find it hard to watch a basketball game with Kenny G blaring in the background. I feel like I'm waiting for someone to tell me they'll be right back after this break. It may be be a deal for some, but it is for me.   Flutes and burgers? No. Thank. You."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for approximately 3 years because of their consistency  Like any casual restaurant if there is a wait, they take your first name down, the difference is that the hostess are personable.   The service is is attentive, they refill beverages quickly. They are always happy and helpful.   The waiters/waitress all seem to enjoy what they do.  We always start with a house salad and it comes with lightest, flakey , buttery croissant that I have ever had.   If in the mood for lunch fare they have a wonderful chicken club sandwich.  If you are in the mood for soup. I would recommend the potato soup, it's outstanding.  The best for last,  the ribs are tender, tasty,  and meat falls of the bone.  I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Their fried okra is always amazing (even people who hate okra eat this stuff). Just tried their chicken salad w/ champagne vinaigrette and it was incredible (this from the girl who believes that fat equals love)."}
{"text":"First off this was our first time back in many, many years.  We use to be regulars way back when. We decided to give it a try for our anniversary tonight. The service is A+, awesome and we can't say enough good about our waiter Ace.  The appetizer was delicious, highly recommend the shrimpcargo and because it was happy hour it was half price. We both ordered the 10 oz. prime rib medium rare. My husband had the baked potato and I had mixed veggies.  We asked for raw horseradish and Ace got it for us right away.  The food came out faster than I could ever have imagined! Maybe even too quick. The prime rib was tough :( but I was starving and ate it all. My husband also noticed and we did mention it to our terrific waiter. He said he would let the kitchen know. Disappointed by the prime rib and my husband was also disappointed in the baked potato the skin was extremely tough just like the prime rib.  Glad we tried it again, but wish we hadn't ordered the prime rib."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here had to of been 10-15 years ago. I was convinced it was going to be slow and no wait. But to my surprise it was a full house! And there was a wait. Only 10-15mins.  Once we put our names in, a flood of people came in. Wait wasn't long at all.  We started with the spinach dip. Hubs loved it and he doesn't even like spinach. I ordered a cup of clam chowder. Didn't taste fishy but had more bacon than clams.  My mom ordered the shrimp scampi pasta. LARGE shrimp and a great lemon flavor.  Hub got the chicken and rib plate. It came with beans and mashed potatoes. The chicken was half a rotisserie chicken and it was the most flavorful chicken I've ever tasted. I am thinking I want to just order the chicken next Time. Ribs were super tender. Sauce was too sweet for me.  Then me. I got the special which was a Hawaiian Sirloin. Marinated in pineapple juice and soy sauce for a couple days. It was very tender and good cut of sirloin.  Service was great! Our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. Food was very tasty and flavorful. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"alright, so im not madly in love with this place nor do i despise it.  The menu is relatively short, and yes this can be a good thing, because one would think that the items they do have would be top notch delish. BUT for someone who like variety (pointing at self) it can be somewhat disappointing.   They have soups, sandwiches, salads, steaks, ribs, fish, chicken..with your common steak restaurant sides. beans, taters,, veggies etc. ( no mac :(   ). I tired the chicken marsala. It was alright, didn't send my taste buds into taste explosion or anything. b/f enjoyed his country fried steak. Portions are pretty decent.  The spinach dip is o.k too. The carrots are the bomb-diggity though as well as the mashed taters. I am just a baby when it come to my food and hate when my sides are better than the main entree.  Atmosphere is nice and dark and semi romantic.  oh yeah and i forgot to put the leftovers in the refrigerator, goes to show you how eager i was to eat it the next day."}
{"text":"Amazing service and consistent food quality!"}
{"text":"I knew going in that this was not my type of place but I was with a friend so I gave it a shot. It is extremely dark on the inside and the food was not terribly good. The chicken was alright (moist and had some flavor), but I was not impressed with the ribs or mashed potatoes - seems like they might have had mayonnaise in them. That doesn't mean the other food is not good but I didn't enjoy what I had."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Literally have never had a bad experience here! Never a wait for a table, I love coming here! The Caesar salad here is amazing. The chicken club sandwich is the best! And my boyfriend got the ribs and chicken combo and loves it! Literally everyone we have brought here loves it..all their dishes turn out the way they ordered them and taste delicious!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Charleston's for quite a while now. Generally the food is pretty good. I recommend the baked potato soup,  The glazed carrots, any of their salads, and a steak. The service is always pretty nice. I like the ambience of a dark woodpaneled steakhouse. Overall this is a nice place to have dinner. Every time my aunt and uncle visit from Massachusetts they want to eat here. I will happily meet them there for dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here last minute for a graduation party because the wait at Texas Roadhouse was wayyyy too long. Not only did they accommodate a last minute party of 15, but the service was great and the food delicious."}
{"text":"The best ribs I have ever tasted.  Better than any BBQ restaurant that I've ever eaten at.  Everything that comes with your meal is tasty also.  Fresh ice cold salad with a warm sweet croissant roll!  Baked beans that could bear the name chili in most restaurants,  and glazed carrots for anyone who is a sweet potato fan.  The service is equally as exceptional."}
{"text":"Have been to this location now three times and it is always amazing!   The location is right by the US 60 and is easy to get to.   We have tried their chicken sandwich, chicken tenders, and their chicken and rib platter with mashed potatoes. We have also tried their fries, coleslaw, and vegetables. Their vanilla ice cream is the kind with the actual vanilla beans if you are a fan of vanilla. The food is amazing and the service is excellent!  Our server today was Lynn who is not only a pretty face but one of the best servers we have ever seen. She has served me twice here and each time was amazing! Today Lynn took the time to walk us to the door when our meal was done just to say goodbye,  nicest person I can remember meeting, like ever!"}
{"text":"Charleston's has great food and a great menu. They have good steaks and I won't order ribs anywhere else than here. Unfortunately, I don't go there as much as I would, because the prices keep going up and are less reasonable. What used to include a salad (with an amazing crossaint), now is much more plus a salad is extra. Meanwhile, there are like three hostesses at 4:00 ( when it's near empty) that are so bored it takes two to open the doors for you. I'd rather open my own door and have more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going to Charleston's but this last time we were a little disappointed.  The food was not as good as most of our other trips here.  I ordered the chicken salad, and the greens were obviously from a bulk pre-chopped mix. and had a chemical taste.  I was surprised because their claim to fame is that everything is made fresh each day.  I asked for my dressing to come on the side and before I was quite done with my salad, a server buzzed by and grabbed it, thinking I was finished and took it back to the kitchen area (I guess she thought I was finished, but I still had salad left that I was eating, so I just left it and didn't finish it) We didn't complain because it was a special occasion and didn't want to ruin it with any drama.  The salad itself was supposed to come with chopped eggs, and I expected more than the table spoon or so I got in my salad.  The amount of chicken was ok, but I think for the price should have been a little more in there.  Those big hunks of dried out purple cabbage were not appealing either.  I am giving 3 stars because the margarita was delicious, the key lime pie was very good and the service was pretty good, except for that person who buzzed by to prematurely take away my salad dressing.  Hope our next trip turns out better!"}
{"text":"Went there with a work group for lunch.  The food was outstanding!  I had he French dip with baked potato soup and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Steak was good and food was for the most part quite average. Service was a bit over the top when it came to refills on the soft drinks. Never been someplace where it was such a big priority. After the 3rd or fourth round of refills before previous drinks were even half way empty it became annoying."}
{"text":"Happy hour is very tasty and so are their menus! They deliver what they describe and claim to be: an outstanding food chain."}
{"text":"Excellent Food at a reasonable price served in a great ambiance.  Waiter forgot our appetizers, offered to make amends."}
{"text":"This meal was sub par at best. Ordered a French dip and it came cold, which was fine. But I dipped it into the au jus and took a bite and it literally tasted like dog food. It tasted like how cheap dog food smells. The waitress only came back two, maybe three times and our drinks had been empty for quite some time. My sister had to go up to the bar to get her drink refilled. It took her so long to come back and I was so hungry since I didn't eat all day, I ate the plain sandwich with nothing to dip it. When she finally came back I was almost done and she waited until absolute last second and she's walking away to ask how our food was and I told her about the au jus and all she did was stare at me blankly and then say sorry and left. Didn't offer to fix the au jus or see if they could fix it. The meat itself aside from being cold was fine, but the au just was HORRIBLE. The menu fails to tell you the shrimp scampi has red pepper flakes in it. 3 people at our table got the same exact shrimp scampi, aside from one having no tomatoes. Each of them tasted completely different. One was fine, one tasted like strong lemon, and one was incredibly spicy. My friend is somewhat a wimp when it comes to spice that I at first discredited her complaints, so I tried it for myself and it was spicy even for me, and I love spicy things. When the waitress came back for the bill we asked if there were flakes of it and she said \"uhhhhh.. oh... yeah... there is....?\" As If she almost didn't want to say anything. For the crazy prices we pay at this place, this meal was a complete joke."}
{"text":"Once again the ratings on yelp came through. Tried Charleston's, the food was great. Went with the fried catfish. Very tasty and good portions. No room for dessert.  The price was reasonable.  There was a nice ambiance, and the service was very good. If I have time I'd like to go back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, the food was fresh and cooked to perfection. I had the chicken fried steak and it was big enough to take another meal home in leftovers.  The service was great, always filled up our glasses and didn't leave the dirty plates on the table for more than a minute.  This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!"}
{"text":"Just had the trout, fantastic!  Washed it down with a Prescott liquid amber ale and it was great. One of the ladies I was with fell in love with the parm crusted chicken. Then Hank walked in he was running all over the restaurant dancing. He kept yelling, \"look at me!  I'm doing the Charleston, in Chareston's!\"  No one was amused by his behavior.  I recommend Charleston's.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Only been here once but I will not be back so here is my review. While the service staff seemed very nice the place smelled like stale beer. Kind of a dump really."}
{"text":"This place is okay. went a long time ago and haven't in a while. a little pricey but i think the roasted chicken is the best"}
{"text":"Charleston's is always good! My wife and I had a great dinner here tonight after a road trip and we couldn't have picked a better spot. I had a delicious bison burger and it was perfect and my wife had a salad. Of course we are way too many of their honey drizzled croissants. Those are amazing.   Also a huge compliment to our server Danielle. She was super professional, friendly, and nice. The food and her service made our night! Thanks Danielle!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The food was delicious, and our reservation was respected promptly on arrival. We got a booth as we requested. The prices are comparable, and the baked potato soup was absolutely delicious. The stag is very friendly. I've been here for business lunches and date nights with my wife. This restaurant makes for a perfect choice for either occasion. I highly recommend the Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken as well."}
{"text":"My best friend brought me here for my birthday and it was such a treat. Everything was spectacular.Would give more than five stars if I could. Absolutely loved it and will go again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times in the past 18 months or so.  I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  I would eat here more often if it were closer to home.  Tonight's dinner was once again a hit.  My glass never got below half filled before our server brought another drink.  He was very attentive!  The food was delicious as always.  Great atmosphere.  Would be a nice place for a quiet romantic dinner.  It's dark and the booths give some privacy.   They are also able to accommodate large parties (not separate dining room large parties but maybe 20 at a LONG table)."}
{"text":"The famous French dip is absolutely amazing. Easily one of the Best we've had, with an ample portion of beef with a prefect roll for dipping in au jus or horseradish. The burgundy mushroom side dish was delicious as well with rich flavor. Definitely will be coming back !"}
{"text":"I felt like having steak one evening and I don't get to go to many steak houses so we decided to try this place out.   Everything was pretty much on point here. No wait for a table when we arrived. I ordered the Prime top sirloin with a side of rice. This was an 8 oz steak. I always order my steaks medium and this came out exactly that. It was super tender and just the right size because I actually finished it. It wasn't too much or not enough. I had some of my boyfriend's mashed potatoes as well. I'm usually not a big fan of mashed potatoes but these were actually pretty good. I also ordered the Sweet Peach Tini which was delicious. I felt like I was drinking an Iced Tea.   Everything was really good as well as the service. I'll definitely be back if I want another steak! =)"}
{"text":"Place was nice and quiet and worked well for a business meeting. It was a bit dark, but Overall was a pleasant place to meet. The waitress was attentive and cared for our parties needs. We had time restraints, and the food came quickly allowing us enough time to enjoy our food and meet our commitments. Had the French dip and it was amazing. The meat had great flavor and the bread was nice and soft. Would eat here again"}
{"text":"First visit and we were impressed. Excellent food and service. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious large lunch menu. Five star service. The meals were coursed out like a fine dining restaurant. The waiter knew just when to bring out the salads after the appetizers. Unlimited refills on soda kept appearing without even asking. The wait staff was team service so everyone was willing to help out. The portions were large for me so I had plenty to take for left overs. The entire restaurant was busy but didn't seem overwhelming or noisy. Great for lunch. I look forward next time the dinner and desserts."}
{"text":"Very Fast service. The prime rib was excellent.  The waitress Liz P.  Was very good.  Checked on our drinks if they needed to be refilled at least three times and asked me if I wanted horseradish to take home with my left overs.  No place has never asked me that.  Out standing service!!!"}
{"text":"This is excellent restaurant good service nice atmosphere and the best Chicken picota I've ever had. That's saying a lot because I'm an old Italian cook for the last 40 yrs."}
{"text":"The house salad and any of the steaks are delicious. I prefer mine done medium-well and this is about the best steak place that I have been to."}
{"text":"I love Charleston's.  For a chain operation, it's about as good as it gets, and that rates the coveted 5-star rating on the Brak-o-meter®.  The menu is relatively short.  I appreciate and respect this, as it means that the restaurant can concentrate on a relative few items, and simplifies managing their food inventory.  I've never had anything I didn't like, with particular favorites being the pork chops, ribs, chicken tenders (prepared from fresh chicken and served in a very generous portion), and various salads.  The decor and atmosphere is great, with a very darkened interior, yet just-right lighting over the tables/booths.  The service is consistently friendly and prompt.  Pricing is very fair for the quality of the food, and the portions are large.  On our last visit, I tried a new meat loaf dish that had just been added to the menu.  It was good, though probably not something I'd order again as there are other things I like even better.  I was asked how I liked it, and said it was \"ok\", and immediately got a visit from a concerned manager, who offered to swap it for something else on the menu.  I had to clarify that \"ok\" in this case meant that it was good, just not something I'd opt for again.  His concern was genuine and he was genuinely nice about it, not being the least bit condescending.  I really appreciated this.  Doesn't surprise me as it's consistent with the kind of attention and service we've always received here, and we've been many times.  Give Charleston's a try if you haven't already.. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice but the food and service wasn't. Our waitress started the evening by telling us she was tired and had been on since 11am. Great! We didn't expect much after that and we got what we expected. She forgot our drink orders, we had to wave down other waiters to either try and locate her or get what we needed. The food was ok. Nothing spectacular. My husband liked his fish (the special), my kids liked their meals. My parmesan chicken was definitely not parmesan chicken. Dry as can be and barely any sauce and no cheese at all. Our friend, who joined us, mistakenly ordered the same thing and we both agreed the worse parmesan chicken we've ever eaten. I have to say, the bread pudding....AMAZING! 2 stars for the bread pudding....otherwise I would have given it a 1. To finish our wonderful (not) experience, our waitress handed us the bill before dessert even came because she was calling it a night. We still tipped her and wished her well but she definitely played a big part of us not enjoying our evening. Wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"'Ello chaps!  Stopped in at the Charleston in Scottsdale. I've had better. The restaurant is lovely and service is fine, but the menu is quite bare. Not much to offer. Food was okay."}
{"text":"The hamburgers here were juicy, and incredibly delicious. The fries were delicious and at a great temperature. It was a great place to dine in."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed Charlestons for over 15 years. It's about time that I offered up my thoughts on this establishment.  The restaurant has been a solid pick for us many times a year. We have eaten there with larger family groups, as well as with friends, and just the two of us. I cannot recall a time when something went wrong that wasn't taken care of by the management. For as many times as we have been there, the consistency of the service has been excellent, the food reliably quick and prepared as expected.  We have enjoyed being able to get seats quickly, who for its quality, surprises me that the wait times aren't longer. That's not to say during prime hours that there is never a wait, but if a restaurant is going to have seats it is going to be charlestons.   We call in for reservations, and. Rarely wait more than a few minutes. We love the atmosphere as well. It's dark, lots of brick and wood, making you feel like it's a more expensive restaurant than it is. There is a menu item for everyone in terms of price. I have heard it said that the selection is narrow, but we like the simplicity of it. My wife goes for the salmon and I for the filet. We both love the croissants with the salads. Happy dining"}
{"text":"Come here often for business meetings. EXCELLENT establishment. Food, service, atmosphere are a 10. Especially the staff. No where of equal or greater price or quality have I ever gotten consistent service from multiple servers the way I have here. Otherwise try the porkchops. Not something I would usually get but YUM."}
{"text":"Great find. I dined here while staying at a nearby hotel. I was a bit feed up with paying premium prices for meals. Charleston's impressed. I liked the vibe and ambiance. It was cozy and romantic and the bar area had plenty of booths for a more casual atmosphere. The prices were on point. I enjoyed the top sirloin which was cooked exactly as I asked. The Brussels were shaved and to my liking. I was shocked that I had to add salt to the food but was in love with the fact that, for once, everything wasn't loaded with salt ahead of time. I will definitely return.  My white was very attentive and made me a very yummy greyhound up  .  I had to try a desert- I went for the bread pudding. It was a good size portion, too much for one, bit it was yummy. Perhaps to many reasons but I just picked around them."}
{"text":"It was okay, very much like J Alexanders or Houston's.  My food was good but not over the top.  When paying almost $20 for chicken strips you expect over the top."}
{"text":"Their chicken fried steak was the best I've ever had. TexAz has now moved into second place."}
{"text":"We ordered the ribs from here to go and I could not be happier. Exactly what the other reviews stated, the meat just fell off the bone. This will definitely be my go to ribs place. Good thing I don't crave them too often cause they are a bit expensive."}
{"text":"really good food, reminds me of Houston's.  From the chicken to the ribs, all the food was good.  Drinks were not bad and service was pretty good.  Prices were also reasonable, would certainly go back."}
{"text":"I am not sure about the service as the waiter took our drink orders and disappeared for the longest time. Our food arrived without our drinks. We had to remind him when he came by later. So not so great service. Food was good."}
{"text":"The shrimpcargo is to die for (and might be rich enough to kill).  Food (pork chops in my case) excellently prepared and seasoned. Vegetables were al dente and just right.   Server was attentive without being in the way and was polite and pleasant  All told a fine meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always friendly and they accommodate our 2-year-old beautifully.  Servers though do seem kind of phony, but at least they are always smiling.   Food is always amazing no matter what I order. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been there once & ordered the Cobb salad. It was good. Not enough dressing given. Lighting is way too dark, I understand intimate lighting but I feel it's too much. Food & staff were wonderful."}
{"text":"I've come here many times over the years and usually get the burgers or happy hour food and drink. They do a consistent good job on service and food preparation. They do a happy hour with half price appetizers and drink specials. Food has always come out cooked correctly and the staff is courteous and friendly. It kind of reminds me of a slightly less upscale Houston's with a similar menu and feel. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for American food with good service and value."}
{"text":"I love Charlestons! The glazed carrots are hands down my favorite. Yesterday we had Ashley as a server for lunch and she was fantastic."}
{"text":"Try the Barbecue Baby Back Ribs!! It's absolutely FANTASTIC!! The meat is so tasty and tender, the beans and the baked potato are delicious!! It's a nice pretty cheap steakhouse, I definitely recommend it! :-)"}
{"text":"Recommended by BMW chandler, Mark.  Super great place for lunch. We split the Reuben with slaw...Yea. Perfect size and delicious. Fantastic service from Julie, who covered the whole bar area by herself. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I was invited here by my grandparents for their last dinner while they were in town before heading back to the midwest and had no idea what to expect... but I was pleasantly surprised.  To start out with, it is tucked behind several other chain restaurants and backed right up to highway 10 (don't worry you can't hear any of the traffic once you're inside!). So if you think you're in the wrong place keep driving through the parking lot towards the highway - it'll show up eventually.  The restaurant itself is a nice, dimly lit almost wine cellar looking place. The booths were comfortable and the noise level was quiet enough to hold a pretty good conversation. The service wasn't anything to write home about but at least they weren't rude. On the other hand, their croissants that come with your meal... I almost wrote 12 letters home to my mom because they were so fantastic, but be prepared you only get one with your meal so eat it wisely (or just be prepared to pay a little extra if you really need more!). The entrees were reasonably priced for what you get. My chicken was cooked well and very filling and my grandparents raved about their ribs.  So overall: good food, ok price, and ok service. i.e. - 4 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Loved the shrimp, the filet, the cocktails and the service. Pricey but great place for a celebratory dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a glorified Denny's, with inflated prices. My mother-in-law's food was served a good 10 minutes after everyone else's and then they tried to deliver the wrong food to my daughter. She finally got her grilled cheese sandwich another 10 minutes later. They gave us two free desserts but still charged us for the belated meals. I had to wait and wait and wait for my second glass of wine and finally had to ask the manager to retrieve it for me.  The loaded potato soup was super tasty but my spinach chicken salad was just meh. My aunt-in-law raved about her fried catfish (but was furious about the service). The coconut crusted shrimp was good, as were the burgers. Good, crispy fries. Everyone loved the apple cobbler (I didn't have any because I'm gluten-free.)   Overall, they offer a boring menu, just okay food and mediocre (if friendly) service."}
{"text":"Update: The manager contacted us and was very concerned about our review. It was very nice to hear from him personally and via the mail, and know that he wants his customers to have a good dining experience. Apparently, there was a glitch in the GF menu that they were not aware of. We will try Charleston's again soon and will update again.  Service was terrible. I am gluten free and checked the GF menu online. I ordered the filet mignon. It was supposed to come with a salad but the waitress insisted I had to pay an extra $5 to get it. I told her it was on the GF menus that it came with salad. But she said no. I didn't want to fight with her and said forget it. We were with out of town company. Although the the filet was good, I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints ! Great steak, shrimp cargot and the Croissants are out if this world! I have had the Reuben, carrots, salads and they are all a ten! Don't miss this place !"}
{"text":"We love this place for a good dinner. The salads are great. The chicken fingers are the best I've ever had. The chicken fried steak is HUGE and delicious. My husband goes crazy for the croissants and glazed carrots. Yum! Also, try the key lime pie!  My only complaint is the mashed potatoes. They mix in lots of big peppercorns, which I hate. I asked if they could exclude the pepper and they said it wasn't possible, for some reason. Mashed potatoes are my favorite side, so this is a big bummer."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse and the bread pudding is to die for and addicting.  Very causal yet elegant place. Great for any celebration or just dinner before the show."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! Fresh Guacamole & Chips were excellent! Atmosphere was fantastic!  Was in Phoenix on business and went to Charleston's on a recommendation from a friend back home.  I don't enjoy dining by myself when travelling, so I tend to find a place at the bar and watch a game or read a book while eating.  The service was outstanding!  Both the manager and the bartender were great; friendly, warm, & welcoming.  The ribs came recommended (which was my plan) but I started out with a 1/2 off appetizer of fresh guacamole & chip and a happy hour Amber Ale.  I realized quickly that the appetizer was going to do me.  My only regret ... I didn't get to try the ribs.  The table behind me ordered some as I was getting ready to leave and they smelled incredible."}
{"text":"I love Charleston's! Consistently good service and good food!  Last time in I had the pork chops with their special mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.  All were excellent, tasty and well prepared.  Also on our favorites list is the French Dip Roast beef sandwich.  And their salads are fresh with flavorful dressings.  I much prefer Charleston's to the nearby  White Chocolate Grill."}
{"text":"Reservations had been made for our family to have dinner in Christmas Eve in October, confirmed in November. My elderly mother looks forward to this  10 year long tradition all year long.       Unfortunately, upon arrival, we were informed that there was no reservation for our group. Mother begins to cry, believing she had let her family down, as she always makes the reservations. We asked the manager if there was ANYTHING that could be done and were told that they were full because it was Christmas Eve. I remember an inn that had no room once, also.       The good news is, we were still able to be together and have dinner as a family. Chili's, next door to Charleston's was wonderful and we dined there. I know. Chili's lacks the upscale qualities of Charleston's. However, the most important thing was that we were all together, and they understood that and helped us out.       The bad news, we gave mom gift cards to Charleston's for Christmas. Oh, well. It gave us all a good laugh when she said she would never go there again.       Updated review:      On Thursday of last week I received notification from Hal S. asking for my contact information so that an area partner could contact me. I left my cell number and private email address. I left that information the same day it was requested. On Friday I again sent my information. Tomorrow will be a week since I was told that I would be contacted. I have had no contact, either by phone or by email.       I continue to believe that there needs to be a greater emphasis on customer service. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate here twice while in Phoenix on a 3 day work trip from Texas. (Lunch and dinner). Both occasions, the food and service were great. I had the Top Sirloin and baked potato on visit #1. On visit #2, I had the Walt's Champagne Chicken Salad. It was amazing. Their pizzas looked delicious as well. I highly recommend visiting this location!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple more times and have to downgrade it to 3 stars for the food and service.  Nothing in particular... just overall not as good as what we experienced the first time we went there."}
{"text":"Recommend making reservations during dinner!    Great service, large portions and great food!    A more detailed review coming soon!"}
{"text":"Was very surprised just how good the food and restaurant was.  I had never heard of Charleston's, but I am a big fan now. Place gets crowded so plan your meal time with friends around their high traffic.  I will go back as the roast beef was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to give a place five stars after eating there once, but upon reflection, it was really an excellent meal.  We met friends there before going to see a movie and arrived after they had ordered.  Our drinks were brought quickly, our food was fairly prompt arriving, and it was GOOD.  I was going back and forth between a burger and a chicken sandwich with avocado and sprouts and went with the latter and a side of barbecued baked beans.  The beans were great, though boiling hot and they did a number on the roof of my mouth.  The sandwich was also great and huge: I ate half of it as I wanted popcorn at the movie.  Because of a toothache, I decided to have a Mudslide.  When it arrived, it was a bit different than what I was expecting.  I'm used to this drink being in a daiquiri glass that had chocolate syrup drizzled in it and probably more of a dilute milkshake consistency.  This was in a much shorter glass, had more icecubes in it, but the flavor was great.  And it was potent.  I was feeling it after one drink, which really helped with my tooth.  And yes, I made sure the prescription didn't have a problem with alcohol, and my wife was driving home that night.  After the movie we went for dessert as the parking lot was absolutely crazy with two full theaters letting out at the same time, we wanted to burn some time to get out more easily.  Even though it was now half an hour before their posted closing time, no problems getting a booth.  The waitress was a little slow getting to us, but she was prompt and provided good service once things got moving.  She seemed to be the only waitress in the main dining room and was servicing another group, plus probably doing shut-down tasks.  All we wanted was to split a slice of their key lime pie, and I have to say that it was one of the best key lime pies that I've ever had.  Real key limes, a walnut/graham cracker crust, and really yummy whipped cream.  And a size that was perfect for sharing.  I've had a lot of key limes over the years that ranged from key lime in name only to exceptional ones, and this was one of the best.  I would seriously consider coming here just for dessert if I were in the area, but I would not hesitate to come here again for a full dinner experience.  I with we'd arrived earlier and met with our friends on-time, but Phoenix freeways being what they are it just wasn't possible.  Definitely recommended place and not too pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"Where to start?  A friend recommended this place.  Service:  We went later in the night so it wasn't busy at all. However, you would've thought it was packed because we had to wait a while to get drinks; refills; our order taken; condiments after getting our food (had to ask him twice); and finally, the bill.   Food:  After reading the reviews on Yelp, and our friend's suggestion, I really wanted to try their chicken fried steak. Well, that was a bad idea because it was difficult to chew, the gravy looked like it had been out for too long and starting to curdle, and the extremely sweet candied carrots took up over a quarter of the plate, BUT the mashed potatoes were delicious.  The bf got the rack of ribs, which I got to try and that is the only reason this place gets two stars, because the whole night and all through the next day I had FOOD POISONING!!!!  I wish I had listened to Renee S.' review and steered clear from this place...never again!"}
{"text":"Reasonably good food albeit expensive.  $14 for a Ruben that while good, wasn't $14 worth of good.  Brussel sprouts were ok but could have been cooked a little more.   Shrimp scampi was meh."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken club salad and shrimp scampi.  Both were surprisingly good.    Only complaints are that I found the menu to be a little short and the fact that they want $5 for a salad with an entree.  Oh...almost forgot...the booth we sat in was a tad odd.  I'm not a short person, but sitting in the booth the seat seemed to be so low that the table height was right at chest level."}
{"text":"I definitely look forward to going back to this location since having Charleston's in OKC and I think I found my favorite dish in the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  The ambiance and service have always been good, and the food good, but now I look forward to a great meal in the chicken.  Whether it was a booth or a larger table they had to put together, it was done with ease by the staff."}
{"text":"Wow, what a terrible experience! The shrimp scampi was so acidic that it burned the inside of my mouth and tasted like mostly lemon. It was inedible. We had to wait over 20 minutes before we were even offered or brought a glass of water let alone any other beverages. The service was terrible and the server kept saying that the tip wasn't included so not to forget to tip the waiters. How Rude! A tip is for good service and we didn't have that! It was so noisy inside that we could barely talk to one another and were nearly yelling to be heard by each other. Even after we complained about the bad food and the service nothing was done. They will never get my business again."}
{"text":"I have nothing but glowing things to say about Charleston's in general, but specifically the Ray location. We have dined here at least 30 times and it's always consistent, always good food, and great service.   We have our go to entrees, we always start with shrimp cargot and a basket of croissants (soooo good) and then we get the ribs! The ribs are fall off the bone every time. I would truly say the best ribs I've ever had. Finish that off with the bread pudding and you can die happy. Thank me later"}
{"text":"Love to come here, this place is one of my favorite restaurants. Best place to come in the hot summer, because it's dark and cool inside, and the cold drinks are delightful.  Food here is always good - I recommend the amazing artichoke dip and chips. So yummy. The salads are all good, and I personally love the chicken ciabatta sandwich. Mmm! The only thing I dislike, is that the booths are tight - thin, small folk surely have no problem with this, but I particularly care to eat in, as I don't like feeling squished. But, hey, takeout is still awesome."}
