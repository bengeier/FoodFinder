{"text":"You know that feeling when you find a really comfortable place?  Alesci's is that kind of place.  It's not much to look at and there's hardly any place to sit.  But their sandwiches are out of this world.  True Italian deli.  The Italian roast beef sandwich is drip-from-your-chin good.  Their pizza is rustic and nothing but flavor.  It's a family place, and they love to treat their customers as family -- making sure they go away with a satisfied stomach, filled with comfortable, good tasting, hearty food."}
{"text":"This is my number one favorite place in solon. its a kind of cute little deli, but they really know what they're doing. I always get a sandwich, but it is very authentic! Also they have a nice bakery. The sandwich i get is very inexpensive but high quality."}
{"text":"Delicious 
Amazing white lasagna 
Haven't had anything else yet,  but I definitely will."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in the area!!! The food is always fresh and excellent!!! The owners and staff make you feel like you just walked in your own home!!!! I recommend everything that they have to offer!!!!!"}
{"text":"Legit. Small town feel. Great shop and awesome subs! I wanted to eat everything in here but my turkey sub with salami was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love it!  We had a golf outing catered by them and it was fantastic.   I was a big fan of the subs.  The key to a good sub is the roll.  It has to have a firm crust, but a soft inside and these were right on the money.

We also had chicken parm, and ziti.  Both were really good...although I do have to say I was a few beers down when I finally hit the ziti."}
{"text":"My mother bought literally the best Cassata cake I have ever eaten in my whole entire life from here for my reception. and the pastry's are so rich and delicious! Next time I am in Ohio i will be getting another cake for sure."}
{"text":"Love the fact that i can buy a great dessert, sandwich, and a case of soda at the same place. It's like a grocery store, restaurant, and gas station store all in one place. It's cool"}
{"text":"If you are ever in the Solon area you must try this place out. Everything is fresh and the food is just fantastic. Jim Alesci's Place is an amazing Italian deli.  You walk in and immediately you know you are going to get some great food.  Absolutely love the sandwiches.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We love this place.....the family and the food!
The smell of the bread alone is worth the drive. 
The meats and cheeses are always fresh and delicious. 
I'm partial to the Old Fashion pizza....cannot even imagine how many sheets we have ordered over the years. 
So happy we have them in Solon....and what a great new sop!"}
{"text":"Pizza is 5 stars - plenty of sauce and just enough cheese.  Perfect!  And only $2/slice.

The muffaletta was more like 2 stars.  Not bad, but I should have known it wouldn't be  a good one when he said \"I'll have to make that for you, so it will be just a few minutes.\"  

The service was exceptionally friendly and pleasant.  I was there about noon on a weekday, and didn't have to wait at all.  The bakery items looked great.  They might want to dust off all the bottles of wine and olive oil though.  A thick layer of dust is always a turn off when shopping for grocery items."}
{"text":"First visit and I was impressed.  The Big Guido sandwich was hearty and filling.  The self serve salad bar was just right.  I was greeted by the proprietor Debbie as I came in,  she directed me on how to order.  The whole process was smooth.  Lastly,  Debbie invited me to come by the next time I was in the area.  I will surely look up Jim Alesci's place next time."}
{"text":"Good bread on sandwiches.  But I was a little salty when I asked for a sandwich without tomato and the woman reached for a pre-made sandwich, removed the tomato, and handed it to me.  Had I not been there with another person I would have made a federal case out of her doing that.  Mac and cheese is pretty good.  Aside from the deli there is a nice selection of Italian foods.  If I don't want take the drive to Gallucci's this place fits the bill...only they don't sell pizza dough."}
{"text":"delicious. 

while i've not yet been to the store in person, a birthday party we were at on Saturday afternoon was catered bu Jim Alesci's Place and it was downright yummy. 

we had the Italian beef, pasta salad and the most incredibly lemon chicken I've ever tasted. i kid you not, I could eat that every day. it was so, so good. 

Danielle and i are gonna stop in the next time we're out that way. I gotta try some more."}
{"text":"Get pizza, sandwich, salad for lunch. If you want the bakery, deli, or anything else... You will pay a premium price for it. Seriously. It's not that good to charge $16/lbs for sandwich pepperoni. The little Easter cookies my Grandma use to make. They were charging $10 for 6 cookies. A dozen set you back $20. That's crazy. I can make 20 dozen for $20 if I want to.... Have a quick lunch. Leave the rest for people who don't know how much stuff cost."}
{"text":"I ordered a cookie tray last week. It was delivered on time. I am told the cookies were delicious and were gone in a flash!
I will definitely order from here again!!!"}
{"text":"I recently used Alesci's for catering. We ordered subs sandwiches and salad for 70 people. Ethan worked with me to get the amounts right. We offered assorted meat subs and vegetarian subs as well. The caprese subs were the first tray to be finished off! They gave us plenty of condiments and even extra dressing for the caprese subs. 

They delivered the food to me on time. Their team works seamlessly to deliver what is ordered at the right time. I was very happy with my order and relieved that we were able to satisfy 70 hungry people!"}
{"text":"My favorite stop while heading to Cleveland.
Great Subs,Pizza,and Specialty items.
Be early at lunch time as they get packed."}
{"text":"This local institution has been baking quality goods and preparing fresh dishes for years and continues to set a standard as a deli/bakery specializing in authentic Italian fare!  Whether you're in the mood for a cannoli, craving a deli sandwich, or simply need spaghetti to take home, Alesci's has what you want and will NEVER disappoint."}
{"text":"Best of the best, tradition (personified) of the classic family Italian Deli. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The fresh pizza dough is the best we've ever found, along with the pizza cheese mix.  Also, we buy their pizza sauce.  It makes for a delicious pizza. 
I've always enjoyed their fresh homemade bread (simply the best), subs, lunch meat, and hot prepared meals.  
Now, their bakery is much improved.  So many choices. Yum."}
{"text":"Beautiful bakery. Brought some Parmesan chicken bake home and it was delicious. The sandwiches looked amazing and I was surprised by the low prices! The staff was also so helpful and kind. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Okay Ferrara's, you have to step aside. Alesci's is now my favorite Italian Sub in Cleveland. The bread is the biggest differentiator in this game. Do yourself a favor and hit up Alesci's for a great Italian Deli experience. They have an extensive selection of sandwiches, hot food, a bakery that rocks it, and a decent wine selection."}
{"text":"Best Italian food on the east side for lunch.  Their famous \"big guido\" 'sub has got all the meats, their muffellata rivals what I've had in New Orleans, and their house vinnagarrete goes well on either.

Chicken parm is a slam dunk and can be done as a sub or plate with pasta.  Their pizza is nothing to sneeze at either, and get their pepperoni bread it hits the spot with a little red sauce to dip it in.

Sausage and peppers are good as well, and don't forget they have a fresh bakery inside for some of the best Italian bread and desserts you can find.

The icing on the top is how good and quick the service is, especially with a lunch rush!"}
{"text":"I eat grab lunch from here a couple times a week.  The sandwiches are great, the pizza is good warm or cold.  It's clearly not 5 star dining, but it gets a 5 star rating for grab-and-go lunch."}
{"text":"Frequent lunch stop for me when working in the area.  Coming from an Italian, this is some high quality home cooked food with fresh ingredients served by friendly people.  They have daily specials, soup and salad, and a small grocery section full of goodies as well.  I intentionally stay away from the bakery because quite frankly I'm already full enough after I eat whatever I end up deciding on that day.  But it all looks so delicious!"}
{"text":"A long over due visit, and have to saw we plan on becoming frequent customers. We sampled the Big Guido sub, a few canolis, pepperoni bread and sauce and the anti pasta salad. All were AMAZING! The people there are extremely helpful and will talk about how everything is fresh and help with any questions you might have. They will be moving into a new location late Sept/early Oct right around the corner. We cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great sandwhices and wedding soup was great.  Fast tasty lunch spot!  Bakery is out of this world flavorful love the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"I stopped in one day for a sandwich. It was good - roast beef the way I like it, nice amount of juice, good bread. The sandwiches are pre-made and in a display case. This is the kind of place where if you're not careful, you will blink and miss it. Or you will be drawn into a super long conversation with the cashier on your lunch break, that will be suprising pleasant. Or you will be hit on by old italian guys. A good time for all.

On a side note, there is also alot of deli items, hot and cold, italian pastas and other items which look neat, a bit pricey (root beer bbq sauce). Definitely will have to check it out another time."}
{"text":"Great place for a deli sandwich. The cookies are also outstanding and the variety changes daily."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my original review because this place is even better than before thanks to all these new additions:

Natural Soda Bar
Coffee Bar
Loose Leaf Tea Experience
Breakfast (from 7:30 - 10am)

And best of all, homemade gelato!!"}
{"text":"- Hot food: They serve sandwiches using the sesame bread they bake on site. It's crunchy and fragrant. You can call ahead to order a pizza, and they'll bake it for you to pick up. During the week they have daily pasta specials.

- Bakery: Their bakery serves delightful little sweets and desserts. We were there when the store is closing up, and they throw away whatever is left over in the glass case.

- Gelateria: Recently they started serving gelato. My Italian folks told me to judge a gelateria by the color of the pistachio flavor. If it's neon green, walk away. That's not the natural color of pistachio. As you can see from my photo, it is very pale, hardly green. And you can see whole pistachio in the gelato. It may not be rich and creamy like Jeni's, but you know they use real ingredients, and try to keep a fresh inventory."}
{"text":"Had a Big Guido a few weeks ago and it was great. Then, last week, we were at a local business meeting and they had lasagna and salad brought over from here. Pretty amazing, I must say. Great cookies! Lining up on some pizza dough from here soon."}
{"text":"I've lived in Northeast Ohio my entire life. My family has used Alesci's catering for as long as I can remember, and it's always been delicious. So imagine my shock when I discovered how incredible this place is and how stupid I felt for never stopping inside in-person. While we'll always continue to do catering, I'm making visits here more regularly.

My brain kind of goes into overload when I think about describing Alesci's. It's part bakery, grocer, coffee bar, prepared foods, and wine shop. They moved into this new-ish location somewhat(?) recently, and it's impressive. When you walk in, you don't feel like you're in Solon. It's so great, you imagine that you surely must be in Cleveland or Little Italy. It instantly became a new favorite place. Everything was wonderful-- the Italian groceries, the gorgeous cheese selection, colorful olive bar, the delicious-looking prepared foods bar...I could go on and on. But a highlight is surely the bakery. The items are DROOL worthy.

For lunch, I ordered the daily special (cavatelli and meatballs) from the prepared foods bar. Oh my god. So. Delicious. I also picked up a pepperoni bread, a few drinks, a few cannolis, and a piece of cassata cake... all for nearly $20. This might not sound like a big deal, but when I consider what this all would've cost me in CLE, it would likely be double. I'm coming here way more often, whether for just picking up lunch or grabbing bakery/appetizers for a party. The suburbs are so lucky to have them as a local institution!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch thanks to yelp reviews. Ate my way around the store since I had time to kill. Started with a roast beef sub - it was ok, nothing special. I had the cold one, not the hot, juicy \"Italian Beef\" version that I should have had. 2 out of 5 stars. For my money I'd rather get a sub at DiBella's.

Then I found the WINNER!!! The \"old fashion\" pizza. Thick, square cut pizza with no cheese and a nice thick layer of delicious sauce on top. SO good I went back the same week for another slice. I'll surely be stopping here for a slice every time I'm in the area. 6 out of 5 stars!

For dessert: a cannoli of course! I haven't had a lot of cannoli's so I can't really say how good this was in relative terms. Not sweet enough to satisfy me for a dessert though. 2 out of 5 stars.

I also bought a bottle of their homemade Root Beer but I haven't had it yet."}
{"text":"I went for the Big Guido sub with dressing.  All I can say is... Wow! The bread was super fresh and little crispy on the outside. The combination of meats was delicious and ample. I also tried a square slice of sausage pizza.  I should have ordered two slices.

There are some good things happening here at Jim Alesci's.  I stopped in and saw a nice spread of fresh foods for choosing.  There are a variety of sandwiches and pizza to select.  I also saw trays of pasta, lasagna, sausage and peppers.  There's a bakery side and a grocery side too!  Pick up your can of olive oil, cannolis and sub in one stop. The staff was super nice and talked about their other types of pizza.  I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the spot for everything you need for an Italian feast! Everyone treats you like you're part of the family at Jim Alesci's Place. 

Jim Alesci's Place has a relatively new larger location next to the Solon Police Station, with a larger café area to gather with friends for a quick bite to eat. As you walk inside, you are greeted to a large prepared foods case. With hot foods such as italian sausage, pizza,lasagna, and raviolli. Or cold foods such as eggplant rollups, stuffed cabbage, homemade potato salad or macaroni salad.  Enjoy a fresh gigantic hoagie of your liking for less than $8! Their hoagie rolls are perfect for any sandwich you can fill in them. 

While grabbing some cold cuts and macaroni salad to enjoy at home, we discovered the gelato counter. We sampled several flavors before deciding on Cheesecake and Lemon Sorbet. Their gelato is so creamy and melts in your mouth like heaven! The bakery associate packed our gelato in a styrofoam to-go countainer that holds 2 scoops for $11.99."}
{"text":"The best bakery in town & especially if you want authentic Italian Foods & spices. This place has been my favorite since I moved to Solon in 1998"}
{"text":"Garbage. Deli food is rancid, horrid service. Just go to Giant Eagle- why pay extra for this junk"}
{"text":"My first visit and I was happy with it. When I knew I was going to be in Solon, I decided to try this place for lunch. 

I first stopped at the hot foods counter. The woman was super friendly and helpful. I tried the special of the day which was ravioli - beef or cheese and she let me mix and match them so I got 5 of each, 10 total. She asked me if I wanted extra sauce and Romano cheese. I agreed to both! 

Next, I went to the bakery where I got a piece of tiramisu. 

I went to check out and the cashier was super friendly and sweet. I ended up deciding to eat in, in a small dining area. They had utensils, condiments, etc. available.

My ravioli were really good as was the sauce, but especially the cheese. A little salty with great flavor. The portion was large and I couldn't finish it. It also came with 2 pieces of garlic bread. 

The tiramisu was different sort of thick and dry, but not dry meaning over cooked."}
{"text":"Really great Italian takeaway. Best bakery Italian bread is the best. I love everything about this place. 
Best lunch around."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Alesci's downtown for lunch. I was glad that there is a store in Solon where I can grab some quick food on lunch at the new job. The food is good. I don't really like the red sauce. The daily lunch special is a great deal for $6. It usually consists of a chicken or meat dish, two sides and garlic bread. There are plenty of Italian foods and things available for purchase. I think this place is great for the price."}
