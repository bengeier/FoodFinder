{"text":"I used to love this place, moved away for a couple years and returned for the novelty the other day. The experience I had left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Walked in an hour - 45mins before closing and was told we weren't allowed to sit and eat for no reason other than they wanted to close to go home early, I suppose they didn't expect anymore customers to come in? I'm not sure but you could tell they didn't care to be there by the quality of the food they prepared and the service.

My main complaint is the fact the beef udon I ordered was so oily and sloppy thrown together I ended up throwing it out without eating it, not to mention it was cold because I had to walk home with the take-out i hadn't intended on ordering when leaving, all because the owners wanted to get home earlier.

I am sincerely disappointed. Somewhere along the way in the last two years Little Tokyo fell off hard.

Some reasons I won't return:

- Their miso has no tofu or kelp and is more or less pure broth.

- My steamed rice was horrendously overcooked 

- Unfriendly service didn't make anything better"}
{"text":"Delish! I come here a least once a month and get the beef yakisoba. Hits the spot for some greasy South East Asian cuisine. 
The folks that work here are always super friendly and fast too! 
Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Cheap Korean and Japanese food. I had take out. I would stay away from the sushi, there are better options in the area. The bibimbap was ok but don't think I would eat it again. Its a decent alternative if you want a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Can't beat places like this.  Small Japanese Korean menu.  Delicious cheap fast friendly.  They do it right."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat.  The service is always very friendly, and there is never a long wait for the food.  I always get the chicken yakisoba, the portion size is large, and enough for more than a full meal, while the food itself always taste great.  It also comes with sides of rice and salad which give you extra variety with your meal."}
{"text":"Had no idea what yakisoba was so I dropped by Little Tokyo Fast Food to find out.

I ordered the chicken yakisoba to go @ $10. It comes with rice, salad and chicken with terriyaki sauce on a bed of thin udon noodles. It was delicious!

The salad had a nice light ginger sauce that was very pleasant. I wish there was more. Next time I might ask for 2 salads and no rice. 

The main dish was flavourful, the meat was well done and the noodles were el dente too!

Next time I would get spicy instead of medium. When I went there at 2pm they had take out only. So be aware of that.

Yes they do serve beer too at $4.5 for a bottle of domestic and $5.5 for a bottle of Japanese beer."}
{"text":"Been here many times the past year and a bit.  Whenever I'm in the area I will come by for lunch.  I've dined in and have had take out often.  Sometimes the teriyaki dishes are a bit greasy, but their flavors and textures are amazing.  They not only have just rice, they add fried noodles, and vegetables.  The bibimbap is so good too.  Amazing owners and level of service every time."}
{"text":"Simple,  fast,  delicious,  and LLBO! Run by a nice Asian couple. Ordered the chicken yakisoba.  It came with rice on the side for some reason,  though it wasn't unwelcome! The smidgen of salad was also appreciated to balance the dish.  The owner brought my dish to me with a bottle LG sriracha which I took as a cue to apply liberally.  The spice level of \"spicy\" was a nice bit of heat,  but I can definitely handle more.  Noticed they serve bottled beer here!  Domestics and Sapporo.  Would pair nicely.  Seating is mostly tables of four.  Pretty empty though - seems like take out is what most people come here for.  

I will come again."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but I get takeout a least 3 -5 times per month.  Mostly we get bimbimbop.  The service here is friendly, and they prepare the food relatively quickly.  We never call ahead for our orders.  The place itself looks small and dark.  Whenever I stop by around 8pm it is always empty.  I think they make most of their money through takeout orders.  I would recommend stopping by this place, but I honestly haven't tried their sushi.

{"text":"FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKY

Its always a happy ending when you eat out at Little Tokyo!!!

This place is friggin amazing. It looks a little ghetto from the outside, but hot-damn, do they make some mean dishes. Their Beef yakisoba is amazing. I've never eaten in before, I always get it to go, but the service is fast, friendly, and you'll be hard-pressed to find ANY food this filling and this tasty for less than $10. Definatly worth checking out if youve never been. I only wish they were open a little later in the evening some times. 

Put this place on your bucket-list folks.."}
