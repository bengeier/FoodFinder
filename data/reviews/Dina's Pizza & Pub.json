{"text":"Ordered wings to go. Got them home in under 5 minutes. Wings were undercooked, soggy, and had no flavor. Truly terrible wings. I don't know how they won the Plain Dealer contest."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad meal here. Prices are very reasonable and they make good pizza and wings. I always bring friends here when they are in town!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but not worth the prices. Wings were good but pizza was flat. I used a credit card and they charged me a fee. Not a bad place to go after work but is a little pricey compared to other bars."}
{"text":"I've made a couple return trips to Dina's, and it's become one of my favorites. The pizza and wings are just incredible: always delicious, never disappointing. There are some weird specialty pizzas (seafood, taco... pierogi?) and they're actually worthwhile! But the classic pepperoni is great too. The \"house mild\" wings are more savory and sweet than your usual crappy vinegar-and-cayenne sauce, definitely worth a try. Protip: Order your wings extra-crispy, especially if they're going to sit in sauce for more than a few minutes.  Service has always been very good. My last server gladly brought me a cold mug for my beer, others gave extra napkins or whatever else was needed. And they'll chat and joke with you if they're not too busy.  I recently discovered they allow parking in a lot across the street so that complaint is gone. Now the only possible issue is that they could run out of seats in the busiest hours."}
{"text":"Love it .... Stromboli is awesome !!! Pizzas are pretty good ... Wings are crispy and I love the Hot barbecue sauce .. Just enough spice !!!   Very family friendly but yet a great bar with nightlife !!! Pizzas available till closing ... Gotta love it !!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great pizza. And thebaward winning wings...well speechless! I would have gave it 5 stars but parking is a tetris game!"}
{"text":"Dina's Pizza & Pub has fallen off a cliff in the last couple years.  Their regular food menu was never that good, but it's a pizza place. Their pizza used to be great. Not anymore. This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. Bordering on offensive. Way to much sauce on a dough that didn't even rise. It was still doughy and mushy throughout. I didn't even take it home with me.  The draft beer tasted off. Just a basic light american lager that tasted a mixture of dirty, flat, and cigarettes.  I noticed a Cleveland Police officer there, not for leisure, but for security purposes. I didn't feel like something bad was going to happen to me there, but the entire time I did have to keep some type of guard up because their clientele is somewhat ghetto.   What a waste of a decent place. I won't be going back and I don't recommend you waste your time or money here either."}
{"text":"My go to for when I want to get reasonably buzzed and smash some hot wings. Parking can be a pain; park in the car lot across the street by 58th. Atmosphere is loud, as there's usually a dj on Fridays and Saturdays, where it turns into more bar than restaurant. Their wings are great! My favorites: house hot (spicy yet sweet from honey), 911 (very hot!), garlic parmesan, honey mustard, and dry caribbean. Every pizza I've had has been excellent, but my favorites are the taco pizza, spinach bianca, and especially hot artichoke.   Waitresses are always really nice, there's never a long wait, and their beer selection isn't too shabby. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some great wings and pizza, but that being said, I've stolen bites of calzones and subs and everything has been excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, very friendly staff.   You have to try the Tommy Burger. Hmm hmm good!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love love love getting their food! The buffalo chicken pizza is addicting and the garlic parm wings were my favorite! I'm not sure if its my own food intolerance or maybe they got a new cook but the last few times I ate here it upset my stomach.  I still dont hold it against them, the food is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Angelo: I went in and ordered a simple take out order. I also ordered a beer.......tgen another. My wife was waiting for a while. So she started to call me wondering where I am and what's taking me so long.i sat another 1/2 hour......(total of an hour). 4 or 5 people came in after me and they got thete order and 2 had it eaten and was leaving. Very disappointing, my wife and I go thete 2 or 3 times a week. Nobody offered an explanation. I wanted to pay for my beers and leave and forget the meal. Then I came home and the food was cold. I didn't call to complain we just wont go thete again. It's not truely a full service restaurant but only a local bar with sub average bar food. Very unorganized kitchen and inconsistant food preparation. A shame it could be a good place with proper experienced management. Both in the kitchen and the front of the house. There a was nothing offered for our inconvinience."}
{"text":"The thing I like most about Dina's is that it is a very CLEAN establishment which is very important to me. I love their pizza and wings (I swear they are the only bar that understands what crispy means). But I'm not too crazy about their sandwiches, fries, etc. Definitely a good place to get some drinks and bar food or get it delivered to you if you aren't too far. But they are getting a little expensive in my opinion. But that won't stop me from getting their pizza and wings! :)"}
{"text":"I have yet to try the rest of the menu as far as the pizza and wings go, but I will say the meatballs are fantastic. For whatever reason I decided to stop in at 130 for lunch after class. Planned to have one drink and wait to take a pizza home, but, I wanted more to drink. So I stayed a bit and noticed they had meatball sub and fries on special for $5. Good choice!  I sat at the bar, Shaina was great - nice, prompt, and attentive. The only issue I had with the visit was my second beer. Got a miller lite draft the first time and that tasted fine. Second time around I wanted a bud light, and I drink it and just get this odd vinegar like taste to it. Sat there and processed it, confused. Smelled it..yeah, smells like vinegar. Weirdest thing ever, had plenty of draft beers in my time and am familiar with a bud light taste, but this was different. It was really off-putting, and I couldn't help but bring to someones attention. An issue wasn't made out of it and I was offered another to makeup for it, so I went back with the miller. Not sure whatever became of that, but I give shaina respect for the profuse apologies and just great service.  I like the inside and sitting at the bar. It just feel right. Have had the pasta dinners in the pasta always liked the meatballs. Not gonna let a little weird beer taste (that was fixed with a different one) be the basis of not coming back. Definitely plan on coming back to try other things. More so that for 2 drafts and a lunch special I paid 8$ for. I say OK. Stay tuned.."}
{"text":"Wow! The food is great here. They deliver to my work and I can only say great things about this place! I like that the minimum delivery is only $5."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to get pizza and wings in the area. The service is great, the wings are huge & flavorful, and the pizza is perfect!"}
{"text":"Always on the look out for good pizza, and hearing some good things about this place, obviously I had to try check it out.  I have eaten here several times, and have tried the pepperoni pizza, bbq chicken pizza, Parmesan chicken sandwich and several of their salads.  I am not very impressed with the pepperoni pizza, while it has good enough flavor, it just doesn't hold up to the \"can I hold it with one hand to eat it\" test.  I think maybe it's because the pepperonis cause the crust to be too greasy.  I really liked the bbq chicken pizza and it is now our go to pizza when ordering from there. It tastes really good, with the sweet tang of bbq sauce.  It's also really good cold the next day.  Their salads have been okay, as long as you eat them the same day. I had ordered a chicken salad for lunch the following day and when I went to eat it, the lettuce had been all wilted, maybe because the chicken was warm when they put it on, but the salad was barely edible. Also the chicken is not exactly fresh grilled chicken, it tastes more like the prepackaged kind. But I'm not all that surprised and it still tastes fine."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had in Cleveland! Wings were outstanding. Gillian our waitress was AMAZING! Please, take control of the music was the only negative!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and JOJOS...the other day and sad to say, i never will again..after a 2 hour  wait I called to see what was up, well the phone lady said I never ordered from them..well, i was shocked, so i pulled up my bank account and guess what...the money was accepted...well, after 10 minutes she never said she did..and said, well..if i did it is on its way..so 1/2 hour later it shows up..the delivery guy said,,yeah we are busy..well great for you...so, the burger melt was fried at least 6 times and microwaved 4 more time...it was the soggiest rubbery...cold piece of poop on a bun!...and the jojos..well..imagine a microwaved bike tire..yep..that bad..so...lying employees, bad cooks...means...BUYER BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Used to patronize them quite a bit but after numerous screw ups, take my business elsewhere. Have had simple pizza orders screwed up and cold food delivered."}
{"text":"Pierogi Pizza!  The most amazing pizza you will eat! I love pretty much all their pizzas as I always vote on them for best of Cleveland surveys but the Pierogi one takes the grand prize of amazingness!  Dina's is in my opinion the best place to eat in Brooklyn. The wait staff is so nice and it's definitely a townie hot spot but with cheap drinks, great pizza and wings who wouldn't love to have a place like this in their neighborhood?!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple; if you like great wings, then Dina's is your place.  They were voted best wings and deservedly so.  The Cajun and Caribbean rubbed wings are addictive.  If wings aren't your thing, then try one of their many pizzas, you won't be disappointed.  We usually get our orders to go, but if you choose to eat inside you'll feel right at home in this cozy, neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"A must visit for everyone.  Everything on the very large menu (feel terrible for the chef!) seems delicious.  If you're craving pizza and wings then get here asap!  One of the few places in Cleveland that has quality buffalo wings.  Although the sauces are not very hot, even the hottest is mild.  Service is average."}
{"text":"The pizza sauce has no taste.. the crust was too hard. I wasn't a fan of this place. The atmosphere is really awesome but the food just wasn't. I also ordered a fried veggie basket specifically for the cauliflower and it wasn't even in the basket... That irritated me and then I had to wait for an order of them."}
{"text":"Have eaten in the restaurant and had delivery all the time.  Basic bar food with basic taste and quality.  The pizza use to be very good, but the past 2 months they have been so bad I won't order there any more.  I think they changed to a cheaper sauce"}
{"text":"Dina's pizza my first couple times was really good but a couple times after that, it was just ok....... Their wings are amazing,... They have quick delivery service and the foods is still fresh when it gets to your door. If you done in, the food is always better (of course).... They service I wouldn't say is quick but it's not terribly slow either.... U have to try the dry rub wings."}
{"text":"I want to apologize to the server for bothering her by patronizing this place please excuse me for interrupting your free time to text"}
{"text":"I like the food here, but I always do carry out because the service isn't all that great. Once I had a Long Island and at the bottom was something bright red, like a piece of cherry or something. So I got it out and realized it was broken glass! I asked the bartender if I could have a new drink due to the glass. She replied, \"yeah I saw that in there but thought you put it in there. How did I put it in there if YOU served me the drink with it in there? Anyway, food is great, service not so much."}
{"text":"This place is great. If a bar has a drive through window...they got some good food;)"}
{"text":"almost a 5 but it was cold outside and if you sat on one side it was near the drive thru so you got cold air every other 5 mins, near the front you could smell the smokers every time the front door opened.   Besides those 2 items the Pizza and wings are awesome.  Some of the best pizza in town and many different types of wings to order.  We brought home a mason jar of Hot Wing Sauce.   Note we went the week the temps were in the single digits.  If not for that 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am surprised that I haven't even written a review of this place, especially since I came here faithfully when living in C-town.   Was here again recently when business brought me back home.. and this time I met up with some old friends and brought some out of towners with me.    Came in on a weeknight, it wasn't too crowded, I was worried with it being March Madness and all... but was able to secure a much convented parking spot ( parking does really suck when it gets busy).   We put a few tables together where you first walk in and easily accommodated our party of 8.   Let's just say, this isn't where you go to compliment your diet or your healthy eating options... this is where you go for good times, cold beers, and yummy (sometimes fried ) food.   I always love the broccoli bites ( breaded and fried filled with broccoli and cheese) .. and who wouldn't enjoy tasty friend pepperoni with ranch sauce.  Their pizza is actually pretty good as well.   Everyone ate, drank, and had a good time.  The people I took there for the first time, liked the wings and pizza !!     Like I said, this is a bar, a hang out, nothing to fancy, just real, down to earth people trying to get their grease one, watch some games, and enjoy each others' company.   Thank god there is a gym at the hotel!"}
{"text":"Overall this is a great neighborhood bar!! Ive been coming here for 2 years and its the one place i can't wait to come back to. Nothing to complain about but i wish they had a bigger dinas lol. Awesome place to watch any cleveland sports! Have 2.50$ for all cleveland sports games. Just wish they had better food speicals for games. This place is always packed for the food. They have banquet room and its always packed on friday and saturday. The wings come in all kinds of flavors. Personally i love their house mild. The salads are bigger than the average human head and well worth the money!! I also enjoy thier chicken quesadilla. So cheap but filled with tons of stuff like black olives tomatoes and of course chicken and cheese plus much more. Its so big it comes in a large to go box if u get it togo lol. They have an awesome taco Thursday's . Huge !!! pizzas for 10.50 on Wednesday. They serve pizza and calzones till 2:00AM which is awesone. Drinks i usually just get my beer but if you happen to met the lovely bartender PEGGY make sure you try her famous carnival water shot. Youll quickly learn its a regular shot always made there if pegs working. Tons of tables, bar seats, and patio. Lots of tvs so any game that is happening you'll see anywhere you sit plus 3 more games lol. Never had a bad experience. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Dina's many times in the past few years. Normally the service is decent as well as the food. However, my friend and I went into Dina's on Wednesday to order a cheese pizza. We were both starving and it seemed like it took a lot of time to make our food. I am not sure as far as what the to go orders were, but there was not many people in the place. So the time management problem set the night up for unhappy customers. A waitress( not our waitress) brings over our two cheese pizzzas. My friend questions the waitress because the pizzas were burnt to a crisp. My friend joked after we left that they were cripsy cheese critters. The watiress seemed annoyed when my friend asked questions regarding if the pizza was suppose to look like that. The waitress( assuming) because were not her table could have cared less- she stated that if we don't like the pizza then she will take them back and walked away. She also said the pizza was suppose to look like that.  My friend who like I said earlier- were beyond starved! We did not complain but we will not be back to Dina's for awhile. Five dollars was even too much to pay for this pizza.   The service good though!"}
{"text":"Watched the Cavs game here last night, had a great experience. Incredibly nice servers, the people and atmosphere were pleasant and the highlight was the wings! I had the house sauce and Cajun. Kind of wished I got the hot house sauce, but will try that next time. The wings were perfectly cooked and seasoned, very impressed. I highly recommend this place and will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is riding the 3-4 star line.  The pizza is great, the atmosphere is terrible, but in a good way.  The waitress was awesome.  Currently I'm trying to figure out what I'd tell the owner to improve and I can't think of much, I'm pretty sure this place is exactly what they want it to be, that's why it's good shit."}
{"text":"One of my go-to bars if I'm in the area. Great food, drinks, and service. The atmosphere is awesome. This place is almost, always packed. People still come though. Parking can be a pain as they do have a small parking lot, but there is another lot across the street and even street parking available.  Drinks are super cheap and so is the food. They offer a wide variety of food, but their pizzas are a must! Make sure to try out their wings as well.  I don't think I've ever had to wait long for my drinks or food. The service is amazing. A place that offers great food and drinks for low prices, what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Who's in the kitchen with Dina??? ( okay so that didn't rhyme but whatever you laughed)...Finally got around to going to Dinas pizza after 2 years of passing it every single day on my way to work.  I went during lunch, which was my mistake  but I was actually able to find parking. After celebrating my spot I was informed they had additional parking across the street and I wasn't as special as I originally thought (whomp!)  Inside I found a cute little local spot, great sports bar atmosphere. Darker than usual inside, but overall it was cool. They have lots of wall memorabilia from local sports teams to major league and actors. They have lottery and some video games way in the back by the take out counter.  Their menu was packed full of options, from appetizers to salads, wraps, burgers, pizza....awesome selections!  I remained calm and got the classic wings and a buffalo chicken wrap to start my dinas journey.   The wings were AWESOME, crispy and hot, perfectly tossed in their hot BBQ sauce served with blue cheese. I got a 5 piece I should definitely have gotten more.  The buffalo chicken wrap was the real star of this visit. The chicken was fried to perfection, served with lettuce and tomato, onions and blue cheese. It was super fresh and yummy.   The wait staff at the take out counter was a little slow, but I also think they were overwhelmed with how many people were ordering. They kept apologizing for the delay which was nice to hear, and even offered some soda( or pop as y'all call it) free of charge.   Overall I had a great experience foodwise here, I will definitely be back to try their pizza and more! Way to go Dina!!"}
{"text":"Last two visits to Dina's has been less than perfect.   Poor service and food quality diminished.   Also, in there on Thursday evening and loud music on juke Box playing rap music.  Just seems to be changing and not for better.  Waitress took over 20 minutes for drinks and had a bad attitude.   Some of the crowd she is bring in is not good and hopefully she will recognize and make corrections with staff."}
{"text":"My family has always loved Dina's! Great food all around, and great service. I especially love their Stromboli it's my go to anytime I eat or order here."}
{"text":"Great food - new menu as of January 2012. Dina's has everything from appetizers (awesome wings, many flavors) to specialty pizzas (try the buffalo chicken or the baked potato pizzas) Stromboli is the best I've ever had. Great place with lots of energy!  Update - Dina's recently won The Plain Dealer \"Wing Playoffs\" beating out over a hundred local establishments to take top prize!"}
{"text":"Went their yesterday in town for wedding heard the food was good wanted to see for myself. Was not disappointed I enjoyed the wings and pizza and do plan to return on my next visit ."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings. Beats the more common chain pizza places. Their pizza of the month is usually worth a try. I love spicy wings, but I always get two orders here: whatever spicy sauce I want, then their mild. It's the best sweet mild sauce I've ever had! Get more on the side to dip your crust or fries in. Boom."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. Definitely a bar, but they have an extensive food menu. Very popular local place so it gets crowded quickly and you'll have to park on the street if it's around happy hour. Guys, they have a drive up window for your take out! Awesome, but when it's super crowded can be difficult to navigate that parking lot. I'd comeback again with coworkers for a drink and food!   Drinks-they have a good amount of drink choices. My beer of the month was flat and she replaced it with something else no problem. She also said she would have them check it. I saw them changing the c02 out within 5 minutes. I love that, she heard a customer complaint and fixed a problem!   Food-SO impressed with my salad. I asked her to be honest about the quality or if I should get pizza, burger, etc. She pushed the salad and I wasn't disappointed! Except for the grilled chicken, not great-kinda like microwave style with fake grill marks lol Would get it without chicken next time. The wings-very DELISH!"}
{"text":"Dina's is okay. Not the best, but not the worst. If you're in Old Brooklyn and want pizza, Dina's isn't a bad choice. I will say there is one thing that brings me back. Ranch Fries! They're super simple, just fries, ranch, and cheese but man are they good! In fact, I have a couple of friends that, whenever they come over, beg me to order ranch fries so I would definitely say they are a winner!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pizza and wings every Friday night! The service is good and the food is AMAZING!!! I have never eaten inside-only take out, but it has never let me down!"}
{"text":"This is bar food, people.  Best wings in Cleveland?  I don't think so.  They are average to average plus but at $1/wing and an additional dollar for blue cheese and another dollar for celery that's $7 for 5 wings?  Who the hell do you think you are?  So yes, they are decent wings, but you can get the same at so many other places around town for much less (and the 5 and 10 instead of half dozen and dozen is just stupid).  It's a good bar but no different than so many others."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for a few years now, how they're wings are among the best in the city, how they've got some killer pizza, it was only a matter of time before we decided to give them a try for ourselves. Our experience was of the take-out variety so I can't speak to the actual restaurant and its service.  First, I've gotta mention the challenge we experienced just trying to place our order. I don't know the last time I tried to call a restaurant and received a busy signal. First attempt. Busy signal. Second attempt. Busy signal. Over and over and over. It took us nearly 10 attempts before we were able to place our order. I get it. You're busy. That's good. So how about investing in another line?  We decided to try several items on their rather extensive menu to really get the Dina's experience. I said extensive, right? We're talking over a dozen different salads, pizza (including 16 different specialty pies), burgers, wraps, stromboli, melts, sandwiches. It really is a crazy big menu for such a small, neighborhood spot.  The delivery guy was quite friendly and very professional. He arrived after about a 40 minute wait with credit card scanner in tow. Quick transaction. No complaints on the customer interface.  For us we kept it simple - Salad, wings, pizza.  The Old Brooklyn's Favorite salad was pretty tasty and plenty for two, possibly three people. Kudos for using spinach & spring mix instead of iceberg. Throw in some sugared pecans, dried cranberries, strawberries, cucumbers, tomatoes & croutons and you've got a hearty - and incredibly sweet - salad. The fat-free raspberry vinaigrette that came with it was so cloying that we tossed it and used some homemade balsamic instead.  OK, it's bot really fair to judge a place and their wings based on a take-out order because of the time between when they're produced and when they actually arrive. They won't nearly be as crispy as they are fresh from the kitchen. This was the case here. Our garlic parmesan wings were very tasty and the buttery sauce was flavorful and well-seasoned but the time in transit had rendered them nearly crunchless.  We went with a traditional pizza, pepperoni, mushroom, banana peppers. It was good. Dina's makes a solid pie that's pretty much in line with just about every other pizza joint in the neighborhood. A good crust, slightly sweet sauce and more cheese than expected, it made for a filling and satisfying meal. Our medium-sized pizza was plenty for two with enough for a second meal.  Our experience with takeout from Dina's was a good one, but with so many \"good\" options in the area I'm not sure how often they'll be worked into our rotation. Our journey through the Cleveland-area pizza and wing scene continues..."}
{"text":"Dina's is the place to go if you're looking for the simple things... like good service, affordable food, delicious drinks, cheap beer, the best wings in town, fun company, a small town feel, to watch the game that day, and a good feeling! Do yourself a favor on a weeknight and don't make dinner.. instead, head down to Dina's and let them take care of you and allow you to enjoy the evening!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, many toppings to choose from. Their wings were ok, I asked for them extra crispy and they weren't. When I told the waitress she said the chef said they were. I said I'm the one eating them and they are not. She took the plate back and 10 minutes later brought me 8 wings that were almost burnt and said that since I ate two of them already I was only getting 8..I think it was an off night because I never had it happen there since..."}
{"text":"If I lived closer, I'd catch Browns & Tribe games at this place on the regular. The kitchen (I'm told) closes when the bar does, the beer selection is quality, and it has a great Cleveland-working class vibe to it.  It's right where it needs to be in the middle of Brooklyn but it's not worth making the trip if you're staying downtown."}
{"text":"40 minutes for 1 chicken sandwich!! Service sucked. She was lazy & I assume she forgot to put my order in. Also, don't understand the hype w/ their pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good. I will definitely be ordering from them again. No complaints. I love the amount of sauce and cheese. The best pizza in Old Brooklyn by far."}
{"text":"Dina's pizza is great! From taco pizza to western burger, and house wrap, not to mention the best mild wing sauce anywhere! This place is kid friendly too! Great place to eat, drink, and have fun. Great Service too! Thanks for all the good times and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Tried Dina's pizza at a work function and was not disappointed. Will definitely be my go to place for the future. Would love to actually take a visit here and order some menu items and provide a better review."}
{"text":"Just got home from Dinas again and this place just ROCKS!!!  First of all its SO close!!! Secondly it has some of THE BEST pizza and wings in Cleveland!! Not to mention prices are very reasonable! Be prepared tho, place is ALWAYS busy but the turnover is pretty good or you can just belly up to the bar and dive right in!!! Old Brooklyn has some awesome other places to go and stay tuned as I venture out into the great Cleveland beyond to review more!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and the specials are great.  They have some chicken jalapeno pizza that is a must try.  I took the pic and posted about Jersey Shore night.  I believe that is all I need to say about that.  There are some interesting characters that I've seen in here, but that shouldn't stop you from trying the food.  The parking is pretty bad though.  The lot is tiny and you usually have to drive and park all the way up a side street.  If you park across the street you run the risk of being towed.  I'm not a smoker but they have a smoking tent out front."}
{"text":"I love it here. My favorite place to grab food. Garlic Parm wings are delicious. And the BLT wrap with ranch is my favorite!"}
{"text":"They got bomb pizzas here and strombolis as well.  Getting a drink while I wait for my order to go..."}
{"text":"Great place!! And the food is great too! Their pizza is a great value. The tall draft beers are like only two bucks. And now they have HD tv to watch. Parking a problem sometimes."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here at least once a week . The food is amazing. Great place to watch the game and have a great time."}
{"text":"I love dinas. Great wings, great salad and really good Stromboli and pizzas. If you like a garage style sports bar, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This was the endpoint for Critical Mass this past Friday.  I had never been in this place before.  It is pretty middle/working class in atmosphere and decoration.  Has a part of a classic Car mounted in the wall.  The food specials and drink specials are quite a good value and much cheaper than Ohio City or Tremont prices.  They have over 20 different kinds of pizzas, not to mention more typical bar fare(i.e wings, mushroom poppers, etc).  Friends of mine all split a 17 inch spicy/hot artichoke pizza and boy did that have some heat to it.  They have a decently impressive bottle selection and a pretty typical Cleveland tap setup(miller, coors, labatt, yuengling, one great lakes tap, magic hat, and one other) but their drink prices, like I said before are not hipster expensive like all those joints in OC.    This month's pizza of the month is Caramel Apple Pie pizza.  Yum.  One of the highlights of my time there was that the bartenders decided it would be a good idea to put cinnamon sugar on the rim and at the top of the beer like margaritas but great lakes style.  It made the Christmas Ale that much better.    Come check this out if you are not afraid of a good old neighborhood joint with a lotta food and beer."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! And food has gone down hill there was a hair in my food drink weren't refilled and my appetizer came out last?? Will never go back! Shittiest place on earth"}
{"text":"I've often got orders that weren't correct, get other tables tabs charged to my card so instead of a few beers on my card you get somebody's whole party on your card and have to wait for the refund. Today I visited and after the original greeting, Blondie with glasses, and older never came and took my order. She was walking around or talking to another worker. There was another couple that looked ready to cash out but weren't getting helped either. They were grumbling about that. I went across to burger king and got helped immediately. So much for pizza and a beer."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! You have to try the house mild & the dry rub six pepper. Kinda of pricey but well worth it. Wings are big & meaty. Pepperoni Crisp are the perfect appetizer. Soups are always great. Love the French Onion! Lots of choices for full meals or quick a little something. Service is good. Noise level is high at dinner time & the weekends. A great place to meet friends & have a few. Large patio for smokers."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick happy hour drink. Very nice environment,  when asking the locals they said some of the best pizza in town. They offer full menu and have restaurant seating and a large wrap around bar. Happy Hour drink prices were nice,  $5 for a large draft beer and a shot of whisky! Definitely can't wait to go back and try some of the tasty pizza"}
{"text":"Service a horribly slow but food is awesome! Always busy...but thats a good problem to have no?  Daily food specials make this place really affordable too.  Wish parking lot was bigger...lol"}
{"text":"I used to love Dina's. It was a chill place that my girlfriends and I could go, and not be drooled on by the scum of Brooklyn. Now, unfortunately, it has turned into every other bar on Memphis--distasteful and off-putting. The food quality has deteriorated, and so has the appeal and friendliness of the staff. (Peggy [bartender] is still awesome, of course.) The crowd has shifted from middle-class working people to trashy, low-class junkies. Sorry, Dina's, but ladies with a day job will be finding somewhere just a little classier to hang out."}
{"text":"I regularly order delivery and visit probably 4-5 times a month. They always get my food right, their drinks are priced moderately, and it's a fun environment. Definitely one of the better water holes in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this bar! The bartenders are friendly, the food is always good. We were serves quickly and had more than enough. The only negative side is the parking - there is limited parking spaces and you end up across the street or down a side street."}
{"text":"I have ordered their wings several times and asked for them to be \"well done\" cause I like crispy wings. They cannot seem to get it right. They are soggy and gross. They also have given me wings without sauce a couple times.  I love near by and order from them because it's convenient and they deliver. Their food isn't great and it's way overpriced. I will go to Buffalo Wild Wings, at least their wings are done correctly and as I ordered."}
{"text":"Ok, I know my reviews for Dina's are all over the place...BUT, they made some significant changes within the past couple of months and have really cleaned up their act, it would seem.  I've recently picked up quite a few orders here and the food has been really, really delicious. Among the things ordered have been the Cobb salad, Stromboli, breakfast burger and the wings.   The salads were much more plentiful than I remember, with fresh veggies (thank you!!!). The Stromboli was absolutely fantastic. I've honestly never had one before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but had an acquaintance say it was the best he'd ever had.   The wings though? The wings are what won me back over. Even when Dina's was still in my good graces previously, I never cared for their wings. I saw Chicken Parmesan wings on their menu and thought they sounded interesting enough to give them a whirl. Ho ho boy are these things out of this world. This combo is genius, I never would have thought to put spaghetti sauce and parm on wings but it works oh-so-well.  Dina's, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the Dinas Delight Pizza with chicken which was really good but they should season the chicken or the chopped tomatoes a little to enhance the flavors more.  I enjoyed it though!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Great food & service.  My pizza was absolutely phenomenal.  Defiantly recommend coming here.   The pierogi pizza and wings are my favorite"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings on the planet! I don't know what they have in their sauce, but it's amazing. Just left here with my mother. BETHANY was our waitress. She was on the ball tonight! we had Stromboli (tonight's special bogo half off). We also had the pepperoni crisps, chili cheese fries and I had their wings obviously! As usual service with a smile and everything was made perfect. They have really great burgers here. I got a meatball sub and garlic park wings to go. I'll post pics of those later. Food wasn't cold. She brought out appetizers first and then double checked when we were ready to have our meal out. Their tall beer is cheap and it is TALL! this place never disappoints. They sponsor rec teams! FYI. There are specials on game days as well. Parking lot is small so park on side street or park across the street. That's your best bet! I really enjoyed myself tonight and Bethany made it even better because she was on point! Booths are fluffy people friendly!"}
{"text":"Dined in with the wife, every time I come here the food is fantastic, the beer is on social for some Ludacrisly good deal and the service is quick. It's a good bar to drink but a bit noisey for a date night"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and always enjoyed it.  Possibly this last time it was just the service that left a bad taste in my mouth.  A group of 5 of us went here for an early dinner on a Sunday.  The wait time for our appetizer was about 15 minutes, in the middle of the appetizer our waitress brought out just 1 persons 5 wings they ordered for dinner.  About 25-30 minutes after we finished the appetizer she came around asking if we wanted any other drinks and never even mentioned that our food was taking a long time or that it would be right out.  The food finally came out about 45-50 minutes after we finished the appetizer.  Food was just \"OK\"  We got an assortment of wings, a cod dinner, small artichoke pizza, and a mushroom burger.  Not a large or complicated order.  The food wasn't as good as I remembered it being a few years ago - maybe the Sunday cook/staff was new."}
{"text":"Went here for Cinco de Mayo with some friends and we were surprised with how busy they were! They had someone there that was hosting a trivia game which was quite exciting and he informed us that he does this every Tuesday night at 8PM.  Now onto the nitty gritty! We ordered drinks of course! Some coronas and margaritas! The margaritas are much sweeter here for some reason which could be a good and bad thing.  I'm not sure if there was any alcohol in our beverages but the coronas.  But since they were $2.xx margaritas I thought, \"What the hell... To cinco de mayo!\"  Now the food... The pizza is so delicious!! Definitely not too much dough compared to some pizza places, which was awesome! They aren't too shy with their toppings as well so you get what you pay for!  The queso dip on the other hand.. a bit way too watery!  I felt like I needed a spoon to eat this dip because nothing would stay on the chip.  But when we ordered their nachos... It went down like funky town!! They give you a generous portion with a generous amount of toppings!!!  Overall the experience was fun! Our server was definitely on top of things even though we saw how busy she was.  The food isn't too bad, I would definitely suggest the pizza to anyone who is craving it.  The drink prices aren't too shabby.. $10 for a bucket of coronas is a beautiful site in my mind... And if it is in yours as well... Then give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Been to Dina's a few times. Nothing really sets it apart from other bars in the area. Service varies depending on which bartender / server you get. Never had a rude employee, but some seem to care more than others.  The crowd is a mix of lower middle class folks. Work boots, athletic jerseys, sweat shirts. I'm not sure if this is a sports bar or some kind of mix of a dive/sports/locals bar. No real identity.  The food is sub par. I would stick with the pizza related items, as they are definitely better than the other food items. The fish fry is deplorable. The quesadilla was a complete disappointment. Many generic items straight from the freezer bag.  Although Dina's lacks in many areas, it serves its purpose. It's not a bad place, but don't expect anything special.   For me, Dina's is more of a 2.5 star place, but I'll give them a 3 because they are not as bad as 2 stars."}
{"text":"Been here a couple more times since it's relatively cheap and as far as my friends and I know, it's the only bar on Memphis that serves food. However, the service has been mediocre and inconsistent on a couple occasions.   my friend: asked for a dortmunder, waitress: I'll check.  [a couple minutes later]...  waitress: we don't have it.  Friend: I'll take shock top  [a couple minutes later]...  waitress: we don't have that either, sorry.   Dejected, my friend ordered their only microbrew on draft: a sam adams seasonal [There are also bottled Sierra Nevada and Magic Hat].  They do have Thirsty Dog Christmas Ale on tap now.  Most recently, I stopped by about a half hour after the arrival of my friends, who ordered a queso and fries upon arriving. They still hadn't received their order, although I had been asked for a drink twice within a minute of arriving.   I split a large BBQ Chicken pizza. Don't have high expectations though: The chicken is not seasoned, the BBQ sauce tastes like any other ok bbq sauce, and it's white flour, standard crust, mozzarella cheese. For what it is, it's good."}
{"text":"Somehow I never ended up eating here, before I moved to AZ in '05, but I'm sure glad I did on a return trip to Cleveland, last week. I'm also surprised to see it only has one review! I absolutely love their hot, and garlic parmasean wings. Their stromboli, is very fantastic, as is their sausage pizza. I wish we had pizza and wing joints this good in AZ."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent.... ordered to go was told 20-25 minutes... pulled in at exactly the 25 min mark, waited in line for an additional 45mins... not a normal line where you can just pull away, this line your blocked in and can't leave even if you wanted to. By the time we finally got to the pickup window, the food was cold and soggy beyond belief. It was my first time there, was really excited about this place but ultimately extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This a friendly neighborhood place. A little loud, which is ok, just not my style. THE place to get really great wings."}
{"text":"Plus one lives close to Dina's Pizza, big trouble! We have been there twice in the last 30 days. My favorite is the Hot Artichoke (artichoke and jalapeno) pizza!! I've also had Dina's Delite and Spinach Bianca Pizza. We have always called ahead and picked up our pizzas within 15/20 minutes without a problem."}
{"text":"This place is known for good pizza and that is certainly true.  In addition, they also have a pretty large and eclectic menu and I have enjoyed everything I've had off of it.  The place is always kept clean and the staff is friendly.  The one downside is parking.  Even when the place isn't very busy the lot seems full.  There are parking restrictions but they're not clearly posted, I ended up finding signs in tbe bathroom advising where its safe to park."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST local pizza joint in the neighborhood.  We love the pierogi pizza the most-but you can't go wrong with any other pizzas you might choose.  I love the buffalo chicken, and it is especially great on the buffalo chicken salad if you're feeling like getting your greens in.  The homemade ranch is the best in the city.  You must give this place a try-  they even have a drive thru to make your pickup smooth and easy!"}
{"text":"Yum!! This place was great. My friend lives just blocks away and had never been. She had heard good things about it, but never had tried it. Yum! We had the wings and shared an Italian sub...and they did not disappoint! Friendly service, and comfortable, real people atmosphere.  Prices were good.  We want to try the pizza, which looked popular and delicious! And there WILL be a next time, very soon."}
{"text":"So this spot was recommended by a coworker & I decided to give them a try.  I go to order a slice of pizza but they don't do pizza by the slice.  I figured there was the possibility of that, so no problem. At the time, I didn't feel like buying a whole pizza just to get a slice so I looked for something else that I could order that was unique that would make my trip worth it. I went with the pepperoni crisps.  They were described as deep fried pepperoni which I've never had so I was pretty excited to try them.  I get them, go to the car, reach in the bag and what do I find but borderline burnt pepperoni! Like, pepperoni chips. I expected them to (somehow) have been fried in a batter which they weren't so I was disappointed. Not sure why anyone would like these but maybe it's a Cleveland thing.  I wouldn't say they were horrible as I ate a few on my drive but I would not order them again.  The positives are, the place was busy, staff was friendly.  Seems a good place to catch a game.  If I ever get back here, I'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good beer selection,and quick service, and every barmaid has a excellent ass. This place is known for its pizza and it usually is pretty good. The last time i was there it was a little under cooked. I did try their fried pepperoni, It was very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Dina's with the family this evening for dinner.  I was jonesing for some good pizza today and Dina's is my go-to spot for a good pie.  We waited a few minutes to be seated, but it was worth the wait.  We ordered beer, wings, pizza, and stromboli.  The house BBQ wings showed up fairly quickly.  Our server was terrific.  She kept our drinks topped off and was really friendly.  A while later, our pizza arrived with the stromboli.  The large pizza was half pepperoni and half deluxe.  Boy, was the deluxe delicious.  The sauce and the sausage had a sweet flavor to it.  The veggies were delicious and crunchy.  I loved the deluxe pizza and I want more!  The stromboli was also very delicious.    The food was just awesome.  Great gastro grub.  Great service.  Love Dina's!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Dina's in a couple years decided  to go there since I was down the street. It was not the same. The waitress we had was slow. She was more concerned with the regulars. The wings were sub par and over priced. Will not return."}
{"text":"Food Excellent. Service Excellent.  Beer and wings OVERPRICED. HIGHWAY ROBERRY !!!!!! 70.00$ for 4 beers 10 wings and 2 small meals ???? WTF ????"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Dinas since my softball days of going after a game. Recently they are hiring bunch of young high school kids that don't care about service or food being made.  Back to back mess up on my orders for delivery.  Ordered pizza and wings one night the young girl answering the phone wrote down the wrong address after  a hour and half of waiting I called and the manager said my pizza was sold to metro hospital since no one answered at address they tried delivering to that they got wrong. Dinas pizza made me wait another hour before my new pizza got delivered and the manager compensated us by giving us a 20$ credit.   Today we order pizza and a soup using our 20$ credit and the delivery guy shows up with just a soup.  Who delivers just a soup ? A 5 $ soup at that ? They forgot our pizza and tried saying it wasn't on the order.    I will never order from here again. The service has went downhill and prices went up doesn't make any sense.  Train your workers Dina they are messing up your business.  need to pay more attention to customers."}
{"text":"1/26/15 Monday 6:00pm -   The food we had tonight was really good. We had the Stromboli as it was buy one/ get one half off. That's a good thing because we ordered small portion, and we were served the large, higher priced item. I don't believe it was intentional, and we didn't fuss since it just meant we'd have leftovers. The large order was two Stromboli per person, with each having about 6 cuts, so that was a lot of food!   We also had a small order of wings. I had the mild which are pretty much the same anywhere you go - my son had the hot carribean and he loved them. He even got a side of sauce to bring home. Wait service was good overall but for the portion mistake, and I asked for another beer which was never brought - but in all fairness - it's kind of loud in the place and she probably didn't hear me. Again, I didn't fuss. I just figured that was a sign I didn't need it, and honestly with all that dough in my belly, I'm glad I didn't have it.   I really like the design of Dina's - with the old roll-up garage doors now serving as windows. I believe it did indeed used to be a \"filling station\" and now they cleverly market that into the name. I can attest to the fact that you will get full at this restaurant.  The only detractor for me is that at the end of the day, it's a sports bar. I'm of the opinion that there are far too many sports bars and that nice, mid-price places where you can have good food *and* good conversation are a dying species. Oh, and to the Yelper who complained that Dina's doesn't have a large selection of microbrews/crafts etc. That's what Ohio City is for or go to Fatheads in North Olmstead."}
{"text":"Ahh Dina's where do I start first off, wings are usually FANTASTIC! Sometimes however I have had some very bad wings, but as of late the wings have been fantastic. The pizza is really good and menu is plentiful. The reason it's only 3 stars is service is AWFUL! There have been too many occasions now where our server has either forgotten about us, taken forever or just plain disappeared completely. I'm not sure what the issue is with service but man have I had more the a few incidents with it being terrible.  The food is good though! Which is why I always go back, but somewhat regret it."}
{"text":"Loved that they have a pick up window! Place your order via phone and just go through the drive-through to grab your food. Thank God they have that feature because parking is a nightmare. There was not a single spot when I went to go pick up my food. Pizza was OK, nothing fantastic in my book. But their loaded french fries with cheese and bacon were unbelievable. Super indulgent, but very good."}
{"text":"My friend lives across the street. We decided to have a couple drinks at Dina's and enjoy the summer night. The pizza reminded me of Zeppe's. It was alright. I also had a couple of the jerk wings and was pleased. This is just a regular bar to drink at and zone out. If I lived in the immediate area, I would be stopping here every once in a while."}
{"text":"We have tried just about everything on their menu, dinners, salads, sandwiches, wraps!  All very good.  Nice place to eat in, we do carry out on PJ evenings.  Love the BLT Calzone, pepperoni bites (appetizer) and I really love the meatball pizza!  We love her wings, and salads! Good service, good food ! Nice bar when your eating in!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've also heard that they have great wings. It's always packed, but no worries, you can order a pizza to go. It's a popular neighborhood joint that has gained popularity throughout the city. It has a fun environment and down to earth, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Dinas for well over 10 years. It never fails to provide outstanding service. The food is always great! The pizza is awesome, one of the best around. I love the chicken wings! Boneless or not, the sauce is amazing. Drinks are always good and cold. This is a special little spot always! Love Dinas!"}
{"text":"It just keeps getting worse here. The first few times it was good. The wings are good. But the service is horrible. The wait is outrageous. Don't believe the advertised drink specials. Apparently Long Island iced teas on sale rotate between a bottled kind & a horribly made one. But expect to pay full price regardless because they always claim the one you purchased isn't the \"special\" even if you say you want the Long Island special! They don't apologize for the wait or if your order is missing an item.   Update: went back here on 10/2 with a party of 3. Although the service was much better, the food has possibly gotten worse. Ordered 10 wings in a dry rub. The wings were soft and rubbery, almost like they has been microwaved instead of fried and the dry rub filled the basket. The nachos had some kind of white queso cheese instead of shredded cheese like they previously had. There were big chunks of iceberg lettuce and big chunks of tomatoes and onions and some whole black olives. Before ordering and paying extra for the chicken on top of a salad we asked our server if it was real grilled chicken and told yes, however it was obvious a frozen chicken breast with fake grill marks that had been heated up in water or the microwave. I made a mistake last night coming back here and won't do it again. I'm pretty disappointed because 2 years ago I would have given Dinas 5 stars"}
{"text":"Very consist in the inconsistency of menu items. I have visited here on several occasions and left underwhelmed each visit. Friends have said this is a great restaurant from the past, but in the present it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Been here many times since we live within walking distance. It can be loud between the TVs and the bar, so many times we do pick up orders. I absolutely love the drive through pick up window, it's a little too convenient! I've never had a meal there I didn't like. Their pizzas are excellent, homemade dough and sauce, and they make their own ranch dressing too. Chicken parm is a fav, love Taco Thursdays too!!"}
