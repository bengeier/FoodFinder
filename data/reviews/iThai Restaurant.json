{"text":"Ordered take out last night based a a couple of local yelpers reviews. (Big up to Adele W and Paul L!)  their reviews did not let me down.  Y-U-M!!  Since it was just my wife and I we only ordered 2 dishes - Both were fantastic and the portion sizes were massive - so much we both had leftovers for lunch today.  Veggie Pad Thai Medium Spicy.  - no other words to describe it - SO GOOD!  My wife is preggers so food in general has been a touch and go thing with her lately - But i watched her pound back half an order of this tasty treat with no problems.   I had the Chicken in Peanut sauce with Jasmine rice...  Just plain delicious.  Lots of white meat chicken & veggies (and not just sprouts)  Red and Green peppers, Onion & Carrot.    Only negative is you have to park a couple of blocks away and walk... Even with this small hassle i will be back.. Here's hoping that iThai keeps the quality up, i am looking forward to trying many other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm not one to go to a Chinese, Thai or Japanese restaurant, and I'm not a fish lover, so when my sister said i should try this place and see the options, i took the challenge and ever since I've wanted to go back (two weeks ago).  I only got the General Tao Chicken, but it was fantastic (Take out). It was a large bowl of saucy chicken with green peppers, chili peppers, and green beans with noodles. It was large, and i ate it all, wanting more. I'm pretty sure it was a meal for four, but it was too good to let sit in my fridge.  I'll be heading back soon, i hope."}
{"text":"Slayyyy ithai!   My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years and enjoy our visit every single time. We have our set menu items and the staff has come to remember us and what we normally order.   We have tried other Thai restaurants in the area and none compare to the quality of the food at ithai.   I would recommend trying their Pad Thai and Wontons for an appetizer."}
{"text":"Gotta love authentic Thai food and this place is one of them. Not many in the Durham Region. Too many passing off as Thai cuisine but the ingredients are not proper. I've tried everything on the menu, and I love the Basa Pad Cha wow, amazing fish recipe. Pad Thai, Thai curries are Soo yummy. Freeeeessshhhh ingredients. How can you go wrong. I recommend this place to anyone wanting to eat authentic Thai food. Love the decor inside it's a mix of modern with a few Thai stuff on the walls and for sale! Make sure you have a Thai beer (Singha) when you dine in, it adds to the authenticity. The owners are lovely people, so friendly."}
{"text":"We only eat out once a week so I like to make sure we choose somewhere that will not disappoint. Unfortunately, this place was disappointing. We were the only patrons in the restaurant at the time and the service was incredibly slow and inattentive. After receiving all of our food except my husband's order of Basil Beef we were not told it was coming until 5 minutes later so we had thought they had forgotten it. Unfortunately there was no one in sight to ask. After another 10 minutes our server came out and told us they didn't have enough beef to make the order. By that time we were almost done eating. The food was quite tasty but based on the service we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overrated on yelp. I went there based upon the average rating on yelp, and was really disappointed. The food there not only did not taste well, but also lacked the Thai flavor as supposed to be. On top of that, the customer service was not great. Overall I would not recommend this restaurant as worth  visiting."}
{"text":"Couldn't say the food was that great. I've had much better Thai food without a doubt !!"}
{"text":"Food - Delicious! I had yellow curry and husband had noodle stir fry, plus soup of the day, crab wantons and spring rolls as an appetizer. All delicious, flavorful, well spiced and delivered within 15 min of ordering. Not only was the food delicious, but the restaurant has a dinner special where you get an entree and 2 appetizers for $10.95! You cant go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Today, my wife and I had the Pad Thai and the Spicy Noodle (thick rice noodle), and both were fantastic! Their lunch special also included delicious Tom Yum soup and a spring roll for $6.95!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this Thai restaurant last night and I was pleasantly surprised. The place is clean and inviting. The food is great and tasty.  the service was good. For the price, it is an excellent choice. Glad I tried it and I'll be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"The food was nice here with a good kick of spice. It doesn't compare as well as some of the great Thai places tat you can find in the city, but for Whitby it's worthwhile visiting this place!"}
{"text":"So now I've been back a few times and I'm pleased to say that my first experience wasn't just a one-off. This restaurant consistently serves great food!  A couple of weeks ago I was back with the same friend and I tried the Cashew Nut Stir Fry with Rice (Chicken) and opted for the Mango Salad over the soup-of-the-day.  First of all, I have to say... I could live on this Mango Salad! It's bright, refreshing and covers all the bases... sweet, salty, soft & crunchy! Absolutely a must try!  The stir fry was prepared nicely with an ample amount of chicken. For this lunch option, it was served with rice and two small vegetable spring rolls. Fantastic!  Yesterday, I was back again but this time I brought my husband. We both ordered from the lunch menu and I had the General Tao Stir Fry with Rice (Chicken) and he had the Cashew Nut Noodle (Beef). We both had the Mango Salad. :)  Both dishes were excellent, although I think I received more meat in my stir fry than he did in his noodle dish. Everything I've had at this restaurant has been incredibly flavourful and a joy to experience. These two dishes were no exception!  I definitely plan on working my way through their menu!!  Note: The prices have gone up since the first time I was here and now range from $7.50 - $9.50."}
{"text":"How hard is it to find decent Thai food in Durham? Impossible it seems.   We ordered Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai, and Red Curry and Lychee with Fish. They said it would be 45 minutes for delivery.   60 minutes pass and still no food. When I called, I was told that their driver never showed up and they needed to call someone else in. They apologized but there was no incentive (free spring rolls maybe?). I expressed concern that the food will be cold. They said that it should be ok. I told them that my husband is upset at the delay. For our troubles, we'll get free spring rolls on our next order.   90 minutes after ordering, the food came. The driver apologized and gave a completely different story for the delay. The food was cold. The Pad Thai was gummy as all the sauce was absorbed by the noodles. It was all clumped together. The Tom Yum was too sweet. The Red Curry did not have lychee which is strange as the name includes it.   I'd give this place zero stars if I could. I guess my search for decent Thai in Durham continues. Or I'll just cut my losses and head t in to TO instead."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, hot food. We often stop here on our way through Whitby, well worth the drive off the 401!"}
{"text":"Good food, good order time Pick up, like their spring rolls and pad Thai, friendly service but expensive delivery. Overall good"}
{"text":"We love their pad thai! When you eat in there is a special menu for lunch that you can order a choice of thai dishes, it comes with choice of mango salad, spring rolls, or soup all for around 7.99! The staff is friendly and quiet which compliments the tranquility of the establishment. It is our 'go to' place for Thai in Durham."}
{"text":"iThai is located just south of Dundas on Brock street on the East side of the road - watch out for it since its pretty easy to drive by and miss altogether! A note, parking here can be tricky since its just street parking but a few blocks over there are some city lots and MORE street parking so just drive around a bit. On weekdays after 6 and I think on weekends, the parking on the street is free.  We came here on a Tuesday night feeling like something different for dinner (adventurous for my boyfriend) after checking out the website. I've never been a huge fan of Thai food but I was open to trying it and the menu looked pretty good.  It was very quiet when we arrived, just two other tables in the restaurant but we had a look at the menu, ordered some drinks and both decided to go with one of their dinner specials. You can choose from a few different kinds of pad thai, a beef dish or two and curry. I went for the golden curry and my boyfriend got a beef dish of some kind on rice. The best part about this deal is that each one comes with two little appetizer type things. I went for the mango salad and wontons and my boyfriend got edamame and springrolls. We each got to try a bit of each even though they were single sized portions and they made the meal just a bit nicer than just dinner.The wontons were perfect, super crispy with tasty insides and a nice spicy asian dipping sauce.   When my curry came, the portion size was deceiving. What looks like a small portion is NOT, at all! The rice had been put into a little star form and popped onto the plate and the curry was served in a bowl. My only thing is I would have rather the curry been poured over the rice, isntead of having to sort of pour the sauce over the rice, get some of the veggies and meat on my fork and then add rice onto it as I ate, but this isn't a huge deal. Super flavorful and I couldn't even finish it!  The best part about this dinner was the price. I think the special is 10.95 (dine in only) but for all that food, it was well worth the price. There was one guy serving and we think one guy in the back making food. Nothing really worth writing about in terms of the service, it was adequate and friendly but the guy was really quiet.  Overall, I'd recommend iThai and will definitely be back to try out some more dishes!"}
{"text":"iThai is a good option if you are in the area and looking for some Asian food.   Lunch (from $7.50) and Dinner Specials ($10.95) are good value especially you are dining alone like myself.   I would not compare to real regional Thai food as this maybe a little unfair when you look at the price point.  For lunch I ordered the Thai Spicy Noodle with Chicken ($8.95) with Mango Salad and Spring Roll. It was alright and I enjoyed that.  Great for a quick meal. I will be back next time when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I really loved the garlic fried rice, the smell of the takeout on the way home was so delicious.   Also had the glass noodles and found them to be delicious, wish the veggies were cut smaller though, makes for a bit of an awkward eat.  I also had the shrimp chips, which were pretty disappointing, I found them really dry and the fairly disintegrated."}
{"text":"Great food and healthy considering the amount of vegetables they add! Vegetarian friendly and non oily. Trendy atmosphere and good service! Easy to find parking."}
{"text":"I've had delivery from Ithai a couple of times. The Won Ton soup has a tasty broth and is good, The Padh Thai  with chicken is very simple, with noodles cooked just right and a slightly sweet sauce absorbed into the dish. The flavour of the Tamarind (I think) is just right and the cracked peanut lend some texture to one of my comfort foods. Does Ithai compare to a restaurant like Mengrai Thai in Toronto? I don't think so, but for Asian  take out I think it's an excellent choice in Durham."}
