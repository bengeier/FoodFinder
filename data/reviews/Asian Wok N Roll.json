{"text":"Great food at affordable prices. Our favourite is the vegetable Manchurian. Good variety, however, be forewarned that spicy really means spicy here."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's parent's 30th anniversary. We called ahead to assure we could finish our meal as long as we ordered by last call. We did and once 10pm hit, they kicked us out and was arguing saying it was rude on OUR part for staying that long. Terrible customer service, even yelled/ swore at us outside of the restaurant upon leaving."}
{"text":"Soooo got my meal and wine everything is going ok, food is good. All of a sudden I see a cockroach crawling on the top of the booth by there head.  So I go to  leave and after paying for this meal and wine that I left on the table, I informed the lady that they have a roach problem and she told me \" I'll look into that \" never again will I eat here or allow anyone I kno to step foot in this place"}
{"text":"Amazing lollipop chicken, with their special green tangy spicy sauce. Party pleasers for sure!!! Their deep fried spicy cauliflower is great too."}
{"text":"I popped in here because the Indian place next door was closed because of vacation. I did a quick check on yelp and saw that it had 3  1/2 stars and went in. My first impression should have been my last. A large restaurant at 6:30 in the evening that was almost empty. I figured it is Chinese food it can be that bad. It looked clean, the staff was friendly - that is the nice I can say. The menu was a mix of Chinese , Indian and Thai. I started with what was supposed to be Tom Yun soup. Not so much- it was just chicken broth with some chicken in it some nondescript vegetables and no Lemon grass what so ever. It was spiced up with some hot pepper sauce- I did not finish it. Next up was a shrimp spring roll- this was decent, good flavor and some crunch to it. Next up Yobst was King Po Chicken. It had chicken, peanuts and was spicy-  not a good rendition. If you are I the area looking for Chinese food- please keep on looking"}
{"text":"Terrible service, they do not accommodate to the needs of their customers. They are rude, unmannerly and the level of service is poor. Your decision to come here will likely turn into an evening of dissatisfaction. Kim (the owner's daughter) was especially rude and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Hakka restaurant. I've been coming here for three years now as I cannot find a better place that serves Hot n Sour Soup.  The place is very clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. The owner recently introduced sushi into the menu which gives the place a great selection of food. The sushi is very fresh and high quality. I recommend the Green Dragon Roll, Dynamite Roll, and Lobster Cocktale. You will not be disappointed.  This place has the best Hot n Sour soup in the GTA. Also, I recommend the Chili Chicken, their trade mark lollipop chicken, and Thai fried rice with pinepples.  The price is very reasonable ($9 to $15) and the serving sizes are huge! Go there on an empty stomach.   They have another location in Millcreek Mississauga."}
{"text":"Love the food here...and the spice level...OMG! HOT! I love it! I have a very high tolerance for peppers. I cook with scorpion peppers at home. It's on the list for hottest peppers in the world... (/www.cayennediane.com/hottest-peppers/); yes its really hot...not for the weak. But I digress. Whenever I order food, I always get it made extra spicy! And man! do I love it! so much flavor and that kick of heat! If you like spice, I would definitely recommend Asian Wok n Roll. I have had the Chili chicken, Manchurian chicken, mango salad, even the noodles can be made spicy! This is my go to spot for Hakka!   The food is very authentic, I had a friend who is Indo-Chinese (Hakka) recommend it to me. So i figured I must try it, and it didn't disappoint. The mix of spices and flavours, all just make your mouth water.  The only reason it's not a 5 star because each time I have gone in there, the girls weren't friendly at all. They don't make small talk, not a very welcoming attitude in general. They don't even really have a smile on their face. I've managed a restaurant before, and I would not have my staff act like that to customers. When I call ahead and speak to a gentleman, he is super friendly, too bad the young girls don't follow suit.  But do go for the food, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner with my wife. I've always liked this place since she first introduced it to me. Some of my favorites include the crispy chili beef and the shrimp and lobster sauce. They have a great lunch special for $7.99 with your choice from a big selection of combo dishes.   Tonight we made the mistake of ordering chili beef with gravy, (We intended to order the crispy chili beef) but it turned put to be fine as well. The spicy garlic chicken  was, as my wife would say, \"the boss\".   Wasn't the first I'd visited, and it won't be the last either. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best Hakka place to eat at! They never lack flavour or consistency."}
{"text":"Un restaurant chinois à proximité de l'aéroport de Toronto avec un menu qui mêle cuisine chinoise et les traditions Hakka (des chinois Han du sud du pays). Si vous êtes de passage à l'aéroport de Toronto pour quelques heures et vous avez envie de manger un peu de cuisine asiatique, prenez donc un taxi pour Asian Wok N Roll."}
{"text":"Great  hakka  Chinese  spot  in mississauga.  The chilli chicken  is really good.  The portions are  big  always  end up taking the  leftovers home reservation is  recommended"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I was recommend by a friend a long time ago, and never had the time to go because it was so far!! But let me tell you, it's worth the drive.. I now know where I will be eating before a trip to the airport. We had lollipop chicken, crispy beef, Thai fried rice, green dragon roll, hot and sour soup, chilli chicken and manchurian fish - all were amazing!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to an Asian fusion restaurant. My relatives took me there because normally you don't get that kind of food in California. Well, I when we got there, it seemed okay. The waitress took our order of chili chicken, manchurian chow mein, and another manchurian style noodle dish. After 20ish minutes, the food did not show.   Finally, they brought food but they only brought the chili chicken. My aunt, who is a vegetarian, had to continue waiting for the noodles. Eventually, both noodles dishes came but no rice. Finally, after much waiting, rice appeared. A couple of times the waitress would serve our dish to the table next to us, which a bit awkward and annoying at the same time.  Overall, food was good, can't argue there. However, service was just not that great. In the end I wouldn't go back here because of that and also because this isn't the only place in the GTA."}
{"text":"We've been to the location in Mississauga and decided to try this location after coming back from a trip.    Ordered seafood and beancurd soup, hot and sour soup, crispy beef, house special Hakka chow mein, and veggies and cashew nuts.  The bean curd soup was hot but the carrot bits were still raw.  Have had better hot and sour too.  IMHO the noodles are better at the other location.  There is a generous mound of noodles but the flavour is lacking.  Crispy beef was good but Eddies is better.  Veggies were bland and forgettable.  Also didn't help to have some guy snorting back his snot loudly the entire time we were trying to eat.   Decided to stay away from the sushi selection as that looks like it is something new they're trying, not to mention Hakka and sashimi don't sound right together."}
{"text":"Most funny rule that I ever came across. Ordered lunch for my kids and wanted to share it only to be told that we can't share our meals that we have paid for. So surprising and strange considering that this is not a buffet.  Asked to see the management but told that no one is here and also it has not been written anywhere not even in fine prints."}
{"text":"I give this place props for speedy cheap food and friendly charming staff, but it's nothing but extra greasy hakka food, if I got very drunk in Brampton and if this place was open at 4am I would consider coming in here again.  We had rice, noodle, 2 chicken and a shrimp dish all were your typical grease balls of unhealthy taste.   The interior deco also has not got much going for it, it doesn't seem to be a dirty place despite being in a pretty unattractive intersection.  I only came in here because I was dragged along with some work people and now I know better and will protest this location choice for next time."}
{"text":"This is a good place for both lunch and dinner they have a wide variety for both lunch and dinner ... The food is fresh the staff is also very friendly ... I went for Hakka manchurian chow mein and the very good manchurian veggie balls ... I asked for it to be extra spicy as that is how I like it and the staff was very good in adapting to change the flavors... There are a few Chinese places I like so this one is good on my list and I am certainly gonna visit this again with friends .... Also not to mention the sitting is huge and there is a beautiful aquarium to look at !"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite Hakka (Indian + Chinese Asian fusion ) restaurants in the Airport area. On a cold day, I love divulging in a hot bowl of hot and sour soup (with great amounts of shrimp, chicken, tofu, and bamboo shoots in a hot and spicy broth), followed by a plate of spicy chili chicken and beef Hakka chow mein.   I've been here NUMEROUS times, and I'm falling short of reasons to give it a 4-star rating based on my previous experiences or a 3-star rating based on my last visit. o.O  Okay, I'm going to stick with my 3-star rating here only because I think my last visit was the only slight downfall with the service and quality of food. We ordered hot and sour soup which was delicious and a plate of Hakka beef. The noodles had changed (long thick round fat noodles rather than then long flat noodles, there was hardly any beef in it (see posted picture); there was barely any pepper, and no coriander garnishing. I don't know about you, but when I cash out $15 dollars for a dish, it's because it hit the nail on the head; sadly, not this time. Service: Slow.   I'm still sticking with 3-stars for this place. Based upon my prior experiences, and I know they can definitely change. I will give them one more chance and see if anything has changed with both service and quality of food for an extra star for a 4-star rating."}
{"text":"Fast, average food  Terrible service -- found a VERY sharp pin in our noodles. They did nothing about it and said it sometimes comes from their vegetable packs (???) makes zero sense.   Gave us $2.34 off our bill?? Could have choked on it."}
{"text":"On a weeknight returning from a function nearby, we were starving and this was the closest restaurant. The plaza had cars parked incorrectly all over which was annoying.   The restaurant almost empty as perhaps it was a weekday and about 45 minutes before close time. Seated promptly and we knew what we have at a Hakka restaurant. The server was quick.   Ordered medium Hot and Sour Soup which came in very quickly. The Soup was good. A little more veggies and bit of more spice and it could have been perfect (4/5). For people with a preference of a mild hot and Sour this would be perfect and people like can hot sauce if needed.   The Veggie Manchurian was top notch as well. The pakoras well made and sauce perfect. But some it went dry too quickly (4.5/5). The accompanying rice quantity perfect and a bit over cooked.   The Hakka Noodles were cooked perfectly with less oil as requested and the veggies had a good crunch. Although less veggies, it tasted good."}
{"text":"This is a Hakka restaurant by the airport. It is yummy and authentic, one of my favorite for Hakka food. their hot and sour soup is really good, especially for a cold day. Their chilli chicken, vegetable chow mein, crispy beef and noodles are all yummy. They also have lunch special mon-fri, it comes with one dish and rice. They are similarly priced for Hakka, $10-$14 per dish and the dish is generous. I always have everything with gravy (choice of crispy)  because I mop my rice in the sauce =D  There's also a group on going on today so grab it here:  http://www.groupon.com/r/uu6243205  Awesome deal 410 for 420 worth."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time had a very bad experience with the workers over there I had a big group. The food was not good at all the food  tasted the same the only thing that was good was the chicken corn soup. when it came time to pay they did not want use to pay debit they wanted us to pay cash it is 2018 who Carrie's cache nowadays. At the end of the day I don't recommend this spot at all"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh. I enjoyed their Tangra Chicken Sizzler, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Crispy Beef with Machurian Chow Mein and Veggie Fried Rice. We always go here. There is lots of seating. Do try their lollipop chicken. Staff is friendly and their extra spicy is not that spicy. :)"}
{"text":"My favourite place, love their Manchurian rice and crispy beef . They are fast and the place is good to take your friends and family"}
{"text":"Best chicken wonton soup in town. Been to this location maaanny times as the service is incredible! Food portions are huge and I am yet to have anything not tasting good! I adore their butter massala chicken ! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"[] In Brief [] Lunch specials are cheap and nothing tastes bad, but there are significantly better Hakka options in the the GTA.  [] In Length [] Asian Wok 'n Roll (AWnR) was my first experience with Hakka food, back in 2005 or something. I don't remember the flavors or menu items per se, but I can still remember the general feelings I had when trying shrimp pakora for the first time. They can be best described as this face: ... (0_o) ... followed by the words, \"Where have you been all my life?!\"  Every trip to Toronto/Mississaga thereafter involved other Hakka joints so I kind of forgot about AWnR for the most part. That is, until I was back in the area with a friend. I was telling him about the fond memories I had of AWnR and the influence it had in shaping my tastebuds and expanding waistline. My friend's curiosity ultimately led us to choose AWnR for lunch.   My friend, a Calgarian, kept exclaiming about how cheap the prices were compared to what he's used to back home. It seemed to be on the cheapish end; prior to tax and tip, the lunch specials were in the $7 range. Choose between a spring roll, or a carbonated beverage can with your lunch entrée and rice. I went with the spring roll. It was disappointingly bland. The entrées we chose were two different things, but they tasted very similar. I'm not sure I could differentiate between the two if I had my eyes closed. Actually, even with my eyes open, I probably couldn't differentiate between the two because they looked and tasted similar enough that I was left wondering if they were in fact the same thing. A whole lot of rice was included in the mix. Probably more than I would have preferred but I don't think, \"This restaurant provided more sustenance than necessary\" is ever a reasonable complaint. The food tasted fine, but I didn't have any culinary-induced fireworks going off. At the time, I wasn't hungry enough to want to add shrimp pakoras to the mix. They're probably still amazing. Or they're not, and I've romanticized my first Hakka experience.  Two days later, my friend, and I went searching for the Hakka fireworks experience, which was found (like it always is) at Chilli Chicken House. Go there. Go here if you want to play it safe. AWnR is not bad, but in an area that has such a variety of nomworthy noms, \"Not bad\" is not good."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place far too many times to count..so on a drive by today decided to give it a go.  The place is much larger than it appears, but it was fairly quiet so there was no wait for a table.  We ordered chicken pakoras to start. They were excellent...seasoned perfectly will a heat that builds.  Next up was the chili chicken. It too did not disappoint.  Final dish was chicken manchurian chow mien. We were warned when we ordered that this dish was very spicy, but it wasn't at all.   All tolled, bill came to $40. (Tax in). This included the above, plus a diet coke and a small order of white rice.  Staff were very friendly and the place was very clean.  Would I go back...yes, if I was in the neighbourhood. I wouldn't drive the 25 minutes it takes to get there from where I live."}
{"text":"Excellent Indo chinese food if you are in the Brampton Mississauga area.  We tried variety of stuff, and everything was top notch.  Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A 1/2 decent Chinese food ( not authentic mostly Hakka (mix of Indian / Chinese flavours)) place. But we've been going there for years! Great service.  Fast. I don't think I've ever dined in, always take out. Food as with most of these places has generally the same taste / gravy. But at least the food is delicious, seems fresh and steaming hot! Their soups are absolutely amazing! The hot an sour is almost a regular for me. Chilli chicken / pork always good options! It's not spicy much... But that's for me, it might be a bit extra for some!  All in all a good place for take out or done in. Good prices and worth the trip."}
{"text":"You know you're in Mississauga when the Chinese restaurants have pakora style Manchurian!  Came here about 25 minutes before closing. The restaurant was empty on the inside; there was only one other family. The waitress took our order quickly and was helpful in advising us about how many people our order would serve.  We ordered Regular size hot n sour soup, pakora style veggie Manchurian, and veggie Hakka noodles.  The regular size soup ($8.99) is quite large and can easily serve 4 people. The soup was spicy and had a lot of vegetables. It was thick in consistency. Overall a good soup, my friends enjoyed it very much.  The pakora style veggie Manchurian ($11.25) was plentiful in size and could feed 3-4 people. It was served in a light gravy. The Manchurian was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  The veggie chowmein ($9.50) was also a large serving. Could feed 3-4 people. It was a traditional style chowmein noodles. Very flavorful, but came with few vegetables. I would definitely order again.  The service was alright. The waitress was helpful, but it's clear that she hadn't been trained. At the end of the meal she brought the card reader to our table. I'm not sure if this is because they were closing or if this is standard practice.  The restaurant is large inside and there's a lot of seating.  Parking lot outside the restaurant is also large.  The restaurant is definitely Indo-Chinese. The food is great, and offered at a very decent price. I would recommend it to anyone looking for good indo-Chinese. The meal was $33.61 for 3 people."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome Hakka food! Not sure why this place only has three stars, but I love Hakka and I think this place has my favorite Hakka food. When I'm passing through Brampton I always make a point of stopping in. Strongly recommend The chili chicken with gravy, the garlic fish and the Manchurian beef."}
{"text":"The most awful service in the entire area and the food quality is absolute rubbish never coming back to this and would not recommend this place .   A very unhappy customer:("}
{"text":"Pretty good. We got there about 7 and ordered almost right away. Food was pretty fast, so I thought it'd be like microwaved or something lol... But it wasn't and it was good. I got the mango chicken, sauce wasn't too sweet and had fresh slices of mango too. Very good.   I also tried the Masala Coke (Masala spices, lemon and coke)... Tasted like a fat bomb in your mouth... So gross... Like I had a sip, let my buddy try to see his reaction, and it stayed at the side of the table. I was really interested in how it change it, but it was gross."}
{"text":"As you enter the am Ambience was really nice compare to most Hakka Chinese restaurant. We ordered their Manchurian chicken soup which comes with fries noodles on top. I think that was the best part of the entire meal. It had so much chicks tofu noodles onions mushroom and peas. The mild flavor gave a nice and thick flavor. The house special rice was not too good it tasted a bit oily but I love shrimp so I just kept on chowing down on the shrimp, but my friends didn't like it too much. The garlic chicken spicy was the best decision we made. It was not really spicy ( tip- take the red/green chilly out, those are very spicy)   The green chilly is what made it more spicy then I could handle but simply take them out. For the quantity of food, I think it's a bit towards the pricy side but the food was really nice. Overall, it was really good and the food is really tasty, I would say about -15$/ person with soup and main."}
{"text":"Here is something todo on a long weekend Monday.  Head own Derry to Asian Wok with your spouse and baby, get an order of crispy beef and manchurian shrimp with white rice for take away.  Proceed down airport rd and each one planes land over the Wendy's . If your lucky you may catch he Emirates380 land !!! Malton is in he building !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING TAKEOUT!  All around this is a pretty decent place to get sushi. Good quality, tasty, and reasonably priced. It's a regular for me and I'm not about to stop going there any time soon.  That being said you need to be careful and check your takeout order before leaving. Mistakes are common and it's very inconvenient to go back all the time and have your order fixed. Common mistakes include the wrong maki rolls, or missing wasabi and soy sauce (especially when you ask for extra)."}
{"text":"Looks east Indian influenced a clean place overall washroom felt like a dungeon Sorry just love my Asian foods never going they used the same bland sauce for my two dishes if you like the same taste foods go here or else skip entirely waa...dissapointing: ( white rice was the instant 5min rice type not something I would have seen in this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I have had their lunch specials, and it was delicious.    Their hot and sour soup has the right amount of kick!   The chilli paneer was very savoury and the chilli chicken was just yummy.   The lunch combo was well worth the price, they do not skimp on portions.  It's a healthy sized lunch meal, which we both had enough for dinner too."}
{"text":"This unit used to be an Indian bar and hangout. Current owners did not do much in terms of upgrading the decor although now it is clean. Ladies toilets 12 steep steps down are pretty old, too but well cleaned. And those are the only negatives of the place.  Staff is very friendly and available. Portions are huge. A couple of hungry people should be satisfied with one medium soup - each would get about 2 smaller bowls of it. Main dish split between two plus two small bowls of rice are more than sufficient to get rid of hunger pangs. So far we tried beef in black bean sauce and chilli chicken and they were delicious.  I have always been the greatest fan of hot and sour soup and check it out whenever I eat Chinese food. In my humble opinion this is it - the best tasting hot and sour soup on this side of the border ( a contender - a small Chinese jaunt near Market Street in Philly)."}
{"text":"Place looks new but food is beyond horrible. Attitude is also not very pleasant. Seems like owner is devoting all his energy towards making money instead of providing quality food and customer service. Many other good alternatives available in area or in short drive."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but this was the first since they moved teo doors over. I like the spacious seating area, but the AC was far too high, to start with.   Ordered the chicken teriyaki bento lunch, and the salad and miso came quickly. The salad dresding was tasty, but they drowned the salad in it. It was missing some usual ingredients I've had with other Japanese salads, like sweet peppers or carrots.   The bento was huge, but left lots of empty space as the food portions, other than the chicken, were small. One single mini spring roll, no plum sauce, a trio of fake-crab maki rolls, dried out Chinese rice (which should have been sushi rice), and the chicken. On the plus side, the chicken pieces were large and teriyaki sauce not overbearing. But, not even one tempura?  I guess that's why you don't go to a Chinese Hakka restaurant for sushi/teriyaki!  My wife had black bean chicken, which was up to their usual standard - this is my regular dish here."}
