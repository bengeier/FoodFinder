{"text":"Spanish food to me has to be fresh with flavor. I went to Moreno's by chance one day with a group of friends/family. I ordered 2 small tamales and found myself wanting more so I ordered 2 more tamales and was impressed by the flavors colliding inside my mouth. I've been to their Mesa restaurant and had the same experience when I ordered their chicken tacos and was blown away. Their food is delish and their price very reasonable. Love the atmosphere and their employees are clean and professional. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The Sonoran Dog was really good. I actually have been craving them now ever since. The bacon can often ruin an otherwise decent Sonoran Dog. The bacon used here was top notch- crispy...thick...delicious. I am aware that this isn't the place to go if you are on a diet. My friend couldn't find much to order because of her cal counting. More healthy options would have give this place a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"They have stopped using multiple servers for each table and the chips are much better than they used to be. They may charge for more bean dip... I cant remember but the salsa and chips are unlimited. 

Great improvement! 

Great place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are good. The rest of the food is disgusting full of fat. I couldn't even finish my burrito I felt sick. The cashier girls are really rude they need training on good costumer service. They seem angry and depressed. I would NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"Place was always super duper dank the previous times I came, but I could tell they've been slacking due to their dog shit food and super awkward waiter. Soup was cold and green salsa tastes like a johnny sins bukake. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"You got to love the food..........................
Only strike, and it's not enuff to take a star off.....too much butter  on cheese crisp and greasy tacos....

But this place is legit."}
{"text":"This little place produces really good food:  everything I have tried I love.   Only one question I have:   are flour shells made using  hydrogenated oil?...can't find anything with that information.  Would love this information to adjust my menu choices...Truly a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The Flautas here are so good, have always been fresh, crispy, and generous with toppings (cheese, Guac, sour cream and pico). I'm also a fan of the salsa which is different than any other place I've been. I always get chips at Mexican places and morenos always serves fresh, crisp and lightly salted ones.
I like that they offer the Moreno's Burrito
(Stuffed flour tortilla with your choice meat, rice, beans, special salsa, onions, cilantro, cabbage, enchilada style, served with rice & beans) but if you ask for it vegetarian style-no meat, they have made a big deal about omitting it in the past. Need to get some vegetarian options on the menu already!
we've been going here for years and the quality has never declined. This place is legit. Totally worth the small inconvenience of finding parking or a table inside. It's a small business and I want them to be successful so I'll continue to go and recommended them :)"}
{"text":"Only one word AWESOME! The food and drinks are great and at a reasonable price. Next time I'm in Arizona I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Nothing like sitting at home in your pajamas, waiting for your Mexican food to arrive :) I couldn't decide between the carne asada burrito and the bean burrito, so I ordered them both, with a side of guacamole. I split them each in half and saved the rest for tomorrow. The bean burrito was REALLY good. As for the carne asada burrito, it was good but not as delicious as I was hoping. Maybe it's the quality of meat, but I really can't complain, it was very reasonably priced. The BEST part of the burritos are the tortillas. They are delicious! I will definitely order from them again, how can I not; they are fast, inexpensive and THEY DELIVER!!!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on Tuesday night. We love the bean dip. The red and green salsa were good too. I had tortilla soup - a meal in itself. I also had the street tacos combo. They were really tiny but the meat were seasoned well. The rice is tasty and fluffy. The retried beans were really good. I normally don't eat beans but Moreno's were good. Hubby had gecko burros. It was tasty and filling. We'll definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and they have been excellent. Today, I am totally shocked by the flavor and quality if the food. The salsa (which was one of my favorites in town) was soupy, runny, like water consistency. It lacked flavor. 

When I brought that up to the worker, she just shrugged her shoulders like saying... Who cares. 

We had steak tacos and we had to pick through the fat. There was so much fat in the taco, it grossed me out. 

It's really sad, because this was my go to place for street tacos. 

Not any more.... Regretfully, Morenos is off my list!"}
{"text":"Never again.  Outside the obvious comments of bad training, slow service and bland food, out of the three times I have eaten there I have gotten sick immediately after twice.  Not very good odds.   Maybe the fact that they were cleaning the floors with cleaning agents all while serving food should have been a dead giveaway.   I think the health department needs to make a visit and management needs to review their training."}
{"text":"Best Chicken tortilla soup EVER.. hands down. The wait during lunch is kinda long but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I love Moreno's Mexican food however this is my first time at the Mesa Main Street and power location. The food is still good the menudo excellent. Tamales decent but too small. The price is definitely went up and the service did suck today. Somebody needs to learn how to manage the workers who sit idle and do not take care of the people. It took 45 minutes to get the food. It took 35 minutes to get water after ordering 15 minutes into it. Hopefully the management can start managing."}
{"text":"This is our favorite mexican restaurant! I love the bean dip and tortilla chips...always fresh! The service is excellent...people friendly! My best choice for a date night?"}
{"text":"Always fun to find a hidden gem!  I only live about 3 miles from this place and just happen to find it.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a sit down, waitress staffed restaurant.   The service was spot on and the food was delicious!   We didn't need to find another Mexican food restaurant but I'm glad we did!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Moreno's.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a cheese chili relleno, all a la carte.  NO rice, NO beans.  The bill was $22.  I think I was overcharged.
The food was nothing special."}
{"text":"This was my third visit, and my last. Each time I come, I try something else- thinking my last poor experience was just a fluke. It's not, this place just stinks. 

This time, the food was average, at BEST.  Though it was hot, it took awhile to get out and looked like it had just been thrown on the plate! The worst was the service. Never have I ever tipped under 10% or had such a poor customer service experience. The waitress came to take our order and then disappeared (busers brought out our food, and then too disappeared). We literally had to waive her down to ask for our check, and even then, she never showed up again. Ten minutes later, we had to waive down the manager to get our check. No water refills, no checking on our order (when we needed items), nothing. Lunch was miserable, overpriced, and long. DO NOT BOTHER."}
{"text":"I hangout in Chandler a lot and me and my friends love to go to local places like Moreno's Mexican Grill. It's a small place and when you walk in it looks really clean and welcoming. The employees there are happy and inviting. We go about two to three times a week on average to get hot dogs. I cannot get enough of Moreno's hot dogs they are so delicious and have all of my favorites on them. A Sonoran hot dog from Moreno's has saut√©ed onions, beans, tomatoes, mustard, Mexican crema, and the hot dog wrapped in bacon. 
 You order your food inside but your hot dog is made outside right in front of the restaurant. Only the hot dogs are made outside though the rest of the food is made inside. Anyways, the hot dog is made right in front of you the man asks \"con todo?\" meaning with everything? I usually get it with everything. While he is preparing the hot dog you can smell the all of what he is putting together, it smells so good and when you see the finish product your mouth waters. As I take my hot dog back inside to eat, I cannot wait to dig in!  I get so guacamole, chile, napkins, and a fork to eat everything that has fallen off. I begin to eat and a flood of different flavors overwhelms my taste buds, all coming together to form a perfect blend of deliciousness.
 As I finish my hot dog I start to feel full and satisfied with what I have eaten. I love going to Moreno's for the hot dogs. And it is open late, therefore on the weekends when you are out and about and need to get something to munch on. That is tasty and affordable you can hit up Moreno's and get yourself a Sonoran hot dog!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place several time and each time I am always satisfied with the service and great tasting mexican food."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. The hot dogs--do you belly a favor and get one. Wow. And the adobada burrito is amazing. Small place with big tastes. They have found a new regular with me. Also the service has never been bad--I've been here in the evenings once a week for a few weeks now and never had a problem. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm probably over doing it, but I've been here 3-days in a row. I'm getting my Mexican fix before heading back to Detroit. It's been a few years since I've been here. I'm never disappointed after eating at this place, the people are friendly, and the juice drinks are sooo good! I can't eat anything like this in the D, not even in Southwest Detroit - Mexicantown. 

They have a hotdog stand outside their door for those late night cravings. The guy who mans it is friendly and is there everyday except for Monday nights. 

Maybe I'll make tonight my 4th visit and eat some grub! Yummm!!!"}
{"text":"Husband-o and I needed some cheap good eats for dinner after I returned from a business trip.  Scanned the Yelp and were not disappointed by Morenos.  Though not the absolute best Mexican food in the Phoenix/Rural/Metro Area, it is the best in Tempe.  
Started with the requisite chips and salsa.  Despite having to pay for them, they were worth the $2.49 and they brought us a free refill of the hot, perfectly crispy and salty appetizers.  Salsa had good smokey flavor and the right kick of heat.
I got the #2 combo with a chicken taco and a beef burro.  The taco was a bit small, but very similar to those you'd actually find in Mexico on the street carts.  Beans and rice were pretty run of the mill, nothing spectacular, but definitely tasty.  The burro was great.  The best part was the steak, though it was more a chopped beef than a shredded (which I personally prefer), but the right-off-the-char grilled flavor was intense and very savory.  The tortilla was better than most, but you can find better in Central Phoenix if you want to make the trek.  
Husband-o got the beef chimi and was very happy with it.  The guac was better than average.
Overall atmosphere is very laid back and Tempe-esque.  Service was great (though there weren't many patrons to serve...was Thursday at 7pm).  Looks like they had a good selection of Mexican beer and a fun variety of margaritas.
The value is great, too.  I, who rarely have leftovers, took home a box with half the meal, as did Husband-o.  Total bill was $19.
Another great asset, you can opt for table service, but can also just order right at the counter!"}
{"text":"Like this place.  Courteous attentive and friendly service in a fresh and pleasing atmosphere. There were plentiful servings of very good food."}
{"text":"After waiting an hour for our food it was cold. This was the third time I tried this restaurant hoping the service would get better. I will never return."}
{"text":"I have eight in Mexican restaurants all over the valley California New Mexico Nevada friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food deafly makes it a six star restaurant I would recommend it to anybody at any time it is fantastic"}
{"text":"I love their strawberry drink, its not really agua fresca because it's a little on the thicker side, but still tasty.. I've tried their sonoran dog & it wasn't that great. It was too soggy. (Get your ass to Tucson to experience a good sonoran dog). (FYI: El Guero Canelo is amazing!)
I've also tried their menudo & carne asada torta. But my favorite is the California Burrito. If your in the area & want Mexican food it's a great place to go."}
{"text":"I've tried and loved their burritos, tacos, tamales, and horchata. I found Moreno's because they're the only place in the area open past nine. The avocado based green sauce is also great."}
{"text":"A friend and I just returned from a magnificent lunch at Moreno's. She judges the quality of a Mexican restaurant on its fish tacos; I, on its chile relleno. We decided to order both and share. We had the two taco plate - grilled salmon with pineapple salsa, grilled fish with mango salsa, rice and beans. Everything was absolutely fresh, hot, and delicious! We asked if we could have both the ranchero and green sauces for the chile relleno served on the side and were graciously  accommodated. The chile relleno was perfect, oozing cheese, and the best I've ever had. Both sauces were excellent but who needed them? And beyond the food, the service by all staff was also exceptional. Moreno's on Main should not be missed!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good grilled chicken lettuce wrapped taco, chips GREAT! Served with 2 salsas, bean dip. Salsa is mild. Great service. Patio great, but a bit loud with Power traffic.  Inside seating nice too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Uhm first off, let me say this is my new joint to come for tacos and burros. Wow just Wow, it is that good. I came here because my friend said that its better than average. I said its better than better and not to mention the gorgeous women that work there is such an eye candy. Not that I'm a perv but it makes you feel good about eating here. I would recommend it if tour in the area and need some food to eat late at night or just stopping in for a burrito."}
{"text":"The food is ok but be careful if you order something to go. They messed up our order and when I called to ask them if they could correct it, the manager lectured me that I placed the order incorrectly. I'm not saying \"the customer is always right\", but it would have been nice for the manager to apologize for the inconvenience. Never going back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. A bit annoying that dine-in customers get chips and bean dip complimentary but to-go customers have to pay for the bean dip. I don't have an issue paying for it but I can't seem to understand why a dine-in customer's business is more important than a to-go customer; especially considering that a to-go customer consumes less resources (i.e. staffing, building space rental cost, utilities)."}
{"text":"I work in the area and am always looking for something good and quick for lunch. I really like the food at this place, but the owner/manager makes the experience something less than desirable.  He makes you feel like you are an inconvenience in his day if you ask for something a little different.  We like the red versus the green salsa and on to-go orders, he gets upset if you ask to trade out or for an additional portion cup.  He is also very condescending and rude to his staff, right in front of customers.

It is too bad about the management philosophy as the food itself is actually quite good.  My office has decided to look for another option in the area when we are craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"I went to this place because everyone was recommending their Sonoran hot dogs. This was not my favorite but I ordered their mango quesadillas and they were amazing.  The chips and their bean dip is also great. Will be coming back to try other things"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! Moving from Tucson, I felt the Chandler area was lacking some authentic, quick Mexican spots... then we found Moreno's. Staff is friendly, food is delicious and consistent (California burro!!!!), and the salsa bar is a nice addition. We come at least once a week. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We just ate lunch here.  Chips and Salsa were great.  I ordered the Pollo Fundido.  Other Mexican restaurants I've order this at have drenched the jalapeno cream cheese over the dish, but not here.  =(  I was disappointed when I asked for sour cream, because after the first bite, I didn't even think there was the \"cream sauce\" on the dish.  After the fourth bite, I got to some of the cream sauce, and it was maybe 1 tsp slabbed on the top.  I then asked for more cream sauce, which I told was going to be a dollar charge.  (It was actually a little over a dollar, and then I was also charged for the sour cream)

Our waitress was a sweet, but as a server, I would have NEVER charged extra for a sauce that was already on the dish, and probably not for the sour cream.  

I was disappointed with the service and the lack of fundido sauce.  I wouldn't return to this location.... stinks since it's so close to my work. I wasn't expecting a $15 lunch today. 

=("}
{"text":"The food is good, just didn't like how the employee was mopping a foot away from my table as I ate. Smelled the pine-sol over my food. I asked him to move back a little because the smell was so strong. He looked at me and continued mopping. Not coming back."}
{"text":"One of the top Authentic Mexican food we have tasted. Expection to  my hubbys cooking.. Here in the Mesa, Arizona."}
{"text":"The food here was greasy and gave me indigestion. I ordered the cheese enchilada and a chicken one as well. I thought perhaps it was just the day i went so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned but alas, bad again. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is *fantastic* and the amount of patrons at any given time proves this.  I would give 5 stars, however I have never had a pleasant experience with the staff at the counter.  Unfriendly, never smiling, appearing as if they wish they weren't there.  Aside of the counter staff, order anything on the menu and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. I seriously go a coupe times a month. My husband is obsessed with the Sonora Dogs. I get the #1 and love it. Their bean dip is fab. If you are looking for tasty and pretty fast service stop on by. 
 It is so good when I did a teacher luncheon this was the place I ordered for for 70 people. Amazing prices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.....when I arrive in AZ around 10pm and have a desire for mexican comfort food....I head for this place and get 4 tacos of carne asada, corn tortilla with everything. Then get some salsa and a glass of horchata and i head home for a delicious feast!!!
I"}
{"text":"I had a craving for a shrimp cocktail like they have in Rocky Point so I looked online and saw that Moreno's had one for $10.99 and it was on. When we got there the price was $15.99 but we went ahead and got one each,later when I got home I looked at their website and it was from 2017 so it went up five bucks with no adjustment on their website. The shrimp cocktail was delicious no doubt about that with lots of shrimp and avocado it was a joy to eat.  
    Our bill came to $37.59 for two shrimp coctails and a small horchata and tax,today when my husband went over our bank statements he saw that someone gave themselves a $5.00 tip,even though our receipt said $37.59 we were actually charged $42.59! We will never go back! Beware! I'm giving it 2 stars because the shrimp cocktail was good,but between the misleading website and giving themselves a $5.00 tip when we picked the food up at the counter and no waitress or waiter I'm probably being too charitable."}
{"text":"my absolute favorite place to get carne asada tacos! So yummy! Go on wednesdays for $1 tacos! The cabeza tacos are also really good. You have to get a sonoran dog also! I get mine with sour cream instead on mayonnaise because a drizzle of mayo doesn't look or taste that appealing to me. If you have room for dessert the fried ice cream is sinful! Cinnamon-y and sugary and all kinds of goodness! Fairly priced and if my boyfriend didn't make me stop I would eat tacos until I exploded! The only downside to this place is the size. It's a bit small and gets really cramped around lunch time (you're lucky if you find a table) but hey I don't care, as long as I can get my food, I'm good"}
{"text":"My dad ordered a burrito off the menu that according to the menu was $6.95, according to our waitress the menu was printed wrong and we were charged $9.95.
 
I got a Sonora Hotdog. It was ok.
The only thing good was the free chips and salsa. I love the Chandler and Mesa Moreno's locations.
I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"We ordered to go orders on Friday.
I personally ordered a Carne asada torta which came with fries and a limonada.
The fries were soggy. 
The torta was okay, vegetables were fresh but the meat lacked flavor. Otherwise, it was a pretty good size.
The limonada was good and refreshing.

Don't rely on their online prices the actual prices are about $2-3 more dollars per item."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite restaurant!! Love love love their authenticity.. we come here quite a bit, never feel rushed like most other restaurants, the staff are amazing always friendly, Jessica the waitress/ bar tender definately knows how to take care of your customers, always smiling, welcoming.. we are so grateful you are in our neiborhood Morenos!  FYI bloody Mary's are BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Its hard to find a good real mexican resturaunt with authentic food in this area. Dont listen to bad reviews from when they first opened of course they were having trouble, give them a break. Everything about this restaurant now is great,  the atmosphere,  ambience and of course food. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Just finished eating. Have to say the food was good. Liked what I had. Didn't like that they nickel and dime you for extra bean dip. And the service was horrible. Never picked up the empty dip containers. And nobody in our party got refills. Guess they are trying to nickel and dime us there too. Gave three stars just for the food."}
{"text":"Have been here on multiple occasions and have never ordered something I didn't like.  Some of the wait staff could be trained to be a little more professional, but they are all very young, so its understandable.  aside from their professionalism, they do a good job, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Food is OK but its not a comfortable environment when the owner hovers over the cash register and watches everyone in the dinning room.. He makes it uncomfortable when your trying to enjoy your food and company then look up and the owner is staring.. Staff other than that is good.. I just don't think the owner needs to be at the front watching everyone. There's not even enough room for him to be up there. My mom won't even go there anymore because of that reason."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite mexican food joints. We can't get enough of their bean dip and green salsa. The green salsa is actually the best I've ever had--whenever we go we end up buying a pint of it to go. My wife always gets the tostada (a.k.a. a chalupa\" from where I come from), taco, and enchilada combo which she really likes and I usually swap back and forth between the tamale or the enchiladas. Good stuff. This is also the first place I've ever had a Sonoran Hot Dog which was pretty darn good too. If you haven't tried this place, you should!"}
{"text":"Had seen the \"taco truck\" looking thing on the corner for a few weeks and new we wanted the give it a try once the actual restaurant was open. Stopped in at 10:30am on a Sunday morning, and glad we did. I saw some reviews saying the place was dirty, etc. but it looked fine to us. It's not a fancy place by any means, and it could use some more \"decor\", but overall it was pretty much what we expected. When we were taken to the table we were given a breakfast menu, much to our dismay. We asked when lunch would start to be served and yay! We were told it was served all the time, and the waiter brought us two regular menus. 

A lot to choose from, mostly the standard Mexican restaurant fair; but then they had things like
\"Sonoran hot dog\" (pictured), and quite a few specialties that seemed to include mango salsa (so assuming this is a signature of theirs).   

After asking about lunch, I went ahead and ordered the \"Santa Fe Breakfast Burrito\" which came with a side of hash browns (the hash browns were not listed, but are always a welcome surprise!). Filled with eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, and peppers, and covered with melted cheese. How can this be bad??  It wasn't!   We also ordered the Sonoran hot dog (covered with grilled onions, beans, jalape√±o cream and mustard), which was tasty but needed more heat/flavor. 

The other item we orders was the pollo fundito, the standard chicken chimi covered with cheese. We asked for the jalape√±o cream cheese instead of the \"cream sauce\" it came with, so that it mirrored what we normally like on this item. Fulllll of white meat shredded chicken!!  Some places use a lot of tomatoes etc as filler, but this puppy was all meat!  Very tasty. Charro beans were also kick ass, I recommend you get them over the retried beans. 

Chips were just ok, and their normal salsa was a little on the sweet side. Ask for their hot salsa, that was muy tasty!

Good place. Will be back again. Soon!"}
{"text":"Moreno's is good authentic Mexican food. They have a decent selection and delicious food that comes out fast and almost always accurate. I'm a big fan of the rice and beans; I always make sure I order either a combo or a side of rice and beans. Their salsa is on the spicy side, which my fiance loves, but I can't take the heat, so be prepared for that! Otherwise they do a great job!"}
{"text":"The tortilla chips were amazing!  We ordered shredded beef tacos (3.89 each) .... Kinda expensive considering it's just a taco. The beef could have used a bit more flavor, was like a roast cooked in a crock pot that you can do yourself at home.  The red sauce was not hot at all.  Even the couple behind is was saying the same thing, the green sauce was too sweet, but the bean dip was \"on point\" ... Really liked it.  I could have dealt without the Christmas music which was playing way too loud for my tastes.  I will return to try the Sonoran dog which is supposed to be great! No tacos next time though.  4 tacos, 1 Pepsi, side of sour cream ... $20.58 (pricy in my opinion)"}
{"text":"Called in an order to go, had to repeat my order to the girl about 3 times, she seemed like she didn't want to do her job. I had to ask for a gentle man there to take my order and he took my order fine all at once.
Went in to pay & she was rude at check out. Food was not as good as the locations in Chandler & Mesa."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran dog, I've always driven by it but now stop all the time. I get 2 each visit but can only ever finish one haha. A take home one isn't so bad though. Menu prices compare with filibertos and other similar franchises but morenos to me has a more authentic and fresh approach to the food the prepare. Great seasoning and spice as well with good horchata and even shrimp street tacos that are filled!"}
{"text":"Excellent service today from the greeter. Waitress and kid who delivered the food. Food was excellent, delivered very quickly. Tacos were great. They are opening a location near me and hope it is the same quality."}
{"text":"Moreno's is known for their Sonoran Hot Dogs and because they're good I'm recommending the place.  I got some for 2 guys who are from Sonora and they said they're pretty authentic and yummy.  To get the full experience it is better when the guy is outside with the hot dog cart, but if he's not it's still good.  You purchase the Sonoran dog inside, they'll give you a ticket stub, then you give it to the guy outside and he makes the hot dog.  It's a good place to go if you want to try something different and have a craving for Mexican food.  Warning: the hot dog is a little too spicy for little kids because of the pepper that is included.

On my trips I also have their green chile burro.  My only problem with that is I'm not used to having beans in a green chile burro, however, it is tasty and it has good green chile flavor.  

I've also tried their asada caramelo (beef stuffed cheese crisp) and it was slightly greasy.  The ones in Tucson are better. 

The other reviews touched on other items on the menu.  The place is kid friendly and it's a great place to have a Manzanita (Apple Soda) or Aqua Fresca with your food."}
{"text":"The Sonora style hot dogs are so good!!! The other thing I like from here is the vampiros if you haven't had some you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"Ate on 12/22/17 at Moreno's. One cheese enchilada costs $5.90 and a side of beans and rice was $1.90.  The enchilada was not tasty and definitely overpriced. The scoop of beans and rice was small and bland. Tasted like it came from a can. This place has restaurant prices but is basically fast food and overpriced. A buser came and cleaned the table next to us and used a spray bottle full of bleach to clean the tabletop. This ruined whatever chance this fast food had to be palatable. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Friend and I had lunch there. It was busy, and no wonder. The service was quick and efficient. The menu varied and fairly priced. We had a coupon for buy one meal, get one meal 50% off. The food was well prepared. Arrived quickly. Service was on fleek.

The only ding I could think of about this place is they serve Pepsi products. I mean, no restaurant ever apologizes for having Coke products, could you imagine? \"I'm sorry sir we only have coke, would that be ok?\"

Anyways good food, good service, clean, and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Awesome Sonoran dogs and street tacos!"}
{"text":"Been there twice so far. First time was good but second visit was pretty bad. Waited at the door for 5 minutes then decided to seat myself. Asked for more dip and chips three times before we got more. Asked for no peppers on the fajitas but yes on the onions. Sizzling plate came out with nothing but a bunch of dried up burnt chicken. Tamales and the wifes salad were good."}
{"text":"Pissed customer! I walked into Moreno' s with my two young daughters and had  a seat.  Three of the servers looked directly at me, no menu or greeting. Two men walk in about a minute after me and have a seat. A server takes menus and gets their drink order right away. I got up and left. Be more observant Moreno's!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I have got their has been awesome and their fish tacos are the best iv'e every had."}
{"text":"Another update on Moreno in Chandler.  it seems this place as far as me and a couple of friends feel this place is going down the  hill food wise and especially the service. I could go on and on but to frustrated with this place and the incompetents, plus the I don't care attribute.  They are constantly screwing up orders even after repeatedly asking them if they could repeat the order. I even tried to speak with them about why my orders are lately constantly getting my orders wrong, I was told they don't care. This is another example where a business doesn't appreciate your patronizing."}
{"text":"moreno's is cheap and delicious...yummy chicken tacos with cabbage, onion and cilantro...

go to here"}
{"text":"Not bad for a Sonoran Dog place outside of Tucson, but nothing compared to real Sonoran dogs down south.
Rest of the menu is good and tasty, but lacks some of the true sonoran flavors.
But it is some of the most authentic in the Valley."}
{"text":"Food is very bland.  If your looking for filler food this will work.  Service was bad, but they just opened up so it may be due to the fact that everyone is trying to get trained up.  Not sure I'll be back unless I'm starving and need something close to the house."}
{"text":"First things first, if you go here, get a Sonoran Hot Dog with everything on it. You're really missing out if you don't try one. I don't even like hot dogs that much but I get one everytime I go.

The rest of the food is great as well, crispy delicious tacos. The pork green chili is a great burrito if you like carnitas. It's a wet burrito so plenty of beans, cheese, and green chillies inside. Their carne asada is also really good but I will say I prefer mine a little more salty and on the spicy side. Still it was great and the Pico was fresh.

I found Moreno's about two months ago and I've been back three times since. This place has really great tasting and authentic food, plus as a bonus, they also have \"Mexican\" coke. Glass bottles, made with real sugar.

If you like mexican food, definitely check Moreno's out, I wish it was slightly cheaper but it's definitely worth it everytime we go."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've tried the other locations and there food is really good! I could tell there staff was new and needed a little more training, but I remember what it was like to be in the customer service industry and it can be tough. I cut them a little slack for that. I appreciated that my server got quick refills on chips and salsa and the food came out super quick. I had the shrimp Mango quesadilla and it was sweet and a pretty big. The bean dip had a nice flavor to it and it was pretty hot. The space was nice, on the smaller side but still spacious and the kitchen was hidden to the customers but I didn't mind it since I was able to smell the fajitas from the table next to me. I think overall that the food was delicious and this place just opened. I remember what It was like to be in the food service industry and it can be crazy, and due to that and a dash of human compassion I decided to cut this place some slack. The food was good and had a good ambiance what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love this place..I tried it because I went to its other location in Queen Creek and decided to give this one a try too. LOVE IT! Their hotdogs and tacos are to die for!  Its a small place but clean and I also really like their ceviche tostadas, they are really refreshing on a hot sunny day. Its pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch out of the blue because it was close to his work. The food and atmosphere was good, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and frozen margaritas! Service is friendly and quick! Reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"Considering the sea of Sonoran sit-down restaurants that is Chandler Arizona, it is with full-bellied satisfaction that I exhort Moreno's Mexican Grill. Believe it or not, their hot dogs are the most famous thing on the menu. You'd be missing out if you didn't get it with all the toppings. After you've aroused your palette, (and your appetite) try one of their burros or sopes. The grilled beef is terrific. Finish off with some fried ice cream and you'll be thanking these five lucky stars that you didn't go to Serrano's! 

A full five stars for the perfect exhibition of classic southwestern and your favorite Americana slapped together in one quaint little hut. The staff is friendly, Spanish and smiles abound, and you're always sure to get the same quality no matter when you go.  My ONLY complaint is that there is often times not enough room in the small space but hey, you can always head down to the location on Gilbert road which is roughly twice the size!"}
{"text":"We have been a fan of Morenos since we started going to the Queen Creek location and we're happy that they built one right around the corner from our house.  The crab chili relleno was my first favorite but now I am really liking the shrimp burrito with pineapple salsa and jalape√±o cream cheese.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly and attentive.  This has become our go to restaurant and always a good default."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  One of my standard go to places. Like their green salsa and beans.  Great crispy shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas.  Prefer this location to their Gecko Grill location in Gilbert or Morenos in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos in Mesa 
Very fresh great favors I highly 
Recommend

On my second try you never know and hope for a repeat.  Score. We had the chicken tacos and real Mexico cokes 
Those of you that tried these know the difference 
The food did not disappoint"}
{"text":"I would rate Moreno' s  five stars for their food and  two stars  for the atmosphere.  Music was way too loud, don't get me wrong  I enjoy music while dining  ,but it was ridiculously too loud.  Other diners were having to practically shout for regular conversation. The food was really good though, I won't be going back. This place is a take out only place for me."}
{"text":"This was the place that inspired me to my taco quest and started me eating tacos again after 5 years off. I originally came here for the sonoran hot dog, but hey a hot dog with all that stuff on it, is not a hot dog anymore. Just a lot of fillers, anyway the heck with the hot dog when you can go for the tacos.

Their tacos, many different varieties, but the king to me is the Tripe. I first tried it, it was crunchy but not quite, still chewy but their carne asada and marinated pork were awesome. Also had the marinated steak too and that is awesome. Wonderful flavors that were marinated, no need for salsa, a little lime, wished they were just more than that little street kinds. But wait, I went back and I learned you can ask them to make the tripe a little more crunchy and wow, what was good became great. Horchata was okay, not as good as the food city ones but can't be perfect. I went back here 3 times already, but I have to resist, because I am hoping to find better."}
{"text":"Best kept secret for breakfast!!!  SHHH don't tell.  Everyone else can wait in line at the chain breakfast resturants."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here the last two nights. I was greated as  i walked in. I was seated and given chips with salsa and bean dip.The food was so good the first night, i came back the next night. Excellent service and very kind staff."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 4stars... 
Their carne asada tacos are YUMMMY
Their beans must be made with crack, because I can't get enough...
Their hot dogs??? Are insanely good Mexican-style! My nana looooves their Lengua tacos... I'm too scared to try them, but if your adventurous enough...

Their condiment section is full of goodies... There is this creamy avocado sauce that will cool off any really spicy dish. They even give cucumbers which are a healthier chip... And so much more.

Wash it all down with a glass of delicious and not-so-grainy Horchata and you are all set!!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I was going to like his place as soon as I opened the door. And there are things I don't like about this location. It's small. The salsa bar is below average. There isn't a really hot hot version of a sauce there. Nothing is labeled. The waitresses seemed like they wanted to be somewhere else. And there's the music....  Ok. That said. First bite into the pollo fundito that Ellie and I both had, we were transported into some Mexican food utopia. I mean this was a good good dish. And it has definately made me want to try a different location in hopes that the food quality is the same, but the other things raise the bar a bit."}
{"text":"First and last time to this restaurant.
They were very busy on a Friday night, so either a lot of people like this excuse for Mexican food or they were mostly there for their first time too..  and I gotta believe the latter.. 
I was waited on promptly and ordered a margarita.  It came fairly quickly and was average in quality, as I mulled over the menu.. but then it seemed I had been deserted..   the family that sat down next to me 10 minutes after I sat down got their order in right away..  I waited and I waited..  and finally my waitress came back and I placed my order..  needless to say the other table got their food before I did.
I ordered the Moreno's burrito \"Mixto\" which should have both carne asada and pork adovada.  I requested green sauce over the top.  My first bite was like wow lots of flavor and that suddenly came to a realization that it's super salty!..   Examining what was salty about it, the sauce was the big culprit.. the green sauce is disgustingly salty and has virtually no other flavor.. no heat, nada..  but then picking at the filling, I found that everything was over salted..  like a lot..  then half way through I figured I couldn't find any of the adovada..  asked the waitress (who was very hard to get attention from) shouldn't I be able to tell the difference between asada and adovada? (I was being facetious) and told her I believe I only got carne asada. She offered to bring me a \"sample\" of the adovada so I could taste it.  It came..   and I realized, no I apparently I did have both meats because they taste and look the same!  No way they should be so similar you can't tell them apart, Oh and the meats were cut into tiny tiny teansie weensie pieces..  about 1/4 \" sq for the larger ones..  I felt I was eating softened kibble..  not MEAT.
anyway..  very poor service, even for being that busy, and the food I ordered at least was on the verge of nasty it was so salty.  The Marg was ok.. but she never asked if I wanted another..  just brought the bill when I had stopped eating with plenty left on my plate.  No offer to compensate even though I complained about all the above.  Then I had to wait forever for her to pick up my cc to close out the bill.
When you have a really good place like El Palacio a block down the road, you don't need to accept this garbage.  (P.S.  El Palacio used to be terrible when they first opened but they have turned that place around big time and it is AWESOME now, and a pet friendly patio!)"}
{"text":"I was shocked at the amazing service provided by a woman, I think her name was Lexi? She was very accommodating of our large party. For every food related inquiry, every impossible request, this God-given woman had a satisfactory answer for all of our concerns. Her professionalism and friendly demeanor gave us a welcoming presence. If she isn't a part-owner in the next few weeks, this place is doing something wrong!! 

p.s. The chips lacked salt"}
{"text":"We were seated and told the server would be right with us. A lady brought us chips and salsa, placed them on the table, but didn't say a single word to us or even acknowledge our 'thank you'.
We sat there for ten minutes. No one came to our table. No one acknowledged us. So we left and we won't be back. Horrible service. It was two in the afternoon. Eight tables were full. We saw three different servers and there were two ladies just standing at the host station talking to each other."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food! The green chili enchiladas are made with tomatillo sauce and so savory! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 0 stars for customer service and food I would. I worked a 9 hour day and went to order some dinner for my wife and I. When I get there I'm greeted by an employee who must hate their job at the cash register. I order a vegetarian burrito and vegetarian chimichanga. Simple. I get home and put the food on my table while I get changed from a long day. When I come back to sit for dinner with my wife the first bite I take is filled with pork. I almost vomited. I packed it and went back to see that same employee. SHE WAS THE MANAGER. I explain what happened, she took the to go container and says we'll make you a new one. At this point I was so unhappy with the service and the food that I asked for a refund. She takes my card and refunds me. Here's what really hurt, not one apology for the mistake and such a lack of empathy for me having to drive back. I will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mexican food restaurants in the area. Their salsas and bean dip are amazing. Also, their spicy spinach and cheese dip are amazing. We come almost once a week. My only complaint is the service. We tend to need our beverages refreshed semi-often or need an extra napkin or two when we have our kiddo with us-- and WITHOUT FAIL-- we don't see our server for over 15 minutes at a time. They rarely come to check up on us, so usually my husband has to go to the hostess counter and ask one of them to hunt down our server. If the food wasn't so good, we wouldn't go because the service is terrible."}
{"text":"This review is for the new one at Main/Power.  We have eaten there twice now - both experiences good.  Admittedly new and people and the patio not completed but it beats Serrano's hands down.  Food is excellent.  My only complaint and was mentioned by another reviewer is they charge a $1 for an additional small container of the bean dip which I think is not a good business model.  They are busy and could use a few chairs or benches outside to sit while waiting.  JGH"}
{"text":"Had the fried ice cream and carne asada tacos! Both were delicious. The fried ice cream is a lot so definitely shareable. As for the tacos, my bf and I had 2 each and oh man those were so yummy. Very flavorful and not like that soggy gross meat that many fast food places have. 
I will definitely be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"We went here craving Mexican food. I'll start off by saying I had no problems with the parking lot but the place seemed pretty dirty (ie. door, tables).  They started cleaning while we waited for our food but they dumped a bunch of windex or something right outside the door to get in so we had to either jump over it or walk through it on the way out. Not the most appetizing thing to smell while you wait for your food. We tried the enchiladas, cheese quesadilla, and carne asada burrito. The burrito meat was really unappetizing...my husband only took a couple bites and decided to forgo it. The cheese enchiladas were okay, nothing special. The rice was good but the beans smelled and tasted funny to me (maybe they are just more authentic Mexican than I'm used to, idk). The cheese quesadilla was on the greasy side but tasted good. I think I will pass on Morenos in the future unless it's to try the sonoran dog."}
{"text":"Went to the new location on power Rd in Mesa.  Expected much more after reading all the raving reviews from the other locations.  We were throughly disappointed.  First the salsas come in little dip size containers,  have to break your chip to even dip it in there.  Speaking of the chips, they don't taste freshly made but store bought.  We ordered Carne Asada Mexican street tacos and there was no seasoning whatsoever in the meat and the sauce that came with it didn't taste like much of anything.  We also ordered the carne asada nachos supreme and all that came on it was the bland meat with a little bit of the tasteless beans and not so much cheese. They did not look desirable nor taste like much of anything.  We had shrimp street tacos and a chicken street taco and had high hopes after the waitress raved about them and have to say they were okay but nothing special.  Again everything was tasteless,  lacking flavor.  (On a side note,  the one thing we did like was their rice and the waitress we had was very nice.)  They did have alcohol on the menu however they don't even have their liquor license yet so you can't order anything.  Needless to say this place has a lot to work out and hopefully they do figure it out as there are many other fabulous Mexican restaurant options around."}
{"text":"Four was generous. Honestly our party debated between 3 and 4 but I was in a good mood. :) Everything was... eh. Kind of bland. Safe. Not memorable. The gluten free enchilada sauce was nice. The salsas weren't bad, but not great. The pollo fundito was missing some green chilis or sauce or SOMETHING to give it some flavor. The quality of the meat was good, the presentation was acceptable, but... give it some flavor! The service was good. All of the wait staff was attentive and our drinks stayed filled. We were looking for some decent Mexican food that is open on a Sunday in this part of the valley but we'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and walked out after waiting 20 mins for a server to come to our table.  No one came by, no water, no one to take our order, nothing!  Servers were either all yacking behind the counter or all 3 of them waiting on 1 table. 

Everyone should skip this place and go to New Mexican Grill instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great prices! I usually get the flauta special which includes 3 flautas, refried beans, rice and a drink. My husband swears by their baja fish tacos. Every time we go it costs about $23 for the two of us. 

Pros:
-Delicious food - recommend the flautas and baja tacos
-Great prices - about $8/person
-They serve margaritas and some beers

Cons:
-Parking lot gets kind of full, but nothing too bad

We've been frequenting this place very often!"}
{"text":"I must say that this is the best taco place in all of Tempe.  I usually had to make a trek to the west side to get some decent tacos.  This involved considerable time, money, and having to be in the west side.

The flour tortillas, the meat, the drinks, and the fact that they put cabbage on the tacos were all outstanding.  The hot dogs were decent but I would hold out for the real deal bacon wrapped ones, if you can find them.  However please note the following:  The corn tortillas were below par (think mission brand).  To many a mexican food joint are ruined by there tortillas and I am making a stand!!

Overall it is a great place and I hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Really no change in quality in terms of food, which is still pretty good.

They still have not changed the prices on the menus on their street shrimp tacos.  If the price on the menu says the taco is $1.89 then that should be the price when you get the bill. Instead, the price on my bill was $2.19 for the taco."}
{"text":"It's OK not good or bad I got a Carne sade burrito. It's tasted a little boring not much to say wow am coming here again. The salsa was not really good the reason I have this place 3 stars because of the clean place but if the want more business they need to step it up on the taste."}
{"text":"Solid, inexpensive, authentic-ish Mexican food. Love the little street tacos. Carne asada has a good flavor. Cabeza (head) and lengua (tongue) are also offered. They're both good, but the texture's a little strange. They also have a great little salsa bar and yummy horchata. 

It was voted best Mexican in Tempe in the New Times I think. There isn't a lot of great competition, but I would agree that this is my favorite in Tempe.

**Edit** No more salsa bar. Just ask for them at the counter."}
{"text":"I have not ordered one thing here I didn't like. Some of my favorites I order are the pastor tacos, Burritos are big, shrimp cocktail, menudo, and love the fried ice cream. I enjoy the fruit drinks they serve fresh. The staff is friendly and keeps the place clean. The pace is small so it gets full fast and not many seats.  Next time I would like to try the hot dogs here and see if its as good as they look. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I think it's to pricey for hole in the wall Mexican food. If you are thinking of trying it I believe you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Been to multiple locations, they are not really that good. But what gets me is that they are not authentic and they are charging &2.50 for ONE STREET TACO, it's really unbelievable, I could understand if they were like unbelievably good but no. I actually think they are taking advantage of the fact of where they are located they can charge people more! Y'all need to get it together...I'd rather go down the street to senor taco!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the reviews for this place, i guess the ppl that gave good reviews don't know what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like. The carne asada tacos were bland and i had to add salt and drown them in the salsa. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I purposely made a yelp account so I could rag on this particular restaurant and how frustrating they are. I hope the owner sees this. 
Notice two stars and not just one? I love their food. They get an extra star for that. The chips salsa is the bomb. Enough compliments...
But the service is terrible! If I could curse up a storm about them, I would. They deliver only on occasions.. it seems like. They close up early, it's a college town... What college town delivery restaurant closes up shop early?  We asked for delivery at 830 and they said \"We close at 9\". Well it's not 9 yet wtf?! 
The service sucks. It's so bad I'm no longer going to order from this place again. After they denied our money.. We drove to the one on Horne and Broadway, which was still open, placed an order to go, and the guy couldn't make a salad. We asked for just a dinner salad with no cheese or dressing.. And somehow they were incapable of doing that. They took sooo much time asking how to make the salad that every time I gave them clear specific instructions, they would come back with something like chicken on there. A regular salad... With lettuce tomatoes onions. Did you hear me say Chicken? The sad part to this is that they left a menu for delivery Anyway, you should join me in boycotting Moreno's. It's a horrible experience every time."}
{"text":"The best! By far my favorite burrito in town. The carne asada burrito here is like no other. They add pinto beans and rice, which is what sets them apart from the rest. Also the chicken tacos are awesome and my boyfriend loves the california burrito. They have a salsa bar with carrots, cucumbers, and jalape√±os--green and orange salsas are amazing. Honestly I have never had an experience here where the food was not on point. My only complaint is I wish there were a closer location! Nonetheless, I do not mind making the drive to some awesome food :) moral of the story: get to morenos!"}
{"text":"We were desperate for a quick lunch and didn't have enough time to do the chips and salsa thing at Garcia's so we stopped in here around 2PM last week. As soon as we walked in, I noticed it was a bit chilly and even thought the air condition could of been on, nevertheless we proceeded to place an order.

If you're looking for a comfy place to chill, note that the dining area is a small seating area with some seats that aren't comfortable because there are no cushions on the \"seat, \" due to this part being made of iron, so yes, it could be cold if you're wearing shorts.

We got friendly service from the young man working the counter and then waited about 15 minutes before our combo plate of two shredded beef tacos and a rice and beans was brought to the table.

Excited we dug right in, first the rice and beans and then a bite of our individual tacos. Disappointingly, the rice and beans were cold and the taco shell crisp and cold to the bite. Strangely enough the deeper you bit into the taco where the beef was, it became warm, juicy and flavorful. So your experience basically went from cold and then hot. It probably would of been a decent meal if the entire combo plate was served hot.

As far as returning to this place, when you total it up, coupled with one soda, this quick lunch ended up being $25 plus tip. Pretty hefty for a quick meal. For my budget, I prefer Garcia's with their hot chips, salsas, fondido, consistently hot food and of course their comfortable seats."}
{"text":"Great food, service, the beans & rice are awesome! Fajitas are amazing so are the cheese enchiladas and carne asada."}
{"text":"I was torn between a 3 and a 4 star but I thought I would be generous. 

This place or should I say the Sonora Hot Dogs came highly recommended. It is a little hole in the wall Mexican joint that looks like an old Taco Bell. The counter girl was friendly and cheerful. I had 2 hot dogs, an asada taco, and a bottle of coke. What the hell it's a new and a new budget for calories, right!!!!! The dogs where really good and different, nice twist, really love the bun. This thing is filled with bacon, beans, mild peppers, cheese, mustard, mayo, oh and a hot dog. Oh, I should not forget the say the the dog is on special Thursdays."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida, los burritos muy buenos..
El servicio es excelente y la sopa de tortilla la mejor. Totalmente recomendable."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I was craving a Sonoran Hot Dog last night so I decided to give this place a try. Just as the Yelpers before me stated; to order a dog you go inside and pay then give your ticket to the hot dog cart guy in front, super easy process! The Sonoran Dog was all and more than I could've imagine. I had mine with everything! All of the toppings and condiments seemed to harmoniously work together. If you plan on eating this in the car I recommend getting a fork because the bun can easily tear since it's steamed. It was so good that next time I'll probably get two. For those of you who are worried about this being dive, give it a try I promise you'll like it. Both the cart and the actual restaurant were very clean. Heck the inside even had the menus on flat screen TV's."}
{"text":"Had the chili rellanos, was not very good, tasted like a giant cheesestick. Beans and rice were okay, beans tasted a bit watered down"}
{"text":"Love Moreno's!! Great salsa and bean dip with chips! Yummy shrimp or fish taco. Amazing cheese enchilada and beef tacos!! Great service and always great food!! YUM"}
{"text":"Was super excited to have this open close because we really like the one at Gilbert and Germann. Have ordered take out twice and they messed up the order both times. First time they added jalepenos to the burrito (that isn't supposed to have them in it) and it was to hot to even eat. Second time we ordered jalepeno cream cheese instead of sour cream. Got sour cream. When we let them know she said \"well we got the burritos right\". Their customer service sucks. I understand new location and growing pains but no eye contact, no smiles and no I'm sorry when your order is wrong is just ridiculous. The food is good if they get it right. I'm more irritated by the attitude than the fact they got it wrong."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird place, weird ambiance, but decent quick Americanized Mexican food.
It's like a McDonald's, but with a hostess and waiter. We sat next to the entrance and next to the strange little waiting area. It was pretty busy on a Friday night, but was perfect for my taco and enchilada craving with our kids in tow. I wouldn't go as a date night restaurant, but I would go back. Margarita next time, definitely."}
{"text":"I come here for the Sonoran dogs. They're delicious!! Occasionaly, I'll get the carne asada street tacos which are also really good! I haven't tried much else on the menu simply cause I don't like to stray from what I love!! I'm sure the rest of the food is really good too. I did see pollo fundido on the menu. I may have try that next time."}
{"text":"Ah Moreno's...

Let me tell you a little story about my first Sonoran HotDog..

I was watching over my mother-in-law one night after she recently had surgery.  My wife came to relieve me, and I thought that I'd pick up something quick for her to eat before I went home.

Usually, if I can't decide what to eat, I drive around until something strikes my fancy.  I drove passed Moreno's, and I did a \"double take\".  I noticed there was a hotdog stand in the front and I thought it was a peculiar thing to have in front of a Mexican restaurant.  It really peaked my interest.

I decided to give it a shot.

I ordered 2 hotdogs and the guy asked me: \"Todo?\"  I guess it means \"With everything?\"  (I say that because I'm Filipino, and I'm often mistaken for being Mexican, Samoan, Hawaiian, Japanese, and a few other races.)  The guy really didn't speak much English, but in a Mexican restaurant, I wouldn't want it any other way.  Ok.. back to my story... He asked me:  \"Todo?\"  and I said \"Sure.\", not knowing what was that entailed.  He put the hotdog in a bun and started stacking layer after layer of condiments on it.  The level of artistry and proficiency this guy displayed when making this hotdog was astounding.  I was a newbie to Sonoran style hotdogs and looking at that thing was just too much for my mind to comprehend.

I took the dogs back to my wife.  Her and my-mother-in law took a look at them and had the same look on their faces as I did.  I said my goodbyes and left to go home.  

Half-way home, I get a call from my wife.  She's raving about how good those hotdogs were and asked me to go back to Moreno's to pick up 8 more.  Apparently, they liked them so much, that they called her aunt and brother to come over to try a couple.  I thought, \"What the hell... I'll try a couple.\"  You never forget your first bite of a Sonoran Hotdog from Moreno's.  There's something magical about it, sort of like your first sexual experience.

We usually get our share of family and friends visiting from out-of-state, and Sonoran Hotdogs have been a sure-fire hit with EVERYONE we bring to  Moreno's.

To this day, I randomly receive text messages from friends and family to the effect of  \"I'm craving those Mexican style hotdogs.\"  You'll crave these hotdogs like a crack-fiend.

Anyways..  they also have pretty good tacos.  Go there on a Wednesday,  they have $1 tacos that day.

I believe the Sonoran Hotdogs are $1.95 on Thursdays.

Try the pineapple drink they have at the counter.  It is very refreshing.

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"\"Let me yelp this place really quick..\" I said to my friend before we came in. What a mistake it was to give up that idea.

As you walk in, the place is clean and cosy. Service is fairly prompt, even though there was only one waiter working during lunch time.

I had a fish burrito that arrived ~15 minutes after ordering. It consisted of undercooked rice, a pinch of vegetables, and fried breaded shoe sole for a fish. Honestly I once had a better fish burrito at Del-Taco across the street.

My friend had chicken sizzling fajita, which was rushed in sizzling and smelling pretty good. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor and had the same undercooked rice and 97 year-old salad for sides. The guac and sour cream were fresh, though.

Worth noting is that the salsa was pretty good, full of flavor with just the right bite of hotness. So if you're looking for some chips/salsa and beer, go for it. Otherwise, don't do this to yourself."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. Baja Fish Tacos delish but the small is TINY which I learned the hard way so opt for the large. Crispy asada and chicken tacos exceptional. Reasonably priced. Clean inside and great customer service. Excited to have found this gem."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for what it serves which is border-town Mexican fast-food (tacos, burritos, caramelos, etc).  

The pricing is really good and the portions for what I've ordered are also good, granted I have ordered 3 types of items from their menu (caramelos, Sonora Dogs, and tacos), so I can't speak for their other dishes (burritos, etc).

Their staff is always friendly and quick; the gal at the counter seems like she's the Manager and she speaks both fluent English and Spanish and interacts with everyone in a welcoming manner... she and her staff make it a pleasant experience.

My favorite thing to get here.. when I'm up for something naughty to eat.. is the carne asada cramelo, small.. it's perfectly sized and I really enjoy the combo of buttered tortilla with cheese and well-seasoned beef inside.

You might be asking - \"so why only 3 stars?\"  Well, considering that I only eat here when I'm partially inebriated or hung-over... or have a hankering for a greasy, fatty, low-quality food... well, that sums it up.  The meat quality is pretty low, especially their Sonora Dogs which tase basically like FUD brand weiners that are made with every decomposable body part of the pig and or other creature.  But it's cheap, so what do you expect.  I guess I justify eating meat here with \"I don't come that often\"."}
{"text":"Why I won't return to this location. Upon ordering my takeout, I noticed the server had a shoulder full of white flakes from his scalp. I said, to the host as gently as I could, that he had dandruff. She sent him to the restroom to remove a full shoulder of this flakey scalp. I wasn't going to write this review until, picking up my order at the counter, the young woman insulted my intelligence. She said, FYI it wasnt dandruff it was lint. I will never eat at Moreno Express again. Watch who's serving you food."}
{"text":"At this place they give you complementary chips and salsa while you wait for your food. It's a lot bigger than the place in Chandler. I ordered the taco toro with tongue. It wasn't as soft and melts in your mouth as I remembered it, but it was good. I kind of wished there was a salsa bar like the other place in Chandler. The atmosphere was nice and it's a good place to have a group gathering. Friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food Place in Chandler! When I'm there I usually get the Tacos Toro with Beef and tongue. The beef tongue melts in your mouth and it's very flavorful! The place is small, but cute. It gets pretty busy at lunch time. You got to try the strawberry milk drink! Tasted like the Mexican ice-cream!"}
{"text":"The family, even the kids  liked the bean dip that accompanied the complimentary tortilla chips- and they usually don't touch bean dip!  The enchilada steak combo was tasty.  Service was good that Sunday evening."}
{"text":"I got a chicken burrito yesterday and I couldn't stop thinking about it all day today. They gladly substituted some ingredients for others at my request. And now I'm driving home with another couple orders for my wife and me. It smells so good I just want to tear into the bag. I'm going to finish this review after I've eaten it.... Same thing. Delicious."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.

They bring out chips and salsa.  You have a choice of 3.  Refried bean dip, hot red salsa, and green sweet salsa.  All of them are delicious.  I'll grap some hot, then sweet, then bean dip.  Definately wont be bored with the option.  Mix and match....hot, and beans....etc.  Yum!  Be adventurous!  Man! I could just sit here and fill up on chips and salsa.

The menu has tons of options.  They let you sub beans for corn or french fries. Thank God, as I hate refried beans.  I ordered the Special Chimi, my husband ordered  beef taco and chicken enchilado combo plate, and my daughter ordered 2 Street tacos.....fish and shrimp.  

Katies shrimp was cooked correctly.  Very fresh and the pineapple salsa really put it over the top.  It had a nice light creamy cheese.  The fish was crisp and light/flakey.   It had a light creamy sauce, diced tomatoes and shredded cabbage.  A little squeeze of lime gave it a nice tang.  Very impressed and 2 tacos were stuffed to the gills with goodies. She wasn't able to finish all of both tacos.  

My Special Chimi was outstanding.  It tasted like a cheese steak burger.  Carne Asada was a little tough but it was still tasty.  It was so stuffed with steak, I could only eat 1/4 of it.  French fries were nothing special-shoe string style and under cook.  Thats ok because I used them to dip into the spinage cheese sauce.  A mix between alfredo and mac-n-cheese sauce.  Light spinage taste but I would love to have this in slices to put on my burgers.  Rice is well....rice.  it was cooked right and was nice to mix with the cheese sauce.

My husband just loves this place.  We ALWAYS walk away stuffed and have leftovers for lunch (or midnight snack for the kiddo's....or doglll, if those rascals get the fridge door open again,lol.)

You cant go wrong with the place...chicken, beef, pork, seafood...a little something for everyone...even soups and salads.

Service was fast and excellent.  We have been here multiple times and I have to say that the staff is always on top of things."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on Saturday morning. Service was ok but not outstanding. Food came on time. Food was hot and served with good attitude. Portions were huge and tasty. Price reasonable."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and never once thought about stopping in.  That was until the other day someone at work had recommended this place.  Thank goodness for that recommendation.

The Sonoran dog is a must have.  Good ole Mexican street-style comfort food.  I had 2 but could of just as easily had 1.  This dog was piled high with pinto beans, bacon, pico de gallo, ketchup, mayo, mustard and all contained within a soft bun.  I'd be surprised if someone could eat one of these and not spill something.

I also had some chips and different salsas from the salsa bar.  Good chips and tasty salsas.  My only complaint was that the chips were a little too salty for me.  But I'm one who does not care for a lot of salt.

I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it.  The street-style tacos looked great and also had heard their tortas are wonderful too.  I'll save that for my next trip."}
{"text":"Love this place! Near our VFW so we often stop for dinner before. I love their carne asada burrito, no rice add guacamole. Definitely authentic, staff is cheerful and helpful. Prices are okay, huge portions though, my burrito is usually 2 meals. Food came quickly."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience at Moreno's was good, but not great. My biggest criticism is the food was pretty bland - from the salsa, to the shredded beef tacos, to the rice and beans, to the enchilada sauce (red and green).  Our server even warned me and hubby that the green sauce was \"really spicy\", but I didn't taste any spice. My favorite for Mexican food is Serrano's and it appears it will continue to be!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 tacos and a chile con queso appetizer with no drink and it cost me $18.  Was it good?  Well the carne asada is above average, and the street size fish taco was ok.  Their Queso Dip isn't anything special.  Personally to pay $3.99 each for crispy tacos, $2.99 for a mini taco and $6 for a small side of mediocre at best Queso seems a tad excessive.  I'll come back, but will be a little wiser with my selections next time!  The only salsa I personally found appealing was the green tomatilla variety.  All the others were bitter and had a weird taste to me!  Again on a positive note I would certainly recommend the carne asada any way you want it via tacos or burritos!"}
{"text":"I just moved to East Mesa. I love the Morenos on Mesa Drive and Broadway, used to be regulars there. So when I seen their opening a new Morenos we were very excited. After visiting the new location today we are very disappointed. First off it's not caf√© style like their other restaurant. Second the prices tacos are a bit much then the other Restaurant. Third I will say enjoy the chips and salsa and beans given to us but no salsa cart my favorite salsa was the creamy green salsa I always got tacos with that on the side. It was very clean and the staff was friendly but it wasn't the Morenos I know. My husband got the mini chimichangas no sauces only one choice of guac or sour cream very plain. We will be sure if we are craving our tacos to go back downtown. I hope they make some changes and make it like the Morenos in West Mesa."}
{"text":"Poor service and over priced for average food. More of a Taco Bell style of Mexican food. Staff is obviously young and does not have a clue as how business actually works.

I went, I ate and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I am very familiar with la frontera Sonora and the dudes down there that came up with this unbelievably simple delicacy known to all those lucky enough to have enjoyed what we call the hot dog estilo Sonora. I'll put down 4 of these darn things in one sitting runny green avocado sauce, lime, hot sauce, beens and bacon covering about 40 % of my body before I am done taking my last bite.  They make em good down south and almost as good at one of the 3 Morenos locations. The fresh baked rolls they use are to morir for. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they are expensive as hell in relation to their equal south of the border."}
{"text":"I paid $10 for a Torta with dried out bread and chewy beef.  Not much flavor either. Was better once I added mayo and their salsa (which is pretty good). The service was good.  I have been here a few times and food is usually pretty decent. Perhaps today was an exception but the fact that I paid so much, they need to get it right every time. I will probably not be back. It's just too expensive and the food even when it is good is not that good."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The service is outstanding and the prices are reasonable. I had the crab stuffed chile relleno, amazing! They bring out complimentary chips and salsa the bean dip does phenomenal. I highly recommend this place and they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"My husband had the taco combo, I had the chili relleno combo and a side shredded beef 
taco.   The was very good!  But two complaints, the tacos were on the cold side and they
do not serve salsa (with chunks) they only serve sauce (liquid like) with their chips.  The sauce is just okay.
So the only they lacking is chips served with a good SALSA.  :)"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and true Mexican food and great prices. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a New Mexican restaurant, but this is another Taco Bell Mexican place. 
The enchilada sauce was canned.  The rice was decent, but somewhat bland. Beans were most likely canned as well.  
Tamale was typical restaurant quality, but I was really craving one.... so I took a chance.
Asked for sauce and was charged $1.69 for a couple tablespoons of sauce. 
Will not be back.  This place may be good for people who do not know authentic Mexican food.  
The place was filled with people who were mostly Caucasian.  My Caucasian friends love Chipotle and places like this, so maybe they will do well by serving that clientele."}
{"text":"My wife and I really loved this place. Service was A+++. I even tipped the server 25% because they young man was so good and attentive!  The food was excellent and no complaints at all! It was a very enjoyable experience for our date night."}
{"text":"Glass in my margarita! 
My husband and I found this restaurant several months ago, and at first we loved it, but the last 2 times we had really bad experiences and the staff did not handle things very well.
My first sip of my house margarita I found a piece of glass in my mouth. I called the waiter over and told him about it, he said he would get me a new one. He did and then proceeded to charge us for them. No apology!
I saw the bartender slam an empty bottle into the garbage as she was making our margaritas and a piece of glass must have flown up into my glass. Why do bartenders slam empty bottles in the garbage? Ugh!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and got the spinach enchiladas. They were excellent and there was a large amount of food. The chips and salsas that started my meal were excellent. I'm a sucker for a nice thin, crispy tortilla chip and the bean dip in particular was really good also. 

I ordered one of each the cream sauce and the green. And I preferred the cream mainly because I are too much of the hot sauce and the cream sauce helped to cool down the heat. The sides were rice and corn so overall it was a very loaded plate. 

And they were fast. I was well fed and done in less than an hour and able to get back to my day. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Morenos! Prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty big. Everything is so flavorful and made right when ordered. The salsa bar has everything you'll need! Avocado salsa, a red salsa, cucumbers, jalape√±os with carrots and limes!! 

Do find yourself a table as soon as you walk in because this place tends to fill up rather quickly!!!!

Oh and you must try the carne asada caramelo!!! (Quesadilla with steak) Its AMAZING! (I get mine with no beans)"}
{"text":"Thank you Morenos!  Not only did we have a wonderful lunch (the baja tacos and chile verde were especially good!), but the staff located my forgotten purse and held it for me until I was able to return.  Great food, excellent staff, we are your newest loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Love all Moreno's and Gecko locations, never disappointed with the food. Having one walking distance from where I work is definitely a plus! The staff is always happy to help and smiling. I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Got the shredded beef burrito, and it was tasty but could have used some spices or something.  Some salsa helped, but it needed more.  The beef was tender and the flour tortilla was fresh.   It just needs something more.

The staff was friendly, and the wait time was reasonable.  I'd go back again and try something different next time."}
{"text":"The best Sonoran dogs in town! Amazing flavor, quick service, and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Not a fan.

Ordered delivery, it came quickly and food was still warm.  The chili rellano sauce was seperate which i looved.

But the food was just awful. Shredded beef taco was bland and dry.  I ended up throwing the rellano sauce on it, since i was not provided the hot sauce i requested.  I didn't get any hot sauce actually.  

The enchiladas were just bad.  I had Christmas sauce on them and it was soooo salty!  And i never found cheese.  Just rolled up tortillas.  

Second time ordering.  Won't do again.  So disappointing"}
{"text":"We usually go in, order and wait for our take out. We have not been disappointed yet. The food is good and the staff is friendly/helpful. I am thankful that by looking at yelp, I could order online and then pick it up--great!"}
{"text":"This place is good for some classic Mexican grub! The tacos are just like street tacos and I think we can all admit that street tacos are the only way to go! My husband got a chicken and bean burrito and that was delicious as well! Morenos is another Chandler classic, it's been there for as long as I can remember! I'm only giving the 4 stars because they forget to put salsa in your take out bags!"}
{"text":"I ordered a taco platter for a small party and they were a hit! We had no left overs. I got all carne asada with flour and corn tortillas. Both were super yummy. They provided plenty of toppings and salsas. I was really happy with the order. Ive eaten many other dishes here too and all their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Strange combination of ingredients in my to-go burrito somehow worked well at this mini Mexican chain. I originally had the carne asada from this place at the Ostrich Festival and it was super lean, so I went back to the well for this meal. Everything was great until my next to last bite where one fatty piece was located, but that won't be a deterrant for another future visit. This burro had jalapeno cream cheese, cheddar cheese, rice, carne and mango salsa. Clearly unusual, but it tasted fine, which is more than I can say for the overly greasy chips (check photo). I did not call in the order, but the food was ready quick, so it's kind of a fast food place, but also dine-in."}
{"text":"We walk in and and stand for a while and had to ask to sit down. The waiter rarely came to the table. We wanted a refill on chips and had to ask someone who didn't even wait at our table. He said he would bring them and I actually never saw him again.  Then had to ask our waiter who finally came over. Also,  while he showed up to refill the chips that we had to ask for, we decided to ask for more water because the cup was completely empty and we knew if we didn't ask we wouldn't have gotten the refill. One, because he never would have noticed and two, he might not ever show back up. 

My food was not good. I had the veggie burrito and there was so much tortilla and barely any veggie. I opened the burrito and just ate the inside which was about 4 scoops of food on my fork. 

My friends Moreno burrito was average,  but again had to much tortilla. 

Overall, the service was terrible and food was below average. I do not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"I hate to leave this review but it is needed.  Went in for a quick lunch (Sonoran hot dog) and it was anything but.  I was sat down by a friendly front desk person and then waited for my waiter.  When my waiter finally came and took my drink order (water) I asked about a few menu items which he did not know any answers to.  

Another 5 to 7 mins pass by and a girl came by and took my order which was very simple (Sonoran hot dog).  and then my original waiter came by asking to take my order 7 to 10 mins after that.  I asked him for a water refill and then my food came out and i asked the person who brought my food for a refill as well.. 

I waited another 15 mins, finished my lunch and still waited for my original water refill..  My waiter came by and I told him that i have still not had a water refill and would also like the check.  He comes back and drops the check and then left for another 4 or 5 mins, came back and brought water and took the check with him.  I sat another 10 or so mins waiting for him to return with my debit card so i could leave.  Another waitress stopped by and asked if I was ok and I explained I was still waiting on my check, 5 mins later my original waiter came back with it. 

I could completely understand if it was crowded but there were only 5 other tables sat at the time and it was far from busy.  My quick Sonoran hot dog lunch ended up taking me 45 mins from my arrival till departure.  Very slow service and I am highly disappointed why this.  The food was good, staff was friendly but it was Very slow.  Way to slow for something as simple as a Sonoran hot dog."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service. The food is good but not great. We always enjoy coming after church on Sundays."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Finding good Mexican food outside of Globe is hard!!!! Moreno's is in my opinion the best joint in the area. I love my refrigerator beans and am very picky about them too. Moreno's makes the best in the area, probably why my parents and myself are there weekly :) So happy that there is a clean, upbeat environment to get my fiesta on. The staff is always attentive and make our family feel very welcome. It's nice to feel like you are wanted vs being greater with an eye roll or cold shoulder. If you are in the mood for great Mexican food try it out."}
{"text":"This company thinks it's ok to purposely under pay employees on their checks! DO NOT EAT HERE!! I don't support companies who think they can strong arm young adults just because they are young and don't know how to defend themselves. Shame on Moreno's! I hope they change their practices in the future but word of mouth and social media will ruin them if they continue this. I will never support this company!"}
{"text":"Got some tacos and sonoran dogs from Morenos recently.

The pastor tacos were excellent.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The tortillas were okay.  Not the freshest but did the trick.

The carne asada meat was old and a bit stale.  Would have been nicer if it was grilled to order.

The sonoran dog was good.  Lots of topping with a nice soft bun.

I tried a few of the salsas and they were good."}
{"text":"This place okay for try out Mexican food, but kinda very expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants. I might stopping sometime try out some Mexican food, but it is not favorite place, and customer service is very nice with friendly waiters and waitresses. Try it out see if you liked? I am not highly recommend because of their expensive price!!!"}
{"text":"Really loved the lengua tacos and chumichangas. So much better then midst places. Went their to try the Sonora hot dogs and were very pleased. This is the second time coming but we will be regulars."}
{"text":"These guys make some really good Sonoran food and this is their original location. It all started with a small Hot Dog cart outside and now they are rocking throughout the valley with several locations.

Came here for the Sonoran Dogs and was not disappointed. They are made to perfection and the buns they use are delicious. It is hard not to eat at least a couple of dogs and maybe sneak down a third. Nice!

They have a giant menu with tons of the standard Sonoran favorites. The salsa bar is very fresh and you can load up with as much as you want. I like the fact that the salsas have some good flavor with a few having more heat than others.

Service is very friendly and on my first visit they took the extra time to explain the most popular items as well as their daily specials. The inside is also very clean and the food comes out rather quickly. Best part is that they are very close to my work. See ya there around lunchtime. I'll be the one with the big smile. ESTOY LISTO!

4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, bright, clean, variety of seating options, separate bar with seating (and outdoor).  We enjoyed our yummy fajitas, chimichanga and small chimichanga plates.  Beer cold frosted mug and margs hit the spot.  The chips comes with couple of salsas and a tasty bean dip.  We be back...a lot."}
{"text":"The food is always fabulous, not in a trendy in the moment way, but in an authentic - this is what my grandma used to make when I was little way. The ambience is pleasant and easy going. But our server Vanessa is amazing! There are few servers that we genuinely remember and return to an establishment for, but she is definitely worthy of being remembered ! She is knowledgeable, helpful and efficient . She stands apart from the rest !!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"To define a genuine Mexican street food is often to associate grease and fat over flavor, at least that's what I've been told by some of my dear Hispanic friends. This fast food joint elevates street comfort food to the next level, and by that, I mean favoring flavor over the mouthfeel of grease and fat.

First off, their seasoning and marinate on the cooked meat distract the tastebuds from the greasy aftertaste it leaves on the mouth, then reinforce them with the freshest vegies and tasty salsas, plus a sprinkle of lime, and there you have an explosion of flavor that makes me want to thank the Virgen de Guadalupe for being on the corner street a few blocks from where I go to church.

Lengua, lengua, lengua, try this taco and i'm telling you your tongue will be smiling in a magic carpet ride. The Soles can Chili Verde is a kickstart favorite too. For culinary delight in layers, I recommend the highly advertised Sonoran hotdogs, but please please don't eat it like you are in a hotdog eating contest - remember remember to satiate them in layers. Now to cap it off, wash all the goodness with their agua fresca, horchata or strawberry, is spot on delicioso."}
{"text":"Like many mexican places in some of the worst parts of town, this place has wonderful tasting food. It is like a hidden gem, I mean really super food. But the price is not very good... For example they have very good carne asada tacos, but at a dollar 69 that is not good value really. That should be about a dollar for literally as small as a baby's hand.. each taco is two bites, and absolutely delicious. . Give this place 3 stars because the food is good, the value not really."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp while out geocaching. 
Dinner was good and priced right. 
Wil be back if in area again."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT and EXCEPTIONAL food and service!  You won't leave here hungry....... The bean dip with the chips and salsa is SUPERB!! The Moreno's Burrito was wonderful and the Quesadilla Grande was almost perfect except......... kinda greasy.  Beautiful flavor though!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the 2nd time I ate here and it was just as good as the first time.  Their chicken quesadilla is delicious!  Shredded beef awesome. My husband had chicken street tacos and loved them.  We'll be back!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is amazing. I recently moved to Chandler from San Diego. My family and I went here in a whim and we have not regretted it!! I've ordered several different things off the menu and I have loved everything so far! I challenge you to find something you don't like about their food. We came here for my birthday dinner (although it wasn't acknowledged through the restaurant) it was a great time! Their service could use some work, since most of their wait staff are young teenagers but their food really makes up for it. Their chips and salsa are addicting! Nice little setting, you could sit inside or out and enjoy a cold one  Give this place a chance, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So this is a decent neighborhood Mexican joint. The food is pretty good and the price point seems about right. Have visited quite a few times with the family and the kids really likes it. 

The good:
The bean dip is yummy. They also provides two different types of salsa. The usual red, and a sweet green salsa. I like most of everything I have tried. I like the different variety of meats they offer, including lengua. I wish they had cabeza.

The bad:
Limited seating. Outside tables are bolted down, so you can't combine them if you have a larger party. Also, if you sit inside next to the patio door, the patio door slams every time a server goes in and out and it's bound to drive you nuts eventually. 

The ugly:
Ordered the crab relleno last night. I was all excited cuz Abuello's used to have this dish called crab mazanillo that's basically a fancy crab relleno. It was my favorite dish until they took it off the menu. Anyhow, so I was looking forward to trying it out at this place. Well, guess what? It's not even real crab. They stuffed it full of fake crab. So it just became a breaded and fried chile full of fake crab. I ate maybe 1/3 of it before I gave up. It just didn't taste good and it really didn't make me want to keep eating it. Honestly I would've been happy to pay a little more for real crab. And they really shouldn't lie to customers and say it's crab when it's \"krab\". I'm more irritated at the dishonesty than anything else because we like the place. 

In conclusion: Don't order the \"crab\" relleno. Everything else so far has been decent."}
{"text":"Tasty food, quick service, affordable.  I had the Santa Fe Burrito which was very tasty.  Nothing overpowered any other flavor so it was perfect blending.  The burritos are large and could easily be two meals.

The red salsa is pretty good but I loved their green salsa so much more.  Sweet with a kick.  I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place because they have some authentic dishes. I especially like the tacos. I have to take a couple of stars off though because if you go and they are approaching busy there is quite a bit of congestion at the door, the salsa bar, and the register. It really is a fire code violation. The seating could be updated and depending on your luck you could get a lopsided booth or table. Lastly pray you are lucky and have a salt shaker and napkins at your table. Food is top notch, the overall experience leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"3 Stars because the food is excellent- to bad the service isn't. Management needs to rethink on staff help. It's very difficult to even consider leaving a tip. Seriously."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is the worst service I have encountered in a really long time...I'm a server, so it takes a lot for me to say this. Service sucked AND Has ALWAYS sucked. My son loves this place so, I come here often and share fajitas with him and my boyfriend. It takes me everything I have not to get up and start serving myself lol."}
{"text":"It's pretty good place to eat it's not as good as the original location but hopefully it gets to that point soon. They recently just expanded the building and now have a bar inside as well"}
{"text":"First time here, Restaurant was clean, 
Waiters that served us was nice but she needs to be retrained. 
She kept on disappearing ,
We had to wave her down a few times and ask for some more chips and water.
The Menudo was salty !
Maybe the second time we go food and service will improve !
A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently moved in this area and Moreno's has been our family go to place.  Food is very good and consistent.  The bean dip they serve with chips when you're seated is Excellent. Our family eats the complimentary bowl in minutes.  There is a charge to have a second bowl but it is worth it. We have been very happy eating here and recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped by the food truck for a try. Great food. They are testing the location around Main Street and Power. I hope this works out. This was our first taste. We will certainly try another location too. Great hot dog and street tacos. The salsa was a great addition. Loved it."}
{"text":"New place and already expanding. Love the Sonoran dog, street tacos and tamales. Drop by for some great food. Yum"}
{"text":"I went to Moreno's with a coworker and her son on Friday night. We spent forever waiting for our food and it was not even good. The chips weren't salty, the bean dips were cold, the server forgot to put our order in, and they forgot to give us our to-go order. My mango shrimp quesadilla was different temperatures-- cold mango salsa, room temperature shrimp, and melted cheese. No flavor either. I was excited for a new Mexican restaurant in the area but am disappointed that it was not all it could be."}
{"text":"Great food . . . love their shrimp cocktail !!! Clean, good service and very friendly help. Some of the very best Mexican food I've had in AZ.  Save some room for their deep fried ice cream . . . unreal !!! Also stays open until about 11:00 pm (?) . . . great for a late night snack. One of these visits I need to try one of their Hotdogs . . . supposed to be excellent."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've been here twice now with the wife. And both times we really liked the food. Elmer's is pretty much right next door. This place seems much cleaner, organized and professional. They have great tortas too. They have Sonoran hot dogs here... Fair warning...I've never had the original from Tucson...but these babies are pretty good with everything on them."}
{"text":"Eat here 3-4 times a month.  Service is always good, staff friendly and the food consistently good.  Coupons via text and in print ads - a discount just adds to the goodness."}
{"text":"Moreno's is a staple in the ghetto part of Mesa.  It's the type of place you go when you're craving some good, greasy Mexican food, and don't particularly mind the thought of getting mugged or having your car stolen.  This place might not win awards, but in the realm of hole-in-the-wall Mexican, they are at or near the top.

Of course they're known for having Sonoran dogs.  Their Sonoran dogs are a reasonable facsimile of what you'd find in Tucson, but if you're expecting it to be as good as El Sinaloense Hot Dog Cart, you'll be disappointed.  This is simple a satisfy-your-craving type of Sonoran dog.

While I usually grab a dog or two when I'm there, where they really shine is their tacos.  They have, of course, the boring carne asada, etc. that most gringos like, but they also have pretty good lengua tacos, and their tripa tacos are phenomenal (I have a very hard time convincing any of my white-bred compatriots to try the tripe tacos, but seriously, people: if you like bacon, you'll love the tripe tacos).

They do have much of the standard Mexican fare... Burritos, etc.  They have horchata, jamaica, etc.  I usually prefer to stick with the bottled sodas: Jarritos, Manzana, and my personal favorite, the Mexican Coke in 16-oz bottles.

Writing this is actually making me really crave one of those tripe tacos."}
{"text":"I've taken my family twice now, but I don't think we'll be going back unless something changes. Greasy chips, bland salsa. Fajitas lacked seasoning, and the accompanying guacamole and pico were flavorless. All washed down with a tepid Coors Light. I'd rank this place somewhere between Taco Bell and a gas station burrito. The waitress stopped back only once, and that was to offer up dessert. Pity, I've heard good things about the other locations."}
{"text":"It was a good place to eat! Staff was okay, weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude to us either. I got the carne asada burrito and it was pretty good! The only thing I wish they'd have are refillable drinks."}
{"text":"Moreno's is a mobile food truck, err trailer, that has taken up residence on the Southeast corner of Main Street and Power Road in Mesa.  The truck/trailer combo is somewhat hard to miss.  There are bright, scrolling and blinking signs affixed to the side of a colorfully painted 6 wheeled trailer attached to an equally colorful box truck adorning the Moreno's name.  It beckons for your attention as if to say, \"Come and look here.  We've street tacos, grilled meat and Mexican food.\"

Just like a moth is drawn to a bright light, so are people to this mobile, scaled down version Moreno's Restaurant.  And it drew me in too!  Driving by, I first saw the truck and trailer setup along Power Road and Main Street with people standing at the window and taking food away.  Several days later, I saw that it had moved to the southern side of the parking lot and had taken up camp in front of a vacant business making for a bit less chaotic arrangement with easier access.

The setup is really quite nice for a mobile food business.  Right next to the food truck, there is a large patio area that has several tables with umbrellas and folding chairs for dining al fresco - they even play music to drown out the traffic noise while you dine.  In the evening, the patio is lighted with hanging retro style string lights above the tables in the dining area.  There is also a mini salsa bar that has two tomato based salsas, one is mild, one is medium heat with a slight roasted flavor and one creamy avocado based salsa, plus fresh sliced cucumber, lime wedges and pickled carrots with onions and jalapenos; they even have small to go cups for salsa and plastic bags for jalapenos if you are getting takeaway.  

The menu is presented on a flat screen TV and currently consists of Burritos, Tacos (street style: small soft corn tortillas), Tortas (a toasted bolillo roll with lettuce, avocado and Pico de Gallo - think of a warm, burger-like sandwich), Caramelos (melted white Mexican cheese and meat in between two crispy griddled flour tortillas - think quesadilla that is not folded) and Vampiros (a crispy corn tortilla with meat, chopped onions and fresh cilantro - think tostada, no cheese, no lettuce) all made with your choice of meat.  

Meat choices are Asada (grilled garlic & lime marinated beef), Al Pastor (chili & pineapple marinated grilled pork), Tripas (boiled & grilled intestine), Cabeza (roasted beef head), Cecina (marinated & dried beef), Lengua (braised beef tongue) and Pollo Asada (grilled citrus marinated chicken).  Also offered: Sonoran Hot Dogs (a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with pinto beans, onions, mayonnaise, mustard and salsa in a split bolillo roll).

Although the menu shows just six items, once you consider the choices of meat fillings and the various forms of roll or tortillas, simple math will dictate nearly 40 different menu offerings; enough to keep you coming back to find that perfect combination. 

The food is tasty, freshly made and reasonably priced.  The Burrito and Caramelo are filling, as is the Torta.  The Tacos will need to be in multiples to be equally filling but, nonetheless, they are tasty on their own.  The meats are tender, not too fatty, juicy, and have flavor.  The cheese in the Caramelos is quality, flavorful, gooey and plentiful.  The proportions of condiments, ingredients and seasoning all seem to be in proper ratios too; customize it with the addition of the tasty salsas and you will have a mouthwatering combination.

The service is prompt and friendly and the staff is happy to explain menu items to you.  Once you place your order and pay, if you are eating there, you are given a number to place on your table and your food is delivered to you.  Also offered are bottled water and Mexican & American soda.  Credit cards are accepted too.  If you are in a hurry, you can call ahead to order, and because Moreno's is located in the parking lot of a shopping center, parking is plentiful and pickup is breeze.

Overall, Moreno's Food Truck is a satisfying and delicious option for quick-serve Mexican food.  I have noticed that they are now parked and open for business earlier in the day, for lunch, and some days will go well into the night, so long as there are customers ordering food.  Given Moreno's humble beginnings as a hot dog cart, and now their multiple brick and mortar restaurants, I know that their success will be assured as they certainly have the experience to do so.  So long as Moreno's keeps it fresh, high quality and simple, people will only continue to flock here - especially if they keep this location (for the dining area alone).  My one suggestion: offer a dessert option - Churros or Fried Ice Cream or Flan . . . or all three!

{"text":"Been here before always superior service and food; best in town! I would recommend this place to anyone hosting family or out of town visitors -wayne ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been a Moreno's customer since they day they opened. 

When it opened, the restaurant was pretty very awkward. It was confusing if you were supposed to sit down, walk up and order, bus your own plates. It made the restaurant uncomfortable.

However, the food was fantastic. I used to live across the street from the restaurant and ate their a few time a week. The poritions were large and everything I ate was great. Chicken, cabeza, lengua, all fantastic. Asada was not the best, but it was still good. The salsas were good, but nothing memorable. Rice and beans were always delicious. Even the shrimp burrito was tasty.

Everything was great for the first year or so of the restaurant.

Recently they have made some refinements and it is just not as good. While they have removed the akwardness from the restaurant, they have reduced portion sizes and raised prices. 

Still a good restaurant, but not like it used to be.

Drinks are still VERY cheap at Moreno's. It was always hard for me to leave without knocking back a few Dos Equis."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Morenos.  The taco toro is so delicious!!!  We order it every time.  My sister always orders the sonoran dog and raves about it."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to Moreno's. First time we've ever been and didn't even eat there. Why? Because we sat for 10 minutes. No one greeted us, brought us water nothing. Service here sucks big time. They didn't seem to care that we were there. We finally just left."}
{"text":"Nice and clean inside. Fast and friendly service. I love the sonoran hot dogs. I've never had them anywhere else before so I'm not sure how they measure up to other places but there pretty darn grub at Moreno's. I've had the burritos, tacos (fish, chicken and carne asada) and vampiros and love them every time. Salsa is delicious too. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"If you like food seasoned with half a can of salt then this is your place. If you like your food being served to your husband and your kid and wait 30 minutes for your plate, then this is the place for you! The cashier was so apologetic and gave me a desert for free to try to make up for it at least. But Id expect WAY better for $45. At this rate and flavor, Filiberto's or Taco Bell would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"This place is a little different from Mexican Food eateries that I am familiar with.  There is more seafood on the menu.  We ate there last night with friends.  I had the chili relleno with red enchilada sauce.  The sauce was very good.  The relleno was soggy .  I would not order that again.  One of the people in our group had a cheese enchilada which he said was very good.  Two people had the beef chimichanga.  The meat wasn't shredded enough which made it harder to cut and eat.  The flavor was good.  The music here is so loud that the people taking orders (walk up and order) can't hear a customer very well and vice versa.  The restaurant itself is attractive and pleasant.  I guess I'd go back and try something different."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan but they gave me the worst service today. I saw a sign that they were hiring cooks so I should have figured they were understaffed but I didn't think that meant they'd be incompetent. Completely messed up my order and my food was cold. Don't waste your time there are plenty of delicious hot dog or Mexican restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Would have to say the staff is pretty shabby and the manager there is very rude! He has no courtesy for the customers (he's the one with the abscess on his eyelid).... asked for a refill and he said \"wait a minute would ya\" then another time I was there i had an issue with their iced tea (tasted fishy). The young lady we had for a waitress told Mr. Eyelid.... he shook his head and came over with another drink(soda) and said the tea is fine but heres another drink for you. He just has an edge too him that is rude and not customer friendly! Just trying to inform anyone that the food is pretty solid but the service and drinks are questionable especially mr eyelid!"}
{"text":"The price is double most fast food Mexican type places. 30 bucks for 4 tacos and 2 small drinks. Food is good but not worth that"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service at all. I went in for take out. Order my food at 635pm, very simple Carne asada gecko quesadilla  and 2 tacos and chips and salsa. Said 15-20 min wait ok. Someone else comes in 3-4 min after I did order and his order was ready before mine and his order was large order of food. I ask for mine they give mine after 30 plus min and not only was the order wrong but cold. So not happy with this place at all!!"}
{"text":"The positive reviews of this place are a mystery to me. As I always do, I odered a fish taco because it's what I use to compare Mexican places. In this case it was a Baha fish taco because it's it stated that it had a \" Baha sauce\". It's almost always some sort of white sauce that brings it all together. These had NO  sauce whatsoever. It was like eating sawdust!  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Loved it! I got a burrito with grilled green chili chunks on it, with the mixta meat and hubs got a burrito with mixta meat with all the typical goodies, both were large and deliciously fresh. Friendly and attentive employees."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location (maybe any Moreno's?) and will probably be our last.  The service seemed awfully slow for a Thursday evening with few customers in the restaurant, but many visible employees.  Not the worst Mexican food we've had, but far from the best. Everyone in our group described it as 'just ok'.  Perhaps it was just an off night, but with so many better choices around, I don't see us choosing Moreno's again."}
{"text":"Great local option close by for Mexican food that we have enjoyed several times.    Tonight we were especially impressed with our server, Hunter,    He was very friendly, attentive and eager to make sure we had a wonderful meal.   Our food was delicious, prices good and location convenient.    Their new location in Gilbert is usually very busy so at times we have taken food to-go but tonight we got lucky with a comfy booth.    The decor is casual with crowded tables in the center making it feel a bit cafeteria-ish but the benefits of the food, service, prices and location make Moreno's a great spot."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am Mexican. (This should tell u  something, aaand should sum it up.) Now I have been here 3 times, had their Shrimp cocktail (twice) and it was delicious!!! Also had the sonoran hot dog and it was also delish!!! Im on my way back now to try some tacos..stay tuned... 

I did also try their Carne asada tacos, they were good also! This place is legit!!! Remember, If you see mexican/latin ppl in a Mexican restaurant YOU know it's Good for SURE! lol"}
{"text":"Moreno's certainly deserves its props in Oaktown for being a pretty damn good Mexican restaurant in Tempe. It's great to know that in a city flooded in the market of \"berto's\" style fast Mexi-food, there are some places that want to show it's customers a little bit more! 

Here are a few tips when eating here:

1. GET THE CHIPS! Seriously, they are fantastic - and they are probable the best chips I've had at a Mexican restaurant.

2. The salsa bar is great, but do yourself a favor and order salsa from the back. It is the best salsa in the whole restaurant guaranteed.

3. Their torta plates are tasty (especially the adovada), filling and cheap! 

4. Make sure you relate yourself with the daily specials, they have some great deals!

If you're by ASU and want some Mexican food, Moreno's is a sure thing."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite Mexican food in AZ. Chicken mango quesadilla, Shrimp tacos, enchiladas, fresh chips and salsa, among other things are some of our favorite things to order. The quality of meat here is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night. Place seemed em;pty at first, but filled up during dinner. It took forever to get a waiter to take our order. The owner just stood in the front not doing much of anything. They had 2 staff taking orders. When our order finally arrived , the burrito I ordered was filled with dry little cubes of meat. The ingredients weren't mixed well. I ate about 1/2 of it,,before it became unappetizing.  I could't get it taken off the bill as I'd eaten more than 1/2. The food was all in all very poor, along with the service."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food in Tempe is very hard (impossible?) to find. Generally it requires a trek to Phoenix or Mesa to find the good stuff. When someone told me the old Devil's House had turned into a new mexican place, I was there that very night to try it for dinner.

I brought along my friend who grew up in Yuma just like I did. We may be white boys, but we consider ourselves Mexican food experts. The one thing we have been looking for is good street tacos. In Yuma, there is at least 50 taco stands around the small city all serving up amazing tacos for around $1 each. The closest we've found around here is Mickey's in Mesa (a small hot dog place with great street tacos). 

Upon entering, the layout is a little weird. It looks nice like a sit-down place, but there is a big counter to go up and order. There is a salsa bar that my friend quickly examined. He said it was a good sign. Two kinds of salsa, creamy guac (the real mexican kind, not the chunky american kind) and an assortment of your standard taco toppings. 

We both got the carne (I got three tacos, my friend got the burrito). From the first bite, we could tell this place was a keeper. Big portions, juicy and very tasty meat. The salsa was perfect. I got the plate, so I got beans and rice as well. The beans were good but nothing special... The rice though, was amazing. I could eat a pound of it I think. 

The prices are average (I think I paid about $7, and my friend about the same). My friend also got a horchata, which he said was amazing. 

All in all, I'm just happy to have an actual good mexican food place to go to in Tempe now. It was pretty dead inside at dinner time, so I hope it can make it. Lets support this place and keep it around folks!"}
{"text":"Since this location opened this has been my favorite Mexican place. I've tried something different the 5 or 6 times I've been and loved them all. The crab relleno and shrimp chimichanga are particular favorites."}
{"text":"One thing you should take in mind: this is not like the other locations. They do not have the guacamole crema or self serve salsa bar. I got two adobada quesadillas and the adobada had no seasoning. It taste like plain pork. I have no idea if the flavor is absent to cater to the locals it if they just made a mistake. They also don't have varying sizes in tacos or quesadillas like the other locations. Paid $30 for something that was worth $10 in taste. Please do yourself a favor and go to the other two locations on Ray or Broadway."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, every single time when trying to place an order via phone left on hold for 30+ minutes or simply hung up on, take-out orders are wrong, 8/10 times you receive the wrong food, lots of business loss as my family and friends will no longer eat here or ever attempt to place a take-out order, lots of other awesome Mexican restaurants around this area with excellent customer service and who can correctly get orders right and with better food"}
{"text":"Excellent, classic AZ/Sonoran Mexican food - which is total comfort food for this Arizona native. We've been 3 times and every time the food and service were great. 

Salsa, chips and bean dip are really good to start. The chips are fresh and warm. Green salsa is on the sweeter side (which we like) and the bean dip is super yummy. 

I had a shredded beef taco and red cheese enchilada with beans and rice. The taco was SO good - huge and the shell was obviously freshly made in house. I also really like their red enchilada sauce, flavorful without being too spicy or bitter. Beans and rice are very good - again, lots of flavor but not overwhelming - if you like your food super hot, this might not be the place for you.

Husband had the crab stuffed chili relleno and let me have *one* taste. Delish. The cilantro / green sauce is amazing. He also had a fish taco and wouldn't share it at all - so it must have been really, really good. 

Very friendly service each time we've visited. They're in the process of adding space to the restaurant as well as a roomy outdoor patio. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised when we finally tried this place.  We had been by a couple of times at lunch and it was pretty empty so we did not stop thinking that was a bad sign.  We needed to find dinner on a Saturday night, they were not overly busy, but not empty either.  The service was pretty quick and attentive.  Mostly very young people working there , but they were all moving quickly with purpose.  We had the enchilada and carne asada.  The enchilada was good, the carne asada was tender, but no real flavor.  Took it home, seasoned it up and made a carne asada omelette for breakfast and that was great.  The Moreno's Burrito with green sauce was very flavorful and very large.  It's great to know this is an option for a good quick casual dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! The bean dip was delicious! I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and they actually put more than one scoop in! I was impressed! The pollo fundido wasn't as impressive. Garcias' tastes better."}
{"text":"I was bored and hungry on tour, found this place thanks to my Yelp app, and decided to go for a walk in the hot Arizona sun for a Corona and a burrito. 
Fast, friendly service. Decent food. I couldn't pick up my burrito because it came out on my plate already split underneath. Luckily I'm the type of person who doesn't mind if he has to eat his burrito with a fork an knife. 
I ordered the \"mix\" meat burrito which was consisted of chicken, pork, and beef. About half way through my burrito, I realized there was little chopped up bits of hot dog in the meat mix...weird. I saw Mexican hot dogs as an item on their menu but didn't think they would make their way into my burrito. But it was good, so of course I continued to eat it. 
No free chips and salsa, although there was an open salsa bar with a really good salsa verde along with other salsas and hot sauces, jalapenos and carrots and onions, limes, and even cucumber. 
Oh and the $2 coronas all day every day is always a plus. 
All in all, it was decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there to eat. Maybe to drink though :)"}
{"text":"Our friends who are major Mexican food eaters told us to check this place out.  I had the Grande Burro with grilled chicken...I truly think it's the best burrito I've ever had...like ever!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Fast and easy. There was a little argument between two of the staff while they cleaned the booth next to us, so that was a little awkward, but they cleaned up quickly and went into the back."}
{"text":"Just left Morenos now.
We ordered Chicken Fajita Burrito and a Chicken fundito burrito.
Pitiful small portions of salsa though chips were thin and good. Same amount of chips whether one person or 6. No extras unless you pay for more. 
Food was ample but am rating with 2 stars for offering more salsa in 4 oz cups but not chips.
Also I was told that the Fundito was enchilada style with green sauce and it came dry only cheese and sour cream.
They brought a pitiful 4 oz side of sauce but added $1.99 to bill. I have oral cancer and needed enchilada sauce but to have 25% more tacked on angered me.
Will not be back."}
{"text":"HOT DOG!!! I was turned on to this place from a fellow yelp-er, complaining about another joint I was at last week, the Sonoran Hot Dog is all I have had here. Very good."}
{"text":"I've been looking for quality, authentic Mexican food since I moved to AZ and until now, nothing really did it for me. I stumbled on this place by chance and figured I'd give it a try. 
The decor and ambiance makes you feel like you're in Mexico. From the music playing to the rustic art hanging on the wall, and most importantly, because of the food. 
The tacos are of small portions but with enough steak to make 2 of their tacos. I ordered 2 but essentially got 4. The steak was perfectly cooked and tasted unlike the other restaurants I've tried - delicious. I couldn't contain myself from the excitement that I finally found what I was looking for, I had to write a review immediately. 
If you're looking for a non chain operated authentic restaurant, this is the place for you. I highly recommend and will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Saw the lunch menu n ordered the enchiladas special.
 The menu advertising the specials clearly shows it comes w sour cream. The cashier and manager argued w me that it was wrong and 2 oz of sour cream is $2 more. NO, ur sign says its included!!! Manager would not honor  it or own her mistake. Sorry customer service as we all know that if u advertise something, u are to honor it.  I'm gonna go ahead n judge here becuz this place was empty at noon at lunch time. So im assuming food sucks too. Carolinas on country club was packed!!! Think I'll go w carolinas next time!"}
{"text":"Went for karaoke.  I thought the service was good. Enjoyed the chips and salsa, the Tampique√±a and the margaritas.  Was a good environment to hang out with friends and family and to let the kids sing."}
{"text":"Everything was very tasty, the staff was very friendly, and the resturant was very clean. I highly recommend this resturant to anyone looking for mexican resturant that isnt just another generic place. Very unique"}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada tacos with corn tortillas and the perfect salsa bar with plenty of cucumbers"}
{"text":"Went to Moreno's with my husband tonight for dinner. We chose Moreno's since we had a buy one get one coupon. I was pleasantly surprised at how great it was. We were there during their happy hour so our meal started off with discounted margaritas and the complimentary chips, two types of salsa, and beans. Gotta say that was a plus right away. Staff was super friendly. I ordered the street tacos. They were really yummy. The tacos were filled with lean shredded beef. My husband got the crab chile relleno and said it was really good. Overall it was a great experience. We went for the coupon tonight, but we will definitely go back for the food."}
{"text":"This is a small mexican restaurant that has its stuff together.  very well prepared food, great service and clean.  I recommend the Moreno's Burrito with asada and red sauce, delicious!"}
{"text":"I usually love Morenos in chandler!! I went to gilbert location this morning. I had con queso and chips that were good. Then, I had  the shrimp /mango quesadilla. Not only did this meal not have all ingredients the menu said it had, the shrimp tails still had poop in them and the first bite tasted like San Pedro wharf!! The tortilla was so soggy!! What a disappointment. Had the coupon in the mail so my whole family was excited to go. Would def never order shrimp or this dish ever again."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Shrimp is always not cleaned!! YUCK!! Be better off and just go somewhere else. Food ok, but doesn't make up for lazy service. Got our to go  order wrong again. :("}
{"text":"This place is really clean, including the bathrooms which isn't common at Mexican restaurants. I like that you can pick where you want to sit. Its a little small but the service is fast and friendly. The food is the best! I love Mexican food and I'm always trying new places and this is by far the best. The prices are a little more than I'm used to but I'm okay paying that because the food is fresh and hot and the place is clean, service is great, and the bean dip is so good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food...but they need to update their menu pricing. Website + downloadable PDF are not accurate - check for price increases if visiting."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this location after it opened at least once a week. It was our go to for good, fresh, clean Mexican food. However it went down hill in the last 5 months or so. It used to be a lot cleaner, now the tables and floor are always dirty. The service is slow unless you order at the register. The patio was so dirty last time it smelled like rotten food and after waiting approx 20 minutes for a server we just got up and left. No one even noticed and they only had about 4 tables full inside so it's not as if they were busy. Won't go back for a while, maybe they will get their act together."}
{"text":"The Fiesta Burrito (chicken) is very good and I highly recommend it to everyone! We always order takeout and it is fresh and promptly made!"}
{"text":"Ordered the menudo and it was cooked perfectly and if if you have ever eaten menudo before you know what I'm talking about. The meat was prepared flawless and was delicious. They also had a side of cabbage finely chopped and I have never had that as a add in, it's usually onions, cilantro, and limes. The cabbage was a nice touch.

I seen a lot of plates pass by and the all looked delicious. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews just because but this place has done me wrong and over charge me. I called in an order for carne asada burritos. When I went to pick the order the total was not what I expected. I asked why is it so much when I just order 3 carne asada burritos. The total was over $24 not including the tax. I explained to the person that each carne asada burritos priced on line $4.99. I left there upset and refused the order. They were not nice and didn't have an explanation to why the total was over $15. I look at the website which clearly says burritos $4.99 and it list all the meats. Also, it says add beans and rice $1.99. Which clearly says add on. I didn't order to add bean and rice. I order carne asada burritos. Never had I said with bean or rice. What made it even more frustrating is they could not explain why it cost more. They even didn't offer to reduce the price for there mistake. Not good customer service. So disappointed"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant,  this location and Chandlers are my favorites.   Love the caramelos (carne asada quesadillas) Carne Asada legit no bull!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't believe any of the positive reviews left. Food is basically Don Miguel frozen entrees. If you like food that taste like it's out of jar without any flavor; then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Been to many Mexican restaurants in the Phoe nix area, over the years. Haven't really found one that could be called outstanding. This place is no exception!...average food at best, just slightly above Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos around! My husband and I go here frequently to grab tacos and beer. I love that they do their own thing and do taco specials on Wednesday's instead of Tuesday's!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in forever food is way over priced now and not that great got special chimi girl said had cream cheese jalapeno spinach sauce it tasted like Velveeta cheese so not worth the price very disappointing everything way too pricey for what you're giving well not be returning. There's way better sonoran hotdog spots that don't charge you an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"For several consecutive trips, food order was wrong. AGAIN. They say they check the orders, they don't. Eggs ordered over-med, they were raw in center. Vegetarian order of no meat on burrito, they add bacon. Had to trip all the way back. While we waited again, the Mngr sat in a booth and fed himself, never addressed the issue on his own. BE WARNED, they also recently started charging for salsa. Mngr states salsa doesn't come with burritos per policy and charged $1.39 per 5oz cup!  If money is tight and you have to hang customers out with salsa charges, address the smell of cleaning chems first that smack you when u walk in. So hard to want to eat and stay because it smells like a bathroom no matter where you sit."}
{"text":"This was the exact restaurant we were looking for as we just moved to the area. Every bite was delicious. Chips & dips were yummy, tamales, shrimp quesadilla & street tacos were awesome. We even had left overs from the lunch portions. Server was friendly and service was quick. Great lunch spot! Definitely going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Flavorful Mexican at a decent price, what more could you want! I normally stick with the carne asada taco plate on flour tortillas which comes with a hefty side of rice and beans ($8). I attempted a chicken taco at one point and the juice's seeped through the tortilla in no time making it very hard to eat! The salsa is medium and definitely has a kick so shoot for the guacamole if you don't do well with spicy. At the register there is a loyalty sign up machine which offers freebies for each check in (1st time is a free drink). I haven't had a chance to try the hotdog stand out front, but I'll surely be back!"}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced for essentially a mediocre fast food (ok it's definitely not fast, but you order at the counter) restaurant where the staff seems confused about what they're supposed to do. 

$16 for a quesadilla and a fountain drink is a bit much, and the edges of the quesadilla were dried out, and it wasn't even cut all the way through."}
{"text":"Don't go here. I got tacos and I had asked for soft but had made me hard tacos which was fine and I had said I could pay for them and a the soft ones I wanted as well but they said I didn't need to. After those were done I took them home without opening to check (bad on my part) and they were awful. It looked like they had thrown around the box. The rice and beans were all over the tacos and the taco filling wasn't even inside the tortillas. I drove back down there and they proceeded to argue and accuse me of shaking the box. It was about a 5 minute argument before they finally decided to remake my bullied tacos. I made sure to watch them the whole time to make sure they wouldn't spit in my food. The employees here need to learn to not give attitude to customers and learn respect. I have been here so many times before but they have lost my business."}
{"text":"Supporting local business and grubbing on some seriously bomb Mexican food is what I'm all about. This place is great.  Friendly service, great food, convenient location. Moreno's is my new hometown pride food truck stop because Filiberto's is overrated in my book these days. Moreno will give me my classic burro in carne asada to pollo to lengua... Check it out! This spot is a worthy Mexican spot"}
{"text":"The food is so good, the staff is so nice, the location is awesome!  They even deliver!

The food here is authentic and fresh.  The staff is very friendly.  There is a huge choice of food and a lot of different types of meat, but it is also vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Best sweet corn tamales ever!! Yummy!!
Both the soft and crispy tacos were excellent & they have VERY affordable catering menu. This is our go to for party food."}
{"text":"Small quiet place for a late lunch. The corn was great. We had the street tacos. Yum. I do not recommend the tortilla soup  it was a bowl of mush \"noodles\" probably the worst tortilla soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased because I've loved Gecko Grill for years, and as I understand, they're owned by the same family. 
My life was ruined, RUINED I tell you, when they closed the Gecko on Gilbert road and Guadalupe.  They did open it up later on, up at baseline and greenfield but I live on the SE border of Gilbert, it was so far away that I rarely got to go. 
So I tried the Moreno's in Queen Creek, (which... Queen creek is irritating to me in general), and having some of the same food kind of gave me my fix, but that place was always slammed and not quite the same, and it just didn't quite fill the void in my life.  Or maybe my heartbreak was still too fresh. IT WAS TOO SOON. 
But then, oh happy day, they built this Moreno's and opened it and made me the happiest of women. 
I didn't want to go during opening week.  You CANNOT judge any establishment by opening week, and I didn't want to start the relationship out on rocky footing. 
We waited until tonight, and oh how glorious!  How poignant and sweet!   The food' to die for!  The chips so warm and light and crisp!  The cheese crisp so gooey on top and crunchy on bottom! The salsa and bean dip! Oh glory! 
I had the Pollo Fundido- piping hot, golden crisp on the outside, steamy soft and tender on the inside with hot steamy white chicken breast and some delectable sauce.  Other dishes had at our table were the fried shrimp platter... mini beef chimis... the special chimi with spinach queso sauce... the spinach enchiladas, and a steak-topped taco salad... 
it was all so good.  
The manager stopped by to chat and I got a little twitterpated and verklempt.  I told her how deeply I'd been hurt by the Gilbert/Guad Gecko closure... and she sent out a complimentary queso and chips... the angel.  
I love this place. My new home-away-from-home."}
{"text":"Vampiros y Tacos y Caramelos, oh my! Some of the best Sonoran food in town. There is a reason it's packed full every night."}
{"text":"This is a nice cross between a \"Garcia's sit down and a \"Filiberto's\" grab and go. They have an extensive menu selection, you may have a hard time deciding what to get. The salsa's and bean dips that come with the chips taste very fresh and unique. The wait staff we have both times were very attentive and pleasant. The only down side for me was my son ordered bean burro and the first bite made the bottom explode and squirted all the contents out. They were kind enough to make him a new one, which did the same thing. :) All in all, worth a visit. They even have fried ice cream, which is a plus with kids."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Chimi Special, grilled chicken covered in a cheese sauce, came with rice, beans and shredded lettuce on the side. Couldn't eat the whole thing. Took the rice and beans home!  Excellent! My third time here and all very good!"}
{"text":"Pretty average place. Small menu. Nothing too exciting. I totally missed the Sonoran Hot Dog until after I had ordered, so I may goo back and give it a try.

We had the flautas and fish tacos. Both came with refried beans and rice. Just unimpressive all around. The beans and rice didn't taste very fresh. Not terrible, just cheap. Same with the guacamole.

One thing did shine, though. The chips and salsa were great. They give you a huge plate of chips and a tub of salsa. The chips taste homemade and were lightly salted, just right.. The salsa was excellent. Great kick! A little on the watery side, but hard to complain when it's so good.

Unless you just have to have a Sonoran Hot Dog, I'd say you can skip this place."}
{"text":"I will give them credit for the Salsa that comes with the chips.  It's very tasty.  Smokey, just a \"tad\" runny, but chock full of nice-sized onion chunks.  My two kids and I both loved it.

The rest of the food - nothing too special.  We had a chicken torta, and it was \"OK\" - nothing to make it stand out, yet nothing to complain about either.  Thus the 3 stars.

I want to give them another try and see if they can improve my view of them - and to give myself a chance to try more items."}
{"text":"I always always get the chicken Morenos burrito with green sauce. SO good. The last time we went my boyfriend found three pieces of hair in his torta. Really unappetizing, wish there was more of a Salas's selection. But no other complaints about."}
{"text":"Tenderized taco meat glistening in the artery clogging wonderland known as Morenos.  The Pastor and asada tacos made me thankful that I'm not a practicing  Muslim or Hindu because I would be forced to \"sin\" on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the tacos are only 99 cents. yup; only 99 cents for some of the most flavorful tacos that are bursting at the seams (from so much meat on a little tortilla). I understand why they give you a second tortilla w every taco. you need a second one to eat all of the meat that fell out of the first tortilla!!"}
{"text":"For a strip mall faster type food it's pretty good have had breakfast and dinner here and will have today I have no complaints. The staff are humping  they help each other out on tables. They do have beer here. Small area outside seating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Place to get Mexican food.  I usually go between the tacos or the tortas with both of them being equally delicious.  I love the interior of the place and how well maintained it is. I usually get some tacos de adobada which are pretty good but are made better by their avocado sauce that they serve. Also I really like that they have a small set up where you can get various toppings for the food for example that delicious avocado sauce I mentioned as well as pickled carrots, and various types of sauces."}
{"text":"Can't complain about a single thing !!!!!!! Awesome food , great staff , To Die For Margaritas    I went through most of the menu myself and I loved every dish !!"}
{"text":"I am lucky enough to work with a few guys who are always in search of the best places to eat Mexican food, and thanks to my co-workers I have found Moreno's.

This small taco shop has become a regular spot for me, especially on Wednesday's when it is 99 cent taco day. 

Their Carne Asada tacos are absolute perfection. The Carne Asada is so flavorful and tasty, with onions, cabbage and cilantro. They are on perfect little flour tortillas, very thin so they double them up. Also don't forget to swing by the condiment bar and get some of their guac sauce, as I like to call it. A really refreshing Avocado sauce, with great flavor.

Their Tortas, and Sonoran hot dogs are really good too!

If you're ever around, stop by Moreno's, I usually get mine to go!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place and is close to my house. I really wanted to love it. Staff were great, the place itself is nice and looks clean. The chips and salsa were quite good and they also include bean dip, which doesn't happen everywhere. Prices were acceptable. I ordered Pollo Fundido and the serving was very generous. Sadly the entree was very dry and bland. I was disappointed. I might try something else another time to give them a fair chance. Good luck, Moreno's! Put some personality into your food and you will succeed!"}
{"text":"We had a discount available here, and the reviews are good, so it's time for some Mexican food!

Parking lot is small, and so is the restaurant.  It wasn't bad when we were there, but if they get busy there may not be any room.

The booths are cramped. I'm not THAT fat and I had trouble sliding into the booth.  You order at the counter. A lot of classics like tacos and fajitas, some different items like sopes.  We ordered the chimichanga especial (which has a spinach/cheese sauce) and a fajita burrito.

The chimi especial was overpowered by the cheese sauce.  Which was surprising.  But it doesn't take much cheese and then all you taste is the cheese.  The spinach adds nothing.  I wouldn't order this one again.  Maybe the regular chimi is better, but avoid the \"especial\".

The fajita burrito was very nice. The chicken was grilled and had good flavor. The veggies were fresh and grilled but still crisp.  This dish by itself is probably four stars, and I would be more excited about this place if that was the only thing I had tried.

The rice was OK.  Nothing special or unique, but it was fine.  The beans were the typical splat of goo most places serve.  Well, to be fair this splat was brown instead of gray.  A lot of places serve gray refried beans.  But even as a brown splat they were uninspired.  No seasoning, nothing to make them interesting.  A few shreds of cheese may look nice but added nothing to the flavor.  If I were to come back here I would ask for double-rice no beans.

Glad we had a discount.  If I had to pay full price for this meal I would be annoyed.  It was better than Taco Bell, certainly.  But overall not really exciting."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but after coming here 6 times in 2 months, I just can't take the horrible service anymore.  They just don't care.  I won't be coming back.  I hoped it would have got better, but no."}
{"text":"The food, music, and great service makes this place so alive! Even when it's busy the service is respectful and kind. Watching their teamwork makes me wish I ran a business myself."}
{"text":"My wife and I were just driving around looking for a place to eat. We spotted Moreno's and the place was packed at 7pm on a Sat night (4/8/17). We found an outdoor table and was served immediately. Pleasant atmosphere, chips and salsa were brought out right away. My wife ordered the street tacos and I had a Tejano burro with carne asada. She liked the tacos and the burro was warm and spicy (just right). I boxed half for a later meal. Good service. I recommend this location. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to visit this establishment and I finally had the opportunity today, the yelp opinions really had my curiosity on cue, well I must Say I was not disappointed by any means, the dish that I ordered came in a timely manner (6 minutes) and was pleasantly hot.  I  ordered the Carne Asada Burrito  & Chicken Taco plate.....all I can say is GREAT.....I will come back for the Rice & Beans alone very tasty no seasonings was necessary.

This establishment will be added to my GOTO list, well worth the visit, I have no complaints......OOPS the Salsa could be hotter......LoL. no one gets away that easy."}
{"text":"We've ordered food that's really good here- fish tacos are incredible with the pineapple and mango salsa. The Carmelo- a folded quesadilla with whole beans, chicken, cheese, salsa- yum! Prices are a little high, and the service could be better."}
{"text":"So we tried this place again and the food was ok.. Not over salty like last time. 
It took forever to take our order. The girl at the register seemed confused and distracted.
They had an enchilada plate as an special and it had the words \"meat or chicken\" next to it. Well when I ordered the meat enchilada plate, I noticed they charged me $1.50 more. I asked why and worker said because I ordered beef. I told her it doesn't say there is a extra charge for meat on the special board. 
They said I can get cheese enchilada if I don't want to pay the up charge for meat.
That was a bit sneaky, I thought. Automatically charging customers 1.50 for the meat in a meat enchilada. hum?
We had to ask the waitress to wipe off our table, because all the tables were dirty. 
The floors had food on them too.
But as far as the food and the salsa bar it was good. It wasn't great. It was just good.
My husband is Mexican and he wasn't thrilled with their food. He said the taco meat didn't taste fresh. And the food wasn't hot, just lukewarm. His large aqua fresco was almost $4.A bit expensive. Our bill came to 27.00 for 2 plates , 1 bottle water and 1 aqua fresca. Too high for what we got. The workers were not very friendly either.
So all in all, I don't think we will come back here."}
{"text":"I have been on a quest.. a quest for the almighty bacon wrapped hot dog or the Tijuana Hot Dog aka Mexican Hot Dog.. these bad boys are so illegal one lady selling them in LA was sent to jail for 45 days! Apparently the board of health doesn't look to kindly on street vendors grilling these on the side of the road. 

After much searching on the internet for potential suitors for me quest I found this one, Mereno's in Mesa. This place isn't just in Mesa but in the part of Mesa that is well, like stepping into Little Mexico. Its awesome really.. carneceria's, Mexican food stands and of course 2 TJ hot dog joints (the second we spotted on the drive up to Moreno's).

Once there we were impressed! With all the buildings around there looking worn and tattered, Moreno's was like finding the Titty Twister in the middle of the Mexican desert, place was hopping! Of course we we're the only white boys in there but hey, if you like the looks of Latin men, well heyyyyyyyy!! 

We ordered 4 dogs, a cheese quesadilla and a carne asada burro.. oh, they also have Coke and Sprite (Mexican versions) in the glass bottle! Saweet! After ordering we were told that we need to go back outside and pick up the dogs. Strange but okay.. made me a little nervous until we got outside and there was a street cart.. this guy was the hot dog monster! He had 4 made with all the toppings (beans, onions, salsa, etc) but to or disappointment the dogs weren't wrapped in bacon. Apparently the AZ board of health got to this place as well. The bacon was chopped and put into the hot dog boat (bun with a slit only in the center).  

When we got inside we grabbed a booth and took in the surroundings. This place is actually pretty decent. Super clean, very comfortable and a nice salsa bar close to the counter. They had avocado cream, 2 kinds of salsa as well as cucumbers and radishes plus limes.  We of course we to town, I love 'salad' with my Mexican food! Once we were set up we tore into the dogs! They were fantastic.. the flavors and textures were as comforting as they were somehow exotic. Mayonnaise with salsa and bean, who knew?

The burro and the quesadila showed shortly after a few minutes. Oh the quesadilla.. super crispy and cheesy! The carne asada burro was huge! Surprisingly packed full of meat, pico de gallo and rice.. Ive never had one this way but I cant believe what Ive been missing all these years! Tender, salty, a little spicy (additional salsa) and slightly creamy as the rice was done very well! 

As we waddled out of there and made it to the car we knew that we will certainly be coming back! On the way west to the 101 we noticed about 4 different street carts, all serving the same thing.. those yummy TJ hot dogs!

Anyone up for a crawl? Who knows, maybe one will be wrapped in bacon?"}
{"text":"I have review other Morenos locations and find all locations to have great food at good prices and good service.

The owner Angel is super friendly and clearly has a good thing going as he opens more locations. 

Morenos should become one of your favorite go to spots for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hard To Beat Tasty Burritos For A Great Price!

Moreno's has been in of my favorites for over 15 years! Angel, the owner has always been very friendly and the food is good and the prices are more than fair as well. 

This place is hard to beat for a good feeding...."}
{"text":"We love Morenos! The owner Angel is a really friendly guy, the staff does a good job and the food is good Mexican food at Super reasonable prices!

We have eaten at a few locations of theirs and this is sure to become one of your new favorite spots!

This location is not really set up for groups, use their Broadway and Horne location in Mesa or the Gilbert location for bigger groups."}
{"text":"Service was actually great. The food was good/ok. Nothing to write home about but hit the spot as needed. The one big con was the protein  portions. Several of us ordered various meals. All noted there wasn't a lot of meat in each. As meat eaters, I would like to see more meat in the entrees (especially the burritos). The biggest pro was friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times and each time the food was just ok but the service was terrible. The ladies at the register were rude and seemed as if I was bothering them when I get there to pick up my order. I can stand at the counter a few minutes with 4 workers up there before anyone even acknowledges me. Last visit was today. The STV location offers much better service."}
{"text":"Kind staff. There are not many great places to eat this way. I like their chips and salsa but for the love give us salsa cups we actually fit a chip into. Love their special chimi - terrible for the waist."}
{"text":"Ordered the carmelo (essentially a quesadilla) and the amount of meat was fantastic!  Husband ordered the Sanoran dog (unfortunately the car outside was not manned, but they make the dogs inside so that was not an issue).  There is a salsa bar with about 6 different options.  The combo for only about $1 more came with rice and beans and a drink.  There are free refills of fountain soda.  The cashier was very patient while us out-of-towners figured out what to order.

The place was packed at 10:30 in the middle of the week.  That really speak to how good the service and food are.  Private parking lot, and easy to see from the street."}
{"text":"I absolute LOVE the taco combo plate with shredded beef and soft corn tortillas. The meat is never fatty and tastes like moms pot roast in Taco form. The rice is always moist and the bean dip and chips is oh so yummy! Cheap, clean, and good food!"}
{"text":"$7.99 for ONE SINGLE spinach enchilada??  Are you kidding me?  How does a small tortilla with some spinach and cheese cost that much?

The waitress failed to tell that one single spinach enchilada costs that much before I ordered.  My friend got an entire burrito with guac and cheese on top and it was only $6.

Total ripoff and the customer service was awful.  Do not recommend this place.  RIP OFF."}
{"text":"I always like to find a good breakfast burrito so I scoped around and came across Moreno's. I ordered the bacon breakfast burrito, side of bean and a half dozen tamales. The burrito was huge and very hot when I took it home. Overall, I think it was good, not great, but pretty good. I think it would have been better if the salsa was more flavorful. It didn't have much flavor at all and had a weird taste. The tamales we great! Once thing that I would change is the professionalism with the back of the house employees. They are loud and laugh way too much. Makes you kind of think they are talking about you in Spanish. Would I go there again? Yes, but not all the time."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.. Mexico City street street tacos: beef, pick, chicken was amazing along with sides of pickled carrots and fresh cucumber!! Lime margaritas were perfect : just the right amount of salt!! Chips and salsa were delivered and devoured!! Grande burrito lived up to its name. Taking most of it home !!"}
{"text":"The Tortas were great, we had the Adobada, so were the chicken tacos, I had 2. But the real suprise were the hot dogs. Never have I seen them prepared in such a fashion, they look as great as they taste. ask for them with the works. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my kind of Mexican restaurant.  Yes it's a dive.  Yes you order at the counter and your food arrives on a paper plate.  But, the food is so unbelievable.  They are a sweet Mexican family and their sauces, tortillas, beans, etc. are just delicious.  I have found that the best Mexican food is generally found in a dive and this is no exception.  But if you really like good Mexican food where the beans don't taste like they do at every other Mexican restaurant and you like high quality meat and cheese, give this dump a try.  I went once and now I'm an addict.  FYI, I wouldn't change the decor one bit!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food at a decent price!! Cheese enchiladas are SO GOOD. The tortas are also a personal fav! Cute environment. The Sonoran dogs are on my list to try!"}
{"text":"We came here to try out of curiosity. Happened to come during happy hour, which is Half off appetizers, and cheaper drinks. We were greeted by a friendly server and seated, and served a fresh house-made basket of tortilla chips with three different dips. A house made salsa, a tomatillo sauce, and a yummy bean dip.
We ordered a couple of margaritas and they were delicious. Only five bucks during happy hour.
We then ordered our mains, both hubby and I had the combo number two which is one taco and one burrito with your choice of meat, served with beans and rice. We both had the shredded beef taco, in which the taco shell is house-made and wonderful, and we both had the 'mixta' burrito which consists of a combination of pork and carne Asada meat.
Unlike most places, the burrito here was huge and filled mostly with meat, instead of being filled with more rice and beans than meat like other places. 
The taste and flavour of the pork was amazing, and our next visits here, I will be eating exclusively the pork.
The service was great, and we will be back for sure.
Not sure why this place only got a three star rating, because our experience here was much better. We will definitely be back as the flavours are much better than most Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Been going there for a while however stopped going because they charged me for salsa when I had a to go order. Mexican food places are a dime a dozen and I refuse to pay for salsa, this was a first time for me getting billed for salsa. Lol"}
{"text":"We had the carne asada and shrimp tacos. So good! We came on Saturday and had to come back again on Sunday cause all I could think about all day was tacos."}
{"text":"Not great. I was expecting it to be up to the quality of the other Moreno's location or the other Gecko Grill. Waitress had no clue what the menu items were. Requests for more salsa were not fulfilled. There was obvious miscommunication among the staff. We were charged for random items on our meal, like salsa Fresca. We were constantly out of water. A to-go order for 1 person took more than 30 minutes due to the fact that they did not call out names. They entered the coupon incorrectly. The menu stated different ingredients than what was found in the meal (a burrito said to have just chicken and beans also contained lettuce and rice). I understand everyone is new, but my experience makes me not want to come again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars. I came in here for Mother's Day, for my Mother in Law. I ordered 2 tamales with a side of rice. All a la cartel items. They brought out a plate almost filled with beans and cheese, even the tamales had cheese and beans on it. By the time the waiter came back for me to even say anything my table was finished eating. Also, it was extremely dirty in there, so maybe it was best I didn't eat anything at all. Not to mention the fact that it took 3 different people hearing our story to adjust the bill. With sooo many good Mexican restaurants in the valley I don't know why you would go here."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, delicious! We got the carne asada breakfast plate and the spinach and mushrooms omelette. Also, a side of pancakes, yummmm yummm.
The carne asada breakfast plate is not on the menu, buy ask for it, is delicious, full of flavor. 
The Omelette was delicious, no just the spinach and mushrooms were delicious but it was full of cheese 
Pancakes were fluffy and yummy.
Our server was Christian. He was patient, helpful and kind. He definitely made our visit better.
Prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"Service was not good today. Went in and got seated. Waited for at least five minutes without as much as an acknowledgement from our waitress. Am very disappointed because I really like the food. Will give it another try hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating lunch there yesterday. I was greeted as I walked in the door with a big smile and could sit wherever I wanted. I was brought chips and three different dips and a big glass of water. My waiter was Michael and he was very nice. He explained the menu and then brought me a glass of iced tea. My companion showed up and we ordered soft taco's. Omgosh, delicious! The shredded beef was from a pot roast and so tender. There was a generous amount of beef in the taco's. We then ordered a new item for dessert. A piece of hot apple pie with vanilla ice cream. Needless to say, we cleaned our plates. I'll be back--it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations!  Menu was very large, excellent kids menu, good prices and the food had authentic flavor.  The dining area was clean and was good sized with televisions.  There is also outdoor seating and a large salsa bar.  I had street tacos with pork adobada.  My wife had a burrito fajita style that was really good but she passed on the spinach cheese sauce.  Kids loved the cheese quesadilla with rice!  They also have alcohol in the dining area.  Would definitely go back for casual Mexican food without the high prices."}
{"text":"Small place,,, more of a take out joint but the best local authentic mexican food. Everything on the menu is delicious. Tacos adobado's, Torta's, Burro's,  Tostada's de ceviche and of course the Sonoran Dogs :)"}
{"text":"Their California Burrito is a sign that a higher being surely exists. Everything I have tried here has been delicious, however. Literally everything. This is by far my favorite place to grab some Mexican food.

The only thing that I'm not to keen on about this place is that they aren't always on their game with their customer service. The first time I came into this place the girl working there was insanely rude, but it has gotten better through time. I'm usually rolling in pretty late, and I'm sure with how busy they are that the people working there are just more than ready to go home. I can't really hate on  them for that."}
{"text":"Awesome food.... This new location has the same great Moreno's quality and service as the other locations. :)"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever ordered is amazing! The staff is super friendly and fast. Food is served hot and fast too! Self serve salsa bar and it's nice and cold inside on a hot day. They even pick up your trash for you! No need to clean up after yourself. It's nice not to have a trashcan in the lobby that smells bad. Go for lunch or dinner....You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I watched the Sonorian Hot Dog  throw down in Tucson on the travel channel and was craving a sonorian dog.  There happened to be one right around the corner from us so we decided to try it.  

Surprisingly the Sonorian Hot Dog at Moreno's was very good!  $3 worth of goodness!  It's a must try, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Small establishment in a strip mall,  but the service was good,  the food was excellent,  and the price was decent as well.   Next time I'm in AZ and craving Mexican,  I'll more than likely make this stop."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always delicious and service is fast and friendly. We've ordered a variety of things burros, flautas and tacos. I love their green salsa."}
{"text":"Just a little advice, check your to go orders. Every time I come here my orders are incorrect and the staff really doesn't care if it's correct or not. To go ordering over the phone is painful you must repeat your order several times and your order will still be incorrect. I will not be returning to this location. I've been to several other Moreno locations and the service has been great. Not sure what's going on at this location."}
{"text":"I asked my nephew where he wanted to go lunch and he begged me to take him to Mereno's! It was really good, I had a fish taco and a shrimp taco. Both were super fresh and juicy (the shrimp was my favorite however because it came with pineapple) my starving nephew got the grande burrito and scarfed it down quick. The only thing that would have made it 5 stars was the food took long to come out and our waitress was also the bartender so she was very busy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself isn't very big, and it seemed like they have a good amount of servers/staff. The ratio of tables to staff seemed to be in excess of staff, but I felt that service was lacking and really slow. There were a lot of staff standing around when we entered. No one greeted us or gave is instructions on where to sit. This was our first time so we didn't have a clue. After we sat ourselves, it took some time to get a menu. Ordering was relatively quick once we met our server. The food itself is mediocre. Follow up on the food and getting our check was also time consuming."}
{"text":"The first time my daughter and I came in here was two or three years ago after a Christmas tree lighting in downtown Chandler and this place was a madhouse. We did order and the food was delicious. I came back a week or two later to try them under calmer circumstances and again the food was wonderful, especially the Fresas Con Crema, strawberries and cream, which was a huge goblet full and could have fed a family of four. 

I'm back in town again 2 years later and was looking for a place to eat a late breakfast so I pulled in here, remembering that it was good. I ordered what I thought would be a simple bacon and eggs breakfast with beans and rice but I got a gigantic platter which again looked like it would feed a family. The bacon and eggs were actually cooked together and it looked like there were half a dozen eggs with a pound of bacon mixed in. Everything was delicious and I brought half of it home to eat later for dinner. I had no unseemly after effects either. I guess I will keep patronizing this place and recommending it to others."}
{"text":"Good food and service our food was 
nice hot when received . 
The restaurant is clean and good cool AC"}
{"text":"Taco food good.  Little pricy.  Service. Good!!!attmosphere good   little noisey  music. Might help!!!mostly good!!!!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I have been going to their family's establishments for YEARS. Gecko Grill in Gilbert as well as the other Moreno's locations. The food here is good, but the service is terrible. I ordered their moreno's burrito, which both their website as well as their menu inside states that it includes: choice of meat, beans, cabbage, cilantro, rice, onions, salsa, etc. When I ordered this one the first time, I told them I didn't want any meat or cheese. When I received my food, it literally had nothing in it besides rice. WTH? What about all the other stuff? The second time I ordered it, I said the same thing...the moreno's burrito with no meat or cheese. She said, \"okay so a bean and cheese burrito.\" I said,\" no, I want the moreno's burrito...doesn't that have rice, cabbage, cilantro, etc.\" she said, \"yes yes it does\" I said \"okay great. I want all that other stuff, just not the meat or cheese.\" How hard is that to comprehend?! When I got it, yet again, the only thing inside the burrito was beans. This time I took it back, told her what happened and asked if they could just give me everything that was missing on the side, rather than having to remake it. She gave me a bag of items (never apologized the order was wrong) and I left, only to find out when I got home that I was still missing something. Not to mention, their pricing is not the same at their store as it is on their website. The food is good, and I'm sure if you order something without modifying it, it's probably okay. I will continue to go back because the food is tasty, but I will stick to a plain burrito and add other things to it myself."}
{"text":"My kids and I love this restaurant!! The service is exceptional and the food is great!! The food is always fresh and the bean dip is amazing!! My kids favorite item is the Cheese Crisp!! I love their tacos and the fajitas are one of the best!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for lunch appointments and even dinner with my wife. It has a great local feel. Friendly staff, clean, and great tasting food. I can't get enough of the green tomatillo salsa. I recommend the salmon and shrimp tacos. The service isn't the best because all of the servers are young local kids with probably their first server job so they are learning. But that's part of what makes it a cool local place."}
{"text":"I'm very particular when it comes to Mexican Food and this has been excellent every single time I've been there.  The location is tiny but always busy and they do quite a bit of to go orders as well!  Very good food for an excellent price.  Food always comes out quickly and hot!  

There always seem to be quite a few servers however they seem to not really have rhyme or reason to where they should be so you just wait for your person to come back.  Bus boys are always cleaning and turning over tables quickly!

Great food and lunch specials!  Happy hour menu too!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this Moreno's multiple times now, but am not sure I will be attempting it anymore. The service is pretty slow. There always seems to be so many servers standing behind the counter chatting. I guess that wouldn't be so terrible if the food was great, but most everything I've tried (from the chicken enchilada's, shredded beef chimichanga, and even the cheese quesadilla) were all really bland. I don't think they put much spice or flavor in their meat and the salsa's are just ok. It's not bad, but I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you have any concerns about a Mexican food restaurant inside a strip mall. Put your worries aside. This is hands-down one of the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The service is always great the green sauce is off the charts. It has become one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley. My wife and I were lucky enough to be waited on by David today. And this kid gets customer service he was quick and never let my glass get empty. Just the kind of place I enjoy going to!!
Thanks for your great restaurant"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to get homemade Mexican food the old fashion way.   Like my Nana,  Tios and Tias make.  Soo good.  
I enjoy everything."}
{"text":"Ok food, great service! David was our server and was very friendly and attentive!  The salsas were tasty, the food was fresh, and the portions generous!"}
{"text":"Service is not always great here, they are kinda lazy but the Sonoran hot dogs are to die for. I've been coming here for about 5 years and can't get enough of the Sonoran hot dogs. The bread is phenomenal. The street tacos are also good, but not the best."}
{"text":"Friendly people here. Been here 3 times. Food tastes authentic. Has a CLEAN sauce/salsa bar that includes cucumbers! Only problem is their service set up, you don't really get a waiter, more of an expediter who drops the food. But the food is great. Not sure what nights they do it but I think they grill outside as well."}
{"text":"Its 11:30 on Friday night and had to go pick daughter up from her job, and we started talking and she said she was starving, and I said ME TOO buy me some food,,,yea she just got paid LOL we were in the mood for something spicy (but that's a normal thing for us) and she said Mom you should try Moreno's, now I have driven past it many of times and never gave it any thought. So I said well since your buying I can't be choosey right? So we went to Morenos, now I don't know when this place closes, but let me tell you at 11:30 is was still poppin, we went inside and placed our order, I got the carne asada burrito enchilada style and a big bottle of sprite, my daughter got a bean n cheese burrito and a fresa (strawberry drink that sort of like strawberry milk). We were taking the food to go, so I loaded up on the salsa and wanted to try the green guac sauce, man glad I did, that guac sauce was delish, mad that I didn't get more LOL We got our food and was headed out, but I swung by the guy grilling dogs outside, man they looked and smelled so good gonna have to try one of them next time! For a late night snack or grub this is the place to go, the food was great, the service was friendly and fast and the place has a nice vibe to it. ..."}
{"text":"So I've never been to Moreno's before and I feel like I have missed out on some delicious food! For any new comers, you NEED to try the Estilo Sonora - basically hot dog heaven. It's an easy and cheap add on to your meal, especially if you like hot dogs with lots of toppings and an amazing bun - You won't be disappointed. 

My other order was pretty plain and simple, a bean and cheese burrito. It was done right and tasted like it should. Food came out quick enough for a great work-lunch spot and we had great service.

Word to the wise: the booths aren't comfortable if you're on the larger side...I'm just saying."}
{"text":"I kinda feel sad about the two (2) star reviews, because this place is really good. I avoided this place for 3 1/2 years now (as long as it's been here) because it looked a little sketchy from the outside and I thought it was just one of those gross Mexican food places to eat at. I now find myself kicking myself. The hot dog cart is outside the entrance and all you have to do is go in and pay for your dog inside and they give you a ticket that you show the man outside to order. $3 for a pretty decent Sonoran dog grilled on a griddle, wrapped in Mesquite-smoked bacon, topped with chopped tomatoes, onions, shredded yellow or cotijo cheese, tomatillo salsa or red chili sauce, pinto beans, mayonnaise, ketchup and/or mustard, and served on a bun with a fresh-roasted chili. 

Oddly enough, I liked that the menus are on five different flat screen tv's. The Carne Asada burrito was phenomenal, way better than any other Mexican fast food restaurant. The salsas were tasty which is something that is very important since I always start the meal by drinking some salsa. If it is good, then the restaurant is good. Smoked chile and garlic salsa is always welcome! The green guacamole sauce is great!

The tortillas are super soft and the beans were homemade, nice texture and flavor. I still prefer the rice at La Tolteca (but hey, no one can compete with that place) but it was still moist and flavorful. They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a Sonoran hot dog after seeing them on Food Wars, but Tucson was too far.  So, we found this place and gave it a try. 

The hot dogs are very, very tiny. and are covered in a lot of goo.  Definitely not something I'd seek out again, at this place anyway. Their strawberry agua fresca tasted like strawberry milk, not a good taste. And the horchata was probably the worst I've ever had.  Still looking for that Sonoran hot dog!"}
{"text":"Just got a Sonoran dog for me and my son , he's never had one and the guy was very patient and walked thru every ingrident to make it to his liking ...which I really appreciated on top of that ...that was honestly the best damn hot dog I've ever eaten and the price was amazing !!!"}
{"text":"So this is my go to for carne asada and now Sonoran hot dogs except I haven't really tried other places Sonoran dogs so hard to say this will be my staple for them for now. But it definitely is for carne asada tacos for sure. When I think about carne tacos I think of morenos esp on Wednesdays.  The green sauce idk what it is but I love drenching my tacos with the sauce so they are practically drowned. :) so good!"}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced!  Had Carne Asada burrito and crispy beef taco.  Meat was not too salty and there was plenty on both.  

Their salsa bar was fresh and clean.  In fact, the entire place is very clean and they seem to take pride in it.

I highly recommend Moreno's.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"My cOmpany is catering a lunch next week and this place is super close. My boss wanted a bag of chips & salsa to try out before we ordered & I wanted a bean & cheese burro. I called in the order & went to pick it up & the guy at the counter wouldn't let me order chips & salsa. He kept telling me the burro came with complimentary chips & 2 ounces of salsa. He would not listen to me so I left without any food. Needless to say our company lunch will not be catered by Morenos. LOL!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the salsa was watery and when asked for a chunkier salsa that has spice we got the same thing with chitopene. The servers were friendly and the establishment is clean."}
{"text":"Awesome place, the hot dog is awesome. I also tried the carne asada burrito and it was great."}
{"text":"The Hot Dogs are the bomb.comb. The lengua tacos are amazing. Good late munchie food. Carne asada tacos and bean cheese burrito also very good. Friendly staff and the place is clean and food is fresh. Hot dog cart reminds me of the street vendors in Downtown LA."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Aways busy and  I have eaten here a dozen times since they opened and have enjoyed consistent service and quality food every time.  This place is the definition of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Just ate at Moreno's for the first time. First they brought out fresh chips that are thin and warm and they come with bean dip, red and green salsa that are all good. I had a chicken tostada and a fish taco. The fish taco was served on two fresh corn tortillas and the sauce was full of flavor! Loved them both. Also at our table we had a Moreno's chicken burrito with green salsa and it was very good but the green salsa was a little spicey. We will make this a regular spot for good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I could've sworn I've rated this place before. I guess not. Anywho...One of the best Mexican Hot Dogs. This is my 3rd time here. My only request is that they open one closer to my area (border line S. Phoenix/Laveen) :)"}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere, pretty interior. Unfortunately, the food was bland, average at best.  We tried 4 different plates but all were just ok.  

Starting with the chips and salsa.  None had any kick.  The green sauce had an awkward sweetness to it.  When our lunch arrived, we asked for some jalapenos to spice things up and they brought us a small cup of canned jalapenos
.
Our waiter was nice and courteous but super slow.  We saw him 3 times the entire time.  We could see all the waiters standing in front of the food window talking.

One happy note, the flan was very good, even though we had to wait about 15 minutes to get it."}
{"text":"This has always been good but yesterday there was sugar in the cilentro sauces, chicken tamales and the fish tacos.  The cook messed up big time!!"}
{"text":"We just tried Moreno's Mexican Grill for the first time. Derek, our server, did a great job! He brought us warm tortilla chips with red salsa, tomatillo, and bean dip. Our party ordered the fajita combination (beef and shrimp), beef chimichanga, and seafood Grande. We all agreed that our food was very good. We especially appreciated that it was not greasy like some places. Portions were generous. We happened to get seated in a booth where we could see in the kitchen when the servers went in and out. The kitchen is very clean! The whole restaurant is very clean. They have a separate bar area, and plenty of outdoor seating. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood-style Mexican restaurant that I never would have found without Yelp. The food is delicious and there are lots of choices. Comparable to my favorite taquerias back home in California. I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5, though, because I feel they are a tad expensive. You want chips with your meal? Pay for a basket. Want sour cream and guacamole in your burrito? Those are extra, too."}
{"text":"Very good visit to Moreno's tonight. I had the Arroz con pollo, which for those who do not speak Italian means , rice with chicken. Jk it's Spanish y'all thought I was dumb. I love the chicken rice dish here. I love that cheese sauce on there too but I don't like the side of beans so I get the refried instead. I texted morenos text club and got a free soda too! How fancy! Love the rice here. Very good I'll be back again. Also I get like 3 cups of that green sauce because it's soooo good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food that ive ever had in my life! The chicken in the enchiladas was from a can and the green sauce that came on it was canned. The green salsa is sweet. Never again!"}
{"text":"Very good.

Great customer service, all of the employees were prompt and quick.

Regarding their Sonoran hot dogs, I'm not too sold on their choice bread they use as a replacement to hot dog bun. The ratio gets thrown off. Too much bread to hot dog and toppings, but it's pretty unique and creative."}
{"text":"Had the Chimichanga - excellent. Then ordered up a Sonoran Hot Dog - it was also excellent. It thought it was a fast food type place, but it took a good 15 min to get my food - a testament to the freshness & quality of the food. I will be back and take my friends to experience a Sonoran Hot Dog."}
{"text":"I had heard from a close friend that Moreno's Mexican Grill made good food. I had doubts but I was very surprised when I went recently. The food was great. I had the three taco combo with a large horchata to wash it all down. The tacos were tasty and done right. Took me back to the street tacos of Mexico. The beans and rice were great too."}
{"text":"Taco Wednesday is so good. Service is usually great. Tonight the husband ordered soft tacos with flour and he ended up with corn.  Could be a bit more attentive. Salsa is amazing."}
{"text":"An average mexican food place/ bar.  I had trouble with getting the order correct.  Also food is fresh but nothing special.  Abit pricy for what i got.  2 quesadillas and 2 tacos and soft drinks for $47 was not impressed."}
{"text":"I would say this is my favorite spot to satisfy my hunger. I simply just order Vampiros de asada all day!!"}
{"text":"If I had reviewed this place after only eating their food a few times, I would probably have given them 5 stars.. I've ordered delivery from them about 8 times total between the middle of march and now. The first 4 times we had food from them they were excellent! The food was delicious the delivery didn't take very long, the delivery guy was great. Overall, those first 4 experiences were awesome. Since then their service has gone downhill consistently. The last time that we ordered from them our order was entirely screwed up and we had waited 1hr & 50 mins for chile relleno, 2 tacos, 2 horchatas, and a taco salad. All of our food was cold and we only got 1 horchata because the delivery driver dropped the other one. Their tacos are usually great but these were just bad. Anyway, I'm not sure what's been going on at Moreno's in Tempe, but everytime we've ordered from them it's gotten worse. I hope this is temporary because when we first had their food, I loved it."}
{"text":"Best tomatillo salsa around.  The Grande Burro with Carne Asada is my favorite burrito in the valley.  Or if you are living large you can go with the Gecko Burro with Carne Asada which is essentially the same thing but comes drenched in spinach queso with rice and beans on the side.  I am not sure I have a more favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Saturday, March 11,2017
Met some friends here for dinner, this was my first time to Moreno's. The staff was friendly, the environment was casual and the food was tasty and satisfying. This is a great place to go for casual dinning and good food. This is a place, I would return to again."}
{"text":"Great food! I love the sweet corn tamale and the cheese enchiladas  quick service and attentive. And you can't forget the yummy bean dip."}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo. 
Let's start off with the good. Rice and beans...exceptional. They have bottled water. They have kids' meals. Son loved his flautas. There are several booths and tables so you can dine in or take out, and the cashiers spoke both English and Spanish well. The tables seemed clean and had napkin-holders so you don't have to hunt down someone and beg for extra napkins.

Now the bad. My other son's fries were very salty, as was my hubby's burrito. My quesadilla was a special for the day, with carne asada. The girl said their carne asada was really good. It was not. I have had good carne asada and this wasn't it. The quesadilla was, however, full of meat, unlike one reviewer showed a picture of for his. We never got our drinks before the food came, and when we asked the kid who brought the food about the drinks, he smiled, walked away, and started doing some other chore. I had to go ask for our drinks!  Awesome customer svc, bro.

The extra salt, the underwhelming carne asada, and missing drinks plus the kid ignoring us all made this review non-5-star-worthy. I probably should not even give it 3 stars, but the rice and beans were that good."}
{"text":"So, the first time here, I wasn't sold. After an in-house experience, I think that I'm over coming here.

We were seated right away, and I could see the game, which was cool. The booth seats were greasy and had lost of crumbs, which was not cool. A young man who looked like he wanted to join Kid & Play back in the 90s took our order and brought drinks.  We pretty much couldn't find him in the small room again until the check. The floors were dirty with food and crickets all over.

Side note: no one here appears to be trained or have any experience, from the hostess to the servers. The bus boy was the best one to talk to in there. Promote him and knock down the servers for a training session or two before they represent your business.

The salsa and bean dip were ok, but the chips seemed like they cam out of a bag. Cold and substandard.  I miss the salsa selection of the other location. Tour bean dip is also super tiny, and with a fee if you wany more. 

My husband got street tacos, which he enjoyed. I got pollo fundido. My first fork full stayed attached by a long, black, baked - in hair. My invisible waiter couldn't help, so I grabbed a random staff member, who sent it back. By the time replacement food came, my husband was finished and it went in a box. ..which promptly went in the trash.

My drink was refilled once with protest. When the mysterious 90s rapper returned with the bill and an \"are you done? \", my husband informed him that my replacement for hadn't arrived yet, to which he replied \"well it wasn't my hair!\". I wasn't taking a poll, kid. 

I was disappointed to see that after all that, the meal was on the bill. But we're not going to argue, we just needed to get the heck outta there! Unless I pick up something for my husband to go, I will NOT be eating her again. A shame, I really love the Horne location"}
{"text":"They just opened a few months ago I believe and we finally Managed to go in last night - I'm very glad we did. Our server, Joe, was More then fantastic!! He recommended something for my husband who LOVED what he got - a secret menu item - the Crabby Burritto. I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo and also enjoyed it very much. The margaritas were amazing. He kept the chips and dips coming while we waited for our food and even offered us a hotter salsa - which was delicious. Honestly enough can't be said about Joe!! The service I receive at restaurants can almost dismiss a bad plate of food for me, and while my dinner was nothing short of great, Joe was even better!! Thank you for a great dining experience Joe! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"If I could a place no stars I would. The service in this place is GOD AWFUL!!! When we sat down they gave us our menu right away however, we sat there for fifteen minutes figured out what we wanted then the girl finally arrived, never took our drink order until then. Then when it got to order she has messed up completely on my company's order. Two out of the three orders was messed up. When my brother sent it back no management can and talked to us, so apologies nothing. To be honest I felt the girl was being racist because everyone else around us she was sitting and taking and took their order right away. Later I found her glaring in our direction at the serving station. The server was very rude, and I will never again be returning to this place. I'm warning you DO NOT EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"Simply...delicious! Me and my family love this place! Their food is great and very reasonable. Highly recommend Moreno's!!!"}
{"text":"Loud, small restaurant.  Third visit.  It gets worse each time. Waitress wanted us to order the second we sat down.  When we asked for a few minutes,  she disappeared for twenty.  I asked twice if all the appetizers were half priced. She responded that they were. When I went to order the shrimp cocktail,  i was told it wasn't half priced. I ordered two lettuce wrapped tacos-from the appetizer menu. The chicken one was so dry, I thought it was dry fish.  What kind of a Mexican restaurant cannot grill chicken?  The salmon taco was fine. Surprise!  The tacos were not half priced either! 
Dried salsa on the wood paneling. Children standing on chair screaming.  It was NOT a happy hour!"}
{"text":"We have tried to like this place..it was recommended to us by a friend so we figured it would be good.  However, we've given it at least 4 tries and each time our order is wrong somehow.  We call in our order to give them plenty of time to make it, but every time, we end up still waiting a good 15 min for our order.  To top it off, the orders are wrong...we've ordered breakfast burritos and regular burritos and they've come with the wrong meat, onions when we've requested no onions, eggs in a non breakfast burrito, etc.  And it's not cheap either!  We wouldn't mind paying more or even waiting a little longer than normal if the food was correct and good but we can't say that.  This morning was the last straw, we won't be back.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Had a Bloody Mary which was very good. We had the egg- chiladas and the Huevos Mexicanos. Both were excellent. We had good service as well as good food. Will definitely be back! I only gave 4 stars due to the strip mall setting."}
{"text":"Ah yes the original mesa location, and my second favorite place in all of Phoenix to get tacos de tripas yummy yummy.  Anyhow, it would be 5 stars to this day iftheir prices hadn't shot up so high.  I remember when on Wednesdays a while back you could still get $1 tacos.  Gone are the days of eating good for cheap."}
{"text":"The Sanoran hot dog was really good. There are a lot of taco types on the menu. The special $4.99 got a Sanoran dog, fries and soda. Can't beat the price. I added a Wednesday taco special $1.25 chicken taco. They put cabbage and onion on it and the home made corn tortilla was also very good. 
The staff was very friendly. I liked the salsa bar and plenty of seating. I will be back for more Sanoran flavor"}
{"text":"I went for lunch in between classes at ASU, and got the chicken chimichanga at the recommendation of my waiter. The most tasty part of my meal was the free salsa. I smothered my bland chicken chimichanga with it."}
{"text":"Good prices and friendly service. They seem to have a good relationship with their regular customers. The food was just mediocre. We got tacos, burritos and chimichangas. The carne asada was my favorite."}
{"text":"Hate leaving 1 star but I have no choice. I'll start with the positives. The place was pretty clean and staff very friendly. Ok the bad part. Chips were greasy the green salsa was as sweet as candy the red was very bland. Zero heat. The bean dip was really weird no salt in anything and I don't use table salt ever. I asked for pico de gallo and it in came in a thimble sized corn chip. That was ok because it horrible too. No salt, lime jalepe√±os basically diced tomatoes and onions. I ordered the green chili burrito. Omg it was disgusting! Tasted like nothing I've ever had. Horrible burned flavor. It's what I'd imagine canned dog food to taste like. Again, not trying to be mean or exaggerate. I didn't want to be wasteful so I thought oh well, and took another bite mid chew I asked why am I doing this to myself? So I spit it out. I don't have the words to describe it other than really weird, burned and horrible. After much coaxing, I got my wife to try it. She blurted out \"Oh my God that's disgusting, how can you eat that ?\" She was working on her food and could see the misery in her eyes. She offered me a bite of her chicken taquito, which was swimming in a puddle of chedder cheese. It tasted like someone took cooked chicken (again no seasoning of any kind, salt and pepper included) wrapped it in a flouer tortilla and dumped cheese on it. That's it. My wife also ordered a carne asada soft taco which came with guacamole which AGAIN had zero flavor. It tasted like a mashed avacado. No salt, lime, tomatoes, jalapenos NOTHING! Her carne asada was, guess what? Completely bland. So we wasted $30 but know never to go back. It wasn't just the worse Mexican food I've ever had, it was the worst food I've ever had in my lifetime. If McDonald's breakfast burrito is a 10 then this would be a 1. I'd rather eat at Circle K. No joke. If I've saved 1 person today, then I've done my job. Sad!"}
{"text":"First time to try this place! I was not disappointed! I had two crispy tacos and rice and beans. Chips and salsa were excellent! The taco dinner was really good! I would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible, the girl at the front desk that takes to go orders mouths off to you. Skip this place"}
{"text":"Cleanest and most authentic mexican food restaurant in the valley, bar none! If you with authentic mexican food then this is your restaurant. The menu is excellent, the food quality is top notch, and the salsa is drinkable. #1 Mexican food for my money,"}
{"text":"A great local joint.  Authentic Mexican chow. We like the Chilequiles with Green pork stew.  They have a salsa bar with fresh condiments which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great food!  Service needs work. Staff is overwhelmed and need to work better as a team.  Once they are more in synch, I think it will be great overall. I'm still willing to go back and try again."}
{"text":"Terrible. The most disappointing part about this restaurant was the service. I felt the staff was rude, inattentive and the food quality was terrible. Ill never go back. I guess trying to capitalize of an area without good Mexican food allows Morenos the authority to try and trick people that it's a good restaurant. It's not. Plenty of places to go to if you don't mind a small commute. If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Good food but HORRIBLE customer service, even worse during breakfast when the place is empty. Food not worth the hassle of waiting to get someone's attention."}
{"text":"Best tacos for the price in Chandler. Authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. They also have Sonoran Hot Dogs. 

Carne Azada and chicken tacos are the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"Where the locals go for Mexican food! We recently moved to the downtown area and were very excited to find this place. Considering Arizonans are really snobby about Mexican food, and the restaurants are prolific in this area, this place must be at the top of anyone's list of places to try."}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican place. At Least Once a week. The food is great every time. I wish the Ala carte menu made more sense (if you order 2 Ala carte enchiladas, like for a child that doesn't want beans and rice) it's MORE expensive than to just order the whole darn plate. Our favorites are the Tejano burrito with asada and the gecko burrito with shredded beef. Oh yummy!! I will suggest on the gecko burrito, order the sour cream and guacamole on the side. It helps keep the burrito hot inside. The sides make the burrito barely warm. Chips are awesome. Love the salsas."}
{"text":"I like their queen creek location better as far as space, set up and friendlier staff but the food was delicious. I recommend the pollo fundito"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Mesa for Mexican food! The ambience is nice. This is definitely no _______bertos- morenos has granite countertops and TV menus. The people are super nice and the prices run at about how much you'd pay for filibertos but the food is quite a bit better. 

Sonoran dogs- can't compare to Tucsons but some of the best I've found in Nesa (i.e. Way better than mickys hot dogs) 
Tacos- 7/10 pretty standard street tacos
Sopas- same as tacos. The meat can be dry occasionally 
Tortas- see above^^^ dry meat ruins everything 
Rice and beans- some of the tastiest I've had! The rice is incredibly fluffy"}
{"text":"It's one of our favorite casual Mexican restaurants! we love the bean dip, Sonoran hot dogs, and strawberry margaritas! Very yummy. The carne asada is also a favorite!"}
{"text":"Fair - beans were barely warm. Rice is real flat. The pineapple sauce on the shrimp taco is good, they use salad shrimp this don't devein the shrimp

Service was ok seems like waiter couldn't grasp what I wanted thus a mix-up on what was delivered. 

Straws and food droppings on floor - lunch rush just ending good time to do little fleshing (ok not sure but had customer move so could clean around base of table; should've been done prior to customer sitting)

Again, I've had worse and I've had better!  Always worth a try!"}
{"text":"We stopped here one morning around 10:30 and asked if they were only serving breakfast. They said we could order the full menu. I tried the shredded beef enchiladas and my wife had a quesadilla with adobada. We both loved our food. We are glad the staff was accommodating and the food was great. We are from out of town and coming here was totally random. I was surprised to see they have chicken fried steak and eggs available at breakfast. It looked really good. If I hadn't already had breakfast that morning I would have tried it. Maybe next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very \"mom and pop shop\" feel. Quick service, incredible pricing, and absolutely delicious! I have never ordered anything that I didn't love."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. Service is friendly but a little slow (understaffed?).  However the food is tasty and the portions are generous. I will come back."}
{"text":"Ive been to a couple Morenos in the east valley with great food and service and my this location wasnt what I expected. I had ordered a Chili Relleno and half way into eating it, I had noticed the cheese wasnt melted all the way. I notified the waitress, the manager came over and seemed a little annoyed. And she asks me, \"what do you want me to do?\". They offered me another one, but I was almost full from other food. So the manager tells me she will take half off, since I ate half already. I don't know if what other places would do, but being in customer service, I would totally take care of my customers. Maybe she had a bad day, but she was definitely not customer service oriented."}
{"text":"If I had to choose between all Mexican Restaurants, I would choose this place.  It is, to me, the most authentic.  The staples are great: fried beef/chicken tacos; red enchiladas; rolled tacos; steak/chicken burros. The rice/beans at this place are the all time best.  For my taste, the salsas are just OK. I wish the food was more spicy. But this is a general problem north of the boarder. 

Try it. Love it. 

Note: I have only been posting about places I really like.  No sense wasting time on places I don't like."}
{"text":"Moreno's looks like it could use some help but its exactly what you're looking for when you want some greasy Mexican food. I got the pollo caramelo (basically a chicken quesadilla) the 1st time I went and the next time I was on that side of town I could hear it calling my name. So. freakin. good. 

Eat it with the creamy green sauce and you will have made it."}
{"text":"Vary good food just need the employees to smile more ( not vary welcoming) and name tags would be recommended"}
{"text":"I am from California and there is plenty of quality Mexican food joints. So i have a good idea what good Mexican food tastes like... From the minute i stepped into this place i was not impressed.
The kid at the front register was a bit douchy for my liking... He must have mistaken me for Latino because he laughed when i said i wanted a steak torta! Steak translates to asada kid use your brain and again laughed at the way i said jarritos... get over yourself kid and take my order. like i said above he was just kinda douchy!

Ordered a steak torta and a small cheese quesedilla.... the torta was mostly bread and lacking in meat... the meat was tasty but just not enough of it.. the sandwich was all bread filler....  bread was good but i didnt pay for a breadwhich! ha

quesedilla was standard fare; small and greasy... 

The salsa bar was ok but i mean maybe you guys can label the fucking salsa? 

All in all if i was visiting arizona gain i would not come back to this place."}
{"text":"Just got off a 14ish hour shift at the hospital and if I had gotten out any later I would've strongly considered chewing on the surgeons arm--starving! Morenos is right across the street so my husband smartly whisked me away. Maybe my lack of blood sugar will make my review a bit biased, but even though I devoured my chips and Gecko burrito, it could've been much better. The chips and salsas/bean dip were a lifesaver and good flavors all around. The margarita didn't last long either (again, long day)and was tasty. But our food needed some help. Both of our dishes, my hubby's chimi and my burrito were borderline cold. As hungry as I was, I would've eaten it frozen, but really we should've sent them back. The cheese inside wasn't even melted and what wasn't cold was room temp. The carne asada in mine was just little burnt chips of meat, while my husband's shredded beef had no flavor. The salsa did help with the dryness and flavor, but it really could've been better. 

I would like to end on a good note though--the service was so friendly and welcoming. I'm sure any complaints would've been addressed efficiently with apology. Just work on the food a bit and we will be back. At least I'm full"}
{"text":"I had a delivery, everything was still very hot. I even got warm chips and salsa. Food was delicious as always."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was awful our waiter was really nice but terribly slow I think we only saw him like 2 times the whole night. We ordered a churro for desert and waited like 20 minutes for it. If I ever decide to go back it will be for take out."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, don't trust all the poor reviews. One of them rated this restaurant when it was only 4 days old for being too crowded and disorganized. It was open only 4 days, give them some time to work out the kinks. 

Another bad one I read was about how the pricing is too high compared to their other location in Chandler. The other location is not a sit down restaurant with servers so of course the price will be a bit more; more overhead. If you are wanting a quick, less expensive experience, the other location is better for that. 

My hubby and I went today at 1:30. The restaurant was busy but we were able to sit down right away. They brought us chips with two salsas plus bean dip. The salsas were delicious. The green tomatillo salsa was a little sweet and mild. The red was very tasty and also mild. My husband loved the bean dip. The first batch of chips and accompaniments are free. I had iced tea which was also very good and tasted fresh brewed.

Hubby ordered the crab relleno which comes with a good sized portion of rice and beans. OMG, that thing was delish! At only $8.99, it was a very good value. I usually hate rellenos but this one was crisp, filled with fresh delicate crab in a spinach cheese sauce, and was all very flavorful. So good! I highly recommend it. 

I had the pollo fundido. It was quite good as well. It was, what I consider, a shareable size and came with rice and beans as well. I liked how it wasn't super greasy or completely drowned in cream sauce. It had just enough under the melted cheese to add flavor without overpowering it. The chicken had good flavor and was obviously not canned or frozen. For $7.99, I felt like I definitely got my money's worth and I have half of my meal leftover for lunch tomorrow. 

The host and server were kind, quick, and efficient. We only waited maybe 10 minutes for our food. The atmosphere was nice and the music was not obtrusive. They have a nice little patio that I'll have to try before it gets too hot. I would not hesitate in recommending this Moreno's Mexican Grill, it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican fare at a convenient location. It's close to The Alamo movie theater. We had the cheese crisp which was average. The burritos the rest of the family ate were average as well. My wife had the crispy tacos that she enjoyed. With so many Mexican food places to choose from in the area, this one is newer and clean. It's spacious, open, and airy.  The cuisine seems more on the gourmet side than traditional fare.  
Try it for lunch as they have great lunch specials. Their appetizers are 1/2 off between 3pm to 6pm."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here several times and every time I've ordered something different and it's been amazing! The green salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is amazing!"}
{"text":"Just tried fish tacos for the first time and it was very good. The wife had a taco and enchilada and it was very good also. The service was great, would recommend this place ti anyone."}
{"text":"Went for karaoke and dinner.   Service was ok, although water refills were scarce.  The salsas are eh - I love green salsa but this was kinda sweet which was odd and the red was a weird smoky chipotle sauce.  I don't know that I would have called it salsa.  Bean dip is good.  Ordered the shrimp mango quesadilla.  I wouldn't order again - it was good but just didn't care for the sweet mango salsa with shrimp and cheese.  The crab relleno we ordered ala carte was delicious - the sauce in particular.   I was ready to lick the plate!   Had a mango margarita on the rocks..... it was eh.  It was really just mango nectar and tequila.  My mom ordered a reposado tequila and they asked her if she wanted it with cranberry juice....hunh?!?  I'd go back to try some of the other dishes and for the karaoke, but this isn't likely to become a favorite."}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB! When we got here it liked very busy and I was afraid we'd have a long wait but it was only about 10 min. We were seated quickly got our chips and two types of salsa and bean dip within minutes of being seated. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. We all ordered the crab relle√±o and it was soo delicious! The coating on the relle√±o was thin and very crispy, packed with crab and smothered with this creamy spinachy ranchero sauce.   
I will definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Why do you go to Moreno's?  For a sonoran hot dog, that's why.  They have a hot dog on their sign for a reason and if you go there without getting one, well... that is just wack.  

Up until recently I spent a lot of time in that neighborhood and always drove by the previous establishment Soul in the Hole (soul food) and always thought I should try it.  Never did, and it went belly-up.  I wasn't going to make the mistake with Moreno's.  I always wanted to go when the hot dog cart was active.  I grew up in NJ/NY and we sure love our dogs from a cart.

The Sonoran dog is like a Chicago dog in the way they desperately try to cover up and hide the actual dog!  Both are closer to a pig-in-a-blanket than they are a traditional dog.  They also are in the habit of blowing out the bottom of the bun.  In those respects, I cannot consider it the best in the hot dog genre.  However, it is awesomely delicious!  Not exactly sure what is on the thing but I like it.  

Don't judge a hot dog joint on tacos, that's like judging a steakhouse by having fish.  They have a hotdog caballero on their sign people!  Do the smart thing and chomp down on a tasty Sonoran Dog.  

They opened a 2nd location in Tempe which will be my new base for Sonoran dogs.  I have not seen the cart at that one which saddens me but when I'm craving one, I'll make the sacrifice."}
{"text":"Omg the nachos.... Yes.... And the bean dip.... 

Stopped at morenos for a quick lunch. Service was quick! Place got busy for lunch so you know people like it. Hubby and I shared the nachos that came with lots of yummy carne asada and a street taco just to try it. 

Taco was alright. 2.5 stars. 
Everything else is a solid 3. 

It's good! Amazing? Eh, not really but I will be back for these nachos...... Believe it. 

Food 3/5
Price 3/5
Atmosphere and Service 3/5"}
{"text":"Now I haven't tried the food yet because I wasn't very found of the manager and then really her staff. She didn't even crack a smile. It wasn't pleasing. I felt so uncomfortable. They never said please or thank you. Hi how are you. The manager should be more enthusiastic instead of starring at you with this grin on her face and talking super quite. Not comforting at all, made me not want to eat there ha. Sad for them. That's the biggest deal in a restaurant is building relationships so that people want to come back. There not there to spend money , they want to enjoy it. Anyways, they are just not the brightest tools in the box."}
{"text":"I love Gecko Grill and we come to Morenos a lot now that this location serves Geckos menu. The greatest part: their salsa is to die for!! My all time favorite meal is the cheese enchilada with Green sauce with rice but their special chimi is amazing and you need to try it! Or just get that sauce on something!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars.  Waited over 10 minutes the staff could not figure out who was going to take our order. We left made a comment to the hostess but went on deaf ears."}
{"text":"If you're looking for easy, simple Mexican food this is a good local place to go. Nothing fancy but quaint and convenient. Comfortable place to be, low key environment."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly and personable. 

Food is delicious as well. The music is a nice touch."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they have been open !! It's ALWAYS Great, very consistent and the staff is Always friendly & personable.  The FOOD is Excellent, we have tried almost everything on the menu and it's Always prepared like home cooking and very very generous portions.

Just so you know we are very fussy people, eating out I am very critical if deserved and this is probably one out of 20 restaurants I'd give a 5 Star all around the board.  So Amy T., I'm not sure you ate at this restaurant or exactly what the underlying problem really was???  But, my advice is try it again and I know you'll be surprised.

It's always busy, no matter the day or time !!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican good places in the valley located right in the middle of Mexican Mesa (no wonder it's so good).  Their carne a dada burrito is delicious so is their salsa bar!  If your looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place to eat at!"}
{"text":"This place had the worst service and the food is not real Mexican food.  The first person came to ask us for drinks, about 10-15 minutes after we sat down.  We ordered two margaritas and two waters.  Then 15 minutes later the Bartender/Server came, introduced herself, then asked us what we wanted to drink.  I don't know what happened to the first person, she never gave us her name.  So, we reordered 2 margaritas and 2 waters. After waiting 10 minutes, we got our Chips and Salsa, still haven't gotten our water. First of all, the salsa is made from canned tomatoes and it's not spicy at all.  The chips guy dropped a chip on the tray, then put that chip on my chips basket. Needless to say, I will never go back there again. The food is over priced, glorified Taco Bell, and the prices are high for crappy food and bad service."}
{"text":"I usually get it to go but I ate there for the first time. That staff was super nice and caring. One of the staff kindly explain different sauce and help me learn about authentic Mexican Cuisine. Needless to say the food is great! I tried their hibiscus drink for the first time and it was fabulous! I highly highly highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places right now. Everything has been really good. I don't have a favorite thing yet. I love the pictures they have on the menu which always make me hungry but I wish they had take out menus so I could decide before I get there. I always get indecisive at the ordering counter. Too many yummy things to pick from."}
{"text":"Coming from a place where there is mexican food on every couple streets, I have truly missed an authentic mexican restaurant or joint. This place is legit! Good tacos, good burritos, real good non-taco bell mexican! 
If you want some real Mexican food, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Ordered menudo on the phone to go, when I got there I explained I called in the order. They had no orders for menudo, I called the wrong store. The young cashier girl was able to help me very fast, efficient, and very courteous. 

They had no menudo made so it'll be a 15 minute wait. I came back after 15min. Now there's a big line, but the cashier noticed me and just brought the menudo strait to me. I was very happy with the service on a TO GO item. 

The only thing is that place is way way to small. It only seats about 15-20 people and that'll be cluttered."}
{"text":"When I think street tacos, I think Moreno's! I've tried several places, but I always come back to my first love. 

The chicken is the best, all though the carne asada is really good as well. Meat Is never dry, and always tastes fresh. I also love that they have a little bar where you can load up on limes, guacamole and salsa's. And they have whole Jalapeno's. the best!"}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place ! My favorite Mexican restaurant in chandler. We get take out at least once a week now. My daughter loves the grande burrito and I love the shrimp tacos. The staff is super friendly too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Moreno's Mexican on Sunday to pick up some appetizers for our crew. After talking to the manager, Jesus, and hearing the backstory of how Moreno's came to be known for their Sonoran Style hot dogs after humble beginnings as a foodie stop at the local tire shop, I just had to try them. Absolutely delicious! I don't know how they do it but it is bursts of flavor on a Mexican bun. A true Mexican bun, as well. They are imported from Nogales. I was a big fan of their mild (chunky) salsa, bean dip, and queso. The hot was a little too hot for me but my company enjoyed it. The queso had a little kick to it, as well, but just the right amount and it seems tempered by the spinach that is mixed in - plus, you just might fool yourself into thinking it's a tad healthy. Just kidding! 

I will definitely be stopping by again. There is a surprisingly full menu. I heard rave reviews about the Chicken Fajita Burro and the Pollo Fundido. The service was quick, the atmosphere was friendly, they have happy hour specials with Margarita specials between 3-6 pm. There is outdoor seating or you can watch the games on the tv inside. Catering is available, as well."}
{"text":"Trying out the New Mexican joint in South Gilbert. It is right in my neighborhood so I'm disappointed to say that I won't be returning. The service was below acceptable. We had to wait an abnormally long time to receive our food and then it only came out sporadically with our five-year-old being served last. My family was not even finished eating when the server started bringing us boxes and then the check. It was clear that we were being rushed out. Confusing at it is 1 pm on a Sunday and there is plenty of seating.  Unfortunately, the food does not make up for the service. The tortilla soup was oily and overloaded with tortilla strips. The steak burrito was dry and plain. We also order the crab rellanos. The chili was undercooked but deep fried and smothered in an exorbitant amount of cream cheese sauce. It was imitation crab meat and the presentation was very unappetizing.  Bad food and bad service. Bummed."}
{"text":"Been craving Sonoran style favorites in the Phoenix area? Well go to Moreno's and you won't leave disappointed! When I visit Tucson I love getting Sonoran dogs and other specialties like caramelos and vampiros but it can be hard to find them here in the Phoenix area. Moreno's offers all the above in addition to your standard selections you'd find in a typical Mexican restaurant. I had a small size carne asada caramelo and a Sonoran dog. I got the agua de sandia to go with it.

The restaurant is nicely appointed with granite countertops and neutral beige tiles and stone. There is a salsa bar in the center with various salsas, cucumber slices, marinated carrots, and limes. The tables here are evenly spaced out and eating in was a pleasant experience. The order was ready in a short amount of time. The caramelo was quite delicious. It is very similar to a quesadilla except they use two separate tortillas instead of one tortilla folded. The tortillas were perfectly griddled to have a lightly crisp exterior and the carne asada was well seasoned and very tender. The cheese melded well with the rest of the ingredients. The Sonoran dog was a pretty sight to behold, with the different colors of the toppings surrounded by the bolillo roll. It was good, but compared to some fabulous ones I've had in the past the roll wasn't as soft. The roasted white pepper that came with it had a fiery hot kick to it. I loved it. The agua de sandia (Watermelon juice) was so refreshing with the perfect amount of sweetness. I could possibly drink a whole gallon of that stuff!

Service was very friendly with a smile.

If I'm in the area again this is definitely a great place for Mexican food.

4.5/5"}
{"text":"10/10 would not recommend lol well idk I guess some other people have lower standards of Mexican food but to me this place was sooooooo bad 

We came on a Wednesday evening at 5:45

The service: SLOW AF, really bad, inconsistent, rude, forgetful, slow af...... No one brought us waters and we'd been there for like 20 minutes, my husband goes up to the counter where all the employees were chatting and this bitch gives him a side eye and says someone is getting the water for you BUT BIH IT PLEASE TELL ME DID THEY HAVE TO HIKE THE HIMALAYAN MOUNTAINS AND COLLECT THE FRESH DEW OFF THE LEAVES DROP BY DROP

They brought one water out

Omfg there was five of us

Whatever k 

My parents got margaritas- said they're just mediocre 

Chicken enchiladas- no seasoning on the meat 

Carne asada- the meat is cut up already and is DRY DRY DRY I know this is the desert but DAMN that shit needed halppppp

Fajitas- my parents said they were pretty basic and \"just alright\"

Salsa was weird tasting but chips were good. They get a star for the chips I guess. I'd never come back but I do wanna try their breakfast, just once man. \"Do it for the updated review\" I gotchu fam. Tbh it just intrigues me actually. So we'll see lol"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos are amazing and inexpensive. The bean and cheese burrito was great, their beans are phenomenal, and the salsa is very tasty! Will definitely be going again!!"}
{"text":"Southwestern Shrimp Burro was delicious. Ate here three times so far and will continue to go. Food is good, the staff is friendly, and the price is right!"}
{"text":"First timers. I had the Tampiquena. Lots of meat, seasoned well and tender. Hubby had the Seafood Grande. DELICIOUS.  Service was fast, friendly and plates were HOT..  We even went at lunch time. Coronas were icy cold. Had mini chimis w/jalapeno cream cheese as appetizer.  Brought some home for dinner tonight.  Don't be too quick to write them off.  We thought they are better than Tacos n' More on Higley & Germann.  Perhaps the real picky people need to prepare their Mexican food at home.         A great dining experience."}
{"text":"Had Lengua taco. It was good but tiny. Girlfriend's taco was also tiny, she said smallest tacos she has ever seen. However, the Sonora Dogs were great. They have extra sauce and sliced pork or other meat, great combo. Very messy and great. The other customers had big portions, so tacos only item appears to be small. Would definitely come back, especially for the sonora dog."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I liked their chips and green salsa. They also had a bean dip and red salsa for the tortilla chips. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito which was yummy. I think they should have a bigger container for the salsas. They were pretty skimpy compared to the size of  the chips and we finished it off before the chips which was a little disappointing. I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"It's good food. BUT I feel like certain things are overpriced for the quality. Got a green cheese enchilada plate and the sauce they use is definitely from a can. Learned my lesson but I don't believe it's worth $12 and some change for two cheese enchiladas and a small amount of rice and beans that all could've been cooked homemade ."}
{"text":"I had the Mexican hot dog.  The dog was boiled not grilled.  The bacon was bacon bits sprinkled on top.  The \"bun\" was cold as were most of the toppings which quickly cooled down my dog to lukewarm.  My friend had the chicken stuffed burrito and she said it seemed like the chicken was boiled also.  My other friend did enjoy the tortilla soup and beef taco.  And everything but the soup was served on styrofoam.  I am so Not a fan of styrofoam."}
{"text":"So far-- the best Sonoran dog I've had in the Valley (besides home made). The adobada caramelo was filling! Hoping Tempe can be a new spot for them to expand to!"}
{"text":"This isn't the place I just have to go to each time I think Mexican, but the food and service is good! The bean dip is great to say the least, I just wish they wouldn't charge you for such a little thing of it. 

The service is friendly and fast. Food comes out piping hot every time! I feel like they could kick up the seasoning a bit, but that is just personal opinion, the food is still good. I come here at least once a month for lunch and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Really good food. Food truck and patio..very quick and so fresh. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Great chips and salsa. The food was good. It came in super large portions. For the price it was a great deal. I got a burrito and it was 3 meals for me for $11. Looking forward to eating here once we move."}
{"text":"I had to give these guys the rating they deserve, I'm shocked their rating is so low. Mesa people obviously don't know good Mexican food when they get it. I guess after being deprived for years and thinking \"Nando's\" constitutes Mexican food Moreno's may be a bit of a culture shock. Not only is the food fresh and delicious I've yet to be disappointed by this place and let me tell you, from steakhouses to food trucks, good food is my forte. Taco Toro is probably the best taco you can get in AZ, not just Mesa, I'm going bold enough to say AZ. Soft homemade corn tortilla, Anaheim green Chile, your choice of meat (my choice is Carne Asada), beans, cheese = Taco Perfection. We used to have to drive to their west Mesa local so I was ecstatic to get this spot closer to home, great for my tummy, not my waist line. Service is eh, you come here for the food, not the service. If you want to complain about service, don't be cheap and go to a fine dining restaurant, this is casual - know the difference. Other faves are the Sonoran Dog, any of the burros - wet, Chile Rellenos (all of them) and the Ceviche... I know, seafood at a hole in the wall can be scary, but trust me #worthit #treatyoself obviously,  top it all off with a Mexican Coke or an Horchata and a churro, because you donut want to miss out on your Mexi-donut (see what I did there?)"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was again perfect!  Had their street taco's and just loved them.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"They have a bunch of breakfast burritos but they're not on the menu!! Had the 'California' which had pretty much every filling. Very good. Big for the money. The Sonoran Dog was tasty as well. Nice salsa bar (4 salsas - one moderately spicy)."}
{"text":"Open 7 days a week 9am-11pm. 

Adobada toro (supreme) taco. $1.99 and the best taco I've ever had. Most menu items are a tad on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. 

Amazing salsa bar (but taking off one star for their not being one with much heat). Love the free cucumbers and carrots.

Friendly staff.

Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Today we decided to give Moreno's a try and had our first Sonoran hot dogs! In case you're like us and have never had one, it's a hot dog wrapped in bacon which was topped with chopped tomato, onions, pinto beans, salsa, chilies, ketchup, mustard, and mayo all nestled into a light as air, fluffy bun. We both really enjoyed them! Also I'm really big on having house made chips and salsa so we got a side of that so I could give it a try. The salsa was great! Nice texture, flavor and spiciness. However the chips were...eh. I wish they made them from scratch or at least bought better quality, more authentic chips. These reminded me of something you would find at any grocery store. The place was clean and festive inside, and the staff were friendly enough. We'll go back so we can try some of their other items."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and their hot dogs have never disappointed. I have yet to try anything else on their menu so I can't really comment on anything else but if you are looking for a good hot dog at any time of the day I highly recommend these. They're open until 1:00am during the weekend as well!"}
{"text":"I came here for the Sonoran hot dogs, which are pretty yummy. Not El Guero Canelo yummy, but good enough to hold off the craving until the next trip to Tucson.
I also ordered the carne asada torta, that was muy buena ijuesu!

They have Mexican soda in bottles. Ample parking and friendly cashiers.
If you are even in that area of Chandler, stop by for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Very nice, family atmosphere.  Sister establishment of Gecko Grill on Baseline.  Here for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Had the crab stuffed chili relleno and it was fantastic.  Not sure how this place can be so affordable and so good at the same time.  Service was fast and polite.  I'll come back again"}
{"text":"I've had my share of really good, slap your nana good Mexican food. This wasn't it. Granted, I only had a fried ice cream and horchata, but the chips and salsa lacked flavor and the icecream was far overpriced for what you got.
The whole reason I'm actually writing a review, however, isn't because of the flavor of the food, but rather the atrocious service we received. First off, when we walked in, we didn't know that it was essentially an open seating, so we stood at the cashier looking like schmucks. It took about 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, and we still were never greeted.
Our server was the cherry on the pie. Took 10 minutes to get us our drink (order) & once he realized we were only getting dessert, he quickly turned rude & short with us. I get that as a server you are working for tips, so a smaller bill would be less important, but you never know how much you could actually get from someone.

Suffice to say, I don't plan on going back, at least (for damn sure) not to this location."}
{"text":"Quality wasn't there, felt like I got ripped off! Had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans really had no flavor. Would never go back first and last."}
{"text":"Chandler has been good to us. Food has been excellent. We tried Moreno's. It was very busy at lunch. We tried two favorites - the Sonoran Style Hot Dog and the Three carne asada taco plate. Both were fabulous. Hot, fresh and friendly service. Clean restaurant. Appears to have a lot of good choices and specially."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for the last 2 months and finally decided to give it a shot! I always like to try Sonoran dogs when they're on a menu since I'm from Tucson and loooooooooove Sonoran dogs!! These dogs were DELICIOUS!! The buns were really good and the toppings were fresh and yummy. I ordered them to go and was pleasantly surprised to find chips and salsa thrown in too! BONUS! Would definitely go back to try more things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"I have downloaded this Yelp App just to leave this review.  

It's completely frustrating that we have been coming to the Gilbert location for a year because they offered veggies that other locations did not.

Tonight the Manager said they have never had them . Completely incorrect . Our meal was missing and incorrect.

We are so frustrated with the lack of competence and service at this location . 

Don't bother coming to this one if you like Morenos . There is a better staff at the Higley/chandler heights location."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food!  Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.  This is the furthest from authentic Mexican as you can get.  Everything is dry as a bone no matter how much sauce you put on it. The tortilla soup was seriously canned chicken broth, dry shredded chicken and a ton of diced avocado I guess that made it look authentic.  The staff are friendly high schoolers but have zero sense of urgency. My food and my kids food came first and we waited 10 minutes for my husbands food.  Found the server standing behind the counter joking and laughing with his friends as our food sat under the heat lamp.   The nachos with Chicken were so dry my kids would not eat them and they pretty much eat anything!  We sent them back only to be charged $2 dollars for a side of sour cream!  Are you kidding??!!The tamales were over cooked and dried out.  I mean seriously this place has such amazing potential - get the food and the service in order and it's a keeper."}
{"text":"Great job!! Queso Dip was awesome. I also had the burrito with mixed meat and added fresh jalapenos. Very tasty for take out. Friendly manager.
Parking is a pain for location.
Thanks,

{"text":"Pretty standard fare, but delivery definitely sets them apart in Tempe."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed by the food, the service is another story. We have to be extra careful when getting take out because they have given us the wrong order and have left out items. Otherwise, the food has always been amazing."}
{"text":"Came because the Best of Phoenix issue told me to.  After contemplating whether to take my daughter to the restaurant next to Club Tattoo, we entered the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen.  I think it is supposed to look like a dive with bricks showing through the walls, but it is just too clean.  The chips were fresh and salty and the salsa was runny and spicy; both delicious.  I order the pollo fundido to see what a fundido is.  After filling up on chips, my daughter ate one-fourth of my fundido (sans pollo because she is vegetarian), her beans, and none of her quesadilla.  The guacamole was fresh and the other three-fourths of the fundido tasted great.  The service was also great.  So if you are looking for some delicious, inexpensive Mexican food served really fast and in a clean restaurant, Moreno is your grill."}
{"text":"Happy to find such good food so close to home. Try the Pollo Fundido or the Carne Asada tacos. They do serve Pepsi, but otherwise it's a great place. ;)  The chips come with two types of salsa and warm bean dip. Michael is a great server, so sit in his section if you have a chance."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars! I've been here 3 times and it's really, REALLY good. Cheese enchilada with green sauce and bean tostada is where it's at. Good queso and chips, pollo fundido (or whatever they call it here. I can't remember), fish tacos and arroz con pollo. That's what we've tried so far. It was all delicious. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Great food and great service tonight. Thanks folks! Hubby had the taco salad and I had the seafood grande, my favorite."}
{"text":"You know in Mesa there should be a ton of sit down Mexican places.  But surprisingly there isn't; good ones anyway.  Moreno's is one that we like a ton.  It's become our go to lately.  Food is fresh, service is good and chips and salsa are really good."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Chandler to be sure. Looking forward to trying the entire menu."}
{"text":"Great chips salsa and bean dip! Awesome soda and great service! This is my favorite Mexican food place in Arizona! I highly recommend their Gecko quesadilla with shredded chicken! Family friendly and affordable prices!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the atmosphere & service was HORRIBLE!!! The orders were wrong, we had to ask twice for chips & asked 3 times for boxes."}
{"text":"Fresh food!!  Very accommodating on any food allergies/restrictions.  Friendly,  and clean.  Worth paying a little more for the quality!  Delicious breakfast,  I'll write again after I try their lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I cannot believe what I was served here! I ordered the mini Chimis. The chicken ones were ok but a little plain. The beef ones, on the other hand, were freaking MOLDY! I can't freaking believe it. I was very upset. It seems as though I am not going to get sick from this (its been about 10 hours since I ate there and I feel fine). The waiter was nice and comped us the meal."}
{"text":"Delicious tender shredded beef in my taco salad. Family had chicken taco and said it was delicious. The chips and salsa were great.  Nice people. Fast service"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Our newest favorite Mexican food!  The staff is all wonderful and always say hello and good by!  The soup is great and comes in a huge portion.  I love the sea food chimis. My hubby always has the combo #1.  They also rock for breakfast!"}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine was talking about Sonoran dogs which I have tried at farmers markets and Sir Vezas. I told him of my disappointment at paying close to $8 for Sonoran dogs only to have them fall apart forcing me to eat them with a fork and knife. He suggested Moreno's, not only for the dog but good Mexican food in general. 

I was not disappointed, only $3.25 for the best Sonoran dog I have had yet but the asada street taco combo was also solid. I am so glad my co-worker told me about Moreno's because I have been driving by it everyday for the past 3 years wondering if the food was any good.

Service is really quick and the food is fresh not greasy. Prices are very reasonable compared to most Mexican places and the portions are also reasonable. Several locations in the Valley, consider dropping in before you head to Taco Hell or other fast food Mexican place."}
{"text":"Food was very good and different than most cookie cutter Mexican restaurants. The ambiance left room for improvement as the music was too loud and they should NOT allow people to bring their DOGS into the establishment."}
{"text":"Reminds me of home cooked meals. Had their Huebos Rancheros. And they hit the spot. It's the only thing I have tried, but if they can get that right, everything else on the menu should be just as good. Other places I have gone have been a bad experience. Only thing bad is it's too far away from my place. Lol."}
{"text":"Great Bean dip and chips!  Good version of street tacos."}
{"text":"We first noticed this place because of the  trailer out front with an  led sign saying TACOS. My girlfriend had a coupon for a free breakfast with the purchase of an equal or lesser value entree.  So we went...

We were surprised at the inside, it was clean and bright with nice full bar and a patio.  It is too hot right now for the patio, so we sat inside.  We were greeted very nicely and the server, Jaziel (pronounced ha-siel, we asked) greeted us quickly and took our drink order, and the chips followed immediately.  

I am a Huevos Rancheros snob and rarely find a place that does it properly.  So I ordered it and it was very good and done properly.  The problem is that most places don't make a real Rancheros sauce.  Instead throwing Pico De Gallo on it or enchilada sauce.  This was a true Ranchero sauce, runny with bits of fresh onion and bell peppers in it. The only negative is that it could have been spicier, but it is a gringo restaurant, so I can forgive that.  It was still delicious.  

My girlfriend ordered the spinach and mushroom omelette.  She was halfway through it when Jaziel came up and apologized for the mistake.  We didn't know what they were talking about and it turns out they gave her a Tomato and Mushroom Omelette.  She had been wondering where the spinach was but hadn't really given it much thought because what they gave her was so good.  So it was a pleasant mistake.  No problem at all.

The salsa they gave us with the chips was a chunky red and a mild green.  The Green was a bit too sweet and the red was mild, but had decent flavor.  After we were done with the meal my girlfriend asked about hotter salsas.  It turns out the have 3 other spicy salsas, a green and 2 reds.  We will ask for those next time we go in.  

We also looked at the dinner menu and saw some really great sounding entrees like a Crab Relleno and a Salmon Enchilada, sounds yummy.

We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I usually eat out with my boyfriend and he's very picky about Mexican food since he is Mexican. I thought the tacos were decent. Doesn't taste like the at home authentic Mexican tacos. The horchata, rice, and beans were good though. I would come back and try their Sonoran hot dogs everyone raves about."}
{"text":"A little disapointed.  Husband got a Mixta Carmelo and I got a California Burrito.  He liked his a lot. Mine was too salty and a little chewy.  And, I can take down a bag of chips.  Yeah, we're white people from Iowa and West Virginia.  But, we've purposely stayed away from huge chains and tried many mexican places in our 3 years here.  Very willing to try other items from here."}
{"text":"The food was so salty that had I not has a slushy that was full of sugar I probably couldn't have eaten it. They messed all three of our orders up... Twice. I just wasn't impressed. There's a lot better Mexican food in AZ. Last time I was here it was good but this time completely missed the mark."}
{"text":"Sigh. Service and quality had been pretty good the first few times we stopped at Moreno's. Today, however, our food was delivered to someone else and the staff never noticed. The best the could offer was a sorry. The food was okay so it isn't a one star review."}
{"text":"- Quick and pleasant service
- The bean dip is very tasty (although $.99 for probably two tablespoons is a little odd)
- The red salsa is good
- Not a fan of the green salsa.  I like spicy salsa, not sweet and usually green is spicy
- The shredded beef tacos were delicious, as were the rice and beans
- Good prices and value"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time! The food is always great but our service tonight was exceptional. Our server Michael was professional, nice and very efficient. We see Michael there all the time and he is always working hard and has a smile on his face! I had the shrimp and mango salsa, lettuce wrapped tacos which are a great healthy option! I love this Moreno's location, it's the spot to go for fresh, authentic Mexican food!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday.  We were seated right away and had chips and three kinds of salsa brought to our table immediately.  Our friends had a mojito and a margarita and said they were both very good ( good enough to have 2 each). 
My wife had the salmon tacos and I had the Sonoran hot dog.  Both were excellent.  He had the burrito and she had the shrimp street tacos. Again, both excellent.  Although it was busy with only one waitress Jessica did a great job of keeping everyone served.  We would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time here and my family and I had a great experience. We were greeted upon arrival by everyone. Abby was our waitress. She was very pleasant and always smiling. I'm very picky but Abby got everything perfect. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"One of the few places to eat if you live in this area ... good food, good service!! Love coming here for a quick, yummy dinner!!"}
{"text":"The pollo fundido was very yummy. For this price point it exceeded my expectations.  Although exterior bathroom was inconvenient."}
{"text":"My family and I attended for a late lunch. We chose Moreno's because we originally planned to go to Gordo's down the street, but it was closed. I was pleasantly amazed on how great it was. From the complimentary chips, the 2 types of salsa(green and red) and beans for the dipping of the chips. The green salsa was to die for. I'm not a salsa eater to begin with, but this green salsa was magical to my taste buds. Usually beans served as a complimentary dip, are made with hot spices. This bean dip isn't and my 8.5 month enjoyed the dip as much as his dad did (I'm not a bean eater.) The green salsa and my son being able to eat the bean dip, was a plus. The staff is pleasant, but our waiter was asked a few times to refill our Sprite and Lemonade and paper napkins. It can be a little messy with an 8.5 month and bean, ya know lol. I got the Chicken Fondido, my little got the kid's cheese quesadilla plate, and the partner got Adobado Burrito. Everything overall was really good. We will definitely go back for the food!"}
{"text":"Dos estrellas.

My review has been fed into Yahoo! Babelfish Text Translation...twice.  First English to Spanish, then Spanish to English:

Not more than two stars. It ate the tacos of fish, #6. combined. The fish was exaggerated and oily and now I have a pain the belly. The rice was good, the beans was hardly acceptable. My daughter ate enchilada of the cheese. She was just very well also. My wife had kidney beans of the rice and the swindle of the flutes. Once again two to star worthy. Moreno' s does not come until now near my hole preferred in the Mexican restaurant of the wall, Mess orderly from in the boulevard of the chandler hardly to the east of the 10. Grieved, as soon as can' t recommends east place.

The original:

No more than two stars.  I had fish tacos, combo #6.  The fish was overdone and oily and now I have a tummy ache.  The rice was good, the beans were just ok.
My daughter had a cheese enchilada.  It was just ok as well.  My wife had flautas con arroz y frijoles.  Again, two star worthy.  
Moreno's does not come close to my favorite hole in the wall Mexican restaurant so far, El Ranchero on Chandler Boulevard just east of the 10.
Sorry, just can't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Sorry my fellow gringos, this place is horrible and the solo gringo clientele says it all. There's nothing about the place that's authentic, ok, maybe some of the staff but the food is HORRIBLE!! Fortunately a three hour drive south totally unnecessary to find MUCH MUCH better comida mexicana. VERY DISAPPOINTED. ONLY good thing, staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a taco and burrito (asada) but compared to generic California taquerias, I'd give Moreno's a 2 for food and price but I give the staff a 4, so I'm going with the middle road and giving 3 stars.

The salsa bar is pretty medicore.

Parking is okay"}
{"text":"Our first time at Morenos. AWESOME Mexican Food. Two (of best tacos I've had in long time) rice & beans $8,49 great specials like Wed $1.99/tacos. Chen them out. (S.W. Corner Gilbert & Germann in Chandler, AZ)"}
{"text":"Well, it is what it is. A small mexican restruant with quick service and sub par food.  But today, I did have a little hidden treat not many people may know about.  Try the hot dogs....

So the menu is in Spanish, but I heard the hot dogs are good.  I order two and have a coke.  Price is great.  I go and sit down, and wait.... and wait.... and wait.  Finally I ask and oops, we forgot your order cause it was busy. OK, besides the 20 minute delay, nothing wrong with this place at all.  Very cozy actually.  And the hot dogs were solid! A little bigger than a regular dog, the jalepino relish was a surprisingly good topper. PLUS they serve Mexican coke in the bottles which for the unknowing means pure cane sugar.

The rest of the food I don't know about. I'll have to write an update on that.  But as far as the hot dogs go, A-Ok by me."}
{"text":"Went back again today. Sonoran hot dogs were still good, but not up to Tucson standards. Torta, not so good. Tacos, decent, but nothing special. Our initial order was wrong. Our second order was also wrong. Still worth the trip since it is one of the only places in the Valley doing Sonoran hot dogs, but there are many places better for Sonoran Mexican food overall. Oh, the fried ice cream was excellent. Large portions for a good price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to the Phoenix area from Cleveland. We have been looking forward to trying the Mexican food around here. We ordered Moreno's through UberEats since we are still getting settled in to our new home. We expected it to be average Mexican, but we were very pleasantly surprised. I had the Carne Asada Grande Burrito, and he had the Enchiladas (carne asada and cheese). Both portions were too much for us to finish. They also include complimentary chips and salsa. We have not yet dined at the restaurant, so I can't say much in terms of service. However, the UberEats delivery was quick, and our food was still warm. We will definitely order Moreno's again."}
{"text":"First visit was a couple weeks ago. I got 2 tacos (carne asada & chicken), my son got a chicken chimichanga and I ordered a side of chips & salsa. 
All the food was delicious! The chicken in the tacos was so tender and the salsa was amazing. I actually stopped there today just to buy some to have at home!
Will definitely be back to try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our place to go. Little did I forget how much they enjoy ripping you off.  I will never go back. How can you spend $25 on food and they say you can only have 2 small salsas by small I mean it will be done in one taco.  You have to pay for more. Oh ok so when you buy your entire family dinner what only one person gets salsa! I was beyond pissed and paid for more which gave me another two small amounts.  This is ridiculous! I'm done ordering twice a month from a place who treats customers like this!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in chandler! The original one is the only one that I will now go to! After ordering 6 tacos, 2 hotdogs and a burrito they legit give you 2 small ass salas.  When I mean small I mean 2 ounces!!! How the hell do you even do that!  I have to pay for more Salas and oh surprise surprise they again only give you two!  This place will no longer get my business. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Was seated very fast.  Moreno's celebrating Cinco De Mayo.  Mariachi band performing every Saturday night.  Will definitely be back so we can sit closer.  Excellent combo #2.  Make this a stop on your list."}
{"text":"We love this place- street tacos and loaded bacon wrapped hot dogs are really good but my favorite is the cheese enchiladas! Rice and beans are delicious too, and my husband always gets different burritos and is always happy with them too."}
{"text":"Had the charbroiled fish taco again last night and again it was absolutely awesome! A hearty fresh  fish taco."}
{"text":"Food is average.  Service is less than standard. Young kids running the operation.  Save your money and stop at Del Taco.  Place was dirty trash on floor tables left with dirty dishes-- won't go back"}
{"text":"Funny staff! Friendly, efficient, cheap, and amazing food!! The food is amazing quick, and tastes amazing! The service is quite good! If you are looking for good Mexican this is the place to go. We tend to be Mexican snob's and this place definitely hits the nail!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good...love the tortillas. Always came for lunch but tried breakfast today. Not disappointed! Had the Hash browns your way...soooo good. Our server was Laura and made the recommendation when I couldn't decide. Hubby had the Huevos Mexicanos also her recommendation. Good also. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"1st few visits fantastic service and food. This time today not so much. My shredded beef hard tacos weren't filled with much other than lettuce and tomato. Rice was hard and beans not so hot. Hopefully just an off day/morning."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time and money on this place. We were excited to promote a new restaurant in the neighborhood. I do understand there are growing pains when opening up a new location but this is an established restaurant. The food was bland...nothing special. My daughter, wife, and I ordered an entree each. All three of our meals came at different times. My food came out first. I was done eating by the time my wife's food came. After complaining twice about not getting my daughter's food it finally arrived when my wife was half done with her dinner. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Fresh food, friendly and accommodating staff. The food is made to order and is authentic. My favorite item here is the Sonoran Hot Dog with all of the toppings. Hot dog buns are tasty and fluffy."}
{"text":"Really yummy lunch today.,it was my first visit, and the place was so clean! Everything looked really fresh, and all the hot sauces were delicious. I ordered a burrito, and loved it. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Worst Sonoran hot dog I have ever had there was barely any beans or bacon. But loaded with tomatoes and onions. I would rather travel to the Queen Creek location then come back here again"}
{"text":"My first time and my last at the location. The services is absolutely terrible. The beans they brought with the salsa was good but cold.

 As soon as I placed my order i was completely forgotten bye my server. When she brought the food she just sat in at my table not saying a word and walked away and never came back.

 I had to flag Down the bus boy to get more salsa. I was only giving one napkin for a whole mean and chips and salsa smh. I would have asked for more but all the servers were just hanging out on the side talking.

 In the whole 45min I have been here the only interaction with your employees was placing my order and them dropping off my food and not saying a word. I will never come back to back to this location. 

I normally go the the queen creek location witch has phenomenal customer service I live in Mesa and I pacifically drive there. Sad to see sacia no longer works there etheir. She was my favorite server. She was always so kind and personable and on top of all her tables. 

I'm willing to give Morenos another try but only the queen creek location sad to i just got a job in the same complex and though this would be my go to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I swear the only good marranos is the one in Queen Creek. I ordered horchata and when I got it it tasted so watered down it was absolutely disgusting worst $3 I've ever spent my Lance I definitely won't be back this location to eat if they can't even do a drink right."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the service is the worst. Even went back several times to give it another shot & STILL horrible. Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Moreno's is a tasty reminder of living in Tucson. Their Sonoran Dogs are good enough to calm my cravings, but not nearly as good as El Guero Canelo. That said, a dog or two and a cold horchata makes for a perfect lunch.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There is no good mexican food in Tempe....well thats what I would say before Morenos came to town. YES, YES, YES!!! Horchata in a big jug behind the counter, YES! Cabeza chimichangas, YES! Blaring mexican music outside, YES!"}
{"text":"Great food, I look be the sonogram hot dogs and they have the best Flan ever. The atmosphere is great and the staff was super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great service is horrible!! Everytime we go here we have to wait and wait for anyone to acknowledge us. I don't understand how there are 5 servers standing at the front chit chatting but no one is serving? And to top it off when one of them is asked to serve us they just rolled their eyes?!! It's really a shame because the food is delicious but I'm tired of feeling unwanted and/or invisible."}
{"text":"The best green chili burritos! I live in North Phoenix and I have driven all the way out to Moreno's just to get a couple burritos. You must try them. They are unlike anything I have had anywhere else, and I have been trying my best to replicate them with no luck. The Sonoran hot dogs are also very good! It's well worth the 45 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times because it is super convenient and because of all of the awesome reviews, but after each visit i was not impressed. I'm not having an unrealistic expectation but the food didn't taste authentic at all. I would compare this to a filibertos, it tastes like fast food. For some good authentic mexican food I would skip this one."}
{"text":"Good food, had Gecko burrito. Chips and red salsa was tasty. Burrito could have been hotter, warmth, serving dish was very hot but burrito was not. Would consider returning if in the area again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite. No menus per se, menu boards and a TV monitor that has combo meals with NO descriptions, not sure what's what. I ended up ordering Morenos burrito combo with pork...pork was cubed but over cooked and a bit tough. No chips or salsa, no ice tea (what gives). 

The place has few tables and some uncomfortable bench seat booths, really odd. 

Best 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I'm an Elmer's Tacos fan.  I tried Moreno's asada and adovada tacos, and... if you put a big piece of gristle and fat up in my taco, I cant help but notice it as it slows my molar's roll.  You really jack up a taco by doing that... seeing as the tacos aint that big to begin with.

I did like the sonoran dog, but it was a little clumsy to eat, with the toppings spilling all over my baboso shorts.  Also... weren't a fan of the oversized pepper that its served with.  But the avocado sauce at the salsa bar is pretty good"}
{"text":"We have been coming for Moreno's for years!

For delicious authentic Mexican food for a good price come eat here.

My favorite is the Tejano burrito with beef. It has a mild spice to it since there is a green chile with cheese in it that has so much flavor. 

Can't go wrong with any of the dishes."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years! 

My favorite is the tejano burrito with beef. It has cheese with a huge chili in it!

The dishes with rice and beans is also a winner..

The Jamaica is also refreshing here!

Today we are keeping it simple with a breakfast, tocino burrito!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Horrible service and the cleaning supplies they use are absolutely horrible. They should reconsider that.

The Shrimp Quesidilla, Mixed Burrito and the Sonoran Hot Dogs. All bomb!!"}
{"text":"This one is not nearly as good as the newer one on Gilbert and Germann. We tried this one because the other one was so good. This one, not so much. If you want Mexican in this area stick to Elmers Tacos or the Tortas place."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The service sometimes slow. We had Sweet Corn tamales and Sonoran hot dogs and it was delicious. They give you 2 salsas and been dip with the chips.  I also love that they offer seafood and vegetarian options and that they serve a frozen margarita $2 off during happy hr. 
We work from home so it is our take out lunch at least once a week"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Service could be better, but since it is new and there were a lot of people being trained, hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"My brother and I were missing home, south Tucson.  Specifically the tacos and caramelos. They were tasty. Next time we're having some Sonoran dogs"}
{"text":"Excellent food...  Horrible service, both at this location and the one in queen creek.  It's a shame because the food is good!   So far,  we've ordered eat in and eat out,  yet they never gave us the to go order.  On another visit,  my wife ordered a to go,  she waited patiently for 30 minutes....  Not once did anyone ask her if she needed anything,  what she was waiting for,  chips and salsa,  a drink,  etc...  Her order,  she found out,  had been waiting for her for awhile,  and was cold by the time she got home.  Another time,  we had someone bring us chips,  another person took our order,  another person brought our order,  had to ask a random server for a refill,  then had to go to the counter to ask for the check.  We watched \"our server\" leaning comfortably on the counter for quite awhile.  Hopefully,  they'll start hiring better staff who are in tune with their environment, or does it start with the person hiring?  Management? Owner?"}
{"text":"I called to get take out 30 min before they closed according to their website, some rude girl said they were already closed. I asked if they closed at 10:30 like it said on their website and she said \"we are closed\" and hung up on me.  Very rude and unprofessional. Must be related to the owner or manager or she would be fired by now after reading all the other similar comments. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Was looking for some good carne asada tacos, thought I'd yelp a place close to home.

Found this place and UGH, so disappointed. I should have known it was to good to be true when I saw how much the tacos were. But decided to give it a try anyway. When our tacos came they were a little bigger than a half dollar coin. The meat didn't have any flavor, and ALL the salsas they offered were MILD. MILD! I couldn't believe it. I asked the girl putting more limes at the salsa bar which salsa I should use for the tacos she says \"I don't know, I don't like any of them.\" WTF!? Are you serious??? I ended up just using the Tapatio at the table to get any kind of heat or flavor in my tacos.

If your looking for good tacos, your better off at a Sonoran hot dog/ taco truck in Phoenix. Will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Pretty average mexican food , got a couple corn tortilla tacos and they were below average , enchilada was ok. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Went to morenos for the first time and it was great! Probably my favorite mexican place now.  The chips and salsa could have used some more salt, but otherwise, exiting was great. The tacos and the moreno burrito i had were so good. The red and green sauce was perfect. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on mu son's recommendation. I bought a green chili tamale, carne asada taco, a strawberry margarita, and a churro. Churro was delicious and fresh, margarita was so-so, taco was ok, and tamale was store bought and very small and hard. Won't EVER come here again!"}
{"text":"Good food! Have been searching for a reasonable Mexican restaurant in tempe for a while now. The first time I drove by I didn't stop because it didn't look like a sit down restaurant. After reading some yelp reviews I decides to give it a go. I am glad I did. It was priced very fairly. Their specials are awesomely priced, and very tastey.  Great rolled tacos with rice and beans. Pretty good salsa too. Little upset at the lack of free chips/salsa, but overall a dinner for two and chips was under $20. I'll take that any day of the week. I plan to return soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had one of his cravings for some Sonoran hotdogs, I'm not a fan of hot dogs AT ALL.. But it was one of those compromise while in a relationship moments so I played nice and went along. They do have a lot of food to choose from besides the hotdogs and I tried a chicken taco as well as a pork torta and both were pretty decent. 

I can't speak on behalf of the hotdogs but the smile on his face while slumped on the couch with his hand on his belly was a good enough indication that he was very happy and enjoyed them."}
{"text":"We love visiting this location and have never had a bad meal or any issue with service. Thank you so much for all of your hard work to make you customers feel welcome. We frequently bring out of town guests here and they always ask for a return visit when coming back."}
{"text":"I am updating my review and changing my rating due to my experience yesterday. I decided to try Taco Tuesday and had the pork and chicken street tacos. The food was great, the service was excellent. I wasn't to try the lettuce wrap tacos and shrimp tacos on my next visit. They do have a salsa bar so you can select a small variety of salsas. I would call this casual dining and takeout- not fast food. There is quite a bit of seating and everything is made fresh. It's more than an express pick up station- although several customers had called ahead to pick up their orders, there were several people eating inside. This is called Morelos Express/ a fast food place. We went off the review ms and thought it was a nice sit down place and it is not- it's a express pick up location"}
{"text":"I Don't know what has happened with this restaurant we have been eating here for a while.. couple days ago my husband and I went for lunch I order a couple tacos and my husband ordered the street tacos the waitress asked what he wanted on it and asked for a little bit of guacamole and cheese only ok came out it was ok* when we went to pay for our check he was charged for the 4 street tacos wich we New the price in that.. BUT REALLY $7.00 for guacamole and $3.00 for cheese.. My husband and I were not aware of this would be a extra charge or he definitely would of never ordered the toppings..When I asked the waitress I figured it might of been a misunderstanding she was like nope that's the prices.. She told me Iam sorry the prices have went up.. We decided to ask the Manager he was like nope sorry there is nothing I can do that's our prices so need to say that will be our last visit along with a lot more friends I know $23.00 for my husbands meal total $40 for lunch for two and oh yeah I had a kids meal.. Be AwAre of what you order cause you never know that little topping could double the price of your meal!!! Great Way To Scam Your Customers Morenos!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food at a good price. Service is friendly and prompt. This is a regular stop."}
{"text":"I like this Morenos. Haven't tried the other location, so I have nothing to compare it to. 
The bean dip is like crack!  I absolutely adore their green chili sauce they bring out with the chips is incredible.  I love it!  It's a bit sweet, so it might not be some people's idea of green chili, but I really love it.

I have gotten a bean burrito, shredded beef taco, and shrimp ceviche in the times I've been here.  All really good.

The service has always been nice.  My only wish is that the music wasn't so loud.  I'm usually coming there on my lunch break, and I really appreciate going to a place that's quiet.  Oh well.

I recommend this Morenos.  I find their food and service reliable.  Enjoy that bean dip!"}
{"text":"It was good....had the sonoran dog...well average. I had better hot dogs at costco. The tacos were good. Not much of a memorable place plus it is very small."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU THINK THIS IS THE SAME AS THE MORENOS IN MESA.

I was in the area and about to stop at the Chipotle down the street, but I flipped a u-turn once I saw the sign for Morenos. $3.89 for a regular soft carne asada taco?! Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same company as the Morenos in Mesa on Broadway road?? Their tacos are less than $2 each and oh so delicious... I haven't even eaten my food and am already upset. 3 tacos for $11.67+tax... That would've gotten me a burrito bowl at Chipotle along with a drink and maybe chips. I guess they overcharge for \"authentic\" carne asada tacos when selling them in a mostly new and white neighborhood. 

I'm normally not one to rant or even give reviews, but as someone who's tried authentic tacos all over the valley, that didn't rub me the right way. There's not even a salsa bar!!! The green salsa had no hint of spice, it almost tasted sweet. To add to the disappointment, these are not authentic carne asada tacos. They come with shredded cheese, guacamole, and pico. Real street tacos usually just come with cilantro and onions. 

Needless to say, it's a good thing I live not too far from the Mesa location, because I will never be back and don't recommend it. Too overpriced and not tasty."}
{"text":"This is a really great taco stand style place.  While the fact that you order at the counter, and the look of the menu they have displayed may remind you of Filibertos' or any other [fill in the blank]bertos' restaurant, the comparison ends there.  

The place itself is decorated very nicely, with a modern touch, as well as a Mexican influence.  There's a salsa bar with a variety of salsas and spicy vegetables that is properly maintained so it doesn't look like everything has been sitting out for a week like you see in some other places.

I've been there twice so far, and have only tried two things.  Carne asado tacos and a carne asada burrito.  I think you can judge if a Mexican food restaurant is good by the quality of their carne asada.  In this case their carne asada is really top notch.  They use quality steak, and it seems like they grill it on an open flame instead of just a flat grill (Just based on taste, didn't actually see them do it).

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great giant burrito for only around $4.50."}
{"text":"Nice little place! Clean and air conditioned. The food is good but not the best. ( I use Guero Canelo and BK's Steakhouse from Tucson, AZ as a standard to compare Sonoran food in the U.S.) The best I've found in the area until now."}
{"text":"We've had hit and miss luck with Moreno's. My husband eats meat (loves meat) and I'm vegan. Our first time here was good - I told the waitress that I don't want any meat or dairy in the veggie burrito and she was very helpful. I ended up with a burrito that had pinto beans, pico, veggies that they cooked in oil instead of the usual butter, and sliced avocado instead of guacamole because their guacamole has cheese in it. Wow was she great. I was very impressed. I was meaning to review them as my husband had a great meal as well, but hadn't gotten around to it yet. The we went again and I'm super bummed. 

This time it was AWFUL. They made my burrito 3 times before bringing it out because \"the girl who is making it doesn't listen and she keeps putting cheese in it.\" Then they asked me to cut it open and it was FULL of sour cream. They brought it back to her, and they made it again. My husband was mostly done eating by the time I got food. When she brought it out, I cut it open and it had vegetables in it. JUST vegetables. No beans, no pico, no avocado - it was like they took a bag of mixed frozen veggies with broccoli, carrot, and random others and partially cooked it (some were raw) and then wrapped them in a tortilla. Ya. It was AWFUL. I ate the pinto beans  they brought on the side but only pecked at the unseasoned, partially cooked veggies in a sad tortilla until we left. Maybe if the cook \"doesn't listen\" she shouldn't be the cook anymore. Not coming here again because I literally don't know if I'll actually get to eat."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food lots of variety. From street tacos to seafood. My favorite is a green chile burro enchilada style with1/2  red and 1/2 green sauce over it. A variety of salsa the green is our favorite kinda sweet then spicy. They are 
Open for breakfast on the weekends and that is good in itself. Go out and try it this is our 4th time there  and no disappointments here. Oh! If you want to be adventurous try the Sonoran  dog it sound weird but is actually really good."}
{"text":"Went to this place because trying to get dinner on a Friday night in Gilbert can be pretty difficult. After trying to go to Arriba and YC's, where the lines were out the door, we (2 adults and 2 kids), were becoming more and more hangry. I looked up Mexican places on yelp and this one appeared very close to where we were. It is a little sit-down place in a strip mall location, which is interesting. It was full but we got a table after a couple mins of waiting. If you text MORENOS to a number they have on display, you get a free soda, which is alright. I like free. The staff was nice, no issues there. The menu has a lot of variety. My husband chose the chicken and mango quesadilla, (not sure if that was the name), and I got the fiesta burro. Children got bean and cheese burrito, (adult version), and the other child got the popcorn shrimp with rice and fries. I have to say the kids meal was a good size- my 10 year old boy was full and couldn't finish it all. The quesadilla and burrito were ok, the issue I had with the food was that it was so so bland. The quality and taste was good, everyone liked their food. Someone who doesn't like spicy would love this, but I love spicy and there really was no heat at all- not even in the salsa they brought out with the chips. So I knocked off two stars for blandness."}
{"text":"Service was slow and food came out cold because of which. Will not be going back here for awhile. Was hoping similar reviews were wrong but nope they were spot on!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and a friendly staff. It's a small place with a private parking lot. They even serve hot dogs Mexican style. The Flan is so delicious I wanted to stuff myself with more and more. It's thick but not dry. There's a salsa bar too."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos and beans are good!   Rice is fluffy and fresh     We haven't found much better yet in Mesa we just moved here but will try others."}
{"text":"Totally different than one in downtown chandler.  Menu is a little different and the food is more expensive, but still tastes great.  Staff was friendly and place was clean.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Had one of their Sonoran hot dogs last weekend.  OMG!  It was fantastic!  The ingredients don't seem like they should go well together, but was awesome!  Good thing this place isn't closer to my house."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the laziest, not customer oriented and slowest Moreno's I've ever been to. Went there with my family, 4 of us, got seated right away and was served chips and salsa, ordered our food, had to wait 45 minutes for our food, which they didn't not make it correctly. My brother is deathly allergic to onions, and asked the server to make sure no onion touched his food, they brought a hotdog with everything including onion. It was 2 in the afternoon and saw lots of servers but were all standing around talking. Never had a problem with other locations, but this one was just bad. Take your time and drive to the one on downtown Mesa. Had high hopes for this location, hope they better their service."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday with friends for lunch. The restaurant was set up like a family dining restaurant with booths and tables and a glass store front. The place was modestly decorated still lending to a Mexican ambiance.
The service was good. The drinks and food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a smothered burrito. It was a generous helping of shredded beef, peppers, onions, and cheese wrapped up in a large flour tortilla and smothered with green sauce. It was good but not great. I did eat the entire thing. Next time I want to try something different though."}
{"text":"Really great food and nice place to stop at after some late night shenanigans. I'm usually in the area later at night and there's no wait and food comes out nice and hot. Really love the Sonoran hotdogs and the street tacos. I also have their horchata a try and was pleasantly surprised at how good It was. Great joint to try when in the area."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my family and it seemed pretty busy but the staff was friendly and helped us at the counter pretty quickly. I had the ck mango tacos with a spinach enchilada. Really good food and great service at a fast pace. I left pretty satisfied. Can't wait to go back for another taco!"}
{"text":"At a sit-down restaurant, service is a crucial part of the experience. Although my food was brought out piping hot and tasted great, the service and drinks were poor and are the reasons for a lower rating. 

Our waitress told us she was 17 years old, and it couldn't have been more obvious. My friend, fellow Yelper Dee S., and I ordered margaritas...$2 off margaritas during Happy Hour. Our young server bashfully advised us that someone else would deliver them to our table, since she was not allowed to handle booze. The margaritas contained barely any tequila. Total letdown. We also asked our server for waters, and she continually forgot to bring them.

I ordered the spinach enchiladas. The only place on the menu this item is listed is under Gecko's Favorites, showing the two enchiladas are rounded out with southwestern corn and rice. I was brought out a plate that contained a single enchilada. Umm. I called our waitress over, and she was confused. I was forced to look at the menu with her to point out what I ordered. The lonely enchilada was comped, and I was then served what I truly ordered and charged for the dish accordingly. There were misunderstandings with Dee's not-so-complicated order as well. 

Our waitress took forever to bring containers for our leftovers. She seemed overwhelmed. 

In time, I am hoping this place can iron out the wrinkles."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Clean cozy and delicious. Our group tried tacos burritos and quesadilla - pork chicken & Carne Asada. The best! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We sat on the patio and weren't acknowledged until 4 other tables that came after us were. The service lacked. The salsa tasted odd so we asked for a different one, still no better. The beans were good, the fish tacos not so much. The sangria was a good portion for the price. Uncertain if we will rerun to try anything else."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The tamales could use a little more flavor but the mini-chimichangas with the jalapeno cream cheese were great. Love the horchata so refreshing. Nice clean little restaurant tucked away. Also look for their hotdog cart, those are fun as well. The prices are great. A fun environment with great staff who are polite and very on top of keeping the restaurant clean. Something to be appreciated"}
{"text":"Awesome grilled pork tacos, the beef ones are good to, but they can be on the fatty side most times. chicken delicious as well, but to me it doesn't top the pork. great salsa bar at every moreno's and awesome service. food always is hot and come out quickly. i love the horchata as well. i come here for a quick pit stop taco craving all the time!"}
{"text":"Not the first time I've said it but I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food. My husband on the other hand, could eat it everyday. Because I was lazy to cook we decided to go get Mexican food and what do you know, Moreno's is fairly close to home. We walked in and the place was busy. Very clean and the service was great. Our server brought us chips with a bean dip, red and green salsa. The bean dip was awesome! I ordered the beef chimichanga, my husband the enchiladas, one of my girls chicken fingers and the other nachos. While our food was good I wish my chimichanga wasn't so filled with shredded beef. I know most people would love it but that's my preference. The main reason for a not perfect rating was because they did not offer nachos for kids and we had to order an appetizer with the beans on the side (my daughter won't eat it). I thought it was too expensive for her munching on a few chips and very wasteful as we threw most of it out. I'll probably try something else on the menu next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place after noticing that the brick & mortar restaurant had opened (there was previously a food truck in the parking lot).  The place was pretty busy for a Sunday evening.  We were seated quickly & placed our orders. While waiting for our food to arrive I started reading the reviews of this place & got worried.  I looked around,  no trash or crickets on the floor (yay).  There are indeed a lot of staff and they seem to be in a learning curve but there is one fellow who seems to be training them.  He checked on the orders and regularly checked on us through our visit.   The chips were crispy and did not taste like they came from a bag.  The bean dip & salsa were good but I didn't really care for the green salsa. My husband had pollo fundido, substituting carne asada for the chicken.  The staff had no problem with the substitution, which is rare these days.  He said it was delicious.  I had aroz con pollo. It didn't look very special when it arrived but the flavor was amazing!!!  The beans were cooked pinto beans and they were very good.  If you're not Mexican you many not know that cooked pinto beans become refried beans the next day.  So the person who said they use canned beans is probably wrong.  Portion size is normal, not huge like most places these days.  I consider that a big plus.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Our first time was a very busy Friday night. The service was pretty good too. I look forward to coming again, and also having another good take-out go-to in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"so glad they put one so close to my house. love the food and great service. try everything on the menu. definitely coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Worse food and service ever. If you like bland mexican food with zero spice, this is the place for you! The margaritas are straight sweet and sour which makes me question the rest of the cocktails. Do yourself a favor and go to Tia Rosa's or Nandos!"}
{"text":"We picked up some food to go on New Year's Eve. I had the Moreno burrito (or whatever their house special burrito is?), my hubby had the delicious burrito that comes covered in their cheesy spinach sauce, and then we also ordered some tamales to eat at another time. The tamales (chicken and beef) were delicious. The cheesy spinach covered burrito with green chile meat was delicious. My Moreno's / \"mixta\" burrito was ok, I was not a fan of the rice and beans inside of the burrito rather than as sides. The red salsa is good, the green salsa is a little too sweet, as other reviewers have mentioned.

What surprised us was the restaurant itself. It is quaint, clean and well decorated. The staff working were friendly. We will definitely go back to dine in and try more of their menu. It also looked like they had good weeknight happy hour drink and appetizer specials."}
{"text":"First time here and must say everything my family and I ordered was fresh and tasted great! We especially love their vampiros! Do yourself a favor and try this place if you want excellent Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was anticipating the opening of this location for several weeks. Two weeks ago I noticed it was open and stopped for lunch. The place seemed to be over staffed, with servers, greeters and bus people tripping over one another. I guess it was because they were newly opened and wanted to ensure the hoard of customers could be handled. The hoard had failed to show up yet when I was there. My waiter, Derrick, was personable and watchful (checked in to see if I was satisfied several times). He knew the menu. I ordered the fish taco meal. Loved the bean dip, although I'm pretty sure it isn't freshly made...it's bean dip, so I dug in. The fish tacos were extremely soggy (to the point that the tortillas disintegrated) and had a really odd sweetish taste like cinnamon had been sprinkled on instead of chili. The beans and rice were fresh from the can, bland and unremarkable.

Being a forgiving person, I tried them again today. The service was good again. The bean dip made me happy, and I ordered crispy shredded beef tacos. UGH! The taco shells were thick, tough and greasy. The meat was chewy and everything was bland, bland, bland. 

If I want \"gringa\" Mexican food, I'll go to Taco Bell. Unfortunately, unlike baseball, this place is two strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"After an intense Sonoran hot dog craving, I decided to hop onto Yelp and came across this little gem of a place.  I rallied up my friend and we set out on an adventure for an early-dinner Mexican food quest!

My friend had actually been here before.  He use to work in the area so he knows all the great spots on Arizona Ave.  With the great Yelp reviews and my friend's word, I was really pumped up!  I got myself a horchata, a Sonoran dog, and a Moreno's burrito [AKA a \"wet burrito,\" with carne asada filling and enchilada sauce poured on top].  He had an agua de jamaica, a Sonoran dog, and a carne asada torta.  After polishing off a delicious Sonoran dog, I couldn't even look at my burrito!  I took a few bites of the fluffy rice, the smooth beans, and the flavorful yet kinda tough burrito and I was full.  I think I should have took the advice of another Yelper and ordered two Sonorans and called it a night.  That food coma is hitting hard!  My friend said the bread on his torta was a bit dry but he still took his food home so I think that's a good indicator.  Also, don't forget to stop off at their small little salsa bar.  Their green guacamole sauce is great!

Anyways, there are limited parking and limited indoor seating so I can see how the place can become packed fast!  Service is superb and it's always nice to see such friendly and welcoming wait staff --- she really sold those hot dogs!  Portions are also huge and I really could have just split a torta with my buddy.  Anyways, upon reflection and a few more bites of my now cold burrito, I think I found a new favorite place in the east valley for Mexican.  I will definitely be back for the Sonoran dog and their horchata.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my second time I've ordered from Moreno's, this time I put in my order and put in that I wanted Hot Sauce in any where it would allow me.  I ordered 3 items, when it was delivered it had no salsa or hot sauce.  When I called them they said that they had no way to bring it to me unless I made another order.  They said next time I could have a free salsa and chips when I come in.  I've never been there or plan to go there.  That's why I ordered it! They still haven't fixed it."}
{"text":"Interesting. Not outstanding. Their soft tacos were plain, but the sonoran hotdog- their signature item was AWESOME!.  Great staff too."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Just had the Moreno burrito with chicken and green chili, and would definitely recommend. Huge children's plates.... and they bring out chips with green salsa, red salsa, and bean dip for starters. All fantastic. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of the decor and ambiance. Clean and neat, but nothing super special"}
{"text":"My family and I go here a lot.  Generally we do takeout.    The food is fantastic and all of it is so delicious.   
My favorite is tacos and theirs' are outstanding because they are not greasy and are big and delicious.  
I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Their street tacos are great. You can also get a good deal on taco Tuesday. Every flavor of salsa at their salsa bar is good in their own unique way. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I gotta say this place was a complete let down... I went Saturday which was the 2nd day open for dinner with a family member, expecting to have some delicious Mexican food from all the reviews from the other locations. I was wrong. We walked into what looked like just a plain room that was missing something. My personal opinion it was missing a opening to see into the grill and smell all the delicious foods being cooked. We sat down and ordered our waters and I got a carne asada street taco to start just to try. The waitress seemed very young and didn't seem to know anything about the foods or how to be a waitress (this to me was a big fail on the restaurants part to throw her to the sharks before training her). I felt bad since asking her questions about the food she had to go back into the kitchen 4 times to ask and verify the answers. While deciding what to get I ate half of the taco and it was plain jane mediocre... Tortillas store bought and the meat was very chewy... We munched on the chips and salsa, the beans(they made it clear first beans dip which is tiny is free, refills are .99 each) were pretty good but I love HOT HOT salsa, so when the waitress came back I asked if they had HOT HOT salsa in the back? She said yes and brought some out... It was so disappointing.. It had no flavor.... Watered down... and less spicy then the originals they brought out.. We ordered our food and I got once again carne asada in my chimichanga because our waitress told me the shredded beef has vegetables mixed in (which I hate), and I hate pork, I also think its a sin to put chicken in a chimichanga. The waitress forgot my beans that I had requested, which I just let go and didn't say anything about it....the chimichanga itself was a little better, but seriously anything deep fried is pretty damn good. I asked the waitress for something I didn't think I would have to ask for... yep, tabasco or Cholula. I was surprised when she said \"whats Cholula\"??? After explaining to her what Cholula was she told me have that either... It sucked pretty hard that I was so stoked for this place to open and its a no go in my book. The lack of training really hurt the waitress and the restaurant. Im sticking to my beliefs that the restaurant failed her so I still tipped her pretty well. Hopefully its because the location is so new... Im not willing to spend another dollar to find out."}
{"text":"My first time here.  Very clean place.  Service was very good and prompt.  Was disappointed in there salsa.  Flavor on their extra hot salsa was not desirable.  Did absolutely love the seafood chimi.  Other guest didn't like salsa either but loved food."}
{"text":"It's official: Moreno's is my favorite Mexican food place in the valley. The Tejano burro isn't just good, it's now one of my favorite meals! Every dish we've ever ordered has been excellent. If anyone ever asks for a Mexican food recommendation, this is where I send them. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Got take out. Chili relleno, beans and rice and a  Sonoran dog.
Dog was okay, nothing special. Actually, everything was okay, but not special.
Service was very nice, friendly.
No surprise here, but about 20 percent more expensive than comparable .
Extensive menu, I need to try some other items."}
{"text":"Morenos is a great Mexican place that has some really good Sonoran dogs!! One of my favorite foods. I come here often for lunch and my co workers and I always get food here. 

It's reasonably priced and I never stay hungry. The tacos are small though. But the dogs and the burritos are good. I would take Mexican friends to this place."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican. Kinda like fast food-place your order at the counter but they then bring it to you when done. 4 different salsas on the condiment bar ranging from very mild to quite spicy. I had the two crispy tacos with beef. Not much flavor in the meat but was a good taco. Meal came with rice & beans which are always good! My sister had the two tamales which were the best I had ever tasted! A very nice variety of choices."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could possibly give this place four stars.  Yes, the hot dogs are definitely four star worthy.  But the rest of the food only earns one star.  So, I guess that averages out to about two and a half.  I'll go ahead and round down due to the dirty tables and sketchy parking lot.  And can someone explain to me how they can afford five flat screen TVs just to display the menu but they still serve their food on styrofoam plates with plastic forks?  I don't get it."}
{"text":"Food was good. $23 for two Chimi's with two sodas. Kind of spendy since the place across the street has a Chimi for $5. They play Mexican Rock music. Thought I seen a rooster dancing here lol."}
{"text":"Have this place a try finally. Was not blown away by what we ordered. My son got the kids chimi they were literally like empty egg rolls, fries were good. I got a enchilada w/ \"carne asada\" more like a thin piece of unflavored maybe meat. Definitely not Carne Asada. My husband got the chimichanga and it was actually pretty good. And we all know how important good salsa and chips are at a Mexican restaurant... was let down. If we go back will definitely not get the same things."}
{"text":"Horrible waiter never coming back 


been here once before was great especially service this time horrible will not be back.
We walked in and headed to outside sat down and right away received chips and salsa awesome 
Bad part we sat after that for 20 minuets no service no drinks. The waiter came out twice to talk to the other couple looked at us each time still nothing I'm going to assume that there was only one waiter for outside since there was only us and another couple with kids . We will never be back to waste time waiting again."}
{"text":"Well was so happy to find Marino's just down the street from our hotel. The menu looks great with all the usual Mexican things. I ordered a burrito and a couple of tacos to test things out to look at their asada Al Pastore & Chicken. Everything was incredible wonderful I liked it and I eat a lot of Mexican food. This would be a go-to place if I was a local here for sure. Their spicy carrots or nice and the green salsa added a nice little touch to the tacos. The next thing that was incredible was the speed with which they make the food. These guys are ready and they know how to knock out a meal and almost nothing flat. I'll bet this place is a machine lunch. I'll save that for another day"}
{"text":"First time I had Sonoran hot dog was during my first visit to Tucson.  Ever since then,  I have been wanting to try it again. My friend Jose grew up in Arizona his whole life and recommended me this place to try out.  

It isn't a big restaurant.  It has approximately 6 booths with 3 tables in the middle of the walkways.  If you come here with a huge party,  just be aware of this.  As soon as I walked in,  I saw a lady holding a huge glass on her hand with a spoon.  Holy moly it's cocktail shrimp!  I have to have that too.  We ordered a Sonoran hot dog,  cocktail shrimps as well as Carne Asada taco.  After being spoiled with the authentic sonoran hot dog,  I have to admit that it was no comparison (although it was still good). As for the cocktail shrimp,  you have a choice of ordering it with chips or crackers.  The portion is generous and delicious.  I kept picking out the shrimp until.... well,  I noticed that they did not devein them (yike yike yike).  I saw a huge black vein running through all of them. Also, $12.99 was a bit too pricy in my opinion. Neverthess, I am glad that I tried it. 

Overall,  my experience here was good.  I will not order the cocktail shrimp again but I do want to try other items on the menu.

P.S.  I'm not sure why the restaurant puts the Sonoran hot dog stand outside when it was over 110 yesterday. I honestly feel bad for the guy who was standing there all by himself."}
{"text":"I must say that Murano's Mexican restaurant grill was probably one of the best places to eat for a small joint but all it's become now is people with attitudes of the front dirty service I wish I could say something positive I stuck around his company for over 10 years and it is absolutely become the worst the worst when I'm comparing it to saying Taco Bell I'd rather eat at when we treat it with a smile then get sick I ordered a shrimp cocktail and it just tasted like shrimp water is just horrible I'm so sorry Murano I wish you guys really got it together"}
