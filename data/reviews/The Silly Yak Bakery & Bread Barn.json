{"text":"I highly recommend this place, not only because their items are so delicious, but because you can also order online.  My favorite item so far is the lemon blueberry scone.  It was really moist, full of flavor and not dry and tasteless like other GF items tend to be.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I spotted this bread at the farmers market on Saturday in Madison. I really wanted to love this bread- it looked amazing! I purchased the Blueberry Vanilla bread and the Gluten free Tomato Parmesan Spinach but ended up pretty disappointed because both were extremely flavorless.  That paired with the fact that were $4.50 and $7.50, I was not really happy with the purchase. I would have only given this 2 stars based on the items I tried, but it sounds like I just picked the wrong thing. Based on all the stellar reviews, I would try something else in the future."}
{"text":"A friend and I bought a sampling of Silly Yak's egg-free, casein-free, and gluten-free baked goods. I had high hopes but ultimately everything we bought was dry, dense, and lacking in flavor. I rarely find anything truly inedible but this time I did throw my share away. A major disappointment after the other positive reviews."}
{"text":"Gluten-free baked goods galore, as well as GF pastas, cereals, snack bars, beers, as well as some conventional baked goods that contain gluten.  Their website lists bake days and allows shipping.  If you're there on a day they're baking conventional goods, you can get frozen GF items.  I greatly enjoyed the GF blueberry muffin I had this morning and hear the chocolate cherry scones are not to be missed."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful when we saw the \"gluten-free\" sign, but once again, it's mostly a mainstream bakery with gluten-free offerings. They ARE made in a separate dedicated kitchen though, so that part is reassuring and I do hope they'll switch over. Their gluten free and dairy free and vegan offerings are very small, and only frozen. I really wish they would focus on JUST gluten free and expand their dairy free line as well. It is so frustrating when a bakery calls itself a gluten free bakery still sells gluten products that are displayed right front and center. It's like a slap in the face to those of us who cannot eat it. What we did try was dry, crumbly and they overcompensated with sugar."}
{"text":"SO cute! Super friendly workers. Great selection. Imagine those little kid bakeries at schools x10 with so many great things and a great selection. You know its made right there. Great prices. Love Love Love."}
{"text":"I don't have gluten intolerance or any dietary concerns, I just love the baked goods and breads here. Muffins, cookies and breads are all amazing and reasonably priced. The staff is super sweet. Just wish they were open on Sundays too so I could get my Silly Yak fix!  :) The staff is super sweet and nice. 

Update: I also wish you sold coffee products - this area of Mineral Point Road is a desert for good coffee unless you want to go to the gas station or a chain place like the Starbucks in Target or Panera."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I felt super welcome when we first entered the bakery as the employee that was helping us explained the set up (essentially two bakeries under one roof) and asked if we had any food allergies that would necessitate gluten-free breads. I don't personally like GF bread, and he showed us all of the offerings of the Bread Barn (non-GF bakery). We ended up purchasing jalapeno poppers (six for $4 or so) and a small loaf of their Granny's White bread ($4).

We devoured all of the poppers that night and have about two slices of the white bread left. All of it was super, super good, and my girlfriend and I have definitely tried our fair share of breads/bakeries. We'll definitely be back to try the Italian pull-apart bread!"}
{"text":"The selection of gluten free products is amazing! You can see the bakers making the bread if you get to the store early enough. I hadn't had a donut since I went gluten free and I bought one my first visit and fell in love. Also, try the garlic cheddar gluten free bread. It's deeeeelicious."}
{"text":"Silly Yak sells egg-free, casein-free, and gluten-free (marked GFCFEF) baked delights! If you adhere to these dietary restrictions, Silly Yak is the perfect place to find breads, muffins, and cookies. I am mostly pleased with them because of their selection of \"contains gluten\" goods. YESS YUM I will eat my \"contains gluten\" lemon blueberry scone while you munch away on your GFCFEF coffee chocolate muffin, both equally delicious. 

Everything in the store is clearly marked, so whether you're looking for gluten-free & egg-free or only gluten-free goods, you can easily find the right type. They also have a useful calendar of their bake dates, and apparently have shipping available if you're interested in that.  

My sister mentioned that the xanthan gum (used as an egg equivalent in the egg-free products) made her mint chocolate chip muffin extra chewy, but didn't compromise the taste. 

pros: clearly marked goods, something for everyone!, odd assortment of other gluten-free foods (beer and pizzas!)"}
{"text":"I just recently went gluten free and had heard about this place and couldn't wait to go. I was pretty disappointed. They have a regular bakery there, which I didn't know, and its such a teaser. The gluten free section is quite small...I ended up with some casein free, gluten free, egg free things because of the limited selection. They were not very good. I prefer udis white bread over this. The pizza was ok....maybe it was the rounds I picked that I didn't like (spinach & mushroom). I will go back on 'gluten free bakery day'...when they have samples...maybe I'll find something I like and try a different pizza. They have a schedule of when they cook certain things."}
{"text":"The bread here is amazing. 

I guess they close the place down, clean out the ovens hardcore and bake all the gluten free goods once or twice a week.  Some stuff is sold fresh and other stuff is frozen and sold  all week. 

Besides bread, they offer fresh pasta, cookies/muffins, croutons, and pizza crust.

Their cakes look pretty terrible though, they bake em in a square tin pan and frost em like my kid brother frosts his brownies... they should get a cake decorator!"}
{"text":"They bake delicious muffins and donuts for all the sensitivities - gluten/dairy/egg/soy-free.  So grateful for this place.  Very easy to grab and go."}
{"text":"I've been driving to madison to get goodies from Silly Yak since I was diagnosed with Celiacs. Even with GF bakery items becoming easier to find and make, you can't beat Silly Yak's treats! Last thanksgiving, they made it easy for me to make my family's traditional stuffing and my in-laws favorite treats both GF and delicious! We get our birthday cakes and pies there for special occasions, and always get something new to try each time we are there. The scones are probably my favorite sweet treat, and their specialty breads make the best sandwiches! Looking forward to farmers market season when I can grab some goodies while walking around the Capitol. YUM!"}
{"text":"The Bavarian Rye.  If you have not tried it you should.  It is the best bread I have ever eaten.  For many years I assumed that silly yak/bread barn was exclusively gluten free and never stopped in.  What a mistake.  They have the best moist freshest tasting bread.  I am sure it is because they grind the grain right at the bakery.

Fabulous bread, oh and snickerdoodle cookies. As long as you're there you should try the snickerdoodle cookie, and the molasses cookies, oh and the jalapeño popper rolls, and well pretty much everything else."}
{"text":"I love dealing with Kyle and his team of bakers!! I use their products in my restaurant and the customers are loving it!! This product allows those with celiacs to enjoy sandwiches and everything else are so excited that we carry such an array of gluten free products. One customer has not had a cinnamon roll in a couple yrs and now she knows where to go to enjoy it with coffee!!  Also since they ship is another great thing, I'm in Kenosha and of course their in Madison."}
{"text":"My dreams have not been filled with sugar plums, but with gluten free jalapeño cheesy bread since visiting Silly Yak. Say \"silly yak\" a few times out loud, and you'll understand the name.

I went on a bit of spree at this place from doughnuts to cheesy bread to cookies. Yes, I'll be working out more than usual after eating all of these carbs. 

Everything reminded me of the taste of \"real\" doughnuts, cheesy bread and cookies. If you have celiac, this bakery is the place for you. They bake in a GF kitchen, and you may even be able to watch them bake through the glass.

You can bet they will be shipping more cheesy bread to me in Florida!"}
{"text":"We love this bread.   I tell all my friends about it.  It is the only bread we eat.  Careful though, you need to refrigerate after a few days if you don't eat it all up right away.  They make half loaves for smaller appetites.  Delicious.  Our favorite is the Dakota and the Grandma's white is second."}
{"text":"This is one of the two best places for gluten-free products that I've been to in the entire country (the other being Andrea's in St. Louis, though they have since closed their retail outlet and now sell only through grocery stores). Aside from the clever name, Silly Yak has delicious food. The jalapeno-cheddar bread is wonderful, as are the cinnamon rolls and pumpkin muffins and the regular bread and ... well pretty much everything is delicious. Two extra bonuses: they have a stall at the farmer's market, and they sell beer. According to one of the employees, they are the only bakery in Wisconsin with a liquor license. They should frame that and put it on the store window. All in all, a terrific place."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been to a lot of gluten free bakeries  since I have Celiac's and I really, really want to like this one because the selection is amazing. I mean, pasta, a million types of bread and pastries... but, I just can't like this one.

I've had several different varieties of things, egg-free, casein free, just the gluten free stuff, but they all lacked moisture. And that's the thing I find in this bakery, is that the items all consistently lack moisture. And yes that's hard to do with GF baking but it can be done.  I haven't found a product I truly enjoy, everything sort of tastes like a chalky, crumbly version of a Pillsbury product. The bread is also dense (I've had gluten-free bread that isn't) and costs way too much - its almost cheaper to buy the frozen GF bread from the grocery store.

The other thing that worries me is there is a regular bakery next door, and while I assume that they do not share a ventilation system I do worry about contamination. (Flour can stay suspended in the air for 3 - 10 days) and if you are sensitive to gluten that can be worrisome.

The staff is friendly though, and the place is warm and cozy - I just wish the food tasted like it."}
{"text":"Wow! I just got an assortment of breakfast treats for my department this morning and everything is awesome: chocolate chip and coffee scones, cinnamon rolls (dense and doughy yummers!), muffins (raspberry, apple cinnamon, and cornbread honey), and pecan rolls. I hit an all time sugar high because I couldn't stop putting stuff in my mouth. I'm going to have to walk another 10 miles today to burn off it all."}
{"text":"WOW, the bread is the BEST I have EVER had. 

I tried their cinnamon and it was soft, yummy and very good.

My favorite bread in the world is their Cranberry Orange bread, WOWWWWW, it's the best in the world. 

I LOVE this place"}
{"text":"This bakery is the best gluten-free bakery I have ever been to. Lots of variety for products (pasta, breads, cookies, pizza crust, etc.). The staff is friendly and the bread tastes much better than national brands bought in the grocery store. Very satisfied on the first visit and can't wait to try more varieties!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free heaven!!

Finally got to stop in here before flying back to Denver. SO GLAD. They apparently ship nationwide, so I will be making an order very soon. I haven't had a scone since going GF...the blueberry one was the best scone (with or without gluten!) I have ever had. Chocolate doughnut...yes. Nailed it.  The  dried fruit granola is delicious to the point my somewhat picky toddler will gobble it. I have bread and a couple other treats left to try, and I can't wait.  Will be my first stop next time I am in Madison.  YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"First, the gluten free bakery was divine! I am from out of town so my visit here was a first. I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the variety that was offered. Seeing as though my visit was early in the morning I had anticipated a cup of coffee and a small table to sit and do some studying while I enjoyed my breakfast. Unfortunately, I didn't find any coffee or tables (maybe they had some, but I didn't see any) but even if they did I probably would not have stayed anyway because the atmosphere is not really one that invites company to stay and eat. It seems more like the kind of place to come in, buy bakery and go. With that said, I already cannot wait to go back and buy some of the gluten-free pumpkin bread and snickerdoodles and ginger spice cookies! Typical of gluten free goods it was a little pricey but totally worth the cost."}
{"text":"If you are at ALL a fan of breakfast sandwiches, you have GOT to try the \"jalapeño poppers\" (small rolls) made here - just cook up an egg, heat the roll, and serve as sandwich.  OMG.  HEAVEN!  

I've been a connoisseur of breakfast sandwiches for years now and I can truly say that nothing beats these little rolls at home with an egg.  The rolls are very soft and fairly small - perfect size for an egg sandwich.  Most importantly, they're baked chalk full of cheddar, bits of jalapeño, and cream cheese.  They're amazing plain or even with hummus, but as for me I'll be having them EVERY morning I'm back in Madison, with an egg.  And orange juice.  And coffee.

I discovered these last fall at the farmer's market downtown Madison and they've been my best Farmer's Market find - ever.  I'm utterly in love and I'm sure these rolls will soon have a cult following, if they don't already.  

Bonus:  Great customer service.  Very friendly workers.
Double Bonus:  Their danishes are PERFECTO.  Flaky but still super moist and stretchy - you MUST try if you like danishes!!"}
{"text":"If you are thinking about ordering from this bakery and having it sent to your location, I would factor in Customer Service.  Or lack thereof. I recently ordered 4 items and was charged a s&h charge that was nearly the price of the 4 items.  Although they were shipped USPriority, they arrived crushed and crumbled.  I have called several times only to be \"dismissed\" and told that Kyle would call me back. He hasn't.  I have written 4 emails that are rejected by their server.  Perhaps I am incorrect  in thinking that since they shipped the product and that priority US mail is insured, that the sender would initiate the contact to rectify the problem.  It would seem to me that someone at Silly Yak could, indeed, help me out with this."}
{"text":"Thank you to everyone at the Silly Yak Bakery!  The gluten-free casein-free donuts are to die for!"}
{"text":"Found them at the farmers market. I loved all the gluten free choices! I tried a cinnamon role, scone, and cookie. They were honestly just ok. But still convenient to have them there and have options."}
{"text":"My kiddo is recently gluten free.  Although our main cooking at home isn't an issue the dreaded birthday treats every classmate needs to bring in to celebrate is a nightmare for parents of kids with food allergies.  I loved the selection here, there were a lot of yummy looking desserts and breads.  I bought a couple frozen sprinkled donuts to throw in her lunch box on a treat day and I kind of wanted to eat it myself.  There are some glutened treats as well, the M and M cookies had to be purchased and they were absolutely worth the $2 I spent on the few.  I love how meticulous labeling was and how the employee double checked to make sure I knew the cookies had gluten.  I'm more than happy to stop here again for some fun treats to keep on hand-they store in the freezer for approximately a month until they may get freezer burned.  I myself, wish she liked bread more as I'd happily share a loaf or two of them.  The prices are affordable and the quality is wonderful-definitely stop by!"}
