{"text":"Hands down the best hole in the wall Mexican comfort food with a drive thru to boot! Plus they're open 24 hours! Whenever I crave Mexican food, this place never fails to satisfy! The generous servings and reasonable prices keep me coming. I love it!"}
{"text":"I love the enchiladas verdes and Tortas here the rice is cooked perfect the fresh water they make is not so good but food delicious new favorite spot"}
{"text":"Try their giant tortas with the veneno sauce I love hot food and this sauce is awesome. The food tastes delicious after a night out in the town"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! I'd rate, the best in Vegas so far. Not a fancy place, if that's what ur looking for, but NEVER disappoints! AND, they're open 24hours. We've gone on several occasions & have had different cooks, they've all been great! Everything is cooked to order. Unlike some places that pre cook the meat & keep in warmers/heaters which tend to dry up meat. Shrimp is large sized. Portions are generous & everything is tasty & well seasoned. We've had to wait 15+ minutes or so on some occasions bc our order was large & custom made but it was worth it. Just a good tip incase ur in a hurry & expect to order, eat & bail. We always go through the convenient drive thru & have no problem waiting on GOOD FOOD!"}
{"text":"A very unexpected find off the Strip.  Basically, a friend of mine was visiting with his girlfriend and was tired of paying the food prices on the Strip.  I've passed this place before and have wanted to stop in and this was the reason I was looking for to stop in since this place doesn't have the most inviting feel to it from the outside but has a nice mom & pop feel to it on the inside.  After that first encounter, I have been going here on a regular basis and got my roommates to fall in love with this place.  The food and prices are excellent and this place has a 24 hour drive through.  The only downside is that some of the employees (especially late at night) don't speak English very well so I have become a master at ordering my burrito in Spanish to avoid any issues."}
{"text":"Just devoured my breakfast torta- scrambled eggs, retried beans, cheese, and guacamole. It was served on fresh bread. Yum! This fast food restaurant has typical mexican meat options: chorizo, milanesa, carne asada, etc., (not sure about veggie or dairy free ) Las Famosas De Jose are reasonably priced and very filling. My 7 and 12 year old also enjoyed the food and the fresh orchata, pineapple,  watermelon and cantaloup drinks.  We will definitely return. Don't let the open 24 hour sign deter you. It was clean."}
{"text":"The service was good however none of the food had any flavor. I would not return the pozole is so bland you had to eat the bland carrots in order to get less bland flavor. Their carrots taste like water. The rice is a little crunchy. The only thing that has flavor the actual vegetables are the radishes and the diet soda.The price is not bad however you would want some flavor with your food.all yeah and they give you medicine instead of having the pozole."}
{"text":"I know famous. Jose on twain from. the. sister location on trop & topaz. they are known for overstuffed and oversized. tortas (Mexican sandwich )6in. to maybe a foot long. Jose knows that. size matters 18to24 in. torta. is on the small side. With the sauces or salsas u rarely see north of. the border... wide choice. of addons, to your very own Mexican sandwich comfort food."}
{"text":"The tacos were so bomb! The salsas were really good & spicy! Went one night, I had to go back the next morning before going back to cali. & the staff was friendly & the place was nice & clean."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! Im probably gonna barf in a second here. Just got back, I was hungry for something quick and i decided to go to taco bell bc it had a drive thru. but taco bell was poppin on this sunday night and so I came to this filth hole because not a fly was there. I figured it would be good like robertos or something. So they had these specialty tortas, but i am a picky eater so I asked them for a \"build ur own\". I had three ingredients in there. thats all. milanesa, beans, and ham. THATS ALL. first of all they made me repeat the order because the girl cook, seemed to not have understood that thats all I wanted. She asked me if I wanted this or that or that. I was like OMG I can read ur freakin item list just make my food. oh, and the girl taking my order kept trying to talk in english to me when I kept speaking spanish because I could not understand her english.  I am more comfortable talking english but if I can't understand your accent, you need to start speaking spanish to me instead of practicing your english on me. Ok finally, my total was 13.50! I thought, ok its gonna be one of those big tortas like on the picture and basically what they are known for I suppose. They made me park somewhere else and it took them 8 minutes for that torta...with 3 things in there. She comes to my car finally and the freakin torta is just as big as you would get at a robertos. and not to exaggerate but I am willing to bet robertos is just a tad bigger. I figure fine i just won't come to get ripped off again, I go home and eat. The bread is so thin that it all melted by the time I made it to my house across the street. so I had to eat the 3 things inside the torta just without bread. I realize why it dissolved, the meat was so freakin greasy like when they don't clean the grill for hours. they were not even busy omg, I am just disgusted. and if you've gone through their drive thru you know how filthy it looks, I can't imagine how it looks back doors. Anyway, I guess thats the price I pay for not wanting to get out of my car to order food at a decent restaurant, Instead I chose the drive thru. If you want want of their specialty torta, i guess your money will be worth it, but if you are going to deviate from their 4 choices, you will just get ripped off and get the tiny torta for the same price of $13. Yes, I am mad but its only because of the terrible service, the shameless filth, and of course they ripped me off. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice and the 2 times that i came here wasn't impressed the first time me and my wife came in around 12 something in the morning there was this guy working the register and the kitchen so i knew the waiting time was gonna be a factor to my order but didnt care so first of all he doesn't have a hat on his whole head and shoulders were full of dandruff that's disgusting didnt wear gloves and had like fucked up nails so we get our food mind you its was almost 30 dollars for an order of 2 sopes a drink and a lengua burrito with a drink my wife didnt like her sopes they were hard shells and couldnt even chew it my burrito was no flavor and wasnt even filling i dont understand why some restaurants have to have expensive ass food with low protions and no flavor the second i went by myself and this time there was 2 girls very greetful and nice so i ordered a torta cubana im expecting this sandwich to pack with all Types of different varieties of topping nope i was very disappointed and was also expensive and not filing i won't be going there anymore also very ghetto location who knows might happen around that area"}
{"text":"Great real Mexican food, salsas are fresh and delicious and they have real fruit drinks. Will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Most people that know me will tell you that I LOVE mexican food.  I am a San Diego native and have had my fair share of good cooking.  When I saw Las Famosas one day on my way to work, I knew I would have to stop by to see if this would be my new spot.  As I pulled up I noticed a drive-thru (wooh too!).  I ordered a carne asada burrito with cheese and the cost was close to $9.  WHATTTT?! That's reckless.  A good burrito should never cost that much.  When I finally had the opportunity to taste the burrito, I wasn't impressed. It was stuffed with rice and the carne asada was bland. I had to soak the burrito in salsa in order to taste any flavor.  I couldn't even get through the burrito before throwing it away.  Sorry, but I can't say that I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices!  I had a chicken burrito. The meat was was marinated in a piquant, flavorful sauce, and came with lots of fresh cilantro (they asked first).  The tortas looked great, and they are, indeed \"gigantes\".  The place can only seat 16 or so, and you order at the window. Definitely my new go-to place for a quick and tasty lunch on the East side of town.  BTW: the old name of the place  - Ay! Jose Takos - is still on the door, but the new name is Las Famosas de Jose.   Ask Jose - he'll tell ya why."}
{"text":"24 hr spot for your Mexican craving which isn't far from the strip. A tad pricey but it was good. Just a small clue anywhere you go to in that city of food would tell you something is good where you have All races to eat any establishment"}
{"text":"I rarely post bad reviews. But it's more on a customer service level. We are just wishing people would pay attention to what we want/order when we ask/pay. We ordered 12 tacos and one carne asada burrito and two agua Frescas via drive-thru which came to $40. Seems a bit much.   Asked for a side of guacamole, opened the bag wasn't in there. We were asked if we wanted red or green salsa, wanted green only. We got served EXTRA red.   Food/drink review: The pineapple agua Fresca was extremely full of pulp? I'm just not sure what's going on. Tacos are okay, pretty bland to be honest.  Burrito was fine.   Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, very authentic. Fun to try all the salsas. Atmosphere is dated and worn, but the reports of the bad neighborhood are over stated. Would have like real silverware. Meats are tender, rich complex tastes. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place so much i dont even care that its attached to an oil change garage. Their burritos are HUGE and awesome. Their breakfast burritos are especially amazing! I tried one of their giant tortas once and it was good, like a beeter version of a subway party sub. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Real deal authentic Mexican food with a drive thru and open 24/7? Ummm yes please. My favorite stop on the way home from work. They usually only take 5 or so minutes to prepare my food and are very nice and accomodating."}
{"text":"Not my spot .. I tried the paquita torta had to much stuff on it .. Wasn't bad but wasn't good..  I think is an ok place .. I don't know about the tacos but I wouldn't tried it again .."}
{"text":"Slow service, 24 HR drive thru, in a ghetto area, I ordered a burrito Carne Asada and got al pastor. I didn't want to debate with the staff there and just take the loss. Won't come here again"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican joint.  Located on dumpy (but not dangerous) Twain Ave., with a drive-thru window if you don't want to get out of your car.  Open 24 hours.    My burrito was meaty and flavorful -- I got the marinated pork -- and a good size.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here, and their burritos are AMAZINGLY delicious. They have some of the best salsas  which makes this taqueria one of my faves. Also, there are honest employees here. I once forgot my IPhone at the dining table and they saved it for me. Knowing that this place is in a shady part of town, I was truly thankful for their honestly.   Tip! If you like really spicy salsa, try their VENENO AZTECA!  My favorite: Burrito de Tripa"}
{"text":"Not my favorite taco place in town,  but it works if you're starving and headed home from the fun hog ranch lol. Inside was clean and the service was fast,  bit the food is mediocre at best.  I had the al pastor tacos and chips... both were extremely dry.  In my opinion,  pastor tacos should be moist and juicy.  The tortillas were nice,  but it could have used 2 because they fell apart on first grab.  The chips seemed home made,  but might have been baked? I can't put my finger on why they were so dry without being super crisp either..."}
{"text":"So much better than Roberto's, for real! Open 24hrs! And they have a drive thru! and the have aguas frescas! Pretty much any Mexican plate you can think of on the menu.  I like the tacos de cabeza, Birra's bomb.com, barbacoa, chile relleno, it's pretty much all good.  Asked the cook for grilled onions no problem.  Staff friendly and place seems clean, compared to Roberto's."}
{"text":"I feel like you have to be drunk to properly appreciate 3-pound burritos and $16 multi-meat and cheese tortas with silly names. I consider myself a fairly adventurous eater but chose to stick to their basic tacos and tortas and was underwhelmed.   Lamb meat is dry, sauced tortas are drowned in sauce that was a bit too spicy for my liking. The un-sauced tortas made the dryness of the meat more pronounced. If they can't do the basics well, I'm not about to spring for their deluxe Frankenstein concoctions."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch as I needed to do laundry across the parking lot and I am not disappointed. Had an asada taco, fish taco, chicken, pastor and lengua tacos.. all tasted great. Rice and beans were worthy side dishes, one might think how hard is it to make rice and beans...apparently you've might not have eaten in Utah where the local flavor is \"bland\"  If you love Americanized Mexican food and never venture of the well beaten path then do not bother. This restaurant is definitely on the road less traveled and turned out to be a fantastic experience for me.  For you heat and spice lovers you will find the kick here that burns going in and coming out."}
{"text":"Ordered two bean and cheese burritos (one for the girlfriend) and a breakfast burrito thinking I was starving and could eat. Oth...  No way.  These things were huge and I could barely get the breakfast burrito finished.  If it wasn't for the deliciousness of it I may not have. The bean and cheese was amazing later on as well.   Easily one of the best Mexican meals we had in the US and all for under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Don't ever stop to eat here. First, the place it's disgusting cause they don't clean the tables and I asked if they have a restroom and the stupid Hispanic  guy that doesn't even know to speak properly. He answered me the restroom is only for employees. What the fuck!!! What kind of place it this where the costumers can wash their hands . This please should be closed."}
{"text":"My hubby found this little gem. My office eats here at least twice a week. The machaca breakfast is awesome. They're kind, and cook with Love. The prices are great, the food is delicious. They never disappoint. Roberto who????"}
{"text":"Only thing I really enjoyed here was the veneno sauce. The meat was pretty bland. Everything was over priced. Nothing special about it."}
{"text":"WOW!! I was in this neighborhood today taking the Free CCW Class at the Gun Store and being one that supports Local over National Chains (there is a Taco Bell, Arby's, McDonalds & KFC surrounding this place and I DO NOT Eat Crap Fast Food so it was a No Brainer) So I stopped in and got a Chicken Burrito($6.49) and it was probably one of the best I have EVER had and it was HUGE!! I will be making a special trip to go back (like a REWARD after a long bike ride to the end of the valley) and will have them add a little cheese & sour cream. This burrito was  ALL KILLER & NO FILLER with alot of chicken. I'm so glad they are not closer to my neighborhood because it would be so hard to resist not going there several times a week. TRY IT. Period. 24 hour drive thru"}
{"text":"Don't need to be complicated. Just was here for the first time as I was on my way home  from work. This place is SUPER CLEAN and I tried 3 tacos. 1 Pastor, 1 Asada, and 1 Chicken.   All were very good and very fresh and the guy working here was super nice. I asked about the Carbonera as there was a sign and a picture on the wall and it looked great. The guy working told me it was only available on Sat and Sun. I will be back to try it as everything else was very good."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about going to Mexican places. Most of the times I leave disappointed. I ordered the torta ahogada de buche. Let me start off by saying the the salsa they put on it was on point not to thick with a good kick. The bread was soft and moist. It didn't get soggy even though it had the sauce on it. The bouche was delicious properly seasoned and cooked well. The flavor for the price is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Las Famosas de jose  is a better local torta shop.  Better because this Jose guy really puts his special touch to the menu.  The drinks are authentic freshly made staple fruit juices and horchatas/jamaicas made from scratch.  There are different salsa's marked from different regions of Mexico.  Much more than your generic red or green like Robert-o's.  **The super hot salsa sauce that is white colored is liquid fire and I can't get enough of it!**.  Famosas is also known for offering an extensive selection of Mexican meats to choose from.  Anything you could possibly want on a torta, he just may have.  The 1 thing I don't think I saw was tripitas, which I may be wrong about, but it is such an acquired taste anyway. You can order any combination even if it's not on the menu.  The specialty here are the GIANT TORTAS!  They are hee-gan-tay and there are about 6 or so to choose from.  You need to share these with someone or someone's.       The LA PIQUITA is your typical \"kitchen sink\" torta with almost all the meats on the menu including pork leg, milanesa(breaded beef), ham, chorizo, avacado lettuce Oaxaca cheese.  It is literally a double king size torta and it's heavy.  At least 3 lbs guaranteed.  The best part is it is soo damn delicious!  I am not b.s.ing it tastes so good I wish I could eat more than just a half.  After eating half of one you get that \"hit the wall\" signal from your stomach.      I don't really dig south of the border cuisine, personally.  Which you now probably hate me for saying.  Well, I just don't.  This is the one place that I choose to go to when I change my mind.  Better than your taco shop!"}
{"text":"As an SD native now living in nyc you can only imagine my need for Mexican food when I finally get on the west coast. This place is so on point! My burrito is always the size of a small child and the azteca hot sauce is my jam."}
{"text":"I love all they're food. It's a really good Mexican spot & not only that they are open 24hrs. I live literally across town & I come all the way when I have my Mexican food cravings. You can't beat it it's delicious. I've had they're tortas, enchiladas, tacos, and chicken quesadillas everything is on point & they're green sauce is tasty too'"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 sopes for myself and a burrito for my brother. My brother love the burrito and I like my food. The meat was cooked perfect and it was delicious.   I give this place one star for a simple reason. My sopes came with guacamole. It wasn't until I got home and was getting ready to eat that I saw that the guacamole was almost black. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog.   When I went back to the restaurant to have them change it they just looked at me like of there was something wrong with me. After explaining to them that I refuse to eat it because it was obviously very old, they made me fresh sopes WITHOUT guacamole. I expected the guacamole on them but apparently they didn't want to made fresh guacamole.   I'm very disappointed with that simple fact. I refuse to ever go back or even recommend someone to this place. There are places with fresh food that is just as tasty."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Embassy Suites and I was getting hungry.  I decided to do a search and destroy and find me some pizza place to eat at.  I came across this place and looked at it and decided not to eat there.  It just looked gross and there were a few homeless people at the door.  I walked away and pulled up yelp and saw that it got good reviews....hmmmm.  I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Carne Asada Combo.  It came with beans, rice and tortillas and it was damn good!  The portion was amazing and the guy that made it for me was very nice.  Like others have said it is in a bad area, I was ok with it, been in worse, but if you are the yuppie type or scared of these types of places, might be best to stay away.  I wouldn't though, I will be back the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I go here way too much to justify anything but 4+ stars. The number of taco shops on Tropicana between Eastern and Pecos is absurd but not that many are 24 hours. This one is. We usually only go through the drive thru but there's hardly ever a line and it's quick. All of the tacos I've tried are good (carne asada, chicken, pastor) but sometimes the asada can be rather fatty. The quesadillas are pretty standard but come with guacamole and pico so that's a nice touch. It's kind of weird they have small and medium tacos. The small ones are really small but I do prefer two small ones to one medium one because it's more fun? More food?  Anyways the one thing that I love about this place is the extra extra hot sauce they have. I don't know exactly what it's called but we usually say fire and they know what we're talking about. It's a light orange/tan/cream color and it's ridiculously hot. But so good. Like so good I'll keep the container and put it in my cooking to make other things spicy."}
{"text":"I've met the owner of this place a couple of times, he takes pride in his business and only uses fresh ingredients he takes pride in not using anything that is frozen."}
{"text":"Like most people who visit Las Vegas I found myself high on meth and standing outside a cockfight.  I lost virtually all my money on a brown speckled bastard who had less fight in him than an Amish minister on Quaaludes.  As I am watching my soon to be stew meat friend get his eyes plucked out by a bird that looked strangely like Mathew Modine I couldn't fight the sensation that chewing on my bottom lip wasn't going to fill me up. When I was a kid, six or seven, one good hard pull of meth and I wouldn't eat for two days. Nowadays no one has any pride. No one stands behind a product.  I walked down the street cursing the world and wondering what they were teaching kids in schools these days.  I remember like it was yesterday my 4th grade teacher Mr. Huddsfupple telling me, \"Rex, never step too hard on your product, it's bad for business.\"  Two weeks later the FBI arrested him in the parking lot and I was forced to watch him sob like a little girl who lost her doll. Sadly, that pathetic display made me forget his words of wisdom.    With my head pounding, my cash low and my stomach growling I was having a hard time embracing the horror. Flash bang images of dead birds and greedy bastards smiling as they took my money while babbling something in Flemish I made myself a vow...never...ever...go to a Nordic Cockfight again. God damn you Flemish bastards! God damn you to hell, I screamed out loud without realizing it.  I heard someone yell to keep it down. I clinched my fist and looked up to see the person who was about to get a good old thrashing like we did when I was a kid in Nepal. Those Buddhists really had a tenancy to ask for it. Prepared to kick some ass I noticed that no one was around...then it hit me...I was the one who yelled.  All I could see was some yuppie couple crossing the street against traffic, their mouths agape.  Damn tourists. This is Vegas I screamed, and for good measure, I laughed maniacally. They looked scared. Their lesson learned; never leave the Strip if you aren't prepared for what Las Vegas really is all about.    Suddenly the smell hit me. It wasn't all that beef stew looking shit those Flemish scum were jamming down their pasty white gullets...no...this was real food...street food...and most importantly it smelled like cheap food. I can tell the smell of cheap food like I can spot a druid.  I dug through my pocket and found two small bags (don't ask), some cock feathers, a recipe for Springerle, and I can't stand anise.  Finally, under my lucky yoyo and a small picture of Eudora Welty I found a ten dollar bill. Those Flemish pricks didn't get all my money.  I looked towards the smell and saw the sign that changed my life...Aye Jose's Tacos. I wandered inside to this small square building and shakily approached the counter.  The man behind the counter looked strangely like a mix between Enrico Fermi and a dude that once sold me the best bag of weed ever. He asked me how I was doing. Twenty four minutes later, he asked what I wanted to order. I told him I needed two carnitas taco and a lamb chimicanga. Do you want anything to drink he asked? I laughed.  \"Do I look like I need more to drink?\" \"No,\" he responded.\" No you don't.\" He was right.   I sat down at a booth in the small and simply decorated but clean dining area. I sauntered up to the counter, trust me it was a saunter, and looked down at my plate. It was a thing of beauty. Something that stops the heart, freezes the mind and causes uncontrollable drooling.  The chimichanga was a beautiful golden brown with a representation of the colors of Mexico with sour cream, Salsa Verde and red sauce on top. Not too much, just enough to please the eye and add taste.  He asked if I wanted red or green sauce. I told him I want the red, because all of us who have spent time in the great southwest (4 years in an undisclosed New Mexico state facility) know it is the mark of a true Mexican restaurant. The tacos used thin corn tortillas and had the delicious fried pork with diced onions and Salsa Verde. I walked back to the booth and sat down. It took me eight amazing bites of my food to realize that I had inadvertently sat down at a table with two Mexican Mafia members and a hooker with a severe cough. I stared at them blankly and got up. They were confused.  I sat back down at my table and continued my meal.   The chimichanga was cooked perfectly and filled with tender meat in a thin red spicy sauce. The outside was crispy and the tortillas were light and airy.  The oil had only made the tortilla lighter and more delicate. It wasn't heavy and greasy like anything you find at some chain restaurant in a suburban shopping center.  This was the way it was supposed to be. This was the chimichanga Holy Grail. I only say that because for about 5 minutes I saw the Virgin Mary. Nice chick.  The delicate crispy outside was filled with tender lamb and the sauce was deep and flavorful. The red sauce is the best in the city."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars but I maybe rating it to high. So here's the thing my girlfriends dad had a torta  shop in LA so she knows a thing or two about tortas  and according to her the tortas here are delicious . I had the Carne Asada  burrito  I have to say it was pretty good the burrito it's self is huge!!! For me this one was just okay . It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't bad either . I'll be back to try more items from this little hole in the wall ."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to check this place out for a while. Decent sized and typical menu. I opted for an al pastor torta. Unfortunately when I got home realized I was given carnitas.  There was only one lady behind the counter. After finally being acknowledged my order was taken and she prepared my food. There was a salsa bar with 5 different salsas varying from mild to oh dang, that's hot.   My torta was toasty with the required layer of beans on the bottom, layer of smooth guacamole, mayo, meat, lettuce and tomato. It was good, and filling.  I'm unsure of returning despite the food being good, as I was leaving and at the salsa bar stocking up I saw the order taker/ cook handle someone's money and go straight to the griddle where she was cooking. She did not wash her hands!! Now do you ask someone to was their hands and risk her (maybe) sabotaging their food? I tried putting that out of my head but it left me wondering if she had washed her hands after she took MY cash??"}
{"text":"Llegamos de casualidad a este restaurant mis hijos y yo por primera y ultima vez, al entrar se siente un mal olor cuando nos entregan la comida cada taco tenia 5 cucharadas de aceite(lo comprobe precionando un taco) aceite reusado tenia sabor a pescado y para colmo habia cucarachas en la pared lo cual hizo que mis hijos pararan de comer.....a las 3 de la mañana mi hijo se despierta llorando del dolor de estomago.....la peor comida en toda mi vida!!"}
{"text":"I was overdue for a taco fix, so when I was on the east side of town I decided to hit this place up. It's a tiny shop in an older strip mall. Inside there were probably about 10 or so tables and the place definitely has a \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel to it. When I ordered, I did so in English and the lady behind the counter looked a bit puzzled -- probably wondering what this gringo was doing in here. She wanted me to repeat my order so I obliged in my mix of English and broken Spanish (my high school Spanish teacher would have been proud!). It only took a few minutes before my order was up.  The food was more \"meh\" than \"a-ok\" so I'll have to give them 2 stars. The two carne asada tacos I got had plenty of meat, however it wasn't very tender and unlike other taquerias they don't double up the tortillas. Yup, a single tortilla for each taco and each one was dry. The al pastor taco had a weird flavor to it that I couldn't pinpoint -- like a smokey, earthy taste to it. It wasn't my favorite.  Tacos come in a small size ($1.15 ea.) or a regular size ($1.75). After eating three tacos I was still hungry.   They also have a drive-thru. Although I was in and out before the car at the drive-thru got their order. So you might be better off going inside to get your grub."}
{"text":"If I could I could I would give them -5 cause I literally waited in this drive thru line for 45mins total...I aint lying or exaggerating. I literally waited for about 25 minutes before someone popped his head out and started yelling at me in Spanish. After I gave him a confused look he said \"one second\".. then 20 minutes later he looked out the window completely ignores me and goes back to making more food for his friends inside.. by this time two cars has already left and there's a line of 4 still waiting.. and I was in the front.. enough said I think you get the point.. they don't care... simply put.. they either need new workers or more employees.. unremarkably ridiculous."}
{"text":"This places it's awesome! Good quality food, friendly staff and good prices! Tino is the best!"}
{"text":"I go there ATLEAST 2-3x a week! Only because my boyfriend loveeessss their food! But as for me, I will never go there again! Yes the food is great but the server is terrible ! They always charge me different for the same thing I always get ! I'm always getting ripped off & then they give me attitude for trying to explain the price I'm always charged it's ridiculous ! They need to set their staff straight because some of them are a bunch of idiots & probably steal their money since they over charge me! $10 for a $6 burrito? Cmon ! That's like $12 a week I'm getting ripped off from"}
{"text":"Located a bit passed Eastern and Trop, its right next to an auto parts shop. You'll see the colorful building with \"famous Jose\" on it.   Came in on a Saturday lunch hour and there were 2 other parties before us. I noticed only one guy was working the grill and cashier but he was getting food orders quickly and food out to the people.   I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada torta. The bread was crispy and just enough burnt for me to taste. Usually I don't like the burnt taste but this was the right amount. Inside was carne asada, lettuce, sour cream and tomato. I believe adding avocado is extra. That was the regular and it was $6.   I still need to try other dishes they have available so I will definitely be back!   Update!   Had their carne asada nachos one late night! It was muy rica and the customer service was great at 1AM. I advise getting that dish!"}
{"text":"I really wanna give this place 3 stars just for the location and the inside of the restaurant. It's so dingy you wouldn't expect it to be good. But their carnitas tacos are the best I've ever had, everyone should try them. Their horchata isn't bad either. It's definitely more than meets the eye. This place's food is very good, even though it's pretty sketchy at first. Best part? Open 24 hours to satisfy that craving."}
{"text":"Good food, tasted quite authentic. I had a fish, chicken and pork taco and finished them all pretty quickly. The highlight was definitely the fish taco, heaps of avocado and flaky white fish. Very nice, planning to go back."}
{"text":"Torta Milanesa Ahogada!    don't miss the vibrant green salsa in the salsa bar...or the agua frescas."}
{"text":"Ever since my go to place broke my heart time after time.  I have been looking searching and eating, I think I got it!  I have been frequenting this place for awhile but just now getting around for a review!    With that being said this has become 1st choice while looking for a burrito.    Allways a good sign when you walk in and the music (sung in spanish) is on WAY  to loud the second is the sauces.  My boyfriend continues to punish himself for days after and calls his favorite \"I don't think it can be labeled food, how can that be labeled food?!\"  But insists I get him 2 sides of it every time I go! I prefer the mild green sauce.  The Burritos and the size of your forearm, HUGE!  But I love lunch the next day.  The meat has the best flavor I have had in awhile mixed with some of the sauce poured on top, YUM!   There are many other choices but I stick to my usual.   Minimal knowledge of spanish ok and a hungry stomach required!"}
{"text":"Las Famosas is open 24 hours, so if for some reason you find yourself starving at 2am, definitely consider heading their way. I really like the cubano torta. It only comes in a large, just under $10, but 1 sandwich is enough to share or save a portion for the next day. The drive thru is great! If there's a bunch of people inside it's actually faster. The only complaint I'd have is that they're not always consistent in how the sandwich is constructed. Sometimes it's layered well and wrapped tightly (to go) so it stays easy to hold/eat so you can get that \"perfect bite\" all the way through, other times my sandwich just falls apart in my hands. Still, it's always quality ingredients (omg their bread is so good!), good service, and good pricing. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on a whim. No reviews or tips present, along with a cashier that spoke very little English. I was doing a blind buy, hoping for the best.  I had to go with my gut instinct for my first visit. Just by looking around the shop, they seem to really be pushing their tortas with all the posters around the spot-- so I went with that. One that particularly stood out to me was the Cubana: a hefty sandwich packed with beef, marinated pork, chicken, lengua, lamb, and all sorts of other barnyard animals and their parts. There's even a hot dog and a fried egg on top of everything. It was all an overwhelming and unexpected battle for me, but one I was happy to finish. It's a crazy sandwich that's a perfect match for a night of a little too much booze. I wasn't drunk at the time, but I still managed to stuff myself happily.  If you're a braver soul, they have tortas gigantes (gigantic sandwiches), that go for about $18. I'm assuming it's something large enough to feed a small village. Ordering one of these among a group of friends would probably make for a good time.  East side Vegas really has some surprises in the Mexican food scene. This place has turned into my go-to torta spot, which is especially convenient since it's open 24 hours.  Note: There's a $0.50 surcharge for credit/debit purchases."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many taquerias being Mexican & all & I can say the Carne Asada burrito was the best I've ever had.It was at least 1 1/2 lb. & the salsas were all REALLY good.If you like hole in the walls & authentic Mexican I suggest eating here"}
{"text":"What an unexpected and amazing place.  My family and I were in Las Vegas to celebrate my parent's 30th wedding anniversary.   One day the women decided to hit the Wynn Spa so I took my dad out to a shooting range to blow some money and waste some ammo.  On the way we were on the lookout for lunch and being not far from the strip most of the choices were of the chain variety.  You know the horror, you are on vacation and you want something local and the only thing you see are a flurry of McDonalds, Arbys, Burger King and whatever other regional fast food chain.    We initially pulled into Arbys but much to my surprise across the street much like a distant gastromirage I spotted it.  Ay!  Jose Takos!  I informed my father that we are headed to \"that place\" - he was a bit skeptical.  Now keep in mind this is a very nondescript corner building in a strip mall and from the outside some may even think that it is scary.  We park and make our way into the cozy spot.  The inside is typical of mom-and-pop restaurants.  This is a no frills spot, basically no decoration, just a few tables and a counter where you order.    The menu is very basic; you have an assortment of meats in which to choose to make tacos, chips and salsa and a few other Mexican food mainstays.  They have a very authentic menu of meat selections with selections such as tongue, head, a couple different types of steak, etc.  My father and I opted for steak and were we surprised.  Outside of In-N-Out (I am a total In-N-Out fiend), the Wynn Buffet and BOA at Caesars this was probably the best meal of our week long trip.    We initially got 3 tacos each which are served very simple with tortilla, your chosen meat filling, cilantro and onion.  Clean, simple and dirt cheap.  They were so tasty I went back and got 2 more.  I recommend this place highly to anyone in the area that wants to get away from the Strip and the bad food or any locals that love Mexican food and are looking for a new spot.  To top it off for all you late night partiers the drive through is 24-hours."}
{"text":"Was passing through on the way from the airport to our hotel and saw this little spot.  Definitely a ghetto shopping plaza with some shady characters, but you could tell from the outside that this was authentic Mexican. Went inside and ordered two carnitas burritos and flautas with chicken.   The burritos are enormous!! Don't understand all these people who are complaining about the price. $6.45 for a loaded carnitas burrito that weighed around 3lbs.   The one mistake we made was not getting the sauces.  You really need to add the sauces to you burrito or else it will be a bit dry as they don't add any to it.   Overall sweet little find and so worth the stop."}
{"text":"I had brunch here last week. This place is open 24 hours and is located a few blocks from where I lived. My boyfriend read a lot of good reviews about this place so we decided to try it out. I ordered chorizo and eggs. I was influenced by my friend to order this dish as I normally would not. I wasn't particulary happy about my choice as my boyfriends order was far more tastier than mine. He had the Carne Asada tacos. I had a bite of his tacos and thought they were a lot better than Roberto Taco Shop and Felipitos taco shop which are both near me. They had a very large menu.  It is a very tiny restaurant. A typical hole in the wall with good Mexican food. I would return again, and try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years...my review is long over due. They serve the best Mexican food I've had so far in Vegas. It's all well prepared, presented well, and the workers are cheerful. And of course it's nice and clean in the dining room. It's in a dumpy neighborhood but stands out."}
{"text":"To be honest nothing special...but the place is the onlything open late as fuck around town ...cheap product sold for more then its worth ...aka too much for the qaulity....chicken was sodium through the roof, my friend took few bites and couldnt eat the rest ... Itasted it and it was pretty bad ...The beef is real low qaulity...not very fresh ...well goin there had a some what gross feelin about the place first impression was this place looks like a roach box ... I wouldn't come again .... I dont like to post bad reviews and always try to stay positive when it comes to writing them ....but yeah .... I guess only thing good about this place is its open 24 hours ... The chicken burrito tasted like caned chicken /tuna .... That was just way too salty... I just feel they can do alot better ... Just very low qaulity mexican food they have to step it up if they wanna survive here in vegas ...sorry ...but not sorry ....i just wouldnt recommend...."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas my whole life. And no one has better mexican food than las famosas de jose. I compare them to a really great place I love in LA. The staff is always awesome. There's usually only one person working for some reason. But they handle it well.  Its worth the wait. They make it so delicious  enough said"}
{"text":"Very great food. My husband and I went late night and the staff was very friendly. We ordered a burrito and a torta. Very flavorful and filling. The portions are fairly big and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"For Tortas This is the place to visit! The prices are very affordable and the quality on the meat they use is good I love the steak torta it is my favorite I also love their Habanero salsa it is unique in town and I have to advise you it is super hot so if you can't handle spices you have to avoid this salsa but if you enjoy salsas this is the one you wanna try. I have also in the past tried pork Torta and it is also a good one ;)"}
{"text":"Another great find off the beaten path.  I ordered two cabeza, two carne asada, two al pastor and one fish taco.  Off all of them the al pastor were the best.  The cabeza was great and the carne asada, according to my dining partners was \"pretty good.\"  The fish taco turn out to be grilled tilapia.  My partner was expecting the baja style deep fried.  I brought it back to the counter and asked if they indeed offered that variety of fish taco.  The owner/cook explained that they only have one deep fryer, primarily for french fries and that frying fish in it would taint the oil.  Perfectly understandable.  But here's where it gets good.  He offered to make another taco, any version I wanted and to go ahead and keep the fish offering.  He understood that my partner didn't like it but insisted that I enjoy it myself.  I have to admit, it wasn't my style either.  HA!  Minutes later not only did he bring back a replacement taco, but two of them!  Outstanding customer service.  They have a self serve salsa bar that has a better than average selection of salsas, a highlight being a very unusual white based sauce that was very spicy.  Cheers for offering a Oaxacan based, very very rare salsa.   Limes and carrots are also offered.  May be considered by many to be a Yelp 3 star, but the customer service absolutely bumps this place to a 4 star.  Buche, birria and other varieties of tacos are offered.  Location may seem somewhat undesirable, but it is what it is.  I will be back and would recommend the place to anyone jonesing for tj style tacos.  About 1.5 miles from the strip."}
{"text":"I don't know about anyone else, but until looking this place up on Yelp, I thought this place was called \"Aye Jose Takos\", because that's what the sign says from the road.  So I somewhat refuse to call it \"Las Famosas de Jose\" because I like the name Aye Jose better.    I live a stone's throw from Aye Jose and come here on a weekly basis.  I am from the LA area, and if there's one thing I miss the most, it's the abundance of 24-hour street taco restaurants.  This is Las Vegas' version of one of those 24-hour LA street taco places.  While it has much more than street tacos, I think the tacos and burritos are the best things on the menu, and the only things really worth getting.    If there is one thing at Aye Jose that sticks out as the absolute best, it is definitely the Chorizo Tacos.  They are some of the best I've ever had.  If you don't like grease, then you will not like this dish, but it's not a bad greasy.  The grease doesn't come from them throwing lard into it, because they don't.  The grease comes from the fat that makes up chorizo sausage.  When they saute the chorizo, the red-colored, flavorful oils come out of the chorizo and into the tortilla.  This is what makes the chorizo taco so good.  So you should definitely get one when you're here, considering they are under a buck, i believe around 90 cents.   I also really enjoy their carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor tacos.  If you're a street taco connoisseur then you will not be impressed with these tacos.  But if you are hungry for street tacos at 2 am then you will love these tacos!     The drive-thru at Aye Jose is probably one of the worst I've ever seen, and they often take a while to make your order, but this may be because my orders are rather large when I'm bringing tacos back to an apartment full of hungry friends."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I lived in the area. I usually order asada tacos, tortas, or their shrimp Coctel. All are really good, cheap and much better tasting than food I have tried at Roberto's. I crave their green sauce. It tastes good on everything! Oh yeah their agua de piña is pretty good too. My only complaint is that the meat could be a bit more tender."}
{"text":"Went over during Lunch Hour. Wasn't busy so service was quick and friendly.   But as soon as I walked in I noticed a smell, like a sewage smell. So I made that order to go! It's unpleasant for folks thinking about dining in and I hope they fix it in the near future.   The food wasn't too shabby. I ordered a Torta de Carne Asada, $6.   Affordable prices and decent food."}
{"text":"CARNITAS DRY AND OVERCOOKED. I love Mexican dives as much as anyone and was excited to try this place. Drive through connected to an auto repair shop - perfect. 24 hour drive through - perfect. The young lady at  the drive up window was nice but the food has to deliver.   I'm used to taco trucks and dives in LA charging around $2 for a street taco so I figured at $3 this place better be amazing. I ordered two carnitas tacos with verde sauce. $6 and change. Got home and unwrapped the goods.   Tacos were small. Two slices of lime that were old and dry. When I squeezed them over my tacos like one drop came out. Took a bite of my first taco and was mad. Meat was dry and overcooked like it had been laying in a pan all day. That was frustrating when all you want is a couple good tacos for dinner. I opened the taco up and looked at the meat. Yea, I might feed it to my dog. It all went in the trash along with my $6.  My advice: watch your consistency because in the food industry you rarely get a second chance after a bad first experience. You could have looked at the meat and known full well it was stale and dry. You knew that about the lime too. It's impossible to be in the restaurant business and not know.   Conclusion: overpriced, poor quality meat, fail. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS PLACE, but I just didn't.  One evening, driving around running errands, just wanted a classic, divey, street taco. Haven't found a solid Mex place like that but Las Famosas looked like the perfect spot. At the tail end of an auto repair shop, it looked promising.   Ordered two carnitas tacos with verde sauce. Over $6. A little pricey for two small tacos. Oh well, hoped they were amazing.   They weren't. They just weren't. The lime, which came with the taco, literally had no juice when squeezed. Dry.  The carnitas meat was tough and obviously laying around for quite some time. Dog gone it! I threw it all in the trash at home after the first bite. Very frustrating when you're excited to try something new and it just turns out to be garbage.   You should know better. You know full well when meat and lime for that matter, is fresh or if it should be tossed. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had always been wanting to come to this place because I heard of the sizes of their tortas, but I had never had the chance until now. First I have to say and emphasize that if you're not a major eater, or hungry then you should not think about this place unless you have company since their meals are good for 2 or 3 people.  I had La Thalia, which is a huge torta with a milanesa, tomatoes, avocado, eggs, beans etc. and a side of fries. The torta was good, it was not super tasty, not had special flavors to it, just the regular tastes of the ingredients. The torta was super loaded, which was hard to bite into but I can't complain about that, I knew that was coming. The veneno sauce and zapoteca sauce did add flavor to the torta and made it much more enjoyable and gave it great flavor. The customer service was average as per the Las Vegas standard; however, by the Mexican culture and standard, which the business is based off from, it is outstanding. The prices are awesome as well; $20 for a meal of that size is very acceptable and cheap. The eating area was a bit messy. The tables were not clean after the customer who ate there before I arrived. Mess was not big but I could tell the tables needed a wiping. The floors also needed to be mopped but nothing serious. Surprisingly enough, the kitchen area was very clean which I loved and was very pleased about, which ultimately is where my food was made. Overall, I liked it and surely will come back, but it doesn't have very special features other than the size of their tortas and burritos."}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing food!! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who really enjoys REAL authentic Mexican food! :) sooo don't complain about the wait! It takes time to make good food!"}
{"text":"I keep trying new taco places in Henderson/LV but they keep disappointing me! I don't know why i keep wanting to explore when I've already found a place that I love! (Taco y Taco)  I was craving a fish taco and put that into Yelp. Most of the results were Rubio's - which I totally would have been okay with because I wanted a crispy taco! But we decided to try out Las Famosas de Jose.  FOOD: I got a fish taco and an al pastor burrito. My eating buddy got a Ferdo 3 lb burrito. Our total was about $25 which means the giant 3 lb burrito was about $15! Yikes.  The fish taco was soooo disappointing!! Grilled and the fish was in cubes. Very little flavor, I dumped a bunch of salsa on it. The al pastor burrito was better but it was mostly meat and I prefer a little more balance in my burritos. It also started falling apart when I ate it because they wrapped it in paper and not foil. The 3 lb burrito is HUGE, cut in half - each half was the size of my regular burrito. I had a bite and liked it! Just not for the price.  Salsa bar was ooook. Not too many spicy options and no cilantro/onion!  The workers were very nice though - I asked for a piece of foil to wrap up the remainder of my my burrito and a plastic bag to carry everything. I asked for a water cup but they said they were out of the small cups and couldn't give one to me. What??? Never heard that excuse before.  VENUE: No frills place. You order at the counter and pick up your food there. They have forks, spoons and knives available for you and you can leave your tray on the table once you're finished. NO bathroom, but there's a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall.  Location is a bit sketch so keep your eye out at night!"}
{"text":"the place is now closed. out of business at this location. as of jun/11/15 I liked from here the chilaquiles with carne asada & the salsa verde, I need to find a new spot for mexican food..."}
{"text":"Caution was there last Monday night cook/cashier was very friendly, but the food got me sick for 3days FOOD POISONING I had 3carne asada 1carnitas and 1alpastor tacos. This was my first and last time here. I  went there because of the good ratings it had."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything on the menu is made from scratch, including the chips & salsas and the drinks mixed up in glass jugs that they scoop out with a ladle. I usually get soft tacos and horchata, but the huevos rancheros are pretty good too. They've got the standard variety of meats and then a few others including tongue,  cheek & goat occasionally. Plus when he's there (he has 2 locations) the owner Jose is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito so big it's kinda daunting to try to eat all by yourself.  Luckily that is no my order, but my other half.  Lengua tacos to die for.  All fresh and made right there with all the sauce you can ask for.  Very funny stickers and art on the walls and there is a drive thru.  24 hour drive thru is also a blessing because who doesn't want Mexican food at 4am.  There is a lot more on is menu to order but as for right now I love the lengua tacos and Mexican coca cola bottles.   Decently priced also makes this place a must go to."}
{"text":"I feel like I just exited the Twilight Zone.  One hour. An ENTIRE hour in the drive thru!  I pulled up at 10:23. Ahead of me; a Black pickup and a Grey Acura. Having waited here before, I knew there'd be a wait. And as time ticked the f*ck by, I kept up a conversation with myself, questioning if my Fried tortilla craving was worth it.  But I waited! Like a good girl with a growling stomach, I waited.  My review may confuse you, because I know you see the 4 stars sitting above my text. Right?   No worries. Just listen.  Because, at last...I'm home, now.    I eventually got to order a Carne Asada Chimichanga . I intended on having two small tacos along side it (one Pastor, and the other carnita) but through broken English I understood that the ONLY meat they had was Carne Asada.   Like, really.  No chicken...nothing.   So I'm like, \"Alright, I've waited this long, what am I gonna do?! Go to Taco Bell across the street?!\"  Of course, not.   So, I order.  And I wait.  All the while monitoring the impatience of the driver of the black truck behind me.  At one point, I wanted to open to door and shout, \"I feel your pain, bro!\" My better judgment stifled the sound in my throat tho, and I continued to wait.  Every once and a while, I ease off my brake because I am SURE that my time has come and I'm readying to pull off with my chimichanga.  But after a few false starts, I put my car in park and continue to wait.  Right before I see my Glorious chimichanga heading in my direction, I see the cook chewing on food.  I wanted to record a 'Wtf?!' Type Vine. But, no.   FINALLY, foods in my hands and after paying, I drive off onto the awkward ramp like exit into Tropicana from  the plaza where La Famosa sits.   And now I'm here. HOME! After legitimately almost falling asleep in the drive thru.  And my 4 stars?? Well... My food is BOMB!  Damn it all, this sucker is GOOD!!  For me a street culinary experience is entirely different than a fine dining experience. (obvious reference there, BUT!...!)  I expect to be treated like Elizabeth Taylor when I'm paying a $200 bill at Jaleo.  But if I'm in the mood for a taco and a Chimichanga? I'll totally take the \"Tio doesn't know how to manage his grill time, but makes the best Chimichangas...!\" vibe over a hungry Mexican-food craving stomach growl  any day!  To wrap it up, yes I waited a portion of a part time job in the Drive Thru of 'La Famosa' tonight. And while that's totally NOT okay. (AT ALL!) My Chimi was DELISH!   With all being said, the owners of this place need to understand that if I'm ( I, being any consumer) craving a good plate of casual Mexican food, I'm likely going to go with the restaurant that will serve me my food WHILE  my craving is active. Nostalgic Tio atmosphere, be dammed.  I'm just saying."}
{"text":"Great burrito on the way out of town- the perfect hangover food! Very authentic mexi!"}
{"text":"Pretty small inside, but the food was pretty good. I love a good salsa bar and this one didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Ate here because I was craving tacos. The price was good for what it came with, Everything: Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole & Lettuce. The salsas are also very tasty, my favorite were the hotter ones. The employee at that moment was working alone, managing both taking orders and making the orders. She was very polite and professional also speaking fluent English & Spanish which is a big plus! Her name was Maria. Sorry to hear it's going to close soon, I'll try to be back before that happens!"}
{"text":"I've been working a grave route on the west side for a while, so I knew my favorite places over therw. Work changed and put me south. Found this place by chance and wasn't disappointed. Great food and open all hours."}
