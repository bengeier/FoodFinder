{"text":"We had the Prairie hash skillet and the mushroom saute, it was the best hash skillet I've ever had, and the poached eggs were the most beautiful egg I've ever seen, and the mushrooms were amazing to say the least."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, you walk in and want to stay for a while - especially given the comfy couch bench and pillows. Great service and coffee during our brunch. You can tell quality is important here. We had duck confit poutine and the hash skillet, both were tasty but needed a bit more salt. The hash skillet was a bit on the small side. The truffle oil was a nice surprise in the poutine. Wondered if hollandaise would have been a better choice than gravy on the poutine - especially for brunch? Regardless it was a good experience."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday last night and the food was ok but the service was terrible! We were waiting 20 mins for drinks and we were the only table in the place! We were all very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place - great food - great atmosphere - love this place! They have a great menu and the service is amazing!  Friendly staff and experienced knowledgeable servers - will definitely be back and recommend to everyone too"}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this lovely restaurant with killer patio? Maybe because it is next to the gallery everyone assumes it is crazy expensive but it isn't. Pretty average price for brunch but the quality is fantastic. Had the Forest Mushroom Saute & Poached Eggs - though originally that there would be too much runny sauce with the mushrooms but as it cooled slightly it thickened out beautifully, also just rich enough but not too much. My partner had Prairie Hash Skillet with fried eggs - the chunks of pork belly were well crisp and plentiful. So glad we ordered 2 different dishes so I could get a taste of both. The patio is glorious in the morning sunshine with umbrellas scattered around - only concern is if it is scorching there may not be enough umbrellas but this is a place I would be happy to wait for the table I want. You should go and eat everything! Looking forward to trying dinner too."}
{"text":"Incredible food and adequate wine list.  This is a very small restaurant, less than 10 tables.  But the food is top notch.  I had the duck breast with the potstickers with the Bliss pinot noir.  Everything was delicious.  The food here is innovative and extremely tasty. The waitress was very pleasant but didn't hang around too much.  Overall I was very impressed and will return."}
{"text":"Ok, so we walked by and saw a sign for Wine & Art, went to the gallery underneath, saw some cool art, had some Cava and then went up to the restaurant for dinner service.

We were the only table seated at 6:40pm. We ordered 2 drinks, 2 apps and 2 entrees. My partner is vegan, and there were very few options that are even vegetarian, but this IS Calgary, so that can be forgiven. When we asked, the server gave a couple of vegan options, namely salad and truffle fries.

So, the server was good and the food tasted great. 
Why two stars?
First, my partner got his food first, and they forgot to make it vegan for him so we sent it back.
They remade it pretty quickly and got it back to him vegan.
But still, my food (Brussel sprouts and risotto) was no where to be found.
10 mins later, still no food.
15 mins later, still no food. And now my partner was finished his meal.
20 mins later, my food came.
I've never heard of anything like this before (ordering at the same time and getting food out so far apart) it was very embarrassing!

The server was very apologetic and you could hear him trying to motivate the kitchen, but to no avail.

Afraid we won't be going back, which is too bad because it's pretty close to home and the food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Cozy venue with awesome music, great food, and a dynamite staff (although sadly my awesome waitress was off to Vancouver).

Not many tables, but the set-up seems to be most efficient with the space they have, when the weather heats up then they'll double availability with the outside area (although on a busy street, not much of a view).  For food got the brussel sprouts and duck poutine to start, both were really good but maybe a touch to much of truffle (oil?) on the fries (too much seemed to take away from the meat flavor in my opinion).  Got the ribs for the entree, which were awesome, meat was soft and sauce had great taste and right amount of spice - should get there for there all you can eat night!"}
