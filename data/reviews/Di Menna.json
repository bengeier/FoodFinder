{"text":"Overrated. First of all, the decor is dark, gloomy and almost gave me the impression that I was trapped! I don't even know if there are windows that AREN'T covered up.   The food was not that good for the price and at their prices, I am GOING to expect better. Their chicken wasn't marinated properly, it was dry and took me forever to eat as a result. Potatoes were a tad over-cooked. Their pasta wasn't terrible, but definitely not to my liking. The chef's didn't know the definition of \"too much\" cream sauce. It tasted like Alfredo sauce with one or two noodles inside. It was as though I ASKED for extra, extra sauce (I did not). I will write that the service was super friendly...at least."}
{"text":"Better atmosphere and price given the level or service and quality of food compared to Gallo Nero. Went for a large family gathering and everyone enjoyed themselves in the private room. Best lamb chops I've had in a while"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant November 12, 2013: Boring, needs significant renovation, lack luster restaurant. Food is OK but unimaginative. Menu and ambiance dates back to the 70s. Why go there? Many other options at that price point.  I understand that they have renovated significantly;  I will take the time to go again to check it out.  I looked at the menu on the their site and it looks unchanged, but will see."}
{"text":"Great Italian food at a reasonable price. They're open late so you have lots of options regardless of what time you visit."}
{"text":"Un voyage dans le temps! Décors kitsch, portion gargantuesque. Manque un peu de finesse dans l'exécution. Personnellement, je ne suis pas un fan, mais peut plaire aux mélancoliques du temps qui passe."}
{"text":"While I was in Montreal months ago I was told by a few people that Di Menna was decent and being close to where i was staying it would be convenient to go to.  No one really ranted or raved about this place.  All I got was it was just OK.  Well I then resulted to Yelp and again the reviews were not very good.  This did not stop me from going.  So let me start off by saying that when it comes to Italian restaurants I have pretty high standards seeing as I am Italian.  What I have to say is how high are some peoples standards to say that Di Menna is JUST OK or to give it very low reviews.  Have peoples taste buds been fried.  Do people not know the true quality of food anymore.  Out of all the Italian places that I have been to and you all know that I have been to a lot.  I have to say that the absolute BEST tomato sauce I have ever tried including home made comes from Di Menna.  I ordered the seafood pasta and it was just incredible.  The portion was huge but was so good that it still left me wanting more.  If Di Menna was located in Toronto I would probably go broke from wanting to eat here every day lol.  Other than the food the service was pretty good and apparently it was just renovated to its pretty trendy and modern as well.  My next visit to Montreal Di Menna will be the first place I visit."}
{"text":"Sweet & sour experience.  Firstly the good...... The portions are big and the taste is decent.  The bad..... -The price is extremely expensive considering the product. It cost $160 for two people ???? For 1 entree, 2 main meals, 2 desserts and 4 glasses of wine.  -the decor is unique (vintage) and some might like the look, but I'm not one of those.  Basically for pizza and pasta, you need to get a loan at the bank.  Overall would not go back because it's super expensive for what your getting. Much better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the food!! It's a bit pricey, but affordable. Service was a bit long, and they forgot my drink order. I would definitely go back !!!"}
{"text":"Firstly just want to point out that my 3star rating for this place is not because I had a bad experience but just because there are some things that need improvement. So first off the space is very nice and modern with lots of seating and nice lighting. We tried the Di menna special pizza and arancini . The pizza is not bad it's more montreal style pizza (thicker crust and topping) and the special has meat sauce instead of regular pizza sauce which was a nice touch but the dough was a little too thick and could have used a longer cook. The arancini was tasty. The issue was not that the food was no good but rather that everything on the menu was way overpriced -while the portions were big , it's not fine dining or expensive ingredients so the pricing to me was a problem. Service was good but we had so many different waitresses come by that it would get a little confusing. They also had a man playing live music walking around which actually was more distracting than pleasant. Overall this wasn't a bad experience by any means and I would recommend you to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Family owned and run business since 1971.  What a wonderful selection of homemade pastas along with a variety of poultry and seafood selections.  I indulged in the Fettucine Alla Gigi and never looked back!"}
