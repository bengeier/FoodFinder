{"text":"The Bocce staff always makes us feel welcome. Our group of seven had great service - always attentive, but never rushed. We shared some olives, caesar and kale salads, and a couple of pizzas (fungi and margarita). With some house white and red wine, it was a perfect meal for a group of friends wanting to catch up in a relaxed and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh take on Italian.
Refreshing drinks, killer thin crust pizzas.
Excellent service.
Cool vibe 
Hotspot."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Bocce. I always come here whenever I get a chance. The food is amazing and the ambiance is nice. I always get lost in the pizza twirling. 

My only negative feedback was from my last visit a few weeks ago. We came with a large party and so we were charged gratuity (which is totally fine) but, no one told us about the gratuity when we sat down, just that it would all be on one bill (which we were okay with). So when I got the bill I tipped an additional 15% on top of the 18% - which adds up when you're paying a bill for 8+ people. It would have been nice if the server had let us know when the bill arrived that gratuity had already been charged to the bill - I find this practice is pretty standard in most restaurants. She must have thought I was just very generous. 

(It is also my fault for not looking carefully at the bill - but after a couple glasses of wine.... As a side note I tend to tip on top of gratuity at least twice a year +_+)

I still love Bocce though."}
{"text":"I give this 5-stars for the PIZZA only (because I have had not ordered the other menu items).

The pizza here is the most excellent \"traditional Italian style\" pizza in Calgary. I have tried dozens of these places in search of a new \"go-to\" one and THIS IS IT. They give UNA Pizza a run for their money. 

All of the pizzas are amazing, my favorites are the Calabrese and Funghi, which are always cooked to perfection. I also like the fact that the food quality is consistent. I usually order the Tallegio Friti salad to accompany my pizza, which is also super delicious (if you like truffle oil).

Price-to-Quality:
Excellent. I have no trouble dishing out $20/pizza for an excellent pizza. They are really high quality and one pizza is very filling for one person!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are AMAZING (tried the Pascolo and Funghi) so is the Crispy Calamari, and Prawns for appetizers!"}
{"text":"I must admit the pizza looked great. Unfortunately we both had pasta which left a lot to be desired. The service was good but the pasta was bland. There is little chance that I will return but if I do it will definitely be the pizza for me."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, cool interior and a really nice chef in the open kitchen. Service OK."}
{"text":"I search from Yelp and got me here. It was quick lunch before going to the airport. Spaghetti Bolognese and Caesar salad are really good."}
{"text":"Classy yet laid back vibes, fun location and fantastic gluten free options! The pizzas are creative yet simple and absolutely delicious. The \"funghi\" pizza is one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! Food and service were fabulous.  There is only one small complaint, the tables for two are a little small for all the water and wine carafes they give you plus pizza plates etc.  Everything else was great, servers were friendly and pizza was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I don't give 5 star very often. Great service, they were all just so great! Amazing food! The cooks were relaxed and everyone was on. Great ambience, a feel good environment. Happy. Thanks Bocce"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad. The pizza was great along with the service but the other dish we had was soso. It tasted quite bitter and didn't have great flavour but not terrible. I believe it was the spaghetti carbonara. We also had the antipasti board to start. It was ok but we would have preferred if there was some sort of jam and bread. But the good thing with the board is there was SO MUCH MEAT!! Overflowing with meat! Yummy but room for improvement for sure."}
{"text":"Great food - great atmosphere- reasonable prices. This place has a selection of seating which is good, depending on how many are in your party. The pizzas and salads are especially good, But the pastas are ... but I am not a pasta person, so shouldn't comment. The wine is served in little juice glasses (not impressive for an Italian).Staff are very pleasant. The place is an off-shoot of Mercato's on the opposite side of 4th. Mercato's has a little bar and somewhat more classy: white table covers, stem wine glasses, and of course excellent food.)"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in Calgary (trumping others in the local area, Una, Famoso etc).  The atmosphere and service is as strong as the pizza.

The calamari was perfectly done with a nice twist and the Isola pizza was scrumptious.

Food, Service, Vibe AWESOME!"}
{"text":"There are a lot artesian pizza placing popping up around Calgary, and I wanted to try Bocce so my sister and her boyfriend joined me. 

We got the calamari, quattro formaggi and funghi pizza to share. The calamari was really delish and had a bit of a kick to it. The pizzas were really good too, the thin crust stayed crispy and held up the topping really well.

The upside of thin crust is you get to enjoy the toppings more and you don't get too full from dough (so you can eat more pizza lol) 

The ingredient on the pizzas here are simply, but fresh and I really like that. I will definitely be adding Bocce to my rotation of pizza places I go on the regular."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood (Mission) Italian trattoria. Great pizza (try the funghi) and the best calamari I've had in Calgary! Good wine list, casual vibe. Open for lunch and dinner and I always have had great service."}
{"text":"Bocce is great for casual Italian fare. It's a nice little spot thats great for a date or to catch up with friends over pizza and a glass of wine (they have some pretty neat cocktails too). Nice decor, clean environment and prompt service most of the time.

There is a good selection of pizzas and other tasty treats. Ive tried a few now an haven't been disappointed. The servers are knowledgable and can make some great menu recommendations. The cheese pizza is one of my faves as is the mushroom one. But again, everything is quite tasty (try the meatballs to start).

It can get quite noisy in there when its full - making conversation at your table more like yelling at each other. One of those places you leave and realize how quiet traffic on 4th street can seem."}
{"text":"I have been to Bocce half a dozen times in the past several months.

The food is DELICIOUS

The wait staff is TERRIFIC

I AM NOT GOING BACK ..........

The noise level is UNACCEPTABLE. .....

Impossible to have a conversation with people at your table......without YELLING. .....

I do not understand the need for music blaring out of numerous speakers......nobody goes there to listen to music......they go to drink, eat , and TALK  to the people they are sharing a meal with. The elevated level of the music forces you to yell at people across the table....and when the restaurant is even half full all those voices yelling...music blaring....ruin the meal...

John Gilchrist .....Calgary Herald columnist. ....has started a list of restaurants with a LOW NOISE level.......you can Google his list

Bocce will NOT  be on the list...

I will not be at Bocce....."}
{"text":"Everything was really good - had the spaghetti bolognese and eggplant pizza w red sauce. Delicious. Good service."}
{"text":"Decent food, below average service. My boyfriend and I went to Bocce for the first time this weekend and were not impressed with the service we received. Our server greeted us by saying \"do you want wine or beer?\" - no hello, how are you, etc. My boyfriend's pizza arrived 15 minutes before my pasta did and he waited politely for my meal to arrive before he started eating. Our server walked by several times while the pizza was sitting there and didn't say a word. Finally she said \"they're plating the pasta,\" and walked away. I had the spaghetti carbonara and he had the four cheese pizza and they were both fine, nothing to rave about though. With the number of great Italian restaurants in Calgary with better food and service, I don't think we will be returning to Bocce."}
{"text":"Great pizza, prawns with beans, and muscles. But I honestly think that the calamari appetizer is the best in Calgary. The calamari is filleted which makes it tender, it has a salty crunch, and the sauce is spicy, but not inferno hot."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this place the moment I walked in the door and the menu has enough options to please a fair array of people, but not too many to be overwhelming. 

We had the margherita pizza and the chicken parm with carbonara on the side, and both were fantastic and fair portions. The carbonara is amazingly creamy - \"total breakup food\" as I describe it.

The last couple slices of my pizza were supposed to be packed up, but somehow were forgotten or went straight into the bin, so the server (who was pleasant and perfectly attentive throughout dinner) ended up bringing our a full pizza for us. That's service. The few dollars cost that was to the restaurant in ingredients was the assurance that we'll be back, frequently."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The service is awesome. Dropped by on a late afternoon during the week and mmm delicious. Had the eggplant parmigiana sandwich which is was awesome and mama mista salad with freshly ground pepper. It was super fresh which topped the delicious factor. Definitely recommend for a good lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the restaurant itself because my lovely co-worker picked us up a couple pies for a Christmas lunch in December. 

The piece of pizza I had was so heavy and oily that I couldn't have another slice. I spent the rest of the afternoon feeling very ill. This could have just been my own issue and I chose the wrong pizza to indulge. I believe it was called Boscheto... Any who, the other two pizzas also looked very greasy and just unappealing. 

Maybe i'll give it another go in the actual restaurant. Someday."}
{"text":"Really good location! It has a nice design and space layout. It is ideal for casual occasions like dinner with family or friends or even a date when you don't know the other person very well. The food is fairly priced given the quality and quantity of food you get. The flavours are a bit rich if you are on a diet -it's Italian after all."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, including great gluten free crust.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and very good service as well."}
{"text":"First time there. Very busy with all ages groups covered. Service was very good. Restaurant tastefully decorated.  Oven fired pizza will always be a favorite for me. Warm olives assortment was really tasteful and flavorful."}
{"text":"My first visit here. Since I stayed in a hotel downtown it cost me around 20 minutes to walk there but it's worth it! Really nice athmosphere in a brandnew building. Young, friendly and motivated crew.

I had the olives as a starter. Well they were warm. Never had olives warm before. New taste (probably to intense) but still ok. However, I prefer them cold (also it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the menu that they are heated up).

As a main course I've choosen the momma mista salad and the spaghetti bolognese. Both outstanding! Wow! I live in Switzerland - not too far away from the italian border so I'm kind of a hard judge but those guys did a great job! Very authentic taste.

The dessert was a home made tiramisu. Well I have no idea why but so many restaurants try to be fancy in terms of decorating an italian dessert. Why? Just do it the way they do it in bella Italia: layered and without tropical fruits! It was ok but I'll have an alternating choise next time.

All in all still a great place to visit and it's already on my to-do list for my next trip to Calgary."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst meal I have ever had. Pizza was soggy in the middle and over cooked at the outer crust. It was a very bad night for the kitchen, the couple sitting at the bar had to send their pizza back twice. The second try was so badly burnt it was inedible. How does any decent kitchen send something like that out? Hard to think of a reason to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Came to Bocce for the first time for a birthday and was a bit shocked to see how busy it was. This place is usually packed on the weekends but they are still able to squeeze you in without reservations. The decor and staff were very friendly and accommodating to our large group. The pizza was really well done and their stacking pizza method works since the table room is already limited. 

The only thing I would've liked to see more variety of pizza with different kinds of meat, such as chicken. I wasn't able to try the pancetta because of the bacon but it looked darn good. I had the funghi pizza which was very delicious and i really enjoyed the meal. 

Would definitely recommend =)"}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing! The crust is delicious and light. 
Our server was great, she made suggestions and recommended the tiramisu ( amazing ) 
Will be back!"}
{"text":"**Warning: If you take a bday cake, they charge a $25 plating fee. Yes...$25...**

I've now had lunch and dinner at Bocce. I haven't really been impressed either time. Their pizza is like a cross of Neapolitan and North American (not super thin, but not thick, crispy, not chewy). I find the crust pretty dry and the bottom is too crispy for me. The melanzana pizza last night was definitely missing something, it had roasted eggplant and roasted garlic which sounds amazing but it just wasn't. 

Their mussels for appetizers were great. If I eve go back, I'd get them again. Calamari is ok, but mussels were better. We hear the kale salad was good too. Prices are a bit high for the food. Especially given the cake plating fee (wtf?!) for 10 ppl... $250 per person? I dunno, it just brought them down in my books. 

For similar prices I prefer amazing Italian at 500 Cucina in Inglewood."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Bocce on the weekend.  It was very quiet - for awhile we were the only ones in there.  The server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Two of us had pizza and they were both quite tasty.  Friend number three had the spaghetti bolognese and said it was also good.  All in all, totally decent."}
{"text":"Meh.  The food is quite disappointing given the price point.  I understand how it it is the spot to dine given its lively ambiance but the food doesn't match.  We had mussels as appetizer and it was a bit fishy-like in that it wasn't the freshest nor was the sauce very tasty.  The short ribs were plentiful as was the polenta but really was quite bland.  Spaghetti bolognese was just ok.  Mushroom pasta dish for our allergy kid was passable but nothing to write home about.  
Maybe their pizza which is suppose to be there speciality is better.  
Service was chaotic and busy.  Waiter was nice enough about handling the allergic questions but overall didn't seem to be that helpful from the kitchen as they didn't get the short rib dish prepared correctly to isolate the dairy from the non-dairy parts as the waiter had promised.
for the money, I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bocce looks amazing and (like most of the Canadian restaurants I've been to) the servers are nice. I tried two pizzas: funghi ($22 CAD) and margherita ($16 CAD). I liked the crust but above the crust, not so much. The funghi was way too salty (I could only eat one piece). The margherita was just really boring: I wish the sauce had been more flavorful. The others I was with didn't seem to be as displeased as I was, but I noticed that they didn't eat much of their pizzas either (though they ate all the calamari and forno bread appetizers they ordered)

Parking was difficult and cabs aren't common but I'm told that's to be expected in this area."}
{"text":"Delicious high quality pizza. Ordered the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and pesto. Really delicious. Service was fast and professional. Some of my group had the brunch which is new. Italian toast is sweet and delicious on a flavorful panettone bread with blueberries."}
{"text":"Pizzas are amazing -- try to get a view of the kitchen so you can watch the dough slingers as they toss the dough around. Tip: order your beverages about an hour before going to the restaurant. We ordered two rounds of drinks (there were only two of us) and it took them forever to bring us the PPP and draught beer -- we basically had our drinks for dessert."}
{"text":"Mmmm, Bocce. I was thrilled when this place came to 4th Street because I live less than a block from this corner and a good restaurant there could make or break my evenings when I just don't want to cook! :)

I've been there a few times now and I can say that the food is DELISH. Everything we've had is amazing. The service was average and the prices were a bit too high for me (not for profit workers yay) so that's why it's only 4 stars, but if you have the dough and can check out Bocce, please do. YUM"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! This was my first time in Calgary, and the street it was on (is it called Restaurant Row?) was beyond precious. The restaurant itself was very nicely decorated, but we ended up seating outside to enjoy the fact that it wasn't 90 degrees like it is in Houston. I got the carbonara pasta and my friend got one of their pizzas- both were excellent. We also got the garlic bread (the $4 kind, not the $8 one with all the cheeses) and ordered some marinera sauce to dip it in and it was fantastic. Their hot chili oil is awesome on the garlic bread, pizza, and the pasta. Overall, I had a great experience here and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple times now.  Super casual Italian and great service. 

Absolutely love the wine list, and the food. Usually quite busy, but always moving so wait at the bar and try the red proseco. It was interesting!

We had the charcuterie which was a healthy portion. Lots of nuts and figs, prosciutto, salami, 3 cheeses.  Went great with the wine.  We also did the Ceasar  salad but with kale and it was a great idea.  

Gluten free pasta and pizzas here so my gf was all over that.  She had the mushroom tagliatelle. Really enjoyed it.  I did the spaghetti and meatballs one day and the chicken parm the other.  The chicken parm was awesome as you get salad with it too. 

Definitely a great spot in 4th. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not sure why people love this place. The food didn't feel quality and the wines were terrible. Got two different glasses and both were awful reds. We ordered the arancini balls and they came out room temp. Really?? The pizzas were equally disappointing. We ordered the arugula and prosciutto pizza and the calabrese. They looked and tasted like grocery store pizza. The olives on the calabrese pizza were insanely salty. And because of the reviews and pictures, we also ordered the carbonara. Nothing special about the dish at all. It was super creamy but it didn't taste restaurant quality. No thanks."}
{"text":"Confused about the ratings for this place. Maybe I visited on an off night. 

Street parking available around the area as is the case for visiting all the restaurants on 4th. 

We had the calamari, antipasti board, bolognese pasta, and the isola pizza, as well as the affogato for dessert. 

The calamari was great - big portion and calamari itself was tender and very tasty. The seasoning had something that made it a bit spicy. It's served with a lot of greens, it almost looks like a salad. 

The antipasti board was ok. It looked very impressive but I didn't think the cheeses or the meats were all that amazing. Our server didn't bother to explain to us about anything that was on the board. We just guessed what we were eating as we picked at it. 

The pizza was good but nothing amazing. I can't really recall what it tasted like other than that it was a bit on the salty side. 

The pasta looked great and was a huge portion. Literally a mountain of pasta! But this too, was also a bit on the salty side for me. 

I rarely drink anything other than water when I am dining but I had to opt for something fizzy to help with the salt and the greasiness. I also had to down water for the next 24 hours because I felt like I consumed way too much salt. 

Had the affogato for dessert which was the best part of the meal. The espresso was very strong and tasted really good with the vanilla ice cream. Would recommend!

I like the atmosphere of the place, I think it's very trendy and a loud (good kind of loud - lively!) restaurant but I don't know that I would go back for the food any time soon."}
{"text":"FaNtasTic.   I will recommend this place to anyone. 
It has a small menu but there is something for everyone.   They are a little heavy on the pork but as everything is made fresh I'm sure you can opt out. 
I had the mushroom pizza(regular Joe terms).  It was fresh and the pine nuts sent it to another level.  
Caesar salad, I'm not a fan but this one was as snappy as a well dressed man. 
Cheese bread teleported me to another dimension.
I will be back for seconds."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh pizza. The ice cream and cookies are good too. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their pizza is phenomenal! Chicken parma is good too. Service is pretty consistent with a nice ambience. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was down on 4th street and decided to get some take out. I used the online order system. Super easy. I got the chicken parm. It came with a salad (I upgraded to a Cesar salad for $2) and garlic bread which was honestly the size of a pizza with lots of garlic and parmesan. my order was ready on time, lots of friendly staff inside to help. Place looked immaculately clean. 

The food was good/average. The chicken was good but LOTS of breading. Cesar salad was great! 

I'd def go back and eat in. Looks like a cool place with great wine."}
{"text":"After seeing a lot of good reviews for Bocce I decided I had to try it. Located on restaurant row in Calgary's Mission District, Bocce definitely has a lot of stiff competition to deal with so I had high expectations going in. Upon entering you're hit with a bit of a heat wave as they unfortunately do not have air conditioning! I was definitely a bit surprised by this, not a place I'd want to be on a hot summer day, luckily we were there on mild summer evening during a cloudy/stormy week. 

The atmosphere feels bright, open and inviting with contemporary design and décor that makes the restaurant feel new and trendy. Right away we were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us at the bar since they were at capacity. The bartender promptly greeted us and provided us with water as well as a bottle for refills, I really wish more restaurants did the bottles at the table, big fan of this! Even though we had the bottle the bartender always seemed to beat us to it and did refills for us, I don't think our glasses were ever empty lol :). When it came to the food and drink menu he was extremely knowledgably and was able to confidently answer any questions we had. He even went as far as to discourage certain customization items when we thinking of ordering a pizza with a couple changes. I welcomed the suggestion and must say it is very rare to find a server in a restaurant who would be versed enough to make this kind of recommendation! In the end we both ordered salads with a pizza to share. I had the Italian Chop Chop which had a great combination of flavours. For most people this would be enough for a full meal but I was hungry which is why we had a pizza as well. My Fiancée had a side Caesar salad which was a good size, maybe a tad too garlicy though. For our pizza we had the Boschetto, I wouldn't have guessed pistachios work on pizza, but in this case they definitely did! Awesome gourmet style pizza, their crust is fantastic!

One thing I learned from the bartender is this restaurant is actually from the same group that brought us Mercato and Wurst. That makes three restaurants on 4th street for this group! Another cool thing about Bocce is they even do delivery. However check their delivery map online first as they only deliver to a restricted vicinity/zone. 

Very impressed by what Bocce has to offer, the food is fantastic, the service is some of the best I've had in Calgary and the prices are fair for a restaurant of this caliber. Biggest downfalls are the lack of A/C and limited parking in the area. You'll also have to pay for street parking during daytime hours."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere, be sure to make reso's"}
{"text":"checked out this new spot a few months back. here are the cole's notes:

1. super accomodating staff (especially when we needed to add a few more people + a baby to the party)
2. great gluten friendly pizza options
3. nice drink menu (alcoholic and non)
4. slick venue / great location
5. great pizza options

what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I strongly believe that there is no such a thing as too much pizza. So when I realized there is a new place opening up in my neighbourhood, it immediately became my mission to try it. 

This is a relatively big restaurant which makes it a perfect place for big groups. We went in a group of seven and were sited immediately. For drink we all got Peroni which they had it on tap.For food, we decided to stick to the pizza side of the menu and ordered 3 different types to share (Manzo, 4 cheese and Boschetto). The pizzas arrived fast and hot and they are definitely on the bigger side. 

All pizzas were crispy and thin crust which is the way I like it. But my favourite was the 4 cheese pizza with rosemary honey. the touch of sweetness was an excellent compliment to sharp taste of the cheese. Perfect harmony. The Manzo pizza was also very good but it is very spicy so be careful when ordering it. 

We also decided to try the cookies and gelato which to be fair it was underwhelming compared to other parts of the dinner. 

Overall, an excellent experience and for sure a big competition for other pizza joints in the neighbourhood. I cannot wait to go back there and try non pizza items on their menu. Also I realized they do delivery and their kitchen is open every night till 1 am !!!!!. So next time you are craving late night snack, you should definitely avoid the chains and either drop by their restaurant or simply call them."}
{"text":"This was the last meal that I had in Canada and it was delicious. I ordered a bucatini pescatore with a plate of mussels cooked in white wine sauce. Then chicken parmasean was delicious. Everything tasted great. I love the pasta that came with this dish bc it was hollow like a straw. All of the food were fresh even the mussels. I'm usually iffy about ordering mussels but this was awesome.  The food came out pretty soon after we ordered it. The ambiance was very clean with a lot of natural lighting. In so glad that I found this place on Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"Sister company to Wurst Uber Kitchen which is just down the street. I have really enjoyed all the pizza I have tried here, it's got that authentic smoky pizza oven taste."}
{"text":"If I'm going to give my first 5-star for a Calgary resto, this one may very well be it ;)

Great ambience, customer service, accurate pickup time, value and of course, the pizza, wow---one of my top 5 for neapolitan-style.

Ordered the Isola pizza: italian ham, mozzarella, smoked scamorza (another type of moz), so plenty of cheese for sure.  But the highlight? the pancetta---Italian form of bacon spiced w/ black pepper, with rosemary oil, and there you have a pizza made from heaven ;)

another bonus is the soft crust, even after taking out, 15 min-drive, the bread didn't disappoint.  Still baked it for a few easy minutes, and watched my own hometown Canucks getting crushed, what a fantastic way to celebrate a Sat nite!

From personal experience, I can vouch for their marketing---these guys have it altogether.  It's an action-packed vibe, look at all their green take out boxes; plus orange and green are rated as positive feelings.  

In the back section, seems to be more of a casual setting, though even the left side, a bit more formal and facing the main road, with those high loft glass walls, really make this a date night too.

Amex ;)"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's not pretentious at all and puts you at ease from the moment you walk in.  

A great place to catch up with old friends or even a date.  Which is exactly how it should be.

To me, judging pizzas is like judging a burger. Everyone has their own style and preference, but I gotta say though, Bocce is pretty darn good. 

The best?  Probably not, but the pizzas are reasonably priced, service is top notch and love the ambience inside this place. The floor to ceiling windows, beautiful wooden tables, clean washrooms (always a plus).  

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The food was also excellent.  We had the sausage and peppers along with the mussels to start.  My wife had the spaghetti bolognese, I had the chicken Parmesan. Both were very good.  Most other customers were having pizza,we'll try that next time. 

Overall awesome, we'll be there again for the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Bocce in about a year and something has changed.. for the better! The pizza crust was crispy and cracker thin with amazing flavours on the toppings and sauce. I highly recommend the warm olives and kale salad, both are fantastic and bursting with flavour. Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"The food was decent (I requested a slight modification of a dish, they were able to accomodate that to some extent, but lacked the logic to think it through:  to wit, \"no oil please\" was served with olives).  

The service was excellent, and I particularly liked the fact the people working there weren't perkly little blondes wearing short black tight and revealing dresses:  normal people doing good work.

The place?  Too loud!  I mentioned it upon arrival, the hostess turned it down a bit, but the music volume kept increasing by increments as the evening wore on.  Getting together with friends over dinner shouldn't have to mean hollering; that's for night clubs."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!  There were three of us and we ordered the antipasti board, tallegio salad, pascolo and melazana pizzas.  The food was extremely impressive, however I wish the server would have advised that we had ordered too much, instead he told us to order additional side of bread. Waaaay too much food for three people.  Otherwise the food was delicious and the post card with the bill was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This cute little Italian place is a great spot in the Mission district. The environment is really warm and inviting. I can here with my cousin and friend after a movie and we were looking for lighter fare. Together we ordered the tallegio friti (fried cheese salad) and the quattro formaggi pizza. The salad was excellent hitting flavour notes with the aroma of the truffle vinaigrette, the bitterness of the arugula, the earthiness of the mushroom crudo, and the sweetness of the honey. The pizza was equally delicious as well. There is balance between the cheese in saltiness and  pungent flavours that pairs well with the sweetness of honey. We added chilli oil to the pizza and it was an amazing combination. One of our party members was also able to indulge in the pizza with the gluten free crust option. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!.. The pizzas are delicious!.. And the ambience is very cool... The cocktails were good as well.. This restaurant has a good location, and the service is very friendly... I definitely will go back there for some pizzas and wine in a cool place!..."}
{"text":"This place has friendly and professional staff. They are busy on weekends, so remember to book in advance, or you'll have to sit at the bar. Also, it is a bit loud inside.

The food is nicely arranged and looks delicious. I had the calamari and the four cheese pizza, and I must say that the taste was not the best part of my experience. I did not like my food."}
{"text":"OK pizzas. The two pizzas we got were heavy on the salt, and nothing speial. The pasta was ok, again lots of salt.  It's a decent restaurant at a nice location, so its not a bad place to meet up with friends. The service was also good."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza .. We had the fungi pizza and the kale/arugula salad with white truffle oil. Flavors and quality of food as well as presentation deserves 5 stars!! Also great decor .. Check out the lighting. We were in town from Vancouver and will definitely return on next visit to YYC."}
{"text":"I sent my parents here for their anniversary dinner and they had a fantastic time. My mum texted me after they finished to say the meal was delicious. When they got home (they're from out of town),  my dad couldn't have raved more than he did. Now, my parents can be hard to please when it comes to eating dinner out, so when they come home and are excited by their meal, you know it had to have been good! They were very impressed by the service and the food was just as impressive. They said they will definitely go back next time they're in town in September! Nice work team!"}
{"text":"Formaggi pizza is to die for! Crust is light and fluffy, and the combination of cheeses are perfect. Also had the tortellini, delicious. Cute ambiance. Will come again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food.   I love the antipasti platter with forno bread.   The staff is super friendly and accommodating.   I have only ever ordered take out, but hope to come for dinner soon.    Last time I went I was treated to a cappuccino while I waited for my order.   So fantastic!   Love this place!"}
