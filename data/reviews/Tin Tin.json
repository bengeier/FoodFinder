{"text":"heard great things about tin tin, so we went for dinner on a Wednesday night. other than the crabs, didn't feel like it was anything special. just another Chinese buffet with a few unique dishes. I felt like they had other items, but no signs or descriptions on how to order from the lady behind the counter. stood there for a minute to see if someone would ask me what I wanted, but that didn't happen either so I decided to skip it. overall experience was not bad, but will not be going back."}
{"text":"I thought this place closed down, but it was only temporary. Needless to say, their food didn't improve with the reopening and it's still way too overpriced ($25 per person). I normally hate buffets anyway and this one was no exception. I used to go here when I was a little kid, but now I'm never gonna go back here ever again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it definitely changed. There used to be \"All You Can Eat Crab Legs\" and they took that off. That sucks. They also had some great garlic crawfish and now it's as if they stopped making it taste good. I usually have their raw oysters and that's the only good thing right now. The raw fish sashimi were dry in the corners and I was soooo disappointed. What happened to the old Tin Tin?"}
{"text":"Tremendous selection, absolutely huge. Not much here thats any good at all. I've tried it several times and its been consistantly disappointing. For my tastes, they should cut out about half of the selections and concentrate on making the ones they keep taste better. Hint: when someone gives it 5 stars and talks about their good salads and soups, don't value their opinion about the chinese food ! The food isn't that good, and it costs too much."}
{"text":"Poor service, food is not tasty at all and they don't have verity of chicken. Plus, they have signs at every table which says \" don't waste food, take only what you think you will eat.\" Be aware!"}
{"text":"Over priced at $21.99 per person.  Food is gross . . . extremely noisy . . .kids running around like it is a playground.  I will never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"My son and I went here today and it was pretty good.  However, we were a little disappointed that they didn't have any crab legs.  We actually wanted to go to Joe's Crab Shack but realized when we got there that they had closed down.  :)  Not sure when that happened, but we were sure looking forward to some crab legs.  Oh well...the buffet was good too....just really wanted some crab!!"}
{"text":"Coming from the bay area, home to numerous sources of amazing Chinese food (even amazing pan-Asian buffet food, which is almost an oxymoron), I don't expect to be finding much in the way of Chinese food where there are relatively few Chinese. When you're this far from home, the taste buds develop their sea legs, and you start to be able to nod intelligently when people argue about the best ways to cook a pig. But for a taste of home, the heart wants what it wants. Lucky us, a local fan recommended Tin Tin.  We came, we saw, we ate. Some things rocked, like the kid-approved gyoza-like potstickers, black bean spareribs, and the custom-made noodle soups. I loved the Chinese-style fried chicken, reminiscent of many a Chinatown quick eat. Some things were not so great, like the oversteamed dim sum, soggy salad bar, and tired dessert counter. But it was a great spread and value. Kids under 10 eat at such an amazing price, too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tin Tin already has 17 reviews and I am usually one for trying to steer from writing a review of the places I have been while also agreeing with the majority of reviews.  Meaning, Tin Tin is already well known and very exposed with good press.  Not to mention I'm not a fan of buffets in general but a Chinese buffet with this much variety *unless you're a veggie head ;) was an exception for me. Plus after my last Chinese review I thought I would chime in.   We have never had to wait on our visits during dinner hours but it is always busy. For the price I think it is well worth it.   Crab Legs, peel and eat Shrimp, Oysters, Mussels. Sounds more like a seafood buffet right?  What? YOU EAT OYSTERS FROM A BUFFET? Yep! And as many as I want!   We probably have sampled it all -oink oink- (not in one visit) and it is all really tasty. Like Bill F- I gotta agree - their fried dumplings or pork filled stickers are always hot and fresh and perfect. And the dipping sauce is great! These are always a first plate for me!  I love string beans from a Chinese restaurant and I am the one you are waiting in line behind while I pick them out one by one of the chaffing dish because I only want the string beans from that certain dish. Please except my apology.   While I did say I was not a fan of buffets in general, for instance, I believe the words Italian and buffet should never be used together *sacrilege* I would also make an exception for a dessert buffet :) and ironically, Tin Tin offers a few desserts on their buffet  BUT I can do with out all of them.  Isn't ironic, don'tcha think? alittle tooooooo ironic...sing it!   Well, I always have room for their ice cream and a fortune cookie.  Bottom line, I have tried a number of Chinese restaurants here in Charlotte but not many Chinese Buffets  so take my five star review for what you will."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Charlotte we were in seventh heaven with this restaurant.  I understand at some point it's come under new management.  They still have good food but it's just not up to the standard or quality of food that they used to have. I'll still eat LUNCH here if in the area. But I will no longer go out of my way to come over here like I used to. The price has also gotten too high for what they're offering, $25 nights and weekends just to include crab legs and a couple of other items . This is my last out of the way trip. Personally I think price is what is killing the once packed restaurant.  Again, still good food but I'd recommend lunch over dinner time. Price and food quality has gone down is only reason I gave it 3 stars. Delicious but just not delicious enough."}
{"text":"Upscale and different Asian buffet. Maybe not for the kids ?? Food was fresh, hot and delicious ! We'll be back !"}
{"text":"Though a little more expensive than most Chinese buffets, this place is worth it.  The service is always great, and the selection and quality of food is amazing.  They have traditional Chinese dishes and some tamer fare as well.  Great selection of sushi too."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since my husband is trying to find an authentic Asian buffet in Charlotte. I noticed crumbs of food on the floor right away. The carpets and tile floors have a \"yuck\" factor. My table had a film on it. My husband tried the salmon and said it was okay. I noticed he didn't go back for seconds. I tried several different vegetables dishes. The vegetables were wilted and had a sour taste. I tried some cold meat dishes but wasn't impressed. My poor husband was eating all the subpar food because there are signs posted on the wall at each table that you will be charged for any leftovers on your plate. I also couldn't notice all the food encrusted around the sign.  I ended up eating three bowls of freshly prepared soup (spicy coconut) which was out of this world! The buffet did nothing for me. My husband said he enjoyed the fried chicken but nothing else off the bar."}
{"text":"Too bad this place has closed!  Went last week and there was a chain on the door."}
{"text":"Disgusting , overpriced , don't waste your money and your time . Especially Who introduced the duck was rude, it's a buffet ppl !  and they have one piece policy !! , how is that ? I don't know why ppl go there to waste their money !!"}
{"text":"I usted to love this place, but since the re-opening     They have removed the grill and they no longer have wonton soup nor the curry soup. The fried dumplings have a thicker dough than before and the sauce was salty. They provide more options for noodle soups but I missed the wontons.  I don't eat crab legs and dinner was pricey. The ice cream machine was out of order also. They remodeled but they still don't have a baby changing station in the bathroom either. I was very disappointed after being a very loyal Tin Tin lover for the last 7 years.... Oh well"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. Sanitation grade is a 90. Overpriced for the quality. It costs $67 dollars from me and my two young children to eat there. I will not make that mistake again . I will not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can think of three better buffet place then Tin Tin right off the bat! My parents love Tin Tin for the crab legs so we always end up going here when we're doing a family outing.  Today was Father's Day so we went there since it was my dad's choice. Going there reminded me there's nothing I like about Tin Tin except for their interior design of the place.  Everything at Tin Tin is way too salty! I think this is probably their secret method to get you full quick with all that salt intake.   They have a lot of variety, but nothing that stands out. All I taste is salt! Their sesame chicken taste like they put way too much pineapple juice in there. Butter shrimp is way too salty.   I love lo mein and their lo mein today was just basically noodles and grease. No flavor beyond that whatsoever!  They do not have a good sushi variety either. Fruits are never fresh, ice cream is blah... and way overprice!  **PS, I'm not sterotyping, but I am Asian and I know what good asian food taste like. So my reviews are very honest in terms of quality and taste of food. ** :)"}
{"text":"Heard they reopened today and went there. It was a mess. Food was not as good as it used to be and the sea food didn't seem to be fresh. They have less selection now and no longer have the roasted duck. The ice cream machine was out of order - on their first day of opening.... Yet the price was the same as before. It's $50+ for two of us! This is definitely overpriced and you can easily find other places with $10+ and way better selection and quality of food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of food and a decent selection of some more traditional Asian dishes for the adventurous American eater. Their sushi is bland and their quality can vary wildly, but their selection and quality of buffet food at good turnaround times makes up for it. Overall my experiences have been positive for the price."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and have even recommended friends to come here but never again. Going there I was aware that they discontinued all you can eat crab legs. As soon as we walked in the door the greeter (possible owner) said \"We no longer serve crab legs at the bar\". Which made my husband feel like it was racial because he was pretty sure he didn't notice him saying that to all the customers walking in. Anyways we were seated and grabbed our food which was a bad idea. The quality of the food was terrible. The food was dry and not well prepared. The food and even sushi was dry and tasted like it had been out for a long time. We sat there just to see if we saw any workers bringing out new food and we didn't at all. After one plate of barely ate food we got up and left and didn't wait for the non-waiter to bring our ticket. We walked right up to the cashier and paid and explained we have to leave immediately because of the poor quality. We could have gotten better food at our local Chinese takeout spot. I really wish I wasn't writing this review because I truly used to love this place and now I'm extremely disappointed. Never again."}
{"text":"I first went to Tin Tin three years ago and was pleasantly surprised to find a large selection of dishes that you don't find in the usual Americanized Chinese places.  The large number of Asian customers was also encouraging.  Because we live on the other side of town, we have only been a couple of times for lunch.  Unfortunately, our recent experience was not as good.  We went for dinner on Saturday night.  They were very busy, but we only had to wait a few minutes for a table.  The first thing I noticed was that the place was filthy.  The floor was trashed, and there was spilt food and liquids behind a bus cart.  The buffet area was cleaner, but overall I just got a feeling of *ick* about the whole place, like it just needs a good hosing down with a power sprayer.  This probably colored my opinion of the food, but I just felt it was not as good as it had been in the past.  As for service, the dirty plates on our table were not collected in a timely fashion, nor was our water refilled.   If you are looking to try Tin Tin, I strongly suggest going for the cheaper option of lunch, and the possibility of having a cleaner experience when they're not so busy."}
{"text":"Ok place,  food gets cold between lunch and dinner. Overpriced"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero. Fish was old food was dry and definitely not sanitary. They also had odor bombs under the seats...nasty.   DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"Wow...HOW DREADFUL.  Just went here for dinner, and since it was packed, didn't bother to look around before deciding to dine.   Besides the copious amount of snow crab legs...the food is greasy, under seasoned and overall fast-food. You can easily tell the fried items are deep fried in oil that hasn't been changed in a long time.  The dim sum is obviously frozen and re-heated.   Why do I know these things?  I used to live in Chinatown in Boston, and if you want good Asian food (Americanized or not) you will not find it here.   BUT: The reason this restaurant has 2 stars from me...only because I know there are gluttons out there who will *adore* shoving their faces with sub-par food, because they can get their money's worth.  I wish I had my $19.99 back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and Nasty. .. Won't go back.. They charge you extra  if you don't eat all the food on your plate... Cheap with the salad dressing. .. They put it on for you...."}
{"text":"Let me clarify as too why only 3 stars.  The restaurant itself is very nice in appearance and the variety of food is excellent. The main things that stand out: Customer service, cleanliness and pricing.   Most of the staff doesn't speak English well making it hard to understand them. Every time I needed a refill I had to look for our waitress and wave her down. As far as plates being removed from our table not a problem except one time i wasn't done with my plate and she came by and picked it up without even asking if i was finished or not.   Cleanliness is a big thing for me. My gf likes to say that I'm just a tad bit ocd but I assure you Im not! Lol I simply expect things a certain way.  I definitely dont want to look down and see the food that the people before us were eating. As I walked around the buffet too serve me some food and i would look down and see pieces of food and other small trash around.   The pricing is mainly high because of the \"all you can eat crablegs\" Now the first time I ever came here it was 19$ and now its 23.50 for one dinner buffet. So for me and my gf our total was 53$. Not exactly the average buffet price other places have. I feel that they should have a lower price for people who opt out of the crab legs.   All in all i will definitely be returning and recommending to others."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and for starters the food taste horrible I could get better tasting food at the mall for half the price they try to charge here, it was cold the rice tasted old and overcooked the noodles were dry the sesame chicken tasted old I mean just plain out bad and then when I requested to speak to the manager his excuse was its a buffet the food doesn't have to be hot what the heck is that ?! After that he said I had to pay full price and proceeded to be rude about it like it was my fault I ate one plate and not even all of it yet he still insisted I pay full price I told him I would not pay for food that tasted that bad finally he decided to charge 50% only after I insisted I wouldn't pay he's lucky he even got $4.75 out of me because the service from him was horrible and the food was not any better than his attitude I advise people to STAY AWAY !! Go anywhere but here !!!"}
{"text":"When a friend and I walked in at 8:45pm one of the first things we were told was that they close at 9:30pm. That should have been the sign for us to turn around and find another place but we didn't. While the staff was cleaning up all around us we went to the buffet. I did eat my share of sushi (rice so hard it was obvious it had been out for awhile or improperly cooked). Mediocre food at best. When the bill came and it was $54!!! I was stunned. We could have gone to any other restaurant in the area, been treated like welcomed customers and had much better food for less money. Needless to say I will NEVER pass through their doors again."}
{"text":"Been here twice service was cordial menu was fine although more room for variety could be applied."}
{"text":"The crabs where great!  That is the only reason we go.   The sushi looks really good but I am not a fan of sushi.   The food on the buffet is not that great.   Thus I focus on the crab legs only."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see so many negative reviews about Tin Tin recently! I enjoyed my visit there yesterday just as I always do. The key about this buffet is to stick with the \"Big Ticket\" items such as: the crab legs (so good!), the peel and eat shrimp, the  steamed crawfish, the epic steamed buns, and oh so good peking duck! If you are going to spend $22 for a dinner buffet why would you even touch the almost always generic americanized chinese food?? Get your moneys worth and stick to the \"Big Ticket\" items! No matter what time you arrive be prepared to wait at least 20 - 30 mintues. The crab legs and other highly sought after items are only offered at the dinner service."}
{"text":"I love the soup here!  I would go here just for that! Beyond the soup, it is definitely one of the better buffet's in Charlotte.  A little on the pricey side but well worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday lunch with my family and I've got to say worst Chinese buffet I've ever been too!!!! Bad food, bad service, even the tea was nasty... Just do yourself a favor and avoid this place..."}
{"text":"No more \"all you can eat\" crab legs at this restaurant!  They really need to take it off their website since it isn't offered anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!   Plus they need to get that low 90 restaurant score up, too!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Gross!  We left & ended up taking our family to The Melting Pot.    45 minute drive each way.  We will NEVER go back, or refer this place!!!  Hmmm...  No wonder their parking lot was SO empty..."}
{"text":"I visited them Saturday. Health score is 81. Really, 2 points lower and you're closed. I have enjoyed eating there in the past but I do not want food poisoning so I'll try them again in a few months and if the health score is above 90."}
{"text":"Very disappointing on their first reopening day. The food doesn't seem to be freshed and they have less options than before. Plus, they removed the grill bar and roasted duck. The ice cream maker is out of order as well. What doesn't change there is the price. $25 ppl after tax. I asked the waitress what's going on and she asked me to talk to their boss. Their boss said yes and that's what you gonna pay for. LOL. Never going back to this place again..."}
{"text":"The sushi was not fresh.  Very pale, milky colored, like frozen fish.  I saw vacuum sealed packs of salmon behind the counter.  The crab legs were so over cooked, I couldn't even eat them.  The meat just disintegrated when you try to get it out.  The dump some was pretty good.  And very good beef with peppers and onions.  The chow fun was passable.  All in all not worth anywhere near the $21.00 price."}
{"text":"I used to live in Los Angeles, CA and they have alot of delicious Asian restaurant. I have noticed that in North Carolina there are many Chinese/ Asian buffet, but this restaurant was the first one I found with whole lot of quality foods.  The dinner and lunch menu are great and on the weekends they get really busy. Also the service is alot better than the ones that I have experienced in North Carolina.  If you have the hots for Asian food Chinese, Korean, Japanese food I give the two thumbs up for this place!  If you have tasted good Asian food from other states, if you are in North Carolina this is one recommendable place for a bite."}
{"text":"I love this place ,I specially love the soup station the steamed fish and a variety of steam veggies. Why did it closed, someone told me renovation."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese food and found out quickly this is not the place. I don't have one good thing to say about my visit.  The first booth they sat me in had 4 flies hanging out so I requested to be moved.  The steamed rice, fried rice, chicken and steak on the buffet was cold. Then I tried the soup which had no taste.  I also tried to season myself with salt and pepper to no avail.  Last, I was about to try the Chinese dumpling near the soup when I saw the worker pull them out of a pre-packaged bag.  Goodness!  I paid 25 for two buffets that NOONE could eat and got a upset stomach. :("}
{"text":"People, your positive reviews are killing me. Because clearly Tin Tin is a slop house. Don't bother selling me the mile-long buffet options, because if the most appetizing thing you can find is jello cubes, then you're not selling me anything but a smoke-and-mirrors game.  I'd eaten here before, a few years back. I was getting some car work done at the nearby Griffin Brothers shop (another place to avoid; another review for another time), and had some time to kill while the grease monkeys were pretending to know how to do a 37-point inspection. I'd heard about how awesome Tin Tin's buffet was, so I gave it a whirl.   Bad choice. Pretty sub-standard far, as far as I was concerned. The sesame chicken is drowned in some kind of gooey mystery sauce. Their noodles were criminally salty. As for the sushi...I think I've seen better sushi at a Hardee's. And Hardee's doesn't make sushi. Honestly, I sampled nothing worth a damn here. Yuck. Never again will I step foot in here.  So fast forward about 5 years later. I'm working relatively nearby, and I had a rare opportunity to take a long (read: more than 30 minutes) lunch. One of my colleagues kept saying how much he loves dining at Tin Tin. He told me it had gotten better since I last ate here. But I was jonesing for some Chinese, but didn't feel like going to Wan Fu, since I'd been eating there a lot lately, and I didn't want to get burned out.  I should have trusted my instincts. Tin Tin was WORSE than ever. I was there less than 15 minutes, no joke.  Also, wanna irk the shit out of me, hostess? When I ask to be seated somewhere that doesn't feel as if I'm being exiled to the back of the restaurant for some culinary crime I committed in the past, don't roll your eyes at me. That should have been my cue to get the hell out of there. Stupid me for not listening to my instincts...again.  Tin Tin shouldn't ever be recommended to anyone by anyone, unless you clearly despise that person and wish all kinds of evil upon them. And even then, recommending Tin Tin would be the worst kind of cruel and unusual punishment.  What a dump."}
{"text":"Gross... not impressed. The cost with crab legs is $29.99. The crab legs have no seasoning. The rest of the chinese food was bland. Never again.."}
{"text":"Since I can't leave less than one star tin tin gets one. The food here is truly disgusting, cold, slimy, and flavorless. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Just joined a great partner at TIN TIN for buffet.  Nice 15 minute trip from downtown Charlotte to the south side.  Great welcome at the door....fast seating....and quickly took the tour of the massive buffet.  Without the tour....I may have missed the dessert bar tucked away near the back corner. First Plate....appetizers, salad and sushi,, tofu.....all good stuff....all very fresh and tasty. Second Plate...seafood, spring rolls, onion rings, shrimp lo mein, butter shrimp, mussels, clams and a chicken wing......oh so good....and not feeling full yet!   Third Plate...Satay chicken, mushrooms and tofu, sweet and sour chicken, peel and eat shrimp, walked past the chicken feet...added some eggrolls...and some delicious red chili paste!!  OK....I have a big appetite! Fourth Plate.....my Veggie plate....with fried rice, green beans, bok choi and wondering...who the heck is gonna drive me back to work???  OK finished it all....and had a nice dumpling to top it off.   Now....back to that dessert bar....OK....plenty of desserts....but I can only eat so much more..... how about a coconut macaroon, a butter cookie complete with almond...and this sesame coated ball filled with gooey sweet stuff.  Alright....ate that...drank my very sweet tea...and called it a day!  Did the waitress just ask me if I needed a NAP????  Thank you partner.....what a treat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    zzzzzzzzzzzzz!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Tin Tin for almost 15 years.  In the beginning it's long-time owners did a really good job of serving some of the better Asian food in the Charlotte area.  Then a few years ago, it was taken over by new owners who were not Asian and the food and the restaurant itself really suffered.  Just a few months ago it was taken over by new owners, who did a much-needed remodel.  The restaurant is now sparkling clean, the servers are very friendly and attentive, and I found the manager to be at the top of his game, with frequent table-touches and ensuring engagement with customers as they arrive and depart.  As for the food:  I've read so many reviews slamming the sushi.  To these people I say, you're eating sushi at a more-or-less Chinese buffet.  Please adjust your expectations accordingly.  The rest of the dishes are definitely house-made, and while not always 100% authentic, they are still very delicious.  Please give Tin Tin another chance; you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We went on July-10-2015. We were very pleased with the quality of the food.The shell oysters,crab legs,shrimp and sushi are absolutely delicious.The wait staff were friendly and attentive. The price $ 25 bucks per person is fair compared to the amount of choices.Two things that stood out that I liked, was they keep your tea filled and they bring the check after you eat and not during the meal. So me and the better half recommend Tin Tin and suggest you go there hungry and you will be pleased. THE FOOD DUDE.    : )"}
{"text":"2 things. 1. dim sum 2. beef chow fun. nuff said.  greenville to charlotte is only 1.5 hour drive.  any time we have family or friends flying for a visit, we make it a priority for them to land at clt for 2 reasons. 1. jamba juice @ the airport, and 2. tin tin's.  it really is middle of nowhere. but it is somewhat close to the south park mall.  the food is really good. everything is really good. i wish they had larger selection of sushi/rolls, but their dim sums and beef chow funs really make up for it.  their service is friendly, it can get crowded so get there early. bathroom is clean (which is a must), and though i've never been to their dinner, my family said it's worth it.  im getting hungry just thinking about it. yum-O"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese buffets I have ever eaten at. There may be room for improvement, however the food is very fresh, and the crab legs are quite good. The variety is the largest I have seen when you take into account the three chefs preparing noodles, soups, and meat right before your eyes. When I go to Chinese buffets I usually try the same items such as sesame chicken, and crab ragoons. These items were far and away better than what I have found at other buffets. The buffet is a bit pricey for dinner at $20 for one adult, however you get what you pay for and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco and I think this is the best Asian buffet I've been to. The food here was really good, service was friendly, and so much to choose from. What pleases me most is that my tummy feels fine afterwards. I like the noodle soups they have, egg rolls and crab legs. The tapioca dessert was good and sushi was pretty decent.   I was very impressed when I dined here the 1st time and liked it equally the 2nd and 3rd times. They do a good job handling large groups. Can't wait to go here again when I'm visiting relatives in Charlotte. My whole family thinks it's better than the buffets they frequent in San Jose, CA...I don't dine at buffets a lot but would if more were like Tin Tin!"}
{"text":"Was once my favorite restaurant. I didn't mind much they took off the all you eat crab legs. However charging 14$ per lb is overpriced. They use to have a lot of variety hot food, this time they cut down the price but also their varieties. Food was like any Chinese buffet now, bland and cold. I use to drive 1hour 30 for it, now i'll just stay at my local buffet."}
{"text":"NOT THE SAME OWNER....this is a far cry from what it used to be.  The once hottest spot for Chinese food which I've driven 1.5 hrs for is no longer the same. This is now just the same-same run of the mill buffet.  The new owners isn't doing anything wrong if they would changed the name entirely. Keeping the same name sets customers up for major disappointments."}
{"text":"This place use to have a large variety of delicious food, but it seems it has lost its touch. I believe the only thing good here is the soup and the clams. Their sushi bar is basically nonexistent as they never refilled it. Would not recommend overall as there are much better choices in the area for the same cost."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it's not like it use to be. Went here for dinner thinking it would be better than lunch, but the only thing I noticed differently were the raw oysters. The food isn't warm, their bbq pork buns were old and cold, shrimp and squid was tough, most of the food is cold, and a worse sushi selection. They do have delicious taro  buns and their custom soup is good. They don't do takeout by the box anymore, it's per pound. They do have an early bird special. From 4:30-5:30 Mon-Thurs it's $10.50/person. I know I'll be back but would not go for dinner since it's not worth the price. I'd only go for lunch or early birth special since I like the variety"}
{"text":"$24.95 is an outrageous price for a buffet. I guess if you like crab legs and are planning to stuff yourself with them until you breathe crab, but for those of us who are going with someone but dont eat seafood, its just way too high. You can go to Tokyo grill and get 2 adults to eat for $22.50, and a small child, there's plenty of seafood there and a hibachi and the food is always good. They just dont have crab legs. So ask yourself how much are crab legs worth to you?"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best Chinese buffet in Charlotte.  But now it is one of the worst.  Terrible, cold, bland and not too many things to eat. Expensive by the way compare with other Chinese buffet. Simple terrible."}
{"text":"not that good. the food is very watered down the hot and sour soup taste like water and there was a smell that can't be described. some of the food was ok but I could not recommend this to anyone. we ordered unsweet tea and when we got it it was bad. it tasted like a dirty sock. sorry if you like Chinese food you will need to go elsewhere. the gas station serves better than this place."}
{"text":"Had heard about this place many times from friends and family and was driving by and thought I would try it. Food is very different but good. Some is cold and some is warm but it's a buffet and whenever you go to a buffet there is always a cold food. Staff was very friendly kept coming to refill my water and take my plate away.  There is a spot where you can make your own soup. You tell the person what kind of noodles you want and what kind of meat and veggies. About 23 dollars for two on the weekend for lunch which isn't bad. They have a Chinese bread there that is to die for. Wasn't sure if we could get it due to them getting ready for dinner but we were able to and my heart melted with this bread. It has strawberry syrup on it and powered sugar. There was also Carmel syrup and chocolate syrup on some with sprinkles. They had the authentic Chinese style foods which you don't find at to many places and it's very interesting to try these foods. Sushi was delicious. Many types to chose from and even had some I have never seen."}
{"text":"I am glad I read the latest reviews. We were going to bring a crowd of 16 hungry adults to celebrate combined birthdays. After learning that Tin Tin no longer serves 'all you can eat' crab legs in the buffet price, no thank you.   If you are the proprietor reading this and understand enough written English....  Sad choice you made. We have witnessed the same decision made by two other restaurants in the Asheville NC area. They have since closed and sold. Their demise was slow and painful. Watching their customer base slowly disappear must have been painful. But that is their dagger in their own back.   Lesson learned for restaurant owners:  Once you have reached a high point on your menu items, never back down or reduce. It is suicide.   Sorry Tin Tin, you were once great, like the Great Wall of China. But, like the Great Wall, it no longer serves a purpose."}
{"text":"I loved TIN TIN. I've been a returning customer for past 12 years, their CRAB LEGS always got me back.   They don't have CRABS no more.  Lowered the buffet price to $13.99 but NO CRABS.  I had to order crab legs separately at $14.99 per pound.  And I ordered 5 lbs of crab legs for the table of 6 people but it was ridiculously small portion, it was about the amount I used to get for myself alone!!!!!! 1/21/17 I saw many customers come in and leave because of the crab legs.  I will not return until they change this."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of buffets myself but we go to tin tin on a regular basis specifically for the crab legs. The great thing about tin tin is that they realize that people go there just for the crab and they keep two hotel pans full of crab at all times. Most other buffet's that have crab legs really slack on getting them out. Needless to say tin tin is worth the cost. Some of there other items on the buffet are pretty good as well. they always have an array of decent sushi, roasted duck, oysters on the half shell, coctail shrimp, crawfish, mussells as well as all your regular chinese buffet items."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets, but this place isn't bad. They have HUGE selection. Also, for those of you who are looking for dim sum in Charlotte area, this may be the best you are going to get. They do have a reasonable number of dim sum items on the buffet line (at least they did on the day I went). Lunch is reasonably priced at less than 10 bucks. I think dinner is a bit pricier though. Be hungry when you go because there's so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese place I've ever been to.  The sushi was gross the rice tasted like glue and if you didn't eat all your food it would cost you extra. On top of that it's $20 for an adult and and builders considered 10 and over.  For your sake do not go here"}
{"text":"We will not be going back. Their biggest appeal were the crab legs which are NO LONGER on the menu. They are now promoting a budget friendly menu for $14 and the many food choices can only be defined as random. There are so many options that many of the food items (lo mein) are not kept in food heaters but in plates under the lights. There are few Chinese buffet food stables (i.e. general tso chicken, bourbon chicken to name a few). The food that was in the heaters were not hot/fresh. Not worth it and won't be back."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Charlotte almost 12 years ago, we told friends that we have found the best asian buffet. As of 3 years ago, we told friends that it's okay, but now what it used to be. Recently we went to Tin Tin only to find they were closed. I thought \"That's a good thing\" since in my opinion they were going down hill. I was told the owners just picked up and left. Then I heard they were redoing the place..and sure enough, they reopened. We were anxious to return. In my opinion... they should have stayed closed.  While the soups were ok, a lot of the food like squid was barely cooked. The names of the various dishes were barely written on the glass. The ice cream just dripped out of the machine like ...well use your imagination.   The cookies and other pastries  were just terrible...some under baked and others over baked I think their time has come and gone. I will not return. Charlotte has better to offer."}
{"text":"Could not give you any lower this was the most horrible food that I've ever ate two hours after I left there I am still sick it was disgusting when I complain to the manager there was very little empathy I even go I told him that I was sick it has been a bathroom visit for a long-term care I wouldn't not recommend did anybody it's there"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food selection and usually when I visit is about 30 min to 1 hr from the time of opening so I get to try the freshest dishes. Also the cooks continuously come by to replenish the buffet. Staff is very friendly and since I'm a regular they stop by to say hello."}
{"text":"I am from Boston and recently moved to South Carolina.  This is my second taste of Chinese food in The South.  I would definitely say this place is worth trying.  The sushi is fresh and tastes about as good as the kind that you would find in a supermarket (Shaws for those from the Boston area).  The hot & sour soup was very good and the choice of quality entree items was immense.  They have everything from smiley face french fries to frog legs.  I will definitely be making more trips to this place.  Please note that dinner is 2x as much as lunch and starts at 4:30pm."}
{"text":"Tin Tin has become somewhat of a buffet staple in Charlotte. I would definitely recommend reading this review if it's your first time or if you're deciding whether or not it is worth the try. My family and friends have been coming here for years. Let me clarify one essential fragment that completes the full substance that is Tin Tin; this is a \"seafood\" buffet with a seafood price tag. It is now around $25 per person for dinner. If your focus is on standard Americanized Chinese food (sweet and sour this and sesame that), Tin Tin is not for you. 90% of the locals that come here are on a hunt for lobster, snow crab, oyster, crawfish and clams. They do a good job of refilling the lobster that barely lasts 10 minutes upon arrival. Be prepared to wrestle a seemingly sweet little lady for that lobster. Last time, I stood and waited as FIVE different spoons and clamps dug in the lobster dish for \"the good stuff.\" I, the nice and patient one, was left with sauce and claws. Don't worry, I lucked out on the second batch. I understand the brawl because the lobster is definitely where the gold is! Take notes, this is valuable information. All in all, this is not really a seafood buffet, but you can't opt out of the seafood that is on the buffet bar or for the commotion that fresh lobster brings. Good luck!"}
{"text":"It's a bit more expensive than some other competing Chinese buffets, but still a hella lot cheaper than anything I can get in New York, so I have no issues.  There's a decent selection and they at least have some sushi and korean food options.  I also like that they have a station to make your own soup with whatever you want in it.  Other than that, everything else is run-of-the-mill chinese food.  I wish they would turn over the fish dishes a little more often so they wouldn't be so overcooked, but it's still edible.  I could tell that they were itching for me and my family to hurry up so they could turn the table over, but I didn't see anyone waiting and there were plenty of other open tables, so I didn't mind taking my time to get my money's worth.  I'd go back if I had to, but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way."}
{"text":"They don't have much of a selection. I'm disappointed I have to spend so much money on this wack dinner. The only good thing this place has is their crab legs.  I asked the so called sushi chef to make me eel on a bed of rice and him and another person said they don't do that. In my opinion this place is a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The best time to go is also the worst time to go--during Chinese New Year.  They have special dishes just for the occasion, and it's also when their crab legs are the freshest.  The place is usually PACKED and we've waited more than two hours before being seated.  Insane.  In general, their food, as well as the selection, is pretty good.  I brought a friend here who recently visited China and she was impressed with how authentic the food tasted."}
{"text":"Entire dessert bar was convenience store snacks. Oatmeal pies cut into triangles, powdered donuts from a bag, moon pies. Food was decent. They took crab legs off the menu because it was \"in high demand.\" Which doesn't make sense why they would wanna take it off the menu. Staff was very helpful and nice. Would might return again."}
{"text":"In its hey day Tin Tin was good as far as asian buffets go.  The original owners are back but the food was  only worth two stars.  No grill and limited sushi compared to last year when we were here last.  Brought our kids and their spouses tonight  but now wish we would have chosen a steak house.  For the cost we could have all eaten better food elsewhere.  I will give them 5 stars for service because we had a fabulous waitress.  She was the only good thing at Tin Tin tonight.  Not coming back to Tin Tin unless we hear that things drastically change."}
{"text":"Food was good but very expensive for buffet and drink. It was 30.00. I didn't even have the crab legs."}
{"text":"WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!  Once my favorite place to visit.  Even went by there weekly (and I live 30 minutes away) when you were closed for renovations.  I have been a loyal patron since the day you opened your doors and you did a fantastic job for years.  I travel weekly and couldn't even find anyone elsewhere that compared to Tin Tin.  Since you reopened your doors you have done nothing but get worse and worse.  From cold food on the buffet to removing crab legs from the buffet.  What are you thinking?  I kept coming back over the years despite the large price increases and the rude signs threatening additional charges for plates with food left on them.  I kept coming back because of the crab legs and hot food on the buffet.  Now it's no crab legs and the food is cold.  Why would anyone want to pay for that??  It doesn't matter that you reduced the cost.  I don't want to eat that crap and neither does anyone else.  That's why you went from people waiting for an hour for a table to no one at your restaurant anymore.  CHANGE BACK NOW or give up to the inevitable and close your doors."}
{"text":"If you love Chinese food and buffets then this is the place for you. It can get pricey but you definitely get a lot of bang for you buck!   And your not limited to Chinese, they have Sushi, as well and some American favorites for the kids. This is the place that I love going to time and time again. My thing is loading up on Crab legs and going to town.  Definitely a place everyone should experience."}
{"text":"The price to eat here is completely worth it if you know how to eat.  Do not dine here and not eat everything.  Fresh crab legs, oysters, and shrimp make the price completely worth it.  I gorge on seafood here.  Their buffet options are plentiful as well.  It's only considered pricey if you don't know how to make the most out of every buck."}
{"text":"Don't normally feel like \"gee I wish we hadn't ate there\" but that is just how we left after dinner this past Wednesday. The food all looked like it was left there since lunch. The soup was so crusty and dark I mentioned to a waitress that happened by and she mentioned it to the owner. I simply asked if she would eat that soup there on buffet . The owner came and had a new bin of soup brought out. The crab legs were good but all watery and stuck to the shells- which is an indication they are not fresh. The salad bar area did not have the usual Asian salad only some dark (almost black) sea weed salad. The Fruit was all dried out - I had to roll the oranges in the water to soften them up and the ice cream machine was \"out of Order\" ... So I don't think for 24.99 it was a good experience for me. The food was sub par for the price - the waitress was clearly uninterested in us. I did manage to find one gal who continued to check on us after she helped with the soup debacle... She continued to make sure we were okay so when it came time for the tip - she got it - though she was not the waitress at our table -  take always ...? Don't eat there mid week - the food is old and doesn't get refreshed with new food... Save your money and go to Wan Fu !"}
{"text":"Tintin has finally opened again. The depression is over! Haha. Just kidding..... But everyone is glad to see it open and running again. Prices are the same. Food is the same... With some new additions.... Soup is still my favorite. I tried the new curry broth... It was good and a little spicy.... Seeing old faces here. Wait staff, host... Etc. that's a good sign. Crab legs are only at dinner time."}
{"text":"I have never changed my review as drastically as I am doing this time. I was seriously burned by the serving utensils at their buffet.  three fingers were second degree blistered because the utensil was left in the steam on the chafing dish. when I went to complain to the management he could care less treated me with  indignity and disrespect.  He angered me more than getting burned did. When I complained and got no response from the management the employees at the restaurant came to my aid but the manager at the restaurant told me if I wanted to get a lawyer and sue to go ahead  he could get one too and didn't care. I would never ever go back to that restaurant because of the way that it's being run and buy who's running it. As It turns out the manager or maybe he was the assistant manager was the brother or brother in law of the owner. I have know Ken the owner for years and he is a fine gentleman but the manager I had to deal with should be replaced by someone who can help, not hurt the business  My hope is that enough people out there read this review and go somewhere else. There are too many other Chinese buffets to go to a place that treats you this way"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Tin Tin. Every time I come home to visit my parents in Charlotte, they wanna come here. My dad loves his buffets so I always get suckered into it. It always seem like a good idea at the time but I always leave wishing I never came!  For those of you that have been to Minado(the king of all seafood buffets) this is a cheap imitation.  Sure they have oysters and snow crab legs and clams and sushi, butthe quality is not the same. The oysters I wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole because it looks slimy and yucky. The sushi/sashimi all look like it was defrosted and I can't get myself to eat thawed out raw fish. I also skip all the hot food because its all generic american-chinese sesame chicken kinda food. The only saving graces are the crab legs which are decent and fresh, simply boiled. The pecking duck which they carve for you on the spit and put on a white bun with cucumber, housing and scallions. And the noodle soups they make to order. (I like the spicy broth)  People seem to love this place tho because there is usually a wait in weekends. You also have to be hyperagressive with getting the crab legs. But I'm not down with elbowing my way to the steam table to get my grub on."}
{"text":"You can't beat all you can eat crab legs! The buffet is HUGE and the food is amazing! Sushi, american, Chinese, Japanese, and so much more. I wouldn't come unless I was going to eat crab legs since the buffet is over $20. We come here for birthdays, graduations, and holiday parties! Absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how much longer Tin Tin's will be open. Let me start with my past experiences here.  Approx 2006- This Asian buffet restaurant was amazing. I would literally drive from Columbia SC (an hour away) to feast at this incredible restaurant. They had an amazing made to order soup bar. Delicious soup! I would sometimes go for a second bowl. Short ribs and grilled teriyaki appetizers. Fresh sushi made in front of you and made to order if you wished. Nice salad bar and Bubble Tea tapioca to enjoy. The hot bar selections were abundant. Everything from the familiar Generals Tso's  chicken to the more exotic Chicken Feet. So many choices. When we went the restaurant always was filled with about 50% Asian customers. It wasn't only \"Americanized\" Asian food but also authentic Asian cuisine. Service was fast, food was fresh and abundant. Fast forward to last year, 2017. We went and there were noticeable changes. Food was subpar. Still had the great soup and sushi. Service was lacking. I read others reviews that they stopped the AYCE Crab legs. I was never into them so this didn't affect me.  Last night...We drive down Park Road. Lights are on but only four cars in the lot. It was 6:30. Maybe to early for Charlottians to eat dinner and it was a Tuesday. We walk in and the bar section is completely dark. No hot bar, no sushi and NO SOUP!!!  The hostess politely informed us they no longer offers the buffet during dinner hours of the week. We were saddened. We were aching for the soup.  At this point I don't see it lasting much longer. They aren't offering the buffet because people stopped eating it. I will always have fond memories of Tin Tin's of the past though."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after a long day at Carowinds because we were starving and I wanted crab legs. I would never pay $25 for an Asian buffet, but for crab legs?  Absolutely! I couldn't believe the quality of the crab legs--they were fresh, large, moist, and warm.  I have never had such delicious crab legs on a buffet before.  We definitely got our money's worth on the crab legs alone.  We must have eaten about 15 clusters between the two of us!    After we were all crabbed out, we decided to try a plate of the other buffet items;  everything was average and exactly what you would expect from an asian buffet that is focused on feeding the masses. So, ignore the rest of the buffet items, go for the crab legs and eat your weight in them. They are such a great deal."}
{"text":"I see all the negative reviews , I would not pay any attention to those... You will miss out on an amazing buffet... My family and I just left and it was as amazing as it was before... We came from Orlando to South Carolina and had to visit Tin Tin.. Do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews... Good service and pleasant managers!!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I drive past Charlotte, NC, I'm tempted to stop here.  MAIN REASON:  The All You Can Eat is sooo worth it b/c the snow crab legs are medium-sized, fresh and almost never empty!  It's worth the detour and the price.  Wish there was a Tin Tin in Atlanta."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what it is! They charge like $20 per person for the dinner buffet. I know they charge the high amount since they have crab legs but for people like me who don't eat crab legs- it's a total waste. That's got to be the only thing that keeps them busy... Not impressed.  PS- My husband got several crab legs and the majority of them barely had any meat!! It was a waste of money & waste of time!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Tin Tin since it was built way way many many years ago.  And throughout the years, it's been pretty consistently good.  I always crave the soup noodles but I don't know if it's worth it anymore..  Last week, I was home for spring break and of course we went to Tin Tin to satisfy my noodle craving.  We got there, and we waited for about 20 minutes until we were seated - not a bad wait for 7pm on a Saturday night.    In the past, my parents always complained how the waitresses couldn't speak english and didn't smile or ask about how we were doing.  This time around, however, our waitress was very friendly and fluent in english - both pleasant surprises.    So the night was off to a great start.  But then! (dun dun dun!) I found a piece of plastic in the beef/noodle stirfry. We told the waitress and asked to see the manager.  The waitress apologized many times but the manager failed to show up for 10 minutes.  Now, usually if something like this happens, then my expecation is that the manager comes over as soon as he or she is free, apologizes, and then usually offers some sort of compensation.  So I was just sitting there for what felt like forever (although it was only 10 minutes), watching him stand at the podium idly, checking the seating list at times and calling people over.  I think that is a job that the hostess can do herself while you leave for two minutes.  Furthermore, when he came, he looked at the piece of plastic and apologized in a \"sorry not sorry\" tone without any offer of a discount for our meal.  Knowing that this would be my last visit, I ordered one last bowl of noodles.  Goodbye yummy noodles forever..   For the amount you pay for this food, go somewhere fancy downtown.  For being part of the SERVICE industry, they (the managers, not the waitress I had) suck at service.    So we paid, we left, and we won't ever be going back.  #saltycustomer"}
{"text":"There were people with yellow Tyvex suits cleaning it out. Renovation is an understatement. I would have to say this place is closed up or stripping walls bare for entire rework."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and it was quite good. Lots more of a selection than I am used to, and much more authentic-looking than a typical Chinese buffet; they had everything from duck and fresh noodles to your typical american fare like french fries.  Lunch was $8.95 plus $1.45 for a drink, so I think it's a good value. Dinner was, I think, about $16 on weekdays, and a dollar or two more on weekends/holidays.  I would've rated it 5 stars, but some of the food seemed like it was out a little too long (maybe because it's a Wednesday and I went around 2pm when lunch stops at 3). Some of the food just didn't taste right because it had kind of dried out sitting on the buffet.  All-in-all, highly recommended if you are looking for a nice buffet."}
{"text":"Finally, a buffet worth a darn in Charlotte! Having recently moved from Las Vegas, we know a thing or two about buffets, and Charlotte is certainly lacking in this department. However, Tin Tin is a pretty good one, albeit a little pricey (cost us $32 with tip and 2 soft drinks for LUNCH). But, they did have a fresh food station, where they cook up some tasty meats, soups and sushi. They had your standards like sesame chicken, lo mein, etc.   They obviously cater to the Asian crowd as they had many seafood items that you normally wouldn't see (crawfish, whole fish with scales, etc.). And there were plenty of Asian customers in there, which usually is a GOOD thing as they normally wouldn't patronize a sub-par place.  And the food indeed was tasty, decent quality and a nice variety.  I imagine that the dinner for 2 would be in the $50 range, which again, especially for Charlotte, is pretty pricey. But I think lunch certainly is worth it. Just bring your appetite and you'll get your money's worth."}
{"text":"So you know by the amount of stars that I already don't like this place.  I will do my best to be kind and ignore the not-so-important points like this place looks like a strip club at night.  It was in fact, on my own accord that I walked in here - so I have no one to blame but myself.  But in all fairness I'd like to throw a quick middle finger to those yelpers to added to the average 4 stars this place has received.  That is false advertising people!  You are supposed to help a sister out, not walk her into the lions den.    So I walked into Tin-Tin, all glitz and glamour, it looked pretty good!  Not to mention there were a lot of butts in the seats - so how bad could this place really be?!  I was hungry and really looking for a solid Chinese buffet that I could gorge myself on.  We sat down and the waitress took our drink order.  We then walked over to the buffet, looked around and made our selections.  I started with a few small portions so I could try everything.  The pork dumpling was so foul that I literally spit it out into a napkin!  I was embarrassed, but the thought of swallowing it was more horrifying.  The green beans were SOAKED in a thick garlic sauce, the sesame chicken was chewy - and not in a good way... not to mention the sauce looked like gold jello.  The lomein was tasteless.  The only thing I did like was the sesame bean ball -- which is hard to mess up!   After our first plate we were so unimpressed that we decided to do fruit/dessert and get on our way.  The fruit was mostly hard and I'm fairly certain their frozen yogurt is just flavored ice.  The waitress comes over and hands us our bill.  $23 dollars a person?!  WHAT!?  Not only was this meal disgusting, robbing me of any satisfaction.... now it's robbing my wallet too!    It was at this point we looked up and realized everyone was hoarding crab legs and oysters.  OH.  Wish someone would have let us know that the ONLY reason people came here was for the seafood.... I just wanted a good old fashion Chinese buffet to get full on... is that too much to ask?  As a last ditch effort I tried a crab leg and a clam.  The clam tasted like they marinated it in wet cat food and the crab was nothing to write  home about.  I do NOT recommend this place to anyone, friend or foe."}
{"text":"My critique begins as all critiques begin, with doubt.  I frequented Tin Tin recently for dinner with a good friend of mine and was thoroughly disappointed in the food, the restaurant, and the dining experience as a whole. Chinese buffet restaurants tend to run in a middle sort of groove. No great highs, no crippling lows. The only time they are really exceptional is the first six mos to a year they are open. Soon after that things go downhill, some faster than others. This particular restaurant was fairly nice visually, but once I put my glasses on I could see the filthy floors and walls, and greasy tables. Describing the food on the buffet is like dancing to no music. Most of the items I sampled on the buffet were either underseasoned, flavorless, or not fresh. The sesame chicken for example, looked like it had been in those trays under heat lamps all day. Most of the vegetable offerings were very oily and greasy. The sushi bar was slightly better, but most of the sushi I sampled was a little too fishy and the seaweed salad was like mush.  The best thing I had in the buffet was the Thai style chicken, but it wasnt impressive by any means. The highlight of the night was watching my date who only had one plate of sushi vomit in the parking lot shortly after we got to the car. Tin Tin was a serious disappointment.  I might go back for a second attempt, probably wont."}
{"text":"Some friends and I thought it would be a good idea to head here for dinner.  Not so much....  I typically don't like buffets in general but have done them.  This was really not that great.  Pleasant staff but food was so-so.  Should I decide to ever go to a Chinese Buffet in the future, it won't be this place."}
{"text":"one of the best chinese buffet ever.  not a humongous selection, but a variety of quality food. sushi, noodle soups, tropical fruits, crab legs, etc.  a must go to place when we are in town."}
{"text":"Once was something to rave about.. those times are long gone. Food is below average, I honestly feel like I'm taking my chances taking a bite into something.  Not as good as it once was. Had a great run but I'm pretty sure new ownerships are having a tough time to get their shit together on this place. Return to what it once was and people will come back. For the mean time ... stay away."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. they have all kinds of stuff that is actually good: ham hocks, escargot, steamed fish, pho, and steamed buns. the sushi isn't crazy good, but is okay especially for a buffet. the crab legs and oysters are very fresh too. the wait is pretty long, but always worth it. i mean it's a buffet, so it's okay to go in extra hungry!"}
{"text":"For this to be a buffet,  not much of variety.  Too expensive,  and the food is terrible.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This popular restaurant is always crowded and offers a huge array of everything - hard to find Asian favorites (like chicken feet and hog ears), savory soups made to order, expansive sushi bar and all the other usuals.   HOWEVER after about five visits, I've had it with the rude service and the low sanitation scores (typically in the high 80s.) Salmonella must not be a real concern for its regular customers, nor the owners. That's a shame because I would really like eat there, but no worries TinTin, your parking lot will still be full, regardless of my bad review and all the others."}
{"text":"We visit tintin every Monday lunch.  It's a good place to have all combined asian food buffet restaurant.  They have alcohol, such as wine and beers.  They also have Japanese sushi rolls and nigiri.  Their regular food includes Chinese lo mei, stir vegetables and white rice and noodles; dim sum and red beam bum.  They don't have a lot chicken, but sea food and pork are all there.  I love their fried jumbo shrimp, curry noodles and spicy sour soup."}
{"text":"I always passed by Tin Tin and it is always packed. So I finally made it in and expecting great food. I was disappointed. For the price they charged for buffet the food should have been so much better. The food did not stand out. They had a lot of station but nothing was worth raving about. The food was bland and the seafood was sucky. I will not go back and I advise if you never been there don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I'd first like to start off by saying, me giving this restaurant a 2 star rating is being generous. It would be an understatement to say that the food here is bad. To be thorough in my evaluation of this place, I tried just about everything on the menu, all coming to one conclusion. TERRIBLE. I don't want to sound as if I have an underlying  issue with this place, I'm just a disappointed customer. I would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"I love this place.   ;) so most that work here don't speak English well so they don't say much.  Not a bad thing, it is what it is.  The wide variety of food on the Buffet explains perfectly who is eating here.  Chicken feet.  Duck.  Crawfish. Butter shrimp.  Crab legs.  (The real reason to go) no crab at lunch only dinner.  Fri sat sun dinner is almost 25$ per person.  The signs all over the restaurant repeatedly say don't waste food so we can keep prices low.   Price used to be under 20$ per person couple years ago.  Waste and food costs are so high.  But still all you can eat crab legs.   No one offers that any more.  Sunday brunch buffets are pushing 40$ per person so I think the price here is still good!!! Don't expect 5 stars or excellence in dining.  It's a buffet.   But do leave a tip and enjoy a very good one at that!!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch, sure it's a pretty good steal. Dinner? No way. Still doesn't make me feel like buffets are worth it. This one is located in South Charlotte, right off of 485. It's a little, lets say, worn. It's been here for quite a while and well, if you go into the bathrooms you are sure to see some interesting graffiti.   While on the outside, they try to make it look grand and majestic, it just isn't what they want it to be. Actually, to be honest I'm amazed that they're still standing and in business. I guess buffets never go out of style, but if you've read my reviews on buffets you know I'm not as fond.  So, what's Tin Tin's assortment of food? You know the usual American Chinese food mixed in with some Japanese \"sushi\" and some soups/noodles. This is only for lunch. I hear that during dinner there is a wider assortment and a little more of the pricier items, hence the price difference.   The food was well, food. Nothing exciting. Nothing amazing. And somewhere where I would never go if not for company wanting to go and eat. Maybe it's great for big parties, but when it comes to Chinese food, I just get picky. I probably won't come back here because (1) it's a buffet, (2) I've had better buffets, and (3) rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Soooooooo disappointed.... Used to be one of my favorites but now just an overpriced bland buffet.   Your best bet is to go with the soups... Saving grace??? Is the large selection of ok tasting belly filler"}
{"text":"If anyone is wanting a snow crab buffet to enjoy, do not come during lunch hours. Arrive only during dinner hours. They only serve it then. Other than that. The food wasn't that great. Poor selection of foods to choose. I've been to better Chinese buffets that has a whole variety of foods to choose from."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 10 years, and I see the price increased from $12.95 to $23.95 now at weekend!  This place is great for unlimited crablegs and other seafood, but don't expect much out of the service. I mean let me rephrase.. there's no service at all!!!!  All the service barely speak English, which is not a problem. The thing is they all looked like they are constipated for days. No smile on the face whatsoever....  so if you can ignore the service, the food is great. also, make sure you starve yourself for half a day before you go to make the money worth."}
{"text":"This had been the best in town for many years. I moved away and came back about 3 years ago and couldn't wait to go back. It's been about 3 years till I tried it again today because how disappointed I was.  I had heard that the original owners were back and they are. It IS ONCE AGAIN the best around. I gave it 4 stars because a lot of the food was a little cold at 12:30. They were not very busy today at lunch. But the selection is great along with the service. Lots of sushi. Roasted lamb. Missed the sho mi. The Butter shrimp is a litter different. But it's once again some of the best buffet food anywhere. Can't wait to go back. So if you were like me very disappointed on your last visit Please try one more time. You will surprised at the change and be very happy you did."}
{"text":"They have reopened!!!!! They did some slight freshening up on the decor. They still have the same offerings but they are doing them in smaller batches do that they will be fresher and better quality"}
{"text":"Would not star it at all but don't think i can review without something. Have not been in a while and we wanted Chinese buffet so we went for dinner last nite. Everything was absolutely horrible. Butter shrimp, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, pork egg roll, champagne chicken. The only thing that was any good was the crinkle cut fries and the white rice. The three if us will never return."}
{"text":"I used to come here years ago, right after it opened up. I used to bring family and friends to a (at that time) best Chinese buffet around. But, like most of these places, as time went by and food quality declined, so did my visits. I received one of their advertising flyers that they went through remodeling, and to visit them after all the changes. So I did. Honestly I see no changes. Perhaps few different food items, but overall it's the same old place. Not trying to say anything bad about the place, just little disappointed that the standards didn't go back where they used to be when they opened. Still a decent lunch."}
{"text":"Food was cold, really no options on the food. Really disappointed for eatting here for the first time. SMH"}
{"text":"Price gouging 25 for a Chinese buffet that was less then average. Capitalism meets gecko"}
{"text":"My family use to come here DAILY for years! This says a lot since we lived like 35 minuets away, but we use to love coming here for the unlimited crab legs and fresh, good food! It's been a while since we were last here because of the drive but we decided to revisit this place again. We were kinda shook when we arrived because it wasn't crowded as it use to be, and it was a Sunday. This place use to be PACKED like the wait would be 45 minutes on the weekends! But it was kinda slow, also they took away the unlimited crab legs! Whatttt!! Their food also declined A LOT, the sushi was a bit dry, fish wasn't cooked all the way and some of the food looked as if it was sitting out there for days. It was disappointing since my family used to love this place. The only bright side was that they added steam buns! Hopefully they get their game up again, because at this rate the food is just going downhill."}
{"text":"The atmosphere has changed greatly. I drove 1 hour to enjoy unlimited crab legs and was very disappointed to find out they don't have them on the bar anymore. The crab legs were the only reason I traveled this far to eat Asian food. Never again! The food is mediocre, limited variety of sushi, the soup doesn't even taste the same. Goodbye Tin Tin! I will find another restaurant to patronize."}
{"text":"I ate here at lunch today.  Just like most buffets, the seating, beverage service, and checkout were very efficient and the staff were pretty polite.  I though this place had a wonderful variety of food, possibly more variation than I've ever seen in the past at a buffet.  They had a few of the traditional dishes such as beef and peppers, chicken and broccoli, egg/spring rolls, etc, and about 6-7 different kinds of fish.  The had a separate sushi bar which a large variety of rolls amount other items which I didn't even recognize --though my sushi knowledge is quite limited.  They had a ton of over foods which were good for kids, such as fries, Smiley Faces, chicken nuggets, etc.  They also had a nice array of soups and a pretty decent dessert spread, too.  The place itself felt a but grungy, and the bathroom smelt like, well, a bathroom --just one which hadn't been cleaned in a while.  The overall experience was good and I though the food was pretty tasty.  I'll certainly make a lunch stop here again --not so sure about evening, though."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Their sushi is my favorite, as I haven't been to any other buffet in town that has comparable stuff. The food isn't that amazing though, I guess I've just gotten tired of the same thing over and over since I've gone. I wish they would add some new items on now that they've been in business for such a long time. The one thing I did not like was the fact that all the employees came out and started eating within 5 minutes of me being there, I guess I'll have to try and go earlier next time?"}
{"text":"Been here couple times. The food sometimes plain and cold. Basically its all about luck if you go on the right day or not; but it acceptable. The only reason i come here are for seafoods. I can understand it a little pricey. But i can't accept it when the services are terrible. * I dont feel comfortable while eat and the waitress staring down at me, talk to each other, laughed... And back to staring. *Whenever i go with my bf's mom, they got attitude and rolled eyes serving her but not me.  shes mexican and im asian. So tell me they're not racist. They shouldn't be, because they dont even speak English, hiding in the corner talking to each other their language the whole time. * Asked my sister for refill, she responded \"yes please\", and the waitress just walked away until 10 minutes later came back with another one ask again... So.. Wtf?  Especially Those waitresses on the right of the restaurant where the oysters side are mostly for 4 people, i wouldnt sit there any minute! Im telling you they got attitude more than others.  Im an easy customers just want to eat in peace and go home.  But everytime i come same thing happen, is it because an asian dating a mexican?? Thats insulting!!"}
{"text":"You got one star because it wouldn't let me give you anything less it was the worst Food experience I have ever seen ever had it looks good it smells good it tastes like garbage this is my opinion in my opinion only fortunately I don't live in this area cuz if I did that would be going there anyway so I'm going to go over there now anyway so before you go check all the all the reviews in here thank you"}
{"text":"Up front,  we decided to give them a try again.  Received a buy one get one free coupon,  to learn that the coupon actually  good for $10 off, but the buffet cost was $13.99....totally misleading,  misrepresenting coupon.  As for the food: okay, at best.  Had the restaurant not been ice cold, the food may have been better.   The minute you set it on the granite table top,  all heat goes away and you have cold food.   Provided feedback to the management and all they had to offer was \"sorry \".  Terrible customer service. Unacceptable response. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Hit up Tin Tin yesterday for lunch while working in the area. It wasn't bad at all....for a buffet. I'm usually not a big buffet fan, just for fresh food reasons, but everything here was pretty good. They have a hot grill station cooking all the time, as well as a sushi station. I did not try the sushi (way too scared to eat buffet sushi), but many others were eating it.  The big draw here seemed to be crayfish, which I would not expect at a Chinese buffet. But most people had a big bowl for the shells, and were going at those things like they were about to become extinct. The egg rolls were not that great, just nasty cabbage, nothing else. The sesame chicken was a little too sweet for my taste. But hey, its a buffet, I was not expecting gourmet food. Would love to come back and try more, as there was a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome.  After they closed and reopened, the food has never been the same. They have half the selection at approximately  $5 more per plate than other buffets ($17 more if you want crab legs).  I keep going back hoping the food will get better and I am consistently disappointed. I am going at the prime times and the food seems like it's a day old. The food that is actually fresh is bland. If you spring for the crab legs, be prepared to fight the line to actually get some.  Other times there are no plates to get the food. The service is not good either. I'm not judging on whether the staff actually understands English, but whether you can actually get a drink when you order it without asking for it a second time.  I just spent 2 hour there (45 minutes for the check) and was only able to get a couple refills. I don't know what has changed, but it seems like they are short staffed and trying to squeeze every cent out of the restaurant at the cost of the food quality and service. I go in hoping for the old times and leave feeling like I've been had."}
{"text":"I'd put 0 stars out of 5 if it was an option.  Decent variety but awful flavor. I think the worst part of it all was the $25 per person price tag and being charged $2 for a glass of tap water. Don't be fooled by the neon lights and full parking lot. Just keep driving."}
{"text":"Tin TIn is one of the best buffets I've ever been to, and it's some of the most exciting, authentic, and delicious Chinese food I've ever had. The place makes me wish I had two stomachs, as I'm never able to eat as much as I'd like.  The steamed peach buns are amazing, and the fresh sushi bar is excellent. There's all kinds of weird meats and seafood for the adventurous carnivores, and there's lots of veggie options including both the Chinese buffet standards (lo mein, spring rolls, etc.) and exotic oddities.   The Thai stuffed tofu is excellent, and I've heard from those who partake that the crab legs are very fresh and yummy. There are always little bowls on the tables for collecting the cast off shells of the crabs. I get a little freaked out by the scene of crab-leg eating, but I try not to let that distract me from the Chinese foodfest.  It's a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the trip. I recommend going on a weekday, as the weekends can get a little chaotic (and, it's also a little cheaper during the week)."}
{"text":"I came to visit this place after not living in the area for nearly 3 years. At first, the reviews scared me. I used to love this place and was wondering what happened. But I took a chance and I'm glad I did. Me and my entire family loved it. Yes it's $24.95 but there's so much seafood on the bar, what do you expect? Where else can you get unlimited crab legs, shrimp, mussels, crawfish and traditional Chinese cuisine for that price? Yes there are cheaper Chinese buffets but they don't have near as much variety. So yeah if you're cheap, don't come. Eat fast food. We enjoyed the food and the service was great. I hope this restaurant stays around and continues to have success."}
{"text":"I gave this place four stars because, I love buffets that has good seafood, particularly, blue crabs! Recently, they did not have them....  My coworker, last year had mentioned I could get blue crabs at a Chinese buffet.  Being leary, we met up and the rest is history!  Location - a bit of a drive, towards South of Charlotte, between CVS and some Baby store.  Place - it was huge! But was I surprised? Nah, I have seen huge Chinese buffet restaurants before. But the inside, they had a lot of tables and chairs to accomodate the customers.  There are aisles and different selections of food that were actually good.  I have been to some buffets and most of the time, it was a turn off. But here, it is definitely worth your trip.  Selections -  There a handful of desserts (I love their egg-tarts!), dim-sum like dishes (I liked the shrimp dumplings and sticky rice), Vietnamese dishes and buns, in the middle of the restaurant, lies their  cold dishes, such as seafood of oysters, sushi, freshly cut fruits, sometimes they have Asian exotic fruits (one time, I had dragonfruits)!  On the other side of the middle island, lies their delicious green onion pancake, short rib beef (I feel like it was Vietnamese style) that I was yummy.But boy, people really come here for the snow crab legs!  Price - It was pricey, but with good food, and unlimited crabs I could eat, I did not mind the price. I think for my husband and I, at 5pm, it came up to be $60 (including tip)."}
{"text":"One of the biggest, cleanest Chinese buffet restaurants I've been to. There are crab legs which I like to pile up on first when I go for dinner. Also other unique things such as snail, frog legs, duck, sushi, and other American foods as well like chicken nuggets and fries. There is much more than what I've listed here though. Definitely worth the money if you have a bottomless pit for a stomach."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just moved to the area and we thought this place looked great from the outside with all of the lights and color. Then we went inside and the place was gross. Dirty floors and the Windows over the food had hand prints all over them. The food was not great and when we went to pay our bill for the buffet we were shocked when our total was $30 each...don't go here."}
{"text":"Once again, they're closed for renovation. The sign on the door says, \"Closed as of September 1, will open soon.\"  Hopefully, they'll bring back crab legs. That's the only reason why anybody wants to eat there."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over ten years, but the last couple of times the food was not as good. Last week we ate there and everything was barely warm, fried shrimp was cold. I told the waiter and the Manager, nothing but sorry. To top it off they charged my card twice. I called the Manager and he said give it a few days.well, still on card so having to dispute it. My last visit to what used to be my favorite."}
{"text":"Pork chops, curry soup, are tasty   Lo Mai Gai is good but has no lap cheung  Dofu pi juan is vegetarian"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you want to eat leftover food from customers. I heard that they make their employees take crabs from people finished plate and reuse to cook crab asparagus soup. That's just gross! If you guys don't make enough money then just shut it down. Reusing food that other people have touched is just not right. This buffet was good 5+ years ago."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had really high hopes. I love a good buffet. A good variety of foods but the flavor was lacking in every single one...even the cups of ice cream. No crab legs for lunch but I figured as much. The ginger clams bland, shrimp oily and odd taste, Thai chicken dry, sushi thin and barely any fish, butter shrimp heavily breaded...sigh. The hot and sour soup was decent after I added salt. Won't return to this one."}
{"text":"Not like it was.  So this place is known for its big buffet with unlimited crab legs and oysters along with everything else.  Well it closed down a few months ago for reasons un-known and it just opened back up, under \"new management \" it claims.  So, since this is my parents favorite place to go, we decided to go there for Easter dinner.  The place was sort of crowded but no wait, so we sat right down, ordered our drinks and grabbed our plates and headed to see what was new.  The buffet was lacking.  I'd say more than half of the trays were empty.  The food that was out did not look appetizing at all and there was a super long line with people waiting for crab legs (which weren't out yet).  Everything was empty, even the sushi and hot pot area had minimal items and not alot of staff around to help.  The place was so dirty and unorganized.  We thought maybe because it was a holiday, but even when we got up and left over a hour later, the place had not changed.  Still dirty and minimal food.  We won't be back, sorry it is not worth it.  Oh, and they raised the weekend buffet price to 22.95 a person.  HA boy were we surprised.   No more tin tin for us."}
{"text":"I love love love this place.. but I have to say only for the CRAB LEGS and butter shrimp, mostly everything else taste like street corner Chinese food... but you cant beat 19.99 All-You-Can eat Crab legs if your a Crab Leg Lover. If you go to Red Lobster you will only be getting a few clusters and a Butter Roll for 20.00 and you won't leave full. I say go here if you are in the mode for crab legs... or oysters.. I'm not into oysters but I see people there enjoying them.. like they taste good lol"}
{"text":"I love Asian food but there is definitely a lack of buffets with good food, that is clean, and has good service...so I usually stick to Brazilian buffets like Chima or Amor de Brazil.  I only come to Tin Tin for the unlimited crab legs because it is always stocked,  hot, and doesn't taste frost bitten. The other foods worth mentioning are the steam buns with duck and fried salted shrimp. Other than that, I don't really like the other items.  Also, I don't know what is is about the waitstaff here but they always look depressed.  Kinda hard to enjoy your meal with that face staring at you.  All in all, I'll always come back because the crab legs are on point! Roughly $25 is not all that bad for what you get."}
{"text":"This place use to be good before they switched owners. By far horrible service and food now. The new owner is rude and rushing you out the door. What is up with all of these posted signs anyway?? You pay a lot and it is called a BUFFET for a reason. Geesh! It won't be long before this new owner runs away all of his customers."}
{"text":"Tin Tin is as good as you will find for an \"asian buffet\" in North Carolina.  All those haters posting reviews about \"paying $25 for bad asian food\" - next time read the sign: BUFFET.  This ain't world class asian food by any stretch.  It's buffet. It appeals to the masses. It's crowded - which is good - it means the food is refreshed, not sitting for hours.  I think it's plenty good.   I also eat alot, so I get my money's worth.  Go if you are hungry and need asian food.  Don't go if you expect Nobu sushi or some other unrealistic expectation of a buffet. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Oh boy! Poor quality. NO CRAB LEGS included in the buffets. I visited this place in 2/2017 and I must say that they sure have changed, food quality, ownership, employees or something must not be working for them. I was looking forward to the crab legs since my last visit to this place. I was disappointed because now the crab legs are ordered and they charge per pound. No sign mentioning this. It bugs me when someone buys a new place and keeps the name where customers are expecting the high quality and now get suckered into a meal that is not worth it."}
{"text":"Food is subpar at best. Nothing much on the bar and if there is, it's cold. I went for crabs, but they don't put them on the bar until 4pm. Prices don't match website."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper Elisa S. and I were undecided where to go to lunch today, so we figured why not try Tin Tin - seemed like they had a little bit of everything! So away we went and what we got wasn't so Tip Top.  The good was that there's alot of room in there so the large lunch crowd didn't feel too stuffy in with us. The staff is friendly and quick. The sweet and sour chicken was really good, along with the beef and bean sprouts and the Thai Chicken (by far, the best dish!).  The bad was more plentiful - spring and egg rolls that contained nothing other than tasteless cabbage, no crab ragoons (my fave!), no tofu offerings (sad), a variety of heavily ethnic things which I couldn't bring myself to smell (chicken feet OMG), and a sad excuse for a sushi bar (the spicy tuna roll looked more like pimento cheese and rice).  We won't be returning - I think Dragon Buffet near 485/S Tryon still reigns as the best chinese buffet in town!"}
{"text":"The crablegs are great.. The atmosphere is good Bathrooms could be bigger with more stalls and upgrade the televisions to the 21st century    The sushi is good fresh ... The price Is good as well    I will be back"}
{"text":"Used to be really good. Not any more. It smells bad. After I ate lobster salad, I vomited several times. It is disgusted ( I did not tried much). Chicken feet and all \"authentic\" Chinese dim sum tasted bad. Peking duck looks really dark instead of gloden looking. I was told that the owner changed last year."}
{"text":"First of all, this review is specifically in relation to Asian buffets. You can't compare apples to oranges, so don't bother comparing this place to a fine steakhouse. With that said, this is about as good as it gets in Charlotte for Asian buffets. You won't find a larger and more authentic selection of Asian food anywhere in the QC. From dim sum to pho, chow fun to lo mein, steamed crawfish and white fish, pot stickers, sushi, and the obligatory (yet surprisingly good) chicken wings just for good measure. If the sight of chicken feet grosses you out, just stick with your local Panda Express. But if you've come to venture beyond the Americanized version, this place will suit your needs. There's a reason the place is always packed, and noticeably with lots of Asian people. If you don't like crab legs, save yourself some cash and come for lunch. Dinner is significantly more expensive and the only differences are the crab legs and the Beijing duck."}
{"text":"Just a okay buffet close on time you have to grab something to eat if you arrive late."}
{"text":"Crab legs are good but the floor is always dirty and the crumbs from the table are just brushed into the chairs and/or booths."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time yesterday & was disappointed as I've herd great things about it in the past.  The food was cold and most of it was very bland. The soft serve ice cream tasted like soap. I don't know what else I expected of a buffet. The whole experience was disappointing , I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I was SOOOOOOO disappoint in the food. We have gone there for years and had always enjoyed the food, but it has been declining. Now that they have taken away the sushi that was the last straw. We will not be back. We are very sad that we have lost what used to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Aye there yesterday and my husband has been sick since. My food was cold and barely edible. We ate different things thankfully so I didn't get sick. The people were nice but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Me and my friend attended this restaurant me having heard mixed reviews I didn't know what to think. But now I would say 2 stars at best here are my reasons:  Pros: - I loved the ample amount of oysters :) this is probably the only place I have found that offers oysters in that abundance and fresh out of the shell, it was simply heaven. -ample choices, very versatile compared to most buffets   Cons: -The prepared food was cold      ( This is the main reason for the two stars, my friend doesn't eat cold food and it was such a horrible experience for him, he pulled two plates and sat down to eat and all of his food was cold not even 7 minutes after sitting to the table) - Staff did not seem understanding at all      (Our waitress didn't speak English, the waitress she called over didn't speak English, and the manager had a prepared speech for the issue which had absolutely no value to my friends complaint)  SERVICE WITHOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE - if your looking to stuff your face with cold food and you don't need much customer service this is the spot for you. -if you like oysters !! This is a good place to go  Outside if that I will not be referring anyone to this place."}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised I've never written a review for this place. I have been coming here ever since they opened, and I think that's like at least 8 years or more ago. Over the years, this place has changed management recently, prices have gone up and the food variety has diminished, quality has also shrunk a bit.  But, overall, you really can't beat the Tin Tin experience, meaning for what you paid for,  you get a good BANG for your buck. I am not sure if it's worth coming here for dinner or eating here over the weekends, because the price would be closer to around $20. Seriously, for a price like that, I don't care if you treat me to raw oysters, crab legs and such, it's still a bit hard to justify, for a buffet at least. It's not the grandest of experience and not Las Vegas buffet with a endless array of selections. However, with that said, a typical week day lunch price tag is pretty great, around $10, you get some tasty bites. I love  that this place has a noodle station, where they make fresh soup noodle in front of you, yum. The stir fries here are pretty tasty as well, dim sum, great selection of soup, seafood, and pastries. They even have tapioca dessert, heck yah! They also have a fresh skillet place where they fry turnlip cakes, and dumplings in front of you. Of course, any good Asian buffet will have sushi, which this place has.   Overall, why not? But just a bit sad that the quality keeps going down, but I don't anticipate this place to be closing down any time soon, because it's been around for long enough to stay alive, which is saying A LOT because there are a BUNCH of Asian restaurants out there. Honestly, I think I'd be mildly sad if this place ever closes down.   If you are craving for an authentic Asian buffet experience, this is it! The taste here is very on par with Chinatown dishes."}
{"text":"A friend of ours introduced us to Tin Tin last summer and we've been a few times (most recently yesterday). We were appropriately prepped about the long lines and have only been to Tin Tin on weekends for dinner right as it opens. And other than Rusan's I haven't been to any other buffets in Charlotte, so I don't have much to compare it to.   The selections are pretty standard Chinese buffet selections. Standard soups, fried rice, various chicken and beef dishes, and some seafood. We usually come here for the snow crab legs and the blue crabs, and the shrimp. Unfortunately they didn't have blue crabs yesterday, but the previous other times that we went, they had them and we liked them. The oysters were a bit disappointing yesterday, but in the past they've been alright.   The service is alright. Some servers were more attentive than others. Some would clear our plates a little earlier than they probably should have, but that's not a big deal to me.   I did notice that their sushi is pretty good, and they have various steamed buns, peking duck, made to order noodle soups, and even have ventured into a couple more \"fusiony\" dishes. I did get to sample a little of that, and they did not disappoint.   Overall we're pretty satisfied with Tin Tin. Again, we're not big on buffets in general, but when we're in the mood for crab legs and shrimp this is our place. And it's great because the standard buffet selections look pretty good too. Variety is good. I'd recommend it here."}
{"text":"this is a monumental review, because i don't do chinese. AND i especially don't do chinese buffets. i used to work at one in my college years, and it grossed me out what people did at the buffet lines and all the ultra-fried foods they preferred to eat vs. the fresher and more authentic chinese delicacies. and although i am asian, chinese is my least favorite ethnic cuisine to eat.   so when i said i wanted to eat chinese one day, i think my husband thought i was a different person. randomly, we drove by tin tin when i said i wanted this and decided to try it.   when we walked in, i was pleasantly surprised by how many actual chinese people were in the place. to me, that is a good sign. when the people who could make this food at home are at a restaurant, there must be something to it--right? well, what was great about this place was that it was huge. there was the typical, fried items that most westerners know of chinese food. then, there were some things like chicken feet and steamed buns and some of the gelatinous goo (congee? no disrespect. i just have texture issues) that chinese people like.   anyway, the price is great. there is a lot of variety (stir fry, fresh-made soups, sushi, salads, fried foods, desserts, seafood, steamed food) and actually some good stuff considering it's a buffet (in my opinion). we've already been here 2x in the span of knowing about it only in the past month. we don't want to go there too often, because we don't want to end up in the obese stats. so if you happen to be in south charlotte and have a hankering for it, check it out. oh yeah...they close their lunch buffet around 3, i think. so don't go thinking you can eat a late lunch or an early dinner."}
{"text":"Zero stars was not an option!  $90.00 for 3 of us.  Food was cold.  After our first plates we struggled to find other things to try.  Food got so bad we were scared to continue.  We left hungry and ripped off .  We kept trying to figure out how they are still open?  We could have had Firebirds for the same price and had fine dinning first class service :(  it's just horrible."}
{"text":"Crab legs are the hit here! Lots and lots of crab legs.  Cooked to perfection!  There is quite a bit of selection from American to seafood to sushi to salads, fruit, desserts.  It has it all. Native English speakers are not going to be easy to find but they are efficient.  Food taste is generally good. Some are better than others.  Sushi was good but not great. Salads were good, not great, as was the dessert, clay pot, and just about everything else.  The really good stuff included the crab legs and the roasted duck.  Didn't try the personalized soup and stir fry counter.  Selection is incredibly thorough, food IS good, just not great.    Service was good, for the most part. Floor was vinyl and sticky everywhere.  So cleanliness needed improvement.  With so many people there, reservations are recommended but food is always fresh!  I'd eat here again but try to get there earlier so the mess won't be so bad when we arrive.  Go for the crab legs and prepare to get messy!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because of all the negative reviews.  I'm writing as I go, so we'll see.  So far,  it's about 1pm and there is a busy lunch crowd. I was seated and received drinks within 3 minutes.  The server is very pleasant and efficient.  The sushi buffet area is fresh and well supplied. There is salmon,  octopus, eel, shrimp and a few others.  The clams were delicious.  There is a soup area,  I'll try it next time, but from what I see, the soups look fantastic.  The rest is the usual fare found at Chinese buffets.  One thing that needs improvement...there are no labels on any of the food.  Some, of course,  are self explanatory but the majority,  I didn't recognize them.  For lunch,  $9.99 is a good price."}
{"text":"If you have a monsterous, craving hunger for:  1. Crab legs 2. Generic sushi 3. Limited dim sum 4. Usual Americanized Chinese food fare  ... Congrats my friend, for you have hit the jack pot.   I went here a little while ago with a few friends, who insisted that this was not just a place to gorge yourself, but to find a little bit of everything, and they were right. The crab legs are plentiful and fresh, so get ready to have a crackin' good time.   The dim sum was pretty good, but nothing spectacular, and a lot of the things I love about dim sum were missing. Also, the chicken feet looked sketch. Most people would say well yeah, they're chicken feet, and I agree, but I happen to love chicken feet. I have eaten them many different places. This was not one of them.   When I was told they would have a wide sushi array, I was excited... only to be let down a bit. Yes there was indeed a spread, but it housed your typical California rolls, tempura rolls, Philly rolls (blech), dragon rolls... not a single piece of nigiri in the house. They did have some tuna sashimi, but it was floating in a vat of chili mayo. Luckily I also liked chili mayo, so I did have a portion. However I would have liked the option to have without, and it made me wonder why they chose to mask the smell and color of their only sashimi selection.  I can see why people would like this place, and the food that I did have was good, which is why this place is getting three stars. However, if you are into something a little more specialized (which is not what you get at a buffet I realize, also why posting the three stars), then you are not going to be as hyped as your friends about this place."}
{"text":"I once went to tin tin 2 years ago. And I was skeptical of the price. Then upon entering realized that they had fresh crab legs and other fresh seafood options and left a happy customer.   Fast forward to yesterday, July 25th, 2017. The crab legs on the buffet is gone. I looked around and there were still plenty of food options so I wasn't too disappointed. I went around and grabbed a couple of items I thought looked appealing. They were all freezing cold, soggy, or impossible to chew. I put my plate away and ventured back to the buffet. Thinking I just got a couple of bad options. I grabbed sushi, shrimp, and a noodle bowl and headed back to my chair. Upon placing one piece of sushi into my mouth I instantly gagged and spit it out. I have never tasted something so sour in my life. I peeled open one shrimp. It was surprisingly, edible. I scooped up my fork, hopeful I just picked bad items and the rest of the buffet would be delicious, and slung some noodles into my mouth. That was a mistake. They were overcooked and tougher than shoelaces. I made one last trip. Chicken wings and ice cream. I hesitantly bit into the wing. It was actually pretty good. Slightly overcooked but definitely better than the other options.  I instantly went back and grabbed a plate of wings, my saving grace. I finished them off hastily. I knew what to expect with the ice cream and I wasn't disappointed. Just normal soft serve, vanilla, chocolate or mixed.   Overall, I would say avoid this restaurant until they make improvements. It made me really upset to once be so happy with this restaurant and then severely disappointed. One star."}
{"text":"In the Chinese Buffet category, Tin Tin is always 5 stars and as good as it gets.  We have tried every Chinese buffet in the Charlotte area and this one can't be beat.  We have also tried Chinese buffets in other states and Tin Tin is always the gold standard to which we measure all other buffets against.  The food is fresh and delicious and the selection can't be beat.  They have something for everyone and there's even a section of the buffet for the young picky palates.  Every time I dine here, the majority of the diners are Asian...that's a tell-tale sign for me that the food is authentic and delicious!   I don't have a huge appetite, but I can eat a good amount of crab legs so that makes it well worth the price, for me.    They also have a great selection of sushi and they always have special items such as Peking Duck, Crispy Pork, Chicken Feet, etc.  We're not talking about your run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant here!     In addition to their many hot foods, there are also a number of \"stations: ~Sushi - they have several varieties or will make special rolls to order. ~ Grill station - you can watch them cook a handful of specialty items such as Scallion Pancakes, Short Ribs, Satay, Dumplings, etc.  They are always fresh and cooked to order, if needed.   ~ Noodle Bowl station - noodles in a delicious broth with many topping options. I haven't tried it, but my teenager loves it.   ~ Cold food station - Salad, Shrimp/Oysters, Fruit, etc ~ Desserts - there are two desserts stations!  Even a soft serve ice cream machine.  If you have a good appetite and are looking to splurge a bit...Tin Tin is your place!   Note:  I mention \"splurge\" because 3 of us went for dinner on Sat night, we ordered 1 hot tea and 2 cups for soda (free refills) and with tip, it was over $100!   In my opinion...it's was well worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this used to be one of my favorite places in Charlotte to eat. The food was good, the service was excellent. The last few times, not so much.  Let's talk about service first: - The seating took place relatively quickly - It took us 5 minutes to get our drinks ordered (acceptable) - It took 10 minutes to get the drinks (bordering on slow) - It took 15 minutes to get silverware and shell bowls (VERY slow for a buffet restaurant) - The dishes stacked up and up at the table. I actually looked at my watch to see how long it would be before we say a waitress for our SECTION of 9 tables. It was 15 minutes. They went to one table and it was another 5 minutes before we saw her again. Now to the food: The sushi was warm.. the crab legs were cold! Anybody see the problem here? In fact the crab legs I picked up, supposedly hot, were almost still frozen! At least two of the three clusters I got. The selection for sushi a year or so ago was significantly better.  I also had the buttered shrimp... okay The Hot and Sour Soup - No flavor at all. Seemed to be watered down. The ice cream machine was broken, so that was a bust. The fried chicken was okay. The sesame chicken lacked any sesame. The pieces were large not very flavorful. The clams lacked any flavor, along with the Thai Chicken. Overall... simply not a good outing. Needless to say, although this was a restaurant we went to on at least a monthly basis, we will be looking for a new Asian restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"This is the best of the best when it comes to Asian buffets.  And it's also just great food in general.  Their sushi is wonderful, not to mention the excellent and succulent crab legs.  There are lots of delicious selections to suit every taste.  And the staff is exceptionally friendly, cordial, and genuinely caring."}
{"text":"The buffet was amazing a ton of choices. This could be the best buffet I have ever been to. Will be back real soon"}
{"text":"Decided to try Tin Tin again after about 5 years being the last time I ate here. Hate to say it but it's still the same with a few minor additions to the overall menu. Food is still good but it's the same ol stuff. If you have never been you will like it. If you have been before, don't look forward to many changes on the buffet."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch which was a good price for this buffet-style Chinese restaurant. I've had better dim sum and dumplings in other Chinese buffets. The pork in the dumplings seemed to be more of a sausage flavor, much stronger and tougher than a more bland ground pork. Either that or they overcooked and used too much vinegar in the filling. But the sushi here was pretty good despite the lack of sushi options. The rest of the food seems fresh and they have plenty of soups, typical Chinese food, and some kid-friendly foods (mac and cheese, wings, etc.).   Not my favorite buffet but decent price for lunch and has some different options with the dim sum and dumplings here."}
{"text":"I'm not big on buffets because they tend to only have 3 or 4 items that i actually like but this has to be one of the best buffets I've been to in a long time. they have a large selection and the food is fresh. the customer service is also good, at the time I was pregnant so idk if the manager was being nice because of that or if he was truly nice but they treated us very well. i went for their lunch special which to my surprise had just as much as they have at night. i also liked the fact that the food was not over seasoned, dry or salty. I left full and happy. I would take friends and family here because its not expensive and there is something for everyone to eat. I've been to some Asian buffets and not been happy, i can honestly say I was a satisfied customer when i left.  One other thing I liked is the fact that they don't reheat or reuse food (or at least it seemed that way) and i say this because when lunch was over they let the employees have at what was left instead of throwing it away or trying to save it for dinner. Plus its nice that an employer cares enough about their employees to give them free lunch. I've worked in a restaurant before and we had to pay for everything. Happy employees means happy customers:)"}
{"text":"If I could rate this sh*t one star, I would.  My brother, who normally makes the BEST food recommendations, said that we HAD to visit this restaurant because it was \"seriously the best Chinese food you could ever have.\"  I should've known that this was a lie when he told me the name was Tin Tin. I ain't EVER in my Black a** life been to a Tin Tin that tasted worth a damn damn.  The second sign that this was gonna be a problem was when he said it was a buffet.  And I know what you're thinking. \"Girl, that should've been the FIRST warning. A Chinese buffet? You played yourself!\" But understand this: my brother is literally a foodie. When he says some food is delicious, you take his word for it. Until TODAY, he's never failed me but ON TODAY? I'm pissed.  Nothing was labeled, so unless you cooked it yourself or could easily identify it by sight, you had no clue what you were eating.  They serve raw oysters on a bar. Like the (obvious) dummy that I am, I tried one. It was extremely DRY. When I told the waiter this, he said \"there's no way it could've been dry. We crack these open fresh every day.\" I mean, okay, sir. The sh*t was still dry.  My sister got a piece of their sushi (tuna). It was so damn dry that when you tap the edges, it seriously kicked off the drum line to start some under the sea musical.   The general tso's chicken tastes like a salt lamp (don't ask me how I know what a salt lamp tastes like).  They had chicken and broccoli with no chicken.  The fried rice was dry.  The crawfish had zero signs of seasoning.  The shrimp (that they serve cold with cocktail sauce) tasted like muf*ckas felt when Prince died.  We saw them carrying a frozen bag of potstickers.  Like, y'all are Asian and you're taking the frozen route?  My God.  I could go on and on but ultimately, all of this is my fault. I haven't been to a Chinese buffet since college (35 Chinese in Chapel Hill, NC), so I dunno what made my 36 year old ass think that anythings changed.  Yelp needs to give an option for zero stars because one is just way too much!   PS: as I was walking out the door, I saw that their sanitation grade was a 90.  Jesus Christ I'm gonna die."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of buffets. Generally the food tends to be overpriced, unimpressive, too greasy, too salty, too laden with MSG. But you know.. Tin Tin is really pretty good.   The story here is that Tin Tin was owned by a Chinese couple and the food was wonderful. They sold it (or leased it?) to a Korean couple, and the quality of the food went down. Now the original couple has taken the restaurant back and everything has gotten better again. I was lamenting the lack of authentic Chinese food in Charlotte to a couple I met in DC who are actually from Atlanta. They told me the story of Tin Tin and said that it's one of their favorite restaurants. Well, with that kind of recommendation, I had to come try it.   We stopped in for lunch, and even during the late hours of lunch, the food was still fresh. This is important. You don't want the dregs! There were plenty of authentic Chinese dishes which were pretty decent. I try and stick to a veggie diet, and the vegetable options were plentiful. They had congee and Chinese donut, which is pretty awesome! It was just what I wanted. The soups looked good, so I may try those next time. They had a number of dim sum dishes in steamers, sushi choices, and pretty much any basic Chinese dish you'd like to eat. They have crab rangoon in weird triangles, but it just might be the best crab rangoon I've ever had.   Definitely recommend this place for lunch. Haven't been to dinner here yet, but I will definitely be back, so stay tuned... :)"}
{"text":"Tin Tin has reopened and returned to its former glory!  Look at the new buffet pictures! Plenty of food and great service! Please give them a try!  New managers are great and trying really hard."}
{"text":"Tin Tin is one of the best buffets you can get in the south and north carolinas in my opinion. The lunch buffet is pretty good but the service isn't as great because it's lunch. The dinner by far is the best especially on sundays because there are a lot of people. Yes, the weekend buffet is pretty pricey 20 bucks per person but it's worth it to eat all the crab, craw fish, and oysters you want! Also the mini pho line is awesome it's always constant tasting! I would recommend the dinner buffet to anyone!"}
{"text":"They get one star bc the waitress was good... the food ... cold and bland!! And way greasy!!  Food was cold, they do NOT bring fresh food out like they should. The sushi, or whatever that was, was gross.... I never seen so much sushi with cream cheese, bitter cream cheese. What I could manage to swallow was the Hot and sour soup, which was very tart, bad tart. The lo mein was beyond greasy.... don't get me wrong I LOVE Chinese buffet restaurants but this place is the WORST I been to and the most expensive.  Same your money... the local Harris Teeter has a better Chinese buffet & it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese buffet. Recently renovated, so looks decent inside. Has plenty of space, and a decent crowd on a Sunday night. The Sunday dinner buffet is $16-17, which is a bit towards the expensive side. They used to offer sushi, but have replaced it with hot pot ingredients station. It's probably a good thing since sushi at Chinese buffets tend not to be very good. Hot pot is an extra $3 add on per person, which seems like an okay deal given they do have seafood in the ingredients stand. They also serve made to order soup noodle bowls, and was serving some \"Peking\" duck. Both were edible, but not particularly good. As for the regular food selection, the selection was smaller than I thought, especially at the beginning when the best thing they had was raw oysters. They then started bringing out two types of blue crab dishes, and those were tasted good."}
{"text":"Too expensive for such mediocre food! I understand, that to some extent, that buffets generally don't put out 5 star food but there comes a point where the price you are paying is not worth the food. Even if you're going solely for the fresh seafood, in the end, (unless you are a marathon eater) there is no way you could possibly eat the value of food that you were being charged for. As a repeat customer from the past, even then the buffet was pricey but tolerated because of the fresh seafood. With the recent rise in price that is no longer the case."}
{"text":"Tin tin was a flop flop.  Mediocre Chinese on a limited buffet.  You won't find a hibachi chef who cooks for you here."}
{"text":"I am convinced that most people that take the time to write reviews of restaurants online have absolutely no idea what good food is.  They mistake quantity for quality.  They pour A1 on a $75 ribeye.  Thus chains like Applebee's, Golden Corral, and KFC remain in business.    Anyone that rates a Chinese buffet for more than 3 stars needs to stop writing online reviews.  Seriously.  Stop.    As buffets go, Tin Tin is average.  Yes, they have sushi and crab legs.  Oysters were not fresh, but I wouldn't say they had gone bad yet.  Sushi was akin to what you might find at Costco or Publix.  Others dishes were bland and there's something weird about their food warming stations.  You shouldn't have the steam fogging up the glass or turning the room into a sauna.    Do yourself a favor and go get some real sushi or Chinese food if that's what you're looking for.  Try Lee Cafe in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Ahhh buffets... pretty good I guess if you want to gorge yourself.  I wasn't totally in a buffet mood when I went, so needless to say I got a little grossed out by the aggressive behaviour going down around the steamed crab leg tray.  We went on a Sunday night, and it was swarmed with people, so they have got to be doing something right!  Tin Tin has a wide variety of chinese dishes, steamed crab legs and oysters, lots of shrimp, a sushi buffet, and the classic kiddy table with some french fries and mac and cheese, and an ice cream machine - which scores BIG points with me.  All that being said, I felt like everything I ate (except the ice cream) had a slick of oil over it.  The sushi table had some decent looking stuff on it, but I didn't dig in.   Will only return when I'm famished."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Tin Tin in a while but this was a double disappointment. Not only was the main course of food horrible, the desserts were too. I don't how you can get all the desserts wrong.   When grabbing your food it was a little uncomfortable because the steam is all up on you.   There weren't any real good options to choose from. They had a number of shrimp  but only about 2 different types of chicken.   All the food just did not look appealing  It was a waste of 30 dollars. The quality was just horrible.   The only thing that was fine was the service for our drinks."}
{"text":"I give this place a sold 3.5 stars but since i can't give half a star, I'm putting down 4. I don't understand why the ratings are so low for this place. I come from California,  a place of many amazing buffets and Tin Tin, while its not humongous has plenty to offer and the price isn't bad.    The selection of food is good and the quality is pretty good.  The sushi is decent and so glad it's just not California rolls.  The last few times my family and I have visited Charlotte, we've included Tin Tin on our list so everyone can have what they want.    A few things i wish they would include are vermicelli noodles for the soups and crab legs.  I'm willing to pay 29 a person if it included good crab legs.    Again this isn't the number 1 buffet in the world but between South Carolina and North Carolina.. it's good."}
{"text":"Absolutely POINTLESS with NO CRAB LEGS just another underwhelming Asian buffet with mediocre at best food"}
{"text":"My ultimate demise occurred when I entered the doors of Tin Tin Buffet. I pass this place on the way to work everyday and have always thought \"Oh I bet that place is DOPE.\" I ended up on this side of town early and decided to drop in and try it out.  I got the Thai chicken - meh. The rice was \"ok\". This would have been fine had they not charged me over $25 for the plate. Folks, it was crab leg night. No one informed me of the cost. When I told them that I did not indulge in said crab legs they said \"doesn't matter\".   Let me reiterate - I paid over $25 for sub par Asian cuisine. I made my selection because everything else looked dismal at best.  Yes, one might argue, \"Britt, you didn't ask the price. Yeah,ok, rando, no I didn't. I'm aware that this is ultimately all my fault.   I just want to warn all of you - once like me - naive and vulnerable in my hungered state: Don't go to Tin Tin unless you plan on eating crab legs until you barf.  My name is Brittany and I paid over twenty bones for a sub par plate of Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I would put no star if have this option here on yelp. Me and my husband eat here once and a while, and we have noticed the quality of food has been going down. Last night we spent almost $60, with tip, and decided not to return again. The place does not look very clean. I watched a lady open a big box of strawberries and put them out without washing them, and on the box was written \"wash before eating.\" The quality of the food was not worth it. This has always been a buffet, and now the quality has become what you would expect to receive in a typical \"cheap\" buffet. Also, later last night both of us got a little bit of stomach sickness."}
{"text":"As usual the buffet was good.  However they no longer have crab legs on it.  You can order them with an extra charge of $15 per lb."}
{"text":"For $19.95, I would not come back again. Very unusual selection, this includes chicken feet, pig hocks, beef tendon, age egg congee and brick size water boil tofu.  Many items in the buffet bar are items you would find in a Chinese dim sum restaurant, but all are either dry up or been steam so long that they become tasteless.  The most popular item would be the steam/water boil snow crab legs, but too bad, I'm not a big fan of them."}
{"text":"Tin tin? ... I use to be a faithful customer . But after today & after hearing that they reopen I was more than excited to go back . I tried their food today & it was so much different than their normal .The food was cold and not very satisfying .. I was upset .  The spicy pho soup was NOT the same,&  it taste very fishy . It's very sad the fact their food is disgusting . I went on a SUNDAY & they are normally very BUSY but it was slow and barely anyone in there . To remind you the price is still 25$ per person . NOT WORTH IT ! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME . If I could rate them without stars .. They don't even deserve 1 star! I'm sorry , I truly use to love them and their service but you can't reopen and comeback like this . That's just horrible ... Sucks that we don't have a very good buffet in Charlotte . They use to be the spot every Sunday's for me & my family . & I won't be coming back!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"Oh my god,  this place is huge.\"  \"Dude! They'll totally have veggie stuff. They have like, a million things.\" .....  5 minutes and a plate full of white rice, french fries, futo maki and the two pieces of Thai Stuffed Tofu that were out on the buffet later... we were feeling a little sad. And a little ripped off.  I don't write a lot of these cranky vegetarian reviews -- I understand that there are places you just shouldn't expect cowtowing to the non-normal-no-animal-products crowd. Tin Tin, however, has so much potential... and it would be so easy... that I gotta whine.   Lo mein and fried rice. So simple and tasty. Here, there were several (8?) options - shrimp fried, pork fried, beef lo mein, etc. If even one of the noodle dishes here was veg friendly, I would have been stoked. But no.   Sushi. There was a large, impressive selection... but there weren't even avocado/cuke rolls. One plate of Futo Maki (wrapped in that new fangled dyed soy sheet crap rather than seaweed, ack) was all that was to be seen.  Soup. Negative. Even the hot n sour claimed to have pork in it, but I ate some anyway after fishing thru the vat for 5 minutes and seeing nada. This was the only other dish in the entire buffet (other than the stuffed Tofu previously mentioned) that contained tofu.  The sauteed Bok and Lok Choy were delicious, and I ended up stuffing my face with mostly them-- slightly salty, just a hint of garlic, still crisp at center.  Green beans were overdone.  So please, Tin Tin gods... all you gotta do is stick veggie fried rice, Garlic Tofu or something, and maybe an interesting, veg soup out there... and you've got me. For lunch anyway. Dinner prices (at $16.99) are a little out of my crab-legs-less range."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place , food was OK for a buffet. Didn't expect great food........or cockroaches crawling on the wall next to the hot food! When I told a server he just said \"oh ok\"......disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Tin Tin has gone downhill over the past years. Food not as tasty and diverse as it once was, and many items were not hot, even though I was there at the lunch hour peak. The iced tea tasted like instant. For $12, I expect better."}
{"text":"I like this place. The wait may be long at times but my family and I think it's worth it! They have a great variety and they're clean. The wait staff is not always as friendly but It's buffet! Live 2.5 hours away but when we go to charlotte we usually always make a stop here!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Tin Tim sooner! I've been going here for years! Tin Tin is the BEST Asian buffet in Charlotte! I say Asian because you get much more than the standard Chinese fare. You can try authentic Chinese dim sum, Korean BBQ, Vietnamese noodle soup, crawfish, crab legs, Singapore noodles, an assortment of desserts, and sushi!! Whoa! It does not get better than this! I must say, the moment you see Asian families lined up outside tr door...waiting for the establishment to open...you know the place is legit! The food is fresh, the buffet is clean, and you will never run out of beautiful fresh crab legs like at most buffets!"}
{"text":"Ok by now everyone knows I don't really like Chinese food but my hunni bun does so I push through and just find at least one thing I don't mind eating on the menu. with that being said hers comes the problem with Tin Tin. The business has been taken over by new ownership and I don't think the current owners have changed the website to show what they now offer. So if you go to the website you see crab legs as well as Sushi. Big problem here I was sold on those being my indulgent since I didn't really see any other things I liked. To my surprise after getting there, there was no crab legs and no sushi. I was so out done that I was deceived and now have to put together food which consisted of my basically eating shrimp and egg rolls when were at a full buffet. My guy ate but admitted that he has had much better Chinese as well as my brothers girl friend who said the same thing. I was really disappointed. I will not be visiting again just not up my alley. I really hate to take away from the things that other ppl love about the business its just that in the past ppl salivated when they spoke of this establishment especially the crab legs."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill the wuality of the food sucks.  Went on Sunday about 11:15 a little after they just opened thought we would get some fresh food but the had the steamers on so high warming up left overs.  Very disappointed this will be the last time.  Also had the pleasure of looking at this soy sauce bottle very filthy!!"}
{"text":"I used to go here when I was a kid.  It now is awful. Very overpriced and the seafood tastes disgusting."}
{"text":"Great variety of food.  Very poor quality. All the hot buffet items were COLD. I did enjoy the Peking duck.    The dinner price was $23 per person with no option to avoid the costly crab legs and other sea food.   Go to Tin Tin if you enjoy very expensive cold below average Chinese buffet food."}
{"text":"We've been going for years. I love their sticky rice with mango, all you can eat pho soup, sushi and seafood, fried banana and variety of meat and veggies. Wish they could have my favorite fried smaller crabs."}
{"text":"Our table included 2 humans and 1 cockroach. Eew! Don't sit in the patio room - super dirty and full of pests. The manager on duty swears that they have pest control but none of the waitresses acted surprised when we said that there was a cockroach on our table. This was not a palmetto bug but a legitimate roach! Nasty."}
{"text":"I wanted so CRAB LEGS! No longer has Crab Legs on the Buffet.  You can order them separately for $15 per pounds. I won't be back until someone writes a review and indicates Crab Legs are back on the buffet."}
{"text":"Okay...there are some people that LOVE this place. My review aside, it's always packed....not sure why, but it is so take my one star with a grain of salt I guess. If you love all you can eat crab legs, this is your place. If not, stay far away....FAR AWAY.  Tired hostess, angry server and food that tasted like it came out of the dumpster. I've eaten everywhere....bad food, good food, authentic.....everything and this was hands-down the worst. Trust me....I wouldn't change a thing if i was the owner due to the constant traffic, but be warned. That's why I stopped in. $50 is kinda steep for two too, but it was worth the story I guess. Pig slop would be too kind."}
{"text":"I don't do Chinese food buffets anywhere, but I must say this is some of the best chinese/Asian food I've had outside my NYC home. The butter shrimp, chicken and broccoli, crab legs, sushi...incredible! I'll be back...SOON!"}
{"text":"First, keep in mind that IT IS an Asian Buffet which includes Crab Legs, and you don't have to drive to the beach and pay over $30 per person for the same style buffet. Definitely the best one around Charlotte.  If you like the smell of your own brand then you probably won't like it and give it one or two stars and some hater styled review because your upset about the crab leg buffet price, I think it's about $25 per person with sweet tea or soda/pop.  But for all you military and ex military guys who have suffered through years of MRE's and chow hall food, or anybody that is a self proclaimed 'buffet slayer' this place is the bombshiznizzlesnipsnapsandwich brother!  I LOVE crab legs and this place scratches that itch with a resounding... Outstanding!  So go with an open mind and a gigantic appetite, and leave the unrealistic expectations in your stained undies at home(you can sniff 'em later), the place is always packed so you know the food is fresh and not been sitting there since last tuesday.  Don't go if your an uptight, picky fart sniffer. Or think that Vegas is the only place you would eat a buffet, Vegas is overrated and the only reason the food there is great is because 99.9% of the patrons are drunk as skunks. Vegas looks great at night but in the daylight it's on par with a third world combat zone!   Tin Tin is just plain worth it and will always have my vote with a smile and two thumbs up! :-)"}
{"text":"I decided to try Tin Tin because if you want authentic Chinese go where those of Asian descent go.  I went on a Saturday afternoon taking a break from Christmas shopping. Just like most Chinese buffets I have been to there were the standard Americanized dishes.  But there were also some more authentic dishes (please don't take my word for this as I am a middle aged fat white man who probably doesn't know what authentic Chinese dishes are).  Tin Tin had sushi, not a fan, so I didn't try it, so I can't rate it.  A grill, with chicken satay and other grilled offerings. A noodle soup station which unfortunately I didn't try.  About 25% of the dishes were seafood including shrimp, mussels, and fish.  The also had traditional American fare such as chicken nuggets and french fries.  I can't speak to the authenticity of the dishes, but those I tried were hot and very good, which for a buffet is an important thing to me.  The service was very good, clearing the empty dishes and keeping my glass full.  The price was a little higher than most buffets, but Tin Tin has a lot more to offer than most other Chinese buffets.  If you like Americanized Chinese dishes, then Tin Tin might not be for you.  If you are adventurous and like to try new things, then definitely give Tin Tin a try."}
{"text":"Disgusting and over priced. I should've known when I walked in and saw how dirty the floors were. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"For the most part the experience was good. The staff was super friendly, they had a huge variety, the place was reasonably clean, the food was good I thought for the most part and the price was as expected. Two adults and two kids had the lunch buffet and a pound of crabs for around $50ish. My kids enjoyed it so I would go back."}
{"text":"This is only a value at dinner if you plan to eat your face off with their delicacies: oysters, snow crab legs, crawfish, and more snow crab legs.  Otherwise, the $20 dinner price doesn't cut it for me.  I didn't venture for any sushi, but they did have some sashimi.  They had some unique dishes (from an American perspective), but then the only lo mein I found was shrimp?  Everything we ate was pretty good (we even went for it with the snow crab legs, but I think they're too much work!) and they have soft serve ice cream to finish it off.  Prompt service with clearing plates and refilling my tea, which I appreciate.  Maybe I would feel it's more of a value at lunch, but without an interest in their most popular items, I wouldn't be back for dinner (especially with a 30 minute was despite MAJOR rain downpour)."}
{"text":"Chinese buffets are my guilty pleasure, but there are so many awful ones    that I only try those with great reviews - like Tin Tun. And I have to say I have no clue what's behind these 4 star reviews unless people are confusing quantity with quality. This place has that - big selection. And that's about it.  Well, its clean too.   I'm sure I didn't get this place at its best as it was 2:00 PM and they were refilling dishes only randomly, and preparing to close at 3:00.  Most of the food was remarkably tasteless. Sushi rolls (freshly made it seemed) were tasteless. Even the spicy tuna roll which was hardly distinguishable from a snapper roll or a plain tune roll. Spring rolls - tasteless. Most of the dumplings - tasteless.   Some of the entree's were OK. Salmon in black bean was actually pretty good, as was the General Tso's. There was some sort of spicy chicken that was good too. The noodles - Singapore and Lo Mein - weren't terrible but fairly bland.   Maybe dinner time is better - the sushi chef was making some interesting looking things that were for the dinner buffet. And presumably crab legs, oysters, etc. are at dinner only because they weren't there at lunch.   And there's enough variety that you could certainly piece together a decent meal but you'd have to try quite a bit of tasteless stuff in the process.   Wasn't expecting magnificence, and was still pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"In terms of finding an authentic Chinese buffet, Tin Tin is the place! This is definitely not your typical Chinese buffet, they have dishes that you would find at Dim Sum like chicken feet, sticky rice  steamed in lotus leaves, chow fun, etc...they also have a great soup bar. The only down side is their mediocre sushi. Your not going to like Tin Tin if your looking for the typical chineses buffet."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and always saw the parking lot filled so we gave it a try. We went in for lunch but most of the food was blah. Some of the sushi was ok. It did not seem super clean. So we tried the food and asked about the snow crab. Oh we changed new owners and no more snow crab. We have king crab but we do not put out until dinner. So ok, a lesson learned. Then after we pay, Stu come the snow crab. WHAT? So we wound up spending like 60.00 for lunch that would have cost us 30.00 in a regular restaurant and I did not get the one thing I went to a buffet for. I will not be going back"}
{"text":"If you love crab legs this is the place to go, only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the beverage price for a soft drink it's almost $6.00 but overall great place."}
{"text":"For the price, definitely not worth it. While they do offer crab legs (dinner only), I found that everything from the crab legs to the other sea food offered didn't taste fresh. It had that \"fishy\" smell and aftertaste. The other food wasn't good either - stale rice, noodles. There was some Mac and Cheese that looked just gross - a little left in the pan all dried up on the sides. Even at the beginning of the dinner hour, they didn't bring out fresh, hot food. There just wasn't much of anything to choose from.  The sushi didn't taste fresh. The crab legs were tiny and the outer shell was soft instead of hard and fresh. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Tin Tin is not quite as good as it used to be but it is still a great place to get authentic Asian food. Thy have plenty of Americanized Asian food but the good stuff here is authentic Asian food such as made to order soup, duck bao and chicken feet in black bean sauce. If you like the real deal, this place is recommended."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I would have given 4.5 Stars.   But now... They don't do Sushi anymore, which is a disappointment because despite their chef not knowing how to cut sashimi they had a decent Spread.  They no longer have been sprout and seaweed salad. No longer have ceviche. They decreased the noodle options, they don't have as many dumpling and fried food pastries any more.  They claimed they were closed to remodel for even better foods but when we came in on reopen all the food tasted like chemicals from unseasoned new kitchen appliances.   The first time I came by it became my favorite buffet but now I'll probably never go back."}
{"text":"I am sad to have to write this review but this used to be my favorite Chinese Buffet. I went there last night with my 2 children after not having been there for over a year.  I will never go back to this restaurant unless there is a change in ownership.  Why was it so bad?  1.  All of the servers looked miserable.  Our server was surly and down right hostile to us for no particular reason.  I guess she hated her job and she wanted us to know it? 2.  The cost of the meal was $68 for 3 people and not worth the money. 3.  The food was nothing special and some of the food was cold.  Were they saving electricity by letting the food grow cold?    I spoke to one of my friend ( who also used to go here on a weekly basis) about this and she agreed with me on all points.  Something is seriously wrong with this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese buffet in the Charlotte area, but that's not saying much. This place is almost always packed, so expect a long wait - more than an hour at peak times.  Very large restaurant with a lot of seating, look out for the hidden stairs that seem to be everywhere. I'm not sure why they decided to add that little complication, but they did. Really handy when you're carrying a plate of food and a bowl of soup.  Sushi, always my first stop, was fresh. One area of rolls and another of fish, it was being made right there and there was plenty of it. Eel, salmon, tuna, plus sashimi in some sort of sauce. Not a very wide variety, I'm afraid. The holder with hand rolls only had one eel the whole time I was there.  There's a soup bar (I think that's what it was) where you can have the chef add your stuff to it and he cooks it up right there. There's also a grill nearby which is turning out fresh dumplings and grilled tofu and some other stuff.  The steam tables were always stocked and not just with the Americanized Chinese food. There were quite a few more authentic options, including some strange looking cuts of beef and chicken that I've not seen elsewhere in Charlotte. And the usual Pork Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and the Crawfish that everyone seems to like (though I don't!). Of course, french fries and fried potatoes and cheese sticks and even tacos!  Lots of wait staff, so drinks are always refilled and dirty plates are picked up quickly.  Would I come here again? Maybe on the weekend when I am willing to wait. The non-crab legs hours seem to be a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"We came back for lunch tofay after a 2 months break from bad, old, over cook food at Tin Tin, we decided to give them another opportunity today. We are extremely happy and the reason is.. the old Chef is back!!! Tell your friends to come back, they have new owner and chef. Today's food was amazing, fresh and delicious like it was before 2016."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised this only has three stars. I enjoy eating here, the food is always fresh and never runs out. The restrooms are clean. My only complaint is that they charge three yr olds to eat. My son eats a small amount of white rice and Chinese doughnuts, I'm already paying $10 on the weekday to eat, can't we get away with a serving of rice for the little one ?"}
{"text":"I would give it 4 stars bc you can't beat unlimited crab legs but seriously the price keeps going up every time. It's now 24.95 for dinner on the weekend I believe. Sushi has gotten better than before. I like the grill station and the oyster. Their dim sum selection is pretty decent too. The staff is a hit or missed. Been going here for years and I wouldn't say it's getting bad but not better either. I will say I never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"Well I am dragged into another Buffet for lunch. I do not like buffets, they scare me and usually the food is very average. Tin Tin is a very average looking establishment with your basic Chinese buffet decor.   I was taken up to the serving area to a soup station. Here you pick out your choice of noodles, ingredients and sauce. They quickly cook the noodles and prepare the product right before your eyes. The soup serving is huge and it was delicious. Great curry based sauce.   Now there is this massive H shaped buffet with all kinds of choices. I have never seen anything like this. I ended up going back three times to sample as much as I could. Lots of meat dishes, vegetables and a nice seafood selection.   They offer a Sushi bar and a large salad bar as well as dessert bar. The Sushi is very average.  This restaurant is a good price/value. $13 for the buffet, drink and tip.  I think $10 would make it an excellent price/value, after all you cannot possibly sample the many dishes in one visit. From the other reviews it appears that dinner might have even more selections. I will definitly be back for another lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Tin Tin is one of those places for when you don't know where else to eat so you just go there. The food is not anything extraordinary but it's not completely horrible. The customer service ranges: sometimes it's good (not super good) and sometimes it's not good. The sushi has gotten worse over the years. The rice is too thick and the fish doesn't taste fresh. The only thing I look forward to is the shark fin soup. It's my favorite dish served there. If you do go, definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Everything sucks .. don't have variety of food and no good seafood  no beer  expensive for that service"}
{"text":"Tin Tin has been a good restaurant for us.  I think sometimes it gets a bad rap because the waiters are always very busy and can come off as rude. It slightly just comes with the territory, I think. This place is always packed for a reason. If you can realize that the waiters are not being rude to you personally/directly, then I think you'll have a great experience. The food is good. There's plenty to choose from and considering there is endless crab legs, the price is very fair.  I recommend Tin Tin to my friends."}
{"text":"If you can eat, you'll love it here. This is the best place for snow crab legs because there's always plenty, they're not over cooked, and very hot. I love the oysters here because they're not cheap, they constantly put out about 40 at a time. When you catch them in season, they even have persimmons. Korean short rib is good and they have fish maw soup as well.   What I don't like though is that their prices can be very high on holidays and they've even raised their prices a few times. But after a few plates of crab, oysters, and persimmons, all your money comes back. The waitresses have no emotion and you can tell the boss is mean. The wait is very long and they're always overly crowded during dinner.  Decor is great, even for a buffet, not many restaurants in general have granite countertops. The bathrooms are clean and are located at two sides of Tin Tin. This is definitly the place to bring our out of town friends and family to experience.  I'm not sure but I believe they dont take reservations, that's why everyone has to wait over an hour."}
{"text":"I should have went with my gut feeling when deciding on lunch today and should have gone to Wan Fu instead of Tin Tin.  Next time I'll know better.  First the pros:  - The place was huge as others have mentioned with many different options:  sushi, freshly cooked meets, custom made soups. - The food looked appetizing  The Cons:  -  The food had no flavor.  It was all quite bland with no seasonings at all. -  The food was either over sauced or dried out from sitting under heat lamps too long. -  It took forever to get our drink order in. -  It took forever to get our checks because we apparently had 3 people waiting on us and none of them knew what the other was doing. -  I attempted to try the vegetarian sushi options.  The wasabi wasn't even close to being hot.   - The place had an odd smell to it that got in my lungs and made it difficult to breathe. - $8.95 for below average food?  really?  The best things I had here were the hot and sour soup which was average at best and an almond cookie that was probably store bought.  Everything else was a bust.  But I guess the good thing was that I didn't stuff myself."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm home for the holidays, I can always look forward to my reacquaintance with Tin Tin.  I typically go on a weekday for lunch, when the price tag at $8.95 is much more palatable than the roughly doubled dinner price.  All in all, Tin Tin is a great rendition of the ubiquitous chinese buffet.    As a big fan of sushi, my go-to chinese buffet has to have a respectable offering.  If you're a sushi snob, you're not gonna be overwhelmed, but you'll usually do a lot worse elsewhere.  At the very least, you can count on a good selection beyond the boring staples of california and philadelphia rolls, with about 6 different nigiri presentations including eel, snapper and salmon, another half-dozen rolled forms with many of the same fish, and a bonus offering of spicy salmon sashimi and eel hand rolls (usually, although offerings may vary day-to-day).    My favorite hot item is probably the thick rice noodles (pad kee mao type), which may not satisfy a thai craving, but is yummy nonetheless.  My biggest complaint is that this is one of the few items Tin Tin seems to rotate out, usually for singaporean noodles which I find to be incredibly \"meh\".  That and the fact that the dessert leaves a lot to be desired are the reasons I took off a star.  Otherwise, I also enjoy the butter shrimp with a salty fried exterior, the thai chicken with a yummy mix of sweet and spiciness, pork dumplings, and cream cheese puffs.  The sesame chicken will kick you in the teeth with an almost cloying amount of sweetness, but I generally mix in a couple pieces to complement a milder accompaniment, like fried rice or lo mein.  Try a piece of everything and find something you like, cause Tin Tin does not lack for selection.  If you've never been a fan of the chinese buffet, this place will probably not make you a convert, but otherwise I recommend giving it a go during lunch time and hoping they've got those rice noodles."}
{"text":"Tin Tin is definitely the most authentic Chinese buffet I've been to.  There is very limited American Chinese dishes so if you're looking for an authentic buffet place, this is the restaurant to check out!  There is all-you-can-eat crab legs, clams, mussels, made-to-order noodle soup, sushi, and a few dim sum dishes (just to name a few).  Not to mention their wide selection of fruits and desserts. I always eat more than my stomach can hold but I always make sure I leave a little room for dessert.   We always bring our family friends here who live in larger cities and they always complement on how good the place is!  The weekends and holidays are always packed so if you choose to come during these times, expect to wait for a table!"}
