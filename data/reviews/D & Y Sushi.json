{"text":"Was very apprehensive about this place after I read lots of mediocre reviews after it first opened.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, at the quality of the sushi and I've been back multiple times.  Sushi has a good rice to filling ratio, and the rolls are generously sized.  Fish is the right temperature too.  Bento boxes are great and my 2.5 year old ate all of his chicken teriyaki, which is an accomplishment for any restaurant.  Pushed my luck one night and ordered a cocktail, which was pretty mediocre, so save your cockail $$ for the Passenger down the street :).  Decor is lovely and the place felt pretty clean with very friendly service.  A nice eat-in option and a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'm  glad there is a nice sushi place around  my area. I have been there a couple of times and I have always left satisfied.  The sushi rolls are nice and good portions. I have tried California  rolls, dynamite and teriyaki."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and just tried this place for take-out a few weeks ago. I'm just a regular guy who likes sushi, and not some kind of expert, but I was not disappointed. Not life-changing or anything, but also not bad. Tasty, fresh, the staff are very nice, a little pricey (but everything around here is)."}
{"text":"Decide to try out this restaurant on a long weekend. Was planning to have a nice dinner with gf. First the server couldn't really understand English so it took forever to get the order. Then, one of the appetizer was \"sold out\". After that, the food came except the vegetarian sushi.. Waited and waited finally the owner came and said they ran out of rice. I asked  her how can a sushi restaurant ran out of rice?! Anyway, they didn't suggest any other menu item and was not very apologetic  about it.  So we asked for the bill, they charged us for the sold out appetizer and we had to remind them that the appetizer was sold out and never got it. There are dozens of good sushi restaurants in the area, I definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this new sushi restaurant in the neighbourhood. we love Lan sushi, but it's not really a sit-down dinner place.  the food was good - not incredible, but fresh enough and tasty.   one thing we thought was not good was that miso soup and salad doesn't come with the combos (only with bento boxes)-from our sushi experience, this is unusual. Also, the bento boxes are not the 'usual' boxes that are served at sushi restaurants. Just not what you expect - but not in the \"wow! not what I expected!\" kind of way, more in the \"there are certain things that make you feel good about paying certain amounts in restaurants and some of these are missing\" kind of way.  service was great."}
{"text":"Great sushi - flavourful, fresh and delicious. Decent wine selection that extends beyond just one white and one red. Nice vibe. Haven't been disappointed once yet, and already visited at least 5 times and ordered out a few! It's nice to have a sit-down sushi resto option in the neighbourhood. God job, D & Y!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is decent. It is not as good as Lan sushi was, they don't use enough rice on their sushi rolls and their avocado roll is overpriced. It is nice to have a sushi place in the Junction though."}
{"text":"Decided to give them a try based on a recommendation. Great sushi.  The fish was fresh, the rolls are made to order and with care. The staff were attentive and helpful.  I was illegally parked out front in the dead of winter and they brought my order out to the car when it was ready.  The prices are higher than expected for the area and for the amount of food but it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  The galbi is the best in the city.  I have tried to find better but none can compare! The service is very good.  The servers are attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"First time checking out this restaurant and our family enjoyed a weekend dinner here.  Entrees ordered included bento boxes, teriyaki and ramen.  Service is genuine, earnest and prompt; we never felt untended to.  Portion sizes were standard; satiating and not overboard.  Food tasted flavourful; just mmm mmms all around.  Being a bento box lover, I did notice that there aren't as many options as most Japanese restaurants do have.  I also found it strange that there wasn't a non-raw eater option as all boxes came with sashimi...problem solved as I gave away my pieces!  We'd return as it's in the neighbourhood.  But too bad about the limited delivery range as we are just beyond the boundaries!"}
{"text":"After my second visit to D & Y sushi, I've decided that I'm not going back. The place seems like a front for some other business, quite frankly. The atmosphere/decor is thrown together and generic. There are rarely many customers, so the staff all congregate in a booth near the back of the restaurant, tapping on their cell phones. So you're in a random, empty sushi restaurant. Once you finally get seated and get a menu in your hands, you then get hit with oddly high prices. Doing a quick online menu comparison, D & Y sushi is totally on par price-wise with high-end Toronto sushi restaurants such as Yuzu no Hana and Fune. Even more perplexing is that none of the main sushi rolls are accompanied by miso soup and salad. Those have to be ordered separately, adding up to an additional $7.  The staff are more attentive towards their cell phones than they are to you. Once it gets late enough in the evening (after 9pm), they are all served dinner in their booth from a big bowl of food that looks way more delicious that what you've just been served. They will not be moved from their table while eating, even if you and the only other table of people in the place are waiting to pay your bill. I guess the food tasted good enough, which is why I'm giving one star."}
{"text":"The menu is annoying as are the prices. The sushi was mediocre at best. The boat we ordered didn't come on a boat. They had no hot sake, though the cold  sake list looked good.  Beer is list is dog shit. Waiter was pretty useless and too many white people for an Asian place.  Fuck that stupid menu!"}
{"text":"From the second I walked in the door, this place felt the most authentic, everything from the smell to the decor. The noise level made the meal enjoyable,my server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was ridiculously good, and the portions fair. I especially liked that unlike another sushi place my wife likes the sushi here didn't fall apart when dipped in soy sauce. There is however limited parking given they are on a main street,luckily they are right on a bus route(keel bus) The restaurant doesn't have wifi, but I was able to pick up a signal from the BMO next door. This was an overall amazing experience definitely will be heading back before the end of summer as the menu was just that intriguing. And I want to check out the selection at the bar."}
{"text":"We just left the place up the street where we got ignored. Walked in here, two people jumped up to greet us.  Manager suggested something for my son and got us drinks. Have been here before and the sushi is very fresh."}
{"text":"This place is quite nice. Had lunch here with a couple of my colleagues, where I ordered I Chicken Katsu bento, and they ordered a Sushi combo. The sushi was made delicately with the right amount for 1 person. Similarly, the Chicken Katsu bento filled me up just right. The chicken katsu was fried just right, the meat was still tender with a nice crisp to the exterior. The spring rolls that came along with the bento were also as delicious as any veggie spring roll could be.   Aside from the food, one thing that really made me enjoy my time here was the service. Our waiter was extremely polite, and was very friendly.   Only downside is that the prices are a bit more on the expensive side, but other than that this was definitely a great experience."}
{"text":"Good portions. Staff was super friendly. Came in right before it was about to close and they went out of their way to make sure I had a good experience without the guilt of keeping the kitchen open (sorry fellas).   It's a new business and it looks like it. Everything was super clean, including the bathrooms (a big tell of how clean the kitchen is). Prices were reasonable. Not the best best sushi you can get - but it's new and I expect it to grow.   Their maki was way better than their nigiri."}
{"text":"This area really needs more sushi so I was quite happy that this place came about. Overall my feeling is that it was mediocre at best - and I was a little annoyed that they don't have proper A.C.   I got one sushi combination and one maki combination. The fish portion was fine. The taste was OK. The price was a bit on the pricier side - but cheap enough that it isn't worth a TTC token ride out of the junction. The crispy part of the maki rolls were OK. The rice wasn't warm (my pet peeve) but it was tasted like just regular rice? It was a bit confusing but non-sushi experts may not even care.  The alcohol menu was a bit weird but they did have some nice cold sake and cold beer.   Service was good but it was kind of dead!   I hope they stay."}
{"text":"The sushi is quite good but the service can be slow sometimes and it is very pricey for what you get.  Unlike most Japanese places that give you miso soup and salad for free when you order rolls, this place does not. So you end up paying a lot for not too much food. I feel like this could be an effect of not getting enough business, but they'd get more business for me if there was more bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"The sushi was a bit pricey and the service was a bit slow. I was craving sushi the other day and decided to check this place out. I ordered the Red Dragon Roll for take-out and it took a while for the workers to make the dish. There were only three people working and there no other customers inside the restaurant. The place was a bit dark and felt a bit eerie. There was also no wifi here. However, when I came home and ate my meal, it was delicious! There was a perfect amount of avocado and cucumbers inside the roll. The packaging was also well-done and looked very appealing."}
{"text":"D & Y Sushi is a solid sushi place! The food comes out fast and fresh and at a reasonable price! Restaurant is new and clean and the staff are very friendly! Great place in a great neighbourhood! I would definitely come back again!   First time here today: I ordered the TNT sushi rolls which comes in 10 pieces. It's a D & Y Sushi special. Basically a roll with smoked salmon, unagi, oba and cream cheese, then deep fried. It was a burst of flavours. I can't say I would order this again just because I felt like the cream cheese really overpowered the taste of the sushi. But if you love cream cheese, this one's for you! On another note, the sushi here has a lot more filling than rice. I prefer a bit more rice on my sushi, but if you like lots of filling, this place is for you!  My companion also ordered the yakiniku which is on their Daily Lunch Specials menu. It was a bento box that came with some braised beef, a salad, assorted tempura and some sushi rolls of your choice: california or salmon. If you don't specify which roll you want, you'll unfortunately get california like my friend did. I didn't get a picture but it was and looked very tasty and appetizing!   We decided to go with just water for today but they did have a good selection of sakes and alcoholic beverages. Will definitely come back for a try! The water was great tho. By far, the best water I have ever had in my entire life. It was ice cold (with little to no ice!) and nice and crisp. Simply wonderful.   To add, the place isn't very busy so it's the perfect place to settle down with a couple friends to unwind and really enjoy the food. They played some nice traditional Japanese music too.   Food comes out quick and is fresh as hell.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurante is clean and the service is good. There is no AYCA but the size of portions are okay and price is fine too. Some of the food I didn't like the taste, different than I usually eat in other places, but still not bad."}
{"text":"This place is always empty so I wasn't sure what it would be like.  Wanted to give a positive review for others to see so it will stay open.  I like that there is a sit down sushi place in the neighbourhood.  We got the small boat.  Didn't come on a boat but it was delicious.  It came on a lazy Susan instead, which was pretty handy. Veggie Dragon roll is a superior roll compared to options elsewhere.  The Caterpillar roll had nice pieces of salmon.   First floor bathroom. The music was a little Dance Mix 2013 so not really up my alley or what I expect for a sushi date but that's really my only constructive feedback."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I was really surprised by the grilled squid...which was tasty, crispy and flavorful considering the fact that it was not deep fried or sauced.  The sushi is standard, the atmosphere is chilled and the service is quick. It doesn't seem like it would handle a big rush well though...management should think about that.  I don't think this place deserves a 1 star rating and maybe I'm giving a generous 4 stars to bring that rating up...  It's worth checking out at least..."}
