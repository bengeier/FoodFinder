{"text":"So this was a converted property...less than a year old since Marriott's purchase.  Great service, particularly in the new concierge lounge (open since Dec. 2012).  Renovations look well done, but be prepared for small rooms and worn carpeting.  Overall, I'd stay here again primarily because of the service (and lower price vs. the airport Marriott).  Clean, comfortable, etc...your average Marriott trying to be European, but the folks there really do try hard and want you to come back.  Why stay there....because it's downtown, service is fantastic and price.  Why stay somewhere else...because you want to be outside downtown or you're your a Starwood Platinum."}
{"text":"The Renaissance Phoenix Downtown is definitely the place to stay while downtown. We spent two nights (Fri & Sat) while attending the Supercross event. I had contacted the hotel via the web site asking about motorcycle parking and received a prompt reply from Stephanie. Although they won't valet park motorcycles (I wouldn't want them to anyway). However, Stephanie did coordinate with the valet crew to allow me to park complementary in their garage. I pulled into the garage off of 1st St, and Daniel opened the ramp gate for us and showed us to our spot.

Brian at the check-in desk was great and got us into our room right away. The room on the 10th floor was clean and well furnished. An added bonus was the audio/video port behind the TV. A great idea to make use of my gadgets. You'll need to pay for wifi access, unless you're a Rewards member (just be sure to ask for the access code).

The maids were great and very accommodating when we asked for more coffee. The bed was comfortable, as were the couch and chairs. The carpet, furniture, bathroom were all clean and stocked with the typical hotel supplies. There was plenty of lighting and outlets were easy to find for the power strip I brought but didn't need thanks to the audio/video port.

A very friendly staff and this hotel will be on my list for next year's Supercross stay."}
{"text":"Great hotel. Travel a lot on weekends for sports and this was by far, our favorite hotel in a long time. Gordon greeted us, gave  tips for restaurants & stores nearby. Everyone in our group ended up discussing the wonderful Gordon. Great people as you arrive really do make the difference! 

Rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet. Food in both bar & restaurant was delicious. 

The only disappointment was the hotel pool. Very small and out of place for such a gorgeous hotel."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We mobile checked in early and when we showed up, they upgraded us for free to a suite! Also gave us free wi-fi! Very clean and every amenity you can think of. Rooftop balcony with heated pool, lounge area......the list goes on. And we caught a deal on groupon! If your choosing between this place and somewhere else...stay here!! The staff is very friendly and welcoming as well"}
{"text":"Rooms are decent, location good. Was a lot of construction going on outside. They will nickel and dime you though... All the usual stuff, parking ($$), internet etc (can waive if you're rewards). But they'll also bill you to receive packages (and you'll find out after you tip). Kicker was when after staying here for 5 days they wanted to charge a fee for a 1 hour late checkout. \"thanks for your business, now get out\""}
{"text":"This is a nice hotel, but there was a lot of maintenance going on while I was there for business. The escalators by the valet door were torn up all week, and two of the elevators will be under repair until the Fall. Not a big deal, and the staff smartly offered up the service elevators to limit waiting. I found the wait wasn't objectionable any of the 20 or so times I used the elevators. 
Three minor suggestions: 1) Ironing board pads. The diamond-shaped iron-ins on my shirt from the ironing board did not look very good. Easy fix. 2) Internet speed was horrible, particularly in the evenings (when everyone is online, no doubt). The system either needs maintenance or upgrading. 3) Your on-site restaurant deserves some marketing respect - I had the beet salad twice (once with chicken and once without) and it was incredible. The salmon and the roasted asparagus were delicious, too, but overly salty. With ever-changing restaurants all over downtown Phoenix, yours deserves more notoriety... at least in-house. It doesn't even show up on Google Maps.
If you want to stay in downtown Phoenix, I cannot imagine a better location... sports, arts, comedy, dining - everything is literally steps away. As others have said, the rooms are large, the staff is friendly, and updates are fresh.
One minor personal thing - when I checked in, I asked a couple staff members if there was any chance they had a piano available on which I could practice a couple of songs (playing for an event on the weekend with no chance to practice beforehand); first they told me there might be some open mic nights around, and when I explained I just needed to run through two songs, they indicated they might be able to help and would get back to me. Never heard another thing. It's not a fire, but it was a chance for them to do something extra and they blew it. Even if they couldn't help, they should've followed up."}
{"text":"I viewed this location to have our wedding and Amber from Catering and Sales was AMAZING!  She provides a very special tour of the property and makes the experience fun and welcoming.  She is very patient, kind and caring which makes planning your wedding even more special.  She is always available and answers any questions you may have. She is also willing to work with you to make your special day the best day of your life.  I highly recommend seeing Amber if you plan on having an event here at the Marriott and I ensure you, she will take care of you with a genuine smile on her face.  The rooms are amazing, comfortable, and provide great views of downtown Phoenix.  The hotel has a historic, and unique feel for it and they're some hidden places inside that you can go searching for, which makes your stay even more fun!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what inspired the Marriott hotel chain to call this one Renaissance because it did seem like a lot of the stuff inside the hotel was actually very modern and quite stylish and unique. It does kind of bring various historical ideas to mind and I don't think it's really that appropriate to call it renaissance if it isn't even supposed to be somewhat historical in any sense. 

The hotel was somewhat overpriced too compared to various other hotels in the Marriott chain. But the location was alright and my room was very clean and tidy when I came to the hotel. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful my entire stay which is definitely one of those defining things that makes a hotel much better or a whole lot worse and the service at the hotel was definitely one of the best features about this hotel."}
{"text":"Great hotel. Whenever I get to check in early at a hotel that always gets points for me. 10am check in. Nice staff. Stayed twice and got an older suite once and a newer smaller room the second time. They seem to be upgrading everything there. Walking distance to the arena and Chase field."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I have stayed here during an anniversary staycation and we love to go to the Discovery Hour during the week. The staff is wonderful, the rooms are beautiful and the location is perfect!"}
{"text":"I did some research, came across this hotel and booked a room for 2nites. It's a really classy, posh hotel conveniently located in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  The room we stayed in was very spacious , clean and had an ok view of the city.  There was a problem with the toilet and when I informed the maintenace department about it someone came by and took care of it right away.  There is also a Light Rail station conveniently located in front of the hotel.  That is a great way to get around and it is very affordable. You can purchase a day pass or a one-way pass.  There aren't too many restaurants around the hotel.  I went to a Thai restaurant and that was ok.  
The one major problem I had at this hotel was the level of customer service I experienced by one of the servers at the restaurant in the Lobby level (Mastro's Cafe). We went there for breakfast one morning and we just stood there for a good 5 minutes or so waiting to be seated.  There were many tables available, but no one acknowledged our presence or greeted us,..so we seated ourselves.  We were ready to order something to drink and we waited and waited and waited. There were 2 servers working that morning and after what seemed like an eternity I waved my hand to get the attention of one of the servers. When I did a different server quickly came by and her first words to me were not \"Good Morning\" or \"What can I get you?\", but instead it was \"Geez! Gimme a minute to get to you...It's early in the morning..I'm coming!\" I was shocked by her unprofessional demeanor and unpleasant energy. Then she comes back and asks if this is going to be one one or two seperate checks. I explained to her that when we made the reservations we purchased the breakfast package, but rather than listen to what I was trying to explain until I was finished she rudely cut me off in the middle of my sentence and asked me again in a very forceful, condescendning tone \"One check or two?\".  So I told her \"one\".  She then comes back a few minutes later and tones down her attitude and asked me if I had purchased the breakfast package. I said \"Thats what I was trying to explain to you and you cut me off so I never was able to finish explaining that to you.\" At this point I left my table to have a word with the manager.  He was super professional, nice and calm and apologizeed for the inconvenience.That afternoon when we came back to our room there was a nice platter or cheese, biscuits and two bottled waters along with an apology note.  
All the other hotel employees that I came across at this hotel were very warm, helpful and hospitable. The food at the restaurant was great. There were an assortment of fresh fruits, bread, eggs, meat, cheese & yogurt.  Dinner at this restaurant was outstanding and the night staff was EXCEPTIONAL!! Jackie was our server & she was a ROCKSTAR!! Jackie and the rest of the crew working that night all get GOLD STARS!!
Other than that incident we enjoyed our stay there.  But that one employee really left me wondering what kind of customer service training this hotel offers to it's staff. Clearly she does not belong in the Hospitality Industry.   
If you do decide to stay at this property just be aware that (like some other Yelpers have mentioned) that the level of customer service is not all that great.  There is a lot of room for improvement!"}
{"text":"Stayed for phoenix comic con, I wasn't very happy. My roommate card was illegally charged. They did not have authorization to charge the card. Our hotel room had a few problems, but nothing to blow up over. The guy down the hall from us was rude which they couldn't fix. The manager I assume was very sweet about it and we even helped her clean up their mess. I do want to give her kudos for being sweet and coming to clean up their mess. 

The bar staff was friendly.

I am a bit upset that I couldn't give them more stars because I wasn't fully happy, but I do appreciate their hard work. I would like it next time if they actually told me about the deposit. Normally I was always charged 50 dollars, but the deposit was 150 which I wasn't aware of."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed our stay here.  This location is close to many restaurants and a walk to the Arizona Science Center. 

Our favorite part was the renovated Elevate Breakfast/Snack Lounge and the people who staff it.  Pam, Andrew and Ben went above and beyond to make our stay as pleasant as possible. For example, when we mentioned to Andrew that our original plans to go to Sedona were disrupted by the wild fire, Andrew, of his own accord, outlined an entirely new plan for us and each idea he recommended was top notch.  So we extended our stay at the Renaissance and had a fabulous vacation."}
{"text":"Stayed here between December 12th - 15th.

Absolutely beautiful hotel.

Paid $132 per night for a Queen room. The room itself was faultless, it spotlessly clean and beautifully presented.

The room featured a queen size bed, 2 cordless phones, mini fridge, air con, 32\" TV with cable, a safe and a desk. Wifi was no extra and the connection quality was good.

Room service was available although I didn't use it.

I would definately stay here again."}
{"text":"Love it so far. This my second night and staff have been great. Bar is nice and the beet salad is great. I wish there was more going on down town Phoenix and it seems they are working on that. My room is great. Wish there was a little less fake fragrance in the hallways. My only complaint. Lol"}
{"text":"We are having an amazing stay!! I know, when was the last time someone took time out of their vacation to write a review before they left? From the first moment of our late evening arrival, there was music and a welcoming staff to greet us. Water was provided by own personal Navigator who is available to all guests and was able to tell us all the different sites to see while visiting in a comfortable no pressure style. The entire hotel is modern and slick yet still feels warm and home away from home. We heard a bit of noise from a handicap assessable upgrade they are providing future guests and from the front desk, to reception to upper management we were swarmed with hospitality and going out of their way to make us feel comfortable and us and the situation taken care of. The food was amazing, and it is close to not only transportation but walking distance to all the local action - yet providing a zen place to lay by the pool and rest our heads. A top choice hotel for the area by far thanks to the amazing service and comfortable rooms, from the friendly night room service voice on the phone, to management, to Michael who takes care of the pool area late night. Thanks for making our stay, a perfect one."}
{"text":"My one star is based on price compared to quality.

In addition to kind of a dumpy place with too many staff asking what they can do for me. they charge about $12 for internet and $25 for parking.
Honestly, for the $200 it costs to stay there, you would think they could improve the smell in the hallways too."}
{"text":"Don't stay here right now until you find out the construction in the garage is done, unless you want to pay for a drilling noise.  Usually a pretty quiet hotel.  Very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Great clean hotel in downtown Phoenix, 1 block from the Convention Center.  Fantastic reception staff.  Clean rooms.  Good shower pressure and temperature control.  Comfortable beds."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel! Right in the heart of downtown. The staff is so incredibly kind. I've never experienced such great customer service at a hotel before. My 4 year old was a little cranky after a long drive & the staff was so kind to her. Offering me for her to have ice cream. They gave her the ice cream, took a picture with her & she was a happy camper again. Stayed there for 2 nights, 3 days & every time the staff saw my daughter they (especially Sybil I believe her name was) would call her by name, give her a hug & talk to her. Great food, fun bar area, clean, beautiful rooms, & undeniable outstanding customer service. Whenever I'm back in this area I WILL be staying here again. Thank you for making my family's vacation that much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Well done, Renaissance. Your customer service is phenomenal. We really enjoyed our stay and will be sharing our experience with family and friends. Especially those from out of town who need a place to stay downtown when here for business. Thank you so much for all the personal touches. It was a wonderful surprise and a much appreciated gesture! Every staff member we spoke with were great, but a shout out to Brett at the front desk and Rhonda at the bar. You got two true gems there that have the gift that when they were assisting my husband and I made a feel like the most important people there. Thank you for a wonderful and memorable stay."}
{"text":"Beautiful downtown property with amazing guest rooms"}
{"text":"The Renaissance is a very nice hotel. The staff is remarkable. We had an appetizer at the hotel bar - service was fantastic and the fish tacos were wonderful. The rooms are tastefully decorated and the work space is designed to be useful - outlets on top of the desk. I liked the reading lights next to the beds as well - nice touch. Our conference hosted a reception on the fifth floor patio/pool area. It was perfect. The service was stellar and the appetizers were very good. I certainly recommend this hotel to business travelers."}
{"text":"Check your credit card a day or two after you check out because they charged my credit card twice. Hotel is in a nice location, everything's in walking distance. I visit Phoenix often for business and sporting events."}
{"text":"Attended an network event on the pool deck - very nicely done.  Apps were great."}
{"text":"Strike one: $30/day parking.
Strike two: room smells like someone was cooking curry all day.
Strike three: needs an overhaul.

Conclusion: save your money and stay at one of the many other options nearby"}
{"text":"Had a very nice stay. Got in very late on Friday night/Saturday morning and the desk clerk was very sweet and helpful. I chose to self park ( $19 a day for in and out privileges as I was in town for family events) but the valet was super helpful in directing me to the garage. 
The room was very nice. Loved the huge W
windows which offered a nice city view. The bed was super comfortable and I loved the pillows. We had a couch with a pullout bed, which was a nice option for my son. The only negatives there were: 1) the furniture (while pretty) was crazy heavy and hard to move, 2) the sheets looked as if they may not have been changed from their last use. I knew it was late but requested new sheets that never arrived. Thankfully we had a few blankets of our own and I was able to use them to make his bed.
Fruit infused water is a nice touch in the lobby, after walking around down town it was a welcome treat. Also the option to check out using a self service kiosk was great. The bell hops were extremely helpful when it came time to leave, such a smooth process.
The only other downside was the random phone call from the valet around 2 AM about a phone charger I was apparently looking for. I am guessing they called the wrong room on accident."}
{"text":"The hotel is surrounded by construction and not easy to find or get to.  The place is not that clean stuff all over the rugs, under your bed and on the tile flooring throughout the hotel. 

When checking in at the front desk Gabriel was nice but he yells when he talks to you, and sort of snooty.  I asked if I could get a Marriott Reward member upgrade he said no that they would have to charge me for an upgrade.  So I asked for at least a view, they charge for that also.  For what they charge their guest they need to clean the place up and be more accommodating. 

And parking per day is $35 and they only offer valet only, and after hours you

Pros: Manny their valet employee greeted me with a warm and friendly personality, he was very helpful to assist me take some stuff to the front desk.  He knows the area very well, offered some great recommendations to go see and to eat at. Great customer service Manny.

They have a nice indoor/oitdoor bar."}
{"text":"Nice historic spot.  Right in downtown and near everything.  Angus burger was good and great selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"This category 5 ( should be higher)  hotel was recently updated and reflects the current Marriott style and ambiance. Beautiful executive lounge for the gold and platinum members. The pool is just so so... Small and very limited seating but we were in Phoenix for a wedding so the comfort of the room was most important. Valet is 30$ which is the only option for parking at this location other than meters on the street. I would love to return to this property for a Diamond back game and be able to walk to stadium!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the staff was very nice.
However
I stayed at this property for over 2-weeks for a conference.  I did not have the less expensive group rate as I booked a larger room (since I was going to be there for so long).  For the larger room my rate was roughly double the rate of others in my group -- which I knew.  Others in my group with the less expensive rooms all received the $20 breakfast buffet free each day.  I did not...  I don't really typically even eat breakfast but it was sort of the principle of the idea that with a much more expensive room, I did not get the breakfast.  The hotel was absolutely \"unable\" to do anything about this.  It just came across as very cheap on their behalf.

The elevators were also terrible.  Many had cracked, warped, removed internal paneling. On multiple occasions we waited close to 10 minutes for an elevator (and you could hear them going by).  Sometimes the floors would not stay lit and the elevator would just not stop at the selected floor.  One one of my last nights they were simply not functioning and we managed to find the freight elevator.

I do not believe that I would choose to stay at this property again."}
{"text":"There were too many problems for a luxury hotel to have.  

First, I made the mistake of reserving my room by phone. When I arrived, they had no reservation for me, and I was lucky to still get a room.  My friend phoned in her reservation separately, and her reservation also wasn't there, forcing her to go elsewhere.

Also, the hotel room doors may as well not exist for all the sound they let in.  Prepare to hear every word spoken in your hallway along with the latching of all the other doors.

I won't blame the hotel for being over air-conditioned, since that's probably a problem everywhere in Phoenix (America?).

The pool is featureless, small, and maxes at 5'6\" depth.

On the plus side, their catered food for my conference was great.

Charging $10/day for their slower tier internet access is unjustifiable.

Lastly, there was a small fridge in my room in the cabinets.  And what did I find in this fridge? The previous guests' half empty glass of wine and sandwich portion.  Yuck.

."}
{"text":"Arrived at 2:30 am to a lobby which was decorated with a modern flair. Decorated in browns, greens, and orange colors. Very peaceful and relaxing. Person at the registration desk was very pleasing and accommodating. The room, small suite, was nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. Although, no safe or refrigerator in room but that didn't really matter to us. The hotel offered us free umbrellas since it was raining.  Customer service was outstanding. 

We attended an event at the US Airway Center, only two walking blocks away. Following our event, we were in lobby thinking what we were going to do and we were approached  by a bellman asking if we needed help. Great customer service. The place was clean, the food was good, the service was great.  Only downside was valet parking at $27 a night. I would stay here again."}
{"text":"I stayed here for work (Two days of meetings).  Checking in was a breeze and staff was very friendly.  King size bed on the 8th floor.  My room overlooked the pool area.  Nice not to be staring into another building or hotel.  The bed was comfortable.  It was a little stuffy but at least it wasn't freezing like most Phoenix hotels.  The fitness room had at least 5 treadmills, weights and bikes. The outdoor pool looked nice, but I didn't get in.  The lobby area is gorgeous; beautiful crystals and gems on the tables.  There is a very nice restaurant/bar in the lobby with windows that open up to the sidewalk; there is a restaurant that is farther back, with a little more privacy, there is a Starbucks which was great for me to get my morning chai, and last the lounge on the 19th floor was fantastic!  Great breakfast and dinner with comfy chairs.  The one drawback was the parking situation.  It cost $30 for valet services."}
{"text":"Always a high standard and always a great hotel. I love this hotel. The lobby is welcoming, the staff is quick to serve and the rooms are wonderful. 

The breakfast style buffet is good. The food is fresh and coffee is great. Room service is slightly slower than you would want however the food is top notch. 

This is one of the higher end hotels in Arizona. The rooms are clean, comfy and stylish. The maid service is just wonderful friendly and silently in the backdrop.

I recommend this for conventions! I go every year for Arizona theater festival and it's amazing that they manage so many people in the hotel and not loose a step in service. 

The only reason it is not 5 star for me- is that on weekends the location you have limited options in down town Phoenix. The Arizona Center is close by and a few other places but not quite as happening as Mill ave.

However you can't go wrong with this hotel."}
{"text":"Thin walls, great big breakfast if you order it. Everyone was very nice and hospitable. They could give free wifi, that's kind of something that should be a given.  Great location if you have to go to the convention center. Nice bar in the lobby, and I had a HUGE room!"}
{"text":"Nicely appointed room with desk containing numerous electrical and digital ports for business travel.  Comfy, large beds.  Storage is good.  Fan in the bathroom would be nice for shower moisture.  That said, the sink can get super hot, but the shower never got above lukewarm.  
All in all a nice hotel downtown."}
{"text":"This review is for the concierge desk; not the hotel
Pamphlet in my room had a picture of the 'navigator' who runs the concierge desk, Jesse Perry.  Didn't read it, but saw the picture.  Low & behold, there he was at the desk when I stopped by with a question about dinner suggestions.

After speaking with him, I could see why they gave him so much press.  He spent time helping me find what would fit my needs & had a couple of recommendations.  Think all would have been great, but it was the experience which also set it apart.

Fantastic service; was a quick trip, so,don't know how the rest of the hotel fairs, but if this is an example, then I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am writing this review to tell everyone DO NOT stay at this hotel!  We literally just checked in at 430pm tonight and were told twice that our we were too loud in our own hotel room and we were speaking at slightly above a whisper, in a normal voice.  We chose to leave and demanded a full refund for the hotel and vallet which we have been promised. We left at 6pm and stayed a total of an hour and a half,  and we're told that we were too loud at 6pm at night.  We were told the the people that complained are flight attendants and they take first priority. Please don't stay at this hotel unless you chose not to speak at all during your stay.  The employee working for the room operations manager is awful at customer service and the manager stated he has to side with the complaints.  Who goes to sleep at 6pm and who compains about talking above a whisper? Awful experience and awful hotel.  Do not stay here!"}
{"text":"I live downtown Phx and absolutely love the community street parties here, local art shows, organic market food and the list goes on. Great to have this as part of the neighborhood! If I ever had a need to stay in the rooms I'm sure I would give it a 5 star rating. Well done!!"}
{"text":"What a great party in the street tonight! This hotel has the most happening events. There is no better downtown hotel."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this hotel and for the cost, it felt like a steal. We ran into a couple of problems. 

1. The elevators are under maintenance so they routed us to the service ones which... well they're service elevators for a reason I guess. And they smell bad.

2. The room was comfortable but there were signs of aging in the bath tub. You could see some sort of mold getting to form. 

These are not things I would expect for a higher class hotel - even in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This hotel has such a beautiful lobby.  I came here with several friends for the Homebase Poetry Open Mic 3 Year anniversary {1/15/12}.  We were hungry so we went downstairs to the bar for a snack.  It didn't start off well when the bartender let us know many of the items on the menu weren't available for consumption.  Uh oh....the looks on my friend and my faces could have killed him, lol.  I think he spent the rest of the night trying to make it up to us!

We settled on fries, some of us had regular, some of us had sweet potato.  Both were tasty.  The spicy sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was really yummy!  I used that alone to finish off my fries."}
{"text":"We were only here walking by and decided to pop in to check it out and it is absolutely beautiful!  We had a drink at the bar after walking around some and the bartender was fantastic!  She was welcoming, friendly and just a complete joy! Very personable!  We didnt stay long, just long enough for our drink but hopefully we will be in the area soon to check this place out again, maybe in more detail!"}
{"text":"Get Jesse as your \"navigator\" or I like to say lobby boy due to my love for Wes Anderson and The Grand Budapest Hotel. But really he's a doll and has been the Zero to my M. Gustav even though I'm a guest. I hope he runs/owns this hotel one day. He's a prince."}
{"text":"Nice hotel, bar and conference venue. The rooms are above-average for the business traveler."}
{"text":"Stayed here for three nights on business and it was a very comfortable visit. The staff all go out of their way to welcome you and help out with any needs. 

When I approached my hotel room door, I was a little concerned. The door itself seems vintage 1955. But once I opened it up and walked into my room, I was met by a very modern, functional, attractive, and clean room - with a view, even. (see my photos)

There was some cool hotel-made video playing on my screen to music that reminded me of U2 circa 1985. I found the tune catchy so I let it cycle again and again (it runs about 5 min long). It's about a young couple who come to...what else? The Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel for a vacation getaway. 

They have a blast, starting off with few drinks at the bar, followed by an excellent dinner, then wake up for some pool time under a blazing Arizona sun, then a nice friendly game of outdoor full-bodied chess. It doesn't end there as they head out to a night club for some fun, and...well you get the point. 

Hats off to whoever prepared this marketing piece. It's so well done I found it almost \"haunting.\" In a good way. The sounds and images stuck with me throughout the week and provided a nice \"escape\" during many hours of conferencing. By the time you read this, it may not even be there but I had to mention it. 

I was there for work, so no golf or pools or drinks with a girl at the bar. Which is a good thing, because that would take some explaining to my coworkers...and my Colorado girl! 

But I had a great time here the entire four days. Very convenient location, too. Just about 10 min to airport via taxi. The metro rail is also right across the street, and it goes to the airport as well. There are many restaurants and a CVS within walking distance, too. 

Ordered room service one morning...most excellent. (see photo)

Some nearby blocks can be a bit sketchy at night, but it didn't seem dangerous. Just watch your back. Good advice in any town. 

Thanks for the great stay, Renaissance. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Stayed the night to attend a concert downtown. Really beautiful hotel! Loved the decorations and the bar area, very friendly staff. The room was modern and I loved the separate vanity from the shower area, plus they stock the bathroom with Aveda products! The breakfast buffet was good if a bit pricey, but the service was excellent. Great downtown location, walk easily to various restaurants, bars, and venues. Would definitely stay here again!"}
{"text":"This hotel is very swanky!  Beautiful lobby, very upscale. Both times I stayed here, the room was spotless, the bed was soft and fluffy with lots of pillows, and they offer a tray in the bathroom with not only soap, shampoo & conditioner, but mouthwash, shower gel, and body lotion, too!  The only drawback I have with this hotel is that the rooms don't really have a lot of floor space. Everything is kinda crammed in tight. The bathroom is very spacious but the room, itself, is not. There's not a whole lot of space to lay your suitcase out on the floor and go through your stuff.  Also, overnight parking is $30, which is highway robbery, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE customer service!

I originally was a little bit dissatisfied with my stay due to some difficult circumstances. While I was here a couple elevators were out of service (they've since been fixed, woohoo!) but it made for a little bit of an inconvenience but the staff went out of the way with apologies and trying to make up for it. 

Silly me left some items there at the hotel, and the General Manager, Paige went beyond out of her way to make sure that they were returned back to me, practically like new! In addition, her assistant manager Marti reached out to me initially to make sure things got handled as quickly as possible, and passed it up to Paige.

I've worked in management positions and I know how consuming the job can be, and the fact that Paige and Marti went so out of their way speaks volumes about the customer service and quality standards of this hotel! They make sure that all of their employees are trained and are always welcoming (even offering towels or water when you come in/ are in the lobby area). The bar there is great, and also make sure you try their breakfast menu! Delicious!

Thank you again Renaissance for such a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"I had a meeting at this hotel last week and really liked this place. The staff were so easy to work with from the front desk, reservations and banquet they were all great. This hotel is perfect if you are going to a convention the place was packed with convention goers. I did get out one night and there is a decent about of restaurants in the area you can find a cool place for sure. The hotel was extremely clean and the rooms were a decent size a plus was they offered netflix in your room if you just need to take a break! I would highly recommend this hotel if you are in town on business. Also forgot to mention their food in the bar was excellent I was very surprised because of my schedule I had to eat there several times and it was actually good."}
{"text":"While I have stayed at nicer hotels before, I would have to say those locations were more on the \"resorty\" side which makes the Renaissance pretty high up there when it comes to rating an everyday hotel! 

Not only is it located in the very center of Phoenix, the amenities and rooms were top notch and well worth the price. The staff was beyond accommodating and really gave me the impression they enjoyed being at work and taking care of the guests. From the valets to the bartenders, the Renaissance staff gave our stay a positive memory. 

There is a well equipped gym with a fairly small pool located on the 5th floor (I originally thought it was  rooftop pool). A downside would be the open deck area is located on the north side of the building which means a LOT of shade for those who want to relax in the Phoenix sun...in fact, to get a good spot on a lounge chair (there aren't many), you'd have to schedule your time based on where the sun was in location to the hotel's shadow. 

If you're traveling on business, it would be suggested to make sure the valet is prepared in advance to get your car during weekdays so you're not inconvenienced with getting to work - but it should go without saying by now, the team is all about helping you! 

To complete this \"good-bad-good sandwich\" I will rave about the services again - we not only were treated to a beautiful dream catcher (cute touch), but the rooms were spacious and quiet. Upon the second day, we were treated to a free breakfast (approx. $40 value), free drinks and a free dinner (even though we didn't see the bill, my guess is that was a good $175 no questions asked). Of course, I don't want readers to think the Renaissance just gave that out for no reason - we did have some valid concerns which were not the hotel's fault, but they were not only able to resolve the issues quickly, they cared for us (we didn't expect any form of graciousness)."}
{"text":"This hotel has undergone it's own Renaissance. I've watched the progress over the past three years and they have done an amazing job. This place like any other hotel has a few kinks but I highly recommend it for the price and the location.  It is a beautiful place and the staff is very accommodating. The only drawback in the wintertime the pool is in the shade all day however in the summer it is a welcome spot. Great food at the in-house restaurant a nice bar and a Starbucks on location. One of the more beautiful lobby's in town as well.  The rooms are average size and newly remodeled for the modern traveler, plenty of outlets for your electronics and good lighting in the room and a great choice of cable channels. Heat and AC work well and you may actually shut it all off and open the window which is rare these days. The fitness center is adequate and clean with a view of the pool. I am a regular guest here every time I come to town."}
{"text":"Nice and classy look. Clean rooms. Starbucks on site. Took a swim in the pool and it was cozy. It's more of a business hotel but I enjoyed it. Not a single sight of children running around. Customer service was a A++ the stadiums were walking distance a lot of places to eat around there walking distance also. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Renaissance Phoenix is attractive; the rooms, while small, are nicely furnished.  The bed in 1926 is comfortable, the pillows decent, and the carpet fresh.  The décor has an old-world library feel to it; I liked it.

The shower/toilet room is claustrophobic.  I'm 5'4\" and I can touch the ceiling while flat on my feet.  God help anyone 6' or over, as the bathtub, when you step in to shower, is elevated another four inches or so.  

I was fine, but even at my height I thought I might graze my head against the drywall over me.  Of course I didn't - there was a solid 12\" between my noggin and the ceiling, but that didn't offset the sensation of being Alice after drinking the liquid to make her big.

The towels:  may I suggest the hotel tip white vinegar in the wash water?  It works like fabric softener, which these sandpaper like towels could sorely use (bonus:  vinegar is a disinfectant and deodorizer, not that they needed it).  When I'm at a luxury hotel, I'm looking for big, fluffy towels.  (You might want to go over the standard 50\" towel, too, if you really want to up your game.)

Nice toiletries, with a selection of lotion, shampoo, body wash etc.

The executive lounge is sizable, and had plenty of hot/cold food, always a bonus.  It's a little too hip/eclectic for my taste, so I waddled back to my library-room.

The lights in the hallway are unpleasant in that they burn into your eyeballs, so you see the remnant of the light after you look away.  I found the best way to travel the halls was to gaze firmly at the floor.

When people are heading to/from their rooms, the elevators get overrun.  Since the building is tall (19 stories) with only four elevators, it can get slow going, especially when one is out of commission (as one was during my stay).

IF YOU HAVE A CAR (and are cheap like me)... the valet is $29.  Half a block away is the Chase Tower, which allows overnight parking for $14 (but no in-and-out privileges).  I had no problem parking there.

It's a short walk from the hotel to the light rail, which will get you to/from the airport if you need it.

All in all, it's a nice hotel."}
{"text":"Amazing service EVERY TIME! I stay at this hotel about once a week for work and I've never ever been disappointed. The location is great. Walking distance to ANYTHING you want to eat or do. Sushi, Thai, burgers, pizza. There's also an AMC, lucky strike bowling, standup comedy just around the corner. Can't go wrong staying here. The customer service is always TOP KNOTCH! On my recent stay I went out after my workout for some takeout and as I got back inside I realized I didn't get myself something to drink. I went to the small souvenir shop but it was closed for 15 mins. So I went to the front desk to ask where I could find a vending machine for a soda. The guy asked what kind of soda I wanted and I said, whichever just regular not diet. He came back with two different choices for me. They always always go out of their way to make sure your stay here is perfect."}
{"text":"Best fresh lunch you could have in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Really liked this hotel! I'd love to give four stars but had just a few qualms. 
We came straight from Pinetop to the hotel (had concert tickets and didn't want to drive back to Tucson) so, we needed to reorganize our stuff. The valet was very friendly but didn't give us the space or time to even get out of the car before wanting to help us get our car valet-ed and our stuff out. We asked him to wait while we checked in. 
When we came back it was the same issue and we ended up feeling really rushed and unorganized with what we took upstairs. FYI: Valet parking is $30 and not included with the room. We would have probably found parking elsewhere had we wanted to fight the whole situation. Obviously, we are responsible for finding out rates like that but I think it's important to note that the valet's actions upon check-in (with no communication about valet rates) was misleading. 

The hotel has great updates. The only issue was our bath tub didn't drain very fast, which resulted in standing water while showering. Oh and ps. They lock the lobby bathrooms at night. Not sure what time exactly; we came back after 10pm. The bar was still open downstairs but not the bathrooms. Otherwise, we liked this hotel and would probably stay there again."}
{"text":"Expensive but I LOVE it!

Look, I am a Marriott rewards member, and while the rooms are expensive they are really nice, the 17th floor was awesome (by the way it goes from 12 to 14....like 14 isn't really 13 at that point). The breakfast had fresh fruit, and not the cheap melon stuff, the actual strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. I am a loyal rewards member and have yet to stay in a bad hotel!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel, clean rooms with beautiful rich color decor, bigger than normal gym.  Safe area, Convention Center nearby.  Took the Metro in from the airport.  From terminal, take air train (terminal 4) down a long gray hallway --- follow the signs.  Downstairs to street level.  There is a kiosk for $2.00 one way or $4.00 all day pass.  Took train West bound to Central and Washington, 13th stop.  Walking distance to hotel.  Stopped in at My Mom's Thai restaurant.  Experience with Renaissance good with friendly staff who went out of their way to be personable and graciously give best customer service."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to the property and it continues to be absolutely outstanding. The staff is super friendly and the look and feel of the lobby since the renovation is mind blowing. As I was taking pictures of the separate  but harmonious lobby spaces, the security manager walked over and introduced himself to me. He gave me an overview of the property and renovations. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. And I love the Aveda bath products. The lounge staff is equally nice and food quality is fine for a property of this caliber. Sara in the lounge is absolutely excellent. She bends over backwards for you!"}
{"text":"Great hotel in the heart of PHX. Friendly staff, very comfortable rooms. Great hotel bar. Close to all the attractions."}
{"text":"I stayed here a year ago at the same time and my stay was fine so I made a reservation to stay here again this year. My mistake was assuming that the situation for moving guests from floor to floor would be one capable of accommodating guests on a busy weekend. Apparently this is not a given in this industry as half of their elevators are inoperable leaving only 2 elevators in operation. If you are an extremely patient person that does not mind spending a considerable amount of time (5-10 minutes) waiting for a car every single time you want to use it between 9 am and 9 pm, and then stopping at every single floor to pick up another person who also waited 5-10 minutes for their ride, you should be fine. I'm not that person. Timely elevator travel should be a given in a world where you pay $10 per day for internet and $30 per day to park.  I'm told this situation will not be rectified until some time in September. Had I known this I would have chosen another place to stay. They do not make this clear at reservation time and they only tell you this after you have gone through the check in process when they hand you your key. It's sort of an \"oh, yeah. About the elevators.....\" afterthought. For future visits I'll be exploring the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Love your bar and food served there.
Thank you for taking cards for valet.  However, I would appreciate your hotel more if they don't lose my car and the long valet wait..."}
{"text":"This hotel is very nice! Literally steps away from the convention center. Perfect for work  travel. Walking distance from really good restaurants. Only complaint is the pool and sundeck. Yet it is really nice, it is shaded all day due to the tall buildings. I went in January so maybe it was the time of year..., but definitely was hoping to get a little more sun during our stay. Other then that the hotel is really great and very clean."}
{"text":"We had landed early from our flight to Phoenix from LA. My fiancé and I contacted the hotel letting them know we were arriving early and we would love an early check-in. We arrived around 10:30 in the morning and there were no rooms available for us at the moment. We stored our bags with the bell service and walked around exploring the downtown, Phoenix area. A few hours later we were contacted that our room was ready. We had a beautiful room with access to the concierge lounge on the top level. They had complimentary breakfast and hors d'oeuvres hours almost every day. They have a beautiful downtown, lobby area that is very spacious as well as a great restaurant and bar in the lobby level as well. There is a gift shop, an outdoor pool, and a fitness center as amenities on the property. This hotel is located in the middle of downtown Phoenix, perfect walking distance to the convention center and a lot of restaurants and bars. The price is a bit on the high side, but usually Renaissance/Marriott properties are. You get what you pay for, for sure! Our room was beautiful, on the smaller side but nice. I believe you have to pay to park your car overnight so keep that in mind when traveling. The pool is very disappointing as it is very small and has very limited seats. My fiancé and I decided to use the pool when we first got there. You have to call down to the lobby bar/restaurant for drinks or food at the pool. They also charge you a service fee even though it is your only option. We ordered two margaritas up to the pool. It took almost an hour. By the time the drinks were delivered, we didn't want to be rude but it was so hot out we were ready to leave the pool. We asked what was taking so long and the polite man who delivered our drinks apologized and said the service was behind. We didn't feel as though we should have to pay for our drinks, due to the delay in service. We were told when we ordered our drinks it would be 20 minutes at the most. He said he would need to check with the manager to see if it would be all right to remove these from our tab. This added even more time. He came back and said it was fine. We tipped him a five, drank our drinks, also inspired the rest of the pool to order margaritas, and were on our way out. The next day at the pool, we ordered food. We were hoping for a better situation. The food came out in a timely manner, as well as a few more drinks. The manager Meagan came up and the polite man delivering the food, same as yesterday, named Syl came up with a manager as well. They both apologized about the delayed service and talked to us for about 10 minutes. It was a very nice gesture. There was a health & fitness convention happening at the same time, so there were a lot of people at the gym every morning and also outside, doing their own training sessions. It was motivating, but also a little bit hard to work out in the fitness center. Not sure that would always be a problem, though. We had a delicious craft cocktail at the bar-Dust Cutter downstairs. Overall, this day was pretty good  Hotel and I would stay here again if I needed to."}
{"text":"Good food, decent hotel service, but horrible elevators (slow, shakey, and sometimes couldn't even get to my floor). Great clean rooms, but hot common areas.. Horrible service in the lobby gift shop. The guy working the counter was obviously irritated I was taking away his time from talking with his co workers. Then told me to go get my credit card because he shut down the computer he needed to charge my room early...."}
{"text":"No Platinum Check-In, and airline crews are priority #1 here. Fortunately I like American. But I dislike lines.

Good whiskey bar in lobby with some nice botanical selections - the bartenders are mixologists and are good at their um, crafts.

Room selection is bare basics. It is more of a renaissance era Hotel in modern times. It's lobby is chic but it ends there."}
{"text":"Amie, the wedding coordinator, was extremely helpful and accommodating.  She was prompt in her email responses to me, and I never felt there was red-tape, unlike some other hotels in the area.  While other hotels would come back saying things like, \"Our chef can't do that within your budget,\"  Amie's attitude was always positive and she would figure out a way to make things work for us, within our budget.

Unfortunately we went with a different venue for our wedding, but it was almost entirely because our family thought the greenery, golf course route was more suitable for us.  Had we decided to have our wedding in downtown Phoenix instead, we definitely would have gone with Amie and the Renaissance."}
{"text":"I was in town for one night and the company booked this hotel for me. I wasn't super impressed by any aspect of the hotel. The parking was difficult, I wasn't ever able to find self-parking (not sure whether or not there was self-parking) so I had to valet park ($27) - which was extremely busy and the line for valet was blocking traffic. Check in was smooth and the clerk was friendly. The room was small and dated in many aspects, the bathroom fixtures were particularly telling of the age of the hotel. Internet was available but cost $13.99. I wasn't able to find a menu for room service - there were many good restaurants within walking distance, so this wasn't a huge deal. Lastly, I needed to print a boarding pass for my flight the next day and had some difficulty finding the business center (on the lower level). I ultimately had to pay 40 cents per minute and 59 cents per page to print my boarding pass - I travel extensively and typically find that this is offered free of charge. While I understand that it is typical of downtown hotels to charge for every service, I felt that this went a bit to far.

To top it off - the hotel charged my credit card (that had been left on file for incidentals) for the entire hotel stay - though I had confirmed at check in that my company was being billed for the hotel stay. My company has assured me this was an error on the hotel's end - not sure what happened, but I am still awaiting a refund for the hotel stay (company advised me that hotel was supposed to issue a refund).

Overall, I would really give this hotel 2.5 stars - it was a very average and slightly expensive experience when I compare to my other downtown hotel experiences. Just meh - nothing that really impressed me."}
{"text":"For the most part it's a good stay, just not up to par with other Renaissance locations I've stayed at. 
I pick Marriott hotels because they're reliable and you know what you're getting. For this Renaissance, I have to say I expected better for my business stays. Each time I've been to this hotel, something has gone wrong. Whether it's they've cleaned only half the room, forgotten to provide towels or the room service isn't good. 
I don't recommend the room service. Each time, it's just not good food. Go out and get something. I didn't eat at the restaurant, so I can't rate that."}
{"text":"I had a two night stay at this location. Check in is at 4pm, check out is at 11am. It seems that the hotel is under the process of slowly renovating itself? I don't know. But I guess the lower floors are more modern and new, while the upper floors are older.

I came here with a group of classmates, we reserved two queen bedrooms with 3 people in each room. We arrived around 2pm, and the room I was in was not ready, but the other group's room was. We go up to their room on the 16th floor so we could leave our bags in there while we wait, and they were given a junior suite. It's nice and spacious, and it included a sofa, coffee table, breakfast table for four, the two queen beds, fridge & freezer---the works. 

After seeing the room THEY got, we were super excited to see our room! Once our room was finally ready, we headed down to our room on the 12th floor, and to our disappointment, we found that we just had a regular room. Womp, womp. To me, it seemed pretty small, there wasn't much room for us three girls and our luggage. The room was supplied with Aveda products (shampoo, soap, etc.), so that was nice. 

The only downside for me was that the room DID NOT  COME with a fridge ._. Hello, we bought all this alcohol at CVS and we didn't have a fridge to cool it in. Well, I was verbally complaining about it to my friends in the hallway (\"I don't understand, I went to a $75 motel in EAST LA, and THEY had a fridge for us, wtf?!\"), and one of the bellmen happened to overhear. I felt bad that he had heard us (or me) complaining, but it worked to our advantage, because he hooked us up with a fridge and stocked it with apple juice and cranberry juice.

I basically liked everything about this hotel, except for the fact that the elevator made me nauseous... and also because it didn't come with a fridge! ... and you have to pay for wi-fi!...and they did not have a jacuzzi (but I guess it makes sense that they don't have one since Phoenix is HOT)...  Boo!

{"text":"I stayed here twice, during June and July 2013, while I was in the process of locating to Phoenix.  So many of these reviews have aptly described the lobby. It is beautiful! 

If you are hungry they have a nice restaurant and food available at the lobby bar late in the evening.  I ate breakfast at the restaurant and it was delicious!  The waitress was awesome, providing excellent service. She went out of her way to help me with my order. Good downtown location if that is what you are looking for.  I found the area a little deserted at 9:00 PM, but again, this is a business area. The room was very nice, and the beds super comfortable.  I would recommend this hotel."}

I would definitely stay here again."}

I always enjoy my stay here and would recommend the property to anybody staying in the area. There isn't a lot to do around downtown but the hotel restaurant is very tasty. I must say the very best server is Rita! She does an amazing job with her customers and treats them like family!"}

{"text":"Location is great, price is high for what you get though.  No pool access, no free wifi...."}
{"text":"Beautiful place supper clean! The rooms are very nice the beds are so soft and very comfortable we will stay here again!!"}
{"text":"This Gold Marriott customer says, \"Good job.\"  My first visit in many years to downtown Phoenix. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi it was a good experience. It's my understanding that this became a Renaissance two years ago. Room was tastefully decorated. The Elevate Club Lounge was very nice (thank you, Pam and Andrew). Ordered room service. A spot on delivery and the food was excellent. Elevators look a bit worn, but I heard that they're getting a makeover this summer. Even The Shop had a better than usual selection of products (like, Jack Black products for men).

Now, there was one issue that occurred upon departure...and I felt so strongly about it that I called the hotel's on duty manager from the airport. There was an employee out front who was very insistent about ordering up Yellow taxis. There were none queued up and he was on his mobile trying to scrounge up more. A licensed taxi of a different company approached, I flagged them over. The hotel employee attempted, in a strong tone, to dissuade me from using this \"unlicensed street cab\" (which it was not), including using his body as a wall between me and my chosen transportation. I had to get very firm with him. Highly unprofessional. Obvious there's some compensation on the side going on there."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this hotel!  I stayed here on a recent trip to Phoenix AZ and I thought it was not only well located and in very close proximity to the downtown scene in Phoenix but overall I just thought it was  a really nice hotel, very well maintained, friendly staff, great room and a really nice lobby bar area.  If and when I return to Phoenix I will stay here again."}
{"text":"The rooms at the Renaissance Phoenix are nice and the bedding is very comfy. We were booked on the 5th floor, which I highly recommend. Only the 5th floor offers a nice patio area outside the rooms.

The staff was very nice and check out service was the smoothest I've ever experienced. My one note is that it would have been nice if the staff was a bit better versed about places to go in the area.

We had dinner in the bar and thought it was okay. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the grilled asparagus. By 7 PM they were running out of some of the items offered on the menu, which was disappointing. I was excited by seeing blueberry bread pudding on the menu, but found it to be dry and uninspired. Breakfast in the small dining room was very disappointing - runny scrambled eggs and tough sausage with a very small fruit selection along with mediocre store-bought muffins and the usual small boxes of cereal. On the upside, though, we were brought small carafes of coffee so didn't have to bother the very nice wait staff for refills.

I'd recommend the renaissance as a place to stay or a fun place to have a drink and appetizer. For meals, however, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This hotel is beautiful!! Husband and I stopped in for an appetizer and drink at the lounge. Staff was super friendly, especially Rebecca!!"}
{"text":"Hotel room was comfortable, room service was quick, front staff was helpful and attentive.  The hotel has a modern feel and upon checking there is a tablet that lists recommendations of places to eat and visit.  The hotel is going through some renovations so you need to use the service elevator to get to the hotel gym. Otherwise a great stay for my last 2 business trips. :)"}
{"text":"I have stayed at this hotel probably more than 250+ nights since 1995. It's been a Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Wyndham, and now a Marriott. What hasn't changed is the irreplaceable proximity to everything business, entertainment, and sports in Phoenix. There's no better location to downtown than this. It's been remodeled several times and still needs some updating. Until recently there was a Starbuck's on the ground floor - now about a block away. Rates in the high season can be high but in Phoenix in January who isn't prepared to pay more for the fantastic weather. Since becoming a Marriott rates have increased - that irks me. But off season rates for great rooms can be very reasonable. I've always found the staff to be very accommodating and receptive to working with you on better rates.

For years my complaints have not changed. Valet parking at the hotel is too expensive and TV selection is poor. I'm not sure why management doesn't do something about these deficiencies.

Everything is a trade off. There are more modern hotels. More luxurious hotels, better gyms, better pools, better room service. But all for a higher price. Generally, this is a great place to hotel.

Location, location, location. Nothing beats this hotels proximity to everything Phoenix."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were only in town for one night but loved this hotel. I've stayed at many Hilton/Marriott locations and I felt like the service and cleanliness went above and beyond. We were checking in fairly late and there happened to be a convention in town.  There were probably 25-30 people checking in when we walked into the lobby.  The valet person that greeted us immediately tried to find a manager and helped us get checked in \"on the sly\" so we wouldn't have to wait behind the convention goers. He didn't have to go out of his way to help us but it was so appreciated! The room was very modern and welcoming. We recommend for anyone coming into Phoenix - business or pleasure."}
{"text":"Stayed here while in town for work. The staff said that it was recently renovated and the lobby did look incredibly nice. Got checked in quickly and sent to the room. The room, while nice, didn't wow me like the lobby did. It was still very clean and nice. Wifi was fast and the valet guys were nice. Definitely a solid hotel in downtown Phoenix. Not sure if it was worth the rate I paid ($300+) since other hotels can be had for much cheaper in Phoenix. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again though."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix last week for a conference at this hotel.  Check in took abnormally long and I had to show email proof that we were promised the conference rate for our stay.  I have travelled a lot for business and never have been asked to find an email confirmation that we were attending the conference in order for the hotel to honour the rate.  Why else would I be there??

After our less than stellar check in experience, we headed to our room.  The sheets on the bed were dirty and the vent in the bathroom was FILTHY!  It was absolutely disgusting so we cleaned the vent ourselves.  We called the front desk and housekeeping came to change the sheets on the bed.  The lady from housekeeping was very, very nice.

We used the valet parking for our rental car each night.  On the 3rd night, someone used our rental car without our permission.  We left it at the valet, and when we picked it up the next day, it had been driven 12.5 miles, the back windows were down, the radio was blasting, the passenger seat had been reclined all the way back, and the convertible top had been used.  The gasoline had not been replaced.  When we brought this to the attention of the valet, they said that simply would never happen.  Well, all I have to say is, the mileage and evidence doesn't lie.  Someone drove our rental car without our permission and that is a very serious problem.  No manager even apologized to us.

When we woke up on the morning we were checking out, we received a receipt under our door for only half the amount of the room.  We called the front desk and they said that when there are two people in the room, they split the bill automatically.  But we only received one receipt?  Who else did they charge?  When we asked, the very ditzy person on the phone said they didn't have a credit card on file.  Our receipt said a credit card was charged.  When we asked for a corrected receipt, all of a sudden, it was a miracle - a credit card number was on file and was billed the entire amount!  We asked for an updated receipt.  One was thrown under our door about 15 minutes later.  No knock on the door, no apology for the error, nothing.  We asked for proof that the initial amount was not being billed and they refused to provide us with any paperwork indicating that we would not be double billed.

Needless to say, I will never recommend this hotel to anyone and will never stay here again.  There are plenty of other hotels in the area that I am sure would appreciate the business."}

Irma who checked us in was a total sweetheart and very helpful.   Just be patient with the slow elevator.  My only suggestion is for Renaissance to monitor the customer service reps.  I had to call to cancel one room and the lady I talked with was rather rude and short when talking to me.  She was an older lady and I'm sure is based off site in another state.  Staff inside the hotel is fantastic."}

{"text":"The hotel is fine, but nothing spectacular.  My room was clean and pretty comfortable, but you can see where the building is just old and redecorating cannot hide it all.  The elevators and hallways are really old, and the key swipe on the door looks ancient.  I didn't think it would actually work.  Also, the air conditioning was really loud.  I ended up turning the thermostat up so it would not turn on while I was trying to sleep.  Marriott did a pretty good job sprucing it up as best it could without gutting it, but it's still showing its age.  Service was pretty good."}

Although my room was not cleaned one evening the staff handled the problem quickly and professionally when I reported it and they made sure I was happy after the experience. I was a little disappointed in having to pay to park as I am not used to that. The hotel is under renovation but it was very difficult to tell.  I had a chance to listen to the hotel manager give a presentation to my convention group. I found her to be very genuine and innovative in her management style. Overall a very enjoyable couple days. I would definitely consider returning to this hotel."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix often, for fun, and had the opportunity to stay at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown, this past weekend, and absolutely loved it. I found the staff genuinely friendly and helpful. My check-in literally took less than 2 minutes and I was on my way up to my awesome room! 

The location is great....steps away from some awesome bars and restaurants like Hanny's (directly across the street)!

I definitely recommend this property for either business or pleasure (hopefully a little of both)!"}
{"text":"We booked a room at the Renaissance as the recommended hotel for an event at the Phoenix Convention Center. We were pleasantly surprised! The hotel is very nice, the rooms are comfortable, it's close to the Convention Center, and the staff is beyond friendly and helpful. They consistently greet us as we pass through the lobby and are ready to answer any questions. I inquired where I can print airline boarding passes and the young man walked me to the print station. The hotel is centrally located and there are plenty of nearby dining options. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"}
{"text":"Nice location (close to convention center); great staff, but falls down in other areas.  Understand Marriott just took over this property -- they need to update NOW.  Appears the building has the potential to be a lovely art nouveau type, but is run down. The exercise room is better than average; the concierge room on the 18th floor has water, coffee, soft drinks and snacks (nuts, cookies) available 24/7.  However, we're getting tired of staying at Marriott properties that need to be updated --  and are thinking of changing our loyalties."}
{"text":"Pros: The location of this hotel is good.  You can walk to the convention center, US Airways Center, Herberger Theater, court houses, etc.  The hotel charges for Wifi, but allows up to 5 devices on one charge.
Cons: Marston's Cafe's indifferent staff.  Valet parking pick -up location is not staffed adequately.  The outdoor lounging area is open 24/7, which means any rooms facing the outdoor patio lounge area gets to enjoy rowdy crowd noises at 3AM.
 
Marriott has done a great job updating an old hotel.  The lobby is pretty, and the location can't be beat.  However, staffing and service need to be reviewed because if this Renaissance is supposed to be a \"lifestyle\" property, then this property doesn't provide the service that would be expected.  Did you know you lost a sale at Marston's Cafe because 1) when I arrived when it opened, and the hostess was no where to be found, 2) got seated, but no server approached us for over 10 minutes.  I walked out and went to the nearest Starbucks for breakfast that wasn't on the property because the Marston's Cafe staff didn't want to serve me.  Also, if your staff doesn't want to serve anything other than the buffet, then why don't you drop the \"full service\" front?  Last year when I stayed at this property and had breakfast at Marston's, I had the same lousy service, and a resentful staff that made it known to me that they were put off that I was ordering a regular meal and not the buffet.  I would say that this kind of staff attitude does now entice me to use this restaurant again.
 
As a downtown facility, valet only is not unexpected.  The Adams Street entrance can get bogged down during a rush, and so there's an alternate valet entrance on 1st Street.  When I checked-in on Friday night, the valet told me not to bother calling ahead and to simply come to the desk if I need my car.  On Saturday, I went to the 1st Street valet area, and there was no one there, and so I had to go to the Adams Street valet.  On Sunday as I'm checking out at 8:00 AM, I went to the Adams Street area, and no valet.  And so I asked the surly frontdesk attendant whether valet was only operating on the 1st Street entrance.  At which point, I was asked whether I had called ahead.  No, I was specifically told by the valet not to call ahead.  If you're going to have valet only, then you should properly man the two stations so that a guest doesn't have to wander from one valet desk to another trying to retrieve one's car.  Also, if the standard is to have a guest call ahead for a car, then you should instruct the valets not to inform guest not to call ahead.
 
Lastly, I was given a room on the 6th floor that overlooks the outdoor patio lounging area.  Due to the McDowell Mountain Music Festival, I knew that the hotel was almost solidly booked, and so when I was given room 624, I knew asking to be moved would simply be futile.  Most places limit when outdoor lounges that are near guest rooms can be used.  Not at this Renaissance.  On Saturday night there was a business gathering that happened at this venue with live music.  Luckily this event wasn't too bad, and ended by 10:00 PM.  Finally, I can get some sleep.  Nope, at 3:00 AM once the local bars had closed, a bunch of relatively young people gathered on the patio to continue with their boisterous carousing.  It was noisy. When I woke up at 5:30 AM, there were drunk passed out men on the outdoor furniture. Renaissance, really?  This is a downtown property.  You don't police who has access to the patio?  You don't encourage patrons to act appropriately after hours?  This isn't a Las Vegas property!  If you want a quieter room, ask for an odd numbered room that faces Adams, or maybe a higher floor room.  624 was absolutely a bust for me."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not sure what this hotel looked like before the renovation, it is breathtaking now. The class in the luxury of this hotel surpasses many Luxury places I've stayed in. 

Let me first start off by saying. I needed a place to stay due to and unforeseen event. The location of this hotel is amazing. Plenty of things to do for the afternoon. 

I made a call ahead to see if there were any rooms even available to stay at this location. I spoke with Cora. She told me that the hotel was sold out the night before. However, after hearing of our predicament she did a rush on a room and got us in early by 9 o'clock.  

Check-in was a breeze, and was very professional friendly and warm. Merna took great care of us. Once up in our room, the phone rang. The voice on the phone with Cora making sure all of our expectations had been met. Her   warm gesture of making sure she could do anything within her power to make our day a perfect one was nothing less than amazing. She is five star all the way. 

After checking in and being very tired, we went to have breakfast and enjoyed another feature of this beautiful hotel. 

I just want to say a special thank you for making our trip and layover a good one. The next time I am back in Phoenix I know the first place I will look into when needing a room!"}
{"text":"I was booked to photograph a major ballet event in Phoenix. To my surprise they booked me this fabulous hotel as my accommodations. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The staff was welcoming and helpful. Food was interesting and yummy. I truly enjoyed walking around the entire hotel looking at all the decor and different sitting areas. It is so well done. Location is in the heart of everything. Here are a few of my favorite pics."}
{"text":"Great place to stay so adventure downtown.  Great staycation.  

The rooms were nice and the bathroom was amazing.  There is aa nice terrace and pool on the 5th floor with spices growing that they use in the restaurants. 

Staff friendly and helpfull"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff!! Best hotel in town. Food is absolutely delicious & original. I am amazed at how great each dish is at their restaurant! Rhonda is absolutely fabulous! :-) The A/V department sets up amazing displays! All around good hotel & service"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is ok. A bit of a tight squeeze in the walking areas. I guess I'm just spoiled by the enormous sizes of the casinos. Seems as if this resort is very much into local art which, I appreciate. It's a good feeling knowing a high end resort is putting energy back into the locals instead of disregarding them and focusing purely on visitors. The stairs could use a cleaning. lol"}
{"text":"A beautiful Marriott hotel that has been updated well. The rooms here are larger than traditional rooms and the beds are very comfortable. Close to everything in downtown Phoenix but for some it may be to close. On the weekends it can get rowdy so if that is not your style you may want to hit up the Renaissance in Glendale. I love the hotel though and the customer service is spectacular. They always aim to please and were always looking to help."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. I for once was eager and excited to go on a work trip. My second week back from maternity leave and had to travel, couldn't wait for a full nights rest in a hotel room. Check in after a long day of airplanes and meetings - bugs, hair and TOENAILS all over the floor of the room. Ew. Move me to another room. Weird stains and mold all over the shower curtain. Cherry on top of my night was that both the cable and Internet were down. 

Both disgusting and pathetic. I'd rather have slept in the rental car with my teething newborn screaming."}
{"text":"This was a lovely hotel.  The staff was very friendly.  I was offered access to their lounge on the 19th floor \"Elevate\".  The lounge was impressive.  Breakfast consisted of fresh blueberries, pineapple, raspberries etc... including savory items and pastries.  The lounge staff was incredible at Elevate.  I commented to one of the staff members, Albert, during snack time that I was gluten intolerant.  He told me to come back for appetizers at 5:30, the chef specially made me delicious gluten free sliders and min tacos.  Kudos to Albert!  I have worked in the hospitality industry for 14 years and it's the little touches and going the extra mile really makes your experience special.  So I would like to say thank you for making my stay special."}
{"text":"Nice property clean rooms very nice staff.  The beds are typical to Marriott or Renaissance fashion and very comfortable.  Parts of the hotel look like they may not of been remodeled.   But this has little impact for the most part I really like this hotel.  If I were staying here not on expense account, I would be upset by $27 nightly valet parking.  Location is great.  Walking distance to the USAirways center. They have one of the nicer concierge lounges with good drink options.  Depending on the rate can't really go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong this hotel has exceptional customer service, but they will nickel and dime you for everything. For example, the hotel doesn't provide parking so you're forced to pay a $29 daily valet fee if you decide to bring a vehicle.
Finally don't let them try and sell you one of their Downtown City View rooms. The room itself is nothing special, all it's is a room on an upper floor with a downtown view obscured by all of the taller buildings around it. So unless you enjoy staring at empty parking lots below, steer clear of those rooms. My advice to you, would be to stick with their standard rooms."}
{"text":"We had our wedding at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel and it was the best venue we could have chosen. 

We had the ceremony on the beautiful 5th floor terrace, looking out to all of the buildings downtown. Then we had the reception in the ballroom that had beautiful artwork on the walls that it didn't look like your standard ballroom.

From the beginning till the end of the night, the staff at the hotel were so helpful. Monique Rowe was priceless in helping us with all of the steps along the way.

All of our family and friends loved staying at the hotel and it was so convenient to be so close to everything around town."}
{"text":"Excellent property, very classy and clean.  I was upgraded to a suite.  GORGEOUS bathrooms.  My valet wasn't brought around in time once and they gave me a free ribeye steak dinner.  Great customer service.  I always am comfortable at The Renaissance."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place was fantastic! I stayed mid-July and this was by far my favorite hotel I've stayed in (I've been to many across the country for work).  I went to AZ for my birthday to see the Dodgers play the Dbacks.  Not only did they upgrade my room but they made my stay easy and comfortable with Cody giving me tips about the city! Keep up the good work and will be excited to stay here again when I am in town."}
{"text":"The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are comfortable and modern. The valet and wi-fi are a bit expensive but the location is ideal in downtown. The staff recommended good eats and we're generally helpful. 

One complaint is that there were no vending machines on any floor except the 5th. A small thing but when you need something to drink late in the evening it would be nice to just walk down the hall. 

Overall pleased."}
{"text":"The Renaissance is a great hotel in downtown Phoenix. They're currently under construction right now and it's kind of a cluster f at that 1st St and Adams intersection but it's not that bad.  They have mock ups of how the hotel facade is going to look and it looks promising, can't wait to see what the finished product will be.

There's only valet parking here.  Be sure to scan your ticket at the kiosk by the front door or have somebody help you scan it otherwise they might not know that you want your car.  Calling in your car might not always work.
They also have cold bottles of water considering it's Phoenix and it's hot out.

The rooms are nice, the water pressure is FANTASTIC in the showers. There's a concierge lounge on the top floor so be sure to check that out if you have gold/platinum status."}
{"text":"For a Renaissance hotel, this place is not up to snuff- it's an older hotel refurbished with nice new furnishings, but it suffers from unreliable elevators, walls that couple the sound between adjoining rooms exceptionally well, showerheads so short that you need to be 5'4\" to get your head under the showerhead without bending over, and a fitness room that is well-equipped with treadmills, reasonably equipped with weight machines, but very sorely lacking in terms of square footage and free weights.  The hotel staff are very very nice people who work very hard to make you happy, but despite having status with Marriott's Rewards program, I will stay someplace else the next trip I take to Phoenix.  There is literally no comparison between this Renaissance and other Renaissance hotels- I am very disappointed after my previous Renaissance stays in other cities."}
{"text":"Nothing but praise for the facilities and staff at this awesome hotel!  I normally don't like the Renaissance brand of hotels (or anything in the Marriott family for that matter), as they lack character and all feel a bit like they're trapped in the late 90s or early 2000, but this recently remodeled hotel is definitely a mark above most.  Not only were the rooms clean and spacious, but the staff was extremely accommodating - we had a cooler full of half eaten food we needed to get rid of before heading to the airport and the very friendly front desk agent took it from our trunk to the dumpster -- all while he was in a suit and had a smile on his face!  I don't think I'll find myself in Phoenix anytime soon, but would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere downtown."}
{"text":"I would like to pass on my gratitude to the Phoenix Marriott Renaissance for making our anniversary and amazing experience! Dora Jackson and Jose (sorry, no last name - worked as a bartender and server), made the experience even more special and personal. I cannot tell you how amazing our weekend was and we will make sure we tell everyone. The staff, location, accessibility to downtown and level of care was unbelievable! Dora - we loved the bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"This hotel is very aware of what they do well and what they need to improve. Staff is attentive and shows great service, consistently. Great location for downtown. Very clean and great quality good. The Chef and team are creative and push the appropriate limits to provide a visual and taste experience to remember."}
{"text":"Very nice place to stay , rooms r beautiful,  love free apples and fruit water during the day.  Only thing I don't like about the rooms is that the walls are paper thin , I could hear a full blown conversation with the people that were staying next to me, so if u have a lady freind staying with you here its best to use a pillow"}
{"text":"Located in downtown Phoenix, this hotel is a great place to meet after hours during a conference at the convention center.  It's only a couple of blocks away and I have come here often to meet clients in the lobby to have a few drinks and go over contracts and proposals.

Being a local resident, I've never stayed in the rooms and can only comment on the public areas.  The lobby has a cool, modern look to it.  Very clean and upscale.  It's the perfect vibe for conducting business and gets them in the mood to get the deal done.  I've found that the vibe/decor of a meeting place can help or hurt your business deals and can affect people's attitude towards the subject matter being discussed.  The reason why I give this place 4 Stars is because in my experience they've helped me through a few successful negotiations and my clients have always commented on how nice the staff and hotel rooms are.  The lobby has several areas where you can conduct business and maintain a semi-private conversation while remaining comfortable.  That's key to me.

As long as this place continues to deliver the goods, I'll keep coming back.  When the other hotels closer to the convention center sell out, I always recommend this place as an alternative to clients visiting from out of town.  So far, it hasn't disappointed them and that means I'm happy too.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"They know how to throw a party!  We crashed a party there recently, very friendly people, well thought out lobby with excellent decor.  I'd do it again."}
{"text":"Great price, clean and recently updated.  Rooms are moderate size with the usual accompaniments."}
{"text":"Typical Marriott Renaissance hotel in downtown Phoenix.  Interesting furnishing, too funky for my taste...too many geometric patterns in furnishing.  It does have a very nice lounge and friendly staff.  Renaissance is the higher line of the Marriott and tend to be more conservative...but not this location."}
{"text":"I love the staff at this hotel! I brought my
Whole company here for a convention. It was located walking distance to the convention center and they staff was extremely helpful. The dry cleaners actually lost my dry cleaning and the staff was super helpful in helping me get my dry cleaning back. Toni, the front desk agent, went out of her way to assist me with my issue and gave me the kind of personal attention I typically expect from much more expensive hotels. She really made a potentially stressful situation easy on me and my assistant who were already busy with a lot of other things. That's the kind of thing that will bring me back! My overall experience was excellent. The rooms were very nice and the amenities were great, but the staff s what makes it special."}
{"text":"The new remodel of this place looks amazing. Really great service! The Bartender Rebecca took really good care of us and had great recommendations."}
{"text":"This is a great hotel physically and service wise. The people that staff this hotel are really helpful and truly do have great customer service. Before I could even hunt down someone to ask a question they immediately offer their assistance. That's great customer service. 

The hotel is very clean and super spacious. I was honored to have a suite. Hurray for me! The location is great in the heart of downtown phoenix where there is plenty going on and I felt safe walking out by myself to look for delicious Yelp reviewed food. (In daylight!!!!) 

I would highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for basic room, might as well go to the marriot courtyard for better price... and you wont get nickel and dimed 13 bucks a night for wifi, 30 bucks to park, tip valet, tip door guy who would not take no for an answer, and the ac doesn't even work."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel to be close to the airport. Although the airport is only 8 miles away (and the rental car place is really close), it isn't the right accommodations for the airport. It's really best suited for one who wants to enjoy downtown Phoenix. I was told that the room was renovated. It was a nice size room and it was quiet but here are my issues: 1) the towels were nice but were frayed and had strings hanging off them 2) the vent by the clean towels in the bathroom was filthy. I actually cleaned it myself, 3) the wallpaper looked new but was stained and coming off the wall. My biggest frustrations were caused by the fact that there was no self parking but they charge you $30 for valet. That MAKES NO SENSE. If you have no self-parking option, you shouldn't charge me $30 p/day. Also, there is no hotel shuttle to the airport. They have a flat rate of $15 but I was already paying for the parking. I had hoped to get rid of my rental car to avoid one more day of charges but the math didn't work. I'm used to Renaissance hotels to be one of the bests of the brands. I didn't have that experience at the Renaissance Phoenix downtown."}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Renaissance in downtown Phoenix three times, most recently in December.  Except for the Ritz Carlton, the downtown Renaissance is my favorite hotel in the Valley.  Beside being a modern hotel with great room service, the area nearby has restaurants, architecture, and is nice if you like to go for a run outside (in a Arizona winter at least).  I'll stay again."}
{"text":"I can not recommend staying here. Only two of four elevators are working. If you are here for a conference, plan on waiting 30-45 minutes to get to your room. Even under ideal conditions, it'll take 5-10 minutes to get an elevator. Another Yelp review from 4 months ago said they were working on the elevators back then and would be ready by fall. Well it's fall and they're still not working!"}
{"text":"Drink all day, play all night, let's get it bumpin'! We're in Phoenix, Trick!

Here's what I think about this hotel.

Pros:
1. Centralized location in downtown Phoenix. It's close to Arizona State University, Phoenix Convention Center, Chase Baseball Field, US Airways Arena...etc. It's also close to bars, clubs, and other nightlife activities.

2. Close to public Transportation - Right across the street from the hotel is the Light Rare (3.50/day to majority of the city and to Scottsdale)

3. Friendly Staff. Bruce from the Concierge Desk was really helpful in finding us stuff to do in the area. 

4. Food - The hotel gave us complimentary breakfast buffet (Marriott Gold Perk) in the morning at Mastro's Cafe. They serve a pretty high quality buffet that runs 17/person. It didn't make me feel so bad about the valet parking.

5. Renovated - Newly renovated in all the right places. The rooms are nicely done and so is the lobby. Really posh. The corridors need work though. 

Cons:
1. Work in progress - It looks like they're working as quickly as they can to give this place a facelift. The lobby is really nice, the rooms are freshly renovated, but the corridors smell old like grandma.

2. Parking - Valet only and 23/night. That's excluding the 3 dollar tax they hit you with for parking there. Ouch!

Overall, I thought this place was pretty good. It might be a little on the pricy side, but you'll get your money's worth. I would probably come back, if I'm ever in Phoenix again. Here's a secret for Marriott Gold Members. If you go up to 18th floor, they have unguarded snacks (cookies, trail mix, candy, etc) and beverages (sodas, bottled water, juice, Arizona Ice Teas, Coffees, etc.) laying around. *winky*

A little about my credentials:
I just an average joe, that travels a lot for business and pleasure. I'm an Elite Premier member for United, Gold Member for Marriott, and Gold Member for Hilton Honors Reward. I usually book hotels in the range of 130-160/night depending on location, amenities, and the year the hotel was built/renovated. I'm a pretty reasonably easy person to cater and I don't have very high expectations out of anyone."}
{"text":"This hotel deserves a 0. But since that is not an option its getting a 1. I was gonna be a guest at the hotel for an amazon conference and when i could not pay for the room cause my cards are froze. The cards can have 1 million bucks on them but if theyre froze its not gonna work. I was escorted off property like a criminal and that is something i did not appreciate at all. I can still attend the amazon conference which is cool. Peoples cards are declined for more then just money. They can be froze, expired, etc. Not all declines are money related. Its about high time people realizes that."}
{"text":"Front desk: First impression: Not so good. The lady who checked us in could've at least put a smile on her face or pretend she was happy. It did not give me a good vibe of the staff. I had a few questions with the location and where to find restaurants and she could've given me a map, but didn't. She gave me street names as if I were suppose to know where it is right off the back. Our hotel room was nice but with a terrible view of an abandoned building. No one wants to be looking out a window at an abandoned building. 

Comes 8:45pm and we get a knock on the door of a NOISE COMPLAINT. Ok, first of all, there were only three of us in the room. We had music coming from our PHONES not even the radio they had in the room. And that was a NOISE complaint? Really? At least what they could've done was tell the people who are complaining that it's still early and if it goes on after 11pm, then they can come and tell us something, but seriously, that early and a Friday night? That did it for me right there. I'm never coming back to this hotel. The service is terrible.

Location sucks too. Only good thing is it's next to the light rail. Other than that, no good restaurants nearby. I would the extra bucks to stay elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel for a little mini vacation this past weekend to attend a Sharks vs. Coyotes hockey game and I absolutely LOVED the hotel!  From the moment we arrived, the valet attendants were friendly and directed us to check-in.  Once we got to the check-in desk, we were once again greeted by a warm and friendly young man.  I did the mobile check-in on the way over, so our room on the 14th floor was ready when we arrived at 3:30pm on Friday.  We went up to our room and it was beautiful and spacious.  We frequently stay at other Renaissance properties, but this one is truly one of the best!  The bed was so comfy!  Parking was a little pricey, but expected for the downtown location.  Plus there are several restaurants and bars within walking distance to the hotel, so once you valet, you don't have to worry about moving or getting a taxi or Uber.  Oh and the hotel gym is AMAZING!  All of the equipment is top of the line and in excellent condition.  They have water, towels, and even apples for fitness minded guests like myself in mind.   I will definitely stay at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel when I return to Phoenix next year."}
{"text":"I stayed here for one night for an event here in Phoenix recently and wow, the sponsor that put us in this hotel has some taste because this was probably one of the nicest hotels in the downtown area. This was luxury. Valet is fairly priced when you first pull up. They were courteous and helpful. We walked in with our luggage and the aesthetic of this building was just beautiful. We walked up to the front desk and checked in and got our room keys. They had ID verification at the elevators which made me feel good knowing how secure it was. Got to our room on the 8th floor and was astounded! Large room with two beds, bathroom, tv and great view. Went to our event in style and came back in style. Had to tie a tie and since I don't know how, one of the people helping with elevator security helped me tie it! Very friendly and helpful! After the even we went to the bar downstairs. Ordered food and drinks and although they took a long time to get, it was worth it! If you're looking for a luxurious stay in Downtown Phoenix, THIS is the place to go! 

Pros: 
luxury looking hotel for fair prices (during off season)
safe and secure
great hospitality
early check in and late check out on request
every staff member was great
food was delicious

Cons:
daily internet fee if purchased, no free wifi, slow internet
slow restaurant service
pool was really small"}
{"text":"Location was great for travelers.  It took us about 10 minutes to arrive from the rental car center at the airport. There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby. Mostly chainey though. Also walking distance to the baseball stadium and basketball arena. We arrived after 11pm and there were still tons of people still walking around. 

Lobby was modern and swanky looking.  The man at the front desk was very nice and checked us in quickly. Unlike the man at the front desk the next morning who acted like he couldn't be bothered to talk to us. 

We were in room 1722. Its a handicapped accessible room, so its larger, but the shower is a bit odd in that there's no tub and has just a curtain around it. Reminds of the showers at the gym. But there are lots of safety grab bars, to help keep you safe for all your showering activities ;-) 

Another downside to the room is its right next to the elevators and you can hear it every time it stops on the floor.

Also, parking is pricey.  $30 valet only."}
{"text":"This is actually no longer the Wyndham, it is a Renaissance now. While the hotel looks nice and the rooms are modernly decorated, the walls are PAPER THIN. I always expect a little bit of noise staying in a hotel, but when the person in the next room is talking at a normal volume at 2am, I shouldn't wake up thinking there is a person in my room. Every word said in the neighboring rooms could be heard, including the \"you look sexy in red...\" conversation. Even though I have no complaints about the other aspects of my stay, I wouldn't stay here again. 

Also, Wi-fi is $13 a day."}
{"text":"I love the Renaissance brand of hotels with their classy elegance added to the Marriott brand's practicality. This one had a lovely lobby with an adjacent wine bar that looked very sleek and modern. However, once we stepped into the elevators, the hotel started to reveal its true age. The rooms were decent but obviously well worn. The service we received from the staff was acceptable, but nothing special. I did not visit any of the restaurants but we did order room service for breakfast. Those ricotta pancakes the other reviewers raved about were not all that. They also only gave us one set of silverware and and one cup even though we ordered a large pot of coffee and two entrees. Hello?

I think the Hyatt or Westin nearby would be better options if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Phoenix. Especially if you want to use the pool. The one here was very lame and had no amenities whatsoever. They also charged you to use their wi-fi. I hate it when hotels do that."}
{"text":"I was here last week for a 90-person meeting for three nights and four days. Our meetings lasted about 8 hours during the day, and for two nights, we were also served dinner at the hotel. I am unable to speak to the cost of the room as this was billed directly to another company, but I am sure it was a pretty penny compared to (let's say) Choice hotels. 

Nonetheless, the rooms were nice. They were clean and modernly streamlined. The armoire is in the bathroom across from the kitchen sink, which is a different kind of layout for me. This makes sense so that you can see yourself in the mirror, but I feel it would've been a bit cramped if you have someone at the sink and someone else opening the armoire doors (less than a couple of feet from the sink when opened). There was a mini fridge, tv, desk, and lounge chair. Outlets were on available on one side of the bed; as I was solo, this was fine.

I had concierge lounge access as a Marriott Gold member. I had to add this twice to my room at the front desk, which was inconvenient. The first time my room key worked, but the lounge access did not. The second time the lounge access worked, but my room did not. Finally on my third trip to the front desk, the lady said she would put my key in \"override\" mode and not tie my key to a reservation. My key worked for both after that.

The concierge lounge food was pretty decent. A co-worker was in a crunch to get reports done, so I invited her to dinner there. It was very convenient for her to eat in the hotel instead of finding a place to eat at a restaurant. BBQ chicken (think it was baked, but the glaze was good and chicken moist), potato salad, and normal salad were on the menu, as well as a variety of cookies, non-alcoholic beverages, and antipasti (salami, ham, roasted veggies, etc). Unlike most lounges, this one has takeout Chinese-style boxes and plasticware in case you are unable to stay and eat. Happy hour is also available from 5-6PM. Beer and wine are $4; well drinks are $5. The lounge will take cash, credit/debit card, or you can charge to your room. Blane is my favorite in the lounge and a hard worker - hopefully Marriott recognizes this and will keep him around for a very long time!

Breakfast in the concierge lounge was also pretty good - eggs, bacon, and potatoes were usually served. One morning there was some sort of frittatas, but I prefer the bacon. It was so good, I took a plate of it back to my room for munching LOL! The hotel did not mind either. I tweeted about it (they RTed), and they were in agreement that there was no shame in taking extra bacon! The wall street journal, USA Today, and a local paper are also available. For the room and lounge access alone, I would have given four stars.

However, the meeting food was not as great, hence the three stars. The first breakfast we had consisted of hard and rubbery Canadian bacon, which made me instantly regret not getting normal bacon in the lounge earlier that morning (hence the plateful later on). I should have known this was indicative of the subsequent meals. For one of the dinners, we were served limp, cold tacos, and the churros were also hard and cold. I am truly spoiled by having good Tex-Mex available at all times in Houston. I like my churros hot out the fryer LOL! Another breakfast, there was American bacon, but it was so spicy (most likely a jalapeño style), I requested milk. The lady apparently had to go elsewhere to get the milk. I felt bad but was surprised normal milk wasn't unavailable in the kitchen next to the meeting room (where staff were coming in and out). Oh well, I really needed it!

In addition, the audio and visual for the meeting wasn't always on point. For one of our smaller meetings, we needed a microphone, and there wasn't anyone available at all. For a portion of the bigger meeting, one of the presenters had an issue getting her own laptop to show on the presentation screen, and it took quite a long time to do this, about 10 minutes. That doesn't seem like a long time, but when you're only allotted 30 minutes, 10 minutes is a long time!

If I ever stay in downtown Phoenix, I would not mind coming back. I think I would have more fun as a guest, not a meeting attendee. Definitely try to get lounge access if you can!"}
{"text":"Very nice hotel! Just a few comments regarding check in, elevators, lobby restrooms, and not much happening for New Year's Eve. We went there again this year for New Years. Had an unwelcoming experience with no communication as to hotel accommodations, breakfast, New Years dinner, the pool, internet etc until I asked. Several elevators were not working and were very slow. Hotel lobby bathrooms were closed all evening,  making us go to our room to use the facilities. Very inconvient. With it being New years, I would have staffed the hotel bar with more staff. Also better advertisements as to specials for New Years etc. Had more fun experiencing local bars! Hotel staff were not very friendly."}
{"text":"The nicest group
Of people I have ever met. I would like to mention a few. Floyd greeted us and provided us with all the info I had asked for. Jonathan and Michael were awesome.  They work valet and always greeted us with a smile and info. Jesse Perry is such a 
Sweetheart. Not only did he provide me with the info I needed with kids activities in the area, but offered to get my daughters hat that we left at a restaurant.
Michael mcConaghy helped me pick out a pair of earrings in the gift shop. He was so warm and helpful and a tremendous asset to the gift shop!"}
{"text":"Stayed here in August.  I am on a traveling project for a client in Phoenix.  I have been traveling weekly for about 2 months now and looking for my one hotel.  I enjoyed my stay here but there was 2 things missing on my essential list.  No fresh orange juice in the club lounge breakfast.  Only bottled Tropicana.  The 2nd was the bathroom needs an update.  I like showers instead of tubs and the speakerman shower head is pretty standard.  I really like the Aveda bath products."}
{"text":"I stayed at this Renaissance back when it first became a Marriott property..and then again recently. I have to say that it has come a LONG way! It is a very typical Renaissance as far as decoration and style goes. Great lobby. I was upgraded to a suit and I have to say that it was exceptional. Modern and great decorating. Because I stay over 100 nights a year at Marriott properties, I had access to the lounge on the 19th floor and I have to say that the lounge was the nicest lounge I have experience at a Marriott property. Not only because it was modern, clean, and very well equipped and decorated, but the evening food that they put out was 2 steps about what you would usually get. Breakfast was pretty straight forward, but even it was presented in a way that seemed more upscale. If you are going to stay downtown Phoenix, you can't do better!"}
{"text":"Great decor. Maybe my favorite is the flavored Fresh cold water in the lobby.   Bathroom could use some bleach around tub area.   Comfortable bed.  Great location"}
{"text":"Very clean and fabulous location hotel. I stay here quite a bit with business and im always welcomed with a genuine smile from personnel. Especially Bernard who works at the front desk. He has a special approach he gives to his customers! Renissance are lucky to have such a hard working staff working for them.. Will definitely be back on a personnel vacation
Great deck outside near the pool love the herb garden nice touch :)"}
{"text":"Stayed 4 days/3 nights for Phoenix Comic Con, and they were very accommodating. We asked to check in early, and they got us in right away. Answered all of our questions, any service we called up to the room came quickly, all the staff we came in contact with was very friendly, and of course the rooms were nice. The thing that really won me over, though, was when it was time to check out. Their bag storage was full, and we were going to be in the city for several more hours, so they asked us when we were planning on leaving and extended our check out time to then. The only down side was their elevators, which I saw was getting renovated soon anyways!
Their service (plus the proximity to the convention center) means I will definitely be coming back next year!"}
{"text":"A beautiful hotel and excellent service. Nick from the front was very accommodating to all of our needs. We were there for a cheer competition and of course the girls forgot stuff so he got us needed items and suggested places to pick up the rest. The rooms were very nice and extremely clean. The only reason I gave it four stars is the parking situation.  No onsite parking except vallet which is 30.00 a night. Makes it difficult when staying downtown, but I'm assuming this is the case with most of the hotels in the area. The shop there has all most everything you could need and having the cafe is very convenient.  The food from toom service is excellent and the Terrance and pool area are a great place to gather with friends or relax. I definitely will be back and highly  recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"Amazing time! Great location and very friendly staff. Rooms are modern and the room service (get the pizza) was actually amazing!!!!!! Great price for what you get!!!!! Very impressed."}
{"text":"The room is spacious and there are major renovations going on.... so this hotel will be even better in the coming year or two. The staff have been friendly and seem competent except for the girl at the front desk who doesn't realize that we have enough points not to have to pay for internet service. Oh well. We'll deal with that later. The bed is almost really comfortable....hopefully new mattresses are in the works, but I would stay here again."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Loved this hotel very much. The rooms were beautiful and clean. But the staff are the ones who made my stay amazing. They were extremely friendly and even held my son and played with him while I loaded up the car. Room service was fast and delicious. The only minor blunder is that the new tvs don't have Disney Channel which one needs when traveling with a one year old. But you can connect your Netflix or any other internet tvs service. So it's a tv wash. Will definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Nice place. Seems the nicer the Marriott the more expensive the Internet connection fee. However there is a Starbucks close by and Internet is free there. 

Rooms were in great shape and the bed was  very comfortable. Decor was modern but not artsy. 

Great for business travel as long as the firm is paying."}
{"text":"We stayed here one night after seeing a concert at Talking Stick Arena so we wouldn't have an hour+ drive home. Everyone was very friendly. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are modern and spacious. They have the most comfortable beds and pillows of any hotel I've stayed at. I wish we would have realized their breakfast place was a buffet before it was too late. We had dinner at their 50's restaurant and my steak was delicious and cooked perfectly. There was even a demonstration on how to make one of their cocktails and they passed out samples. It's just a short distance to the arena. 

The only negatives were the fact internet access is around $14/day and the only option for parking is $30 valet. I thought about giving it 4 stars, but decided on 5 because our valet went above and beyond! When he brought our car out, the tire went flat - this was by no means the hotels fault, we had previously patched the tire and knew we had to buy a new one soon. Our valet directed my husband to a safe spot in the garage so he could change the tire. When my husband realized the spare was low, I started trying to find the nearest gas station. The valet said he might be able to find an air compressor. He took off running and was gone at least 10 mins - I have no idea where he went or if he borrowed it from nearby construction workers, but he returned with an air compressor! We were so grateful that he helped us with a very stressful (and possibly dangerous attempt to get to a gas station) situation. He could have very easily just gone back to work and left us to figure it out. Excellent service and kindness outweighs the 2 small things."}
{"text":"I was recently in Phoenix for a 2-day business trip and chose to stay at the Renaissance because of it's proximity to where I needed to be in the afternoons and because they had competitive rates compared to the hotels in the surrounding area. 

When I arrived, I was welcomed by very warm staff offering to take my bags and check me in. After passing over my ID/CC for incidentals, I was unfortunately greeted by a manager who informed me that they were actually oversold and didn't have a room available for the first night. They offered me a meeting room space w/ a roll-away cot for the evening-- I accepted having been so tired from a long day of flying.

It was a really uncomfortable night with quite a bit of tossing and turning. However, they comped me the night and offered me access to their elevate lounge for my entire stay at the top of the hotel. It was absolutely beautiful and I cannot begin to tell you how amazing the staff were. They were extremely polite, friendly and personable and because of them, you might see me back at the Renaissance. 

My second night, I received a room. It wasn't anything special, but just what I needed."}
{"text":"The customer service here was great!! Was in town for my boyfriends birthday and they made it extra special for him by sending up a card signed by all the staff AND a cheesecake with ice cream. I would stay here again in a heart beat just because of the friendliness alone. The hotel itself was very nice, clean and modern. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Renaissance Hotels are a very cool brand by Marriott. This hotel is in the heart of downtown Phoenix, Arizona. From the second you drive up to the entrance, you feel a freshness/almost a sexiness in the air.  The lobby is very very modern.   The hallways are very wide and the rooms are very big.  The concierge level on the 18th floors beautiful too.  I have stayed here a few times and I am a Marriott lifetime platinum member. If in Phoenix, stay here."}
{"text":"test rating for my personal use. I am a novice yelp user and please dont consider this as rating of the restaurant. I just want to test out yelp and see if i want to use it in the future."}
{"text":"Wow!!   Best looking interior of any marriott hotel!  So unique and different.  Love every inch of it. Well, except the elevator decor, not understanding the cut out jeans and cowboy boots but what do I know?   The hotel staff was accommodating and friendly.  Will be on my saved list of Marriott hotels to stay while in phoenix."}
{"text":"My experience here was great! The staff was so friendly and everything was very clean!  I did have a maintenance issue in my room, but it was fixed immediately and the staff apologized so much for the issue (which was a very minor issue). 

Service was far beyond what I had expected.  I would recommend this if you are traveling to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"my stay was less than stellar. the staff was aloof, minus one really nice bell boy trying to help everyone. i stood at the check in desk while 1 employee shuffled papers without acknowledging me. i figured he wasn't checking people in, but then after a few minutes he looked up and asked if i was checking in. room was nice, but just had a scuffed up old fridge in the corner of the room on the floor. stood out next to the nice decor. i didn't have a room service menu in the room, didnt have a hair dryer. when i went to the bar after a long day of work, the bartender moved me away from the bar saying the other guest next to me has had too much to drink. i guess i appreciated the gesture, but how about sending him to his room or home instead of letting him take up valuable space at the bar? i ordered my drink from the server. waited about 15 mins as she passed by a few times. (there were only 3 other single tables in the whole place) so i just got up and left. she looked at me as i did and said nothing.  customer service is everything these days and they were really lacking. i went to a hotel bar across the street the next night and had amazing attentive service. maybe next time ill stay there to get a little more attention when paying $200+ a night."}
{"text":"We stay here for layovers as airline crew.  It is a clean, quiet hotel.  Many rooms have been updated with nice linens, Aveda toiletries & flat screen tvs.  Outdoor pool is normally in the shade of the building.  :(  Good size gym with plenty of modern cardio equipment, 5-6 weight machines & some free weights.  The mexican food restaurant across the street, The Matador, is not good!  Their is one a few blocks away called Sams Cafe on 3rd that is great!  Nice patio, great chips & salsa.  The concierge can give you a map.

There is a CVS drug store a few blocks away in case you forget any toiletries."}
{"text":"I'm a Platinum Premier Elite super-duper Marriott guest and they treated me very well. Upgraded room, concierge access which includes nighttime food, deserts, full hot breakfast and all the benefits. The hotel is currently going through a light exterior facelift, which will make it much more modern looking, but the interior is exceptional. Everything is done very nicely. The appointments to the bedroom are sleek and modern, lots of outlets for phones and USBs, and the bathrooms are very nice.

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the lack of jacuzzi next the the pool. After a long drive, the pool felt great but my aching back needed a jet. 

But I will be back. Great service and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a work conference. The location was awesome - heart of downtown and walkable to lots of attractions. My BFF stayed with me so we had a rented car to drive around. When we checked in, we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff. He offered us bottled water and our keys to the room.

The room is spacious and we had a great view of the city. The room was also comfortable, clean and quiet. We didn't have any issues with neighbors being loud. I think our floor had people who were attendees of the conferences that this hotel hosted. 

I had called previously to check if the room had a microwave and fridge. When I spoke with the check in staff, the lady mentioned that only certain rooms have microwaves. I respectfully requested that a microwave was available to place in my room. When we arrived to our room, there was a microwave! NICE!

My conference was great and the food served was really good. Great place to stay in the heart of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The service at this hotel is what makes it 5 star.  From the moment I arrived until I left I was greeted, smiled at, helped, and treated like a valued customer by every employee.  The concierge/navigator that I met (didn't get his name - sorry) was awesome, not only telling me about local finds, but also AZ history.  It is a great location to convention center and nearby restaurants.  The lobby is trendy.  The rooms are clean.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Kelsey the Manager is wonderful. We moved our grad school daughter there tonight for her conference  after a gun wielding thug robbed the motel she was trying to check in to. Kelsey gave her the conference rates and personally delivered complimentary hot chocolate and desert. She wrote a had written note from  us that we loved our daughter because she was so shaken by the witnessed robbery at the other place. Top notch service. Thank you."}
{"text":"The staff are super nice and so helpful. The beds are very comfortable. The rooms are getting renovated but still are nice. There are a lot of good restaurants to choose from close by. And it actually rained when we were going out to eat, ;luckily had an umbrella. The hotel is being worked on and I had to sleep during the day but I didnt hear any construction which was nice."}
{"text":"The last couple of years I have stayed in quite a few Marriott hotels thanks to ongoing conferences, and this weekend was the best experience I had. The room was clean and smelled fresh, the air conditioning was quiet, the bed was comfortable (well, as comfortable as one would expect!) and even though the hallways scream 1960s, I even liked the low ceilings because I've never felt so tall. ;)

The staff though is the true gem of this hotel. Every time I asked for something, it was dealt with immediately - I never had to ask twice, and I never got to the point of looking around wondering where someone else was to ask my request of again. They were genuinely friendly, and seemed happy to help rather than that \"I've been told to be cheerful by my boss\" happy you often see.

From the front desk, to the concierge, to the gift shop, to the cleaning staff, to the chef (who I didn't meet but who was sweet enough to share a recipe with me when asked!) ... I was delighted with the reception I received. 

Also, the food served at our meetings was amazing. I mean, I love southwestern foods so that helped, but really I am afraid to get on the scale due to how much I ate. 

My only complaint was that they only carry Pepsi products - and I'm sorry but a rum & pepsi just doesn't go down the way rum & coke does."}
{"text":"I'm here with my company Bridge Property Management. The room I'm in is 1127, super comfy bed, pillows, and linens. My room is clean and in good condition. The staff here is so friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was great! The guy helping our table at breakfast kept my coffee cup full gave me a to-go cup full of coffee as well. Super great!"}
{"text":"I honestly cried when I checked out. I spent my birthday weekend here. A staycation. I had done some work for the hotel, and got a room for two nights as pay. (This means I didn't pay $$ for it. It wouldn't have made a difference of my review, though. I would have paid for this!)
I had arranged for a happy hour gathering with friends. I barely got out of my car at the valet, before I heard people telling me \"Happy birthday, Amy!\" (Some said \"Fab,\" too.) I got the cutest birthday card, too. Make sure you tell them if it's a special occasion! 
I was checked in promptly and when I walked into the room, it just felt really comfortable.
The decor and furnishings are masculine, but not overbearingly so. I had a leather wall!!!! The first thing I tested, of course, was the bed. Super comfy with tons of pillows. It was just me, so I drowned in pillows.
There's a nice working area as well, with wifi. It's $12/day, which is what other hotels charge, too. I had no problems with the speed or connectivity, either.
The staff here is nothing short of amazing. As soon as I asked for something, I got it.
I ate at both Marston's and the ICON lounge, and the food was amazing!  The chef uses some of his grandmother's recipes, and they've certainly stood the test of time.
The Renaissance also uses locally-produced food as much as possible. Tammie Coe, anyone? They are ambassadors to Downtown Phoenix, and out-of-towners will always get great advice on things to do while in the area.
Go check it out. Spend some time there. Oh, and say hi to Rhonda in the ICON lounge. She's worked there for over 30 years!"}
{"text":"Something cool about being in downtown Phoenix in the summer! Great room, kind hospitality, best part is the kinkos downstairs and elevate lounge which is their concierge lounge. Tons of space in the lounge, hip and thoughtful design, generous offerings for breakfast and evening. Never saw the dessert spread and snaps to Ben for scoring gluten free toast and goodies! 
Also the work out area is well appointed and their entire team is very careful in taking care of guests as enthusiastically as possible. Small note to Marriott - a fragrance in cleaning products that i have noticed from several past stays....too fake floral...would love a less fragrancy vibe!"}
{"text":"Great Hotel downtown Phoenix!
I'm very impress with their concierge lounge quality and best of all its staffing = Top notch!
They remember my name every time I came by."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful hotel! Staying here for work and the staff are so friendly! Gavin the bartender makes a delicious cucumber fizz Gerald! Gorgeous lobby, comfortable bed, all around great place to rest your head!"}
{"text":"Love this hotel. Stayed here because my business booked it for me. Fell in love with the decor. It just has a great energy here. The staff is super friendly as well. There are crystals throughout, open bar concept with open outdoor view. Real animal fur rugs. This hotel looks how I decorate my house. It's beautiful!"}
{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location, Wonderful Staff

We stayed here two nights when in town for the RnR Marathon.  Upon check-in I was asked how my travel to town had been and I shared my hectic morning with some flight delay frustration, but glad to be in Phoenix.   

A little while later there was a knock on the door where a delivery of fresh fruit and sparkling water with the nicest hand-written note from the hotel reception contact, Dominique.  This is more than customer service, this is true hospitality.  She made sure not only her hotel made me feel welcome, but her city as well.  She even remembered me the next day after the marathon and asked about how it went.  I hope this establishment knows what a gem they have on their staff. 

The room was very clean and Aveda toiletry products are always a win in my book, they smell divine.  My husband had breakfast at the hotel and said it was the best bacon he had probably ever had.  Oh and a Starbucks in the lobby....hooray!  Overall excellent experience.  

Every single person we encountered at this hotel, from reception/check-in, dining, and housekeeping were very friendly and very helpful  If only every hotel experience could be this wonderful.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I booked a 3-night weekend stay at this hotel but decided to check out after just one night. I arrived late in the evening and had to wait 20 minutes to checkin because the front desk was in the middle of their night audit. It's located in a lifeless, boring area in downtown Phoenix. There's hardly anything worth seeing near the hotel. I also needed to print something and was surprised to find out they don't have computers for guest use - they directed me to a Fedex office in their building where I had to pay per minute to use the computer and more than $1 to print a single page (total cost of more than $3 to print one page). The rooms are spacious and comfortable, but this is very much a convention hotel targeted at the business traveler. Find another hotel in Scottsdale or Tempe if you're on personal travel."}
{"text":"Cocktails on point! The bartender was fabulous, we had a long convo on about Sazarac's. He knows his stuff. Great setting ! (Valentine's Day)"}
{"text":"We were in town for my Daughter's graduation from ASU and since she was a participant in the Starbucks College Achievement Program and this was the Starbuck headquarters for their events we booked two nights here. 
From the first moment we drove up to the valet to the moment we departed the hotel everyone was very friendly and attentive.
I don't think I walked past any hotel staff that didn't take a moment to say hello. 
Room was ready when we arrived, and was clean and neat, We had breakfast at Marston's in the lobby and the food was great and reasonably priced, we had dinner at the Dust Cutter bar and it too was very good and again reasonably priced. 
As part of the Starbucks partner's graduation events they hosted a Partner's Forum in one of the ballrooms and they had hors d'oeuvres that were very good, the staff was running back and forth to make sure that none of the platters got empty and everyone had plenty to eat.
Very nice property with on-site dinning and drinking establishments, centrally located and a great staff. Hard to ask for anything more.
Highly recommend and next time I am in the area I would not hesitate to stay at this location again."}
{"text":"This is an exceptionally nice hotel in downtown Phoenix close to all major attractions.  The room was spacious, quiet, and nicely furnished. The staff were very attentive and the lobby, fitness area, and restaurant and bar were very attractive and comfortable. I would not hesitate to stay here again."}
{"text":"Great experience. We were at the hotel for 5 days. Staff was extremely accommodating and some of the most friendly that we have seen in our travels. Although under a renovation you would almost not know it. I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Ottimo Hotel. Posizione favolosa. Ottimo anche il ristorante a prezzi accessibilissimi. 2 burritos e 2 birre 50$"}
{"text":"The Renaissance is a great hotel in downtown Phoenix. Excellent service, as expected. Nice, large room with pretty view of the city."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Renaissance on a recent business trip and I was impressed by the hotel. The staff was super friendly and I was pleasantly surprised that there's a signature cocktail served every evening at 6pm. Whatever cocktail I had tasted just ok but hey, it was free!

The standard room was a good size and had everything I needed. The only downside is that the Internet was so slow. I had to take a quiz via email for class and I almost wasn't able to send it back to my professor in time because I had trouble sending the attachment. 

The gym was really nice for a hotel. The cardio machines are hybrid, which I thought was really cool. Apparently, my pedaling of the elliptical saved several minutes of electricity. It was also open 24 hours a day for the convenience of guests. I would certainly stay at the Renaissance again if I an ever in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This hotel was very good.  The service was fantastic and the room I had was truly great.  The only two things that kept it from getting a 5* rating were the restaurant and the location.  First, I tried the restaurant for breakfast and it was just \"ok\".  Very expensive buffett and there were not many items and those that were there looked like they had been there a while.  They also could not process credit cards when i was leaving and they asked me to sign a blank receipt - of course I was not going to do that. 

The second item, nothing they can do about it, was the location.  For some reason I remember downtown Phoenix to be much better than it was.  It is really not a very nice city. 

So, if you have to stay downtown Phoenix, I think this is a great location and the customer service very good. If you don't have to stay in Phoenix, I think I would skip the downtown altogether."}
{"text":"We love this place! I am here 2-3 times a month for work and every employee there is so welcoming. From walking in the front door passed all the bellman to Christine (my favorite bartender!) having my after travel cocktail prepared. Great location too"}
