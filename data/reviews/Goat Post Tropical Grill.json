{"text":"Return visit. Sad to say at around 7 pm the place is empty. I really feel for the owners of this place and i hope this was simply a slow weeknight.   We ordered the curry goat and whole fish - red snapper. started with codfish fritters ( big surprise - another restaurant.com coupon )   they bring you a basket of chips with bean dip ( sorry babe, you are gonna hate me later tonite ! )   As with my past visits, the food is good, it's home-cookin' good. Without the coupon, the pricing might be a little high ( the goat $16, the fish $23 ) but it comes with some great plantains, cabbage, and other veggies so it's a complete meal.   The place might also have an identity crisis - is it Jamaican ? Nicaraguan ? Mexican ? American ? The menu is very large.   I still like the place and hopefully it makes it !  pics attached"}
{"text":"Our only lunch on this trip was at the Goat Post Tropical Grill on Buffalo Drive.  This is a small unassuming restaurant owned by a couple that serve as waiter (him) and chef (her).  The food spans both the Caribbean and Mexico, but we went with for the Jamaican beef patties, jerk chicken with spicy fries and Jamaican ginger beer soda.  The pastry shell for the patties was amazingly soft and the filling provided enough spice to keep them interesting.  The jerk chicken proved to be spicy, tender and bountiful."}
{"text":"This is no longer a Caribean joint, it served Mexican and El Salvadoran.  I did not eat there, we wanted Jamaican Patties."}
