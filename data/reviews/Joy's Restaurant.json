{"text":"Thank goodness that they delivered. It took a while and the food was cold. I was so diappointed that crispy pata. lechon kawali wasn't on the take out menu. I hope they don't forget the utensils and condiments next time. Other then that..... the food was ok. Adobo could have a little more pork fat and less bay leaves and chunks of garlic in it."}
{"text":"Joy's restaurant can be a hit or miss little Filipino buffet at the downtown old strip. Their food r quite tasty n at times fresh. But unfortunately they do recycled old food n either reheat or cook them to a point of begin unedible or hard to chew. But their saving grace is the cheap buffet price of $7.99 n the only Filipino buffet which serve Lechon (ROAST PORK BELLY)."}
{"text":"This place has very authentic Filipino food. So good! Really good! Too good!!!"}
{"text":"Was there one time! In the add in a newspaper they said they have lechon kawali in their buffet, but they don't. Its just a trick for u to come! The tables are kind of oily. They didn't use anything to really clean it. Flies are everywhere. Food are fine. Not going back though.. Had tummy problem after I ate here."}
{"text":"Price for this location is $7.50 not bad for a Filipino Buffet the taste of the food is EHH-OKAY! it would have been better if the food is a warm since the food that they are serving is COLD!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch yesterday to see what the buzz was about.  Let me start by saying the food was delicious.  Food temperature was just right. Small family owned restaurant gives you that relax feeling. They also do catering for parties.  I'll definitely bring my out of town friends here."}
{"text":"The best Filipino Buffet in Vegas!  We always bring our out of town guests to Joy's and all of them have nothing but compliments on how good the food is. One went to 4 buffets on the strip and said Joy's is the best.  Another is a caterer from California and said she has to admit that Joy's food is really good. Keep up the good work and the very reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Joy's is our go to for Filipino food when we're here in LV. I love the authentic taste and the affordable price. The buffet line allows you to try different dishes and come back for more...no regrets! It is a small place, but it's a Pinoy sit down and eat and move on type of place. You come here for food, and great food you get!"}
{"text":"I think this place is the best Filipino buffet in Las Vegas . I never had a bad dish n the selection of pinoy foods is abundant. It's a small but clean place. The bilo bilo is fantastic, perfect dessert to end your meal. And yes she has a la carte items, topsilog, goto, mami, siopao, sigsig sigsig,  kalderta. and take out 3 items with either rice or pancit: 5.99. This place is a must for any pinoy/pinay to try while in vegas. Eggs are made to order with buffet"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and the excellent service , thank u Felix and chong
I always appreciate everything and the fact that u deliver"}
{"text":"My brother suggested for us to eat here for lunch. There's not much food to choose from and no desert at all. As we are eating, we realized they don't accept credit/debit cards... the price online was deceiving which they corrected after it was pointed out to them. Not planning to repeat the dining experience nor recommend to others at this time."}
{"text":"This Filipino buffet is so delicious. The staff is friendly, they also have a TV with Filipino channels. You feel like your eating with family. When I say it's all you can eat that's exactly what I mean. You pay at the end and it's such a reasonable price. The aunt's mom's and Grandma are doing all the cooking. I was very pleased with everything."}
{"text":"The food looked good...if only they would have served me. I wasn't even acknowledged AT ALL.

Walked in on a Sunday night. The lady behind the counter was already helping someone else so I waited until she was done, then she walked back into the kitchen. Two other fellas came in and someone else in the dining room told the lady she had customers. She proceeded to help them and ignored me, despite the fact that I had already been patiently waiting there. They wanted the last of the sisig, which was what I wanted. I asked her if they had anymore sisig left and she didnt even respond. Walked out with a bad taste in my mouth and a lost appetite."}
{"text":"I wish I could recommend, but I didn't get a chance to try the food.  I drove out there and they were closed. We're talking 7:30pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is really good. We always eat here everytime we are here in Vegas. Small place, but the quality of food is like home cooked Filipino food....not like other fastfood restaurant here."}
{"text":"Great Filipino food & awesome service. Lechon is always on point. Chicken skin chicharon is great. Pusit dinuguan is one of my favorites & they do it just right! Authentic Filipino food! Did I mention, it's all-you-can-eat?!?!"}
{"text":"This place is far from any five star fine dining restaurant. There are no waiters who come and take your orders and ask what wine you'd like to order. Far from it, but what I most love about Joy's restaurant is its stellar customer service. It feel exactly like a \"Kakainin\" place in the Philippines. When you enter Joy's the first thing they say to you is: \"Hello! Come in, take a seat and eat.\" It's a buffet place so instead of asking you to pay first, they ENCOURAGE YOU TO GRAB YOUR FOOD AND EAT FIRST. You pay later when you're done eating and full. It feels like I came home from college to eat home made Filipino food at my Lola's (Grandma's) house. No fuss. Just come in and eat.
The owner herself, Joy, whom we call \"Ate Vangie\" (Big sister Vangie), is always there to welcome and greet patrons first.  She's there talking to you casually about anything and everything under the sun. We also get to meet the cooks who greets us with smiles and who always ask if we've eaten already and if we're full. The food they have are classic Filipino comfort food and the flavors are all, no exaggeration, magnificent. Just like how Mom and Lola make it. 
Joy's restaurant is a hole in a wall but what a gem this place is. This is our go-to Filipino restaurant when we feel the need to energize. 
Two thumbs up for Joy's Restaurant and a definite recommendation from me to all of you. ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"On our stay in Las Vegas, we visited this place on the first full day that we were there. We found the buffet well stocked with the best of Filipino cuisine. Taste and quality are good but honestly, the buffet next door called Pinoy Resto Buffet was just a tad better in terms of quality and taste even if the restaurant itself doesn't compare to Joy's. We'll still go back here when we get the chance."}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken and it came to me ice cold. I called to complain and the guy pretty much called me a liar. I told him I have no reason to lie sir. He said it was made today so there is no way it can be cold. I told the guy either you make me new chicken and he called me back and said it would be an hour and the refund would be an hour as well. I told him never mind. I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I came here on a Sunday evening looking for authentic Filipino food.  They have rows of food to choose from and everything is self serve.  It's not the four seasons but if you want real Filipino food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We stopped by on our way out of Vegas after Life is Beautiful on Fremont St. It was an awesome sunny Monday morning and there were maybe 8 people inside including the staff.  As soon as we walked in we were given a warm welcome and encouraged to eat our fill before even thinking about paying.  This is not a high end boozy brunch spot or anything of the kind, it basically feels like walking into a family kitchen to get your nom on which is really all we wanted that morning.  The food quality was awesome, they had every single filipino comfort food I wanted without the 6 hour drive home first.  They have the standard sinigang, calderata, arroz caldo and pancit as well as a few other dishes that I haven't tried before.  The price is unbeatable at less than $10 per person.  They are cash only but totally worth the trip to the ATM."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed when I was half way through my meal when a roach was crawling on the table and under my plate. I acknowledged this to an older gentleman who was managing the restaurant and he took the napkin and squeezed the roach and scrubbed the remains off the table gently. I said politely that I was done, he did however offer me to grab another plate for seconds. I declined."}
{"text":"Came on  a Thursday around noon. Great for the price. Clean and friendly. A lot of my favorite Filipino dishes. However all the cuts of meat seemed very fatty. Not unusual for Filipino food but just seemed overly so on this day. The kare kare was also pork hock instead of beef. Still tasty but was never a huge fan of pork kare kare. The lechon was the deep fried kind. Again tasty but greasy. Overall the food was good not spectacular. But for the price it was well worth it."}
{"text":"A family friend took me here and I was not impressed. This is a small, probably family-run Filipino establishment. Although you can see that the staff sincerely cares about the customers and the food, cleanliness can be improved. The tables aren't the cleanest. The buffet table doesn't seem that clean either. There aren't labels for the food; as a person with food allergies, it's a problem. The 7am crowd is made up of Filipino cab drivers getting ready for their morning shift. There is plenty of just-add-water coffee for each person to make for them self. If I wasn't with a regular at the restaurant that personally knows the staff, I don't think my experience would have been as enjoyable. Overall, I don't think I will be returning to this establishment. If they work on cleanliness and labeling the food, I'd consider returning. Even though I didn't thoroughly enjoy my first experience here, I'm still rooting for this hole-in-the-wall restaurant because of the caring and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Getting in touch with my Filipino roots and discovered this place close to downtown. It's all you can eat buffet for $7.99 cafeteria style. Sinigang and white rice to cure my allergies did the trick. Dilis, were these fried mini fish chips to snack on. Tuyo were these fried alittle bit bigger fried fish to snack on which was just as tasty as the Delis. This man came in the restaurant and I didn't understand a word he said but he just sat down and seemed hungry. The lady who worked there provided him food to go which was nice of her. There also was this lady with a child on her back that came in to ask the guests to buy what she was selling. Around noon time there were alot of old folks that came in to brunch. This place is pretty small but the green walls make it seem bigger inside."}
{"text":"I ordered again this time even more better then the last time. I would like to apologize I didn't have a tip as this was a last minute thought to order , no change on me, but next time I will surly have  tip money."}
{"text":"I am glad that they had dinuguan and lechon during my visit, those are two of my favorite dishes!

Lots of items available in the buffet at a reasonable price (less than $10). The restaurant is not that big but there are a number of seats/tables. It was a little warm inside but they had fans blowing. 

The quality of the food is okay, I think it's quantity/variety over quality here. I've had better AYCE Filipino buffet food in California, but it also cost more there.

I also ordered halo halo for dessert, which came in a huge bowl but was not that good (did not have evaporated milk, fruit, or the little crunchy cereal things, just some ice cream and jellies)."}
{"text":"We visiting from Los angeles and stumbled this philipino rest from yelp. Turns out to be SO delicious! And so cheap too $6.99 buffet and really good filipino food.  The lechon is so soft crunchy yummy.  The salmon soup so delicious and fresh.  Thank you way to go. The people are very nice as well"}
{"text":"Hey! Who's that lady na nag post about sa kine claim nyang change. She's very stupid. Saan ka nkakita na the day after bago nya naalala na may sukli pala sya, lol, nkakatawa ano. Kaya d dapat paniwalaan.  Wag syang manira dahil sya ang sira."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. .. they keep the food trays fresh and full. The Filipino style food cooking is very good here - A+ to the cook. The place is kept orderly and clesn. They serve all foods from 6am to midnight - I recommend and will be back when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Masarap!

I never heard about Joy's Filipino Restaurant & Buffet until another place near my work (Manila's Best) closed, which left me looking for another place nearby.  Glad we found her!

Located close to Charleston and Maryland, in what some would call an 'unsavory' part of town, Joy's is down home Filipino cooking you would find in your Nanay or Tatay's house.  Dang authentic!  If you like pork, and you like things in soup, and if you like bowls of white rice, you won't have any issue's at Joy's!  Sure you could order items ala carte, but make it easy and just go for the buffet!  Eat all of it!

We wandered into Joy's around the start of lunch.  Joy's is open for long hours, like 6:00 AM to almost midnight from what I've read depending on the day.  So since we got there in the brunching hour, some breakfast items were available with lunch!  I got to feast on some morning goodies - basically my favorite Filipino breakfast of hot rice, sweet longanisa, and scrambled eggs with tomato & onion!  So yummy!

But I didn't forget to have some lunch too!  More hot rice, with pancit, tarong (eggplant), lechon kawali, and a bowl of chicken papaya soup!  There were so many other things available that day like kare kare, guisadong pusit (sautéed squid), dinuguan (pork with pork blood, aka 'chocolate meat'), fried chicken, sinigang and much more!  I was just too full to try everything.

But quality of the food was there, fresh tasting, and close to what I'm used to eating when I was a kid.  Foods were kept hot, most things weren't sitting too long (some of the breakfast items were because they weren't going to be refilled since it was lunch), and the buffet line was kept very clean.  

OK, food is good but don't judge it based on environment.  Joy's buffet looks DATED.  Like the way my grandpa & grandpa decorated their house back in the 80's.  A similar green paint was used on their walls too!  It does look a bit unkempt and rickety when you look around the restaurant.  And...the bathroom is no real joy either.  Then again, the restaurant is housed in a strip mall that seems old anyway.  But it does vaguely resemble pics of my relatives houses back in the Philippines!  Don't focus on this and just go for the food.  Eat and be merry!

Food was well priced to boot.  All-you-can-eat buffet was only $6.99 per person!  Cheapie!  But I can't remember if it's cash only or if you can use a credit/debit card.

Oh, one more tip.  If you're rich and look rich, drive a luxury car, and resemble anything of a hipster...do not wander into this area where Joy's is too late into the night!  Dress down please!  No need to gather yourself unwanted attention because the lighting around there is very suspect.  I'm not gonna judge the homeless that hang around there (the one I offered food to was gracious), but just be aware of your surroundings.  Late night robberies can't be fun!

AGAIN...masarap!"}
{"text":"Delivery took a little while but we are happy that they offer delivery. Food prices are affordable and good. My baby loves sinigang and she ate a lot. 
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stay away!!! Horrible and dirty. Bad service. There are numerous filipino restaurants within 2 miles...go there. DO NOT GO TO JOYS."}
{"text":"This place is fucking disgusting. Zero stars for me. Food was just GROSS. I can't believe how people would rate this place so much and write good reviews. Owner was a bitch too saying this is all they have. WHAT THE FUCK ? This is your restaurant YOU are obligated to make the food look good.
Never going here again."}
{"text":"Everything is flavorful and very reasonable .
You cannot get wrong for $6.99 buffet for all day 
We will be back..."}
{"text":"They always serve cold food. Their food warmer is no good. Who wants to eat cold filipino food? No one."}
{"text":"Not happy with what we ordered.. Ordered the lechon and it was skinny and dry... We wasted money.."}
{"text":"This place is a bittersweet restaurant that I like but don't like. You get what you pay for and the food isn't as sanitary as you'd expect from a restaurant. But their food is very delicious so you're kind of stuck in the middle to where your health matters or the satisfaction of the food does. For the past two visits I've chosen the satisfaction of the food and instantly regret it. My stomach would be sore after the first visit and during the second visit I've seen so many flies chillin on the adobo, pancit, and rice, and seen customers just scoop food from that area without the employee's coming to stop them or change out the food. I like the Filipino buffet concept but I wish they were more sanitary and aware of bugs landing on the food or even crawling on the tables."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty, it's a little further than the usual place I go to, but definitely worth the drive. The service is friendly. They had all my favorite foods, even fried chicken skin and lumpia! Yummy! Even dessert was so good"}
{"text":"We stumble onto this place several years back and we glad that we did. If you like Filipino food and buffets this is the place for you. For a small place the owners serves up a wide variety of dishes and surprisingly tasty. The price was really more than reasonable. We have and continued to make sure that this is one stop in Vegas that never miss."}
{"text":"I walked in to this Restaurant/Buffet with my dad. It was one of the strangest customer experiences I've ever had. It wasn't bad but it was definitely strange.

When we walked in we were greeted by a family sitting down at a table. They were all eating and we thought they were customers. But then they told us that we pay after we finish eating and that the plates and food were against the wall. They were nice but not very professional. We didn't see a fountain machine so we asked if there were any drinks and they pointed to a fridge and told us to take what we wanted. We didn't have any ice or cups so they brought us out cups, ice (in a bowl) and bendy straws and then sat down to finish eating. Once we finished a lady got up from the table and walked to the register so we could pay. It was very inexpensive and we were trouble bringing out change so she just took the $20 bill we gave her even the the bill was $22 dollars. It was nice but weird and a bit unprofessional but not in a bad way.

The food itself was was good. They didn't have any signs up for what the food was so I didn't know what I was eating. But I had some rice with some sort of meat and veggies. It tasted good but not spectacular. They had soups and meats and rice and not much else. The food selection was very scarce. It was literally one bar with different foods. I did go up for a second helping because it did taste good but I didn't know what I was eating. My father and his friend didn't much enjoy the food but they don't like Asian food much anyways.

Overall, i would have to say it was a strange experience. I don't know if I would come back (a little to laid back for my liking) but if you don't mind the good but unprofessional guest service I would recommend it. It was inexpensive and was alright."}
{"text":"foods are really great, environment are neat and organize. server are very friendly and approachable. the nilaga is the best for me! i will come back here for sure!"}
