{"text":"The pizza was good except for the canned mushrooms. I can't stand canned mushrooms on my pizza. Did I say I can't stand canned mushrooms on my pizza. I didn't think anybody used canned mushrooms any more. I don't think it's fresh crust either even though it wasn't bad. Plenty of other pizza places around"}
{"text":"I pre-ordered 3 pizzas for a specific date / time and they were RIGHT on the money and ready to go when I came to pick them up.  2 of the pizzas were delicious,  heaped with toppings, really good!  The taco pizza was a bit strange,  it has nacho cheese sauce on it,  and it was a bit much for  our group.     I will definitely order again! in the future,  I'm a local and it beats the pants off of Pizza Hut. !!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza around. I love the small town feel. As a local you are sure to recognize more than a few diners or staff members when you pick your order up. Everyone who works there is extremely helpful and you are always in and out quickly.   The pizza is one of a kind and with their unique ranch dressing it is absolutely the best! No room for improvement needed."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant that has terrific pizza and good craft beers. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. Great local establishment."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty consistently. Always great service and love the open space. One con is the bathrooms. Please visit Spartan Pizza soon."}
{"text":"Spartan Pizza is going smoke-free on March 1, 2010, well ahead of the ban.  Way to go, Spartan!!!"}
{"text":"The Spartan Deluxe is our favorite! If you want delicious pizza with really fresh toppings, this is the place to go.  We always get the thin crust because they don't skimp on the toppings, yum!"}
{"text":"Sweet Jay-sus! Sitting here on a conference call, appetizing on the fried mushroom appetizers and - oh my - by far and away, the best fried mushrooms I have had - and I've had a ton...  The fries were spectacular too... Just waiting to dig into the Mexican pizza and watch some Downton Abbey... Gonna make a B-Day feast dyn-o-mite!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite pizza place.  The spartan deluxe is tasty.  LOADED with toppings.  Crispy thin crust.  Never can complain.  Been a customer over 20 plus years."}
{"text":"Good pizza (not like Pizza Hut, more like home-made) with a great bar with nice, friendly service."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza.  Here's why: - the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top - the sauce is sweet and savory - the cheese is rich and delicious - the veggies were fresh and tasty  We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.  We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.  The service was casual and friendly.  In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.  I should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  This is a \"no frills\" kind of place."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago. Very friendly staff although a but inattentive at times. The pizza was delicious, very good crust and not too greasy. The waitress suggested the cheese bread and it was pretty good as well. The rest of the menu is pretty much deep fried bar food you'd find anywhere but I will definitely be back for the pizza and a couple beers!"}
{"text":"Do you like it when your bowels want to explode?  Then this is the place for you.  The sad thing is, the aroma coming from the restaurant is hypnotizing as it drifts through the neighborhood, and the staff is really nice, but holy jeebus, does the pizza suck.  Every time we went there we spent the rest of the night in the bathroom.  Awful."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I would rather have frozen pizza.  It was really bad."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Service was very good and atmosphere was great.  My favorite place for pizza in McFarland.  There was no waiting for a table and the staff was very friendly and eager to help."}
{"text":"This place has Great Pizza! I got the Spartan Deluxe! Amazing"}
