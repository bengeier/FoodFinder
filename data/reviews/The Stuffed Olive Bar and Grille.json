{"text":"Stopped into The Stuffed Olive on a Tuesday night about 7p.  There were very few people In the restaurant portion and several tables busy in the bar. We grabbed a seat at the bar as we were hoping to grab a quick bite. That was a mistake. We waited over 30 minutes for a meatball sub and a sandwich. The salad was not anything super special nor the sandwich. We were however entertained by \"the crazy lady\" who, best as I could tell, had a party and invited the bartenders and somehow made a fool of herself. She was pretty loudly apologetic every minute or so hoping to be appeased. Of course while the bartenders were sitting and talking, we weren't being served. The place emptied out and we ate a very late dinner with \"the crazy lady\" and bartenders.   Don't think I'd go back. Mediocre food, terrible service."}
{"text":"I need to give you the details so you do not think this is just a \"It sucks\" kind of review. You need to know the facts.I apologize for the lengthiness.  25 minutes after ordering a salad and 4 meals, I notice that a table that came in 20 minutes after us is getting their nachos. Full on nachos. We still hadn't gotten our salad. When I asked the waitress about the status of our salad, she said she would check. She then went to the POS computer and obviously placed the salad order. Never once went to the window (which I was seated less than 4 feet from) to \"inquire\" about the salad. When she finally brought the salad about 2 minutes later, she said \"Im sorry, the kitchen is backed up.\" 4 tables in the restaurant with patrons, but the kitchen is backed up? I understand how hard it can be to make a salad, versus making an entire plate nachos. Makes sense. About 45 seconds after finally getting the salad that the 3 of us were to share, hostess (remember her for later. She is a critical player in this fiasco) shows up with a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and inquires as to who gets this meal. I tell her that we did not order that. She says, \"oh, then why is it on the ticket?\"  I replied, \"How would I know??\" She comes back with my wife's meal, mine and my 11 year old's meal and leaves. There is No room on the table with all the meals and the salad, that should have been long ago eaten and not taking up critical real estate for the pizzas. Also, no kid meal yet, so when the waitress comes by and asks, \"everything ok here?\" I look at her and say, \"No. Not at all. Where is the kid pizza?\" She looks bewildered and says, let me see. Again, disappears to the machine, comes back (clearly she JUST placed the kid meal order) and says, \" They messed up and sent out the spaghetti and meatballs I guess. I just put it in again. Itll be about 5-8 miutes.\" Nothing like a 2 year old without food.  About 1 minute later,  hostess shows up again. This time, as clueless as ever, she says, \"So, there was a problem with the spaghetti and meatballs?\"  My brain is folding in on itself because it cannot fathom the level of stupidity it is  listening to. I replied that WE DIDN'T ORDER ANY SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS! \"Ok,so what did you want?\" I replied that we had ordered a kids pizza. She said she would make sure it was ordered, AND she said that she would make sure she didn't charge us for the kid pizza since it was going to be late. I then replied that \"You wont' be charging me for the salad either because it came out way too late and now we have too much on the table to even handle it all.\" She looked at me and said, \"Um, I don't know about that. I'll have to see.\" and then left. She goes into the kitchen and I can absolutely hear the conversation between her and whoever (chef? manager?) in the back about how \"I dunno, he told me he wasn't paying for the salad or the pizza. He didn't want the spaghetti and meatballs.\"  (OMG!!Again with the spaghetti and freaking meatalls?) I then hear mystery guy from the back say, \"It's a side salad. What's the problem?\"  Last pizza for the little 2 year old finally comes, we eat (angry eating is never fun and at this point, we just want to get out of here, which sucks as well. Knowing you're spending good money on a horrible experience just plain sucks.) and when Dingbat Von Dingbat (hostess) brings our check she really shows me just how \"special\" of a person she must be.  \"Sir, I just wanted to let you know what I did here.\" ( Ok, maybe she's gonna really impress me here. There's still hope, right?)  \"I couldn't take off the salad, because I can't refund you for something you ate. I'm not sure if there was some misunderstanding about the coming out part.\"  Hand to God, that's what she said! \"Okaaaaay?\" I replied....\"I DID take off the spaghetti and meatballs though and wanted to let you know that. So you aren't being charged for that.\"  As I put my head in my hands in exasperation, I said, \" But I didn't order that, so it shouldn't even be a bullet point of yours!\" \"I know, that's why we didn't charge you.\" (can anyone else feel the tension building yet?) \"Okaaaayyyyy?\" I hesitantly stated, waiting for the awesomeness that she clearly was saving for last. I mean, surely she had to do something to fix this trip we have taken into the Twilight Zone of dinners, right??  She stared at me for a second or 2, clearly she had nothing more to add. I asked, \"And what about the kid Pizza?\"  \"Yeah, that's on there.\" She said as plain as day. (wow) \"So let's recap\", I said, \"You're charging me for the salad that came 25 minutes after ordering, you're charging me for the pizza that came 8 minutes AFTER everyone else, AND you're NOT charging me for the meal that I NEVER ORDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND YOU'RE  MAKING IT OUT LIKE YOU ARE DOING ME A FAVOR??\"  Blank stare...\"Is there anything else I can do for you sir?\"  Folks, steer clear of this place. Seriously. BTW, this wonderful experience cost $50. Imagine..."}
{"text":"Good food...not fantastic but the odds are you won't leave disappointed.  Wings are excellent and the Patty Malt is a solid choice.  Good beer selection.  This is a cut above your typical bar food joint.  My only complaint is the house music.  You go from great songs to bad 70's songs.  The live music is generally pretty good.  I suggest you give it a try!!"}
{"text":"If there was a minus 10 rating, that is what I would give this place!!  Friday night, walk in at  6:30ish and hostess tells us it will be at LEAST an hour wait!!  Do we want to wait?? Yes, we say, sign us up!!!  5 min. later have a table---all is looking good!!!   Hostess was very frazzled, but you could tell by looking around it would not have been an hour wait, which is why we agreed to the extremely off wait time--- anyway!!!  Order a pizza (extra thin/extra crispy) and two sandwiches!!  Told pizzas are coming out within 20 min. but sandwiches will be at LEAST an hour--if not more!!!  WHAT!!!  Waitress actually tries to discourage us from ordering!!!  Why in the world is this place open!!!!   From hostess to waitstaff--encouraged to \"not order\"   OK,--- still---we order the pizza and 2 sandwiches!!!  True to her word---we wait the full hour---but watch as bar and tables empty out within 20 minutes, but still we wait!!!  Bar is filthy, tables are dirty, staff is frazzled, but not sure why!!!!  Did nobody alert this place that they are a serving restaurant!!! We have actually been a true blue customer for two years--- service has always been a bit off and on, but since it is a local neighborhood spot we have stayed true!!   As of tonight---WE ARE DONE!!!!"}
{"text":"I will say that the food was good but that is all I can say good about this place.   We have been there a few times and each time the service was poor. This visit started out by ordering Fried Pickles, they were out so we skipped the appetizers ....This visit there were two other groups of customers, one table had three people, the other had eight...The group of eight got their food ate it, paid for it and left, we still had no food. The waitress never came over to check on us.  After 30 minutes waiting for our Sub and Hamburger, the waitress walked past us, I told her we were getting ready to leave.. She did at this point say she was sorry for the long and said the food is coming right up.  Again, the food is good but not worth the wait, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  The food was mediocre, fried pickles were amazing. But my boyfriend and I nearly lost our appetites due to how awful we were treated.... The hostess got us our waters and appetizer and she was very friendly. About 10 minutes later our waitress comes out and asks If we're \"just going to eat appetizers or if we would actually like to hear the dinner specials\".....   After hearing the specials she says she will give us a minute and walks away. We decided on the gyro and the grilled chicken sandwich. However the waitress never came back. So we saw the hostess and said were ready to order, she had to go find our waitress for us. The girl finally comes out and takes our order. At this point both our waters are empty and we have almost finished the giant appetizer. Ten minutes later we finally see the waitress again and my boyfriend asks if we could get more water. So she takes his glass and leaves. Never got the water! We had to ask again and she apologized and brought one glass of water. (Both of our glasses were empty).... So we decide we wanted to try their Martinis, once again couldn't find the waitress...this has been a good 40 minutes of being there, still no food, no water, and no waitress to order their \"specialty\" Martinis..   To wrap it up, we had to rudely interrupt her while she was chatting it up with whom I'm assuming were regular customers and ask her for our check. When she brings the check she disappears again.. Another ten minutes pass and my boyfriend takes the card and check inside where he sees her dusting wine glasses, she tells him to wait there and she will have it in a minute. Needless to say I will never be going back and I will warn you we were not the only ones being treated like this. The table of 5 behind us had to wave her down to get another round of drinks (they had also been there a long time and hadnt even received their food) Unfortunately, I do not recommend going here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times and tried to give them a fair shot. It's not well managed (untrained waitstaff and hosts etc.) and I haven't been impressed with the service. The menu is standard pub fare, nothing new - overcooked burgers etc. They recently added brick oven pizza to their menu, and the two I've tried have borderd on no taste whatsoever. And these pizzas are really expensive for what you get. I'm no fan of chain restaurants, but Brixx pizzas are much better than this.  Not sure how these unimaginative pub-themed restaurants with carbon copy menus continue to stay in business when the food and service are so unexceptional. I'm guessing it's the alcohol selection! I realize different folks have different tastes, but with as many burger, sandwich, and pizza joints as we have around, you'd think customers would demand a competitve atmosphere and not accept the standard below average fare."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was just ok. Sat outside on a beautiful Friday night, very nice atmosphere with the piano singer for entertainment (aside from the parking lot noise). Very reasonable prices! Good variety of bar food and Italian delights, I can't wait to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"They provide good food and music! Service isn't bad either!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the pizza was pretty good. The servers were super nice but for as small as the restaurant is the service was terribly slow. We were there on a Sat. night and got a table pretty much right away, but after and hour and a half with no pizza we had to take dinner to go since we had a toddler with us. Not sure we will try it again."}
{"text":"We heard great thing about TSO, so went all the way to Waxhaw today at lunch to try it out. We saw two young ladies get up from a booth and ask for service when we walked in the door, and they were treated extremely rudely by the hostess. They left without ordering.  We weren't sure what had happened, but the hostess promptly sat us and took our drink order and brought us drinks right away.  We sat back and took in our surroundings (great decor!) and watched the same very harried hostess/waitress/bartender try to run the place by herself.  I'm guessing there was a cook in the kitchen?  After 20 minutes of waiting for her to take our order, our hunger got the best of us, so we asked for the tab for our drinks and said waitress literally threw both hands up in the air and slammed them back down on the counter.  Then she mumbled, \"Don't even worry about it.\"  We then went to Stacks where the service was fast and friendly.  This waitress/hostess/bartender was obviously very frazzled for having to do everyone's job by herself.  Maybe you need to hire enough people to make the place run smoothly?  And maybe Miss hot-temper shouldn't be  left with so much responsibility.  I give TSO 0 stars."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more after seeing some good reviews on here. The food is ok. The wings I got were ok. Nothing to write home about. My fiance got the pizza and she said it was alright. My brother got the chicken pita sandwich, and he said it was alright. My friend got another sandwich there and said it was ok. The food was pretty average, nothing that really set this place apart.  Something that did set this place apart was the service. It was pretty terrible, both times I've gone here. First visit was around 5pm on a weekend. Our waitress was nice and polite but she never came by to offer refills etc. She left us our checks and literally we sat at the table for 15 minutes (obviously ready to leave) before she came back to take our payments.  The second time I went to the Olive was on a week night around 7pm. I went for a few drinks while a couple of my friends got dinner. They do have a very good beer selection. Several craft beers on draft. We got our drinks fast and the two eating put in orders for sandwiches and fries. I am not exaggerating at all when I say this: we waited over an hour for two sandwiches and fries. Our waitress was very polite. She kept apologizing for the wait saying it will only be a few more minutes (probably 3 times over a period of 30 minutes lol.) We ended up getting our drinks comp'd because of the wait. Even so, the people who waited for the food said it was good, but not an hours wait  good, and definitely didn't taste like a $10 sandwich.  The two times I've been there have been more of a hassle than anything.  Maybe the bar is better, but I won't be going back for a meal."}
{"text":"Very personal service and a great local addition in Waxhaw!  Good food, cold drinks and fun atmosphere.  Chicken Caprese sandwich was top notch.  Terrific draft beer selection, too!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!  We made a confirmed reservation days before Mother's Day and they called us in the afternoon of Mother's Day to tell us \"they decided to close early\" and could not seat us. No offer to make it right, nothing. Please don't visit this restaurant. No way to make a new reservation anywhere at this point. Ruined Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Recently added breakfast to their menu...items advestise on menu, they were out of it, offer no substitute. Food arrive undercooked, over cooked ,tasteless and cold. Bad service ...45 minute wait for food to arrive."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and if it was not for that, the review would be worst, it would 1 star. Their servers are terrible, they need to train their staff. The service was good for a short time and now it has gotten worst. Obviously, I have been here before. The server Sophie does not have a clue about how to serve people, it is all about her, not about the guest having a good experience. I hope something can be done and I would gladly alter this review. They could have a nice place here but sadly it can be hugely disappointing as well."}
{"text":"I've read many reviews about poor service but that wasn't our experience. I guess it depends on who you get. Our waitress was terrific. I had the wings-teriyaki and mango habanero (I think). The wings are by far the best I've had in a long time. Very good size, crisp and great flavors. The blue cheese dressing that I had with the wings and a side salad was delicious with big chunks of blue cheese. Definitely homemade. We had a very nice experience."}
{"text":"I will start out that the waitress was nice.  Ok, now for the food review. We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and they came out still frozen in the center. So we sent them back and they just dropped the ones we already had back in the fryer. I had spit out a chewed up piece onto the plate, because it was frozen, and that chewed up, spit out piece made it back with all of the other pieces. Then the chicken parm and spaghetti and meatball came out. They were not good, the chicken was chewy and the breading was mushy. The meatball had a bad after taste. They also don't offer any other type of noodle other than spaghetti. It's more of a bar that try's to serve Italian. We will not return."}
{"text":"Really good place, a gem. We've been here a little more than a year and just discovered it tonight.    Pizza sticks, eggplant parm and lobster ravioli were amazing.  The place stocks Heineken Lights, not a lot places around here do.  Wifey enjoyed Blue Moon on draft and didn't have to ask for an orange. The garlic bread and Chocolate Molten Lava cake were five star!    We'll certainly be visiting again and getting take-out.  Did I mention the service?  Impeccable, the restaurant is run by husband and wife."}
{"text":"First, the positives. My friend and I each had a pizza. The crust was delicious and as far as I'm concerned,  anything tastes good with goat cheese on it.  It was a lovely night, so we sat outdoors. They have a decent menu with some interesting items.  We got there around 6 pm on a Monday night and there were only about 6-8 people. Our pizza was taking a long time and our server said it was because they had to roast more eggplant for the pizza. Ok...so the pizza arrives and there is no detectable eggplant on either pizza. I questioned the server and she said that it was in the sauce and you couldn't see it. I called BS on that one. We were hungry after waiting about 35-40 minutes so we didn't push the issue."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a few friends & family to have a couple of beers last week.   The service was fast and friendly. We did not eat - so I can't comment about the food.  However, for a comfy little watering hole, this is a cool place to stop in."}
{"text":"All I can say is if are in a rush not the place to stop. Waited 10 minutes at the door before we were seated, 10 minutes before we ordered drinks and another 30 for food. Think it could be a great place if they just get there servers in check on how to wait on customers in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Ordered a milkshake that was supposed to come with bananas, whipped cream, and maraschino cherries.     Instead, I was told there was no bananas or whipped cream and the cherries I received were normal cherries with pits.    The meal took a very long time to arrive and we waited quite a while, but the Ultimate Bar Burger was very good.     Waitress was unfriendly at best."}
{"text":"The husband and I are never disappointed with the food....there are times we actually crave the fried pickles because they are not greedy like other places, their Mantini is wonderful.   Service there however can be hit or miss. There are two bartenders there that are superb one from NJ and the other I believe has been there since the place opened , we have learned to go on specific days to avoid agrivation of being left there for 20 mins after we have already put our menus down, or being inside when it is completely dead enough to hear the poor servers complain about their jobs, but we still love the place"}
{"text":"I just tried the stuffed olive despite the low rating.  I liked the bar area which was simple but cute.   The staff was not very attentive which is a major turnoff.      The mussels were tasty but I think that was more to do with the overwhelming spices that were used.   I was still hungry but was unwilling to try any other items on the menu.    All in all, great name for a restaurant, cute bar and cheap drafts.  That's really all this place has to offer.   If I were the owner, I would take a look at my hiring practices, my menu and keep my eye on the business"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Other reviews about staff are likely warranted.  Though I had no real negative experience with the staff, the overall demeanor was not what most people expect from an Italian restaurant.  Our server was nice and did a good job.  But they weren't restaurant ready, in my opinion.  Prices were too high for what they are, which is a pizza place with a bar, that tries to act like an Italian restaurant. I had the lasagna, which looked AWESOME!  It didn't live up to the hype.  The sauce had too much tomato taste.  I know, it's tomato sauce.  But still, theirs was too much.  It had many layers, but most were just pasta layers to add bulk, not filled with anything.  I probably won't go back as there are better Italian restaurants around, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Homemade chips!  That is all you need to know! Nice little spot, good food & good service."}
{"text":"So the meals have improved considerably and the wait staff the past half dozen or so visits has been pleasant to exceptional. Have to give props when due. It looks like Olive is really trying to get it together. And it's about time. There's some pretty good competition in the area.    Recommend watching the traffic and reviews, and plan for a makeover in the not too distant future. Smoke free outside would be advisable. Better beer and wine selections. Mixing up the entertainment would be nice to."}
{"text":"Given the rave reviews and high star rating we were both very disappointed.  We also live in Sun City, but still have our taste buds, so that might account for most of those ratings.  Yes, the beer selections were super.  Lots of drafts.  4 stars  Menu was, as another 2 star rater mentioned...just sandwiches, burgers and pizza.  Also we asked as to the soup of the day and were informed that they no longer do soup because no one orders it.  Otherwise, the menu was as described.  3 stars  Ambiance was nice.  Well done, fancy for a beer bar with separate eating area from the bar that did have only tall tables in the bar area.  4 stars  It was around 5:45 so was not crowded, esp for a Friday night, but the service was slow.  I ordered a beer, wife a wine and water.  Got the beer and had to ask twice for the wine and another time on top of that for the water.  Waitress was nice, frank and friendly. 3 stars.  The food was the killer a low 2 stars.  Ordered the battered pickle appetizer which was great, especially the buffalo ranch for dipping.  Very yum  and a huge portion.  4 stars.  Authentic brick oven pizza is their advertized forte.  Lots of selections, no other options.  Ordered the Margarita.  It was burned on the outside crust and all along the bottom.  Like NY as some rater commented?  NO WAY!  Yes, brick oven pizza is done at very high heat over a very short period of cooking.  This was burned.  OH!  and it was hyped as olive oil brushed...if you say so.  And $13 for a 12 inch pizza with 8 slices of tomato and 6 small globs of cheese?  Out-of-bounds.  So burned pizza, \"It is brick oven baked said the waitress.\"  And the toppings were so minimal that there was no flavor to compete with the char.  Hard and flavorless.  1 star.   When I asked the waitress what was popular she gushed over the lasagna.  9 layers, etc.  It came.  Hefty portion.  At first I thought that it was meatless, but I did pull through the layers of noodles to find a few small bits of meat.  Mostly ricotta and only a slab of mozzarella on top.  Tomato sauce was basic, just about right out of the can...flavorless.  The lasagna was equally flavorless.  1 star  Wife ate three pieces of pizza, I ate one.  We took half home to show the neighbors.  Tried it again for lunch the next day, threw it out.  I ate about one fourth of the lasagna, took the rest home.  Wife ate half of the 75% we brought home the next day and threw out the rest...just about 50% of it tossed.  Does this sound like great food to you?  If you drink a lot of booze and lack taste buds and wouldn't know flavor if you tripped over it then this is YOUR kind of place.  Nice appearance without any real substance.  There were a lot of families with small children, so given the blah food, just right for little kids and exhausted parents that are not there for the food, just the convenience.  We won't be back.  Why repeat a bad experience?  You have been warned."}
{"text":"They have really good gluten free pizza. Love the smoked gouda chicken pizza. The live music on Friday nights is nice too."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because it's required to leave a review. What type of Italian restaurant doesn't serve pasta? Let me be clear, it's not that they don't serve pasta, they just don't serve ANY pasta for lunch. My mom and I picked this restaurant out of several other places we could've gone and Ballantyne because we were both wanting Eggplant Parmesan with a side of pasta, simple request, right?? Wrong, they wouldn't even serve the Eggplant Parmesan that was on the menu because the server said she \"wouldn't know how to charge for that\". We should've left and went to Stacks in the same strip mall but decided to stick with our craving and ordered the eggplant Parmesan pizza and a side salad. The pizza was not bad,the eggplant was decent but the salad had wilted lettuce and soggy croutons. The food left much to be desired but if that wasn't enough, the server was completely rude and unaccommodating. You can bet we will never be back here again."}
{"text":"AWFUL food we waited an hour and a half for. I have never started crying after leaving a restaurant. But on the last night I had to spend with my father while I was in town, we unfortunately headed here for dinner. Should've taken it as a gift when they gave away our table to another group that walked in behind us. So much confusion and waiting literally over an hour at the table only to get inedible potato chips, Alfredo that tasted like nothing, and over cooked mush tortellini. Thanks for the 10% off our bill, but that was still a $60 bill and we are all hungry and have stomach aches. No manager ever showed their face to our table to make things right, see if we were happy, or make amends. I was looking for one at the beginning of the night and never could pick one out. Also if you're charging 15$ a plate the servers shouldn't have sloppy looking untucked shirts on. This place needs a reality check. And we need a REFUND. Trattoria right down the street I'm sure they know what they're doing. This is my first Yelp review because this was literally the most disappointing food experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 5-star rating!  Omg!  The Stuffed Olive is \"off the chain!\"  Service was excellent and the food was outstanding! My partner and I ordered the fried pickles as our appetizer.  They had just enough spice and were not soggy (HUGE plus!)  These pickles are a MUST HAVE!  Moving on to the entrees, I had the Ultimate Bar Burger and he had the Philly Cheese.  The burger was cooked to my liking and had a fabulous juicyness to it.  The caramelized onions, bacon, and thousand island dressing had perfect flavor and not to mention the fried egg on top.  Sounds weird, I know, BUT you have to try it to believe that different is superior!  His Philly Cheese was really good, but was lacking in the abundance of meat.  It had just enough to fill him up though :). They had live music and a huge selection of draft beer.  They even will give you a sample of a beer if you're unsure of how they taste.  I could not have asked for better service from Makayla (not sure if I spelled your name right or not.)  She was on top of everything.  I serve as well, so it takes a lot to really impress me.  Kudos to you for making such a wonderful impression on me.  Please go by and see the people at The Stuffed Olive, they will be glad to take care of you and be sure that you dont leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Great local place to grab a bite and drinks. Food is good and good beer selections on draft."}
{"text":"Our friends suggested we have Lupper (lunch/supper) here.  Its was overall good.  The fare is generally italian serving pizza, lasagna,  spaghetti, sandwiches but also burgers.   I had the four cheese  pizza and one of the cheeses i think the gorganzola tasted a bit like goat cheese which i don't care for.  We also had the spaghetti with meatballs.  Again,  overall a good meal."}
{"text":"First time we have eaten here. Restaurant has outdoor seating, indoor, and a bar as well. Comfortable atmosphere, nice menu , and moderate prices.   Lots of Italian specialties to include, chicken, pastas,  some seafood, burgers and sandwiches,  pizza, salads, a kids menu. No soups, but a chili  We ordered 2 of the blackboard specials, a blackened salmon and cowboy steak. Our waitress was very accommodating.  The specials came with a garden salad, and potatoes  . I asked for a vegetable instead of potatoes, none today but was told they  normally have broccoli which I did not see on the menu The menu really has no vegetable sides but rather  mostly starch  foods, which  somewhat disappointed me .  The blackened fish was very good, moist and tender as well as my steak which was cooked perfectly to order? and  smothered with cheese, onions and some mushrooms. Food came out hot , good portions and plated nicely.  The side  salads were good, the potatoes were  ok, rosemary and oil  for my dining mate, but mine covered with a  spicy  peppery provolone cheese which  he said tasted ok.   I would definitely return an try something else from the menu"}
{"text":"The food and service was not good at all. The drinks were okay, but the prices were not. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We went here to grab a burger and beer with the intention of heading home to unwind, but ended up staying because the atmosphere was so great.  The bartender put both a football and baseball game on for us, and we were able to keep tabs on our teams while still enjoying live music and great conversation with other patrons.    This restaurant/bar is small, and I believe they become more of a \"bar\" after 10p.m. than a restaurant.  The food was excellent.   It's your typical pub fair, but classed up a bit.  They had some sort of sirloin special going on too, but seriously, how can I order a steak if you're offering a hamburger piled high with everything, including a fried egg with sweet potato fries on the side?  Perhaps most impressive about the Stuffed Olive is their craft beer selection.  They have Palm Ale on tap - very tasty!  We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't post poor reviews often. I tried to support local - again. We have made the joke when they are \"out\" of menu items that there is a supermarket In the parking lot and I have tried again to support this establishment.  Tonight they were out of two selections one was wings (the reason we went there). When the check was provided - our server proceeded to trash talk us within earshot because we weren't staying. Never again. NEVER again."}
{"text":"The food is just okay and the ambiance isn't that bad except if you are sitting outside and have the most spectacular view of the Food Lion and parking lot.  My waitress was bitter and actually cussed several times.  I now know why I haven't been before and will never go back.  It could have been so much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely will not come here again. The worst customer service in Waxhaw. I have tried on two separate occasions to eat here, and I've learned my lesson. First time, I ordered wings for pickup. They put my order in and I went to go pick them up in 30 minutes. They told me they didn't have any chicken and I'll have to get something else. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?   Second time was today, I ordered 20 wings medium and hot and I received 9 wings - mild and hot. Not at all what I ordered. I called them and the girl told me to come get the other 10. I only get 30 minutes for lunch and they wasted all of it. I told them I wanted a refund and they told me I had to physically come in to get it. They refunded me $11 off of $22, which they absolutely should have refunded the whole thing. So when I realized they only refunded me half, I went back in. The girl told me she couldn't and that the owner only approved an $11 refund. She told me I got 10 wings, so I should pay for 10 wings. First of all, I got 9 wings. Second of all, they were the wrong flavor. She told me they don't have medium flavor. THEN WHY DID YOU TAKE MY ORDER FOR MEDIUM?? She refused to give me a full refund and I told her I would not be back, nor any of the countless people that ask me what's a good restaurant in Waxhaw. Absolutely horrible way to treat a customer that you've messed up their order and wasted their time."}
{"text":"I have had a delicious meal at the Stuffed Olive every time I have been there.  I love, love, LOVE (pardon me for shouting but that's how good it is) their lasagna.  Their weekend brunch is the best breakfast in Waxhaw.  Don't let the dark interior fool you; once your eyes adjust you will feast on fabulous brunch items.  The eggs benny rocks."}
{"text":"Staff extremely unimpressive. I came in with a party of seven; after being seated and being the only people in the restaurant and having two autistic children in our party we asked if we can order off their lunch menu instead. The waitress said that even though the kitchen was open and fully staffed and there was no one else in the restaurant that our request would not be accommodated and that it was per the owner's policy and if she did it for us she would have to do if for everyone. Uhm... Seriously. I think I can smell bull a mile away.  Anyone with disabled friends or family members stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this restaurant. The first time I went to try it, the host informed us they couldn't take credit cards because their system was down so we left. When we came back, we made a reservation because we had a party of 10. Most of our meals were soggy and tasted like they had been microwaved. There were no good options for dietary restrictions. We will not go back. No one was in the restaurant either time we went so I am surprised they are still open."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place on Wednesday nights! The staff is attentive to dietary restrictions, and they are willing to go above and beyond to ensure you are happy with your meal. As if this wasn't enough, the bottles of wine are half price on Wednesday's. If you are looking for a mid-week treat, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Waxhaw is picking up some bars. The Stuffed Olive is one of them. Got a chance to pop in recently for a couple of beers with some co workers. Nice selection of craft beers. It wasn't too busy on a Monday night except for a few regulars. I did try the fried pickles, not bad, not bad at all. Next time I'm in Waxhaw I'll be sure to stop in again."}
{"text":"The outside and inside don't do the food justice. My husband had the chicken parmesan sandwich with chips and I went with the mussels appetizer and small side salad as my meal. The food takes a little longer probably Because they actually put some TLC into it. My mussels were cooked to perfection and had some high quality Parmesan cheese shaved on the top, yum-o! The portions are large and the mussels were more than enough for a large lunch. My husbands sandwich was probably as big as his head but didn't stop him from taking it down :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed! A guy took over for the female bartender, took my cash and I never got the change! Nice to assume my change was a tip. I WON'T BE BACK!!"}
