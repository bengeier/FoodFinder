{"text":"Had dinner tonight at this restaurant with my husband. All in all I wasn't impressed. Pizza was very flimsy and soggy. Cesar salad had little flavour. Penne a la vodka was very good. Service was awful. Our waiter was too busy so she had another server take our order. She then proceeded to not ever come to our table and we had no waiter the whole evening. we had to ask for everything - drinks, water refills and hot oil multiple times. We had to ask to pay our bill multiple times. Asked for the manager to come over and he never showed. After waiting about 15 minutes we just left. Do not recommend and will never return."}
{"text":"I went in January for dinner and enjoyed the menu and service.  Went back with my husband to find the menu had been  changed and I found the wine very over priced.   Disappointing. Not worth the money"}
{"text":"Just a fabulous Italian restaurant. Their pizza is among the best we've had and their other dishes, including pasta, are just beautiful. Make sure to check outthe daily specials, the list can be extensive. Motorino is gorgeous inside, with a really cool vibe topped off with good service. A must visit in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I hosted my birthday party on Sept.3/2016 at Motorino and they did a fantastic job! We were a party of 14 and the service was phenomenal. The waiter let us split bills, was so knowledgable about the menu and was very attentive. The food was fantastic and all my guests were happy. I'm so glad we booked our party here and would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"Had to chime in since the scores were so low. Have eaten here approx 6 times and loved it every time. Have tried most of the appetizers and the Marguerita, Margherita DOP, and Sophia pizzas. Their pizza is the best I've had and yes I've been to Pizza Libretto and AutoStrata. I also think the Tiramisu is the best I've had. So light, almost frothy. You are better off with a reservation but for a party of 2 you can sit at the bar until a table becomes available."}
{"text":"This used to be the go to restaurant for dinners after work or on the weekends with both family and friends.  Everything in the menu was great, especially the Specials and the Pizza. Service was great too although the place was always very busy.   For the past couple of months this restaurant is starting to lose its vibe - all the previous staff are not there anymore and the service is not great although the place is half empty.  The food is also not consistent and it often looks messy on the plate.  The Specials' board only has a few specials.. Drove by to have dinner last night around 8:00PM and there was only 1 table in the restaurant - I have never seen Motorino empty like that before.   I understand there are new owners - if they don't maintain the restaurant as it was before, including the food and service, they will lose all the clientele and it's a shame because Motorino is a great restaurant. Don't try to change the restaurant; it was successful before for a reason!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had the worst server in the restaurant.  She was a blond woman with glasses and seemed to be spending more time socializing at the bar vs. waiting on tables.  Our food took over an hour and even then one entree was missing.  Never received any refills on our water and we also made the mistake of ordering dessert...  The dessert took another half an hour and our ice cream was fully melted.    I am quite sure this is an awesome restaurant, but we just had the worst server employed there.  Hopefully mgmt knows who this server is based on my description, they see this review, and take disciplinary action.    Very disappointed, will not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and the food was amazing both times around. The first time I went with a couple of friends and we decided to try out a bunch of dishes and share them between all of us. Even though it was a little pricey the service was amazing and our waiter was very knowledgeable and stopped by many times to see how things were going. I knew that I would definitely come back again. The second time around is the reason why I knocked off a star, instead of giving the full 5 which I would have after the first visit. Just like the last time the food was incredible, I ordered the mushroom risotto which is hands down the best risotto I have had! The restaurant itself has a great vibe and looks very up to date. My main complaint has to do with the service we received. We started off with one server who poured our drinks and said he would be back shortly to take our orders. We both decided pretty quickly on what dish to ordered however our server had disappeared. After waiting and waiting we ended up flagging down a different server who ended up taking over for the rest of the night. The second guy was a lot better and managed to turn the evening around completely. I would definitely recommend checking them out for their great food."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place as its close to home but unfortunately will not return. The first part of our night went well...the place was not busy at all so we were quickly seated, good vibe, trendy decor, youthful and family-friendly. Our waiter started out great - very personable tho the poor guy had to spend almost 5 minutes on his spiel about the 12+ items on Special. He provided some good recommendations on apps and mains. The octopus salad was a great kick-start to the night. This was followed by an avocado and burrato stromboli which was over a foot-long and very filling (they messed up this order by putting ham in it but we took it because it looked yummy). We only had a small piece each in order to save room for the mains. Well that wasnt necessary since we hardly touched the mains - the papardelle was over-cooked and sticking together and the fennel salad was very over-dressed. The biggest dissapointment were the fridge-temperature meatballs - not room temperature, but they were actually cold inside. We couldnt find out waiter for a while and twice had to ask different staff to retrieve him. The hostess/manager was good about taking care of these items on the bill and providing complementary dessert. Based on the other positive reviews, this place could be a hit or miss but I definitely wouldn't chance it again."}
{"text":"Walked in to the new location in king city. Ordered take-out, service is a joke. I ordered 2 orders of the Spanish octopus, Frittura de pesce, and DOP margarita pizza. I was told it would take 15 minutes (took more like 40 minutes) I left the lady who took my order at bar 15$ tip! Not even a thank you! Got home within a few minutes to open my food the octopus was disgusting! Smelled like rotten fish, went straight to the garbage ! Frittura de pesce was basically all stuck together, taste was decent nothing better then the calamari you would get keg. Pizza was incredible! The 2 stars is completely for the pizza otherwise I would give a 0! Waste of $110."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week with a colleague. The service was very friendly and attentive.   I ordered the salad to start (mista) and I had the rib steak for my main. The salad was fresh, perfectly dressed, and a huge portion. This was an entree sized portion of salad. My rib steak was flavourful but it was rare rather than my requested medium rare. I'd rather have my steak under than over, so I didn't bother complaining about it. Again, the portions of their entrees are huge. I ate about 2/3 of my steak, most of my rapini and didn't touch my mashed potatoes and I was super full.  The bread they serve with roasted garlic on the side and hot pepper-infused oil was delicious as well.  If you like Italian food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My second time at this restaurant. Decent food, causal atmosphere, good portions, and reasonable prices.  Dined here on a Friday night. Walked in without a reservation at quarter to 7 and was seated without issue. The restaurant was pretty busy though so we may have lucked out getting a table.   They have my favourite wine by the glass (caymus cab sauv) so the restaurant is an automatic winner in my books!   They have tons of specials so no worries if you don't like anything on their menu!   I ordered the salumiere plate to start. You really can't go wrong with cured meats, and you get tons of it for $18! My friend ordered the caprese Di bufala which was kinda disappointing. The tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough and the bufala wasn't as creamy or flavourful as one would like. I ordered one of the meat specials (Tagliata di manzo with truffled salad for $32) - which was essentially a carved steak with an arugula salad. I love arugula salad, but I must admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't come as a fancy schmancy salad as the name suggested. The steak was a bit veiny but probably my fault for ordering a not so great cut of meat rare. My friend ordered the salmon special which looked fantastic. I didn't try the fish, but I did steal a brussel sprout and it was pretty good (and I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts at all!). Ended the meal with a latte (very unremarkable) and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was a lot more cream than I had expected, but I really enjoyed it.  Service was good albeit unmemorable. A decent place for a laid back casual dinner!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  I have been here numerous times and the food, service and atmosphere have always been outstanding.  Today we had the calzone di Napoli for lunch and it was absolutely delicious.  Thanks to Kirk, Frank and Temo for a wonderful experience here, yet again!  Oh! The live music on Thursday nights is great too! Lots of fun! I didn't like that they charge you $2 per person if you bring in your own birthday cake seeing as we spent quite a bit on food and alcohol."}
{"text":"We went there for late lunch on Sunday. We biked there and with a 3 year old daughter. Felt a little under dressed for the place, but everyone there was very nice and friendly. Very happy with what we ordered and the service too! We want to try their dinner and I feel like I know it's gonna be a great one too!"}
{"text":"Went with small group for a birthday. Waiter sucked, couldn't be bothered with us, rolling his eyes etc. The only thing he did was bring us our drinks and water one time around. Needless to say he got a bad tip from me. The bus boy was fabulous we all wished he was our waiter. I do have to say I had the penne allá vodka.... Was delish. Best I've had. Drinks Yuk they need to improve their wine list big time.  Atmosphere was ok like old diner style. A little crowded but ok. I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"I Absolutely love this place.  The food is very good.  The service is pleasant and the atmosphere is very welcoming"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Motorino Enoteca on Saturday for a casual lunch with another couple and their 10-month old. We couldn't have been more pleased with the excellent customer service, the amazing atmosphere and the mouth-watering array of  food.  The red and black Motorino theme runs throughout the entire space and is carried through the large dining room and into the clean open kitchen with a huge wood-burning pizza oven. We were seated right away and the wait staff was there to offer water and drinks while we waited for our guests. When they arrived, the staff were already bringing out a high-chair for the baby before they even made it to our table. We started with the Lobster Arancini, Cavolfiore (crispy cauliflower) and the DOP Margherita Pizza with Bamboo Charcoal crust. All the appetizers were plentiful and well-received by us all. The Lobster Arancini had a good amount of Lobster and we all enjoyed the crispy cauliflower (even the 10-month old couldn't get enough of it!). The Pizza with the Charcoal crust was delicious, as well as being really good for you with over 400 medicinal minerals and ancient grains. Our main dishes were a variety of salads, pastas and fish. I had the Avocado Farro Salad and it was plentiful and scrumptious. The kitchen staff were also able to put together a dish of chicken and gnocchi for the baby, which was greatly appreciated by the parents. I can't say enough about how impressed we were by the entire lunch. Our guests were really pleased and were already making plans to go back before we left. We will definitely be back and plan on taking any guests that are visiting foodies."}
{"text":"YAAAS   My friend and I wanted to go for a pizza & wine night and decided to try this place for the first time.   I quite liked it very much. Quite pricey but id say worth it.  We ordered the Avocado Bocconcini for appetizer. The server seemed concerned & asked us if we knew what that was , & my friend was italian so shes like yea !  When it came , we realized why. It was pretty big, & we werent aware of the size just as he had assumed haha.  Refer to photo ive attached   We also ordered the margherita & Calvi pizza , before we knew we were gonna be full with our appetizer alone lol .  The pizzas were delicious as well , def love chilly oil on the side to put on it .   Cute place overall, & pretty busy too!  Will be back"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a family function.  I had no idea there was even a restaurant in this area being that it's in a small strip mall but it takes up most of the space, about half it seems.  The inside of this restaurant is really visually striking.  The red and black theme is throughout the interior from the signs, walls, and tables.    The menu has a mixed of antipasto, salads, pasta, meats, fish, risotto and pizzas.  It's a decent mix of dishes and choices.  I ended up getting the quattro stagione and my wife had ordered the white potato pizza.  The quattro stagione literally translated means four seasons.  I'm used to seeing this pizza's ingredients on each of the 4 quarters pizzas like quadrants.  I didn't get it that way for some reason.  All the ingredients (mushrooms, prosciutto, olives and artichokes) were evenly spread across the pizza.  It was still decent but just not what I was expecting to see.  My wife ate about half of her potato pizza.  Typically if we go to a place that serves pizza she'll always go with a white pizza (no red sauce) if it's an option and she likes potato pizza in general where ever she can find it.  She only ate half of it as she usually does but she said it was too greasy.  I was too full to have any of her pizza since I ate all of mine at the restaurant.  The potato pizza came with onions and pancetta.  I'm used to pancetta being thicker and more fatty like bacon.  Honestly this pancetta looked like deli sliced cooked ham.  We took home the left overs and I ended up eating them that night.  I have to say the potato pizza was very greasy I have to agree with my wife.  The bottom crust was in fact saturated and it wasn't pretty.  Overall the pizzas weren't out of this world and I can safely say that in the GTA we've had much better than this.  It seemed that the toppings weren't very generous or distributed properly.  I mean the quattro stagione is not even in quarters.  Don't get me wrong I've had Neapolitan style pizza before so I know what to sort of expect and mind you this place although not VPN certified like Libretto or Pizza e Pazzi doesn't have to be like many other places out there but I simply found this pizza to be not as good all around.    Whether it's the thickness of the crust or the ingredients simply put it's not as good as some of the other non-VPN Neapolitan type style pizza out there in the GTA (850 Degrees, Napoli Centrale).  It is IMO a notch lower than Grazie.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu but as far as the pizza for me, this is not a go to place.  The service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"It's a pity. It was very nice restaurant. Right now I'm having lunch. It's empty. Including us 4 people. Before it was packed. employees look unhappy. I went to washroom. It was dirty. No soap no paper. How did they turn in too bad from an outstanding restaurant it's unbelievable. . It's going to be my last visit."}
{"text":"If you want an outstanding pizza, this is the place!  Atmosphere: Modern, edgy and themed. Cleanliness: Great Constructive criticism: N/A  Cuisine: Italian Facilities: Clean Food: excellent, unique, and quality in mind. Great flavors captured. Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: deffinitley Parking: Private, although tight since the lot is small. Portion Sizes: fair Price: a little high Service: Professional, knowledgable, and warm Selection: Wide variety of italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing to tell anyone about, service was slow and the specials was over priced and the list was cumbersome. Staff seem unfriendly and they served our app and main together? Asked if we needed anything then forgot about us? Was really expecting so much more"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and decided to save my review until after the second visit. This place is yummy! The menu has plenty of enticing options. The plates are generous, fresh, colorful and delicious. Much thought is put in to plating. There are several daily specials for you to choose from as well. Great wine selection. Cocktails are strong. Even the dessert is fantastic. Nothing bad to say. My new favorite local Italian eatery."}
{"text":"Got their neopolitan pizza for takeout - was very good!"}
{"text":"We were here in a small group of girls for a friends bday, the food and service weren't great. Menu is full of carbs, alcohol drinks are very expensive and service was probably the worst. Our waiter was a young guy who could not be bothered with doing his job. He made us feel like we were bugging him and a couple times we had to go to the bar and bug the bus boy for refills and water. Upside the bus boy was fantastic, very helpful and personable, we wished he was our waiter! I've been to much better Italian restaurants in Vaughan, I won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Motorino is one of the restaurants in my neighbourhood, so expectations at finding another great place to dine at were high. Needless to say, since my initial visit I have yet to go back. The place has a youthful, high energy vibe about ........one would hope the food and the service would live up to the hype. We arrived without a reservation so we had to wait for a table to become available. Certainly not the restaurants fault. We perused the menu while waiting and the wait was only approx. 10 minutes. The smells in the restaurant were intoxicating.....so by the time our waiter came by for a drink order, we were ready to order our food. Waiters attitude was off-putting, as though he was doing us the favour by  allowing himself to be our server. We ordered and off he went.......never came back to check on us. He did stop by a table near to us as he had friends in dining that night and actually sat with them for a few minutes chatting.....all while we had empty drink glasses in front of us. We had to flag him down on one of his many trips past us for a drink refill order.  Food arrived after a substantial wait (it was very busy so one must expect the kitchen to be overwhelmed) but it was unmemorable. Two of us had ordered pizza...and both agreed we've had much better elsewhere. The other members of our party were equally unimpressed with their food.  Obviously this restaurant is going for a younger crowd than us (lol) but the noise, combined with average food flavour, warrants this rating.  We have not gone back"}
{"text":"They sat us (group of two, our 10 year anniversary), we waited 15 minutes for them to take our drink order.  I flagged down a waiter walking by who was serving us, he said he was and he would be right there to take our order.  Waited another 20 minutes and left.   Our waiter was serving the large group next to us who was arriving.  As they arrived he was taking their drink orders and they got theirs immediately even before they sat down.    Never going back"}
{"text":"I visited this place for a friends birthday. Beautiful ambience, cosy seating and a warm welcome. The food on the menu was very tempting. But then I was struck with horror when I ordered the special which had a whole fish (deboned) served on a bed of fennel risotto.. I have never tasted anything so horrific in my life... the fish was bland had no taste just as the risotto ... It was like hospital food .. I also had small bones in my fish to which the server said very smartly ... \"even if I deboned the fish in front of you there would be a few left \" what the hell did that mean .... I didn't argue with him as I was at someone's party but that was the stupidest thing I have heard .... deboned means no bones .... !! And always ask them for the price of the dish if you get tempted to order a special ...as they never mention the price to you and charge what they like..!! Charging me 40 bucks for a taste less fish and risotto was ridiculous...  My wife ordered a pizza and I must say it was nice ... that' all folks ... remember specials only sound tempting but was absolute hospital food"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding! They always go above and beyond when serving. The food is fantastic! We are already repeat customers and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We had a quick dinner recently. We originally called and they told me they can only seat us at 930. But we were in the neighborhood and thought to try our luck at 8. Got the bar seats. But there were so many empty tables around us !!  The food was okay. I want to highlight the octopus dishes and the charcoal veggie pizza. The octopus was soooo fishy and chewy, way more than expected. It took a few bites to get used to. But if thats your kinda thing, I'd imagine youd love it. The main reason to come here to try the pizza. It was not as I expected. It was a little dry and the black olives were extremely salty.  Not a big deal, we just picked it off.  Overall, the staff were friendly, the atmosphere was nice and the food was okay. I'd go back."}
{"text":"At first, we had a server who was extremely rough and careless where he started greeting us on Father's day with, \"we need the table back in an hour and a half.\" After awkwardly seated, luckily there was another server who took over and redeemed the first impression and experience as a whole!  The pastas were mediocre- we had the gnocchi and the carbonara. Both were very overcooked where the noodles were very soft. The pizzas were much better and it was neat how you can choose between 3 styles of how the pizza is cooked. Crust was perfect."}
{"text":"Motorino Enoteca does have a modern and youth decoration. Loud, high energy and quite chic. I just wish the food and the services can be as high energy as the vibe!  Dropping by for a late lunch and the services was just indifferent and slow.  My Rigatoni alla Norma (Fried eggplant, light tomato sauce and Imported riotta salata) for $16 is not bad in taste but definitely overpriced.   No bread was ever offered... wish I have that to dip it in the tomato sauce.  Maybe it just me, if I ordered rounds and rounds of drinks, my services maybe a lot better?  There are so many options of good Italian food in the area, I think I am going to skip Motorino!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to eat at this unfriendly place. The staff made us feel that they were doing us a favour for eating at their restaurant. The wait staff was a joke. We started out with an Italian waiter that could not be understood since his English was terrible, he mumbled and treated us as we never have been to an Italian restaurant. He also looked dirty with a pencil mustache. He kept coming back to our table even though we told him that we are not ready to order. We then got a replacement of another useless waiter. This guy was spraying tables like a lunatic with sterilizer that could be smelled from across the room. When will they learn to spray the liquid on the rag?  So if anyone is looking for over dressed salads, oily pastas, heartburn pizza and bad espresso this is the place. Downtown prices poorly executed dishes. The food ingredients were fresh. Only positive.  Italian mall food would be better."}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious Italian food I've had. I was surprised by how cool the inside of this restaurant looked since the outside is just black but it's awesome. My boyfriend and I ordered an app and two pasta dishes. The servers we had were very nice. They filled up our water, cleared our plates in a timely fashion. The server brought us bread while we waited for our app and the butter/ginger/garlic dressing that came with it was different and yummy. Our appetizer was so fresh and crispy! Our main pasta dishes were just as fresh and filling. We even forked out some room for tiramisu which I cannot even explain how creamy it was. One of the beat tiramisu's I've had. The only thing that wasn't that great was the turnover time between meals because they make the food fresh (i think) but definitely worth the $$. Two thumbs up!"}
