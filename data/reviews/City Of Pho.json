{"text":"Came here last week with couple of friends. I order a large house special noodle soup and a spring roll. It was really good. Especially the broth for the noodle soup. Great service and clean."}
{"text":"I came here today, I normally judge the taste first, sanitary , the size, the service and the prizes is last because you pay what you get. I ordered vermicelli with pork and egg roll, My meal suppose to be above standard, unfortunately the egg roll is way below the average, it is stuffed full of taro, very disappointed. Sanitary: it's clean and neat. Size: I'm not a big eater, I'm not too hungry, I would say it's regular size. I packed my left over, I can't finished them all. Service: Not busy when I was there, therefore it's above standard. Prize: You paid what you get, the prize here is average. I would like to see the improvement of the egg roll, so my next visit will add more star.... Thank you, Mary"}
{"text":"Spoiler: very average pho place  Order & atmosphere: We stumbled upon this new pho restaurant that replaced the previous one. My wife ordered the P1 (Special house pho $5.75 small) and i ordered the V4 sans bean sprouts (grilled chicken + spring roll vermicelli $6.95). Decor was kept the same as the previous restaurant. Decent quick eatery atmosphere.  Service & food quality: it was sometimes difficult to get the staff attention but they responded quickly after seeing us. My wife's pho came very quick. The soup tasted a little artificial to us (i.e. similar to instant). The noodles and meat were decent and your run of the mill quality. The grilled chicken vermicelli came a few mins after the pho but both were relatively quick coming out of the kitchen. The grilled chicken and veggies both tasted fresh but smaller than normal portion. The spring roll had alot of taro and seemed tough to chew.   Overall: Decent place to get a quick meal but nothing spectacular. Probably wouldn't visit again unless i was in a rush or a friend wanted to go."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent customer when it was under old ownership. When the restaurant changed hands, I visited not long after and found the food to be OK.   Now months later, I make another visit and am rather disappointed. 1) they seem to be using potatoes as fillers. Ordered the grill beef with rice, it looked good until I realised the beef was stirred fried with potatoes. Same with the spring roll, again good size but when I bit into it, it was filled with and all I could taste was potatoes.  2) ordered the xl sized pho. Usually that means everything is super sized, meats + noodles. Only the noodles were supersized :("}
{"text":"City of Pho is a newly open Vietnamese restaurant inside Market Village.  The set up is identical to the previous business just with a change of colour theme. The menu is quite simple with the usual pho, speciality noodles, bun and rice dishes.   Dine in Special: fresh fruit juice/slush for $1.99 instead of $3.99. My watermelon slush was freshing.  P1 Special Pho ($6.95/large) was decent in meat and noodle portion. The broth has a nice herbal undertone and well flavoured!   City Pho might be a good option if you have a craving for pho while shopping in Market Village!"}
{"text":"I am actually not sure how to rate this restaurant.  I am puzzled because I ordered a small raw beef pho for lunch 2 days ago.  What arrived looked like a decent size small pho, and I know this will not be not a large pho at other Vietnamese restaurants, such as Kim Po.  The bill that arrived at end of meal, however, charged me for a large pho.  Therefore, did they mix up my order, so a large pho was made, and I had eaten a small-ish large pho?  Or did they mix up the invoice, so a small pho was made, and I had eaten a decent size small pho?  I paid silently without making a scene.  Regardless, the pho tasted fine.  Service was fast, but I can't tell if it is accurate.  If it is accurate, then the portion of the large pho is atmost a medium size at other Vietnamese restaurants.    Still puzzled."}
