{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here. Food is fresh and service is fast and courteous. We love the all you can eat sushi. This is definitely one of our favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this little gem at the (far)western edge of Cheyenne Ave.  For those you you sushi mavens out there who do not live in the area, let me assure you that the trip is well worth the \"trouble\". Their sushi has been uniformly fresh and delicious every time we've gone. Their cooked dishes have been wonderful as well.  We've enjoyed their creations for both lunch and dinner.  The service has always been professional.  Just one word of advice GO!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb is definitely my go to sushi spot!! The place is very stylish and serve great quality food! The service is very friendly, and I would recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"PAUL puts the BOMB in Sushi Bomb !!!!! It was our first time there and we were a little confused on what to order. Paul gave us all his recommendations from every section of the menu!!! It was amazing food and great service! I would highly recommend Sushi Bomb and Paul made our experience 100% better!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, pretty fresh. Terrible service...had to ask for the simplist things multiple times. Just getting our miso soup took 20 minutes in a mostly empty resturaunt. Very inexperienced servers. Would not recommend and will not come again."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a friend, it was close to my parent's house so we didn't have to travel very far, and we didn't want to wait very long to be seated.   In the beginning service was slow. They had a party of 12 that was here before us but they were getting dessert after we sat down for about 10 minutes. Seemed like they were more attentive after I whipped out my yelp coupon for free draft beer for checking in. It   Nigiri definitely has way too much rice on it. The fish was pretty fresh but sliced so paper thin I could see through it. Almost like they were trying to ration their fish.   When the server delivered our combo tempura a freaking ant came with it!!!   They don't do half rolls unless it's your very last roll. The rolls are the standard portion of rice but some looked scaled down.   In the end the menu is pretty large with a lot of variety just don't expect large portions.   Would I come back? Probably not due to the traveling distance."}
{"text":"Although the food is tasty the menu is unclear and the \"alll you can eat\" is hardly all you can eat!! There are loop holes all over the menu that limit what you can choose and how much you can have!  The dessert is apparently one item per person although it is not stated anywhere!! In addition there are items reserved for dinner only but it is listed nowhere on the menu that they are off limits for lunch. I will not be visiting this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"I was there for business lunch and we were the only ones there. I know it's not that busy but the sushi guy just sat at the table on the phone and one of his shoes off. It was unprofessional. I sat at the bar but the server had to take my order which I have no problem with but clearly she was doing something else in the back. I'm not gonna try to get his attention  if I need anything. Food was good.get a star for food."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my first visit to Sushi Bomb! I had the \"Hooters\" roll twice, the \"Japanese\" and \"Korean\" rolls, and finished up with their plum ice cream for dessert. I cannot wait until I visit Sushi Bomb again!"}
{"text":"Slooow service! Doesn't matter if you call ahead and order pick up they will have you waiting! Waste my whole lunch break waiting for food!"}
{"text":"This has been my regular sushi place for about a year and I have never been disappointed. The menu and food are pretty decent and the service is always good. Their AYCE is definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Very good bento boxes. Sushi was fresh and checking in gets you a free beer which is cool. I think the sashimi dishes could be a bit bigger for the price. For 13 or 14 dollars only 6 thin slices is not a great deal."}
{"text":"Very good sushi! All you can eat is the way to go but always order 4 rolls at a time so you don't wait to long. The rolls are nice and tight with very good flavor. This place is highly recommended! The only reason I give them a 3 star is because our first time there nobody acknowledged us for 10 min after seating us, we had to get up and walk away!"}
{"text":"By far, the best sushi restaurant in town!  My best friend and I have been coming here once a month for about 10 months. We've never had an issue with the service, but a couple of months ago, a new guy and he's been our waiter the last two times--he's hilarious! Upbeat, energetic and funny!   The rolls just can't be beat. They are all delicious, our favorite being Sex on the Beach and One Night Stand. There was one roll that we had never tried before, The Red Tiger, but our server insisted we try it a couple months ago and it's now another one of our favorites. Last month when we were in, he remembered what we ordered, which is always nice. A lot of their rolls are spicy, but that's fine for us--we love spicy foods.  Two large-screen TVs are really nice during football season too. The staff is really good about letting you pick what channel you want to watch.  I have tried a few other sushi places in town (Sushi Bomb isn't around the corner from my house, so when I go out with my daughter, we try places near home) and I always end up not liking the other places and I always compare them to Sushi Bomb. Nothing compares.  For the price and the service and the flavor and variety, I can't find a better place in town. So delicious."}
{"text":"The place is cute neighbor restaurant.  It was a Saturday night and the place was half full.  I expected it to be busier.   The food was not what I wanted.  It seemed to me the majority of the rolls had either eel in them or they were spicy.  I can't stand eel and my best friend doesn't eat spicy so we really had a problem looking at what rolls to eat.  We asked if we could sub spicy tuna for regular tuna and the server didn't understand what we were saying.  I had major issues with the service but will get to that later.  Back to the food....we ordered tempura which pieces were so undercooked we couldn't eat it.   Seriously, I have no idea what veggie it was.   It was like a rock.  The rolls were so so.  Nothing stood out.   Ok I understand they had some issues with service being bad.  Being in the industry I consider myself a little more patient than others.  It wasn't like they ignored us, it was the complete opposite.  I couldn't finish a sentence without them coming and asking us how everything was.   We told them to leave the menus, 3 different people tried to take them.   I asked them questions about the menu and they had no idea what some of the items were.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.   Personally, I love it that they asked how we were doing but really, every 2 minutes.  Annoying.   They need to find a balance with the service."}
{"text":"I've only ordered sushi to go from Sushi Bomb, but the sushi was fresh and very good. They made my order quickly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb was ok. If you're going to get your roll fix, this will do, but the nigiri is much to be desired. My husband and I tried it a week ago while we were in the area and weren't impressed with the nigiri. The service was fast and the rolls fine, but the nigiri was cut so thin that all I could taste was rice. We did all you can eat, but I gave up quickly because it wasn't worth it. I was hoping this would be my new sushi place since it's close to my house, but not so much."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant expecting a great time considering the various positives reviews I've heard about it. Was given the opposite: gross dining conditions, rude waiters/waitresses, and an even ruder manager. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was just there this past weekend for the first time. Went for the AYCE and it did not disappoint. The sushi rolls are really good. Try the canyon, mountain and volcano. We are definitely making this place our sushi spot. Service was good. We had a waiter and a waitress. Waitress was very warm, attentive and friendly. Overall, this place is worth trying if you are looking for a new sushi spot. Can't wait 'til next time."}
{"text":"First off, id like to start off by saying I NEVER come on yelp to complain, generally, I am always giving out excellent reviews, but this experience was BEYOND unacceptable I felt I needed to share. First and foremost my family comes to sushi bomb OFTEN at least 3 times a month. My mom asked me to go with to try out the place. We had 13 people total and out of the 13, 10 of us were all you can eat, our bill was over 400 dollars. AYCE for almost 30 dollars a piece was definitely not worth it when you can find it cheaper with WAY better service. The service here was literally by far the worst service I have ever received at a sushi restaurant! My son is only 3 years old and they took a while to bring out his sushi so he took ONE and I mean ONE piece of my sushi and they literally came up to me and told me he cannot share off of me. Seriously, how much can a 3 year old eat from my plate? I ordered him his entire own roll but it was taking a while to come and I'm not going to sit there and watch my son starve as we are all eating. After that, they also scolded my 7 year old who ate 3 edamames from my sisters AYCE. Seriously 3 edamames. It was honestly so disrespectful. And to top it off, they wanted to charge us for 6 pieces of sushi that was left out of 10 AYCE!!! Seriously??? The bill is over 400 bucks and you want to charge us over 6 pieces of uneaten sushi? That is absolutely ridiculous. My husband was forced to eat the last 6 pieces and literally came home and vomited. Another thing that upset me was that I guess they have 2 dollar draft Sapporo for AYCE. They failed to tell us that until the very end after we had ordered 30 dollars in regular Sapporo not knowing the draft was INCREDIBLY cheaper. They're money hungry and don't care at all about service, only the money they can take from your pocket. It's ridiculous the way they treated me and my family considering the amount we were spending plus 18% tip. They need waaay better service. Sushi was ok, just like every other place here in Vegas, nothing OUT OF THIS WORLD, by any means. Take your money else where with better service and better sushi. Also waitresses jasmine and jen were incredibly disrespectful and need to reconsider their positions as waitresses. They have lost a total of 18 people's business! Way to go sushi bomb"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I've always loved it here. It is by far my favorite place to grab some sushi and hang out with friends and drink. I don't know how long they have had the AYCE, but i know its been awhile now. They never had it a couple years ago. The service is always good when I've been here. My favs are the special d rolls, x-girlfriend rolls, and the bacon wrapped scallops."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit to sushi bomb. Its got good atmosphere and the $1.99 all you can drink Sapporo is a big plus!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas! Great customer service and the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best AYCE I've been to with tons of different option and out server Jenn was super friendly and helpful...."}
{"text":"A+ food for the price. It's a little far from the strip but this is probably the best all you can eat sushi in the city."}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of AYCE sushi places in Vegas, and this is one of my all-time favorites. The pork belly is better than any other I've tried-- it melts in your mouth! The monkey brain is also a must-order.   The staff is very friendly, and they get the sushi to you in good time. I've been here quite a few times, and the company I've brought always finds it to be a great place too."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I love the atmosphere and the staff. So friendly, always makes us feel welcome. The food is awesome! I always do all you can eat and you can't  beat the options you have to enjoy. Your seated pretty quickly no matter how busy it is. They are so nice, whenever they see my 4 year old... they do little things to make her smile. Like letting her play with the stuff on the counter or giving her a sushi sucker every time we leave. Great food awesome staff, I'd recommend this place to all my sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Comfy, fish is  pretty good, definitely good enuf ( I'm here on a Sunday ) , nice local neighborhood spot... very casual, cute place, worth it if u live nearby"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place!! My husband had the Sushi Bomb roll and I had the Steak Hibachi.  The food was excellent and the staff very friendly. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Visited Sushi Bomb for the first time couple days ago during lunch time and I love it the waiter John was very nice and attentive. I had the deep fried Sibuya Roll which was recommended to me by John and it was amazing. i will be definitely going back soon for the amazing food and Great waiter."}
{"text":"All you can eat $25. How could you go wrong? The sushi is very good. And the hot food as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. We are regulars here almost on a weekly basis. The people are lovely and the atmosphere is relaxing. If you're hungry go for the all you can eat at $27 per person. It's worth it! I highly recommend this place. My favorite roll is the tiger roll."}
{"text":"I tried this place last year when it didn't offer AYCE and I liked it a lot.  I was excited to go back now that they offer AYCE, so I could try more rolls and see if their quality was still good.    And I was happy to find out -- it is!  We gave them a visit the other night and tried about nine different rolls between us... and I can't think of one thing to complain about on any of them.  Very fresh and VERY yummy.  I also thought the service was excellent.  They were great at keeping the rolls coming out one at a time, with no big lags between them.  They were also very friendly and didn't give us attitude (as some places do) when we wanted to order more.  I love the ambiance of this place, too.  Sure it's in a strip mall just like all of the other sushi places in Vegas, but the decor is really cute and the tables/chairs are nice and comfy. And even though the place was full, it wasn't too noisy at all.  There are only a couple small things that knock this rating down to a 4 from a 5 for me.  One... they don't allow you to order half-rolls, except for your very last order, which kinda bugs me.  And although they do let you order anything on the menu, their appetizer list is extreeeemely small.  I think they only offered 4-5 things.    Other than those small things, though, Sushi Bomb really was great!  We'll be going back again when our AYCE sushi craving hits and we want to stay on this side of town."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this place from two coworkers so I couldn't wait to eat there, took my boyfriend for his birthday instead of our usual spot because we were expecting something great and it was the complete opposite of great .   Service was HORRIBLE. Place had about three other tables pretty slow and still we couldn't get good service can't imagine it slammed . My daughter was with us she loves sushi and I had to wave a server down for children's chopsticks . We felt rush the whole time , and we had our server switch tables with another server and both of them forgot about us , basically had to wave people down the whole time , which made me feel like I was being a B**ch but I wasn't , I just wanted good service , I serve and partially manage in a fast paced restaurant and that was not a good experience .   Food was just okay"}
{"text":"Came out here for Mother's Day. Ordered Tempura Udon, four variety sushi role, my boyfriend loved the bacon roll, seaweed salad, and a bottle of lychee sake. It was a packed day but the wait was 2 minutes. The waiters were very nice and friendly. One waiter, he was eager to clear out our table that he took my daughter's plate and she wasn't even done eating.  We didn't say anything to him, he seemed like he was distracted. Overall, good food, pricing is fair for sushi."}
{"text":"Your new menu is the worst. I used to love you. You've let me down. Never have I been so dissatisfied by restaurant that I had to write a review.... I'm sorry but I don't love you anymore :-("}
{"text":"Pros:  Good food, AYCE.  Cons:  Awful horrible service.  Honestly my FIRST negative review on Yelp.  The service was that bad that I could not let it go and to inform others. Literally read reviews from 2 months ago complaining about the same thing.  Let me preface that we came in a whole hour before closing which is decent time to order and eat, so I understood that last call for food was 30 min before closing.  Our server was just impatient, rude, and unhappy.  It was to the point I almost wanted to have her sit down and breath and talk about why it seems she hates her job so much to make the customers feel so uncomfortable and awkward.  The sushi men behind the bar we're irritated and unhappy, as if they we're pissed we came in since they seemed they wanted to close up early and go home.  It just felt we we're a burden to the whole staff.  We wished we could have left earlier, after an $80 bill for 2 people with poor service, I didn't want to even tip. Everyone is in customer service in some way, no need to be so unpleasant to people who want to have a nice dinner.  I MIGHT give a 2nd chance to see if there is any improvement, but honestly would rather drive the extra 7 miles to Chinatown for better service than have that experience again.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  The bad service just trumps the good food.. honestly that ridiculous.  Recommendation to management:  Please properly train your staff to wait on tables in a friendly manner, not in a \"hurry up and eat you food\" type of way.     Customers, you have been warned."}
{"text":"As soon as we arrive the chef prepares our favorite dish, Salmon Sushi.  When we sit down a few moments later our server sets the freshly prepared Sushi in front of us. The few seconds it takes to walk in the door and sit down, we already got food in front of us.  This has to be the best feeling ever, the fact that they remember us and care enough to begin to prepare our favorite dish is awesome!  Thats how it starts, let me tell you how it ends. Next we order! More Salmon Sushi! Check! A some some roll. Check! Salmon cheese sticks. Check! Baja Yellowtail roll. Check! Throw in some Salmon hand rolls. Double Check!! Rinse and repeat until full! We do the All You Can Eat, its so worth it.  Our favorite servers? You ask.  Hmmm  let me think. Gots to be a tie between Paul or Danny.   Pauls got the hair, but Danny is always on it. Its truly a tie between them, they are both great.   Now the bad, peak times like friday nights or saturday nights get a little hectic. So sometimes you have to be patient and wait for a table.   We usually try to go midday for lunch or late for dinner, 8'tish or after.  Thank you"}
{"text":"awesome sushi and great staff! the Orange blossom roll is amazing, have to give a try!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb is my favorite Sushi place I've found. My husband and I love to take our friends and family there to show it off. We love going for lunch, All You Can Eat for $19.95. Ask for the spicy edamame, not on the menu, but so worth it. This Guy, Love Affair, Sushi Bomb, and Ex-Girlfriend are just some of our favorites. If you are in the NW area and want some fantastic, fresh sushi, you've gotta check out Sushi Bomb. It even beats our fave place from when we lived in So Cal."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places for sushi and I eat there at least once a week but in the last month I have been super disappointed with the service.  The food is good when you actually get it and by that I mean that trying to get someone to take your order is becoming impossible.  Today I went and there was 1 other table of 2 eating and it took me 25 minutes to get my order taken.  There were 2 in my party and when the other person ordered, the waitress started to walk away so I said wait I need to order as well. I got the roll I ordered and my daughter got 2 of the 2 things she ordered but the rest never came.  We finished our food and she never once came by to check on us until she brought the bill.  I wasn't charged for it but I hate ordering stuff and not getting it.  This has been an issue I have had too many times so I think it's time for a break and a new place."}
{"text":"Told them we had a few people meeting us in a few minutes, they wouldn't serve us until everyone was there. Apparently they time you to the second and it'd be too hard to figure out.  Ridiculously unyielding. Will not add or substitute anything. For instance, they have an avocado asparagus roll yet will not add either to a menu item.  Had a couple people in our party ordering ayce and a younger teenager ordering ala cart. The appetizer portions are different sizes depending on how you order. The waitress freaked when the teenager started eating the wrong order.........didn't make sense, especially since the ayce order was smaller!!!  Sasa Sushi is just a few miles down the road, a place where the staff is waaay more friendly and they aren't worried about customizing an order for you."}
{"text":"This is my local sushi place and I'm a fan. The sushi quality is very good and they have a decent sake and beer selection. I'm the first to admit that the service can be hit and miss, but I'm not bothered by speaking up and asking for something. We usually eat at the bar when here and get plenty of attention."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Great fish and great prices and the people working there make your experience fun.  Ask D for his secret monkey ball roll or ask for the off-menu garlic edamame!"}
{"text":"We usually come here every 2 weeks or so. The service was always great. The staff was always friendly and attentive.  I guess they are under new management and they cleaned house. We came in tonight with new servers and staff. Our male server was a complete jerk from the beginning. He never smiled at us. When we all said we were doing \"all you can eat,\" he didn't believe us. He told us 20 minutes later that the kitchen was closing, but they weren't closing for another 45 minutes? Hmmm. He was totally rushing for us to leave. There was a female server that was helping him out--she was nice, but that's the only good thing i have to say about our experience.  All the while, while this was all happening, the owner was just sitting at a table just staring at us eat. Knowing we were unhappy about the service, and complaining to the female server, not once did he care to talk to us. Like a coward, he just sat from afar and stared.  Servers are supposed to earn their tips. That's why we eat out because we are paying for the service. We won't be back and i suggest no one else should if service like this continues."}
{"text":"We usually go to Goyemon but wanted to try somewhere new where we don't have to wait in line for an hour on weekend night. The quality of fish was good and I liked their small rice portion. My favorite was raw oysters, they were so fresh!! We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This is my new sushi spot!! The owner Su is very nice and was  very helpful from the moment we sat down.  We went on a Monday evening around 9PM and it was busy with about 6 tables.  There are 12 in the room plus the sushi bar.  We ordered all you can eat Sushi for $25.99 and for $3.99 more we had all you can drink beer (Saparo).    The sushi rolls were huge!! I've had Sushi Mon AYCE and the sushi is smaller/scaled down for AYCE patrons.  This sushi was huge!! Everything on the menu from appetizers to desserts and regular to special sushi rolls are includedin AYCE, except for Sashimi.    Over all the ambiance was very nice and clean.  The service was excellent.  I will be making this a regular spot!  I posted several pics!"}
{"text":"Update :   Would like to point out, that I am no fan of all you can eat, all you can drink, which some others list as their main reason for coming here.  Ask the chefs for their recommendations, based on the freshest ingredients, and you will not be disappointed.  The new menu tries to go a bit beyond California Roll, and if you are able to indicate to the chefs the flavors you like, they will deliver.  Be a bit bold, try something new, and understand that on your way, you may discover new favorites, as well as definitive No's."}
{"text":"Discovered this place August 2nd. Been there 3 times since. All you can eat (which I recommend) variety is delicious. And the service is faster than any other sushi place I've been to in vegas, and la. Hands down favorite sushi spot in Vegas out of the 7 or so places I've tried out here."}
{"text":"The name said it all...it's the bomb! Got the taster and lord was delicious! Wanted to try more but was full already"}
{"text":"As a new lover of Sushi this was my first time! We chose to sit at the bar. The staff is very attentive and polite. I tried the catepillar first and my taste buds were screaming. I don't have a favorite because every roll I try here I love! We even got a delicious honeybread dessert. The decor is just darling as well. Guess you will just have to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I honestly can't even figure out why they're still open. Three people got the all you can eat. The waitress was extremely rude, her name was Hee. She messed up our orders, and it took forever for everything to come out we ended up only getting 3 orders before they put the bill on our table after killing so much time on the order before having it come out. We probably waited 20 minutes for 1 roll to come out. When it came time to pay they also messed this up and couldn't figure out how to split a bill. This was absolutely terrible. Do not go."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but the severe is awful. I've been to sushi bomb twice, and both times I had terrible service! The servers are extremely rude and they stand behind you, and just watch you eat! At first, I thought maybe it was a language barrier but as they continued to slam the plates down, not bring the food we ordered, and could careless to refill our drinks, I figured out it wasn't the language. I feel like there's so many good sushi places in vegas, that they need to improve to stay open. BE CAREFUL, cause they added extra items on our bill."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  The staff is always super friendly and fast. It's defiantly worth a try. The Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna is amazing as well other unique rolls. They also have a great selection of non-sushi items."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent. Not a place I would probably choose and/or recomend to anyone, but you may have a different take on the place."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite sushi place in Vegas! The price may be a bit more than others, but it's worth it. The quality of their fish along with great staff creates the best sushi experience that I've ever had. I've been to many sushi restaurants around Vegas, and no other places top this one. I highly recommend to give Sushi Bomb a try!"}
{"text":"Out of al sushi restaurants in my area, this is the place I frequently go to. Since, it isn't a large restaurant there is usually a wait, but not long at all. The quality of the sushi is good and they have a good variety of choices. The crispy rice topped with spicy tuna is always good. I've been here for lunch and dinner and always done the ayce. The service is quick, even when it's busy. It's a great neighborhood sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Best sushi around. High quality ingredients. Outstanding customer service. Hard to go other places."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. They speak english very well and i never have a problem with trying to converse with the workers. The dining area is always clean. after another table leaves, i tend to see how long it takes the workers to clean up after them and they're on it immediately. Love that! They have an awesome Mexican roll and Tiger roll that are to die for. Can't forget the miso soup!!! Best sushi place I've been to by far!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The service does suck. My friend and I walk in and no one greets us. We stand there for a few minutes and no one comes to seat us. We eventually ourselves at the bar and still nothing - not even the sushi chefs say hi. Are we ghosts? Eventually a waitress comes over with utensils but by that time my friend is done and we just leave.   Come on people, how do you expect to run a successful business this way? My god!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food is awesome and service was very professional. Will be back soon and bring my friends!!!"}
{"text":"It's been super busy every time I come in here but the service is attentive and quick. They don't take reservations on the weekends but the wait isn't too bad. Their snow rabbit and orange blossom is to die for. I come in here about once every 2 weeks but if I could I would come in every week!!! I've been to many ayce in vegas but sushi bomb has always been consistent in service and quality. I love their tempura banana split dessert."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because it's so close to my house. The verdict: I'll continue to drive across town to my usual, quality, sushi spot. Was disappointed in the fish which did not taste fresh & the service was just okay. One thing that really bothered me was after I got my check & I left the amount plus tip in cash-I wasn't even out the door when the server rushed to the table to make sure I paid. Cmon."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Great food, excellent service. Family of three tried all different items and each one was fantastic. Clam miso was great! Veggie tempura was awesome, and the blue fin, seared tuna and poke were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Been to several sushi places in town and this one is by far my favorite. We always do the AYCE and you have the majority of the menu as options. The variety is great and the service is fast."}
{"text":"actually really good sushi, they even had upon ramen. nice hidden gem. very friendly staff, can't wait to try more of their sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Writing this as my husband is throwing up his lovely dinner at this Venue. (Sarcasm when I say lovely) We used to love the food here and unfortunately it has declined along with the service. Did not eat some of our pieces of fish as it was below par yet told we would be charged. If you want side dishes those are still pretty good but if you are going for real sushi I would pass. I don't see how this place has such positive reviews with such low quality fish. Literally giving it two stars solely because of the appetizers."}
{"text":"This was some of the best and drag sushi I've ever eaten in Vegas. The miso soup is absolutely amazing would absolutely go back and I will be back! Great service as well!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch here with two friends. We each chose something different and we all enjoyed our selection. Service was good and the ambience was good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok I have known this place for a long time. All these people that are rating 5 stars have NEVER had good sushi because the fish is mushy. The service is great because there is no one there. The place sucks. This place is a horrible place. The next day I had a bomb."}
{"text":"Really great sushi!  Just wish there was more selections on the baked section of sushi."}
{"text":"This place has tasty sushi and chicken entree dishes. My husband and I got the sushi bomb specialty roll, and spicy chicken entree and both tasted delish. Service is excellent, and the staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the menu a la carte seemed pricey. I'm not one to get AYCE meals, so my only suggestion is to offer a HH for the a la carte patrons and that'd be perfect. All in all, my husband and I will be back and enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Every time I come into Sushi Bomb we have always had great, and timley service. Their spicy edemme is so yummy, and the sushi rolls are by far the best in town. I also like how close it is to my house. :)"}
{"text":"Love that there's a decent sushi spot so close to my house! I've always had a positive experience at sushi bomb!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this AYCE lunch special- $21 each before 3 PM- because this place is very close to where we live. The seating area is very small, but wasn't crowded, which was nice. The walls inside were painted with large fish and the decor was all cohesive. Now for the food!  We ordered an order of seaweed salad, veggie tempura, and calamari tempura. All were good.  For rolls, I ordered a Monster roll, a Snow Rabbit, and something else with lots of eel. I can't remember the name! My girlfriend started off with one order of some roll comprised of deep fried banana, sweet potato, and crunchy onions. We stopped there for rolls because we aren't great at AYCE sushi just yet.   After we finished our rolls, we ordered dessert. I got tempura red bean icecream and she got honey toast! Both were quite larger than I was expecting and the tempura icecream really hit the spot for me.   I added everything up and if we were going a la carte, we'd have spent a little more than double what we paid in the end.  Good servers, and a good option outside of Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Food 2 stars - their deep fried rolls are soggy Service 0 star - the guy taking our order stopped me half way thru taking my order to go pour tea for another table. What I love the most is that I ordered 3 rolls and they gave me 1 pack of soy sauce and NO WASABI!!!!! WTF!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Server asked if cust wanted table or bar customer asked table and he said well there only two of you go to bar.  What the hell???? I can tell service will.suck!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We finally stopped going after our last visit in early July 2013. We went in for lunch, ayce as we usually do and have done some 50-60 visits since 2010.  One of you younger sushi chefts, usually very unfriendly and sarcastic, refused to make us the last item we ordered.  When we inquired, he said he was too busy.  There were only two other sets of customers in the entire place.  While we enjoyed some of the items they made, there are much better and less costly places nearby.  This place is totally lacking in customer service, especially when you have customers such as us that had been frequented the place so much.  Obviously the owner does not care as I have never seen any replies to any type of bad review.  We just decided to not give our business to someone that does not appreciate it.  We now enjoy a much better setting with better food at less price, and the owner and employees appreciate the business every time."}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb is AWESOME!!  Fresh Fresh Fresh!!  Friendly staff!!  Recommend to EVERYONE!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years.  Never disappoints.  Always good.  Very fresh sushi, great service!  Usually gets busy at night.  Take out is done well too."}
{"text":"good quality fish and awesome atmosphere! our server's name was Sung In  and he was very friendly."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great sushi, definitely give this place a try!  The menu is extensive, the food is delicious, and the wait staff for most part is friendly, but the best part...it's all you can eat.  We eat there more often than we should (at least once per week),  but it's hard to resist, and we've never had a bad experience.  I would recommend lunch or an early dinner visit, because the restaurant fills up quickly, and you may have to wait a bit to place another order if you are doing all you can eat."}
{"text":"New to the city and tried several sushi places and by far Sushi Bomb on top of my list. Food, service and staff are excellent.  Definitely coming back and may be my spot for sushi and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was seated at the sushi bar and I tried the \"Tonight\" roll and it is one of the best rolls I have had in a while.came out quickly and I ordered it again.  I also had the white tuna 2 piece, salmon 2 piece and tuna 2 pieces they came out about average thickness compared to the other local places. The fish taste fresh and was not served with a hand full of rice   I used the restroom which was well maintained and clean the service was good I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is casual. The waitstaff friendly. The food is very good, and tastes pretty darn fresh. This isn't the coast, after all. But I have been to Sushi Bomb several times and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"If I could give Sushi Bomb 10 Stars I would !!! This place has NEVER gone downhill like EVERY OTHER sushi place in town. Always quality fish ... fresh fresh fresh !!! Our server Jennifer is the \"bomb baby !!\" If I had a restaurant I'd steal her !! My favorites ?? Dancing Spider for appetizer. Omg the best. My hubby and I order several different types of sushi and they bring it out on one large platter. That's the way to go if you don't want to be overstuffed. The fish v rice portions are perfect. Get the sushi bomb roll to seal the deal. My forever favorite sushi restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for several years now and every time, the quality of the sushi improves. It has easily become my favorite all you can eat sushi option. They offer more than sushi if you have those silly friends who don't eat it and now with the half roll option, you get to try even more! They lose a star because quite honestly, if it wasn't for their hard working helper John, who kicks ass and makes up for most of their shortcomings, their service isn't fabulous. A little slow and not always friendly.... but the food is great and worth a slightly curt server."}
{"text":"This place has alright sushi. Eh... I've had better... The only roll I liked was the dancing eel roll. Calamari had no taste I would say the same for the chicken karaa-ge."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for a Sunday dinner service. Family of 4 including 2 young kids. The ambience is average and the place is a little more than average noise level.   After being seated, a server came over to ask for drink orders. When I paused to breathe, she took that as taking too long and walked away. This actually happened a second time as I was asking my kids what they wanted and that took too long for her. On her third arrival at the table, I literally had to ask her to give us 30 seconds to answer her questions before she walks away again.   So we ordered 2 kids meals and 2 AYCE. The server  was at least helpful in explaining how their AYCE works e.g. which items were excluded or limited to one.   I found it a little off-putting to have her emphasize to us the kids can't share our food. This was as they were dropping food off to the table and the kids meals still waiting to be done. I totally get that a business doesn't want to have people abuse the AYCE rules, but I highly doubt 2 little kids are going to eat them into bankruptcy.   Then I ordered one thing only to have the wrong item brought to the table. When it was mentioned to the server, he shrugged his shoulders and left it on the table anyway.   When asked to speak with a manager, surprisingly none on site! Can't say that I didn't see that one coming.   It's a shame because the food is good and there is a decent selection. They do seem to err on more spicy oriented special rolls. Which is how they got a second star from me.   Definitely not very family friendly in my opinion. So won't be back. I recommend you save yourself a bad experience like we had and it spoiled a nice time out with my family."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town. The fish is always fresh and the service from Jennifer is always on par.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the friendly staff at Sushi Bomb, always giving excellent and expedited service. I love the combination bento's and fine other dishes.  Easy to locate off the 215 and Cheyenne and lots of parking.  Nice décor too."}
{"text":"We had 2 amazing experiences here and we loved most of the things we tried but the service and \"policies\" aren't in favor of the customer. You cannot upgrade your a la carte item to all you can eat...even if it's on the menu as an all you can eat option. They charge for tiny amounts of leftover food, even though it wasn't prepared properly. Such a bummer because the fish is fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible sushi!..the sushi bomb roll was hands down the best! Service was good and atmosphere was nice. We will make this our weekly Tuesday date night spot"}
{"text":"All you can eat ! 27$  Good food / fresh / Clean / food come quick.  I love Oyster  ( Big and Fresh )"}
{"text":"Have been hitting the sushi Places a bit lately.. I have to say this place was pretty good and had a varied menu of stuff with some really good spicy options. It didnt blow me away but was above average for sure. I would recommend for a good"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great service. Great food. The screaming O salad and the crazy jalapeño are my favorite. The Mohave beach roll was really good too!!! It's a bit small inside. But that's okay."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Everything tasted really good and the food kept coming.  I will be back next time I am in Vegas.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Its my first time in this sushi place they got a good and fresh sushi they treated us like a regular staff are nice And the dessets are awsome... I am will rilly gonna come back to this place :-) :-) :-)"}
{"text":"Visited this sushi restaurant this evening and half way through our meal we noticed the chefs was not wearing any gloves ir skin protection he continue to wipe his forehead, nose and sneezing, then proceeded to check the sharpness of his knife i was applauded and sickened after this moment, their all you can eat was very limited and services was sluggish. the chef was watching more tv game then preparing the food he continue to use his bare hands to push up the bridge of his glasses and wiping his nose right at the bar..ugh first visit.. last visit"}
{"text":"Cozy little sushi joint with great decor and friendly staff. The wooden wall gives an added ambiance to enjoy your dining experience. Yummy sushi to make my tummy happy AND so close to home for an added home run!"}
{"text":"by far the rudest staff and most unprofessional service. would never recommend this to a friend I wanted to keep."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Sushi Bomb for lunch. I ordered AYCE at the lunch special price of $20.95 ($6 savings from the dinner price).   I definitely treated myself and ordered a ton of food! I had to start with edamame, shrimp tempura, and miso soup.  I ordered about 4 rolls too, but my favorite was the Monster roll! The flavors were perfect!   The service is decent, and the staff is usually always friendly.   For dessert, I prefer the fried green tea I've cream or plain green tea. So delicious!   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here expecting a great dinner, instead I am burdened by nausea and disappointment. Crowded dining conditions, rude waiters and waitresses, sushi tasted like straight up ass."}
{"text":"Yet another soulless Korean pseudo sushi disaster trying to act like an authentic Sushi restaurant. Food: Below average, lots of stupid sounding mayo & fried food filled garbage advertised as specialty rolls. The actual fish sushi like Hamachi, Tuna, Albacore is cut so paper thin it looks like deli meat. the rice is dry, cold & tasteless.   The service was horrible, unfortunately we were a group of 7 and they automatically charge gratuitiy for parties of 5 or more. So obviously the staff already knowing their getting their tip are very rude and indifferent. I really resisted the urge of throwing our waiter through the window, he was a cocky, unpleasant, rude little punk with an attitude problem & acted like he was doing us a favor by serving us.   With all the amazing sushi places here in Las Vegas, I suggest you avoid this place unless you have low expectations for quality of food and a high tolerance for poor service."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for lunch. It was pretty slow and they seated us quickly. The hostess didn't seem all that enthusiastic to be there, but did her job. We didn't feel pressured, but we did both order the all you can eat and were aware of the 50 minute time. The menu changed a bit since the last time we were here and they altered a few names so ordering with a little confusing. The menu change seems like they added a lot of new items, which is great. Our orders came out pretty quickly, but we should have taken advantage of the half order rolls at the end since we were stuffed and felt pressure to clean our plates (our fault for ordering a bunch at once). Our favorites were the crunchy rice with salmon, Wild West, super white, tuna poke, monkey brains, and Mojave beach roll. The worst was the New Mexican roll, the habanero sauce was good and super spicy, but such an odd flavoring with the cilantro. We had mochi ice cream (coffee and cookies and cream), which were delicious even though we were so stuffed! Lunch was $21."}
{"text":"Love sushi bomb!!! Food is so good and cooks are fast every time!! Great service! One of the bet sushi places on my side of town! :) yum!"}
{"text":"The rolls that we received were delicious but the nigiri were a little on the small side. Biggest complaint of our dinner was when we asked for the \"daily special\" called stuffed tomato they said they were out of it. When we asked what they were out of they then said they weren't making this roll anymore tonight, and this was 45 minutes before closing. At this time we also noticed the sushi chefs putting the fish away and cleaning up their stations as well as the waitresses and hostess putting their jackets on and getting ready to leave. We were very uncomfortable and felt almost forced to leave even though they weren't closing yet. We enjoy sushi on a regular basis and there are closer places to our house, so we will not be going out of our way to go there again."}
{"text":"Great service!,Variety of rolls,fresh and tasty. Banana roll is definitely different but good. Mexican roll with a touch of Habanero is goodSpicy!!but gets your taste buds going. I enjoyed all food. All you can eat can't beat the deal.!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!! I love their sashimi plate! Very fresh and tasty fish and sauce. I'm sure this place is the best for Japanese cuision!! Nice service as well! Recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my family and I's go-to sushi place!! Service is ok but the yummy sushi and bento boxes make up for it! The prices are a bit high for some of the specialty rolls but it's pretty typical everywhere else. I have done their ACYE once but definitely do it when you don't have your kids with you because they don't want you to share or take home any of it. So basically come hungry if you're doing ACYE so you can get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"I used to recommend this place to all my friends...not anymore. Only one waitress for a busy Wed night and the 2nd waitress that was in \"training\" was not helpful...did not bring my friend miso soup (said \"sorry, I'm training\"..as she dropped off our sake). We later saw her deliver salad to the couple next to us. They used to have a Korean Lasagna and ?Volcano roll.  Not on the menu anymore...probably too much work or $$, but the sushi chefs that were there when it was a menu item, were there that night.  If you are a \"repeat\" customer. you should make an effort to retain that customer. They still have the \"ingredients\"...      It really is fresh sushi here... the blue fin tuna was so delicious!  The mgmt just needs to come help the lone waitress...."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is always good no matter what time of day.  The all-you-can-eat is the best way to go! Make sure you ask for a Paul,  he's always look out for his customers and makes great recommendations."}
{"text":"Really great, fresh food. Generous servings. Reasonable prices. The all you can eat deal rocks. Best sushi I've had in a long time. Golden Dragon roll, DJs special, salmon teriyaki all fresh and really tasty. Sunomono the best. And desert - honey toast?  Genius. So simple. Ice cream on honey drizzled toasted bread. How could I have not thought of this?  Came away with a very happy tummy. Strip mall alert!  Don't let the location deter you."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night for a party of three people. We were seated pretty quickly and had drink orders taken. The menu here is quite diverse, which I find to be pretty important when having AYCE sushi. Their rolls aren't all some variation of California rolls either.   I took off one star because a few of the menu items are extremely limited, such as \"one order per person\"..and that's total. I've heard of one order per round, but not per person. Will this prevent me from coming back? No. The fish tasted fresh and the presentation was great. Customer service was good, but not the best...Though i've come to lower my expectations for customer service at sushi restaurants. Overall, good quality food."}
{"text":"Helpful tip: when you offer all you can eat for lunch, then we proceed to eat all we can eat, don't get a pissed off holier than thou attitude and then make snide comments about how much we are eating. We were one of two parties in the restaurant, so I guarantee your job wasn't that effing difficult while we were there. Horrible service, and horrible food. Sushi bomb is simply an explosion of attitude and disappointment."}
{"text":"Always loved how their food always tasted fresh...they have a new menu. They kept my favorite roll, DJ Special. I am hoping they did not change their standards and just expanded their menu. AYCE is still available...more reviews to come."}
{"text":"This is our regular sushi place. They have a great selection of sushi rolls as well as some unique twists (my favorite is the Crispy Banana - a tempura fried banana with spicy tuna). The service isn't always the fastest but for $27 it's hard to beat the AYCE dinner if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in town. The prices are reasonable and the environment is fresh and contemporary. The service is great. Our favorite roll is ode de toilet, careful though! its really spicy."}
{"text":"This all you can eat sushi place has pretty fresh fish and the sushi is not overwhelmed by a large amount of rice.  Tucked away in a strip mall a little north of Summerlin, the location is ideal but the parking is somewhat limited as it is located right next to a martial arts studio.  The fresh shrimp and sea urchin sushi are pretty good (which is the telltale sign of the freshness of the fish).  Great service.  Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is not your typical grocery store bought California roll. This place is definitely on my sushi list. Of course they have ALLYOUCANEAT at $19.95!! I'd say what a steal! The reason why it's on my list is cus 1: they have my Cajun albacore and 2: they don't put too much rice in the rolls. Which means it's definitely quality taste. Best of all, the service is consistently efficient.   My favorite roll here is the warm springs roll. And don't forget to save room for their deep fried tempura ice cream. May I suggest trying it in plum flavor :)"}
{"text":"Andy is amazing! He creates amazing masterpieces and always goes above n beyond for his customers! This place has top notch food n friendly staff. I love love love this place. Always my first choice."}
{"text":"My co worker and I go here often. Prices are reasonable! Good food and service!  Highly recommend it!! Lunch specials are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Someone fire that Asian guy who runs the front of the house.  Terrible server who gets too comfortable with his customers.  Sushi bomb DOES NOT know how to handle big parties.   They purposely \"forget\" rolls.    It was an embarrassment bringing visitors here.  Do not come here."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer at Sushi Bomb and have always had a good experience. I usually get the AYCE and have ordered the tempura udon several times and I have always gotten a full sizes bowl with a separate plate of tempura. However, this time I was given a small bowl with little noodles and the tempura thrown in. The coating fell off the vegetables and shrimp and into my soup :( I don't know what changed from my last visit, but, it did put a damper on my experience."}
{"text":"Only 1 visit but so far so good. I went on a Saturday night, family of four. We all had AYCE and for the most part we enjoyed every roll. My favorite was the Angry Dragon. Seafood was fresh, everything was well prepared and presented. Service would be the only black mark. It wasn't busy, but had it been I'd be concerned because there was only one waitress. AYCE was $21 each which is fine IMO. Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"For the price of $21, the all you can eat lunch sushi was pretty awesome. The portions of the nigiri are a bit smaller but it is an all you can eat!   Nothing crazy sets place apart but it is still good and worth while!"}
{"text":"Not that happy with their bento and sushi. Took long for my order because they forgot my order and when I finally got my order the meat was tough.....I've had better"}
{"text":"Ill give this place 5 stars. The food here is on point. Def hit up the all you can eat. I love sushi cause thats what i grew up on and Ive had some bomb sushi and this place def has some decent sushi. I have my all time favorite spot but being that this is closer to my place i usually go here haha The staff is friendly and fairly fast with the service. Its a very small place but if you dont mind the wait im sure you wont be disappointed. The all you can eat sushi is worth the price. If you were to do the ala cart, by the time youve ordered 3-4 different things youde already have paid the price for the all you can eat. It would be nice if they did have a bigger seating area as they do get busy. But lts worth the wait."}
{"text":"Got some take out from here the other night.  Pretty decent and made it last for two nights.  I know, I know, some people saw not to do that with sushi.  But so far I have never had a problem!  I feel like I am getting more for my money too ;)    I do agree that too many of the rolls are very Americanized.   Cream cheese here and cream sauce there.  Deep fried this crunchy that.  I like sashimi and vegetables in my rolls.   I ordered salmon sashimi and two rolls.  The sashimi was great-just like butter.  The spicy tuna was good-not too spicy thank goodness.  The Wild Wild west have cream cheese in it but I still found it to be quite tasty.   I probably be back, its right by my neighborhood market, but it won't be my regular place."}
{"text":"Great service, good nigiri, below average sushi. I wouldn't come back, nor recommend this restaurant. There are too many great places on Spring Mountain for me to ever come back."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California with some friends when we came across Sushi Bomb. The food was absolutely delicious and our waiter, John, was the best! He was very nice and attentive. He made us feel welcomed. Would definitely go back for the great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of AYCE(all you can eat).  The sushi and sashimi was really fresh when I went.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Seating is a little crowded after 5pm but worth it.  Appetizers are creative and delish.  I'm in love with their buffalo shrimp tempura.  Yellow tail and salmon collar bone.  A Citrus sorbet.  Must try!    Eat greedy, yours truly -Mizz Loveli"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EXPLAINED: I was in the area, so I tried Sushi Bomb for a second time (first time did not go well either) with friends and our kids.  Major disappointment. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! Their AYCE sushi was a little pricey but it was Sunday late afternoon, and we knew the AYCE dinner price was still a value. The kids meal also seemed like a good value. NOTE: Hot green tea was NOT included for $27.99 per AYCE adult sushi which seemed strange to me. We were told right away to order ALL of our sushi at once because they would NOT otherwise be able to make it without us waiting up to 25 minutes for each order... WHAT? That is NOT how \"All You Can Eat\" is supposed to work. We all felt cheated because of the time delay between our ordering and receiving our food. This needs to be fixed Sushi Bomb! Hire more sushi chefs and servers (there must have been around 75 people in this little restaurant and it looked like only THREE servers). THEN THEY GOT OUR ORDER WRONG, forgot items (I never did get my blue fin tuna nigiri), had to replace items with other choices (even though the fish we wanted was an advertised item on the table display), served us COLD HOT GREEN TEA (which took over 10 minutes to get replaced) they mistakenly put my last specialty roll on another table so I had to WAIT LONGER to get it after they tried to influence me to cancel the order (as we were at the end of our dinner)... The food quality was okay UNTIL THEY SERVED THE GOLDEN SCALLOPS, which WERE NOT EVEN SCALLOPS AT ALL!! The \"Golden Scallops\" were made with FAKE CRAB MEAT (they later admitted to us that it was fish cake, but I know what the imitation crab meat looks and tastes like), which were OVER-BREADED in a flavorless, over-fried very hard coating... YUCK!!! Gross!!! We asked for a discount as our check for this experience was almost $200 for 3 adults and 3 kids, and were only given ONLY $12 off... why that amount, I could not tell you, but we agreed that at least it was some amount taken off of the check.  I will NEVER RETURN to Sushi Bomb. I did not enjoy it. We finally paid and left, but this bad experience was not over yet...  After all of this, I unfortunately felt victimized by Sushi Bomb as they squeezed in SO MANY TABLES in that place that I could not walk through to the exit without knocking stuff off of one of their tables... which is HUMILIATING and MUST BE A FIRE HAZARD!!! (I wish I had taken pictures to post, but I did not... if so you could see the \"Golden Scallops\" horror... )"}
{"text":"Just recently went there and got to explore the menu a little. These special rolls were conquered!  This Guy- *****- The soft shell crab combo is EXCELLENT! Stuffed Tomatoes- ***- A bit sloppy but the salmon was good. not too much flavor though. Sex on the Beach-****- nice spicy kick to it! S & H Special-*****- Most exotic roll I've tasted"}
{"text":"As all you can eat sushi goes this place is great. Often the service is slower than it should be, but the food comes quickly once you order and is exactly what you'd expect. FYI - there is one roll that comes with a heat warning, both on the menu and a verbal from the staff. The warning was something we should Have heeded"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas. A great get away a hidden treasure for sure. If you are staying at red rock you are very close. The sushi was amazing some unique dishes that I have never seen before. I came away with a full belly and not an empty purse."}
{"text":"Best sushi place around my area, recently got a new menu with all kinds of good stuff.   They got rid of all you can drink though which was a huge disappointment as it was our #1 draw to go to this specific sushi joint. May have to find a new one with a similar deal if it does not return. If it was because it was too cheap, I would easily still do it for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places in Vegas! The sushi is such quality and the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"ALWAYS have such a great experience at Sushi Bomb. There aren't many sushi locations in this area and this one is top notch. I would come here even if I didn't live in the area! All of their fish is fresh and delicious. The customer service is amazing. I love when a 1HR AYCE place actually is attentive so you don't have to order everything at once because they will always be around to check up on you!"}
{"text":"I've been to some sushi spots in town and I have to say this one is my favorite. This is my go to sushi spot, i love coming here."}
{"text":"Sushi bomb is my favorite!!!! The staff here is incredible. The happy hour here is awesome too! Check this place out."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot on the north side of Vegas!!! Service is great and quality is awesome!!! Can't go wrong with AYCE when the choices are so BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in my area. Always get the ayce as it's the best value. Love the rainbow rolls and spicy tuna rolls. Waiters and waitresses are friendly. Great service"}
{"text":"What happened Sushi Bomb? This used to be a great place years ago, but ever since new management took over, it has not been the same.   So, the waitress had no personality and looked pretty annoyed while taking our orders. She was seriously so SLOW. My boyfriend and I didn't even get offered any drinks or a menu until about 10-15 minutes after we sat down with my family.   Some of their specialty rolls like the Touchdown was good. Their eel sauce as part of the DJ's Special (one of my favorite rolls) seriously tasted like cinnamon was way too sweet for me. I was a little bummed.  Overall, they need to fix their customer service, timing and definitely try to be more attentive to their guests."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot in the North West Valley. Everything is always fresh. They do get busy, but they handle it well and make sure everyone is taken care of. My favorite is the spicy Tuna roll. The spicy edemame is the best too.   Must go!"}
{"text":"This place used to be \"the bomb\", but I am not sure if ownership changed because primarily customer service is rude and the food kind of sucks. I used to almost on a weekly basis order a shrimp tempura roll and gladly pay the ten bux for that one roll because it was so satisfying. The last few times I have gone, stuff has tasted weird and I get the skinniest rolls with almost no topping on them. I am really bummed becasue it is right up the street from me, but I don't care to spend my money or time getting mediocre food and service. The chefs used to be so friendly and now they seem annoyed which really affects food quality"}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb has a wide variety of specialty rolls that I have never heard of before!  We ordered AYCE for lunch, which was about $22 per person.  Our server warned us in advance that any leftovers would be charged at regular price...although this is a rule we are aware of, I've never been verbally told about it.    I'm pretty picky with sushi, but surprisingly I loved one roll that I would never have ordered on my own.  I believe it was called The Hulk, which contains soft shell crab and some sort of yummy sauce.  In the end- the food was tasty, we were stuffed and the service was good."}
{"text":"This place is fiyaaaaa. You haven't had bomb sushi until you've had sushi bomb, ya feel? Believe me fam, they lit like the Fourth of July. You can cash me ousside they door, how bow dah. YASSSSSS GAWD."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi place. The food is ok but the staff is so lame. Can't even take the order right. They have to learn how to speak English and take orders correctly. They defenetly bombed out."}
{"text":"Best sushi! The fish is super fresh and high quality. AYCE is worth the price. $27 for dinner. Also good  menu selection for those who don't eat sushi. The bentos are delicious! Fun atmosphere. Always clean inside and the staff is really nice. Kyle is our favorite! Hands down one of the best places I've eaten at. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We ordered AYCE and it was totally worth it. We ordered a ton of rolls, appetizers, soup, desserts -- sushi bomb roll, wild wild west, rainbow roll, tuna lovers, salmon cheese stick, gyoza, spicy garlic edamame, crispy rice with spicy tuna, blue fin tuna sashimi, beef udon, mochi, tempura banana split. All of it was delicious and the service was great! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had in LV... but still have a few more places to try. We go here weekly.   You must try: Rabbit Pearl, X-girlfriend, Touchdown 2 & Rock N Roll   Always awesome sushi, service can be slow at times but most of the time it is on point and friendly. AYCE is a must and they have AYD (All you can drink beer) for cheap too.   Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I think I might have found my new favorite Sushi spot! It's a hidden Jem, It's small, but nicely decorated.   Now for the best part the sushi... So good! Our favorite roll was the Baked Salmon & the Shrimp Tempura Roll. The Salmon literally melts in your mouth and it's the best feeling ever. I love Shrimp so I had to get the Shrimp Tempura Roll and I wasn't disappointed I loved it.   I cannot wait to come back here again & try out some more rolls. Honestly the best and the tastiest place ever."}
{"text":"What can I say the place was amazing and the food was delicious. I forgot the guys name, but I know he was Vietnamese ( our server ) he was very fast getting our order and bringing us our food. We were a table of 11 and two baby and he took good care of us. We did all you can eat and by the end I was so happy and full! Definitely we all will come back again! Thanks to my lil brother now I know another great place to eat sushi !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Loved their spicy edamame. And the rest of the sushi was super fresh"}
{"text":"Me and my bf are sushi fanatics and LOVE to find new low key places. Came across this place on yelp and knew I had to check it out! So after class on a Thursday, around 10p, we decided to give this place a shot.  Located around at Cheyenne and 215. It was quiet when we arrived, only 2 other girls at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs and a server on duty. Everyone was really nice. They recommended the S&H Roll and we also ordered the Kimono Roll. Both of which are cream cheese rolls so it's kinda heavy, but DELICIOUS!! Comes with a little salad with their dressing in the center. Just hit the spot.  Also tried their yellowtail roll and scallop sushi. Scallops were big but not too fresh (I usually only get them when I am in Cali) and the yellowtail was okay, not really a fan.  What I am a fan of is their dessert! They have plum flavored ice cream! (Photo added) we had plum tempura ice cream. YUM! There's chunks of plum in the ice cream.   Service was awesome, food was great, ambiance was nice, good location for me. Great place. Must check it out.  I plan to return regularly when I am not dieting :)"}
{"text":"We've been customers of Sushi Bomb since day one - so I can't believe I haven't written a review!  This is our convenient go-to neighborhood sushi joint - perfect for after work noshing without having to drive too far. Although, like everything else in Vegas, it's in a suburban strip mall - the interior is well done - with wood paneled walls with large paintings of koi and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The glass tiled wall behind the sushi bar gives it a bit of hip chic.  We've always felt the food is good here. Sure - the waitress will always make the obligatory joke when you ask for a \"Kiss My Ass\" roll - and like so many sushi bars in town, everything has a somewhat dirty name. I have to admit, I don't find this trend particularly appealing, but whatev.  Last night the two of us split the aforementioned Kiss My Ass, the Red Tiger roll, Veggie Roll, and garlic tuna nigiri chased down with a house saki and a large Kirin. A new roll for us, The Red Tiger, is shrimp tempura and avocado wrapped in spicy tuna with a garlic sauce which is amazing. A new favorite. We don't do the AYCE because it isn't worth it for us - we can't eat that much!   Service was peppy and good as usual. Sometimes they can get a little spacey during a rush - but it's a cute spacey."}
{"text":"We came to Sushi Bomb at 2:30 pm for AYCE, not knowing that lunch pricing cuts off at 3:00pm. Luckily the server was very accommodating and allowed us to pay the lunch price, as long as we finished putting in our order by the cut-off.   There is a great selection of AYCE menu items including appetizers, entrees, and desserts. It's $21 for AYCE lunch and $27 for dinner (kids are cheaper), and you will definitely get your money's worth.   As far as sushi quality goes, everything was good. The unagi, ahi, hamachi and smoked salmon nigiri were delicious. Rolls are big and if you're placing your last order they allow half orders. We tried the 007, Snow Rabbit, White House, and the DJ.   All of that sushi plus side orders of chicken karaage, ika tempura, gyoza, and zaru soba left my boyfriend and I very VERY full.   Service was prompt and our server was helpful and polite. Sushi Bomb is a great option for sushi in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. Thanks to their all you can eat special I was able to try out several different rolls and enjoyed them all. I was also impressed by how fast the service was since the place was a bit busy at the time. I would definitely recommend going here if you are in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not really a sushi fan, but everyone I know is. That being said, everyone I've brought here loves it! I always get the shrimp tempura, and the Yagozi dumplings (fried, not steamed), and finish it with their mochi ice cream. But the thing I CRAVE from here is their strawberry Nigori, it's so sweet it's like a sake milk shake."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi! I came here at 11pm on a Friday night.  The uni, hamachi and red snapper were all fresh. They had kanpachi on the menu but they ran out, unfortunately. The appetizer list was a bit short but good quality.    The only thing that I didn't like was that they added too much rice on the nigiri."}
{"text":"Still loving this freakin place.  Honestly when you really take a look at the reviews- the only reason it doesn't have a better overall rating is because of the service.  The sushi is SO good though!  The spicy garlic edamame, the S & H special, their sashimi... just amazing.  And really.. the service has never been a problem for me.  Really, give this place a try. :)"}
{"text":"I have lived in the neighborhood by Sushi Bomb for 3 years and I'm so mad at myself that I've just now gone for the first time! It is incredible. We had the coconut lovers roll and the original sushi bomb roll. Both were to die for! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb!!!   My husband took me here a year ago for the 1st time.  It is not close to our home, but VERY worth the drive.  We have visited a few sushi bars here in Vegas, and By Far, Sushi Bomb is the BOMB!  I love the all you can eat, they offer new suggestions and the quality is superb!  The staff is attentive, and very friendly! We have gone to Sushi Bomb a few times and they will always be our 1st choice for a great Japanese meal!  Yummi....I may just go again this weekend!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want the following:   1. FORGET YOUR ORDERS  2. FORGET  REFILLS 3. DIRTYNESS  4. RUDENESS"}
{"text":"First time to visit from out of town  The moment we walked in restaurant did not feel very welcoming . Waitress seem rushed so it made our lunch very rushed and not enjoyable . I usually like to walk into restaurant to enjoy my meal with my company and have a pleasant lunch .  Was not very pleasant nor comfortable . My expectation ordering a hot miso soup  is to have it served hot.   Hot water I ordered was like warm  Not very pleased with this restaurant and will not recommend to business partners, friends or relatives to pick this place as a first choice. Would think twice before I ever come to this place"}
{"text":"This place was da bomb. Wife and I came here to eat and watch the golden knights play. The ayce is great cause after a couple rolls it pays for itself. Also comes with a dessert loved the fried banana split. Definitely will be back. Hint if coming for dinner get there early it fills up quick."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas! Great AYCE deal, fresh ingredients, awesome decor, friendly staff. LOVE everything about this place. I would give it 10 stars if possible. I am now a loyal Sushi Bomber!"}
{"text":"Try the sushi bomb angry dragon. Delicious! $21 for unlimited sushi. The place is clean and the service is good."}
{"text":"Good selection with the rolls and price is competitively good. Great service from the staff especially John, he is on top of it and making our experience very enjoyable. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Sushi was OK but the service was terrible. Me and my group were rushed to order, hostess was extremely rude, and had to wait 10 minutes before we even got our service. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food, fabulous service!  So much to choose from. Even for the non-fish eater like me!  We had 6 of us for dinner last night and everyone loved it!  Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free saki or beer!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite all you can eat sushi spot. The food is always consistent, unlike other places that are not always fresh. They also have unique rolls that other spots don't have. Unfortunately, I live in Henderson and it's on the opposite side of town."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi today and to my surprise this place was right around the corner from. It's a nice place, very nice atmosphere and vibe. I sat at the bar, food was made quick and was very good. I had their \"Red Rock chief special roll\", two of them."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and got the Japanese lasagna roll. It was pretty good, but not memorable. I also got the crab miso soup and it had a lot of crab meat in it which I can appreciate. Some places just don't add a lot of seafood to their dishes.   Ordering take out for sushi is always hit or miss and I'm a firm believer in sitting in the restaurant to eat Japanese. Nonetheless, I'll be going back some time real soon"}
{"text":"Pork Belly. You can order it from the AYCE menu and it is phenomenal. Yes, this is a sushi place and the sushi selection is terrific. However, the reason I rank Sushi Bomb ahead of the AYCE competition is the menu beyond the raw fish. Grilled Salmon collar, bacon wrapped scallop yakitori and the buttery corn dish come to mind. For desert I always go with the honey toast. Tucked away off Cheyenne, a bit north of Summerlin, Sushi Bomb is a bit of a hidden gem, yet it is well worth the journey for us Vegas Sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas! I used to go here twice a week when I lived on that side of town! Delicious, quality sushi & some really unique house rolls. Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad experience here. Prompt service and food. Great staff and the sushi chefs aretop notch. Tonight, everything was extremely fresh, well prepared, and tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Had better, but good enough and I like the idea of the all-you-can-eat. My 2 year old actually liked the food and she doesn't eat anything! Recommended."}
{"text":"Food here is good. Large pieces of fresh fish on the nigiri.  The rolls are good, maybe not as creative as some other places in town.  The big let down was the slow and poor service.  I would give the sushi 4 - 4.5 stars and the service 2-3"}
{"text":"Sushi is really good but service is very bad!!  I was waiting to get something to go and no one noticed me for like 10 minutes until they took my order. They are all over the place..didn't make me feel comfortable"}
{"text":"Ugh, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!  Me and a girlfriend would always come here for good sushi when Sushi Kaya down in Chinatown started to fall off (they've recovered) and Sushi Bomb was always so good! Something happened recently where they took a lot of the rolls I loved, off the menu. We would always go inside and eat for lunch or dinner. It was a hit or miss. The food was always on point which is great, but the service in there was always horrid. Sometimes we'd wait 15 minutes before our waters were refilled in a restaurant of only 3 small filled tables. Unacceptable  There was even a day when every single table was not bussed of the previous diner's dishes that we had no choice but to sit at the bar and then new customers wouldn't have anywhere to sit! It was gross being surrounded by plates and half eaten food.   So, I started getting it to go. The food was still good I just didn't want to deal with the in house situation. Well they've managed to disappoint me there too. It's always hard to order take out when the restaurant doesn't have a website or a current menu posted anywhere online. I always a specific roll and the past three times they've forgotten the sauce that goes on top. Last time they also forgot the ginger and wasabi. (which I actually use)   NOW, all that being said, I somehow still recommend it. They've expanded their menu a bit and have a lot of options besides just sushi. Good to take kids to, people that don't like raw fish, and good for groups. Maybe it's just the time I go, but it looks look a couple staff members may have changed. BUT if you do take out, I'd recommend that you tell them to keep your food in a fridge because they will leave it right at the register if you show up 15, 20, or 30 minutes after it's prepared. Raw fish+room temp= a big no no."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many AYCE sushi stops here in the Las Vegas metro, and I can say unequivocally that Sushi Bomb may be my new favorite, it's on the fast track.  Prices are compatible to others, and I feel the decor, speed and most importantly-the fresh taste of the fish make this one of the best values at the price point. I like that they offer a kids AYCE menu AND a separate kids entree menu so my four year old can find something she wants. One part of AYCE is that a lot of places, the rolls begin to taste very similar unless you stretch to the far corners of the menu.  Not do at Sushi Bomb, each roll had its own distinct flavor that did not disappoint.   I recommend the namesake roll, the Sushi Bomb as well as the White House roll.  My wife is a fan of the Coconut Lover. The service was quick and friendly. I will be back, I look forward to it"}
{"text":"BEST Sushi I have had in a VERY long time!!! Love the atmosphere as well. I would highly recommend going here :)"}
{"text":"Sushi bomb is the bomb place for sushi!! AYCE definitely recommended! Sashimi is very fresh!"}
{"text":"Big fan of sushi... When we decided to go here for ayce I had never heard of it.  We sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave us a piece of nigiri each... Good not great as tasted a little fishy. Then we shared a few rolls... The hulk, rabbit pearl and who love long time were really good (big fan spicy tuna or spicy rolls in general). He got the Mexican lasagna... It was good but I'm not a yum yum fan but he really liked it!  For $20 you are better off doing ayce than buying even two rolls for lunch! And sharing is perfect as get to taste more variety!  The service varied, she kept our glasses full and was good about bringing more ginger as we both really like it. The chef however seemed a little slow as 20 min later we had everything but one roll and he was kind of snippy saying its coming when we asked. But it was enjoyable And I would go back, especially to share sushi! Thanks for showing me a new place!"}
{"text":"Well, I USED to be obsessed with this place. I didn't come in for about a month and on my recent visit, everything was different. The menu changed and they took off a lot of my favorite rolls. Didn't seem like there were as many options as before.   The saddest part of my visit was that they no longer have the all you can drink draft beer as an add on for all you can eat.  To be honest that's one of the main reasons we would all come here, because who wants to pay $7 for ONE beer when you can pay $4.99 for all you can drink draft Sapporo?! Nobody, that's who!   Needless to say, I probably won't be frequenting this location anymore. There's plenty of other good sushi restaurants with cheaper AYCE and alcohol specials. Yes they're farther from my house but this place has lost its luster. If it was still the awesome Sushi Bomb I knew and loved, we would still all be going there!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I eat here at least once a month. We are both pretty picky about our sushi and love Sushi Bomb. We have eaten AYCE and a la carte and have always been happy. You can't beat all the yummy stuff that you can eat with their AYCE though, which is pretty much their full menu. Some of our favorites are the Coconut Lover roll, the pork belly, the green muscles and their Nigiri is always good. Their specials they have are always great and change often to always give you something new to try. You also get $3 Sapporo beers when you eat AYCE, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"20% off happy hour Monday through Thursday hooked me, because it is 9pm to midnight on all food. This place is fairly new and a hidden gem in the Wal-Mart Grocery shopping center (next to Lee's Liquor). I love the Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi and my fiance loves all the sake offerings on the menu. Service is great and speedy. A great local spot on this side of town that was needed. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ok so before I go on with this review, I need to tell you first that I am not too much into sushi except for your basic California rolls. With that said, what I always wanted to do was try ALL types of sushi. My reasoning is that why try different types and pay for each roll. What if I dont like that roll? So the best answer was to do an all you can eat! Pay one price and try everything! Well everything that you can eat anyway. I heard if you have leftovers they charge you. So my plan was to go with friends and team up!  So, this place has a buy 2 all you can eat, get one free! Split the bill three ways and you're set! They have this special I think starting at 9 pm. Call them for more details.  Now for the food. OMG! First of all, I didnt know there were lots of different sushi combinations and they all have different names. For this place you got sexual inuendos as names. How fitting for a sushi virgin. Names like sex on the beach, ex boyfriend/girlfriend, and 69 are just some of the options. Hay, im not making this up! I tried a lot of different rolls my friends ordered. Of course we were not able to order everything.   Service was good. I didnt have any thing out of the ordinary to complain about. We got what we ordered in a timely manner. Refills were constant. Our server answered all my questions quickly and even had some suggestions.   Everything I tried seemed really good. I didnt even bother trying to read what each individual roll consisted of. With the help of my friends, all the selections were really good. I think the next time I will be more assertive in picking my own rolls. For now, this experience was well worth it and I can take it off my bucket list.  So if you have any favorites or suggestions for me, (heck, even a recommendation for another sushi place is welcome so I can compare is fine with me) feel free to send me a message! Im still trying to get the hang of eating sushi! Thanks Sushi Bomb for being gentle!"}
{"text":"This place changed my thinking on AYCE! Their menu is pretty open for the AYC eater and service is pretty fast even when the place is packed. The sushi was pretty fresh and the rice was not dry. From appetizers, soups, salads, sushi, sashimi, rolls, noodles, skewers, it was totally available and they didn't hold back. They even have a AYCE price on their draft Sapporo, $3! With a price tag of $27 per adult AYCE, you cant beat it!"}
{"text":"One word... YUMMY! Awesomely unique rolls and super fresh sushi. The price? Comparable to other sushi restaurants. Highly recommend the S&H Special!  One tip: if ordering hot sake, ask them to heat it up more a bit. It's usually served more on the tepid side."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever! I'm from North Carolina and I visit Vegas a few times out of the year, Sushi Bomb is always a MUST when I come. All-you-can-eat is where it's at! EVERYTHING is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food Amazing  Service Great  But Paul Makes you feel at home!!!   Must try the Tonight roll and the LA BBQ ribs"}
{"text":"Best avocado rolls in town. Not a pound of rice like other places. Avocados always looking fresh. No browning here.  I give it four stars because the service is soooooo slow.  There were only 3 tables besides ours so I couldn't see the reason for the slow speed.  The food is good enough and prices are reasonable so it's worth it."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Paul and Jennifer I would honestly not come here! The food is delicious and this is by far my favorite ayce place! Although I almost stopped coming here cause the people were so rude to my family one time I came! But ever since I met Paul I continue to come only when he is here! He is the best server in this place and his partner Jennifer was amazing as well! Thanks Paul and Jennifer  for your great service I look forward to our next visit!!"}
{"text":"We had our hesitations about Sushi Bomb because of some of the 1 star reviews, and because we have our usual go-to sushi spots around Vegas that never disappoint. We moved to the NW side of town recently, and decided to give Sushi Bomb a try due to its proximity to our home-- and we couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised! The fish was not only fresh, but it's one of the few places in town that offer super white (my fave!) Our waiter was super friendly, and very helpful with the menu. He offered his opinion on some of their popular rolls, all of which were amazing. Even the dessert menu was unique and offered different options than what we are used to (I went for the deep friend banana split- DELICIOUS!) Great spot, great service, great experience. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi and service. The only negative thing is: their hot tea it's a little too weak for my taste."}
{"text":"I have introduced many people to Sushi Bomb and all leave saying the same thing. 'That was some of the best sushi I have had in awhile!' I go as often as I can. Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Great and yummy place to eat out with my kids!!!!  They love shirmp tempura and udon.  Good service and good food. great neighborhood eat out place!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat special.. Enjoyed a great lunch with my honey! The tiger roll and the late night roll (pretty sure that is the name)are awesome..sushi bomb is soooo bomb!!!! The Staff was very friendly and accommodating..we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Are you looking to gain unwanted pounds and WASTING your calories?  Are you DYING to be served by a nonchalant waitress who only fills up your drinks when you ask her to, plus bonus attitude?  Then you are in luck! Sushi Bomb is the place for you! Call NOW and secure a spot for your All You Can Eat RICE at only $19.95 for lunch.  That's right! You can have all the rice you want in your nigiri and rolls for only $19.95.  But WAIT! If you call in the next 10 minutes, they will even include unrecognizable soft shell crab all mushed up in your sushi rolls! What a deal!   That is all."}
{"text":"Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, I wanted to find a different place to eat sushi for evening other than my usual sushi bar.  Since this place is somewhat near our house, we stopped in for an early dinner.  The bar area is quite nice, overall decor very comforting and natural.  I loved the fact that the place was basically all ours for the hour we were there.  The menu is great--simple and with some great options done differently.  Their amaebi, for example, includes the deep fried fish heads along with the two pieces of sushi.  I personally love sucking on a few shrimp heads, because that's where all the flavor is.  It was great.  We ordered all the yakitori skewers, 4 types, and it came with 2 skewers each.  Thinking they were the small yakitori, we didn't think it would be a lot to order for dinner. Oh my.  These skewers are pretty big, so majority of our dinner were the appetizers.  It was great!  The sauce was yummy and the meats were cooked well.  As for the shrimp ones, I didn't eat the shrimp.  I feel that shrimp should ALWAYS be cleaned because that black line is poop, and I don't eat poop.  That was a no-no for me, and therefore a deduction of 1 star on my review.  As for the rest, we tried their sushi, all perfectly portioned and the fish was great.  Their sauces are very good at this restaurant, everything from their cucumber salad, tempura dip, to the sauce they put on their yellowtail.  Oh and their tempura is crispy and light, too.  We loved it.  I think this place, despite its location being right next to the 215 on W. Cheyenne, is a really good sushi bar.  We plan to go back this week to try the rest of the menu.  If you want a road trip within city limits, try this place.  I know that they serve the same special rolls as any other sushi bar, but their sauces and talent make for a great night.  Plus their website says that it's 20% off after 9pm to midnight.    Great sushi, excellent service, and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I would say that my family and I have frequented this establishment quite often over the past three years of living in Las Vegas. Anytime someone asks where we like to eat sushi, we always say here. We have had nothing but great service time and time again, until tonight. We wanted a seat for three, wait time was told 20-30 minutes- which was fine. They were busy, but we were first in line for a table. About 10 minutes later a woman and her child came in requesting specifically to sit at the bar because a table was going to take too long. Watching one couple finish their desert we knew our time was coming! (Yay!- right?!) waitress sat the woman and her child at our table. I asked and all I got was an \"I'm so sorry\" nothing. Nothing. Waited a few more minutes before deciding to get with two other strangers and share the six top that had been empty long before we walked in.   Once seated we ordered drinks and our first round of food. Everything was great until after we noticed our second round of plates were empty and we had nothing left to eat. 45 minutes later we finally received our plate of nigiri and last roll. Not once during our meal were we asked if we would like to order, if we needed more drinks or how everything was. I ended up talking them into only charging me for two all you can eat and one single roll since my sister ordered the one roll that took over an hour to make and didn't eat anything else nor did she want to order more after sitting at the table watching us eat for an hour.   $87 later and I'll be honest, I didn't leave a tip. This truly breaks my heart to have had this experience at our (previously) favorite sushi restaurant.   I've worked in the food industry before, and I think a little communication and organization such as sections for a specific server so they're not all tending to every table would do a long way.   Love,  Broke and still hungry."}
{"text":"The name speaks for itself. Been here twice and each time was great food and attentive service. We did the all you can eat which at some places can be more rice than anything, but this place rocks it with a ton of fish and the quality is amazing. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, ate their it's perfect. I eat to go a lot and it's also always the best to go ever. So neat, and very nice people."}
{"text":"Man this place used to be real good, the fish was fresh and the prices where reasonable.  Then the unthinkable happened, AYCE, NOOOOOO.  Well I wasn't in the mood gorge myself with rainbow rolls and I wanted to leave but Silvio wouldn't let me because we already sat down :)  So i ordered ala cart and my worst fear became a reality, the quality of the fish plummeted, the salmon nigiri tasted like albertsons salmon and the tuna was, well, ok I guess.    If they had the same quality fish as before and still had AYCE it would have been a frigging gold mine, but I digress, it is not.  I like sushi mon and this place seems comparable quality wise albeit 4 bucks more since to get the signature rolls there is an up-charge and not sure if you can order hot stuff off the menu with ayce.  The ala cart menu was reasonably priced however."}
{"text":"Came here for my wife's birthday. Had the AYCE Sushi. It was a Tuesday night, around 6pm. Wasn't too busy, there were open tables, but we chose to sit at the sushi bar. We each had three rolls. I had a Dragon Roll, LA BBQ Roll, and a specialty spicy tuna roll (I have forgotten the name.) All the rolls were very good and fresh. The AYCE wasn't too bad $27, and they had a lot of things that we didn't have room to try.   The staff are very attentive, we had multiple people willing to put our order in, checking on our drinks, and making suggestions on what we may like. I would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. Only gave 4 stars because it didn't blow me away, but it was definitely a very good place to visit."}
{"text":"I will NEVER bring my business here again- It was just me eating, unfortunately I !SOON! started to not feeling good in between rolls and had to excuse myself from the bar and immediately used the restroom- they charged me the all you can eat- plus a 10$ fee for not finishing my 1 roll-  even though I told them I felt ill - fuck y'all! Hope your business fails you no sympathy having, money grabbing, Jerks!!"}
{"text":"This place gets three stars for a great selection and an extra fourth for there AYCE&D.  They have a pretty good selection of rolls, always important to me.  A few issues: Not a fan of the 'orgasm sauce' they use there. It came on the rock n roll and the stuffed tomato (which everywhere I've had this they do not sauce this roll) There imitation crab tastes funny (maybe it was just me)  I really really enjoyed the angry dragon roll, perfect perfect sweet and spicy blend!  The bf had his usual chicken teriyaki and Sapporo which he said was very satisfying and well worth the price paid.  The rolls were not overly rice-y like some AYCE places; there was plenty of fish.   Overall the food was good and the service was decent. The price is great."}
{"text":"nothing special. sushi not super fresh. fried chicken was dry and bland. udon was decent. better than the other items, but about par to other japanese restaurants"}
{"text":"We moved to Vegas 5 months ago and have been trying every local place! We finally found a keeper! great service, bizarre for a sushi place. Garlic edamame was fantastic. Hulk roll and spicy tuna roll very good. Sushi Bomb roll is good if you like cream cheese."}
{"text":"Called to order food... woman could literally care less that I didn't know what to order. The website was no help either just titles with no specifics... they use to have great customer service but now that they have plenty of customers the customer service is out the window! We need a new sushi roll in the 89129 area."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  I highly recommend the Golden Dragon.  The Mexican Lasagna is also a great baked sushi."}
{"text":"Food is good however the \"AYCE RULES \" change from visit to visit and depending on your server the level of service will vary.  Honestly this is the two things that will drive my business away from this spot. Customer service is by far not one of their staffs strong suits."}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb has a great all you can eat lunch. Large selection. Everything we tried was perfectly prepared. They also have the non seafood lovers covered. Excellent panko crusted chicken. Service was timely and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of our new favorite sushi places in town.  All of the rolls we have had are delicious and the staff is always very friendly.  It is not the cheapest AYCE, but it is still very reasonable and worth the money.  They also had a great deal when we were there that for $4 extra on the AYCE it included all you can drink draft beer which worked out great to wash down all the tasty/spicy rolls :)"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Las Vegas' ayce sushi. I've seen some people talk about the quality of fish here, claiming that it's not fresh, or \"what can you expect, it's not on the coast?\" I haven't been to the coast yet,(hoping to soon) but it's really not THAT friggin' far. Any ways, I found the fish to be very fresh. The chefs used good cuts, and really seemed to know what they were doing. They had a lot of rolls that I haven't seen before, so I loved trying those out. The lasagna roll, I think it's called, was amazing. So was pretty much everything else I ordered. It definitely beats everything we had back in Atlanta. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi place, tucked in the mountains on the NW.  The variety of rolls and tempura was awesome and the staff were friendly. It was quite crowded, even on a Wednesday evening, because it is a small restaurant. But we opted to sit at the bar. Nice selection of saki, too. We chose the all you can eat but honestly, I could barely put down two rolls so it would've been more cost effective if I did a la carte. I would definitely recommend this place but I personally wouldn't go on a Friday or Saturday because of how busy it was even mid-week. If you like spicier rolls, go for the Red Rock. It was delicious but had some kick."}
{"text":"I go here every so often with my family. As a hardcore avocado roll fan, the quality of the avocado really matters and Sushi Bomb never fails with their avocado roll quality. The food is great. The ambience is amazing. The decorations on the walls are very nice as well. Not to mention how amazing the prices are. I also love their miso soup!  My only complaint is that every few visits, service is slow. It takes a while to be seated and there isn't always a host/hostess at the table (even if there are tons of visible empty tables). They don't seem to have too many people working there, but thankfully, I've never had to wait more than 5~10 minutes--it just seems like a long time when you see the empty tables and you are very hungry!  I definitely would keep coming here whenever I'm in the area. I recommend Sushi Bomb to anyone who appreciates quality food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to get sushi you should definitely go here! They have a wide variety of sushi to choose from and they are super quick with their service. Their fish always has tasted fresh and I would definitely recommend their no rice rolls as they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and food was very good! Definitely worth getting all you can eat to taste all the different rolls they have to offer. My husband also ordered the honey toast, which was amazing!"}
{"text":"When you walk in the music is bumpin. Sometimes you will get club like music and sometimes you will get Japanese music. I don't know when they play which. The waitress, Song, is awesome. If you get her then you will have a great time.  Everything I have ever eaten here has been fresh and has been really tasty. In fact, this is my FAVORITE sushi place. I would say it is about the same price as most sushi places.  Rolls i recommend:  Rabbit Pearl Love affair S&H Special"}
{"text":"This is my goto sushi spot! I come probably 3 times a month and if i could, id come more :) i love the variety and the consistancy here. I loveeee the daily specials that are available everyday too! If you like great quality sushi for the ayce price, Bomb is the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. We've always had very prompt and friendly service. It does occasionally get a little backed up but on average they are almost always faster than the other AYCE places I've been to. The food is always excellent as well. Will continue eating here and recommending it to others."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, there's another sushi spot a little closer to my work but i will make the drive to come here. The have really good lunch specials including their bento box which comes with your choice of two main dishes and side yummy. The guys are super nice and don't laugh at you when you can't pronounce something, the decor is very clean and updated. Going to a sushi restaurant I'm always looking around making sure it's clean and a little cold, we don't need to get sick. the price's are pretty average and the sushi tastes fresh. If your in the area defiantly check it out you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has positive reviews after my experience. Ordered Sushi Bomb via Postmates the other evening. We ordered a few rolls and a couple appetizers. Food came quick with no issue. We all commented on how good it looked and even enjoyed eating it...  Then the bomb came.... at about 3AM I woke up with horrible cramps. After literally crawling to the bathroom I spent the next hour or so (it felt like a lifetime) with it \"firing out of both ends\" and I do mean firing. It was horrible -- I may have to move.  After cleaning up I went to the kitchen to get some water and found my oldest in the main bathroom also extremely sick. I've never been so sick from food in my life. Never again."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. You get an insane variety of rolls, appetizers, and entrees to choose from for the \"all you can eat\".   Service is sub-par but for the food I can look passed it.   Try the Coconut Lovers Roll!!"}
{"text":"I had to grab a quick lunch and there were only a few options near where I was working that day, so I ended up at Sushi Bomb. The interior was not too big, but it wasn't that busy for a weekday lunch (just a few other dining patrons).  Service was friendly and prompt, and my water were refilled consistently. I ended up ordering a roll, an appetizer, and a miso soup, but realized that my items' cost added up already exceeded the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) price (~$21+tax). Thus, I decided to switch to the AYCE dining option, which includes most of the menu (except some that are excluded, some that are dinner-only, and some that you can only order once).  I was very satisfied with the value once I chose AYCE, as I was able to add several other items to my meal. To the restaurant's credit, food preparation and service was very fast, such that I was able to have a full AYCE meal in just 30 minutes (I originally did not plan to order AYCE since I had such limited time). FYI, the time limit for AYCE lunch is usually 50 minutes.  This location is a bit far from home, but if I'm ever in the area, I would consider returning for their AYCE specials! See my photos for details about what I ate.  P.S. This place is Korean-owned with Korean employees and even occasional Korean pop music playing, but no one said this was an authentic Japanese restaurant. I still enjoyed my meal here and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than most AYCE restaurants in Vegas (only by a few dollars) but very good and fresh sushi. If you're a tuna lover I highly recommend the Blue Fin tuna sushi they only allow one order per person."}
{"text":"Ordered two all you can eat sushi dinners, and ordered just a roll that wasn't on the menu. It was a salmon & cream cheese roll and the hostess/waitress said it would be an extra $1 for that??? If they want repeat business, they really shouldn't nickel and dime their customers! Very disappointed because the sushi was decent, but won't be back!"}
{"text":"Best kids meal ever! Salmon, veggie tempura, rice, miso soup, orange... all for only $8 and delicious. Great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible!! Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Rolls are trash and the hand roll selection blows as well. Avoid this place unless you like peeing out your butt. Step your game up Sushi Bomb. 7-11 sushi is honestly better. Disgrace"}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the sushi was excellent! I was seated immediately upon arrival and was able to order just as quick. I would definitely recommend to anyone I know."}
{"text":"The few times me my wife and son have been in here we have all enjoyed ourselves.  Try the screaming orgasm."}
{"text":"Nigiri was good, but too much rice and rice was sweet!? Croquettes, Oysters, Agedashi Tofu, and Salmon Skin Salad were tasty... no half rolls until your last order!? failed on the ahi poke, rolls were OK... they were out of 3 of the 3 desserts offered on the menu. Overall, just A-OK.....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi bomb is the best sushi place in the west side of vegas in my opinion.   This place has the option of either doing AYCE(all you can eat) or a la carte. I liked that when I went here last, some of our family members got to do a la carte instead of forcing the whole table to do AYCE.   The salmon nigiri is perfectly marbled and fresh it just melts in my stomach. They let you order half rolls which is just enough for tasting everything on the menu.   Highly recommended for those who live on the west side of vegas (this is on Cheyenne and 215) if you're too lazy or tired to drive all the way to the south side, strip, or Chinatown for some good sushi."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my top two favorite sushi spots in Vegas and I am a bit picky. Every roll that I have tried I have loved for all you can eat, and its not usually extremely packed which I really like because the service is great also. I cant wait to go back and would will probably recommend to anyone who wants some good sushi."}
{"text":"Bento box was pretty good. I wish it didn't have pork in it though . I had the salmon and  tempura . And I got a free saki when I checked in on yelp!#cherrybomb #saki #bentobox"}
{"text":"Not a fan. We had a party of seven with four doing all you can eat and three eating a la carte. One of the a la carte guests ordered sea bass which apparently is supposed to be larger than the all you can eat portion. When it was brought to the table he proceeded to eat it and then was promptly told he wasn't allowed to eat it because he wasn't doing all you can eat so when he told the server that he did order it she said \"Well it's supposed to be larger than that\" and then the server told the rest of the table that we would have to eat it. Why should we have to eat someone else's half eaten sea bass when the server was the one that put in the wrong order? She literally wouldn't let him eat the smaller portion and made him wait until his new order arrived. What kind of place does that? Another guest ordered a roll without cream cheese and when it came with cream cheese the server didn't apologize. Even if it was the sushi chefs fault the server should normally apologize on the chefs behalf with a simple \"Oh sorry about that.\" All in all the food was alright, nothing special. The wait after ordering was terribly long. There are so many other options for sushi in this town I would look elsewhere for your dining needs."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi! Was even hesitant to go because every time we do all you can eat my husband complains and doesn't like the quality of the sushi but we walked out of here and he said it was really good and we will be back! A few of our favorites were the bluefin tuna, jalapeño yellowtail , and whatever roll had double tuna on it, oh and I love that they had fresh wasabi! Yum !"}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 stars!!! Got here 1 hour before closing and still got horrible service some food never got to the table and we were hurried to finish our food because they had to leave???!!!!! I work I. The industry and this is horrible customer service!!!! Dessert was out oft he question since it's 950 pm and they close at ppm, huh???? Will never cone back here"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for my granddaughters graduation with 10 of us, not a very big place inside, but I must say it was great service was great, food was awesome, and the staff was so nice having so many of us to deal withThe price was very reasonable too! I definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"The staff customized my ramen the way I like it, even though it's not the menu. This is my go to Asian restaurant as there is not much up in the northwest. I recommend the orange blossom roll and my boyfriend always gets the chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"So in a search to find another good sushi place preferably in the NW my wife and I stopped in here.   The service here was very good even when they are packed...the rolls were fresh and cold. We have been back several times to keep our sushi rotation fresh.  If you come during rush hours be ready for it to be packed, as it is with most small places these days."}
{"text":"I really, really like this sushi restaurant! I usually don't go for the rolls but I eat a lot of nigiri. So when I got to this place, surprisingly ate a lot of nigiri (of course), but also had my fair share of rolls. Their price is a tad bit higher but it's well worth what they're giving out. The staff was friendly and attentive. It's a long drive but I like to go during special occasions."}
{"text":"GREAT sushi!!  The fish is very fresh.  Very Clean.  Good Service!  Great Prices!!  Open Late.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, I will give them that but god forbid you come in and one of the sushi chef's family comes in to eat, their service all of a sudden suck! We ordered salmon Kama first because it takes a long time to cook but they gave our food to the chef's family and told us 30 mins after that the kitchen did not get our order!  They need to improve their priorities in service. I get it, they are VIP but don't lie about our order!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi! Red Rock and Sushi Bomb are my favorite rolls. The service is very quick and efficient. Rolls are fresh and nicely made."}
{"text":"this place is pretty bomb. =) they have a lot of specialty rolls that i've never seen before. the all you can eat special is definitely worth it...$19.95 for lunch, $26.95 for dinner. its a bit pricey for dinner if you don't have the appetite for all you can eat. we ordered the Sunny D, warm spring, this guy, and another roll that was listed in the gray box on the menu (we ordered the first two). all of the rolls were SUPER yummy! the tempura ice cream was also super tasty, share it with your friends because getting just a taste is good enough. service was good but a bit slow. i want to go back already! =)"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Just like its name! The service was great, the food was amazing.  I got the AYCE and got the bacon roll(who doesn't love bacon), the tonight roll, sushi bomb, and the angry dragon roll.  All were amazing! I'll definitely be frequenting this place and I suggest you all do the same!"}
{"text":"Go hungry and leave full! Really good quality of fish and artistic rolls. They have a baja habernera  roll that surpassed my expectations. They are Korean owned operated Japanese sushi house. They have Japanese art decor but played Korean music. Good sushi"}
{"text":"If the food wasn't so damn good here, then we would never come back. We sat for 27 minutes before someone even came over to get our drink order. A table came in after us got their food before we got our drink order.  We waited additional 25 minutes for them to take our food order. The food comes out pretty quick and it's absolutely phenomenal. We've been here for several times and the service is always slow. It appears that they're severely understaffed.  The sushi itself is extremely fresh, edamame delicious, teriyaki chicken bowl amazing, you cannot go wrong eating here. The service leaves a lot to be desired.   Sidenote: they love to put avocado on everything."}
{"text":"Went here for sushi for a change of pace (we usually go to Kan Pai).  It's a little far for me, but the sushi was good.  They had a late night happy hour that was 20% off everything after 9pm, I believe.  If it was closer, I'd probably be a regular."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about sushi bomb. I dated a guy that lived around the corner years ago so it was convenient. I moved farther away so didn't go for awhile. No other sushi place I went to compared. Now that I live in the area again, I can walk up there.  I have people come from the other side of town to join me.  Sushi places can be a little indistinguishable sometimes. This place is great. They have my favorite roll that I've never seen duplicated elsewhere. Love Affair!!! It's a little sweet. Do that with a spicy roll. Amazing!  And try the Tasmanian Sea Trout.  Spectacular.  It's kinda small in there so if you go at 7 on a Friday or Saturday night, there's going to be a wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was great, love the atmosphere, would eat here again!  The server initially turned me off with his attitude but I quickly picked up on his humor."}
{"text":"My friend had been here before so we decided to go one night. We went for AYCE dinner ($27) and it was very enjoyable. We sat at the bar but it really doesn't make a difference here as a waiter still takes your order. Service was fast and friendly. My favorite roll of the night was the white house. The fish is great quality!! I also tried honey toast for dessert...it's honey drizzled toast with vanilla ice cream and will be the reason why I go back...it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend to finish with honey toast!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! This is my favorite sushi spot!!! I'm here at least once a month. I've never had a bad experience here. I'm not a fan of eel or shrimp and Danny the manager recommended rolls that didn't have them and he even told the sushi chefs to substitute things for me. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. It's close to our house and we always get exactly what we want. It has improved over the last few years and it seems like the owners are running a smart business model and reinvesting in the establishment. They have expanded the menu more then once and updated the tables and chairs, light fixtures, etc. The fish is always fresh and well tempered. The all you can eat deal is competitive with other places ($27/person for dinner). If my husband liked sushi as much as I do we would eat here 3 times per week!"}
{"text":"The Sushi is really good and fresh. No complaints! The place is small which is not a big deal. Since it's in a residential environment the place feels cosy and not saturated like other sushi places in town. I would definitely give it a try if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Fun sushi place with modern decor.  The all-you-can-eat includes everything on the menu which is awesome (includes apps and deserts!).  Watch out for rolls with banana and creamy sauces, as they are super rich and can fill you up too quickly."}
{"text":"Bukake!  hehehehe!  :P  That's a roll they offer, I don't really know what it means.    Now on to the review.  Maybe my expectations were high because of their location or the price I saw on their dinner AYCE (all you can eat) at $27 but I was dissapointed.  I ordered my usual nigiri first and I got three orders of tuna, two orders of salmon, one order of garlic tuna, one order of scallops to start.  They were out of Uni!  I would rather they be out of uni rather than serve me some bad or foul uni like some other places.  When they brought out my nigiri, all of them were on the same plate which meant the garlic tuna sauce contaminated the rice on the other nigiri.  While my friend and I were eating, I noticed that they kept the rolls and other nigiri on a counter and wouldn't deliver the food you ordered out right away.  I think they were trying to keep a nice eating tempo but I'd rather they bring all of the dish out right away, especially if they were baked or hot orders!  Have to take a star off for that.  The server didn't take our order on a piece of paper so we didn't get all the rolls or items we ordered.  That's why I like how some places have those papers where you can jot down what you want.  Another dissapointment.    Mind you there were only 2 other customers at the time so I expected service to be immaculate.  As far as the nigiri goes, I think they noticed that I caught on to the amount of rice that was given and they used a dab too much rice vinegar.  On my second order of nigiri, I had two orders of tuna, one order of salmon, sweet shrimp, oysters (you can only have one order), and two orders of salmon roe.  The portions were finally the way I liked it with the fish covering the rice and not the rice looking like a nice comfy bean bag for my fish to sleep comfortably on.  The freshness of the fish is good, they've got that right.    After I eat about 30 pieces of nigiri I go on to the rolls, but I like to order half rolls which I've been spoiled by other sushi places that allow it.  They don't allow it here.  So take note of that!  They have some funny names for their rolls.  I ordered two rolls (which could have been 4 half rolls...) and one of them being some secret eel roll which I did not enjoy at all because the center was spicy tuna.  I thought it would have been all eel.  My friend ordered some other roll which had a puffy creamy ball top which was bland.  I had to help her clean up her rolls because she didn't enjoy it.  We were actually thankful that they didn't get our orders right because the rolls were not headed towards the right direction.  I had one good roll which had a shrimp tempura middle but I would have rather ordered 10 more pieces of nigiri instead of that eel secret special roll.    You can only order one dessert per AYCE and even though I had great company and we still had a great time eating okay food.  They have drink specials and one other thing they have going for them is the beer special that accompanies the AYCE.  Drinking wise this place would be the bomb."}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE sushi here on my side of town!  There aren't very many sushi joints in the NW for us to partake in, especially of the AYCE variety.  I can probably count a small handful of places, and not all of them warrant a repeat visit.  I'm happy to say Sushi Bomb is a great option for AYCE sushi near us!    I gotta be honest though, out of all the various rolls we ate...I cannot remember the names of any of them!  I forgot to take a good pic of the actual menu!  All I can tell you is the night the wifey & I were at Sushi Bomb we ate good.  Stuffed to the gills good.  While Sushi Bomb is not one of my top places for AYCE sushi, it's up there with a more than enjoyable place to go.  We went for dinner on a Friday night (payday, yay), and even at 8 PM the place was lively with a lot of patrons...lots of kids too!  I know it's not considered KOSHER, but my favorite AYCE sushi restaurants are the ones that also offer a number of non-sushi appetizers to go with dinner.  Not traditional, but I like having a break from the endless amounts of rice that come your way with ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  Some of the apps we tried:  -Chilean Sea Bass (daily special) - this was sooo good! -Chicken Yakitori  As a rule of thumb - for sushi rolls at an AYCE place we usually stick to the higher priced items on the menu.  Why get a Cali Roll from the menu if you really don't have to?  Come on...live a little!  Try that soft shell crab!  Get some crispy salmon skin!  Sample that extra spicy tuna!  We got a nice selection of Sushi Bomb's special rolls, tempura rolls, chef special rolls, and baked rolls.    Honestly, from what I remember they were all tasty!  I know it doesn't help that it wasn't all that memorable, but at least for us the quality was there.  The rice to fish ratio was on spot, there wasn't too much rice.  And their sushi rice was very good too - not gummy or overly sticky.  For myself, I love those baked rolls.  Something about the warm mayo mix that comes from under the salamander, just makes a roll delicious.  Wifey on the other hand though hates warm mayo with a passion...ha ha ha!  AYCE also comes with a dessert per person.  But this was pretty forgettable because the desserts we got were not on par with the food earlier:  -Honey Toast -Tempura Banana   If you see the pictures, both desserts look the same!  Covered in a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  The Honey Toast was terrible!  It literally was a Hawaiian sweet bread roll cut in half and baked for a few minutes to make it somewhat toasty.  The Tempura Banana wasn't much better, heavy on the batter and thin on the banana.  I would skip dessert the next time or just get a scoop of ice cream to finish the meal.  Dinner is about $28 a person before tax, average with other AYCE sushi places in town.  Service was OK, but a bit rushed I think because for the AYCE you are limited to 1 hour.  There was enough time though to order another round of rolls though so I wouldn't worry too much unless you have a huge party.  We'll give Sushi Bomb another try...next time I'll be sure to remember all those rolls!"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant on trying new sushi places, but I'm glad I chose this one. The bacon roll is definitely a reason I'm coming back to this hole in the wall sushi bar. The all you can eat is a bit pricy for the menu selection but the food was amazing. Left satisfied and willing to return for more."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight....rude tried to make us leave early like 40 minuted before its closed.  They tried to not give us our buy one get one free.  And to top it all off....they put gratuity on our party of 5 when it clearly states 6 people for gratuity.  Om calling management and im going to complain....worse service ever. They didnt bring all of our orders and they tried to bpame EVERYTHING on the new guy.  We asked if we can split the bill 3 ways it was fine, but when we had to pay, they changed ot to 2 ways and that was already wheb we were about to pay.  So I dont want to go here anymore.  GREAT FOOD TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE.  ON TOP OF THAT TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF YOU EVEN WHEN THE PRICES ARE POSTED eVERYWHERE.  Cheaters rude and terrible"}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb was great! Our servers were very friendly and attentive. And the radish wrapped sushi was very good! I'd list all the types of sushi I ate but to be honest, I can't remember the names. I will tell you we ordered about 23 items and they were all good!"}
{"text":"The Worst Service!!! Very small, the service was lousy, our server (lady) lied to us about our food order when it was never brought to our table! My husband's Sushi smelled and tasted extremely fishy. Too many other great Sushi Restaurants in town to waste your money on this place. Will never go there again and I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been to in town. Not sure if they still have it but the warm spring is awesome. Mmm"}
{"text":"My boss loves this place, he is always telling me how great it is, but I had never been because it's too far north. Today my boss decided we should have a lunch meeting at Sushi Bomb, and since I love sushi I was not about to argue with him!  When we arrived we were the only people in the entire place. The hostess/waitress was friendly and efficient. Since it was 'his place' I let my boss order some things to get us started. He went with an order of edamame, some eggrolls and this fried jalapeno thing, I can not recall the name but it was like a popper, deep fried and stuffed with cream cheese.   The edamame was perfect, a nice large portion with just enough salt. The eggrolls were also good, on the small side but thats ok because I didn't want to get full on appetizers. I never eat jalapenos, but after some arm twisting I gave these a try... Was glad I did because they were not hot at all.   For the rest of our meal we decided on the the bj, the I love tuna and vegas rolls. Everything tasted great, the tuna tasted very fresh. The Vegas roll was my favorite, mmm cream cheese.   I'd go back to Sushi Bomb for sure if it was closer to me..."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot!! The food is delicious and the service is great. Philly rolls will always be my number one, but their Sushi Bomb roll is not far behind. AYCE is definitely the best option. There are so many appetizers and rolls to choose from. They allow you to order half a roll for your last order. Also, they include dessert to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Went last night... HORRIBLE service and to top it off, the \"Buy 2 get 1 free\" is no longer promoted there.   I wouldn't have been so disappointed in my first visit to Sushi Bomb if it weren't for our server. Seemed like she was upset to be at work! 3 of us went and the bill came out to $100... If I'm paying that much money to sit down and eat, I expect better service than what I got last night.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this business."}
{"text":"Family friendly.  Dropped in for some dinner with the family one night. The menu was pretty standard but the service was the great and best part of this business. Everyone was attentive and pleasent.  My son was given a high chair and the chefs  had fun giving him custom little fruits with bird faces which he loved it!  Recommend the banana crab dish!! Pretty amazing.  Overall Service: 4-5 Food: 3-5 Drink: 3-5 Price: $$ Come back: yes"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!!!!!!! Crowded but definitely worth it!!!!! Kid friendly too!!!!! Staff was super friendly and very attentive. Prepare to wait if you go during dinner time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again and I was very pleased. They have a ton of great items and it comes out fast. Dinner AYCE has a nice selection of one item orders."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have eaten here. Once again the food was incredibly fresh. We did AYCE and it was delicious.   I had a spicy tuna salad , cold soba noodles and a Tuna Lover 'a Roll . All good!  My husband checked in and got a free Sapporo.  This place has been consistently good- service and food wise."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and have always enjoyed it! Tonight was super busy but our server \"Mac\" was awesome! He was fast, friendly and checked on us frequently which in a full restaurant isn't always easy! Our dinner and dessert was fresh and delicious! Thanks Mac!"}
{"text":"I always feel like open late sushi joints are danger. Eat lots of rice and then go to sleep. That's how sumo tori bulk up. Kanak attack.  I've come here a couple times for late night AYCE ($27). Being that you can order ANYTHING off of the menu and the chalkboard specials and it's all under the AYCE umbrella, that's a pretty great deal. Some of their menu items included hamachi kama and okinomiyaki.   I really feel like the true testament to the nuts of a sushi place is in their nigiri. Find out what you wanna know ... it's in his fish. Anyways, the nigiri was kind of wussy, thin pieces of fish. Nothing exceptional, but also nothing catastrophic.   I think it's worth mentioning that all of the employees are Korean. There were three parties at the bar and no one else in the restaurant. The THREE sushi chefs behind the bar seemed to have trouble keeping up with orders.   The waiter boy isn't like a beck and call kind of guy. If you really want something, you'll have to stare at the back of his head for a bit.   #offthestrip #noncasino"}
{"text":"Sushi is one of my favorite food pleasures and Sushi Bomb did not disappoint! The service was excellent and they stayed on top of refilling our drinks and taking our orders. The appetizers and sushi were so flavorful. I highly recommend them if you enjoy good sushi!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST sushi I've had in Vegas. I'm from San Diego so sushi is my life. And I'm a very tough judge on it cause I used to eat it fresh caught every day. And this place hands down has the best and freshest tasting fish I've had out here. The salmon sushi or sashimi literally melts in your mouth. And every roll that I've tried so far has amazing flavor and I don't get all the baked ones and stuff, I stay on the healthier side with more raw fish in no rice rolls ect. And all the fish has wonderful flavor. Love this place and have been going a lot! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"great service great food and selection, my family enjoyed the sushi, I don't eat sushi but there are a lot of other choices, the chicken teriyaki was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service was good and the atmosphere is casual and cute. Rolls were fresh and tasty and you can't beat the price for their ayce. I've been here a few times before and I'll definitely return again."}
{"text":"Bad service and rude from an attitude waitress, big fat long hair asian, Jennifer (I believe that is her name). She only took orders and never came checked on us.   We were eating and enjoying our food with our companies - not loud,  not picky, or being a trouble maker. Other two severs,  a young boy and a young girl,  are great through - taking care of drinks and emtry plates away with great customer service. Food is all right.   After we ordered the 2nd round,  the attitude fat asian server, she came and said ''oh you know the policy right! (Look at my friend) yeah,  you know. We charge for left over\" Then walked away! We were looking at each other like,  \"what was that!\" But we did not think it was a big deal.   After the 2nd round of food were served, we were eating. Then she stopped for the second time and said,  \"you must eat all of rice too!\" Then walked away.  What?!?!  Really!!!,  she needed to do that again. We did not ask your policy or had a lot of food on the plate! Now, we felt like she hated us for a reason as we were specificlly threaten to charge more.   FYI: we finished the 1st set of order and were still eating our 2nd round of food. It is normal that some rice or ingredients were dropped on the plate as some sushi is loose or too big to the mouth. We did not have bunch of rice or food left over in the plate neither. We have been eating all you can eat sushi at many restuarants in Las Vegas and many cities for years and never had a server came and thread us in my whole life. This was a wow...   She might be a manager or partner so she has a ball to say that to us. It is very rude and inappropriate!! If she would charge me for a piece of rice,  go head and I don't mind to pay. If I don't have money to spend,  i wouldn't go there and eat at your restaurant. Don't need to be attitude and thread a customer like this! So unprofessional and lack of customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here years ago and had a terrible experience, but I am so glad we have it another shot! We went I again on a whim the other night and it was so delicious. The fish is super fresh and the service is great. There are tons of options on both the regular menu and the all you can eat. We are so happy to have an awesome sushi spot so close to home!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The spicy garlic edamame was soooo delicious that I didn't want to share. I know it's just soy beans, but it was great. Then there was \"the best chicken fried rice\" that my husband's ever had. Then there were the extremely filling bento boxes that my kids ordered. And I haven't even gotten to the sushi rolls yet - the Hulk (soft shell crab topped with more soft shell crab & avocado); the 007 (California roll with shrimp on top); spicy tuna & octopus... Very very yummy! We didn't order anything really exotic because if the basics are good, the specialties are usually better. Also considering that they only had two servers at dinner-time on Saturday evening, the service was pretty attentive. To cap off our meal we had a banana split consisting of tempura fried banana, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, caramel & a cherry on top. Good stuff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always crave the ex gf roll! Best place for ayce on the NW part of town."}
{"text":"I came here couple of days ago to do ayce with my family and it caught me off guard! What a pleasant surprise. They accomodated us even though we had a big group and service was quick and attentive. I wish i took pictures of the food we had but we were too busy eating lol sushi bomb roll is amazing and they also have draft sapporo beers for $3 a glass if you do ayce. They had unlimited bluefin tuna with ayce as their daily specials and i think we ordered almost 10 orders!!! I cant get enough of their porkbelly and spicy garlic edamame. It was super packed and had a long line out the door but it was well worth the wait. Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"You say sushi.... I say bomb....bomb!!! I found this place on Yelp attempting to meet my friend half way. I never knew this street had so many sushi places! I love the decor inside ...they have some really cool pictures adorning their walls.  I ordered a specialty roll I forgot the name but it had the word pearl in it. The rolls were topped with shrimp that had a bit of zing to it. They were little bits of deliciousness!  I also had the spicy scallop rolls which were also good.  I liked that they didn't rush my friend and I out after our meal. We stayed for about two more hours chatting. We asked them if it was okay and they were cool with it."}
{"text":"Tried AYCE, it was good except for the rolls were huge so I only ate 2. Really a ripoff if you ask me.  Everything was terrible on a third visit. They forgot my order, so while my wife ate her dinner, I stewed over the poor service. When I finally got my salad and sushi roll, both tasted horrible!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Friendly service and delicious  Can't wait to go for my birthday soon"}
{"text":"First of all, the all you can eat  price does not include nigiri And sashimi. Second of all, love affair roll that was highly recommended by the manager looked and tasted like sugared-fried cardboard. Their other highly recommended roll called this guy tasted like salted matza on rice.  Disgusting. Lastly, I personally love uni, and when we tried ordering it, they said they were out of uni?!! Really!?!  Overall, some rolls were okay, but I don't know if we'll ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Cool lodge-y looking place. Was disappointed the California roll was minced crab meat; I prefer chunked. Green tea had a nice flavor. Overall service was good, food was good too. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is great. But service is horrible!!! I used to come here all the time but it seems like the staff just went down the drian."}
{"text":"While on my lunch break,  I went in to place a few small orders to go.  This is a place I have been a few times,  I have not had this issue before.  The host was arrogant when telling  me that they could not run any orders for less then $10 on a credit cards. I told him I have done this before with no issues and he proceeded to tell me he had been there for 8 yearsand that's policy.  This is a big inconvenience and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very cute hole in the wall place.  When you walk in it's like Little Tokyo.  The quality of the fish is excellent...fresh, savory, and the right proportion (rice to fish ratio).  Their AYCE pricing is not bad...$18ish for lunch and $25ish for dinner.  Otherwise, the rolls al carte is reasonably priced. $7-$13.  They also have an great promo going right now if you go with friends--buy 2 AYCE and get 1 free.   Try the Love Me Long Time roll.  One of my favorites!  The staff is friendly,  fast service, and the restaurant is very clean. I love that they are open till 1am on Saturday nights.    **Fun side note: if you sit at the sushi bar,  they have this really cool toy box.  You put a quarter there and a cat comes out of the box to take it--hilariously cute."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!  Presentation was top notch.   Variety of rolls is amazing!   Hubby and son got the all you can eat and they enjoyed every bite!   I had the Spicy Tuna and Jalapeño rolls and cucumber salad!  Service is friendly and fast! The Asian decor is  pleasing and welcoming.   My first time and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great sushi place since I came out here from California.  The fish is excellent and fresh, and they do not overload their rolls with mayo like some competitors in the area. The decor is airy and hip.  Recommend Mr. D's roll and all of the sashimi plates.  Prices are fair - just took 6 of us to dinner for my boyfriend's bday, grubbed down and drank like fish (no pun intended) and our bill was under $150.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Good food.  Take forever for drinks to get refilled or would have rated at 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious and all you can eat is not too expensive! Love it! Coconut lover is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Best sushi in the Northwest without a doubt, especially if you like it fresh and flavorful. Sonny is a great host. Great friendly, neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"I should have been clear about the restaurant size, I think they have a little over a dozen tables, and about 8 seats at the bar. Now that I have been there a few more times, for dinner it is always pretty busy. Unfortunately, because the food is so good, this is a place where people really come to eat & almost everyone goes for the AYCE(all you can eat) No time limit option.... you know what that means- the Tables don't turn over that fast, but it is so worth the wait, if you had bad timing.  If you have 2 other friends with you, you have to go grab a bite, after 9PM, when it is buy 2 AYCE & get the 3rd FREE! There is also a $4 All You Can Drink: Draft Beer, if you get the AYCE, THAT'S INSANE! 1 Sapporo cost at least $5 everywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff was friendly and attentive. The decor was nice and the music was not-too-loud, fun Asian pop.   And the food was delicious! Reasonable all-you-can-eat prices from a huge menu. I even got oysters! The Rock & Roll and Fire Rainbow rolls were my favorites.   What a great find! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My coworkers all claim they have the best sushi place in town so we decide every few weeks we will try a different coworkers spot.  The price is average what I was expecting for AYCE but has a nice yelp deal for a free house sake or Sapporo.  The food was good not the best I've ever had for AYCE.  The reason I have this place three stars was the waitresses needed to be flagged down every time my group was there a little over an hour and only one water refill.  My glass sat empty for 28 minutes but I couldn't give this place lower than three stars because the food even though the customer service was atrocious."}
{"text":"I came back to edit my post. I had an extremely negative comment about how they had a waiter that was mean to the customers and that I wouldn't be returning because of his service. However, since then they have fired that waiter and the restaurant has done a complete 180.  They have always had good food, no one every doubted that, but their service was rude. Now the service is great and you can actually enjoy the food! Sometimes the rolls can be a little too big and hard to eat, but my boyfriend asked if they could make them a little smaller so they were easier to eat and they happily did, it came out with more pieces that were smaller so it was the same amount of food.   I'm sure we'll be back a lot because they are extremely close by and we do love their sushi, and now that they have fixed the service issue nothing gets in the way of enjoying that food.   Highlight: lunch special all you can eat is only $20. :D"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat on the northwest side of town! Typical pricing for dinner, I always love the mussels here and the rolls are not small like other AYCE spots. They have many great choices! Try the refreshing roll called \"Red Rock\"."}
{"text":"Wow. An AYCE sushi restaurant that doesn't overstuff every roll with imitation crab! How amazing. The real winner for me here though was the oysters. So.Darn.Good. Xoxo EatWithReese"}
{"text":"If I could give negative I would Walked in at 1:39 on a Saturday No one waiting in front of us but the restaurant was clearing from a lunch rush The waiter told us it would only be a few minutes for tables to clear, which he was right, but they ignored us and we didn't get sat until 1:57 even though tables had been empty for over 10 minutes 2 more parties came in while we were waiting and we all got sat simultaneously, however the last party got their drinks first and we were completely ignored. While waiting I also witnessed the waiter deliver the wrong roll to 2 wrong tables, and when he realized his mistake he picked up the rolls from the wrong tables and served them to the correct people We left after waiting at the table and when I called them to let them know what happened the tall waitress answered and said she couldn't help us because it wasn't her section. Stay away!! Their nigiri is poor quality and will make you sick So mad at myself for trying to give them a second chance. Beware!"}
{"text":"Ironically, the sushi is bomb. Anyone that lives on Kanye's daughters side of Vegas (North West) and you're craving sushi, stop by Sushi Bomb."}
{"text":"Consistently great sushi! Nice atmosphere. Chefs and servers are polite and welcoming. We should've watched Final Four here!"}
{"text":"Ive been to multiple all you can eat restaurants and I've never been to one that actually charges you if you don't finish your food... (picture included) of the items I didn't eat which, was gross, hence why I didn't finish it... and they would not put down a fight. The coconut shrimp was good, but I'll never make the trip out here again. Staff wasn't anything to write home about... I rather go to Doh or jjenga. Update-- didn't end up charging us after telling us they were going to."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service.  I try to go once a week. Paul is the best server there. Highly recommend sushi bomb"}
{"text":"They had a lot of variety and the fish was fresh. I liked the decor of the restaurant, although my only complaint is there is no stamp card system for the AYCE Sushi. The servers were friendly and the food arrived in timely manner, for the most part. When I went the restaurant was pretty busy which was a good sign to see. I will definitely come back as they have won me over as a returning patron. I do wish they had halibut on their menu, that would make this my all time favourite sushi spot to eat at. It's really nice it's at a convenient location right off the highway as well."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby for the first time and we were very impressed with the service and how fresh and delicious the food was.  I will most definitely come back again.  This will be our spot!!! Good thing we live right around the corner."}
{"text":"The name says everything. The sashimi portion are small and expensive. Not a fan of all u can eat sushi bars. Service for get it. Pass on this bomb."}
{"text":"Ehh it was ok. I'm a fan of authentic Japanese sushi/cuisine. This place is not that. I'm not crazy about all the sauce on almost every roll here.  I followed a previous yelper and I tried the warm springs roll..sweet spicy like dessert!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi joints I've been to so far.  I thought the food was of a lot better quality than most other \"all you can eat's\" out there.  It's a pretty relaxed atmosphere.  The waiter seemed a tad inexperienced, but he was very friendly so I didn't mind.  I've only been there for dinner, so I can only vouch for that.  It's pretty expensive though.  Expect to pay around $60 for two at dinnertime.  That's only if you follow the rules and don't leave any leftovers."}
{"text":"This is THE PLACE !... FRESH! FRESH! FRESH! That's why we come here when we crave for sushi, sashimi and other cooked dishes. All You Can Eat is our favorite choice and a great value @ 27.00!    Food is served fresh individually as you order.  My favorite is Grilled Salmon Collar, cooked perfectly! So is the fresh n tasty smoked whole mackerel, done right. Outstanding pork belly and teriyaki beef dishes too.  Delicious soups and salads compliment the dishes perfectly.  Service is above average!"}
{"text":"Horrible service on 5/11/15 at 5:30pm.  Been coming here for a few years!  Sushi was slow and not their best (that I've had.)  I'll be going elsewhere for a little while, and will return sometime later.  Get better Sushi Bomb...I love you guys!"}
{"text":"All you can eat but with high grade sushi   Menu is broken up with colored dots to let you know what you can have.  Blue dots are al a carte only, stars mean you can 1 order per diner. Green diamond is dinner only. The rolls are well worth it.  This particular Sunday they had a special on half rolls. Worked out since my wife is a light water. One of the rules is you must finish everything or you get charger full price. Makes sense since some people will order everything and eat half of it. Japanese lasagna is awesome. Tuna poke with seaweed salad was very good as well. Dessert options are many, only complaint was you get 1 mochi only. Should get at least 2"}
{"text":"Nice and clean plus friendly staff.  All you can eat costumers, make sure to order a lot of food at first because they take a while to come back for a new order."}
{"text":"I found this place yelping while driving around the new neighborhood that I just moved in to. It was around 6pm on a Saturday night and our party of 4 was seated immediately and greeted by our waiter Paul, who was an amazing server.  As any good server would, Paul immediately checked if we all had a setting, gave us menus and took our drink orders. Looking at the menu (each roll roughly priced around $12) AYCE is definitely the way to go.  When Paul came back with our waters and drinks he asked if he could get any appetizers started. We ordered the Garlic Edamame (amazing! Probably the best I've had at a AYCE place), Cold Tofu Salad (comes with a great and tasty sauce), cucumber salad, sea weed salad and oysters. Unfortunately after taking our order and putting it in, Paul had to come back to let us know that they ran out of oysters. It would have been nice for him to let us know before hand. He did recommend other alternatives and his favorites, which I appreciated.   We ordered many rolls but my top favorites were: 1.) coconut lovers roll 2.) salmon lovers roll 3.) BBQ rib roll 4.) Baja yellowtail roll 5.) Sushi bomb roll   Don't forget to end your Sushi Bomb experience with dessert! The Honey Toast is mouth watering greatness!   I am very impressed with this AYCE place. Great quality. Amazing service. And such good food. I'm glad Yelp brought us together and I hope to be back soon. It's a bummer that they got rid of the promotions that the other reviews talk about like the all you can drink draft beer with AYCE sushi for 4.99 and the buy two get one free deal! :( *if you read those reviews note that the promos are no longer going on.*"}
{"text":"Im actually giving this place 4 1/2 stars. It was my first time here. I am usually a visitor of Sin City Sushi or Yama Sushi. So I wanted to try something different. This place definitely lived up to my expectations. Did the AYCE. Wide variety of rolls. Service was great. The speed that the rolls came out was perfect. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Loove this place and the food! it is so good and the customer service is good...not great but good."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Sushi Bomb! The fish was really fresh! The have rolls that are not typical and are fantastic! We will be back for sure! Our favorites were Sushi Bomb roll, the DJ roll, and the Tonight roll!"}
{"text":"I always order from this place like 4 times a month and I nevered had a bad experienced. Food is great ! Oysters are fresh ! & the service are awesome :)"}
{"text":"I decided to try it out because coworkers rave about it. Their all you can eat was a definite plus. The sushi is okay. The service was excellent. The only prob I had was how my server decided to initiate my last meal to a half and cut me off of the all you can eat because once you cut your sushi from 8 rolls to 4, YOUR DONE! She should have recommended a smaller size rolls or a salad."}
{"text":"Had the crispy rice; my favorite, but it was a little too thin and too heavy on the spicy tuna.  I was extremely pleased with the service, cleanliness and the expectation she set with the order (how much time it would take to cook). Not wow'd by food but loved the service."}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb is one of my favorite sushi places in vegas. Everytime I visit I make it a point to stop by for the AYCE and great service!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how many stars to give. The FOOD is great. Love the X girlfriend roll. However the service is TERRIBLE. Been here many times and every time I get the same grumpy would rather not be here service. I will probably not be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted sushi, but did not want to go far,  Yelp helped me this sushi bar close to my home in Centennial Hills.  I was quite pleased with their all you can eat menu.  The slices of fish on the nigiri sushi were some of the biggest I've had here in Las Vegas.   The only thing I found off putting was the music, a strange mix of rap and country.  Also they don't have a card to stamp that adds up to a free meal, but overall I was impressed."}
{"text":"Great food plus good prices and clean friendly environment.  Love the hot and spicy edamame."}
{"text":"It's just meh. We have never dined in, only had to go but the sushi isn't anything to be wooed over. It's ok."}
{"text":"so damn good! Friday night is busy but its always good and staff is great.  AWESOME just awesome.  My favorite is the La roll"}
{"text":"Not the best out there but it sure beats a lot of the competition.   The all you can eat value deal is the reason I go.   The number of options that they have with california rolls is astounding. I have not encountered one thing I didn't like on the menu yet, either.   The only trouble I have ever had here is when I showed up late. I thought they were open for another hour. I got the buffet option and then only had 15 minutes to eat it all up. I was hoping they would cut me some slack, but no, they had to get going. Not entirely their fault, I know. Would have been nice to have had a few extra minutes to dine though."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far for sushi. Got sick the first time within a couple hours of eating. Thought we'd give it another try again tonight and see and I was sick again. Would not recommend. Have eaten at several other places in town and not had an issue. Not sure what it is about this place. I wanted to like it but I can't."}
{"text":"We've always had a great experience here. They recently redid their menu and the food got even better. Plus, the ambiance in here is the nicest of the local sushi restaurants.   All of their rolls are great (we have tried almost all, and would probably order all again) - my husband loves the New Mexico roll, and it's good but a bit heavy on the cilantro. My favorite used to be the rabbit pearl, but I think they got rid of it. The orange blossom is good, Red Rock roll is good, and their namesake roll is good.   You can only order a half roll as your last order, so order wisely."}
{"text":"AYCE is the way to go.  If you order a couple of rolls and dessert you have paid the equivalent of the AYCE price.  Several appetizers are delicious the edamame with garlic, baked mussels and dynamite dish are good starters.  They do not pack the rolls with a lot of rice like other AYCE places. They have a great variety of rolls  & they arrive in a reasonable amount of time.   They will work with you if you have allergies with no attitude which is refreshing !  Dessert is included if you can save room. My favorite rolls are  The monster roll The Vegas roll Spicy tiger  Shrimp lover roll Philly roll"}
{"text":"I come in here literally every week & I love it. It's my go to sushi place nearby. Except the last 2 months so recently the prices went up & the rolls got somewhat smaller so that's quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. I had Edamame, a California roll and Chicken Katsu. The service is average. There's a minimum charge on credit card so I ordered a Sapporo and it was fine. I will be back but it's not my go to sushi place."}
{"text":"Wow, they call it sushi bomb because I am about to explode!  Came here for lunch with wife and daughter.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Thanks to by BFFs at yelp we gave it a try!"}
{"text":"This used to be mine and my friends favorite spot. Don't know if we'll be back. Food took forever. And when we were done 4 different people came to our table to ask if we are ok like within a 10 minute span. Most restaurants it's kind of obvious if the guest isn't eating anymore or ordering anymore food, and says they are ok, they are waiting for their check. This waitress came up and said with a snobby attitude if we are done yet? Yeah!! We were waiting to get our check! Then after she asked us 3 other people asked if we need our check. Way to make a guest feel like you're rushing them to get out, but the kicker is we were ready to leave but waiting for them to get our check. The only nice person was our waiter I would have rather just dealt with him instead the other waitresses especially the snobby one."}
{"text":"Hello Again!  I have written a review about Sushi Bomb before (back in Nov 2011), but this time, I have to say, I won't be going back :(  The last review I gave them was 4 out of 5...Only a 4 cause of how slow the service was during lunch.    My friends and I dined there last night (March 30, 2012).  It was a Friday evening and it was another couple and our son who is 1yr 1/2 old.    So our bad journey began with slow service and a very very rude waitress.  I should have gotten her name (there are only a few servers that work there - she was the slightly older skinnier Asian lady server.  The younger one with wavy hair was very very nice!    Our bill was over $170 - All you can eat and drinks.  So for paying this kind of money at any restaurant for 4 people, would EQUAL = = = = GREAT SERVICE!  Wrong.  Our reservations was for 7:15.  We did not get out of the restaurant until after 10pm.  This was not our choice because our son was ready long LONG before.  I told my friends that our lunch service was slow and given that the restaurant seemed busy, I suggested that we try and order all your rolls at one time.  We ordered most or rolls so we didn't have to wait as long.  However, we needed a couple more.  I guess when you order more after the first round, you will have to wait cause others will be priority over you... or so it seemed.    When I told the guy (Host-with a girly kind of hair cut-not trying to be mean, just didn't get his name and that's the only way I could describe him) who said he is the manager, his explanation was and I quote \"the first round of sushi you probably had a fast sushi chef and they are all different, this time, you probably had a slower sushi chef and his speed is slower than the first guy that made your food\"   :o  WHAT??     We waited over 40minutes from when we ordered a couple more rolls before they came out (after a couple complaints too).  The server would barely ask us what we wanted nor did she seem happy to be there.  She was in a bad mood.  I totally get it, we all have bad days and we have busy days too that can drive us to the ground, but when the economy is the way it is (people seem to be pickier about where to eat or spend their money on), then I think customer service is going to help any business fail or succeed.  Bottom line, we should not have been treated the way we did.    -We asked for waters twice. -We waited over 15 min. for her to take our order the first time. -We had to keep asking for refills  -We asked for 2 cucumber salads in the beginning and never got them - until about almost 10pm cause they new at this point we were upset - we even said never mind on the cucumber salads  -We were treated horribly by our server the entire night (with the exception of the Host/Manager & that other server that tried to make it better)  -Our rolls the second time took over 40min. to come out - we did not order anything different than the last time, with the exception of us ordering only 3 rolls - lot less than the first round  Unfortunately, because of all the series of events that happened last night with the slow service and the extremely rude server, etc. etc. Our entire group will not go back.  There are far more sushi places that would deserve our time/money than this place.    I do not recommend this place to anyone with kids or anyone that wants to leave within less than 2 hours, especially for dinner.  I do have to say the best roll there is Sex on the Beach.   The all you can drink Sapporo for $3.99 is a good deal.   Make a reservation!!  We did and it helped but there were people waiting outside. Unfortunately for us, all of these things though will not help us go back.  I rather drive all the way to \"I Love Sushi\" in Henderson that isn't an all you can eat and pay just as much or a little more because I know they are deserving of my business.    I hope someone from Sushi Bomb reads this because I hope you improve on your customer service!!   Just a side note: We tried to tip the other nice server (cause she started to help us a little more at the end) and she said they all have to share the money - community tips.  Where is the incentive to do better and be a better server and treat people better?  There really isn't with this type of tipping service.    Overall bad time and we all left frustrated.  Our night didn't end well and that's not right.  :(  Sushi Bomb dropped a bomb on our night! It shook us up so much, they we are not going back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots because it actually looks fairly nice inside. Can't stand restaurants who don't take pride in their atmosphere. Food was good as usual. Only issue issue I have is with front if house service. Not terrible. Just needs improvement."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in tonight for dinner. We were seated at the bar by a women server who then took our drink order and walked away. We waiting a few minutes thinking she was going to come back with a menu but she never returned. I then asked the sushi chef behind the bar if we could have a menu. He asked the same reserver who seated us if she would grab us a menu. I watched as she asked another server to help us because she went to go take a bigger party's order. We waited about 5 minutes and still no menu. So a total of 15 maybe 20 minutes no drinks bought to us and still no menu. As we got up to walk out she stood there and watched us leave. No attempt to apologize or say anything.  I give this place a 1 star based on customer service. Also I want to mention the place was not busy."}
{"text":"This is our sushi \"go to\" place. conveniently located in the neighborhood but more importantly it is the food here that earns my 5 stars.   We have been coming here for the past 2 years repeatedly when we crave sushi. Its very family friendly and authentic in depicting the japanese decor theme throughout.   My favorite roll here? The \"Tonight\" roll! Nice & spicy the way i like it.   The best time to come and the biggest bang for the buck is all you can eat lunch special which expires at 3 p.m.   We love Sushi Bomb! Cause its \"Tha Bomb\"!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience,  I been coming here since 2012 I got my stamp card. Two things happened. They gave me bad salmon. It was slimy and then they tried to charge me cause I didn't finished. When I ask to speak to manager the manager never came. They took care but for four pieces of sushi. I understand if I was being wasteful. But I wasn't. That will be my last visit here."}
{"text":"I came here again from out of town with family.  i got the same amazing service as i did from over a year ago and the sushi roll au du toilet is still on the menu and is atill as amazing as i remember.  Danny was once again my server and he even recognized me from the last visit.  The experience here is unparalleled from sushi to service always impress me and Danny is the man as always."}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb is a small but fantastic place to catch sushi and quickly leave.  Located in a small plaza in Cheyenne St by the 215, this is the place me and my buddies go after Church on a Sunday morning so it's never been busy or crowded for us.  They give you very big servings on sushi and sashimi. All you can eat lunch for $19.99.  Very easy to get full on just two sets of rolls here. Sonny our waiter (might be the manager too) is a very friendly guy and so are the other staff which you can regularly yelling out your order loud with heavy japanese accents.  All their special rolls are pretty tasty so you can't really go wrong with any choices.  But the common rolls, such as the california roll are no better than what you usually get from other sushi restaurants. I recommend going with a group of friends and order different specialty rolls so you all can have the chance to try different ones. They all have their own twist of flavor that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food...5 stars for the value!  AYCE lunch is around $20, with an AYCD option for $5! I had 3 Sapporo drafts, at about $1.50 a piece!  Most of the fish tasted fresh, some with great flavor actually! A few seemed a little dry and not quite as fresh, but I only noticed that on some of the nigiri.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=53bUbCJxe5R69uRhPbJX7Q#53bUbCJxe5R69uRhPbJX7Q  I really enjoyed the Unagi here...it had a slight crispiness to the edges that added a lot of flavor and consistency!  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=n_VviZZu0wZCAX_N4wGdBg#n_VviZZu0wZCAX_N4wGdBg  I really enjoyed the Sake Kama here!  They don't include the Hamachi kama in the AYCE, so the salmon had to tide me over! Had a great taste...better than most actually!  Probably the highlight of the lunch for me :)  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=GityQ5CHwRvSUC36LtnJIA#GityQ5CHwRvSUC36LtnJIA  The rolls were great, with my most favorite being the Rabbit Pearl : Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crab and Cucumber topped with Spicy Crab, Shrimp and Avocado...Spicy ponzu sauce and crunch!  This was easily the best roll we tried in my eyes! Perfect amount of spice and flavor!   Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=TLsxftXGuTx6odSFz-lcKg#TLsxftXGuTx6odSFz-lcKg  I really liked how they include Yakitori as well! The beef was ok...a bit chewy, but good overall. Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=vCJPc5iGyjaFVRR4OzMETQ#vCJPc5iGyjaFVRR4OzMETQ  But easily shadowed by the Scallops wrapped with Bacon! They were great and melted in your mouth!  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=O3-khFYVdrmZjk-XRcqsfw#O3-khFYVdrmZjk-XRcqsfw   And of course, to finish for dessert...they had Honey Toast! Of course I had to try it...a few choices of ice cream, but the Green Tea actually had lots of tea flavor and was yummy! The toast itself was good, plenty of honey...and was overall a good choice!

Check them out if you are ever on this side of town...all the way on W Cheyenne and the 215!  It would be worth the drive to switch it up :)"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has gone downhill.  It's so close to my home that my family has been ordering to go weekly for quite a while. In the last month our order has been wrong twice, and we are told the order will be ready in 20 minutes, arrive 30 minutes after placing our order to give some extra time and still made to sit and wait another 30 minutes!  For mediocre sushi and terrible waits and false promises try Sushi Bomb.....but don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Really good food & sake & service. Just a little quiet & boring but overall good experience. Also should add Mochi to the menu!"}
{"text":"I have sent so many friends here and spent several nights a week sometime here eating sushi. I love the ALL YOU CAN EAT. Order the pork belly.. we get our extra crispy. You can order so much from the menu and it is all really fresh and good. The Spicy Edamame is also a favorite of mine. Have to order every time. If you like desert then order the honey toast."}
{"text":"I watched this place being built in my neighborhood when it was first coming to fruition and we were all so excited about having a sushi restaurant in the north west especially when it's slim pickings in this area Of great places to eat without having to drive down the hill on Cheyenne and of course this is before downtown Summerlin graced us with its presence. --it used to be fantastic.   The music was fun, and they even had a ladies night and they were open till 3 AM with a reverse happy hour into the late hours. It was phenomenal .  ...not only have we spent birthdays and numerous graduations since they opened obviously they have changed hands since then.   The food has always been good the service always has been impeccable and it's always been quite comfortable.   Until today. Someone formerly mentioned in our review recently that the service is all over the place and indeed it is. I sat down as I waited for my son to join me who was coming straight from work I was there about five minutes and barely had a sip of my water when I was approached by one of the head waiters and asked when my \"party or a partner or friend\" was arriving. I had barely put my purse down. I told him soon in about two minutes later my son arrived. Said waiter came back and took her order the food arrived promptly which was great and it was also delicious barely a bite into my salmon skin hand roll , which was greasy.and mediocre at best, and the waiter appeared again asking \"what else were having for our second round,\" ...well I have a full mouth of food and have barely started enjoying my dinner, so I don't know if there will be a second round .... I just want to enjoy my dinner and the company I am with.   He obviously has had no social skills or tact when he waits on tables he was quite rude and pushy and honestly I have to say this is been happening for quite a while I've had this chubsy waiter before and he was pretty much a jerk ....there was about six people waiting on us.  It definitely doesn't have that personal neighborhood flare that it used to have. it almost seems like a assembly line of sushi which is really disappointing because I remember what it used to be like when it first opened. Which is really too bad because this is around the corner from my house and it really used to be our place to go. I thunk Sishi Kota has won over my business. It's far but I feel appreciated and don't mind paying for great service and great food, I work hard and deserve both.  Do t we all?"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! I always do the AYCE and have yet to complain.  They have the BEST menu selection.  I have friends who don't really do the sushi thing, but their appetizer/cooked food menu offers more than just chicken teriyaki.  So, everyone is happy.  Their fish is fresh, the rolls are delicious (try the Sweet Tomato), and the restaurant itself is beautifully decorated.  The best part...lunch is only $21 and dinner is $26.  They also have a stamp card system - free ayce after 10 stamps.    As for all the complaints on the waiters...I haven't had an issue. You'd be surprised how far a genuine smile will take you =]"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in town. Prompt, friendly service ands great atmosphere. Great full menu that does not disappoint. Appetizers are just as great as the rolls."}
{"text":"Best place and people EVER!!! Andy the head chef is absolutely amazing the nicest person you can ever meet. He converted me to a sushi lover, i would always come here with my wife and just get non sushi food till Andy got hired he had me try a couple of his specialty rolls and made me my own onion ring roll. Now I love sushi and don't mind when my wife asks to come here, I actually ask her now to come!! BEST BEST PLACE EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so Im here with family my sister is the manager at a major restaurant on the strip. I have more thank than 10 years in the industry. And by far I have one of the worst experiences in a very long time. So we Hager there at 9 pm and hour prior closing and the told us that we only have 30 min. To order. So we ordered apps. And told the waitress to tell us when last call is so we can order sushi. We got AYCE $27 which is expensive for a neighborhood restaurant. But we all though I has to be really good......well it wasn't! All you can eat doesn't include a lot! Of things like most AYCE include. We were rushes the whole hour we were there...they did not bring every we ordered and at the end they still rushed us out and it wasn't 10pm yet. Truthfully I will never be back again and I will tell anybody on my neighborhood of the experienced we all had."}
{"text":"This place is 40 minutes from my house and I still travel that far just for this amazing sushi. I have been to over 30 sushi restaurants and this one has to be one of the absolute best. I did AYCE and I have to say my Favorite part is their appetizers. We tried almost all of them I loved them all. My favorite roll was the Love Affair roll. The restaurant was extremely clean which is a HUGE plus for me as well. Staff is super helpful in guiding you through the menu to get you exactly what you will love!"}
{"text":"This review EASILY changing to a5 Outstanding on ALL fronts. Fresh fresh fresh food! And establishment appreciates return business on top of it all. Very unusual these days, but in clear evidence here! This is now MY place!"}
{"text":"Newest sushi place in the lone mountain area. The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is fantastic. The fish is fresh and never tastes \"funny\". The \"this guy\" roll is my favorite but lots of other wonderful choices on the menu including some non fish options. They have Mochic which is my fav desert! Always friendly and always good. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Everyone needs \"their\" sushi bar.....and this one is mine! Between the friendly service, quality/fresh fish, and the great AYCE options , this is definitely a great place to enjoy sushi. I always fear writing a great review puts the ease of getting a table at jeopardy , but without support, your favorite place can quickly become a distant memory. So give it a try, enjoy the food, but don't take my spot...lol!"}
{"text":"Love this place they have seemed to have gotten busier and food is great. All you can eat is so worth it and reasonable for $27 for dinner, sushi bomb and red rock rolls are my favorite. I am always there once every other week"}
{"text":"What happened?! Sushi bomb used to be great. Hate the new menu layout, my favorite roll is gone, I would have paid more for the old menu and quality of fish. Almost gagged when I was served bad uni. SO SO SAD!"}
{"text":"**Summary**        - Freshness - The freshness is around average.        - Rice - All the nigiri has way too much rice in them. Anytime I see that, I wonder what other corners the establishment is cutting.        - Service - The sushi chefs were nice, but the waitress had an attitude problem that day. It was almost as if she was scolding me for not knowing that I had to order mussels and other items from the sushi chefs and not her. Furthermore, she never processed my dynamite order.        - Originality - This place has a lot of rolls I've never seen including the Stuffed Tomatoes and This Guy roll.        - Rules - They have more rules than your average sushi joint and some weird names for their sushi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=4r09Hm_dz_GKp_GSKIkYvg). **Price**        - $19.95 Lunch AYCE Open - 3:30pm        - $26.95 Dinner AYCE 3:30pm - Close **Ordered**        - This Guy Roll (Tuna & Avocado Roll with a Spicy Soft-Shell Crab Ball with Spicy Garlic Ponzu Sauce) - The ball of spicy soft-shell crab was nice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=j8FE2cjU71vIaKhWHD6M9A).        - Stuffed Tomatoes (Imitation Crab Meat, Avocados, Shrimp, wrapped with Salmon with Orgasm Sauce) - No rice in this roll. The sauce was a bit too creamy though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=-z1r1fRYJV98K71-ySmxXQ).        - Golden Dragon (Eel and Spicy Tuna on the inside topped with more Eel) - The eel and spicy tuna center made this roll feel like I was eating baby food (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=SuFaUOaT7v_pAr0E-JubIA).        - Grilled Bacon & Scallop Skewer - This was a great skewer with eel sauce to top it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=A9yP1_X_Z0jmV9eu1fuRWQ).        - Grilled Shrimp w/ Vegi Skewer - The shrimp were pretty tiny, but it was good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=l5AhXwmWFLr6zxHGrcNmMg).        - Nigiri - The sushi wasn't the freshest I've had in Vegas, but it was decent. However, the sushi is to rice ratio is pretty bad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=o34ITC4o8tVbZ2Njh8VUmQ).        - Sushi Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=MSAhVq4gwgC_RyxERv0xlw)        - Baked Green Mussels - They used some kind of sour sauce instead of eel sauce that made the mussels taste terrible. This was the first time I didn't finish a mussels on my plate ever. **Recommendations**        - If skewers and rolls are what you're looking for, this place isn't too bad. However, if you're thinking of ordering nigiri, you're probably better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The customer service is very nice and fast. The food is ok. The sushi grade tuna wasn't cut proper cause the membranes were in. The unami was good just like the chicken teriyaki. Nice to see there's a Japanese restaurant close by but I think the cook needs to add more flavoring next time. Good place to go for lunch during work for something different."}
{"text":"Leaving the house to grab dinner, my friend changed her mind and wanted sushi. It was her birthday weekend so I had to comply. Jumped on Yelp and pleased to find this bar was only 1/4 miles away and had good reviews.  Both of my friends really enjoyed the food here. My sushi palate is a bit more sophisticated so I wasn't as pleased. The service was extremely good but we were also the only customers in the restaurant at the time.  The chef was extremely friendly and talkative. When I ordered some hamachi sushi, he cut me a fantastic piece from the belly. It was excellent. On the other hand, the spicy tuna was not; it was pre-made and very mushy. The hand roll didn't include any yamagobo or even a few pieces of cucumber.  I was also a bit disappointed in their sake selection. I asked for a ginjo sake, but the best they had was unfiltered."}
{"text":"Sushi lovers!  This is your place!  The best part about this place besides the delicious sushi is the all you can eat!  They have lunch and dinner prices and both are reasonable, although I can't think of the prices off the top of my head.  There is a wide variety to pick from and all rolls are amazing! You will defintely leave satisfied!  Customer service is great as well!"}
{"text":"I was on this side of town and thought I'd give this place a try. Apparently arriving 15 minutes before the dinner service starts assures you will be paying $7 more for ayce so I opted for ordering 2 rolls. The Japanese lasagne was decent. Although not a large portion. The salmon lover roll was bland and disappointing. The prices are definitely not worth it ordering rolls individually."}
{"text":"This place has been getting better and better since Andy showed up. He's got some great new fish to try like the salmon belly (which they use a blowtorch on!!!), the giant scallop, and the sea bream. Oh my god. I went back twice in a week and did AYCE the second time because it was so good.   Definitely a delicious lunch or dinner spot."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night (11/2) with some friends.  Had the AYCE.  The service was great.  The selections were not just the normal.  They had Ocean Trout which was very nice along with Giant Clam.  Mmmmmm.  They also offer all you can drink for an extra $6.00 so it is well worth it.  Rather than getting a pitcher, we got glasses, so the beer was always cold. You just had to ask for more beer.    We went early (5:30 ) and by the time we left a little after 7:00 the place was packed."}
{"text":"I must say that the food is great at Sushi Bomb. The problem I am having is with the service. More than once we have been treated like we are lucky to be eating there as opposed to them being happy we are their customers. We eat there at least twice a month, but its starting to get to the point where we no longer enjoy going there.  Not sure if management is aware of what is going on.  Like I said good food, not so good employees."}
{"text":"Done with this place! Have it be lunch or dinner I'm done with this place Togo lunch orders take 40 minutes they'll tell you 20 in the phone then it'll be another 20 when you get there and don't even think of saying anything as they will say your early people only get certain amount of lunch time. Ayce dinner used to be my favorite they are so anal my 5yo touched a edamame I mean just one and they told me u had to pay for an order he's allergic to soy and likes to just open them just petty off my list!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I only go here in a bind when my favorite sushi restaurant is closed because my favorite sushi restaurant I'm Sundays doesn't open until I want to say 4 PM well I came here and I got the unlimited all-you-can-eat sushi which sometimes I don't get it but lately I've been doing that restaurant and I got thee coconut shrimp sushi roll what I was doing the all you can eat one night and I would go back again and again just for this coconut roll shrimp now the  sauce they put on the Coconut Shrimp has a unique texture to it so I'll let you figure it out on your own what you think of the sauce when you see it on your plate and feel it in your mouth but it is amazing .... amazing nothing compares to this roll everything else is just ordinary but this roll is mind boggling"}
{"text":"I love sushi bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have a great have option and servers are attentive. They can get really busy on the weekend but I still come eat whenever my family is in town. Best sushi place in the northwest!!!!"}
{"text":"good sushi but a little expensive for the quality. Doesnt stop me from coming though."}
{"text":"Nice, upbeat place.  First visit tonight and we had 4 rolls 4 peaces of sushi with the plum ice cream to top it off.  Staff was nice and friendly with the place having a nice local feel to it.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place!  It's absolutely delicious!  Plates are beautifully presented, service is quick and friendly.  My favorite:  Screaming O salad.  The chefs up front already start putting it together when we walk in the door...I love it so much.  My daughter loves the Teriyaki chicken entree.  AYCE is the way to go."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place! The salmon lover is my favorite  and the staff is always super helpful and fun."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Service was all over the place and the quality of the fish was mediocre. A lot of the pieces were tough and tasted like it had been frozen. On top of that, both my friend and I that ate there got sick after eating there. The only good note is that the raw oysters weren't bad. but I will definetly not return."}
{"text":"So I've ordered rolls and picked them up a couple of times before for dinner. They were always good! Let me say that myself and husband are not \"real sushi\" eaters. We're like... beginners. I'm fond of the \"snow rabbit and red tiger\". The bacon wrapped skewers are amazing. I was craving sushi for lunch and saw that they had the Ayce lunch special for $21. Listen.. it was so good we went twice in one week . You DEFINITELY get your money's worth doing the Ayce because you can pretty much get anything on the menu. Teriyaki chicken.. dessert.. The first time we went it was at 11 30 & service was great. The second time we went it was 12 &  got EXTREMELY busy.The problem was that there was only ONE SERVER.  Why have one server at lunch time? He was absolutely overwhelmed. The service was painfully slow.. people walked out.. there was a lot of complaining. Poor guy. I was irritated but when we FINALLY got our food, it was delicious. I'll definitely be back, but hopefully they won't be understaffed."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service! Highly recommend the specialty rolls. (Warm Springs and D's Special) We eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent sushi, it doesn't blow my mind, but it's good. What I don't like is the fact that you can't order from the bar. I love sitting at the bar, and every sushi restaurant I have ever been to, you can order from the bar. That's why I sit at the bar, so you can order the moment you're ready to eat again, and not wait on the waitress. Also, they seem to be understaffed every time I go there. Their menu is set up in a strange way, and it was confusing at first to read. I've been there a few times with my husband now, and I can navigate it a little better, but otherwise if my husband didn't like this place and it wasn't closer to home than my favorite sushi places, I probably wouldn't ever go here again."}
{"text":"To begin with, the service was incredible. I had only been in this place two or three times and the hostess and chef remembered me. The fish was fresh, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was relaxed. I've taken a few friends here and each of them have returned on their own. Three items that were good were: garlic tuna, Japanese lasagna, and 007."}
{"text":"Food was good but because we had 10 pieces of sushi left we were charged. We ate most of everything and there was not even close to a full roll left. We only ordered 3 rolls a piece so it wasn't like we over ordered. They lost two good customers because of this nonsense."}
{"text":"Visited this sushi spot for the 1st time last night with my family for my nieces birthday. It was very busy so that was a good sign. They don't take reservations but you can call and tell them what time you'll be there and they'll put your name down at that time so we didn't have to wait too long. That was cool.   It is one of the more expensive all-you-can-eat prices at $27 but they did have a great selection and the sushi was fresh and tasty unlike some AYCE places. They also had on a daily special a Chilean sea bass ,it was amazing. Sucked that we didn't notice it till after we were full but we ordered it anyways. Couldnt pass that up. They also have, if you get the AYCE, Sapporo on draft for $3!   Our service was good. And the people were nice. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was freezing in there. they said it was something about keeping the fish Fresh,which we were like, well why is it any other sushi place freezing then? It did end up getting turned down halfway through our meal. Thank goodness.  Also, the music was  quite loud making it hard to hear each other. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Food here is outstanding. I've been to about twenty different Sushi places in Vegas, and this is in top 3. All you can eat is surprisingly great, 58 dollars total for two people. Muscles are fantastic, the sushi bomb is good, and staff is fast and friendly.  You can't go wrong, try this place. I was surprised this place doesn't have five stars!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday for dinner. The service was great everyone was really helpful and attentive. They have a wide variety of sushi selection. I love their rice to fish ratio. Most sushi places use so much rice. I would try their udon noodles, it was amazing. This has to be my go to sushi restaurant. The decor of the whole restaurant is so pretty."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Bomb many years ago, but I never went back because i wanted to go to a place that offered half rolls. I'm the type who likes to try different rolls. I decided to come back here with my husband and our seven-year-old, who loves sushi & can eat just as much as me, because we only live about 2-3 minutes away from this sushi joint.   To my pleasant surprise, they now offer half rolls! Woohoo! Guess who was a happy camper that day? Me! We tried Coconut Lover, Love Affair, Sushi Bomb, Japanese Lasagna, Mojave Beach, bacon & scallop skewers, nigiri (tuna, Cajun albacore, salmon, & eel), shrimp tempura, miso soup, and baked green mussels. Everything was delicious. Our absolute favorite was hands down the Coconut Lover. My husband fell in love with it! The nigiri was delicious and fresh. The baked green mussels were PERFECT! Miso soup was just the way my dad makes it - so delicious. And all you can eat bacon & scallop skewers? BOMB! My second favorite is definitely a tie between Love Affair and Mojave Beach! Mojave Beach because it's a mixed of different flavors and textures & it's very light!  We are definitely going to be regulars here. My daughter scarfed down probably 20 pieces of salmon and eel nigiri alone. I can definitely say that this is our new favorite sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Awesome. We have been trying to get in here after a karate for a while. We may have foiund our new favorite sushi place. My wife and I both had all you can eat sushi...$27. We thought that was reasonable. The top of the list of items we had were, the Sishi Bomb roll, the White Rabbit and the Red Rock roll. My wife said she would come back for just the Red Rock roll. I agreed.   While it's just lilttle a littleI, The wall, itl is top notch."}
{"text":"Lots of great variety and the sides don't taste the same like other ayce joints. Sushi is always on point so it's definitely worth the 30 mins drive for me. Jennifer is always a delight, giving us the best service ever!"}
{"text":"We ordered miso soup and a bunch of appetizers including Cheese Salmon sticks with deep fried asparagus, which took a very long time to cook, it came out much much later than the rest of the food. Agadashi Tofu was grainy and not silky like we are used to, Gyoza was good, Tempura Combo was excellent-light and crispy.   Friend had bento box and said it was fine, nothing special. The lettuce in the salad was all white romaine ribs.   Service was attentive, but disinterested and occasionally overwhelmed. 3 sushi guys up front keep their heads down and keep working. Very serious. Very rarely do they look up or greet customers. A very minor mumble for one customer they re"}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places. Especially when we are super hungry and wanting to indulge in All-You-Can-Eat.  The sushi is good quality, especially for being in Las Vegas, and what you are going to pay.  I have never gotten sick from here, and I keep going back to take that for what it is worth.   I think they have very good specialty rolls, and there is a lot of selection available to you. I also really like that I can order half orders of rolls when doing AYCE to that I can sample more types of rolls.   They have a good selection of everything you could need/want for a sushi night.   The place is smaller, but there is plenty of seating.  It does get crowded so if you are going during a high time, you will likely need to wait a little bit.   The only reason it is 4 not 5 is mainly the service.  it is not bad, but not stellar either.   I will continue to go back, and if you are in the area I would give it a shot."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the years because it's close by and its pretty good. I usually order the same thing no matter what sushi restaurant I go to. Edaname, Philadelphia roll, and Japanese lasagna. I do enjoy their Japanese lasagna, best I've had anywhere. Service can be a little slow. I'm not quite sure why I'm even reviewing this place since I'm not a sushi expert."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. The seaweed was tough and the sushi did not seem very fresh. The tempura veggies were pretty good."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times in the past. It is not bad Not my favorite but it is good.  My Son goes here all the time and he has ordered some different rolls that I tried which are not to bad but I am not into going to a Sushi place to pay for AUCE to pay for a ton of rice They use a lot of rice sometimes when making the rolls.. So I would rather pic some of the items that don't come with too much rice.  The fish tastes fresh and the service seems to be pretty good the times I have been here. It does seem to be a little more busy than the place down the road that I have been to a lot more which is a bit cheaper too.  I love sushi and sometimes its nice to have someone suggest what to try until I have been there a few times."}
{"text":"The food here was definitely the BOMB!!  Everything was so flavorful and absolutely delicious!!  The service was impeccable!!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think their all you can eat price is a little high.  It's $27 when most places charge $20-$25.  But I'm really not complaining because the food and service are really good. I will definitely go there again.  My 2nd time here and it was just as good as the first. I upgraded them to 5 stars. I cannot say enough great things about this place!!!  Everything was so good!!!  I'm still full and I want to go back.  I especially loved the bacon wrapped scallops!!  Service was also great this time too.  My sushi place from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is my favorite sushi place in all of Vegas! They have the best service with a small restaurant feel. My husband and I would have lunch and dinner here all the time when we lived in the northwest part of town. They have a peanut butter roll that is hands down the best!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on other positive reviews here.  I tried the Warm Springs Roll, the 007 roll, a spicy tuna roll, and I had the honey toast for dessert.  The sushi was very fresh and quite tasty compared to other sushi joints in Las Vegas. The staff were very friendly and service was prompt. I enjoyed the decor as well, including the paper lanterns."}
{"text":"This place I frequent and is virtually the only sushi place I go to. They get busy.... Yes, but their quality, convenience and cleanliness is worth it.  I've tried a ton of rolls from here (worth doing all you can eat for $27 at dinner) My favorite though, Is the shrimp roll. It has cooked shrimp both inside, outside and avocado on top with eel sauce. The spicy deep fried jalapeño one is also a stand out.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the mochi. It always has a taste about it that I'm not fond of. As if it hasn't been separated from the garlic or other seasonings in the freezer. Other than that.... Spot on."}
{"text":"The coconut lover roll was good , the summerlin pkwy and baked salmon did not taste as good as I thought it would have. In fact, taste didn't differ from each other. They both tasted like the same thing, must of been the topping or sauce. Service was ok, a little slow."}
{"text":"Yum...yum...yum!!!!  We decided to try the restaurant after reading the reviews and I am so glad we did.  The lunch All You Can Eat is only $21 and the rolls are delicious.  The restaurant is very clean and has a relaxed atmosphere.  This is now one of my favorites.  Pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. I've tried everything on the menu and they have never let me down. My wife and I love the food. She especially likes the spicy garlic edamame, which goes great with the quality sushi they serve. If you like to drink, add $4 to the price of your all you can eat sushi and you get unlimited saporo on draft. You can't beat it"}
{"text":"The food is very good, the service is not!! Took us forever to get our food, server very rarely checked on us. They are like sushi police unnecessarily. Environment is uncomfortable due to them being overly paranoid. They've never offered frequent diner card, had to ask for one. We are return customers because the food is very good, but we will definitely try to find a new spot."}
{"text":"I ordered all you can eat sushi. Found a really long black hair deep in my spicy tuna (after putting it in my mouth) and was absolutely disgusted. When one of the waiters came by with the other sushi I ordered, I attempted to show him the roll with the hair still in it. He wouldn't give me the time of day. Asked if I ordered the roll he was holding. I attempted to show him the hair & let him know I didn't want the roll or any of his food. A girl came over & she didn't care about the hair either. I don't have a problem paying for my food, but I'm disappointed they didn't care, there was no apology, they left the rest of my table alone, and they charged me for the first roll. Super disappointed. The service wasn't great either, usually isn't but I overlook it taking into consideration that they get busy. Not my problem! Won't ever go back there."}
{"text":"For the price and options you receive for the all u can eat is not worth it. The good thing about this place is it's near by and it's not in a high traffic location and that's it. I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning by eating their raw fish. I've never gotten this gut wrenching feeling from any sushi restaurant I've eaten."}
{"text":"We live in the area and over the last couple of years, some friends recommended Sushi Bomb. Normally, we go to Sushi Fever on West Sahara, which is fairly legendary.  So last night I finally gave Sushi Bomb a try.  I have to be honest, it was very underwhelming.  The quality of the rolls were on par with what you would buy in a grocery store deli.  The sushi is not terrible, but it's mediocre at best.  The ingredients were not as good as the place we normally go to (Sushi Fever). While the prices at Sushi Bomb were slightly lower than Sushi Fever, the difference in quality leaves Sushi Fever as the overall better value.  The decor and ambiance is cool though.  And the staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"DJ roll & salmon poke is amazing! The roll is about $13 and very filling. Also the service is great. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This has become our go-to Sushi place. The AYCE lunch is an excellent deal. We get half rolls go we can try as many new selections as our tummies can handle."}
{"text":"Sushi Bomb has really good sushi with tons of variety. It's better if you slowly enjoy your food instead of stuffing all in your face and take your time savoring their sushi with each roll you order. Sushi Bomb also has good daily specials and bomb appetizers."}
{"text":"Third time here. Great meals. Beautiful presentation and a very courteous staff. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place should be called Bomb Sushi, cause everything is bomb and delicious!. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times in the past couple of weeks. Sushi is still tasty but the three stars is for the service or lack of.  Each recent visit the bomb has been busy but the service on the floor can't keep up. From the basic checking on drinks to reordering the staff does not seem to have any organization. Our table had every server wait on us - because we had to flag them down  Even after 4 of our party of six left (full) we waited for 15 min and THEN had to ASK for our check.  And they added the gratuity well above the level of service we received  Been one of my favorites but they better get their service together. Lots of choices out there."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. It's very hard for me to return to places with bad service. There are plenty of other sushi places I can go and not wait 47 minutes to get the check and/or a water refill. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"New ownership, new management, better service! The food is still good! They no longer serve the Kiss My Ass roll, but the Golden Dragon is a nice substitute.   The Sushi Bomb roll, spicy garlic edamame, pork belly, and the sea bass are all recommended. They also have Honey Toast, which is delicious pretty much everywhere.   I'm glad I can recommend my favorite sushi place again!"}
