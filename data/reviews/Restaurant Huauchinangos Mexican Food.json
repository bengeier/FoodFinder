{"text":"I loved this place. The salsas are fantastic. The green and habanero are delish. I had the quesadillas. They come in a light green sauce that is full of flavor. Try out a couple different meats in them.  Definitely recommend trying this place. It's more southern Mexican, which is a bit different style."}
{"text":"Deliciosa comida, la salsa habanera riquísima, tiene un sabor especial que sólo en \"el huachinago\" la puedes probar,  me encantó que tienen opciones veganas recomendadisimo."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Mesa and am very glad I found this place. Food is excellent. I don't typically enjoy Mexican restaurants on this side of the border, but this one has the authentic mexican comfort food that I love."}
{"text":"Amazing food, totally Mexican food, love the salsa & everything was very tasty. Really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best tacos Al Pastor since Mexico City!!! Very helpful staff. The others are correct when they rave about the sauces !"}
{"text":"Decent food for the price. Lots of different unique flavors, mostly spicy. The Pastor tacos were very good, meat quality of the chicken was a little dry. The Habanero salsa has a good flavor until the heat kicks in and burns your lips.  I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"El servicio no era tan buena pero la comida......riquísima!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch. Our waiter recommended the quesadillas and the were fantastic! Spicy chicken, Mexican chicken and chopped beef. I'll will be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic restaurant, always soccer on the TV. :) Helpful, self serve salsas, and great prices. I order a marinated pork burrito with sour cream when I go, but have tried other menu items too.  They also have Jamaica which I haven't found elsewhere yet. The number inline doesn't work, but they are happy to five you their number if you come in, they also can prepare orders ahead of time."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Their variety of authentic Mexican food as well as great prices makes it one of my go to places."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious fresh food.  Excellent service.  The fresh tortillas and carne asada are amazing."}
{"text":"I have lived in Az. for over 50 years and my wife an I have been eating at all the little mexican places in search of good food. This place is authentic for sure! The food at Huauchinangos is fresh homemade authentic mexican food from Huauchinango (80 miles N.E. of Mexico city). The menu was confusing because I wasn't familiar with most of the things on it. But they have tacos, burritos, enchiladas and such. The chips are exellent and the refried beans are even better! They make their hochata and jamaica fresh from scratch. Delicious!!! The staff are kind and courtious. (Owner and wife)  Their hours are 8-10 except Wednesdays (close at 6)."}
{"text":"YUMMY.  The quesadilla (sp) were amazing.  Incredible taste and texture.  The pork and mushrooms .yum... Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite, and some of the most authentic Mexican food you'll find in AZ. Personal recommendation, get the quesadillas you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like places that offer a different version of cuisines I love. This place is that for Mexican food. I had the tamales were pretty good, a side beans also tasty, and the sopes which were absolutely delicious. The place is simple and colorful. The service was friendly enough although a bit inattentive once I got my food.   My biggest complaint was out of 10 tables, three had  used food and dishes on them... which is pretty unappetizing. They were not cleaned the entire time I was here until I was about to leave. I   I'd come back because there's so much interesting stuff on the menu I'd like to try. Just hope the tables are clean."}
{"text":"Small Place but it has Great Mexican Food! Very Traditional Choices! Ala Cart items are awesome! Homemade Tortillas to Homemade Antojitos. Oh and Cafe de Hoya! If you are a Foodie like me and like places that are not chains. This is a great choice. Close to ASU area, Tempe Marketplace off the 101."}
{"text":"Great disappointment. A waste of money. Food was tasteless and burritos were all rice barely any meat. Salsa tasted cheap store-bought type.  The \"torta\" was supposed to have meat and there was none, just a cut-up hotdog. This was no Mexican food. One star because it's the lowest option"}
{"text":"This is real authentic Mexican street food that you may eat while visiting the areas around Mexico City while on vacation. Same Tasty Menu and Friendly Owner from the Restaurant that he had at Mckellips and Miller in Scottsdale before he relocated. The menu is full of several family recipes that he has gathered from back home. Always fresh and flavorful. He has been in the Best of PHX issues a few times in the past for his Quesadillas. Just do a quick search at New Times for Huauchinango and they pop right up.  This is a Mom and Pop hole in the wall place. It is in a strip mall that looks a little tired if I can say so. Inside is nice, clean and casual with a kicked back sort of feel. The game of Soccer is a favorite there and you will notice a cool mural painted on one of the wall of a giant soccer stadium as well as a beautiful display of trophies from some of the teams they play in or support. There may be even a game playing on the TV from Mexico.  Everything is made from scratch. No mole from a jar. Being a foodie myself I have talked recipes (some top secret) and types of chili pepper used as well as techniques with him and I am amazed at what is involved to produce an authentic product. This is no Filibertos so do not expect that style of fast food.  I have tried just about everything on the menu including the BBQ lamb they sell on the weekends that is slow cooked in a special covered pit just like they do in his hometown. You can pick from several types of meats or styles. Chicken Tinga, Chicken with Chiltepin, Carne Asada, Marinated Pork, Carnitas, Chorizo, etc. Some of my favorites are the assortment of Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, and Tamales (I get him to deep fry mine). They have the BEST Habanero sauce in town. Other great dishes are the Enchiladas, Quesadillas and the really authentic dishes like the Huaraches, Tlacoyos, and Mole Poblano. Some even come with tender cactus sliced up and added to it.  Easy to drive right passed. No main signage on the corner but only on the building. Small language barrier when asking specific questions about something you may not have tried before but well worth the effort. You will be pleased. Like my friend in Tucson Isabella J. says \"Keep it local when you can\". CASH ONLY. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch with my husband and two girls (4 and 1 year old). They have authentic southern Mexican food.   My girls had the kids chicken strip meal which came with 2 chicken strips and some fries. It was $4.50 which is pretty typical for a kids meal but did not come with a drink.   My husband had the hawaiian torta ($6.50 I think) and said he enjoyed it. I had a quesadilla (they are known for them) with Mexican chicken ($6 for 3). I really enjoyed the quesadilla. It came smothered with green chili sauce, lettuce, and queso fresco and the corn tortilla is definitely homemade and absolutely delicious. The chips and salsa are amazing too. They come with a green salsa that tastes a little like an enchilada sauce and is so yummy. They also have a small salsa bar.   The only downfall was they did not have fountain drinks. They are on the menu so maybe the machine was down? No worries, they had Mexican bottles cokes.   The owner and a younger kid (maybe his son?) served us and were so nice, friendly, and helpful explaining menu items and making suggestions. We will definitely return to try more of their delicious food!   Oh and the neighborhood looks a little sketchy but it isn't that bad."}
{"text":"I was really looking for yummy cuisine in Mesa and I found it.  The quesadillas were delish and the hibiscus drink was exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"The food was great, but was a bit pricey at about 15 bucks for lunch for me. The Menu is in Spanish so point and pick at this place. Also only takes cash so no card here."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had, the al pastor tacos was amazing the service was very friendly, I will definitely go here all the time for tacos. The habanero sauce was really good if you like spicy food. Amazing food the server was friendly."}
{"text":"The've got quesadillas, burritos, and tacos; get 'em deep-fried, they're all uber tasty and must be tried. The carne asada plate is off menu but not to miss, it comes with handmade tortillas, that plate's pure bliss. For take out, this just can't be beat. I wouldn't dine in during the summer, it's disgruntling, ugh, that heat.  The good: Boy those tortillas were super delicious. The habanero salsa was spicy, tasty and all around awesome. The carne asada is delicious, a must get if you're hungry and anywhere nearby.  The bad: Mesa, it's just so far, I'm not usually close enough to go out of my way to order their tacos. Air circulation, I just don't understand restaurants that have a dining area with poor quality air conditioning in the phoenix area. There's about 5 months of the year it's just not comfortable to dine in :-/  Overall, I'd definitely return and order take out if I'm nearby, I might even dine in if it's between October and April.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Wow-Chinango!  This place has the only decent plate of Puebla-style chilaquiles I've had since my time in Mexico in the '80s:sloppy, spicy, tangy, and filling.  And that's not the only dish on the menu you've never heard of.  They have mejorales, tlacoyos, and a few other creative ways of cooking and serving masa treats with their distinctive green sauce.  I took the families of two of my sister here, and I still hear \"Wow-chinango's\" when they talk about Mesa.    The owner is very patient and friendly; he seems to enjoy explaining the dishes like any excellent waiter.  We speak Spanish, so I am not sure how easy it would be to order in English only.  Prices are Filiberto-range.  Atmosphere is basic, but I enjoyed studying the photographs of Huanchinango Township on the walls while our food was cooking."}
{"text":"The tacos are fantastic and only $1.35 each!!! Steak, chicken, pork you name it - epic! They also have tongue tacos...wait for it.... Cash only."}
{"text":"My roommate, her martial arts teacher (who is opening a new martial arts studio two doors down), and myself stopped in for lunch while we were working on the space...   I must say some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. Huaraches con Carne Asada (large thicker than average corn tortilla, which are made in house daily, with grilled marinated steak, shredded lettuce, thin layer of refried beans, queso fresco and salsa verde that was rich and delicious) was incredibly flavorful and authentic, as were the Tacos al Pastor(grilled steak with grilled pineapple). Everything is homemade, the owners are very friendly. So nice to have something other than Filibertos et al. Will certainly be stopping by anytime I'm in the area, actually I would go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"The carne de puerco con salsa mora y nopales y champiniones is amazing. The flavor and the tinge of spice is just mouth watering. I'm not sure how to translate it into English but it's basically pork, with cooked cactus and mushrooms. With an amazing sauce very similar to mole but a different type of flavor. That's what I would recommend not really a fancy place but defiantly clean and friendly staff. A review said they only take cash but I paid with a card"}
{"text":"Tonight was an example of why I love Yelp. Husband and I searched for \"tacos\" and this place came up with glowing reviews from fellow Yelpers. I had passed this restaurant a million times, but had never given it a second thought.   I had the tlacoyos with eggs - the thick tortillas were supremely satisfying, and the nopalitos were the best I'd ever had. It was a treat to try out Mexican cuisine different from the usual Sonoran fare found so often in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food, and the owner was friendly. After I ordered my food I realized I should have ordered the mole, ni modo, maybe next time. Food and service was great!"}
{"text":"This'll have been my 6th time here and I'm finally remembering to write a yelp review. Perhaps it's because I was too into the amazing food to care about anything else until I was ready to burst at the seams. Or maybe I have crap for a memory. Either way I keep making my way back and for good reason. Tasty authentic food and attentive friendly service have always been on point and after 6 times the consistency of these two fundamentals of the restaurant biz is was sets this place apart. It's worth the trip in my humble opinion but just know, you're not coming for chic decor or the trendy location."}
{"text":"************************************Rough Gem Alert********************************  This isn't a fancy place and it's not your usual Mexican Style Restaurant. This is a small Puebla Style Restaurant.   What is food from Puebla?   I don't really know but what we tried tasted AMAZING!    There are lots of words or things on the menu that maybe you never heard of like Molotes, Tiacoyos, Huaraches, Chalupas and Huachitlacoyos. Don't worry about it because I think they all are some kind of fried corn or Masa Dough in some kind of various shape.  There are things on the menu like \"fall off the bone\" \"Melt in your Mouth\" Chicken in Spicy Peanut Sauce....That I enjoyed! The chicken was so tender and flavorful. The sauce was so yummy with an interesting hot pepper kind of tickle in your mouth. My plate also came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, rice, beans, soup and Maybe the BEST homemade hot steamy tortillas I ever had. I think the tortillas were actually better than the tortillas I had from the tortilla factory in Mexico. The tortillas were a little thicker and what was special is that they hugged the contents you put inside. (all that food is more than one person can eat and only was $10.00)   My husband had the Chorizo and Potato Stuffed Molotes, topped with crisp lettuce and shredded cheese in a tasty sauce ($7.00). A piece of steak was added on for $3.00 (total $10.00) I was told this plate was delicious and it worked really well all together. Steak was a little chewy but also was tasty.  (what do you want for only $3.00))  I can tell you just from one visit that the prices are very low and the portions are very large but more importantly the food is delicious!  You do need to know that the menu is written first in Spanish with some English. The Family working there can speak English to answer questions that you may have.  On our visit service was efficient and friendly. We felt welcomed.  The low down. This is not a fancy place and looks a little worn. Soccer is the theme of the decor.  On our visit the air conditioning wasn't on so it was uncomfortable to us but they wait to turn it on when it gets really hot.  At this time there is no longer a public restroom.  You need to bring cash to tip. (but it always better to use cash at small businesses because they need the money)  Tremendous Value Dining and a Taste of another Culture.  4.5 stars ******Really Special"}
{"text":"Deserves 3.5 stars and willing to return.  Reasonable prices.  Authentic dishes.  Folks working there very nice.  Was there for quick and quiet Friday lunch circa 11:30 am.  Only one other dude in the place.  Spanish language soccer on the big screen.  I had a $7 plate of tlacoyos de garbanzo - which are basically thick, lightly fried masa cakes which are smeared with bean paste and then topped with some shredded lettuce and dry crumbles of a white cheese.  Served in a pool of watery green sauce.  Light (not greasy) and tasty.  Good option if headed to Cubs Park, which is about 1.5 miles away."}
{"text":"I come here when I think about getting mexican food, and nowhere else. Family owned and operated, best non-sonoran mexican food you can get in the valley."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  I thought I had reviewed H (I can't say it, much less type it) before.  Oh well.  I was a patron when they were on McKellips and loved it...loved the food, loved the prices!  It was sad when they moved, and somehow in my mind, they had moved waaaayyyy far away.  When I finally looked at a map recently, I was kicking myself.  All this time, I could have been delighting in their little street tacos, the spicy green tamales, and the perfect al pastor wrapped in anything!  I'm kicking myself again!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. Is a little casual spot, the service is really good. Will definitely come back to try more of its menu."}
{"text":"when we walked in we had to go get our own menu and sit ourselves. I got Chile verde with pork and my boyfriend got a huarache de chicharrón. they served us a handful of chips and a sour green sauce. not spicey at all! 15 minutes later our food shows up. the chicharrone was aweful. tasted like old oil and so soggy. on my plate was a row of beans a row of rice and 2 chunks of meat in a pool of the same sour green sauce. they waitress saw our plate and asked if we didn't like it. not to be rude I said it was fine. very disappointed to pay 22 bucks and tip for \"authentic Mexican food \" true Mexicans stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was out quickly, and I really enjoyed my chalupas. My husband said the enchiladas were a little bland, which is why I only gave 4 stars. Definitely a hole in the wall, but you often find the best service (as we did)!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great customer service. The ladies working there are super nice. The food comes quickly. I went with my fiancé and kids and we all loved it. My son got the asada and al pastor tacos, my fiancé got the chicken chulupas with egg and I got rice and beans and green Chile chicken tamales. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and they now take cards so those of you waiting to try it because you hate cash are now ready. I want a to go menu so I can call ahead...which they don't have yet.    Their marinated pork is delicious in every dish I've eaten.  Also their Chicken Mole' is as good if not better than Adrian's down the street.    Their food is traditional for the Huauchinango region.  Enchiladas are served with their traditional lime sauce which is refreshing and delicious.  I was skeptical until I tried it and now I crave it...they must put  heroine in it.  I go every other week for sure!      Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican food.  The best home made tortilla - so soft and thick.   Makes all the dishes stand out.  The quesadilla is the bomb, totally different from the Americanized ones we might associate with (you know, made with store-bought thin dry tortillas). It's lightly fried and folded, SO good.  Less than $50 for 5 people's dinner."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant with an authentic taste in the food.   Kids soup is a traditional Mexican soup that every kid likes and the adult meals where really good too. We had enchiladas with a pork chop on the side and a huarache.  The pork chop was perfectly cooked and had a great taste. Everything else was also good. Spicy enough to to enjoy comfortably."}
{"text":"I've never stepped into the restaurant and already they're getting a bad rating. I called the restaurant and asked if they had \"caldo de pollo, (chicken soup) and whomever answered beginning laughing at the way I speak. I'm a throat cancer patient with a prosthetic device and they made fun of me. Great job"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is spectacular! The food is very fresh. Service is excellent and very friendly. The intimate spot allows for reasonable pricing. If you like authentic Mexican Food you have got to try the enchiladas with a side of steak. This dish comes with large enchiladas stuffed and the \"wet\" green sauce with lettuce and cheese is unforgettable!! You will not be disappointed trying out this dish.  The salsa bar is very good. Watch out for the spicy sauce it's not for the light hearted. Also try the Mexican drinks too. They accept credit cards and cash. Don't let the strip mall detour you from stopping by and giving it a try!!"}
{"text":"Legit Mexican food! I feel like I've had kind of a hard time finding GOOD, LEGIT, Mexican food for a good value, but this is it!  I had some quesadillas that were amazing, and their salsa was amazing. On top of that their service is great. Super friendly people. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Mexican food around Found this by mistake and I will now be a regular. The service was amazing if not better than amazing and the food was to die for"}
{"text":"I ordered two fish tacos and a chorizo and egg burrito. The fish tacos were SO good. The downside is that they are served on one tortilla, so it got messy after a couple bites. Fresh veggies and great salsa verde. The burrito was a bit salty. The serving was way more than expected. I could have shared it and will been satisfied. Customer service was done all in Spanish. Once they realized I mostly speak English they switched it up no problem. Seating is at plastic covered tables and metal chairs. I'd come back again for the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Huachinango might be hard to say for some people but don't let that scare you This is one of most authentic Mexican fares I've had in awhile The tlacoyos alone have guaranteed I'm gonna be coming back"}
{"text":"Such good, authentic, cheep Mexican just minutes from the airport. Very friendly, helpful staff. Get the spicy salsa from the salsa bar and dig into fresh huaraches!"}
{"text":"The tacos I got were not that great, just ok. I got the tripas, carnitas, and pastor tacos.  The tripas were a lil soft. I like mine crispy.  The pastor was finely diced and a bit overcooked. It also had small pieces of pineapple which I usually just pick out if they have it.  Carnitas was WAY overcooked had dried hard chunks in my taco :/  However, I may go back and try something  else on their menu. That habanero salsa was fire!"}
{"text":"This is the type of food made by a sweet, loving Mexican grandmother. I know because my husband's nana makes the Sonoran version of this at her house :). The food represented at this restaurant reflects the Puebla region, and I was excited to see mole verde on the menu since I've typically only seen mole poblano at Mexican restaurants here. After browsing the menu, this is what I ultimately ended up with since I've never tried mole verde before. The menu is in English and Spanish but it does help to know some Spanish since there are a few descriptions on the menu that might be hard to decipher without a basic knowledge of it.   We were first served some chips and tomatillo salsa. The chips were fresh and crispy while the salsa was tangy and went well with the chips. The mole was a generous platter with a heaping portion of rice, beans, with chicken thigh and leg. The sauce was wonderfully executed and paired with the chicken beautifully. I was a fan of the very flavorful rice and beans as well. The meal came with these delectable hand-made corn tortillas. They were soft, pillowy, and oh so good. You will never look at a store-bought corn tortilla in the same way again!  I washed everything down with a horchata which was sweet, ice cold and refreshing.  Service was friendly and the cashier spoke English and Spanish.  The only negative is that the restroom was absolutely disgusting. The toilet paper was off the roll holder and thrown haphazardly onto a dirty baby changing pad and the floors and wall were suspiciously stained. A bathroom shouldn't make you feel scared to touch the surfaces and things on or in it, especially the toilet paper!  Also, let's just say that this strip mall has a very well-worn feeling to it and the same can be said for the restaurant.  Note that they do accept credit card now but there's no option to add tip to your credit card bill so bring cash if you are going to tip.  I definitely want to come back and sample more of the delicious cuisine here.  P.S. Shout out to Mark R. for his review and delectable looking photos that made me want to try this place out!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in the neighborhood, I usually walk here and get their tacos because they're pretty good for the price, I'd recommend this to anyone wanting some good quick Mexican food for a decent price."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time late afternoon yesterday, and there was a steady stream of people coming in for take-out while I had the wet cheese enchiladas and three of the al pastor tacos.  I'm giving the place five stars based upon the flavors and recipes which are clearly fantastic.  The salsa bar has three different:  a tomatillo salsa, a red one, and a habanero sauce---all quite tasty.  The table tops were clean in this modest place and the people were friendly.  The cook was eating a mole dish that I will try next time.   It's my opinion that a TV with the volume turned on inside a restaurant  (rather than say inside a bar) is a negative thing, but perhaps others like it on...  I'm sure I'll get more adventurous and try the unfamiliar menu items soon----I trust the people in the kitchen here."}
{"text":"I cant begin to explain how much I can appreciate a good ol mom and pop shop. This place definitely fits the bill!  I had the quesadillas (corn) of asada and cheese and mushroom....it was delicious!!  The price cant be beat ($6 for 3) either.  The server was so sweet and helpful and she spoke English so she was able to explain the menu....which she was happy to do! I will definitely be coming back. Love...love...love this little gem! And for those who were hesitant about the cash only thing...they now accept card. Just bring a few dollars for tip. They definitely deserve it."}
{"text":"Huauchinangos is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant, I eat there at least twice a week. If you have never been, definitely try the Milanese Torta with the verde broth to dunk it in. If you get any of the platters or tacos, always go for the homemade tortillas because they are out of this world. If you can handle the heat, their habanero salsa is probably the hottest stuff on the planet. Pretty sure it could cure a bacterial infection..."}
{"text":"This little \"hole in the wall\" - \"where the heck is it\" Mexican joint is amazing.  It is CASH ONLY so beware before coming in.  The food here is incredible and a very different set of flavors than most Mexican you'll find in the Phoenix Valley.  I've sampled much of their menu and the main standout feature is the sauce.  They have incredible sauces! From the salsa's in the bins to the salsa that comes with the chips or the sauce they put over the quesadillas it's all amazing.  They have perhaps the best torta I've had.  This is a very different and unique experience compared to the majority of Mexican available in the city.  It's homemade menu, not the standard \"[fill in the blank]-berto's\" menu you see at most places."}
{"text":"found them after the moved, stealthy!  pronounced wou-chee-NAN-go but you will say WOW-chee-NAN go with the two key syllables  being WOW & GO!"}
{"text":"Ohhh man the habanero salsa is soo !@#ing GOOD!!!  It's not like a painful burn, it just makes you sweat.  Cheap, easy lunch specials.  We call this place \"el authentico\""}
{"text":"Best salsa I have ever had. The service is great. They're fast, on top of things, will explain the menu to you if you aren't familiar with traditional Mexican food, and it all tastes awesome. Best part, it's right on the edge of Tempe and Mesa so it's just off the 101. Be sure to check it out if you like southern Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a huge order for work - very nice people - nice atmosphere- I've lived around he corner for years and never knew of this place - thank u YELP!!  Plus they hooked me up with that salsa to go ;) u the bomb!  -updated from this point -  Got to the business and some stuff missing three burritos and sides of rice and beans -    Called to get what was missing and will keep you updated..   Last update:  came back and there was a misunderstanding with the employee who spoke purely Spanish -  but- not a problem the owner stepped in and gave me the missing rice and beans along with a complementary two carne asada burritos! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Home made chicken mole! Very authentic. No English. Cash only, otherwise would be 5 stars. Great hands made tortillas."}
{"text":"Came here because of the high rating. Was not disappointed. The little plaza looks shady and the inside of the restaurant is not the best, but stay for the food. Not your traditional Northern Mexico food, this is deep south Mexican food. The very pleasant \"Poblano\"  (dude from Puebla) explained the confusing menu and answered all questions. I had the quesadillas because homie highly recommended them. They were very tasty. I got one of each, Tinga, carne asada and chicharrón. I must say I didn't see much cheese in this quesadilla but it didn't matter since the entire plate was YUM. They were bathed in this delicious green sauce and the tortillas were hand made thick corn tortillas like my Nana used to make. Topped with lettuce and crumbled queso fresco. My co-worker got 3 carne asada tacos and he really enjoyed them. They have a tiny salsa bar with a killer burn your gut habanero salsa. Poblano gave us a fair warning on the heat. Must try it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic mexican food this place is it. Made from scratch dishes each morning that are to die for. Its a family from Puebla and everything they offer is excellent. The al pastor, carna asada, tinga da pollo, and carnitas are all perfect. However, the home made mole is the best. Has a nice thick consistency and a complex flavor that mixes chilis, chocolate, cinnamon and various other spices, not to mention the fact that it is served with homemade corn tortillas. The horchata is also fantastic. They have a few salsa offerings that are made in small batches daily."}
{"text":"Small place in a random shopping center in Mesa, but damn good food. Had a pastor burrito that was hearty and amazing. Their homemade sauces are all really good as well, and my girlfriends street tacos were good as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience and great homemade authentic Mexican food. Prices are very reasonable with lots and lots of tasty options. Wasn't sure if we'd feel out of place here, but the staff was friendly and service was excellent. Our server took the time to explain the menu and made recommendations for dishes. Plus for the homemade salsa varieties that offered a very hot habanero option that I really enjoy sometimes. The food came out fresh and hot and was cooked perfectly. This isn't a high dinning experience or refined cuisine, but it is fantastically good authentic food. This is a must try for everyone, and I look forward to returning to sample more of the menu.   Notes: This is a cash only restaurant. Soda is served by the can.   Two things your won't think twice about after your meal."}
{"text":"Sopas and sauces were excellent.  This the real deal in terms of southern Mexican food.  Service was excellent and the staff was super nice.  The prices are reasonable.  I will be back to try their mole!  The table next to me had it and if my Spanish hasn't  failed me they thought it was excellent!  Nice job guys.  Oh... no BYOB."}
{"text":"Recent dinner for 4.  Fortunately I speak \"menu Spanish\" as waitress did not speak English.  Mixed results.  The key factor here is that customers must be prepared for traditional preparation which could take a little longer in a very informal atmosphere.    Very good burrito, excellent \"al pastor\" taco; very good tamales.    I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant and I've been going here at least once a week for the last few years. Very friendly staff. The food is amazing. And there's a lot of things here that you won't find at Filiberto's or even Macayos. Very authentic dishes you can't get anywhere else. My favorites are the sopes and the tostada moreliana. If you love Mexican food, you will absolutely love this place. The Horchata and Jamaica is wonderful as well. And, they just added a dessert bar where you can get all kinds of ice cream, as well as strawberries and creme. Everyone I've ever brought here has loved it."}
{"text":"They give free chips and salsa!! The salsa they give is a green salsa. It's freaking delicious. Like one of the best salsas I've had from a restaurant. I got a green chile tamale, carne asada taco, and beans. The beans were great. It was a nice size portion too. They are creamy but not too thick, with a crumbly cheese on top. The green chile tamale was good. It wasn't very strong on the green chile, so you definitely get more of a masa taste. The tacos are street style, open faced. It tasted super fresh, and the meat was cooked well. My boyfriend got a cabeza taco, that was well done too. He also got 3 quesadillas. One spicy chicken, carne asada, and al pastor. They were all good. I liked the carne asada one the best. The chicken one wasn't super spicy, so if you have a low heat tolerance it's still perfect for you. All said and done it was $20 for all the food and a bottle of coke. That's awesome! They don't have a card tip option so if you so want to tip, bring some cash!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a good price. I went with a very picky eater. She grilled the owner and he took it like a champ. He proved he can turn out a high quality food to the toughest of critics. The refried beans and corn tortillas are made in house. Both are some of the best i have had. Give them a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.  Ok, I'd forgotten about this restaurant.  They moved a while ago from their SoScott location (that may have been in Tempe) on McKellips.  So I basically forgot about them.  I was searching for this restaurant on Yelp/Google after a discussion about my taste in MX food.  Come to find out, when Huauchinango reopened in the new location, the person that submitted this business page on Yelp spelled the name wrong!  So my search would turn up nothing on Google and Yelp.  I figured the resto was out of business.  Then like magic, another Yelper mentioned it in Yelp Talk.  I caught the misspell by a Yelper today and searched on that and bam... IN BUSINESS!  Yes, this is some really good food from a bonafide-hole-in-the-wall joint.  Makes me wanna do the happy dance when I used to eat their tamales.  So of course, after finding them in the search today, via a Yelper mention, I knew I had to go here tonight!  I'd waited for 2 years!    No tamales as they were out and would be making more for the next morning.  I will return soon for the tamales.  I'll stop in for lunch this time or, call ahead to make sure they have them.  So, no tamale tonight --- that's ok, I stuffed my face with a couple tacos.  I had the carnitas and the beef tongue tacos.  Both delicious and yummy.  I ordered chicken enchiladas for lunch tomorrow.   In true pig-out fashion, I took a bite of that and the enchiladas are far better than I remembered them being when they were on McKellips.  Just the right amount of salt-ness with enchilada sauce and cheese on top.  I top everything with something spicy.  their spicy habanero salsa adds the right amount of kick to it.  Also on my to have-again list from Huauchinango would be the mole (mo'lay).  I would easily give this play 5 stars if I could drink alcohol there and they don't  accept credit cards!!!  Oh Lord, please get the Square or something!  However, after I'm reminded how good the tamales are, I may come back for an update next week.  Stay tuned.  Oh Yeah... CASH ONLY."}
