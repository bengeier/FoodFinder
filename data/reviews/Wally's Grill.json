{"text":"This star is for service. Terrible service. Simple requests are always followed by a no. Which is unfortunate because the food is pretty good. Sorry Wally's I think the serving staff need to step up their game"}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price.  Local family friendly dinner.  A little bettrvthen the average grease spoon.  I come at least once a month for the foodcand friendly service"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places when i come to toronto - drive out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. I went on a Sunday and they were very busy we had to let them know we hadn't been seen yet. I've been back since and never had that problem again. Some of the staff is friendly others look so so. I would recommend it! A Rexdale classic!"}
{"text":"The portions were generous and our waitress friendly.  The pork souvlaki was the best we'd had in a long time. It's not a fancy place but it's clean and comfortable. We will be back"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this morning. Waited at the door to be seated and were told we could pick any table. A sign at the front would have been helpful. The prices are extremely affordable for breakfast and quality was great. Service was a little slow but the restaurant was busy. They have standard breakfast fare. I would return for a cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Wallys for breakfast as we were in the area. I used to frequent this place back in the day at the old location. I remember the food as being amazing and with that \"homemade\" feel. Sadly, that's no longer the case. Food is average at best, prices are okay for what you get. The waitress we had was horrible, very unattentive and unhelpful when we had questions about the menu. Oh and as for the number of eggs you can get with your breakfast, it's 1 or 3, 2 isn't an option unless you want to pay more. So long Wally's ..... It was good while it lasted"}
{"text":"Firstly when I sat down the server did not bring me a menu I was forced to share with the person beside me. 

Secondly, the breakfast here is good but I decided to try something else on the menu and went with what the server described to be a roast beef dip sandwich. Turns out it was roast beef and gravy put on top 1 slice of thick white toast with some old vegetables on the side. No sandwich, no beef broth dip, gross gravy and the server did not come and ask if everything was ok until everyone else at the table was done eating."}
{"text":"Been dining here on many occasions over the years so more of a general review really.  Very nice and homely ambiance; we always love it when we are seated in a booth.  When the sun shines in on a glorious afternoon, nothing warms your heart more.  Nice menu variety from breakfast specials to a full range of entrees like soups, sandwiches, pasta and steak.  We always order from the breakfast menu, whether it's the 2-egg specials, 3-egg omelettes or pancakes or French toast as part of combos.  Very nice portions, especially the buttered toast and home fries.  Unlimited coffee refills can do no wrong.  Always a winner with breakfast food!

My only comment is it's slightly pricey with the more elaborate breakfast specials, more so than the average breakfast restaurant...but a bit justified as you're supporting a local mom 'n pop eatery.  Also, we've noticed that customer service used to be stellar and has somewhat diminished over the years...they're not as quick and responsive as they used to be...but we have our all-time fav blonde-haired, bespectacled super friendly waitress who is always fantastic!  Glad Wally's is in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Not a bad breakfast/lunch spot. Great soup, good burgers. I could do without the Greek seasoning on the meat, but the burger was cooked right, and they load you up on the toppings."}
{"text":"The quality of service offered up by the woman who answered the phone was sub par at best and the food even worse. I ordered bacon, eggs, and hash for 5+ coworkers, HR, and my district manager and no one finished what they received. Upon opening my container I was immediately turned off by the appearance of the \"hash\". It looked like boiled potatoes, half mashed and thrown atop the flat top for a few seconds. Everyone kept saying that the food tasted old and the bread was stale. No plan to ever return. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Good little old fashioned diner with big portions...have enjoyed their daily specials including their chicken salad sandwich which was really good, lots of flavour as well as their hot beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always have, and always will. It's the perfect go-to for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The staff is super friendly, the meals are homemade and hardy, leaving you full for the day. The prices are super reasonable. Everyone I take here always insists we go back again. 

This time around I had their classic cheese burger. The burger was perfectly made, just like you'd get at a family barbecue. Their fries are heavenly. 

I always go when I need a good pick me up breakfast too, and it's super convenient that the breakfast menu is available all day.

I give this place ten stars!"}
{"text":"I just love diner fare and Wally's really delivered. This place is probably the best in the area for breakfast all day or just about anything you'd expect to find in a typical diner."}
{"text":"Wally's Grill is this small restaurant that looks like a diner on the inside, while also serving up some trucker diner food including Greek options, deli sandwiches, and all day breakfast. The place itself looks pretty old school with clientele old enough to match. Servers are friendly and you'll find something for everyone here so it's a safe place to grab lunch with picky coworkers.

I grabbed up a Reuben sandwich while the coworker ordered a burger. The Rueben had thin slices of corned beef with partially cooked swiss cheese that was sandwiched between some pretty greasy bread and served with your choice of side (fries....it's always fries). As soon as you pick up the bread, the grease just stains your fingertips and you can't put it down. The sauerkrat was real wet so it made the bottom slice a bit tough to handle, but the meat stacked fairly nicely. The corned beef was decent enough as it wasn't overly salty. Fries were actually pretty good even though I'm sure they were probably store bought.

Would come again if not for the convenience. It's located right by the library, but otherwise it's a spot that you easily drive by without giving a second notice to. The All-Day breakfast menu looks pretty good with a nice mix of pancakes, omelettes, and breakfast sandwiches. Will probably give that a go next time around."}
{"text":"I 've been here a handful if times and never been dissapointed. Portions are decent .staff is friendly. My go to item is the eggs Benedict , you cant go wrong .Also i recommended the meat lovers omelet ."}
{"text":"This place has the best Reuben sandwich that I have found in Toronto. I always remember it piled with meat and dripping tantalizingly, I crave this sandwich when I haven't had it in a while. The pickles are excellent as well, make sure to order some extra. You have to be willing to give up salt for the rest of the day though (or for a few days) as it's got more than its share. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast in the area it gets points for me for having baked beans which every breakfast place should have and dosnt."}
