{"text":"They have a pretty good selection of food to pick from - I was surprised to learn they also have breakfast here which you can't find in this small town! The only disappointing thing is that they don't have a website or menu posted anywhere online. I'd like to change that by adding a picture of their full menu here so people can reference this! For the prices, you get a good amount of food, especially for breakfast. The inside looks pretty run down (not dirty, just needs updated) but the employees seem very nice. If you're in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very good hoagie and calzone.  Food was ready for pick up when ordered.  Well priced and big portions.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Pizza Capri is good stuff. Family owned and operated, or at least was when I left the burgh a year ago. There was so many shops that delivered to where I lived, it took me awhile to get some Pizza Capri. They are Carryout only,  just a counter when you walk in and dinner only. My favorite pie from Pizza Capri is the double pepperoni, well done, nice and crispy, perfect. Worth that 6 minute drive from Oakdale. haha"}
