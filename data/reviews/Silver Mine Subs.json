{"text":"I finally decided to give this place a try. Even though I occasionally walked by the place after class, I couldn't find the urge to go in. When a 12 PM class ended earlier than planned, I went to Silver Mine Subs with a friend for lunch. The place seemed clean and the workers were friendly. I had the California Gulch on wheat and my friend had the Steam Engine. I paid about $8.00 for the large, which was said to be 11\". The ingredients in general seemed fresher than other fast food restaurants but it could be my biased opinion. For the particular California Gulch, it included tuna salad, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and sprouts with the addition of banana peppers and jalepanos, The additional ingredients were free. I thought the tuna salad had too much sauce in it but the bread was soft and fluffy. The sandwich overall had a clean taste."}
{"text":"First time visit to this sub shop.  It's about a half mile from my new office, so I had to try it out my first week.  I ordered a customized Georgetown sub.  It was a sad little sub. There was literally one thin slice of turkey deli meat on the sandwich, with a tiny sliver of cheese, tasteless bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado paste.  Definitely not a quality sandwich or satisfying meal.  This place gets credit for easy online ordering and delivery until 3am.  But honestly, if I'm hungry in middle of the night, I'm quite certain I would not order from this place!"}
{"text":"Consistently good subs. We order from them a few times a week, and have never had a SINGLE incorrect order. They're always on the ball. We're at the edge of their delivery range, and orders rarely take more than 30-45 minutes to arrive. We've never gotten sick after eating anything either. Make sure to order the bbq Pop Chips! Definitely worth a try. As far as the subs go, you can't go wrong. I haven't eaten a bad one. And they're original enough that you dont get bored, while also not being so out there, you wouldn't want more than one type of sub. I've tried most of the ones on the menu!
I can't speak about in store quality, as I've never been in there. We always get Silvermine delivered. Also, after ~12am, thy're one of the few places that still deliver (till 3am)!"}
{"text":"I order from Silver Mine Subs Arizona on a weekly basis and besides having great food, the staff is awesome, they're always really quick with their deliveries and if there are ever any issues they make an honest effort to resolve the issue. That is why I order from them almost every week. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"So I got an message from Ken the same day I posted this review. He apologized and said \"I could definitely put a free medium sub credit on your account and encourage you to try us again?  Thank you for the feedback!\"

I responding telling him I would try again today.... I guess I will update again later.

Once I got over the fact that a hot sub would not be hot (its warm), and the size is not the same as most sub shops. It wasn't great, but it wasnt bad. So I will upgrade it to three stars. 
I have to admit that some of the options are a nice change of pace from the usual places I order for lunch. Hopefully they can make some changes in the future."}
{"text":"WORST CHEESESTEAK EVER! 

Note that you cannot get it without Onions or Green Peppers because, and I quote, \"it's mixed in.\" Um, OK. So, I took a shot. What I got was a cold roll with some sweet tasting, room temperature, pressed meat in it, mashed up with some Onions or Green Peppers, topped with no cheese that was apparent to the naked eye (or could be tasted), and some shredded lettuce and tomatoes. By comparison, the Steak-Um product that you can get in your grocer's freezer section is FINE DINING. 

STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We never throw away food, and this went straight into the trash in favor of frozen burritos.... UGH!"}
{"text":"Yes I would tell as many people as I can about this place.. they are good even though I was gipped out of some avocado. But they did redo my order. So yes would come back and let as many know about this place. Thank to the store for the redo. :-)"}
{"text":"Their bread is always dry, and their sandwiches never seem as fresh as they really should be. Other locations do much better than this one, it's a shame really."}
{"text":"They have very quick delivery service in Tempe. Whenever I order they knock on my door 15 minutes later. I love love love their Dodge City."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great... Good place to go late-night when nothing else is open.  For a good sub, I prefer Jimmy Johns for sure."}
{"text":"So much better for delivery in the area than Genos! Quick, accurate orders with friendly delivery personnel."}
{"text":"The box lunch is not a box lunch. We ordered two subs that were listed as having a sub, pickle spear, and a cookie included. We received two subs and four packs of the wrong chips. I love their subs but was disappointed by their false advertising."}
{"text":"These guys make a pretty good sub.  I'll stop here long before I hit Subway or Blimpie.  I first found this place in Colorado.  I could swear it's the same guys working at this location.  Very laid back.  It's like some of your buddies are making a sub for you.  Of course, they're not really your buddies...anyway, good subs."}
{"text":"It is an independent place, which I normally like to support, but I was not just not impressed when I went there.  It seemed kind of pricey for what you got, and there are a lot of other, better sandwich places around."}
{"text":"I've only been once and can't comment on the other sandwiches, but the Cour d'Alene hot sandwich is awful.

The \"roast beef\" is essentially dog food: it's shredded and bathed in a strange tasting sauce that my white bread wouldn't absorb. Unfortunately, the sauce is necessary: the meat crumbles and falls everywhere without the goop holding it together. Regrettably, it tastes like it looks.

Otherwise, the white bread was good: buttery, but not too rich, and the au ju had a nice flavor, but the shredded meat paste was just too much.

I won't say don't go to Silver Mine at all. The cold subs look promising, but skip the Cour d'Alene at all costs. 

(If you are really in the mood for a processed meat product, head over to State Street Brats and pick up the chicken wings.)"}
{"text":"I've had two subs from here. The Italian sub, and I can't recall the other. Nothing special in my book. Overpriced. Bread is OK. Just another sub shop with a catchy name and a weird menu. Quick service. It is clean and easy to get to. Doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Bad location, but I could care less since I only order delivery from here late at night.  And oh my god, it tastes soo good.  The equation for the tastiness goes something like this...
Y = T*x^2
where T is a function of how late it is,
Y is the Yum factor,
and x...I don't know what x is, but it kind of spells \"tax...\"

Price is okay - delivery total is a few dollars more than what I usually pay for something like Gumby's with haxxor deals - and a bit higher than what you could get at Subway for $5 (but not as customizable).  However, they're open late, and some of their pre-mades, like the Cripple Creek are just too good to pass up.  Double 11-in. sub special is their best offer."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have fresh meat even though I don't eat meat but this place good. I love that they have soo many topping and can make their wraps and sandwichs vegan upon request. This place is very clean and friendly. They are open till 3 am and deliver. They also have the option of ordering online for pick up or deliveery."}
{"text":"Just ordered from Silver Mine Subs.  Despite ordering online so they would have perfect information order still was delivered over an hour later do to going to the wrong address.  Driver didn't care as he already had the tip from the order online. Just said \"Sorry bud\" in a bored voice.  Hot food is cold now as well, NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"It's decent sub shop. Personally I like it better than Subway and Quiznos. I never remember which sub I get, so it's always something different. All in all, pretty decent. Kinda pricey though, but it's open really late. So that helps it's case."}
{"text":"I love this place. If I ever visit scottsdale i will be returning to this sub shop. The staff is very friendly, the food is great and they are open late."}
{"text":"Six words can summarize it nicely: consistent, fast, clean, and friendly staff.

Silver Mine has provided great staple sandwiches on many a busy day or during some of my innumerable home improvement fiascoes that result in hundreds of trips to numerous stores. They've never doled out rotten rabbit food (old or brown vegetables), rancid meat, the place is always clean, the staff have always been friendly, and the price is good."}
{"text":"I placed an order online through their website. After an hour I called to see where my order was. They said that it didn't come trough the fax. They finally got my order and said it would be here shortly. After another full hour (2 hours!!!!) of waiting I called back. They said the person was on the road with it. I said I wouldn't order delivery from them again and the manager had the nerve to say \"that's ok I don't mind\"!!!! Seriously work on your customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Great bread, much better than Subway and slightly better than Jimmy John's. The sandwich selection is great. The only downside is the wait time. When it is slow it can take 5 minutes plus to get a sandwich. It seems they are severely understaffed. Also when we have had it delivered it has take an hour plus. So if you go there make sure to go after 5 for 5 dollar large subs or small combos and use their coupons as well."}
{"text":"Good sammiches and REALLY GOOD CHILI!!
Gotta love a place that delivers until 3am, can always rely on Silver Mine"}
{"text":"Yummy and reasonably priced subs. Better than going to Subway."}
{"text":"Nurses working overnight ordered subs 2.5 hours ago... still not here. Called multiple times and was told that they were out for delivery. Never came, and they're closed so now so now we lost $ . This also happened to a fellow coworker a few weeks ago and the managers heavily resisted refund despite 3+ hour wait time for 3 subs. Do not order delivery. Now these nurses will go hungry during their night shift."}
{"text":"Decent subs, but nothing to get all excited about.  Average ingredients, decent prices.  

They have a handful of different combinations on their menu which I can appreciate."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I am not normally a sandwich kind of girl, but when I get the craving for a sandwich, Silver Mine is the place I go!

I first had Silver Mine back in my ASU days, we couldn't believe that we could get delivery until 3:00 am for something other than pizza, so we were hooked!  The bread is what really makes the sandwiches so good, it is way better than Subways or Blimpies, it soft on the inside and bit crispy on the outside!  The meats and cheeses that they use are really fresh, and they have sprouts!  They also have really good broccoli cheese soup and an array of hot sandwiches too!

They staff is really nice, and even though this location is not near ASU they still will deliver to my house until 3:00 am!"}
{"text":"the bread is awful. The service is spotty. Sometimes fantastic. Sometimes just really ok. I don't want to slam them entirely, I get the nature of the job is not always ideal and they probably have to deal with a lot of annoying people. I think having a tighter run crew would benefit them in the long run."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place in-town. Love the Frontier. My only complaint is that there isn't one on the far westside."}
{"text":"I like the subs at this place, and they deliver!  I like Subway but the location at Miller and Indian School is pretty bad."}
{"text":"I take Silvermine for what it is, because it's one of the better options for delivery, especially late at night. Most of the time, the sandwiches are not bad. I live closer to the Silver Mine Subs on Mill and they always deliver within their quoted timeframe. They forget crackers to my soup, utensils, or napkins quite frequently, but always on time.

I'm closer to this Silver Mine for work, so I've ordered here a few times. For the third time in a row, they deliver my food 50-70 minutes after I order it, and always quote me 30-40 minutes. I understand if you're busy, but just be honest with the time, guys. If I'm waiting that long for a sandwich, it's not worth it. 

I've ordered here for the last time, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Standing at counter for 10 minutes while 2 associates carried on a conversation and 1 associate walked passed me and did not offer assistance.  Very poor customer service tonight. Language not appropriate either."}
{"text":"There subs are pretty good.  Tey don't take forever to deliver.  Reasonably priced. And my favorite thing about Silver Mine is they deliver until  3am."}
{"text":"I had 7 past deliveries from Silver Mine and now I'm out of their range.... When I call and ask where my food is an hour later, the phone girl rudely states that I'm out of range and can have a pickup order if I would like.  If I wanted to drive and get food, I would go somewhere with much better food than Silvermine Subs, the only reason I order from you is your delivery service so I see no reason to continue patronizing your business.  Thanks for the crappy sandwiches!!!!!  (apparently they did call from a number that wasn't their listed # to try to tell me they wouldn't take the delivery, but when I called said # nobody answered so how was I to know?)"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to Tempe about a month or so ago and was immediately on the search for a new sandwich place (considering my favorite from my old city was only located there). I had heard a lot about places like Jimmy Johns, and have both a Subway and Cheba Hut right next to my place, and I tried just about everything before I got to Silver Mine---I wish I would have tried them first!
Their subs are REALLY good. My two favorites are Dodge City and Cripple Creek. They are really easy to order from, as you can go into the store, call them, or even order online for pickup or delivery. I usually have them deliver and they're always super quick---usually 15-20 minutes tops when they give you the estimate time of 30 minutes. Not only that, but they deliver until 3 AM which is perfect for Tempe considering it's a generally young crowd who are up late and partying and get those late night munchies. 
They are a little pricier than some other places but they always have coupons and deals for you while most other places don't offer this. Even with slightly higher prices, I think they're totally worth it. I'm a 100% Silver Mine fan now. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The clock struck 12:30AM and I was distraught with hunger. Through the gleaming light of the internet, GrubHub showed me Silver Mine Subs, which was surprisingly still open. I checked out several other Yelp reviews, some of which were one or two stars, and I reluctantly ordered. My ETA for delivery was around 1:30AM, which is quite standard with most delivery places online. So, when the doorbell rang at around 1:00AM, I was quite surprised to see the delivery man! All in all, I had an amazing experience with Silver Mine Subs, and I will definitely be ordering again. Food/Review Break-Down:

Menu/Variety: Quite a wide variety of options, there's something for everyone. 5/5

Delivery Speed: Quicker than expected! Now, it was during the middle of the night, so I can't speak for how they are throughout a busy day. 5/5

Cheese steak: Phenomenal. As others have mentioned, Silver Mine uses VERY soft rolls. Which, if you're from the East Coast like I am, you will appreciate. I personally like a soft roll, but I can see how others wouldn't. This sandwich in particular uses Pepper jack cheese, which I've never had on a cheese steak before. It was a pleasant surprise, and added just enough spice to the sandwich. There was a generous amount of steak on there as well, which most sub places will skimp on. The steak wasn't amazing or anything, tasted pretty ordinary, but it was definitely packed on there. I ordered this without onions or green peppers, and had no problem getting just the meat and cheese. Pretty decently sized for the price. 5/5

Bowl of Chili: Good chili! They give you a pretty decent amount and you have the option or bread or crackers. I ordered mine with crackers, which were oyster style. I don't eat chili much, but this was pretty flavorful in my book. 4/5

Brownie: NOM. It's a \"chocolate chunk\" style brownie, and boy is it good. Very soft and chewy. It's pretty decently sized, I'd say it's the perfect serving for one person. if you order for two people, I'd recommend ordering one for each of you, unless you want to share. Which, with this brownie, you sure don't. 5/5"}
{"text":"It's becoming quite ridiculous with the new ownership of this place.  I have now ordered here 3 times since they re-opened and each time there were issues with the order.  The first time after ordering online and waiting for an hour, I proceeded to call them in which I was told that they had no such orders despite my card being charged.  The second time along with tonight's third order, were also made online.  Just out of good measure, we decided both times to call about 5 minutes after ordering to ensure their systems were working.  Both times they said they received the order....yet both orders took close to 1.5 hours to complete.  Mind you, we literally live less than a mile away from the place and I'm sure it takes less than 5 minutes to make a sandwich.  The owner of this place needs to figure out the right people to hire because now each time I have gone in to discuss these scenarios, I am not even given a simple apology for the issues.  They simply scramble to make the sub par sandwich due to them now rushing and offer no such apology or try to right the situation.  Truly disappointed in this place as we were looking forward to them opening back up due to the close location."}
{"text":"Best sub shop in phoenix bar none. You know that really big national chain of sub shops? After eating at silvermine that place will taste like garbage. And that place that delivers really fast? Taste like paper compared to the delicious subs at silvermine that deliver into the crazy hours of your insomniac life! The cripple creek is a staple. Don't forget the other one-with like turkey and bacon and guac. Forget the name because who cares PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND LIVE LIFE BEYOND THE STATUS QUO"}
{"text":"Slow delivery and no Boxed Lunch combos make me really regret moving just outside the downtown location's delivery zone.  I just want a crappy sandwich and cookie before hitting the sack after a tipsy evening out."}
{"text":"I go to the location on Indian School and Granite Reef Rd. and I love it! It doesn't matter if you go at 1:00 in the afternoon or 1:00 in the morning it is always fresh. I love that they are open till 3am! I like the Caribou myself   but  have also tried the Comstock and Dodge City and they are also very good.  I think the best part is the bread because it is soft and chewy. Check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and decided to find a place that delivers. Found this place on Yelp and read some decent reviews, looked over their menu, and finally decided to give it a shot.

Not impressed. The advised delivery time per my order confirmation wasroughly 45 minutes after the order has been placed. I personally thought that was quite a wait for a sub given that pizza joints deliver in less time. Figured that I'd still give it a shot since it was my first time trying this place. My order (a medium \"Homestake\" hot-sub, a small soda, and chips) took well over an hour to arrive after placing my order. I didn't expect my order to be \"fresh out of the oven\" hot, but at the same time I wasn't expecting it to be as cold as it was. Also, the soda that I ordered was watered down quite a bit - still drinkable, but barely. To rate the sub itself - meh, definitely had way better for a comparable price. It tasted a bit bland and the quality just didn't seem to fit the price. Better than Subway? THAT was hard to tell from this first experience, but that's where I would compare this place too.

Overall, the food wasn't outright horrible, but it's not something that I would rave or spread the news about. I'd give this place another try, however I'll probably skip the delivery service (unless I'm starving between 1-3am - surprised they deliver that late) and try a different item on their menu. In the meantime, Jimmy John's and Jersey Mike's are going to sustain my sub cravings."}
{"text":"Silver Mine is always pretty good.  
Great sandwiches.
Delicious soups.
Late night delivery..what's not to like???  Try their pickles.  
I don't know what brand they are but they are really good!!!"}
{"text":"Worst ever! Nothing is fresh, they cant read specific instructions and corporate doesnt even care. We called to complain, left a message asking them to call us back (left our number) and never got a call back. The subs were thrown together with out care. Not even worth using the bucky book coupon. Total disappointment!"}
{"text":"The subs are okay. Both times I've been in here the staff looks like they just got through smoking the hippy lettuce in the back. The only real bright spot are their brownies."}
{"text":"This place apparently only has stoners working for them. Not only have they screwed up our orders numerous times, but they do little to remedy the fact that they overcharged for food items completely left off the order. I received a veggie sandwich with lettuce, sprouts and tomatoes and was charged over $9 for a sandwich that, according to the receipt, should have every veggie known to man on it. Dude, it's sandwich, not rocket science. Get it together."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, and they deliver! I like the different sizes of the sandwiches, sometimes I want more than 6 inches but not a foot long. SO much better than the typical fast food sub joint and a fair amount of choices for us vege-ma-tarians."}
{"text":"Checked this place out because we had some coupons. My boyfriend and I ordered a cripple creek and a buffalo chicken sandwich both on wheat. Both were supposed to be hot. We got home and neither were hot (we live less than 2 miles away.. I expected at very least mildly warm) and both were on white bread. My sandwich also came without bacon like noted. The sandwich was decent but with so many things wrong with our order I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Gross late night subs delivered by a nice sketchy crew of degenerates. The meatball sub is made with tasty frozen meatballs from the store, and they taste like shit. Cookies are prepackaged and are probably from 2005. Delivery can take a long long time, and don't expect change from your driver. Late night dining needs to be better than this."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. I'm not a pizza fan so late at night I will get a sub. so some times my food will take forever to get here and it ends up being soggy and not very good. but when it gets here on time it's good food. so not a lot of complaints."}
{"text":"I ordered delievery yesterday, when I called and placed the order I asked it there was a \"combo\" option and was told yes, so I got chips and a coke. I was told it came at one price, I then added two cookies and hung up the phone, About 20 minutes later my food arrived with a total of $16.80 due for one sandwich \"combo\", and two cookies. I understand there will typically be a delievery charge, but it is typically mentioned upon ordering. Also, it is typically mentioned if everything is charged seperately to add up to a RIDICULOUS total. I tipped generously and thanked the man. I then reading the reciept and ate my meal. All tasted good, but I when saw my reciept on the bag and was outraged. I went to the store the following afternoon (today) and was treated poorly by the cashier who offered nothing but a \"free delivery\" coupon, worth $2. He would not offer me a sandwich or any other form of compensation after I even requested he do so. His reasoning being that, they only offer a combo for dine in customers, Had that been said on the phone upon ordering there would be no issue at all. After rudely arguing with me I got no where and told him they just lost a repeat customer and left. Customer service seriously needs improvment between the young man with gages at the cash register as well as JD who took my order. Very dissapointed. I have never had this issue with you guys. Guess Jimmy Johns is my new go to!"}
{"text":"Gross! my warm sandwich was cold, no meat Cold cheese, cold veggies...hardly a cheesesteak. Didn't even ask if we wanted anything else on it. I will not be returning. gross."}
{"text":"Place was shut down by health department AND owner disappeared without paying their employees.  This is a Franchise, I called corporate and they blew me off.  Silver Mine Subs is a disgrace!"}
{"text":"Whether you got home from a late night or just want a great sandwich for lunch Silver Mine is the place to go.  They are not only open late, they also deliver till 3 a.m. and have a great staff.  The bread and the selection of sandwiches make this a great sandwich stop!!!"}
{"text":"The 3415 S McClintock Dr. location looks to be closed. Stopped by last Saturday afternoon (3-21-15) and again this evening (3-23-15)-- closed. Two weeks ago Saturday (3-14) they had \"just opened\" at 1 pm. Really liked the product. Too bad if they are out of business. Hope the owner/operator is okay."}
{"text":"They deliver.  They're open late.  The subs are decent, but nothing too special.  I eat here for the convenience when I'm feeling too lazy to make my own sandwich at home.  Other neighborhood sub places are better, but further from my house."}
{"text":"I had to drop by the university bookstore during my lunch break so thought I'd just grab a sub while I was nearby. Excellent decision. The place was clean, the employees were helpful, and the sandwich I got, while not terribly cheap, was well worth the price. It was much more filling than the sandwiches I like at Subway; quality meat, plenty of it, fresh toppings, nice bread. Couldn't really ask for more. I'll be back the next time I'm on that side of campus for lunch."}
{"text":"Hour and half for a delivery. I don't care how good the subs are, that is horrible. I will be ordering from jimmy johns from now on."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love this place for subs. I'd rather have this at 2am than Filiberto's (YUCK!!)."}
{"text":"I've never liked going here, pretty terrible food and service. I actually know some of the people who used to work here, and they aren't exactly in a clear mind when they clock in. Once there were gnats flying around my food, pretty off-putting. I wouldn't go here again unless i had to. If you do like the food and get past all the bad things, try the mother load. Least terrible thing on the menu- they pretty much just throw everything they can into that sandwich."}
{"text":"In total loser fashion... I decided to order some delivery from here. A large Corde De Lane... Is that spelled right? lol... Pretty much its a French Dip Sandwich. They took a lot faster than I thought they would - less than 30 minutes. yay!

The beef was very tender and thinly sliced. The provolone cheese that I ordered to go with it was way yummy too! My only complaint was that the aju was a little too salty. I also would like it if they actually had sized that made sense... who wants an 8\" or 11\" sub?? How about 6 or 12 inch sub?! 

The food was yummy and I'll definatly be ordering from them again! Especially considering they are open all hours of the night and deliver until 3! :D whoo hoo!!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients at Quality prices.  Friendly staff and some of the tastiest subs you will ever find at a sub shop.  After eating here you will have had your last subway trip.  The hours are incredible as well as the delivery service.   I would recommend Silver Mine to all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick afternoon bite and was pleased. Some good sub options, although nothing overly creative. However, fast, fresh, and vastly preferable to Subway. Free wi-fi made it a great place to sit for a bit, do a little email, and grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"I've never personally gone in to the shop. So I can't speak of how clean it is or isn't. It's a college town. It's Mill. This place delivers late and it's surely better than fillibertos. Delivery can take some time depending on the night. Reasonable prices I'd say standard considering you get more meat. Great tasting subs for a great price on a night you don't want to drive!"}
{"text":"The WORST customer service I've ever had. Pretty much just a bunch of stoner kids that cant do simple math n throwing items at u when u ask for something"}
{"text":"if you're into bread that is chewy silvermine is the best. smoke out the driver and they will bring you brownies...but don't say you will and then forget to b/ you are too drunk. and try not to barter with bjs, b/ then they will not even come and pretend to not remember you when you call the next morning demanding your subs and brownies sans d-s'ing free of charge. lots of lesbians work here too..I'm assuming only the ones that are into chewy bread though.."}
{"text":"This place is my staple for a sandwich when I am hungry. I will admit the fact I can get a delivery at 2:00 am has been a perk at times. I get a nice consistent sandwich every time."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place!  A few years ago when I worked at Sky Harbor, they were one of a VERY few places that would actually deliver to airport businesses, so that was awesome.

When not working and stumbling along Mill, you can't go wrong here.  The staff will laugh at your drunk ass, but put up with you reasonably well.  A few seats outside and a bunch more inside. Shitty parking if it's late on a weekend, but if you're picking up (what I had to do as I personally lived outside the delivery area) you might luck out and catch a spot as a delivery driver is leaving.

I still have my punch card (only needs one more  til my free sub!) for the next time I'm in town...I only hope they still take them whenever the hell that  is!"}
{"text":"Garbage. Food poisoning, sick for days after eating a philly. Disappointed to say the least. Need some quality control in this place, get it right. Should be reported. Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"So, I just called Silvermine Subs on Mcclintock and they asked me for my information... After giving them my crossroads the extremely rude Arab employee said in the little english that he knew \"call another Silvermine's\" and hung up before I could respond.  I immediately called back and asked to speak with his manager, he laughed and hung up on me again!!  I had my boyfriend call back on his phone and he asked for a manager... the arab guy said he was the manager, so my boyfriend handed me the phone... I obviously knew he was lying, so I told him to give the phone to the manager... he laughed, AGAIN and said we're busy right now and hung up.  I plan on going to that location tomorrow and talking to the manager about how that was the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced by far, and that employee should have serious repercussions if not fired... By the way, I called the Mill location right after and they were EXTREMELY nice and well mannered... DO NOT EVER go to the Southern and Mcclintock location. TERRRRIBLE!

I wish i could give this review ZERO stars, one is about ten times more than it deserves."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches!  The meatball is as good as it gets.  They have kids meals and a clean place to eat with the family.  Fast, good,  affordable.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the subs from here. I regularly go out of my way to get my lunch from here at least once a week. The caribou is my favorite of the subs, the soup is delicious and 99.9% of the employees are super friendly. Also, they have great deals. I definitely will recommend Silver Mines to my friends and family! :-)"}
{"text":"Ok... Here we go... Bread? Awful. Meats? Horrible. Service? Non-existent. WHY ARE THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS?!?!?!?! Late night delivery.

THAT IS IT. I have ordered from here a ton of times and every time is the same... Late night but disgusting... Last night was the last straw... It is the worst sub shop in Madison. 

That is all."}
{"text":"We brought our soccer team up for a match.  We were able to coordinate ahead of time and each and every order was perfect.  The staff was great.  The delivery was on time.  Next time we are up that direction we will use them again!"}
{"text":"Great subs - super fast, super convenient hours. The staff is always really friendly."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. Always a greeting as you walk in. Fast and delicious. I suggest their buffalo chicken wrap and their big pickles. Will continue to order from here regularly."}
{"text":"Silvermine subs used to be one of my favorite sub places. They started going downhill a couple years ago and stopped eating it. The other night I was craving it so we ordered a couple sandwiches. I wish we would have saved our money. Both sandwiches we order were soo bad we threw them away. We tried calling after we got our order but since we ordered really late, they must have been closed by the time we got our food. We ordered a criplecreek which is supposed to be one of their hot sandwiches.... It was cold. And when I mean cold, I mean the chicken was almost frozen. Bread was cold. They didn't even put bacon on the sandwich like it's supposed to have. We also ordered a caribou. I added mustard to it as well. There was soo much mustard and avacodo on it that it was soggy and gross. Both sandwiches went into the trash. Too bad. Silvermine used to be good."}
{"text":"Silermine is a chain, but has the feel of a mom and pop. They've created a laid back culture that's somehow worked its way in to every location I've visited. And by \"laid back,\" I don't mean the employees are lazy or slow. I highly recommend the Cripple Creek and Homesteak."}
{"text":"I have just added another sub place to my list of favorite sub places. I went here for the first time last night after discovering it even existed the other day. I came in after 7pm, I was goofing off, and there was only one other customer there and the one employee was making his sandwich. That gave me a chance to look over the menu. Now for me my acid test for a sub place is an Italian sub. Turkey is pretty easy and so is ham or roast beef etc. But you can mess up an Italian sub. For an example of a bad Italian sub see the place a few doors down from here but that is another review.
They have 3 sizes like most places. 5, 8 and 11 inch. Funny that it isn't 12 but hats off to them for admitting it is only 11 instead of trying to pass it off as 12. After a few minutes the other customers sandwich was made so it was my turn. \"What can I do for you boss?\" Ut oh a \"boss\" guy. Some people have a pet peeve about this I could care less. I went for the large 11 inch sub, figured it is dinner time let's go for it, and a large drink. Besides asking for it on wheat bread, a taste thing I'm not fooling myself into thinking that that makes it healthy somehow, I had it just the way it comes nothing special or extra. I like to see how they do it. Now they don't slice it up right in front of you and you can't really see them make it but he did have to put it together so you know it is not all pre made to where they just slap it in the roll and it is done. Only took a minute or so and it was ready to go. One minor thing, no pun intended, he did forget to give me the cup for my soda but I reminded him, he apologized and handed me a cup right away. No big deal.
I took the sandwich home and that thing was good from bite one. Packed with meat and toppings. Great flavor. I will say from now on I will stick with the medium the large was just too much for me. Which is a good thing.
I know it is a chain and not local but they are a small chain. They are only in five states with most of the locations here and in Colorado. I will definitely be back and work my way through the rest of the menu. Sure they aren't $5 foot longs but it is very much worth the small extra cost. Plus they deliver and are open until 3am. So they have you covered for those late night drunken cravings. Future visits could bump it up to 5 stars. Serving Coke Zero on the fountain could help that.

On a side note, I know it has nothing to do with this place but it needs mentioning, there is a Mexican place next door to this place. Don't go there. Their food is horrible. See my other review of that place. I love mom and pop place and Mexican food but his place is horrible."}
{"text":"This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered.

Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time. 

Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My \"hot sub\" is ice cold, there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.

This place probably has a \"good taste potential\". Unfortunately, like most \"hot food\" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!"}
{"text":"We love everything we have ever ordered from here. Love the broccoli cheddar soup and the bread is amazing! They are open really late and deliver all night too! I usually order the California Gulch (Tuna) and my boyfriend switches between the King Bullion (Ham and Turkey) or the Steam Roller (Meatball). The staff is awesome here. Mostly only see them when they deliver and when they take our order over the phone but they are great every time. My only wish is that they would improve their app."}
{"text":"This place isn't that bad, in fact I like the bread choice, whole wheat, white, maybe even a sub style. They have three different size meal options (small, medium, large) which I find is beneficial. 

Over not bad, but the staff could use a lesson in customer service (they seem high all the time I go in there)"}
{"text":"Silver Mine Subs is the only decent casual sandwich place in Madison.
Their ingredients are always so fresh. One thing I love is that the onions are crispy red onion, not yellow slimey onions. 
Their prices are affordable - $7 for a full small meal, which is tough to come by at any fast casual place.
Plus, they're open super late. Not many places on the west side are open until 3 am, even pizza places aren't."}
{"text":"Good stuff! They have a nice selection of sandwiches and deliver until 3AM! Yay! I like the Tombstone or Comstock, and sometimes get it in a wrap. Their service has been consistently good over the years. Good quality ingredients, a step up from Subway."}
{"text":"I ordered my sub to be delivered at 12:15 for lunch came an hour early and cold.  If they can't read or follow simple instructions that are set in place as options to chose its not worth it.  Many better places to order subs from."}
{"text":"This was the worst food experience I have had in years. A $30 deli lunch for two should be great, yet the meat (chicken and steak) was processed garbage, the onions and tomatoes wet not fresh and the soup was a gelatinous mess. I have literally had better food at Subway and spent less than half of what I did at this place"}
{"text":"It was my first time at the sub shop and it was amazing. Loaded sandwiches and nice people in in the rush hour or lunch time. Melted in my mouth. Must go here...."}
{"text":"No stars. I called to order food during open business hours and they told me they were closed because they were understaffed?!? Seriously? I'm a nurse and we are understaffed everyday! Figure it out. Get it done. No excuses. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"3 stars for service. 5 stars for service when the girls are working (like they were the other day- called in my order and it was done when I got there 5 minutes later). 

I LOVE their bread. LOVE IT. And I get the turkey/avocado/bacon/ranch sub every time and never get tired of it. 

I'd give it 5 stars if the guys were a little better and if the broccoli cheese soup tasted the same every time. Every now and then it tastes just like pure fake cheese, but usually is delicious.

I bought the max deal chickens (like groupons) because I love their soups.

I just wish they had more in Chandler/Gilbert so they can deliver to me when I'm drunk."}
{"text":"My favorite Madison sub shop.  Salads are awesome, they let you add all kinds of veggies to your sandwich for free, and the delivery time is usually only twenty minutes (depending on where you are).  I order here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Silvermine subs is one of my go to sub shops. There staff is usually friendly and you don't have to wait very long for your food to be ready so that's a plus. 

I highly recommend the buffalo stampede if you are a fan of hot subs."}
{"text":"So last weekend, after Patties, I ended up going to SIlver Mine because there was no way in hell I was going to wait in line for 45 minutes for a Philly Cheesesteak. Especially since I am doing so well with my \"eating healthy\" kick. 

Luckily Silver Mine is open late (till 4am I believe), so I was able to grab a bite that was relatively healthy: The Tombstone: Turkey Breast, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Sprouts, and just a light dab of Mayo on Wheat Bread.

Everything was perfect. The bread. The lettuce. The sprouts. It was a fantastic sandwich.

I've been to this location several times. The staff is awesome. Don't judge them. They are good people, VERY friendly and they love to hang out. 

I come in to grab a bite every month or so, and they always remember me. I like that kind of customer service. I'm a friend for life."}
{"text":"They get one star for piss poor service on my latest online order!  I ordered a 16 oz bowl of chili and a medium sandwich for delivery to my home!  I get a call from Tyler about a minute after I place the order saying that their supplier is out of chili so they don't have any!  I say no big deal can you just give me a grilled chicken salad instead....He said oh the price is different on that and it's too hard to put in the system since you placed your order online.....REALLY????   Too Hard???   The price is ten cents higher for the salad....Any employee with half a brain would've just called it a wash, charged me the same and brought my salad with the sandwich....When this kid said it's too hard for him to fix, I just said well I guess go ahead and cancel the order then!   Instead of saying sorry, we can fix it or some other way of saving my business....He just said ok.....Sounded about half stoned when he called me as well.....What a joke, and makes not ever want to do business with these guys again, regardless of how much I like the food!!"}
{"text":"wow,how incredible!!! I always order from silver mine subs on MCCLINTOCK AND SOUTHERN...IN TEMPE,ARIZONA do not order from there! i ordered a sandwich lastnight and it came to me wrong, the employee ( JUSTIN ) who I spoke with last night gave me a credit and when I called in to make good on my credit i spoke with the New Manager who REFUSED to give me his NAME, told me to take my business elsewhere and that he wasn't going to make good on my credit of $9.49- ( UNDER NEW MGMNT- NEW MGR WAS VERY RUDE! ) I told him i am going to facebook this and yelp it too and let all of my friends and family know how he runs his store...I and my family and whoever else I can tell about this experience will not buy from them again! They lost my business for sure! Remember - WORD OF MOUTH IS THE BEST ADVERTISING THERE IS... ."}
{"text":"Great subs and open till 3am, better than any other sub fast sub shop, get the chill on cold days yummm and than potato  salad in the summer :-)"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is that this place is fast but I think that is because they don't put meat on their sandwiches. Maybe this was just a product of coming in there at 10PM?

If you're looking for meat, go to Firehouse Subs. If you're looking for a lettuce on a bun, come here!"}
{"text":"The delivery drivers seem to take their time. They always say it takes about 40 minutes, but it's always close to an hour or more. The food is good and I like the variety offered compared to many other places. I got the wheat bread once, but it seemed really dry and not very good, so I'd recommend the white bread. I don't order here often because the service could definitely be improved."}
{"text":"Ordered an online delivery order for multiple people. 

Cons: 
Despite having given the names of the individuals while ordering, ours subs were not labeled to distinguish between them. 
The side of potato salad that was delivered was not properly sealed by the manufacturer and was broken open, this product shouldn't have been served. 
Broccoli and cheese soup didn't have much flavor aside from the thick taste of the cheese. 

Pros:
The large size sub is truly large and was happy with the portions. 
Delivery was made a few minutes prior to the set delivery time I had requested."}
{"text":"Was so stoked to find a Silver Mine Subs up here, having LOVED us some Silver mine in Tucson. I hate to say it, but we were so underwhelmed. The subs just didn't have the same love. The bread is still good, but the' je ne se quoi' was lacking. I used to love getting Silver mine on University or Oracle Rd. The S.O. and friend went inside to pick up the food and apparently the store staff didn't have the best attitude. I stayed in the car and noticed the outside was way dark, kind of creepy. Maybe you guys have some light bulbs burned out, please check. Anyway, the food was solid, not great. The bread was nice and fresh and the quality of everything else was ok. I added hot peppers and got like 4 slices on the whole sandwich, all of which were the stems. Gross, picked them off. I'm not in a rush to go back, I would even go as far to say that I might be able to wait til we visit Tucson."}
{"text":"Food poisoning, which wasn't on the menu was served.  After about four hours My wife developed the classic symptoms of the ailment.  Vomiting, diarrhea, fever and cramps.  Resist the urge to use their coupons.  Try subway instead.  What she ordered was the medium Tombstone sandwich
 I think they need to check their handling or be visited by the board of health!
After and consulting with medical people, we were informed about sprouts, which she had and I  did not.  Maybe, just stay away from sprouts."}
{"text":"Love silvermines, love brad and his crew on kyrene sad to see that location closing! But no bad experience at any location."}
{"text":"There are so many sub shops in downtown Tempe it's hard to decide.  I'd say Silver Mine is marginally better then most and the prices are good.  I think the best thing they have going for them is that they deliver in a college town.  I work in the area, but have never taken advantage of the delivery service, so can't rate them on that.  I do know that when my husband and I were vendors in the Tempe Festival of the Arts Show and our booth was near Silver Mine, it was a God send.  At that time we had the sandwich that has all the Italian meats on it and I'll have to say that's the best they have.  When I go I tend to order something healthier like turkey, but none of those are as good."}
{"text":"I get silver mine all the time for lunch at their belt line store, and I was just downtown the other day and saw their new location.  I will be going there before and maybe even after ever home badger basketball and hockey game.  Screw waiting in line at ian's for a slice of pizza.  I'll take a cripple creek (chicken, bacon, ranch) over that any day!"}
{"text":"I eat silver mine all the time at their belt line location for lunch! i saw their new location downtown the other day and I will definitely be going there before and maybe even after every home badger basketball and hockey game.  Screw waiting in line at Ian's for a slice of Pizza.  I'd rather have a cripple creek (Chicken, bacon, ranch) sandwich any day!"}
{"text":"The manger was rude and hung up over the phone while I was telling him that my French dip had no sauce, not just that I ordered two large sandwiches and they sent over Two small sandwiches but still charged me for large. An employee answered the phone and apologized for his manger'a behavior as I can hear the manger yelling in the background. The employee helped me and was so nice. I don't understand how he is a worker and not a manger by the way he handled the situation and made up for his mangers misbehavior."}
{"text":"Serves up nasty, soggy sandwiches made with extremely questionable ingredients. Last time I ordered from here I spent most of my day fighting a stomachache. I finished half of my sandwich and went for the rest 2 days later, only to find that all of it was already turning into a gooey brown lump. I tried feeding it to the ducks instead but even they wouldn't touch that shit.

Basically the meat is obscenely greasy, the cheese is fatty and flavorless, the bread is always wet as if it were dipped in water or something (I really hope it's not fat, but it just might be), and the veggies are processed garbage. 

You're much, much better off ordering Jimmy John's or Milios if you're looking for a delivery sub. Way fresher and in the case of JJ's it arrives twice as fast."}
{"text":"Took them over an hour to deliver and when my sandwich arrived the bread was old and crusty. Will not be ordering these low grade, bland, cheap sandwiches again."}
{"text":"Great subs.  I find that cold sub places around campus tend to be very mediocre (looking at you, Jimmy John's), but Silver Mine does them well.  Putting them above the crowd, however, is certainly the avocado spread, which pairs well with many of their sandwiches.  

The prices are reasonable to a little high, but the free wifi is easy to access and very reliable, making this a regular stop for me if I don't want to go all the way down to Green."}
{"text":"Typical sub shop, except for lazy employee who made my sandwich, who was sitting her big tushie on the counter as I walked inside. Then, you had the dancing dude at the register taking cash and the low quality \"college drinking\" food that was served. There was a dog that wandered away from its owner at Tempe Town Lake and it was hanging out at my bench and I unloaded most of my Chicken (Frontier) sandwich on the mutt, who seemed to enjoy the pre-cooked chicken strips. Just know that your sandwich will take 15 seconds to make and if you are expecting them to put your chicken on a grill before they serve it up think again. It's all pre-cooked and sitting in bins for who the hell how knows long. This is not a businessman lunch place, it's a late night \"we don't care what we are shoving into our face place\""}
{"text":"Our first visit was a five:
We came across this place by accident but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. My husband had the silver city sub which is an Italian style sub, which he said was one of the best he has ever had. I had there home stake which was really good as well.

Our last visit would be !/2 a star:
Service was very slow and the sandwiches were not very good at all we should have gone to Jimmy Johns down the street. We wont be going back!"}
{"text":"Lets just say that I go here for lunch at least twice a week. As does the rest of my office. It is that good. Not just because its a hop skip and a jump from my building, but every sub I have ever had here, minus the Philly cheese steak which we will discuss later, has been tasty and fresh and simply delightful.

I've tried The Dodge City - Pepperoni, Salami, Provolone, etc, .. The Caribou- Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, LTM etc... & The Comstock - Roast Beef, Provolone etc.. I love everything about all of these EXCEPT for the fact that they do not *actually* use avocado slices, its more like, avocado paste. Not guacamole. Paste. Still tasty if you can get past the texture, but I would prefer the real deal. 

Now like I said, Ive also had the Philly Cheese Steak. Ive got to be honest. It tasted like vomit and old cow. There wasn't enough cheese and the peppers on it were overwhelming. Silvermine either needs to a.) alter this recipe immediately or b.) completely nix it from the menu. It was g.r.o.s.s.

Let me give you a little money saving hint while I'm at it.. It is cheaper to order a sammich that has all the toppings you want then removing something rather than adding an extra topping to a sammich. if that makes sense.. At almost $2ea for some of them, ie: pasty avocado, you will certainly save a little.. especially if you eat here at the rate that me and my fellow Terraleverians do."}
{"text":"I would estimate that I order from Silver Mine no less than three times a week. Old habits die hard, so consider me Bruce Willis. No, not the ridiculously creepy version of Willis played by Joseph Gordon Levitt in Looper, but the John McClane version. 

I've had good results going with the Cripple Creek, basically a chicken-bacon-ranch. 
I've also tried the Silver Ploom (good), and the Tombstone if I'm feeling like a lighter meal. 

All in all, I can't say I've ever regretted spending money at \"The Mine,\" and I'll continue to do so. 

The people working there are always friendly, and the delivery speed is always pleasantly surprising. 

4/5 from me."}
{"text":"Other than showing up with food, Silver Mine Subs had a worse than Subway subs performance.  They did show up with food, which is ...good?  But really, the hot sub was cold and obviously had never been warmed based on the rock hard never been melted provolone.  I guess they will work in a pinch, but really, really sub-par."}
{"text":"Rock solid subs!  Simple menu and way better then those big sub shops.  Will go out of my way for Silver Mine Subs!!!!!!!  Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie sub and cheddar broccoli soup via EatStreet delivery. Sub was as ordered as expected and loaded with fresh veggies. The bread was nothing special but tasted fresh. I enjoyed the many customizations through online ordering, I didn't see a sub that I particularly loved on the menu but I was able to pretty much create my own. The soup was pretty good as well but was extremely cheesy. I would probably describe it as melted cheddar with flecks of broccoli in it. It was almost too rich so I added my own bag of freezer broccoli and was much happier with it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good. 

Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes! 

P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)"}
{"text":"There is something so comforting about silvermines. It reminds me of living at home with my parents and ordering in on a Friday night and watching movies. 

There food isn't earth shattering by any means. But the sandwiches are consistent and customizable. 

They are open and making sandwiches until 3am which is amazing. Perfect for lazy nights in, or a sobering late night snack. 

I love that they deliver fountain drinks and pretty much anything else. 

I will continue to order here any time I'm job Scottsdale visiting my folks."}
{"text":"the veggie subs are great, the bread is really fresh. delivery only took about 25 minutes.
They definitely need some more side options though. but  great prices, would order from again."}
{"text":"Fast service. They load up the subs pretty well here."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a salad for lunch. The best thing about this salad was the bag of chips that came with it!  The iceburg lettuce had more rust on it than an unconditioned 1963 Chevy, the chicken is some kind of extruded processed meat concoction and all that was accompanied by three cherry tomatoes. This was unconditionally the absolute worst salad I have ever had! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Dependable quality and fairly timely. Wish they could reach Nesbitt rd faster or open one in Verona. We love the variety they have."}
{"text":"I live literally a block and a half from this location, so when I moved to my new place I was excited a sandwich stop was right down the street. Unfortunately, the sandwiches just aren't worth the price. A large sandwich is about 2/3 the size of one I could get from subway for less. All of the sandwiches are good, but I don't feel like I'm getting all the bang for my buck. It is nice that they have late hours for some after-the-bars munchies, but I have only eaten here a handful of times. If their sandwiches and prices matched better I would probably eat here once a week."}
{"text":"I ordered from here because I was craving a good sandwich and needed some place that delivered. I used the online website and was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to maneuver and figure out. They called to make sure they got the address right BEFORE leaving to deliver it which was refreshing. I ordered an 8' Dodge City and a side salad. The side salad came with fresh, yummy bread. The sandwich was the perfect size and tasted delicious. The portions were perfect for how hungry I was. This place is also great late night if you have spent the evening having several alcoholic beverages. They are open and deliver until 3 a.m. Check it out."}
{"text":"if this review was based solely on those little brownies they sell, it would be 5 stars. I'm only reviewing this place bc of those pre-packaged brownies. do yourself a favor and order 27 of them, they are so tasty. if you HAVE to eat here(drunk, late night), get the sandwich that has the salami, I forget the name, and add banana peppers. but don't forget your 27 brownies, there's no point in really eating here without the brownie."}
{"text":"Can I Give a negative number? We went here once before, like two years ago and the tables were so infrequently cleaned, they were stained. Well, we figured we'd order delivery. First, $25 for 1 small and 1 medium sandwich and sides was a bit high, but worse, no drinks are included, and they apparently ran out of regular chips so instead of calling and asking if we wanted something else, they just substituted those baked lays that taste like cardboard and put in note, at the bottom, under everything. I ate two and tossed the rest. This isn't the worst, the worst is the gastrointestinal issue we both had the next day. Read between the lines. NEVER.EATING.HERE.AGAIN. Please go out of business so a Jimmy Johns can open in your place."}
{"text":"Only went there once and will never return. The guys behind the counter were completely stoned- blood shot eyes and slow speaking. 
We watched them make our sandwiches and everything seemed fine, they wore gloves and all. The subs actually tasted very good. 
The issues arose as we sat there eating our lunch. The guys were working on a catering order and I've never seen such disgusting handling of food. The main guy never put gloves on, and repeatedly wiped his mouth and nose while making the sandwiches. They were in such a hurry that they dropped food on the floor several times, picked them up and put them on the subs. The main guy also kept using his hands to pick up handfuls of meat and condiments, then throw back the unused portions. We finally had to throw our food away and walk out when the other guy ran both his hands through his long greasy hair, then continue making a sandwich.  
Shame on them!"}
{"text":"Silver Mine Subs is a really good sandwich shop preparing interesting arranged subs.

One of my initial tests when evaluating a sub shop is the feel and weight of the sandwich after picking it up from the counter.  If it feels light and mushy, well that's not such a great thing.  

Weight gives you a good idea of how much meat is in the sandwich.  While mushy tends to indicate too much veggies.  I know that may sound arbitrary, but if you think about it, it's a decent first impression.  My King Bullion was solid and felt like a pound or so.  Good first start.

Other sandwiches on the menu that looked interesting (photo): 
-Georgetown (turkey breast, bacon, provolone, avocado); 
-California Gulch (tuna salad and provolone);
-Comstock (double roast beef and provolone); 
-Silver City (salami, ham and provolone).  
The Cold Subs run $4.49 for the small, $5.99 for the medium and $7.49 for the large.

My medium 8\" King Bullion had roast beef, turkey breast and provolone (see photo), along with some veggies.  The bread held up well and didn't fall apart while eating.  It also came cut.  Nice!

The inside of Silver Mine Subs reminded me of that industrial motif favored by Chipotle.  Instead Silver Mine uses concrete board, in place of dry wall.  It also has a \"surfer dude\" feel.  Don't ask me why, I guess I heard too many \"wow, man\" on my visit.

I would give them 3 3/4 stars, rounded up to four after my first visit.  I would rate them ahead of Subways and Bimpies, but behind Jersey Mike's, Capriotti's and Jimmy John's and worthy of a visit.  

I would agree with Gabi M's take: \" I'd go the extra 1/2 mile for Silver Mine over Subway any day.\"  Hell, I go an extra 5 miles for a Silver Mine!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The subs are good, the bread is fresh, and they deliver late.  This is a great combination in my book!  The prices are good and they have a lot of different kinds of subs.  They do lack in side dishes."}
{"text":"I've never been so horribly disappointed with a delivery food service before. I ordered two claim jumper wraps for delivery which are advertised to contain turkey, bacon, ham, and cheese. It was accompanied by a very apatizing picture of leafy romaine and a large looking wrap. 
Fast forward an hour and a half because that's how long it took for my order to get here. 
There are so many things wrong, where to start?
Firstly why does delivery take over an hour when the place is a 7 minute drive.
Secondly my order was completely wrong. I'm not sure what happened, if I got someone else's order due to the driver or if the store decided to randomly change it. Regardless, I did manage to get one of the two claim jumper wraps I ordered.
Thirdly the wrap looks absolutely nothing like the picture. I'm not talking McDonald's hamburgers vs reality, I'm talking these wraps are as big as a taco Bell 2 dollar burrito. I took a bite and was greeted by tortilla, tortilla, some cheese and more tortilla. Confused, I opened the tortilla to find 1 slice of turkey and 2 slices of ham. 
Seriously? I paid 7 dollars for three slices of meat. 
I've worked in a deli for years so I know the value of meat slices, one slice of ham costs a customer about 10 cents, and we would give out 2-3 samples to every customer because they cost the business almost nothing. I got a sample portion in my wrap. I'm just so upset.
To make matters worse the Romain looks sad and wilted. 
This is my first time ordering from here, I don't think I'll every try again.

Update: the other thing I got that I didn't order was some buffalo chicken sub. They actually put a fair amount of chicken on there, good 3-4 oz on the whole sub. Whoever ordered this asked for extra cucumbers and olives and blue cheese. There were no cucumbers on the sub and the olives were falling out as I unwrapped it, and there was cheese but it wasn't blue, it was just provolone. Overall still disappointing that they can't follow instructions like adding cucumbers and cheese."}
{"text":"What's to say? It's basically like something you could make it home if you wanted to take the time which I can't say for Subway or Milio's unique flavors. That is what makes it good(and also bad) to some. That said -- it's cheap delivery subs and it's a nice option to mix up the normal delivery options."}
{"text":"Great subs for when you have just finished a long night of drinkin.  5 stars for them putting up with some of my more intoxicated friends."}
{"text":"Although the customer service was super pleasant, the sub sandwiches were not.  They are great for a drunk person that just has the munchies but not the place if you are looking for quality."}
{"text":"Found a long black hair in my sandwich today. I had to pull it out of my mouth. It was pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place so I was pretty disappointed when the sandwich turned out to be even less appetizing than a Subway meal. And that's a stretch, cause I don't really like Subway, either. Silver Mine's subs were overpriced for a totally bland sandwich. Bummer. I imagine they'd be good if you're drunk and hungry for total crap at 2am, but I wasn't. It wasn't even filling."}
{"text":"Love this place. Open late so I often stumble in here after the bars or on my way home from a late movie at Harkins Camelview. Yummy subs -- the hot subs are all delicious and you really can't go wrong. Friendly employees and fairly loud music playing, usually throwback hip-hop/rap. 

My fav is the Tombstone (meatball) with just parm. cheese. 

Open until 3AM every day."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  A five dollar sub... And one thin piece of turkey and one thin slice of bacon.  I thought the turkey was a piece of cheese.  The avacado is a spread.  They don't tell you that either.  Best thing was the bread.  Worst sub I've ever had.  Rude teenyboppers running the store.  Won't buy again.  If I could give it no stars."}
{"text":"The Coeur D'Alene is on point! Obsessed with it.  And don't forget your pickle! Prices are decent.  Delivery is fast.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service I received, I had ordered extra tomatoes and got none on my sub. This is the third time I've gotten delivery from this specific location, and the second time I've had an improperly prepared order. It's not that hard to make a sandwich properly!"}
{"text":"i love the sandwiches here.i wish they could toast them but everybody does that.so its a good change of pace.the brocoloi cheese soups is gooooooood.and always at least foe me get extra cheese.delivery is usually consistent escpcially if you havent pissed them off.like some of my friends.2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I placed an online order for a 8\" sub and a large iced tea, and received an email confirmation and also the automated confirmation on their website. The message said the order would be delivered in 45 minutes, and it being a Saturday I expected my order to take the full delivery estimated wait time. After an hour went by, I decided to call the store and find out if my order was on it's way yet. I have been ordering from Silver Mine Subs for 5 years, and never had a very long wait time, especially on such a small order and always living near a location. When I called the store, the first person I spoke with said he did not receive my order to their system and that he didn't know what to do, that they just didn't get it, that they had been having issues with their online ordering, and I could just re-order. I stated that that was not acceptable and they needed to fix this issue and asked to speak with a manager. He put a \"manager\" on the phone, who actually admitted that he was not a manager and only a shift leader. I expressed my frustration with lack of solution from speaking with the first employee, and the shift leader was no better. There was no empathy, or concern for keeping my business and he stated that there was NOTHING he could do and that I needed to call corporate. My order also totaled $12.60, however charged my account for $16.13, and when I mentioned that information, he as well said that it wasn't his concern and there was nothing he could do.  I even suggested that he deliver my food personally and I will show him my receipt for purchase to prove I wasn't trying to scam him, and he said he would not do that, and that if I wanted food, I need to re-pay and he would bring me my order. I kept asking him if he was being serious, or if this was a joke because never in my life have I ever had such terrible service, and he insisted there was nothing they were going to do, and that I needed to call corporate. I asked him for the corporate number, and he stated he didn't have it, and that I had to go online to get it. I politely told him to \"eff off\", and called the websites corporate number, where I got someones voice mail. I left a message with my name, number and story of what had happened and never received a call back. This morning I called the store to see if maybe I could finally talk to a manager. I was able to talk with Justin, who repeatedly apologized once I told him the full story, and he sounded so embarrassed. He offered me to come in for my order this evening, and that he would also provide a gift card for future purchases as long as it meant keeping me as a customer. Funny how he also mentioned there was only three people working that time of day, and he knew exactly who I was talking about and that they have had previous problems with that employee. So all in all, I cannot say that I will ever eat from here again after I am done using the gift card, and the only reason I will use the gift card is because I do not want to waste it. Although the manager Justin finally fixed the problem, it still does not sit well with me that this could ever happen again at this location nearest me, and that a well known business in Arizona would hire people who act this way towards customers, and they knowingly kept him having had previous problems. I understand there are people who make mistakes at their jobs, but is the juice really worth the squeeze? Not for this girl."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place ever....really.  We found this place visiting my son at U of I.  I crave it when we are away."}
{"text":"Man I wish there was a business in SD like this. I do a lot of late night eating in my town, and there's only a few choices for somewhat healthy eats after hours so I was thrilled to see that this sandwich shop was not only open till 3am, but they also deliver. 

It came quick, it was pretty darn tasty, and I didn't wake up with my digestive track saying \"F*** You A**hole!\" A foot long turkey with avocado to my hotel room for under $10 at 2am?!?! Can I get a hell ya?"}
{"text":"Don't order from here! In my sub, I found a nickel attached to a piece of duct tape. 

How does this type of thing even happen?!?!!!"}
{"text":"I love their wheat bread,  and I love that I can get sprouts and avocado on a sub.   

Four different iced teas (unsugared, sugared, sugared green, and raspberry i think) is nice too.   

The staff at this location always seems like they're having fun,  which may not necessarily make the sandwich taste better but makes the overall experience of buying lunch a bit more pleasant.     

Of the locally available chain sub shops (Subway, Blimpie, Port of Subs, Goodcents, Cousins, and I'm probably forgetting some..),  Silver Mine is easily my favorite."}
{"text":"The owner contacted me about my review and offered me a free sub card to make up for the veggie sub that I wasn't satisfied with. This was so incredibly professional of him. I will definitely give them another shot for that reason alone. It takes a very caring and professional owner to do something like that."}
{"text":"Placed my order online from their website. Waited an hour and a half like a dumbass. Called, no we never received that, our fax machine is acting up. Fuck you."}
{"text":"Need drunk food on mill? Look no further than silvermine. They stay open late to feed that post boozing hunger and they have good subs to boot. I got a sub with roast beef turkey and cheese and it was just what I needed. My buddy got some of the broccoli cheese soup which was surprisingly good and I am not even a fan of broccoli cheese soup normally. 

Only real knock on this place is that it tends to be a bit pricy when compared to other similar sandwich places"}
{"text":"So glad they reopened this location! I absolutely love their sandwiches and was devastated when the original AZ franchise owner closed up shop. I'm so glad that corporate has taken over and come back to the Phoenix market. I plan on stopping in as often as possible."}
{"text":"I recently just discovered this place about 2 weeks ago. Ive already ordered from them about 4 times and every time its been great! I have done the order online pick up in store and also delivery every time i have had no problems

the food is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Requested no mayo, got
Mayo on my sandwich. Roast beef sandwich is gross, very ground and dry."}
{"text":"Love these guys! Great food, great service, and open till 3 am! LOVE THIS!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times only because so close to home.  I can't say I'm a huge fan of sandwiches.

On the positive side:

Rolls are good.
Veggies are fresh.
Meat is decent quality.
Delivery.

On the negative side:

Avocado translates to a spread.  I forget that every time and order it the next thinking I'm getting the real deal.  Last time, I actually thought they missed it.  I didn't see it, I didn't taste it.  But at the very last bite, I spotted a small green dot of it on the end of the bread.

Potato salad is commercially packaged.  Same brand some of the grocery stores carry.  I'm sure I'll forget that as well and order it again, be disappointed, etc.  I would prefer they not offer it at all if they can't make it in-house.

Prices are on the high side for sandwiches that are just basic meats and cheeses.  We purchased a small (5\"), a medium (8\"), and the side of potato salad for $13."}
{"text":"Subs are good.  Standard.  Not great, not bad.  

The two-star rating drops it down from the 3-star I would normally give them because, to put it eloquently.  They are slow s fuck.

Ordered a sub for delivery last week and, although I live only a half a mile away, it took 1 hour and 20 minutes to receive my sandwich.

Today, I thought, \"Hell with delivery.  I don't have time to sit around all day waiting for their slow asses.  I'll just go in.\"  The place was empty except for two people waiting for their sandwiches to be made.  I walked right in and ordered a sandwich.  

Ten minutes later I still wait for my sandwich so I decide to Yelp-fuck their terrible service as a way to vent.  

Wrote that entire review and still no sub : (

Hungry.  Sooooo hungry."}
{"text":"The Silver Mine Subs' Tucson location got me through college at U of A, especially thanks to their late hours and delivery! Since those days, I've had this Silver Mine Subs in Tempe a couple times and to sum it up: they provide a decent sandwich that hits the spot but doesn't make me want to necessarily write home about it. It's just a decent sub that's especially good if you're in a huge hurry, you're kind of broke or you're hungry after the bars and need some food to eat on the cab ride home. I like that this location has a killer honey mustard they serve with their sandwiches. The bread is sofy and chewy and they offer a wide variety of toppings."}
{"text":"I had to update this review because I would hate any fellow Yelper to come here after my last experience. 
My second visit here and I was truly disappointed. I expected a fresh, yummy sandwich and what I got was crusty and dry. It was horrible. 
I ordered the French dip and the brad must have been sitting out for a while. The beef was dry and hard on the edges. Not the slightest bit appetizing. And the au ju sauce tasted like it was made from powder. 
The Italian beef was just as bad. Subway is better than this. 
I haven't decided if I'll give this place a go again. It really seems hit or miss."}
{"text":"Just placed my first order online from Silver Mine Subs and am very pleased!  With delivery time being just 18 minutes from when I ordered my sub arrived fresh and delicious!  Easy online ordering, quick delivery and a tasty sub...I'll be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly. Amazing subs. Open late too so if you have the munchies."}
{"text":"I have never ordered from this place and I never will again. I ordered a turkey sub L-T-O cheese and mayo. And I ordered the steak sub which comes with cheese green peppers and onions. I asked if they could add lettuce and tomato. When I got there the service was good. Friendly cashier and my subs were ready to go. When I got home my sub was dry, they messed up my order, and it did not agree with my stomach. I understand why this place gets 3 stars on average and people order late night cause it tastes horrible!!!  My wife said the turkey sub was okay, definitely not better than Subway or JimmyJohns. I have gone to the bathroom twice since I've eaten the sub. The meat tasted like nothing and it clearly wasn't very good quality. When I called back to tell them what happened they said they will notate my account to make sure the subs are done correctly next time. Don't ever order the steak sub!!!  I have never written a review but it needs to be done this time. Don't order the steak sub from Silvermine unless you have time to go to the bathroom a lot. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY! They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy' Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJ's doesn't have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great. My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!*"}
{"text":"They make a fantastic sandwich excellent choices great toppings the cheese is proper and the plus is they're open until 3:00 a.m. enjoy late night snacking or lunch time pretty much any time."}
{"text":"This place does not understand customer service. I ordered my sub for delivery at 1 pm and it said that it would be arriving by 145. 210 rolls around and I called about the status of my order. *keep in mind I work around 10 min away* and he said that it was on the road and will take 15-25 min. Um WHAT. So I told him that that is ridiculous and that it was promised that it would be here almost 30 min ago. And he said Okay do I want to cancel my order. Smh. So I cancelled my order and told them that they wont be charging me and they agreed. 

I work in an office of more than 20 people and we will not be ordering for them ever again."}
{"text":"Taste was meh. Couldn't finish it it was that bad....Jimmy Johns and Subway win over this place. I regret giving a tip. Couldn't even finish the food. Biggest waste of $12....Good cookies though."}
{"text":"There are a ton of sub shops around Madison, all around the $10 range with delivery and tip. When late night comes around and you're looking for a bite to eat, don't look here. 

I'm not a super adventurous eater when it comes to my subs- whole wheat, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, no mayo and just a smear of dijon. Not once have they gotten my order correct. Other reviewers have mentioned issues with toppings missing, so apparently this is a common occurrence. The last (and the deal sealer for me) was when it took 2 hours for what was literally just a mustard and lettuce sandwich. Thankfully I went through Grubhub and was able to get a refund fairly hassle free. 

With so much competition in the area, these guys really need to step up their game. If it's the allure of a warm sub you're looking for, try Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab lunch. Was greeted by a cool guy and my sandwich was made fast!! Silver mines subs are the best. Mmm... I was so hungry!!"}
{"text":"Great sub! I got the Dodge City. I was in and out in less than 10 min. I've been here a few times and it's always pretty good. I think the menu has everything you're looking for and it looks like they deliver too. If I would have looked online before going I guess I would have saw that."}
{"text":"I don't live near Silver Mine anymore (tear) but do love their sandwiches! I actually crave these guys and love their punch card system. I can't tell you how many times I've earned a free sub! If you're a dessert person, their brownies and cookies hit the spot! Plus, who can complain about delivery AND staying open late, and I mean 3AM late! They also offer soup, chips, potato salad and a pickle for side options. Simple and delicious, can't complain!"}
{"text":"Ordered here for lunch a few times. Nice big lunches but nothing super fancy. a little over-done on the sauce."}
{"text":"I was a fan of their subs but what happened to me yesterday made me swear not to come again to this place.  When I arrived I saw the woman who took the orders smoking outside and we she entered to get my order she didn't go first to wash her hands, but I thought she is only going to take my order and let me pay for it, but then she called me to take my sandwich and I saw her wrapping my sandwich with no gloves on her hands. I took my order and went back to my home and when I opened my sandwich I smelled the smoke on the wrap!!! I felt so disappointed. This is really disgusting, I couldn't eat my meal. I am not paying money to eat dirty food so I wont be back to this place ever.!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great place for a sandwich, especially late.  Good alternative to Filiberto's or Amado's when you work overnight.  Quality sandwich.  A bit pricey, but no argument here."}
{"text":"Trash. Said I was \"out of range\" then just said sorry didn't refer me to anyone else didn't apologize. Great example of customer service."}
{"text":"Despite the construction on Indian School, this place was doing some major business during the lunch hour on Monday...

I was starving and I wanted to something somewhat healthy but quick... I remembered reading Donald's review and thought about calling for delivery, but I decided I'd go check the place out myself instead.

And I'm so glad that I did!

The place is super clean, the employees are really friendly, the prices are right, and the food hit the spot too - it was exactly what I needed to fuel the rest of my busy day.

I went with a medium \"Caribou\" on a tortilla wrap.  What's a \"Caribou,\" you ask? It's Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Sprouts, Mayo.  I know what you're thinking... \"Isn't she on a wedding diet?\"  Well - yes, I am.  I ordered it with only single cheese and no mayo.  The wrap is low carb and was supposedly whole wheat but I'd question the whole wheat part.  It was really good though!  I also ordered a side salad and a pickle... both delicious!  (If you like a sweet tangy honey mustard dressing like I do - they've got that too!)

I'm so glad to know about Silver Mine - I'd go the extra 1/2 mile for Silver Mine over Subway any day... or I'll just have them deliver.  Either way, I'm sold!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice, and got two sandwiches each time ( one for that day and one for the next day). First time was ok, but the Italian type sub had way to much oil on it. It was just an oily mess and tasted awful. The chicken one was great though in a tortilla. The delivery time was lengthy but not terribly bad. About 45 min. 

The second time I order  (today) was ridiculous! I forgot my lunch today and was super busy so I ordered my super late lunch at 3:30 pm. I didn't get my food till 5 pm!! An hour and a half delivery time! It was supposed to be 45-60 min delivery time, which I find fair in Madison, but 1 1/2 hrs come on!!! So mad! I could have drive there and back in that time a couple times!....at least the wrap I got was good and hopefully the one for tomorrow is fine to, but they need more drivers or something. That wait time was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment.  Little competition for the nearby Milio's Subs.
The menu is a little confusing with silly mining names.   I think they are overpriced for the quality and my sandwiches were just ok and nothing that tasty.   Went there twice and went back to Milio's."}
{"text":"We just happened to get a flyer for Silver Mine Subs.  They delivered 10am to 3am, so we thought we'd try it, wow not disappointed.  We ordered on line and got free delivery.   The Mother load was just as it described, it is the Motherload of all subs with the oregano and vinegar and oil it was pure heaven!! Thank goodness we had ordered a large, leftovers!!!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, decent customer service, decent subs.  Hey I gotta like it."}
{"text":"Had delivery through grubhub by far worst delivery good I have had got their version of the French dip the core de lane well the need was cold should be hot no au jus and the meat was burnt very poor experience especially delivery time was an hour"}
{"text":"Its hard to mess up a sandwich so getting 3 stars means their subs are pretty on point.  The sandwiches they have are nothing special but they have a good selection and their delivery is usually pretty timely.

The best part about Silver Mine is their broccoli cheddar soup though.  It definately hits the spot on a cold day."}
{"text":"Silver mine is solid. They deliver late and have great sandwiches. 

My go to is the caribou on wheat and then the mother loads, cripple creek. All of them are on point. 

Check it out"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious sandwiches :)) thanks Silver Mine subs ! 

Ps if u sign up online u get a free sub - I recommend it"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery through door dash and the food arrived at least 30 minutes earlier than quoted. Unfortunately my sub was incorrect. I had ordered it with mayo and on white bread and it came dry on wheat. My husbands was pretty good, despite the extra mayonnaise so they got an extra star for that and forcing me to be a healthier person."}
{"text":"The best way I can describe the taste of these subs is to say that they are like a more expensive Subway.  Twenty bucks for two subs, 2 chips and one drink.  Subway would have been cheaper and tasted the same.  There was an ample amount of meat and the bread was soft, but my sub was very salty and I think they forgot the vinegar, oil, and seasonings that were supposed to come on it."}
{"text":"Very bad costumer service. Placed an order at 10p and was delivered 40 minutes later incorrectly. I called to try to get a correct sub re delivered. The manager told me it would be over an hour delivery time and they refused to credit my card back even for the one incorrect sub. I would never spend another dime here."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place! I always get delivery, & they are fast and accurate with our orders. They usually get to us within 10 mins of ordering. They are my go to lunch!  The tombstone is my favorite, no sprouts;)"}
{"text":"This Silver Mine was just awful. My sandwich was bread, bread, and more bread and a ton of mayo. Go to the Silver Mine off of Mill Ave in Tempe. Much better, and they won't jip you of your meat."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I frequent this place.  They are a no frills sub shop...but good.  I have tried several of their subs and they are pretty tasty.  There are so many sub shops in the area, but I will walk the distance for their subs.  Great selection on the sub menu, it is always fresh."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but they do have a tendency to slightly mess up orders. Not a huge deal for me because I'm not very picky, but if I were, I'm sure this could be a deal-breaker. My latest delivery had jalepeno chips instead of the bbq I ordered."}
{"text":"The better known location is on Mill Avenue.  Which is precisely why I prefer this one down on McClintock.  There are three important things to know about Silvermine Subs.  They serve Submarine style sandwiches.  They are open until 3am, and they deliver.

My personal favorites are the Dodge City, and the Georgetown with no avacado.  Don't get me wrong. I love avocado.  Lustily and with a passion that I simply can't express for most foods.  Avocado is the metaphorical cherry on my proverbial sunday.  The avocado at Silvermine's is most assuredly NOT avocado.  It is some sort of pureed concoction that strongly resembles what I would imagine would come out of the ass of an incontinent goblin.

The service is pretty good, but watch them when they make your sandwich.  They are all stoned all the time.  This is a good thing in a sandwich maker, but sometimes you have to make sure they remember that you wanted extra cheese, or no tomatoes or whatever blows your skirt up."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is A-OK.  I like the western theme and usually can find a 20% off coupon."}
{"text":"2016 update: the cookies have gotten much better. 

I used to eat here because I lived super close and they could get a delivery to me within 10 minutes. When given any other option I'd rather get subs elsewhere. I find Silver Mine to be much more bland than any other place and the cookies are always hard. On the other hand, the bread is quite good and so is the chili. Unfortunately the chili is a little over priced for what it is. If you're close and drunk, definitely go for it. Otherwise go drive some where else.

The staff is always very friendly though. I haven't had a bad experience with a single person in the 4 or so years I got food from here."}
{"text":"For a sub place, there are certainly better (Cousin's) and there are certainly worse (Subway). That said, I like to think Silver Mine falls in the middle. It's pretty much on par with places like Jimmy John's, Milio's, and Potbelly's (which is different from the other two, but about the same quality-wise).

The place itself is relatively clean and there's a standard amount of choices. The meats taste pretty fresh and it's all pretty cheap subs. Taste is pretty run of the mill.

My real complaint lies in the bread--it's OK, but nothing spectacular. And there's no choices aside from white or wheat. To be fair, I'm pretty sure Jimmy John's, etc. are the same way, but at least their bread is just amazing. Silver Mine's is meh.

Overall, not a bad place. They've got some pretty decent deals and they're pretty standard, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had this delivered to his place in Tempe one night when we returned from Casey Moore's and he ordered me some sort of turkey samich with avacado and bacon. I must say, that was one of the most delicious subs ever... not just because of the circumstances but because it truly was amazing! The delivery guy was there quick and friendly. I will be visiting soon!"}
{"text":"food is just okay, nothing special, but service has problems - I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich without green peppers (allergy) and with mushrooms instead; when the order was delivered, they got that part right, but there was no cheese on the cheesesteak.   I called and they said I'd get $2 off next order - yeah.   Last week I ordered the same and got the same - no cheese on the cheesesteak.   I called the store and the manager asked the preparer and they swore they put cheese on it - all but accusing me of lying.  They sent a driver out with a new sandwich and I gave them the old sandwich.  The new sandwich  had 1 cheap slice of tasteless something that might have been cheese, but I couldn't say for sure what it was; it was not ooey gooey tasty melty cheese that I expect in a cheesesteak.  I'm done with them.  Too bad, they are close to home and quick service, but totally unacceptable quality."}
{"text":"I needed a quick dinner bit and decided to give this place a try in the middle of the night. I must say, the homestake sandwich was excellent. I also order a small bowl of chili and that did the fix! Really taste like a home cooked bowl of chili. The food was fresh and hot on delivery. Glad I found this place. Will definitely order again when I'm in town. Thanks Silver Mine!"}
{"text":"Not a good place for breakfast. Sign and ads say they open at 7 which hasn't happened this week. Breakfast burrito is average at best. 
Doubt if I will try them again."}
{"text":"I was dying of starvation was almost 3 in the morning I'm at Scottsdale Plaza resort and there's no food within a mile of anywhere over eats wasn't responding to the front desk tells me this place delivers I call the young gentleman that answered the phone said he thought it was too late as it was close to 3 AM he put me on hold he came back and said I got you I'll send a delivery save the day as I possibly would've died I was so hungry my friends were too drunk my receipt says his name is Shawn please give him an add a boy he save my day would leave the driver was Ziggy super friendly anybody reading this if your hungry and it's late at night or not Not even late at night I highly recommend this place from the staff great food great sandwich Jj"}
{"text":"My experience here was not so great! The sandwiches lacked meat, cheese, ingredients and worst of all flavor!!! They were out of the kids meal items so instead of fruit she had a cookie and larger drink!! The sandwich I had was bad! And the sandwich Jared R ordered was loaded but he was not told that the 6 extra toppings were going to cost him over $2 extra!!! His medium sandwich was over $8!! Thats insane! Makes me see how much subway or even quiznos can be such a great deal!!"}
{"text":"DELISH! The bread was soo soft and fresh and they put just the right about of meat on their sandwiches and condiments as well. The establishment was clean and and the staff was super friendly from the greeting we got entering to our exit. 

Kinda wish we had one up north by my place, but would definitely go out of my way for this over a subway any day."}
{"text":"Oh....my 2am delivery staple.

Their \"til 3am delivery\" feature is one of the beauties of Silver Mine. Their sandwiches are always fresh and these people are fast. The Dodge City w/ a side of chili is my go to. So, so good."}
{"text":"I remember when I was a freshman in college how excited my roommate was to have a Silvermine Subs right down the street from our dorm.  She was from Tuscon and told me how she would always make her bf drive her up to Tempe at least once a month just to get a sub.  Then my bf lived in the apartments right behind Silvermine Subs, so they became our go to food when we were lazy.  The subs were good and they had some good sandwiches to choose from, but overall it was way too pricey for such a small sandwich!"}
{"text":"I like it a LOT. The rolls are soft and fresh, the meat is sliced thin (the way I like it), and toppings are fresh and flavorful. I had a slightly-more-than decently-sized portion in a medium Dodge City sub for $6. Knowledgable staff with good suggestions when I couldn't decide what to order. High school employees (and friendly ones, at that!) reminded me of days gone by..."}
{"text":"Has gone down in the past year. Skimpy sandwiches, longer deliveries. Coming on 90 minutes now, they're less than two miles away, and it is in the early hours of a Monday morning. I feel stupid for pre paying the tip."}
{"text":"I have to say I love coming back to Silver Mine Sub over and over. They slice their meat that bread is fantastic. My favorite sandwich is the king bullion my kids love it too. All I have to say if you want a wonderful tasting sub silver mine is the way to go. A true fan DJ Chris Birkett"}
{"text":"Best sub delivery in Madison! They are always fast and fresh. The subs are delicious! I have never been disappointed in Silver Mine. I've dined in once and had a lovely experience, as well. The prices are very reasonable. A large box lunch makes for 2 meals and only costs a little more than ten bucks. 

The workers and delivery drivers are always friendly. I order from the downtown location several times per week."}
{"text":"I love Silver Mine!!!  I first ate this at work, since it is right down the street from my job and they deliver.  When I found out that they were open until 3 am, I began eating it more frequently, since I am a manager at Walgreens and if I close, we don't leave until after 11pm.  I love the Georgetown and the Dodge City sub!!!  The people that work there are really friendly and they always try to throw in extra stuff such as cookies or brownies, and even an extra sub one time.  If you are a sandwich person, you will definitely love Silver Mine Subs!!!"}
{"text":"If your out on Mill partying, you should definitely eat here once your done. You don't need another slice of pizza. You will thank yourself the next day."}
{"text":"Needed sandwiches fast and got them. This was a handy location heading into Old Town from the 101. I had pastrami, it was good, friend had turkey, it was also good, Nothing hugely special but a solid sandwich for like $7 each.."}
{"text":"Much improved an continuing too improve sub shop .. Good Subs! .. Love the hours & the staff cares to custom make orders. They offer great suggestions too."}
{"text":"I like Silver Mine Subs. 

I have tried different ones: Cripple Creek (friend introduced me to them years ago), Frontier (tried yesterday based on employee rec durign Customer Appreciation Day), Mother Lode (didn't get Frontier when emp rec during Customer Appreciation Day but got this instead), Dodge City (bought several times) but thE GEORGETOWN is my 5 star go to. 

I don't like places that assumingly have pre-customized sandiwches or slop mayo on anything like this place and other shops in town but after my friend introduced me to this one  - I gave the Georgetown a try and it won me over. Minus the lettuce and tomato add onions, peppers & hot buffalo sauce bam!

They offer tortilla wrap in lieu of bread. 
Regular Coke product fountain drinks
Bottled water, energy drinks and sodas. 
This one has the sweetest lady manager on sundays. She adapted the Challenge for the kid (we have yet to do it) but I've never had a delivery issue and I've had delivery 2-3 times. No stamps on delivery but now they're doing BELLY as a customer loyalty and I like that. 

I decided to write because I couldn't believe how low the stars are and I ususally agree with Yelper \"S.M\" and I try not to write about places that I frequent often for fear of anyone tampering with my food but hey~ I like these guys and glad they have the Beltline 2nd location. 

Carry Ms. Vicki kettle chips along with Frito Lay products. Kid says the brownies are awesome or the cookie. I don't know I'm allergic but they offer soup, soda, pickles, slaw, subs, delivery, platters and utensils."}
{"text":"Okay so based on the food... Nope. The service was awesome.. I walked in around 1 or so and the workers jumped up. Im pretty simple and asked what their best sandwich was. It was a Georgetown they said. Alright good enough for me. Then I got the sandwich and started looking at it... well it was so skimpy on the meat I was confused as hell.. It looked like 1-2 oz of meat.. Literally one piece of turkey and 2 pieces of bacon.. I understand it was a small.. But still for 6 bucks i think it should fill me up. It was more bread than meat.. I worked at a few sandwich places before and all load em up better than here.. I recommend Firehouse Subs. May pay a $1 more or so, but when you get 4x the meat its so much more worth it."}
{"text":"Forgettable. Humm...... Forgettable right away. Ok, that is better."}
{"text":"Silver mine is reliable which gives it extra brownie points. They deliver until 3am! Especially for those of us who work late, get home late, don't want to cook so we get delivery.  My two favorite subs are the Frontier and the Silver Plume. I think it's a unique idea to theme a sandwich place after a \"silver mine\". The guys that work there are really laid back and try to be as helpful and accommodating as possible but they are getting 4 out of 5 stars because their menu is literally just sandwiches and drinks."}
{"text":"Just tried to place an order for delivery, but didn't want to use their online ordering because I had a few questions, and I called 3 times and the phone just kept ringing and ringing and ringing. It's a Saturday at lunch time. You think they would answer? I guess not...."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience. We quit ordering from them years ago because of delivery times, when you're at work you only have so much time for lunch, but today decided to try it again with online ordering. The only thing they got on time was their money. We ordered in advance, requested a specific delivery time and gave them 2 cell #'s and an email address to contact us if there was a problem with the order. 25 minutes after they were supposed to get here they told me they got the order 40 minutes after I submitted it and got confirmation from them and it would be 15 to 25 more minutes before they could send someone out. Never once did they call or email to let me know, I asked 3 times during 1 phone call for the order to be cancelled since my lunch was over and the person manning the phone just kept talking over me. After the third time I was assured it would be cancelled despite the fact that none of this was their fault, they don't control the internet (but emailed me a confirmation when I ordered) and I would not be charged. I had to run out to get some things later in the day and found they still delivered the food about 20 minutes after I cancelled, under the incorrect name (even though I had to enter my name to register and put it on the sandwiches) and didn't call or email (despite having that info also) and just left it at the front desk with the receptionist where it later got thrown away. The kicker though - the receipt showed the correct order time, the condescending person on the phone lied on top of everything else. If they had called and said they were going to be late, it could have been planned for, maybe they were busy, but to just not show up and then blame the internet instead of being honest is too much. I did email them to see what they would say about my experience but got no reply."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a great sub called the \"Silver City\" which I find is a great alternative to the \"Motherload.\" They're a little on the pricey end for subs, but I find it's worth it.

The only complaints that I have is that they sometimes dont answer their phone when it's busy, therefore I feel awkward placing an order on an answering machine. That, and when they're busy, it feels like it takes forever for the food to come and they never give me ETAs."}
{"text":"Silvermine is great.  I order from here all the time.  They deliver until 3 am and they have a pretty extensive sandwhich menu.  The only downer is that a prereq to work here is that you must smoke massive amounts of weed sooo order your sandwhich very clearly and make sure they repeat it. : )"}
{"text":"We have had excellent food and service from other locations,  however, this location has continually messed up our online order and delivered at least 30 minutes later than the 45 minute delivery time. I miss the other locations.  This restaurant has lost our business."}
{"text":"Omg i moved out to Scottsdale from Illinois 4 years ago. Subway is a chain restaurant & old and outdated, who hasn't had Subway. I never tried Jimmy Johns until today . I had no choice i moved from Scottsdale to Gilbert and they don't have a Silver Mine...so very disappointed and i don't get the hype JJ is mean to be. There was NO turkey on my sub, i asked for avocado and got a dab...I'm sorry but if you've ever had Silvermines Caribou sub you don't know what you're missing...is mouth watering and i would give anything to have one of them right now after the horrible experience and distaste JJ left in my mouth. Silvermine is the best. You can't compare then to any where else. Please make your way to the east valley and central Phoenix.  :-) love, a happy customer :-)"}
{"text":"Ok so I hate to do this on assumption only, it MAY just be coincidence (or maybe not), but my date and I went for late-night Silver Mine Subs and were both felt ill the next day (him more so than me): gurgling guts, stomach cramping, and on and on. 

Location:
-right off Mill, very convenient for those already drinking on Mill
-difficult to find parking nearby if you are NOT already on Mill (which we weren't)-- parked 6 blocks away and walked in
-open til 3AM, again convenient for the drinking crowd

Staff:
-very friendly staff, especially since it was after two in the morning
-never felt rushed, they allowed us to take our time ordering, add things after they already \"built\" the sandwich.
-started cleaning up the filthy seating area, were very polite and waited for guests to leave before cleaning that area

Cleanliness:
-floor was really filthy, I'm sure it's because of the late night drinking crowd
-there was an entire sandwich under one table-- it had literally stuck to the floor
-bathroom was \"OK\"

Food:
-I got the Caribou 5\" sandwich, unsure of what date ordered
-everything tasted really good going down, but both of us felt sick to our stomachs the next day
-drink fountain is cool with lots of different soda options, plus add-ins like flavors

I really appreciated the customer service aspect of Silver Mine Subs and their subs are delicious and flavorful. But the drunk frat boy making out with his sandwich (literally couldn't keep his head off the table while eating), the dirty floors, and the illness that followed a late-night grub sesh here is enough to keep me away for awhile. Corleone's is just down the street...."}
{"text":"Just really meh. We ordered delivery, and the subs and cookies were both just okay.

I would not recommend the wheat French bread. It was just dry and not tasty. I wish one of us had ordered white to see if it was any better. The subs came as ordered, but my Italian had way too much mayo, and the vegetarian was mostly lettuce with very little avocado, cheese (supposedly double) or tomato, and again a lot of mayo. Their cheesesteak was ok, but I'd much prefer a warm cheesesteak to have cheese melted on top of the meat, not tucked between the bread and meat.

The cookies are packaged and say they're from a place in Utah. This was probably great when they were a small, local chain, but it just meant I got a dry cookie. I'd much prefer they ship frozen dough and bake in store than ship cookies already baked. Again, both varieties were just blah.

Good chip selection, they offer discounts on yelp and Grubhub, I like the wide menu selection, it's nice they deliver all over town through various services, but I don't think we'll try again. I can get a tastier sub for the same price in half the time."}
{"text":"Got a sub delivery. It's hard to find places around downtown Tempe that deliver when the tab is under $10. This alone made me happy.

After the food promptly came, the sub significantly exceeded my expectations :-)."}
{"text":"Lots of options. Good subs. I ordered the Georgetown with all the veggies and it was good. I feel like the veggies could be more flavorful but similar to jimmy johns and subway. I like the vibe and the music they play. Rock music like blink 182 and ever clear and a old mining town theme throughout. Very nice and helpful staff."}
{"text":"A very decent sandwich. Not the best I've had, maybe a shade above Subway (though Subway has definately upped their game lately). I agree with another yelper that I thought it was very well portioned. 

While my sandy was tasty, I will not go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"The bread here is 1 star and when you have a sub place the bread is very important to a sandwich.  The meats are so so. I would much rather go to Jimmy johns for the same amount."}
{"text":"Fresh subs that have good portions of meat and veggie to bread.  The subs are untoasted, so they taste more cool and refreshing rather than crispy and hot.  There is a pretty good selection of toppings to choose from, such as mushrooms, bell peppers, tomato, etc.  The interior is really old school, with wood panel counter and older style decor.  I really feel like a mining prospector could come in here, order a sub, and feel right at home.  Service was fast and friendly, although the sub maker messed up the order a bit and added an ingredient I didn't want and forgot an ingredient I actually wanted.  Johnny Cash was playing in the background which also added to the old school feel, and I got a brief musical history lesson from the cashier/sub guy who told me he recorded the song in Folsom prison.  The sub itself was about $6 for a medium, and while it isn't the best sub I've had, it was decent, and a good choice if I am looking for a sandwich late at night."}
{"text":"It was 2 am and I was starving.  Excellent delivery time and the meatball marinara was excellent! Thanks! I'll be ordering from you guys again late at night I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Can't even order here... Either the phone rings for 50 seconds or someone picks up and hangs up right away before I can even speak. Super disappointed. Who runs this place? I used to love the silver mine in Tucson but between reading the other reviews and being unable to even place an order here not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"SMS, I enjoy your food, but is it so much to ask for some sort of \"hello/hi/hey/good evening/thanks/your welcome\" from your delivery guy?"}
{"text":"I wish i can give it a zero. I ordered through Yelp eat 24 and the order was completely different. Not only that the guy was continuously to argue that they are right even though i had an email confirmation along with the receipt. Later on he went on the side and was telling his co-worker that he was right and now i want something different. I just walked out. It wasn't worth fighting for $6. VERY BAD SERVICE."}
{"text":"Gross! Bland deli meat on bland sub bread with bland toppings. Was it food? Yes. So I guess it requires stars."}
{"text":"Excellent and cheap subs and open till 3am!! All the veggie add ons are free as are most of the spreads, etc. 

Wish they had a spicy option/hot sauce, etc. but you will not find higher quality, cheaper food late night than this."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Silver Mine Subs.  The delivery is so fast it will make your head spin.  Like, crazy fast.  Fast enough that you maybe are still hanging up the phone and suddenly there's a man at your door handing you a delicious sandwich.

Also, it's cheap. Not cheap like, \"I'm going to question the quality of this...\" but cheap like, \"Hey,$7.50 for a sandwich, chips, pickle, drink and a cookie? That sounds awesome!\"

Sure, Jimmy John's has that certain je ne sais quois, but their delivery range is not nearly so vast.  Neither is their menu."}
{"text":"Not a sub fan. All sandwich stores taste the same with me. 
Just had their delivery at my job and their steak sandwich is pretty good."}
{"text":"The subs are definitely better than Subway, Jimmy John's, or Jersey Mike's.  Better bread, better toppings, and much more meat (I'm actually pretty surprised that some reviewers have said the opposite about meat portions). They sometimes like to smother sandwiches with mayo, which is fine by me, but might be off-putting to some. The tables can get a bit dirty at times, especially around lunchtime, but I rarely sit down to eat inside. Delivery is also a little slower than others, but they deliver much farther than Jimmy John's will, so it's an obvious tradeoff. Overall, you know what you're getting when you buy a cheap sub, and Silver Mine Subs has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"The mixed to negative reviews kept me away from Silver Mine since this location re-opened, but after leaving a kickback at the apartments next door the allure of a large sandwich at 2am was too much to resist. This sandwich shop should be commended for having ridiculous hours. They stay open until 3am! Since my first time eating there, I usually come in for a large turkey and ham about every other week. I always do carry-out so I can't comment on delivery times, but customer service is strong. No errors on toppings and speedy service.

Even when placing my orders at midnight (amazing midnight snack option!) the bread is delicious. Fresh and squishy but strong enough to keep everything together. Meat is on par with Jimmy Johns, and head over heals better than subway and quiznos. Portions are fair, not generous but not skimpy.

I'm really into their toppings. The yellow peppers are higher quality than what I'm used to and really amp up the taste of basic sandwiches. Green peppers and onions are always fresh, crisp, and generously applied. I love when a sandwich maker knows how to perfectly balance toppings and apply just the right amount of mayo oil and vinegar. They never skimp on the free toppings and when you load them up they make the sandwich more filling.

This sounds like a rave review, and it truly is, but why the 4 out of 5? Because of the extended hours and labor costs the sandwiches are easily 2$ over priced. These are 6-7 dollar sandwiches, not 9-10 dollar sandwiches. But hey, if you can afford to live or play in this area its probably no big deal."}
{"text":"I enjoy silver mine from time to time
When I used to live on campus at ASU main Silver Mine would be one of the only late night delivery places
Their subs are good, from the meat to the cheese, to the bread...
Their prices are pretty reasonable as well and their staff is always friendly
Tonight I had the kids sandwich combo because I wasn't very hungry and I enjoyed it... I think it's a good portion for kids... It also comes with a bag of goldfish and a fruit roll up stick :)

Also the deliver until 3AM"}
{"text":"The empty parking lot at dinner time should have been our first clue but we persevered. We had seen the menu online and had decided to split two sandwiches, Boomtown and whatever they call their French dip. The \"BLT\"sandwich making consisted of putting pre-made cold bacon on some bread with a glob of mayo,a sprinkle of lettuce and some unripened tomatoes. The French dip was dried up \"meat\",in the broadest definition of meat you can have, pulled out of a tub of liquid and slapped on a loaf of bread. That's it. No cheese, onions or mushrooms as a normal French dip would consist of. Now truthfully I was scared of what kind of damage this mystery meat would do to my stomach but I tried to keep an open mind. The \"BLT\" was mediocre at best. The bacon, cold and hard. All I could taste was bacon grease, which coated my mouth. I tried the French dip aka mystery meat wad on crusty bread. I can't really describe its taste but the texture and temperature of it was so off putting. Dried, cold.....meat. I had two bites and decided a bowl of oatmeal sounded better than a night worshiping the porcelain god."}
{"text":"After going to their location on Mill, I wanted to grab some food from this location too.  I came here yesterday after my car got fixed, and was happy with the consistancy of the food.  Same tasty subs!!

Surprisingly, it seems to be a college hang out. I can understand the location on Mill, but this one?  Anyways, food is reliable and tasty, affordable and easy to access.  Will return in the future."}
{"text":"Was out on a date yesterday, and we had worked up an appitite.  We were on the light rail, and decided to stop off on Mill to find food.  Walked down mill for a second, and found silvermine subs.  SCORE!

I had never been here before but I liked it.  Its not the fanciest place.  Simple location, good food, decent prices.  They seemed to have a good selection of hot and cold subs, with different side items and combo meals.  I got the King Bullion, and it was tasty!  I went with the small sub (5 inches) a large pop and some chips.  Food was up in no time flat.  Seems to be a college kid hang out, especially considering the location. 

Would return in a heartbeat.  Tasty, reasonably priced, and right off the light rail on Mill."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch at 10:30 on a Sunday morning and my trusty Yelp app indicated Silver Mine Subs was open for business, so I hopped into the Manlander and made the 3-minute trip to grab some sustenance.  

When I arrived, I was the only customer in the store (not surprising, as Silver Mine probably is not on the top of anyone's list for Sunday brunch).  The store is clean and well maintained.  While the staff not overly enthusiastic, they efficiently cranked out my order in less than two minutes.  

My Homestake sandwich (Angus Philly Cheese steak, provolone cheese, green peppers & red onion) was typical sub shop fare.  While the bread did not provide very much flavor, the bread to filling ratio was spot on.  The two-inch strips of raw red onion were extremely pungent and overwhelmed the other flavors.  I also was not a fan of the raw green pepper strips - meh.  A proper Philly Cheese steak needs sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms, not these raw veggies.  Another disappointment was the warmed but not melted slice of provolone cheese on the bottom of the sandwich - double meh.  The meat was well seasoned and generously portioned.  There a couple gristly bites, but overall, I enjoyed this component of the sandwich the most.  

While not a culinary extravaganza, I did enjoy Homestake sandwich eminently more than the horrific pastrami melt (shudder) I recently endured at Subway.  However, it paled in comparison to the sublime Philly Cheese steak sandwich I enjoyed at the nearby Parkway Family Restaurant.  So will I return to Silver Mine?  My gustatory Magic Eight Ball indicates \"Reply Hazy, try again.\"

Other observations and ramblings:
* Silver Mine was a Belly loyalty reward.  With my initial visit and subsequent liking their Facebook page, I became eligible for a free cookie during my next visit.
* Signing up for their e-mail club gets you a coupon for a free small sub.
* There currently is a 10% check-in offer on Yelp.
* You can order ahead online, which is convenient if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of my colleague at work. Thursday night I always need a quick dinner, and Silver Mine Subs did not disappoint. The guy working there was very nice and friendly and he listened to me as I changed my order a few times. The sandwich was good, though it might have been better toasted, and the bread is a little thick. However, any place that has a sandwich that includes both bacon and avocado is a winner for me. Also, I can get a dill pickle instead of chips. That's novel enough to give Silver Mine Subs an edge over the nearby Subway. It was a little expensive, next time I might not get the gigantic pop. Otherwise it was a very pleasant experience and I enjoyed it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I USED to like this place but I went this weekend and was so disappointed. My \"hot\" sub was cold and the meat was watery. My soup was also cold and I literally only walked a block home. The worst part was the service. The girl that took my order was so rude! She never smiled and she acted so inconvenienced by me when I was THE ONLY CUSTOMER there. They handed me my sub, soup, and bread and had me bag it myself. They've lost my business forever - from now on I will make the walk to Jimmy Johns or SAKS (always worth it!)"}
{"text":"Good subs. I wish they had a vegetarian meatball sub. That would be sweet. But I digress, I love the late night delivery. They are quick and always get the order right. Their cookies and pickles are great and the vegetables are fresh. Yum."}
{"text":"Pissed me and my wife off.  I understand that the delivery person has a tight schedule, but this is BAD.

Every once in a while, we order a sandwich from here.  Most recently, we ordered one for our daughter to get delivered to our house.  Apparently, our daughter didn't hear the doorbell ring when the guy arrived at the house (she is hearing impaired).  When my wife didn't immediately pick up the delivery guy's phone call, he moved on to his next delivery--I get this.  However, when my wife called him back a minute later, the guy refused to redeliver the sandwich, saying that he didn't want to waste his time.  Interesting.

Our doorbell is loud and plays for an extended amount of time--I'm surprised that she didn't hear it (she hears it every other time there's a delivery-why not from Silver Mine?)  We were also very surprised at the reaction from the delivery guy.  Again, I completely understand that he's got a lot of deliveries to take all over town, but his attitude really sucked eggs.  You don't refuse service from a paying customer, period.  The guy at the store tried to make excuses for him, but we weren't really having it.  The sandwich did eventually get redelivered, but it took a phone call to the shop to do it.  Not acceptable.

It's not the cheapest place to order a sandwich from--we like it because the sandwiches are high quality.  It's not worth it we get treated like this, though.  

We want food, not 'tude.  Got it?"}
{"text":"With the closure of one of my favorite nearby sub joints - Port of Subs on Scottsdale - I find myself pleasantly surprised to find another great sub joint pop up nearby. This one perhaps even better than my old favorite.

See, I don't like to eat at sub joints that get their meats shipped in boxes pre-sliced who knows when. Port of Subs was one of the few that cut the meat when you ordered. I'll miss that, but Silver Mine is close. They slice the meat fresh all day as part of the shifts. That means it's still very fresh. The quality of their meats and bread is great as well. Their bread is especially good. 

The restaurant is clean - immaculate even. The employees are all really nice dudes. So friendly, I doubt they're even from here. They must be from the Midwest. 

This place would probably deserve four stars like any other good sub joint should, but what sets this place apart is that they deliver until 3am. That's right - not only does this place deliver sandwiches, they're open until 3 mother-frenchin a-to the-m. 

Their brownies are 430 calories and they worth - they worth hard. They carry a great selection of chips and bev, and since they are relatively new on the scene - they seem to be constantly tweaking the business here and there. Their menus get revised every time I order from them. They give away scratch cards that usually give you a free delivery or a free small side item or drink or something. I have yet to win a car or my own franchise, but they popped up all over town at some point recently. 

If I did win my own sub shop, I'd change the tag line to \"You can't beat our meat\" because that's what the people would want.

Seriously, these guys are cool and the food is good."}
{"text":"The food is sub-par in comparison to other sub shops here in Madison.  But today just put me over the edge.  I ordered a lunch box special and iced tea.  W/tax, tip and delivery charge, it came to $14.  The driver arrived with ONLY my sandwich.  I'm like wha???  She apologized and said she would be right back with the chips and iced tea.  A half hour later I called the store and the guy on the phone tells me she hasn't even gotten back to the store, they are really busy and would I accept a store credit.  I accepted it but now I wish I hadn't.  I now wish I put my boots and coat on and walked to the BP and got a mocha frappe, a bag of chips and made some type of sandwich or soup here at home.  Would have cost less, for sure.

Don't bother with Silver Mines.  Cousins is much better (even though they don't deliver) and Pita Pit on State St is fab!  I cannot brag enough about Pita Pit!  Fresh food, great service, quick delivery...too many places to choose from to accept less-than-stellar service and food."}
{"text":"Initially I was going to give this place 4 stars, but their outstanding service has earned them the perfect score.  I ordered through campusfood.com 15 minutes before they closed and some sort of electronic delay resulted in my order arriving late, after they put all the food away.  The manager called me at 3:00 AM to tell me he canceled my order because they had already put the food away and were ready to close.  He then gave me a credit for the same amount that I could use anytime.  I ended up getting a free sandwich.  

As far as the actual food goes, they have a good variety between cold and hot sandwichs.  I haven't tried any of the cold sandwiches, but they their hot chicken sandwiches are awesome.  The buffalo chicken sandwich has a mildly spicy buffalo sauce with a creamy ranch and melted provolone cheese on your choice of bread.  Definitely my favorite.  If you're in the mood for subs and don't want the conventional subway or boring jimmy johns, I highly recommend silver mine subs."}
{"text":"I was hungry after class and decided to check the Hooked local deals for anything good. I saw that Silver Mine had buy 1 get 1 on any sub and ran over there!

I got one comstock (roast beef) and then a Dodge City (Pepperoni & Salami).

I've had the comstock before and it's decent. The Dodge City also wasn't bad either.

Portion size was good, I was full after 1 sandwich and saved the other one for another day. 

Tasted pretty fresh and put together really well.

Friendly guys behind the counter.

I saved over $8 with the Hooked deal and the subs were good.

5/5 this time!"}
{"text":"The food really does not taste good.

And theyve messed up my order several times.. but they're open really late. And deliver. 

Food won't make you vomit. But kind makes you want to not pay for it kind of maybe."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater and make a ton of modifications, all of which were correct when I received my sandwich. The zoomer driver was very pleasant. Delivery time was a little slow and my sandwich was lukewarm when I got it, but that will happen when you use a third party delivery service. Considering I usually don't like subs, I'm impressed(:"}
{"text":"Location is back open but you might as well assume it's not.  Nothing special about these sandwiches at all."}
{"text":"I wish i could give zero stars. They said i was taking advantage of free delievery when they give you a coupon everytime you order, drivers never ask for coupon but sure do want their tip to drive 1/4 mile down the road. Train your drivers right, to ask for a coupon if theirs a issue. GM got on the phone and started to laugh at what i was saying. Nobody at corporate office answers or returns calls. Booooooooooooo"}
{"text":"Siver Mine is up there on my favorite subs list in the valley. I tried Jimmy John's and I regretted not going to Silver Mine. I have tried almost every hot sub they have and my favorites include: Cripple creek (if I'm in the mood for ranch), Frontier (if I want BBQ), Steam engine (meatball mood) or the Buffalo Stampede (buffulo sauce). I have a hard time choosing between these 4 every time and I have to go through every scenario to decide. It's awesome that they deliver so late! I would say my experiences are 50/50, half delivery and half at the Mill location, both awesome!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience with Silver Mine Subs tonight. While at work, our employees were hungry and they wanted to go with someone who delivers. Silver Mine Subs delivers until 3am!!! Perfect!!  We placed our order on-line and it was seamless! We made a few changes to the items we ordered and it was delivered to spec! Plus they were QUICK!!  They will definitely get our business again!  The Cripple Creek was awesome (but I wished it was a little more hotter for a hot sub) and the Wheat bread for the Buffalo Stampede was delicious :-) I ordered a cup of Cream of Broccoli soup as well and it arrived nice and hot.  I would have given them 5 Stars, but because the Cripple Creek was a little on the warm side instead of hot, I gave them a 4."}
{"text":"Great food kinda pricey but I did get 11inches so I guess it's definitely worth it..... Lol"}
{"text":"I came here for some quick and fast subs. That's not what I got. I had a midterm to study for and instead, they completely forgot my order. They would have completely forgot if I didn't go up and ask for it. My time was absolutely wasted."}
{"text":"Most unprofessional place I've ever ordered from. There was a hair put in the cut of an 11\" sandwich so when I told them about this they cancel my order. 

I call them and ask for a reason and he said that he \"didn't like my comment about hair in the sandwich \"!!!
 
I was dumbfounded and he said that I was rude to the delivery people when the most words exchanged was thanks have a good night as I'm holding back two boxers barking and waking up my baby niece. 

I asked for the employees name who I was talking to about the problem and he said I should \"suck it\" and hung up on me. 

I work in a 5* restaurant and know for a fact this is never how a paying customer should be treated. 

I normally wouldnt waste my time writing a review but the service and disgust is so bad I thought I should to let everyone know that the people work here are obviously pieces of shit. 

Excuse my frénch"}
{"text":"18 hours of delivery service and a sandwich titled \"The Mother Load\" were all it took to get me to try this place.  The sandwich was ginormous, overflowing with meat, almost to the point where my arm started tingling.  The meatball sub is a sold choice also but I wouldn't recommend for delivery since it can take awhile.  I love this place and will continue to order from there as long as they deliver."}
{"text":"The people are very friendly and nice.

The food.  2 stars.  Meh.  

My sandwich roll did not feel cooked all the way through.  Doughy.  Tasted doughy as well. The meat, cheese, sandwhich itself was good.  My only complaint with the toppings was the onions were in chunks and not slices.  Based off the menu, they had a good variety of sandwhich offerings and toppings.  

The 11\" Roast Beef was almost $9 dollars with not extras on it.  Not worth the cost.  

Scrunching my nose... I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were hungry in Scottsdale, pulled out the entertainment book and there she was - Silver Mine Subs - Eureka!

I know, I know - another sub shop right?  Nope, this one is a bit different IMHO.  First off, we like the different sizes.  For us a 6\" is too much for my daughter but the kids is too small, 5\" is just right.  A 6\" leaves me hungry and a footlong is too much so the 8\" is just right for me.  The options were good, so we chose the \"Caribou\" - Tky Brst, Dbl Provolone, Avocado, Lett, Tom, Sprouts, Mayo.  The bread was fresh and chewy, the veggies were fresh, the price was right (especially with our BOGO from the book).  

The staff were all very friendly and professional, the service was fast and the place was very clean.  We took ours to go but next time we're hanging out just to look at the scenery ;)."}
{"text":"I contested the charge with my bank and so far... was able to get this removed. I never got a call back from the corporate office. And when I called the actual location again they told me that I would need to bring in my personal bank statement to prove they charged me again. Very shoddy customer service. It really is a shame because I like the subs and the service they provide. But unfortunately, I will never be visiting a Silvermine subs again."}
{"text":"Pretty good variety of sandwiches. Their sandwiches are pretty big too and they don't skimp on the meat. The grilled chicken they put on their sub is really juicy and has a lot of flavor. It's a step up from Jimmy John's and Subway for sure. Definitely recommend this if you're in the area and don't want the \"same ol' sub place\"."}
{"text":"Never again. A piece of what looked like slimy buddig (you know, that cheapie \"meat product\" you can buy for about $1.50 in the store--thin sticky monosodium glutamate stuff) turkey (yes, one measly slice) and some slimy green goo that's supposed to be guac? A couple of shreds of lettuce?Say, WHAT? Ok, so they deliver to the heavily imbibed until 3 AM, that's about the only thing going for this place. The sub I barely ate makes Subway look like a gourmet sandwich. Matter of fact, I could barely choke down a few bites. Where were the ingredients? On second thought, glad there were barely any, as there is no quality of any kind here. Truly, if you're looking for some crap to stick down your trap to absorb some alcohol, go for it. Me? I'd rather stumble into a Denny's to sober up. This was just so, so bad. I wish Jersey Mikes would open more locations. I couldn't make this bad of a sandwich if I tried. People will eat anything. Sigh."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a staple and always will be.  Nothing to write home about, but they are consistently quick and tasty.  They charge an uptick for additional goodies like guacamole/avacados, but any sandwich shop will do that to ya."}
{"text":"We live near enough to this sub place that we just drive or walk over to pick up the sub at the right time, so I have nothing to say about delivery times. We also tend to order in the dead of night so I can't speak to rush hour performance. 


They've never gotten the changes to order wrong when I've ordered. less this more that, all is fine. 


SO tends to get the motherload(everything on it sub) and he hasn't had any complaints. I've had both warm and cold subs, both were fine. 


If anything I'd suggest that they do more to separate warm subs from cold, even the 5 second drive to get back home leaves my lettuce wilted, so I can only imagine what happens on a delivery run."}
{"text":"SO for some reason the \"hot sandwhiches\" are no longer served hot. Instead they are served room temp. My coworkers and I have ordered silver mine for the last 3 years. When I complained about cold sandwhiches about 6-9 months ago I was told because of all the cold ingretients on them. Now we tried them again today and what ya know 3 more cold sandwhiches and one of them didn't even have cold stuff on it besides cheese. The managers need some serious customer service skills training and should be fired. Thanks Gorhm st SM in Madison, YOUR food and service is horrible and you should be ashamed of yourselfs"}
{"text":"The fact that Silver Mine delivers until three in the morning is what keeps me ordering. It's nice to have a non-pizza option after hours. Most of the time they are quick and reliable. The subs themselves are pretty standard and not something I would go out of my way to eat. Casella's (just north on Granite Reef and McDonald) is a locally run deli that has AMAZING sandwiches."}
{"text":"Bars stay open until 2am, this place delivers until 3am... Dealio!

I really enjoy their broccoli cheese soup, 99-cent side-salad, and the \"Georgetown\" sub.

Consistently good food, delivered really late - what a lifesaver. Give em' a try if they deliver in your area. They have surprisingly low prices too."}
{"text":"My god. This was horrendous. 

I ordered a medium French dip, I got home - popped it open. It was literally a 1/2 cooked wheat bun with I dunno, 2 slices!? Of roast beef. Dark brown and with a purple oily sheen on the meat. 

The au jus was awful, salty and kinda burnt tasting. Just no care or effort went into making it. 

If I wanted a terrible piece of bread and old roast beef I'd just go dig in last nights trash at Jimmy Johns. 

And the order-taker couldn't have cared less. He said wazzah while texting on his phone, didn't even look up and then didn't ask if I wanted anything else on the sandwich. No mayo no cheese etc. 

To call it a silver mine isn't even close, copper would be a stretch and certainly not gold."}
{"text":"I called in around 10pm for a pick-up order and nobody answered the phone which was odd because they're opened until 3am...so I decided to just drive there to find out that the two employees were sitting out front having a smoke. No thanks yo."}
{"text":"I agree that being in the puke-filled street isn't a plus, but it IS still right across from the psych building, which I enjoyed.  Some of their hot sandwiches are very craveable (the roast beef au jus one, and anything with barbeque sauce always appeals to me), and it's a nice change of pace from Subway, and sooo much better than Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Avocado veggie sub is fantastic, really quick delivery"}
{"text":"the sub was good the guy behind the counter not so good. a bit rude honestly.clean place. good music playing"}
{"text":"They re-opened!!!  The menu is a bit larger but the food is just as good as it was before the change in ownership.  Their meatball sub is the best in town.  Fresh every time."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and always willing to help out with your order. I have been here quite a few times and each sub is worth trying. Today I got the Mother Lode and it was perfect, tons of meat and veggies. Worth trying over the subway craze."}
{"text":"The Beautiful Carin and I went to Arizona Regional Mixer networking event last night (nice event and nice presentation by Gabi K, at the event!).
We were going to go to the Giants-Cubs game after, but by the time we got home, the wind was blowing hard enough that small craft warnings had been posted on Tempe Town Lake and the wind chill was down in the teen's.
What to do about dinner?
TaDa! Silver Mine Subs delivers!!!!
Within 20 minutes, they brought a quart of hot chicken noodle soup and a Chicken/Bacon and a Roast beef sub, right to my door, all hot and toasted.
Seriously, these guys will make you want to throw rocks at the Subway and Quizno's stores (both also close by, but...no delivery...haha).
The bread and the ingredients are fresh, and sandwiches and soup were well prepared and everything tasted great (does it really taste better when they just bring it to my door, or is it just me?).
Give Silver Mine a try, esp. for delivery!"}
{"text":"This is a good alternative to Subway. They have a more original menu and less of a corporate feel. There's also a punch card for frequent visitors."}
{"text":"Where to begin? These guys are open till 3am and they deliver... Their sandwiches are really tasty! Oh ... and every time I go in to the shop they're playing awesome music ...last time it was Pantera."}
{"text":"I actually prefer Subway over Silver Mine but it has an awesome student meal deal with a jumbo drink and a cookie. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try it.  I've heard great things but i was stranded at a hotel that is just under 10 minutes away but they were insistent that it was more like 20 minutes away and refused to deliver.  I had ordered online and had PREPAID a pretty generous tip.  Seems like they could go an extra block or two to satisfy a paying customer."}
{"text":"Went with so co-wokers who really like this place. Everything was pretty good.  Nothing to get too excited about, but a good little sandwich when you want one."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible in every way, shape and form. I've purchased food here at least 15 times. The order has been wrong every time. Literally every time. Missing cookies, wrong drinks, wrong toppings. The average delivery time is probably 2 hours - 3 hours when ordered in the evening. During my most recent 'experience' the sandwich arrived after 2 hours (after they somehow forgot the order and just gave it, requiring me to call). The sandwich was incorrect and other ordered items were missing. 1 hour and 30 minutes later (for a grand total of 4 hours including the phone calls) it arrived. I was almost shocked that it wasn't free after 3 phones calls and 4 hours. Please, do yourself a favor and never purchase food here. I've switched to Milo's subs for my subs now and they have been nothing but fantastic. I also find it interesting that their grub hub keeps disappearing and reappearing. Maybe so they can delete their horrible Grub Hub reviews?"}
{"text":"I  recently had my fist time (very possibly the last ) with this location and I wanted to express how horrible my order was in hopes that this will contribute to helping this location be better. I ordered online and I was able to write how I wanted my sandwich which wasn't a super difficult way and when I received it I couldn't believe how bland it was and disappointing.  The delivery service was fast and convenient which I appreciated but it was my meal that was not as great. My sandwich was mostly lettuce which overpowered everything else in it, I had 1 little skinny piece of bacon, my meat was 2 very thin slices of each kind I ordered to where  I couldn't even taste it, and I had one little glop of avocado on the bottom portion of the sandwich. Moving on to the soup which was mostly cheese sauce because there was maybe 5 little itty bitty pieces of broccoli in there. I had to make more broccoli (fresh from my house) to add in there which made it amazing after the fact. We ordered around 8:15pm so we received our order right before 9pm so I am not sure if it was the night crew not wanting to make things satisfactory but at this point I would NOT recommend this to a friend to try and I myself would not want to return to eat there again."}
{"text":"This my second visit to this location but this time for sure I know I won't be back. I like that they have late night hours but that also comes with the possibility of aged food etc. 
On my last visit I stopped in and ordered the veggie sandwich which is just cheese, avocado and lettuce -you can get tomato and sprouts too. The sandwich was a sandwich nothing special but the service was iffy. This time we stopped in around midnight on a weekend night and as my beau went in to order I knew we made a huge mistake. I watched the worker not only wipe his nose with his hand but also take his hat off and scratch his hair near the food counter. (No sandwiches were being made at the time) Now this was not the worker that made our sandwiches -maybe he delivers orders or does the register? Who knows but I'm sure he needs to retake a food safety class. 
As we make our way home I'm a little worried about the choice we made for our late night meal. We get home I'm secretly scared to open the bag and being super hungry - I just do it. The first thing I notice is the brown sludge seeping out of the sandwich -the \"avocado\" spread. EWW. Being so hungry and the fact that I already put a bra on to go get our late night munchies - I just scraped the brown goopy parts off and choked down the dry crusty wheat bread and my dignity -praying that I wouldn't get food poisoning. 
Turns out...this time...I have a gut of a goat and I was fine but still have flashbacks of terrible terrible sandwich. At least the Mrs. Vickie's BBQ chips tasted awesome. 
I've learned my lesson and never again. They should have an \"At your own risk\" sign on the door. 
The End."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from this location twice and BOTH times they've gotten my order wrong. Not things like topings either, straight up forgot items or given us the wrong size sandwiches. I'm done ordering from these clowns. Take your $$$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"The buffalo stampede and the Georgetown! Delish! Friendly staff!!!! We love Silver Mine Subs!"}
{"text":"We really liked the two sandwiches we ordered.   The homesteak which is a western version of a Philly cheesesteak.    The other was a pastrami sandwich they call the Outlaw.   Good stuff all around and they have some coupon action online when you place the order.  Better sauces than a Subway and the meats were very high quality.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Talk about a WIMPY sandwich!! And for way too much money! Ordering online, a \"large\" sub is like $10 with the delivery fee and that's not including if you tip your delivery guy! The bread is small like jimmy johns and the meat is like non existent... And all the veggies are barely there... I was SO disappointed and mad that I spent so much money on a baby sandwich... I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"FAST DELIVERY.  DRIVERS ARE FRIENDLY.  

GREAT GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD (you can add practically anything to it at no charge)."}
{"text":"I like silver mine because you can got hot or cold subs.  The buffalo chicken is a good hot sub and comstock is a good cold one.  I think it is just this location, but the staff is always crabby and sometimes don't make the sandwiches very well. Still like it though, it's a convenient location for me and is good if Ian's is full at bar closing time.  They also have delivery and I've always had good experiences with their delivery."}
{"text":"The cheese steak sandwhich was alright. I don't know if it was worth the cost. I'm not sure if I would order again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Silver Mine Subs four times now. Every time I order I get something I like and many things I don't like. And it doesn't seem to be getting better. Because of this I think I'm done with Silver Mine. Here are my reasons:

The Good:
-The Veggies: I've never had bad veggies. They are always fresh and quite generous. I am excluding the avocado.
-You can order late either over the phone or online for delivery or take-out. 

The Bad:
-The Bread: it's overly soft and squishy. While it holds up under sauce it gets really squishy really fast and is quite tasteless.
-The avocado: well, it's more like avocado spread. And it's tasteless. 

The Ugly:
-The chicken: it's often full of fat and questionable tasting.

This place just isn't good enough to get my business anymore. If the food was more flavorful and the chicken wasn't so gross I would be willing to try the food again."}
{"text":"Meh.  Pretty forgettable subs.  Jimmy John's and Milio's are better options for delivery."}
{"text":"I always loved this place. We would order online for pickup - Tombstone or Georgetown and Pikes Peak. We stopped in tonight without going online first and found they were empty :(( So sad! This was our favorite sandwich shop. On the plus side you can go to their other location (like we did) at McClintock and Southern. Note that the lights for their sign are out but the Open sign is on!"}
{"text":"Silver MIne Subs is almost like any normal sub place that I have been to, but this is the first one that is open until 3 am and delivers!  That is a major bonus because I often look for something of decent quality after a night partying out in Old Town.  Most of the time you are limited to greasy burgers, pizzas, or tacos after 2 a.m., but Sliver MIne will provide quality protein and carbs when your body most needs it to recover.  My friends have eaten here after several major drinking outings, and they have never had a hangover."}
{"text":"This Silver Mine has 2 strikes against it that apply before even entering the building:  It's on the same strip of vomit streaked pavement as Kam's and C.O.'s, and one of its other neighbors on the same strip is a Subway.

So why do I go there every time I have to buy lunch on campus?  Well, there are no scary cross-eyed employees there talking on their cell phones instead of making sandwiches (as at subway.)  Instead there is a totally friendly crew of regular sub-makers, as well as a delicious and satisfying selection of subs.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Dude, silver mine subs is the best vegan sandwich option- in my opinion. 
I order delivery from them regularly while I'm at work.
I'm surprised at how fast and delicious they are!
It's such a bonus that I can add sprouts and a million other veggies for no charge.
I'm definitely a customer for life ;)"}
