{"text":"I got an individual \"The Works\" pizza and it was pretty good. I think they are frozen & go through a quick bake oven but I still liked it. It's with the Subway."}
{"text":"This pizza is one of the best I ever had. My husband said that it was the best he her had! We shared a pepperoni personal pizza because we just wanted a snack. I did not expect a random pizza place to taste so good! The only downside had to be the price because it was 10 dollars. I think a decent price would have been a 8$ max BUT I would buy it again!!!"}
{"text":"Fire ass Pizza didn't expect to be fire like this 100+ worth it better than Little ceasers cardboard Pizza"}
