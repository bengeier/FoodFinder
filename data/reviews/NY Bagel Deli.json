{"text":"I really like this new place in Medina. Great food, owners are friendly and it is a cozy place for breakfast and lunch. 
I do wish they would change their hours. They close at 3PM. In a bedroom community where most people commute, they would be more successful if they found a way to be open in the evening at leat until 7 or 8, because that would allow people to pick up dinner on the way home. 
I have had both breakfast and lunch and the shear amount of different sandwiches and omletes they offer is great. I love the fact that the carry Boarshead meats which are preservative free and that they offer many egg white options.
Every thing I have eaten there including the bagels have been delicious. 
my only dissapointment and it was not a total dissapointment, was the Rueban sandwich. The flavor was great. It had a 1/2 lb of corned beef which is made fresh at the restaurant. The problem I had with it was that they did not drain the sauerkraut, so the juice ran, not dripped, but ran out of the sandwich as I was trying to eat it. It made the excellent rye bread soggy and fall apart. Second problem was the corned beef was not well enough trimmed and had a couple bites of all fat and gristle. the corned beef could have been sliced a little thinner in order to make it easier to eat in a sandwhich. If you have ever been to Slymans in Cleveland you know that corned beef has no fat or gristle when it is served and is sliced very thin and that way makes the best sandwich you can imagine. I hope they fix this small problem. It wouldn't take much attention to make it a Great Corned Beef Rueban.
They need to find a way to to diffuse the cold air from coming in the front door everytime it is opened. All of the dining are is right by the door and you are frozen and so is your food everytime the door opens. 
I don't want to end on a bad note because this is a grat little place for breakfast or lunch. Very worth trying. The Italian Steak Sandwhich was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"First saw this restaurant on New Day Cleveland. Dropped kids at school and decided to take this journey.I arrived to find a clean inviting deli. Liked the decor. Reminded me of deli's in NY (go figure).someone put time and effort into the design and I am very much appreciative. Love the elevated employee platform. Many Choices on the menu. Have an eye on a few for my next visit. Ordered a Cross Island egg sandwich with eggs over medium and horseradish cheddar on a poppy bagel. Wow! Real corned beef. Eggs done perfect and toasted just right.Delicious.  Customer service was above satisfactory. A little pricey but no objection due to the high quality and specialty deli that this place is. If I wanted cheap and boring (and nausea)I would have went through the drive thru at the 2 McDonalds I passed to get here. Cant hardly wait till I return."}
{"text":"Today was the second time I visited the NY Bagel Deli in Medina. The first time the place was bustling with activity and there was a line to place you order. Good sign. I ordered the Little Italy sandwich and it was fantastic. Today I ordered the New Yorker. Wow is the only word. It was huge messy and delicious.  Dominick seems to take pride in being out front at the register as much as possible.(he gave the entire ladies lacrosse team in front of me good a good luck bag containing a small portion of his homemade potato chips) Good to see. I am now a fan. Here's to much continued success."}
{"text":"I went here twice because I was looking for a good bagel place in Medina that wasn't Panera. The first time I got an everything bagel sliced and toasted with cream cheese.  I'm not sure if the toaster is broken, but the bread wasn't toasted at all even though I saw them put it in the little machine thing.  The bagel itself was dense and a little under cooked.  There was barely any flavor at all being an everything bagel.  It might as well have just been a plain untoasted bagel with cream cheese.  I decided to give it another shot after seeing some reviews on here but it was even worse the second time.  It was once again not toasted at all and no flavor from the everything bagel. But this time there was honestly enough cream cheese for 4 bagels on it.  It was a hilariously inconvenient amount of cream cheese that was too messy to even scrape off so I just ate the top half and threw the rest away.  I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Bagels fabulous. Hours lousy. Get up really early, like 6 AM. want a Philly cheese steak sandwich? Get that before closing time at 3. Last Saturday, learned the hard way. Arrived at 6:15 PM. Only place in the little strip mall that was closed for food. been there three times. Successful once, with a superior chicken salad sandwich on a lovely bagel. And a dozen unsliced bagels with two extra freebies. never mind I asked for sliced. the menu is mind boggling. But so is the food. The place is brand new. Kinks take awhile. Staff is lovely. Menu huge. This will be a great success because it fills a need. And it's very, very  good. I truly am from Philly and make my own cheesesteak sandwiches. Hoping they do as well. It is all about the roll. Nobody gets it right here, except at Summit Mall, of all places. Who knew? but that's a trek. NYBD is in my neighborhood. lookit. Every possible cheesesteak begins first thing after you unlock your door. Onions were chopped last night. Fire up the grill. Piles  of onions all day cooked at low and slow in butter so they caramelize. Hugely important. Skip this step? Then don't bother at all.  Go with bagels. They have that absolutely right.  This place is running fast to get squared away. It's gonna be good. Next year they'll need more space. Promise."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sandwiches. Huge portions and the menu offers something for everyone. The bakery items are great too."}
{"text":"The Real Deal.  Egg sandwichs, hot pastrami and real bagels... NYBD takes me back to the days of grabbing a quick bite while on the run on Long Island.  Boar's Head meat is a key differentiator from the Subways of the world.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"NY Bagel Deli is easily my favorite breakfast spot in Medina. The menu feels very authentic and the food is exceptional. Every sandwich I've tried has been outstanding. As a note, their egg white sandwiches are fantastic. I've gone in a few times just to pick up bagels for the office as well. Some of the best bagels and homemade cream cheeses I've ever had. The customer service is pretty good. Things can run a little slow from time to time, but they are friendly and try to get to everyone quickly. NY Bagel Deli is absolutely worth the trip if you're looking for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"i have no been to this deli twice once for breakfast and once for lunch. the breakfast sandwich was not only great it was huge. for lunch i got the cheese steak and my wife got the soprano and both were so good. i will keep going back. i still havent tried the bagels cant wait to try everything."}
{"text":"Tremendous!  Go for the plain bagel, add lox, cream cheese, tomato, red onion, and capers.  It's perfection.

The atmosphere is the perfect compliment to the menu - its a casual, relaxed vibe.

As soon as I finish this mammoth bagel, I'll be heading back up to the deli case.  I haven't seen a selection like this outside of NYC or Philly.

The price?  Perhaps a tad high (my bagel described above and a fountain drink rang up at $13.48), but go anyway.  The lox jacked my cost up, simply because it's high quality and frankly, worth it.  Who else is doing anything this authentic outside of the \"three C's\"?

Go."}
{"text":"Breakfast or lunch the food always tastes great.   A little pricey but worth the extra cost!    Huge portions.   I go there at least twice a month.  Wide selection and top brand lunch meat and cheeses. The coffee is good, they offer to go lids so you can take one with you."}
{"text":"Holy Cow - Simply Outstanding!  Brand new, this past week so still working out the kinks in the service execution, but the quality of the bagels and food is fantastic. Highly recommended, and worth traveling to if not from the area. Many people not from NYC have no idea what a true bagel is. Dominic, the owner of NYBD and a true New Yorker, nailed it. And the chopped salads - fuggedaboudit. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place for breakfast and let me tell you its wonderful best breakfast ever that is if your on the run and in a hurry would not mine returning and trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Restaurant is cute and the food is always great!  Great place to stop any time of the day!"}
{"text":"Traveled 30 minutes to find myself a New York bagel, and I was in luck with this place. It's just like I remember my little bagel shops in Staten Island and Brooklyn, walking in to the aroma of bagels cooking and deli meat in the case. It was St. Patty's day so they had green bagels which was awesome for me! I got a bacon,ehh& cheese bagel and it was a little doughy for me, the bacon was sparse and the cheese wasn't fully melted. My bagel was definitely like 90% the way a NYC bagel is, except like I said for me it was a bit doughy. I also got a lot bagel and a cinnamon raisin bagel, my kids enjoyed them and the lox was delicious. Price wise it's a little extra but I guess it's because there isn't any other bagel spots in the area. 

Inside was nice and clean, tables well kept, big screen tv to watch while you eat. The staff was super nice and helpful, young girls and ready to lend a hand. This place has a lot of potential but they need to get their product 100% if they are gonna rep a NYC bagel."}
{"text":"Seriously, it's as good as we're going to get when it comes to bagels in Medina.  The owners are genuine new yorkers, and really good people, I just waited on them in my restaurant and you can tell character pretty quick that way.  The lunch stuff is great too, fantastic wraps.  I also absolutely love how much cream cheese they put on the bagels, I beg to differ if you feel otherwise.  What I really like is the feeling of professionalism being like a chain, with still the feel of a local deli."}
{"text":"The bagel was ok, I think I could have purchase a bag of bagels for the price of what they charge, because it wasn't all that.  Waited close to 10min, for a toasted bagel that had triple the amount of cream cheese.  I heard the food is good, but no different then any other place.  Medina, Ohio still lacking a good food restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here on a few occasions. The selection is great, but the service is really slow. I recently waited 15 minutes for a corned beef with Swiss. The sandwich cost my 12.49 and was made so cheaply I almost went back and returned it. I don't mind paying for a good product, but this was not good. Very disappointing and overpriced. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Out of everywhere to eat lunch in Medina, it's one of our favorites. I love all the breakfast sandwiches I've ever had there.  

If they didn't tend to run out of coffee often while we are there, I'd give them 5 stars.  It's not that there is no coffee available, just not the type I want."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times when it first opened up.  Food was great but the staff you could tell was having issues getting orders right, which made customers a little annoyed since there was a line going out the door. The owner was making amends by giving screwed up orders free food or giving them a business card with his name on it saying he'll take care of them the next time they come in.  Hopefully they get into a rhythm.  It's a great addition to Medina.  Now all we need is a Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! October 16, 2016 at 11:30 AM I take my daughter in for bagels. My 16 year old daughter orders a \"plain\" bagel with cream cheese and the lady (wearing a Browns jersey) said \"I don't know what you mean.\" My daughter was confused and felt belittled. I asked her what does she mean and she said we are out of plain bagels. I said then you should have said that l, because you obviously know what my daughter said l. She made my daughter feel stupid, when in fact she was plain rude!! 

Never again will I spend a penny here! What has ever happen to customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm a NYC man, Living and working in Ohio so I feel I'm a good judge of NYC Bagels.  The bagels here aren't bad and closer to NY Bagels than any other Ohio place I've been to.  I might have even given them a fourth star if not for the Eagles Super Bowl Championship Banner hanging from the ceiling. Call it Philadelphia Bagel Deli. If you're an Eagles fan, put your banner in your home not in a place that purports to have a NYC connection."}
{"text":"Sub part food with extremely high prices on everything, No wonder why its called New York bagel deli. I ordered the St.Pats burger and it had barely any flavor at all and came with a damn bag of chips and a pickle not even a drink for $12. Better off going to Fresh food deli down the road, way better food and way cheaper too plus you get way more food."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and even better bagels I will be back for more bagels they are imported from New York and I can't believe the difference that makes"}
{"text":"Have been back a few more times now, the menu has not disappointed. The Motor Pkwy with added Jalapeno Cream Cheese is my current favorite. If you ask for the Traditional Jewish you are in for a delight. Coffee has improved since they first opened, the menus are all up and things seems to be operating smoothly. Has quickly become one of my favorite places in Medina."}
{"text":"Such friendly service and a welcoming environment! This reminds me of a bagel place I love in New York City. Great addition to Medina!"}
{"text":"Finally a worthy bagel joint in the area. The have Boars Head meats, somthing i have missed from NY."}
{"text":"French Toast bagels! They are great, big bagels with a great dual texture. The crunchy outside with a soft inside, perfect bagels.  Very well done. 

They use Boars Head Meats for the sandwiches which is excellent quality meats. This really makes the sandwiches a step above. 

Also try the Muffin tops. The best part of the muffin , but gigantic! 

The place is a little cool, cafe with NYC art and decor. Pretty cool little place indeed. Worth a try if you like bagels!"}
{"text":"The bagels and sandwiches and cream cheeses here are very good. The service is also not bad. You will not be disappointed with taste. However, The prices here are outrageous! The bagels are good but they are definitely not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Nice place in Medina off of Route 18 and just a little west of 71. Clean place with some tables for in-house dining and outdoor seating during warmer months. 

Has signs with named sandwiches referring to places in New York. When ordering, like I do when visiting New York, I ignore the names and just say what I want. 

Pastrami on rye is my favorite sandwich there. Morning bagels are solid, if not Manhattan quality bagels. The lox is a good option for salmon fans. I ask for half the usual amount of cream cheese. Coffee is above average, but not at coffee house level. 

Staff has been uniformly pleasant to me. They're what I call deli friendly: quick how-do-you-do, take your order and get your order started."}
{"text":"I went there when it open and the bagels were actually decent (I am from NYC) the second time bagels were horrible and undercooked. I figure OK bad day. Third time the bagels sucked and the danish were old and dry not only that but the people were rude. I went in for a fourth time early in the morning and the only bagels they had were garlic or onion? Come on! I will never go back to this place! What a shame! People running this place seem to have no idea how to run a restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every time I walk in I feel like I am in New York City. They have a great friendly staff, large, easy to read menu, and the best of all, their food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Customer service is always great, and you can basically order anything off the menu and you will be satisfied.  Their cream cheeses are homemade and they are incredible.  Everything is made with a high quality meat and the bread you can tell is always fresh.  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for bagels, never again. I will not be returning. Why? Over priced, bagels had zero taste, and the cream cheese was so bland. And, the employees were eating while getting my food!Very disappointed! Panera has better bagels and cream cheese. In fact if you want awesome bagels and yummy cream cheese go to Barry's Bagels in Avon! Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Thank God someone brought great bagels to my town

And as a bonus finally I can buy some cold cuts from boars head 

because all this presliced crap in all the so called food stores are worthless

Great sandwiches and what a variety
Great breakfast stuff too"}
{"text":"Great Fresh bagels!  Extensive menu, friendly staff.  My new go-to breakfast stop.  The lox cream cheese is my favorite.  Trust me, you will throw rocks at Dunkin' Doughnuts bagels."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and bagels! Authentic New York deli, even down to the lack luster, crap attitude of the staff that waited on me. Which is why you get 2 Stars.    I suggest the pastrami. ...with a side of grumpy!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place a bad review, but it's totally necessary, because good food is not the saving grace of a restaurant. I've eaten here once before, and it was good. On Saturday, we called in an order and I picked up. When I called in, the lady who took the order repeated it back to me. So I safely assumed it would all be right. I should have checked the order before pulling out of the parking lot. Two of the three sandwiches ordered were wrong. Wrong bagel on one, wrong meat on the other. We called in, and were told we could come back. No big deal. Five minute drive. Went back, and encountered the rudest woman. She refused to admit that she screwed up the order, and denied ever repeating the order back (because that makes screwing up the order okay). She wanted to know why we didn't bring the sandwiches back. You can't serve those sandwiches, you can only throw them out - so why would we bring them back? We only wanted one sandwich replaced. Wrong bagel, not the biggest deal. Sausage instead of bacon? Big deal for someone who doesn't like sausage. Want a new sandwich because the person taking the order screwed it up? You have to pay for it. Which is what ended up happening. She made us pay for a new sandwich, and then stood in the back, whispering and glaring like middle schoolers while the sandwich was being prepared.

Previous issues with wait times were easy to get over because the food was worth waiting for. But staff with horrible attitudes who treat their customers really, really poorly (and that's putting it nicely), is a done deal. We won't be going back, and we will no longer rave about this place to people we know. Even if you don't think you screwed up, you don't treat your customers the way you did. And you certainly don't tell them they can drive back, only to treat them so poorly and make them pay for a new sandwich. You lost a few customers this weekend."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sandwiches are great.  Finally tried the bagels and wasn't disappointed.  This will be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Great concept, terrible execution. I've been here a handful of times and each time I have been disappointed. I was extremely excited to see this place open up here too. Every time I have gone my order has been messed up, I've had to wait at least half an hour for a single sandwich, and deal with staff who don't know what they are doing or even how to answer simple questions. Now I gave them the benefit of the doubt, opening a new restaurant isn't easy and those problems are bound to happen. But every single time I've gone (and I've came back when they weren't busy at all to see if service was better) I've had to wait 30+mins only to get my order back and half stuff missing or prepared wrong. I hope you guys can get it together because I see potential for this to be a great breakfast spot! Until then, I am not wasting anymore money here."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic NY style bagels and deli sandwiches! Friendly staff. Reasonably priced. They use Boars Head deli meat and even sell it by the pound."}
{"text":"Walks in and ordered a dozen bagels sliced with a couple of things of cream cheese. I love that quick and speedy service. My family and I will enjoy these bagels on our way to Cedar point."}
{"text":"Very good place five stars and beyond I travel 79 miles to come to this place. I highly recommend it. Very good food. And great service. Check this out"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great reviews of this place. I have been there over 15 times and have had nothing but great service and quality sandwiches. My tip would be if you expect to be in and out in 5 minutes either go to a fast food drive through or have your order prepared and don't spend 10 minutes looking at the menu and complain about the wait. I can't honestly tell you what the average wait time is as that is the last thing on my mind when waiting for a great meal. Keep up the great work guys/girls. Much needed addition to Medina."}
{"text":"I have tried their bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and cookies.  They have the best cream cheese I've ever had.  The cookies were good and the breakfast sandwiches were OK"}
{"text":"Very fresh quality with a selection that is endless. Your food is made fresh to order and the presentation is excellent. I had a breakfast sandwich and my child (a picky eater) had an omelet. We both loved it and the portions are huge. The reason that I only have four stars are the bagel selection is almost depleted by late morning."}
{"text":"NY bagel deli has something for everybody! I've been here multiple times and each time I get something different but equally fresh and delicious. They have breakfast sandwiches, ginormous muffins and cookies, lunch sandwiches, fresh bagels and a variety of cream cheeses just to name a few things. I have even had a fresh spinach salad here and that was one of my favorite items! The prices are very fair considering the quality you receive. It's family owned and they are always nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Made two visits within the last 4 days. Incredibly impressed with the bagels and the integrity of a good bagel. Growing up in the northeast, you understand good Italian cuisine, bread and especially bagels. The owner is super friendly and recognized that I was from the northeast once he recognized my college hoodie and we got to talking about growing up in northeast PA. The bagels we ordered are AUTHENTIC and something you will not find in northeast Ohio...makes me feel right at home. Atmosphere, friendly service and delicious bagels makes for a great place to patronize. Will be a return customer for sure! Thanks so much!"}
