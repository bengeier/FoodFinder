{"text":"SERIOUSLY THE BEST JUMBO WINGS EVER!!!the staff is amazing too! Friendly family sports Steelers pub! We used to travel 30 miles for jumbo wings... never again!  Buffalo sauce was perfection! Wings tender and juicy! Had a burger tooo...unbelievable!  Best dinner in a long time.. be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wrong address Yelp!! It's located at Forest Hills Plaza on Ardmore Blvd, beside Jody B's! Great service, best wings I've had so far in PGH. Prime Rib was good. Best kept secret in Forest Hills! However, you'll never find it on Forest Hills Rd."}
{"text":"First time there. We got yelled at because we came in the wrong door. We came in through the bar entrance. In fact two people told us we did it wrong. Basic food , service average. I would only visit if it was the only place open."}
