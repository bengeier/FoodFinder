{"text":"My favorite sandwiches in the world are from Arizona Bread! I have been going there at least 15 years and I am never disappointed. The bread is delicious and the meats are cut fresh in store. The meats are not thin cut deli (processed) meat but actual turkey breast sliced thick (for example). I moved away for college and always came back. Now I live in Ahwatukee and I try to schedule any appointments around lunch near the restaurant! They greet me by name and I think the portions are huge and so reasonable. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great small business where the service is efficient and friendly and the food is good. It's got some of the best bread to be found in the Phoenix area and the sandwich ingredients are always fresh. My fav is the Sedona- nice flavor with the green chilies and special AZ mayo grilled- mmm mmm! Been coming here for years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite sandwich shop in the greater Phoenix area.  

Aside from the sandwich's being fresh and fantastic, it is a family owned shop and the \"mother/daughter\" team is always on hand to take your order with a smile. 

What keeps me coming back for more?  1) The Monterey with side of Ruffles originals and a crispy dill pickle and 2) The punch card...double stamp Mondays make it all worth while!

If you haven't had a chance to stop by this quaint lil' place, I suggest you do!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich to go, gave the Girl my name and when my order was ready I heard a lady say a name that was totally unrecognizable to mine. How hard is it really to get someone's name right?!!! After that I looked around, and waited. My three year old was sitting with me eating his cookie he got so I got up slowly and walked over to the counter. I said do you mean Malena, I say I didn't even understand what you were calling out. One of the older ladies who were calling my name out said well if your name sounds like it you need to get up and come get it. I said no, I didn't understand you old lady.... I mean really- telling me a mom of four boys that I need to come when my name is called even when it doesn't even sound like it???!!!! So rude the old lady working there was! And she was even pointing her nasty old finger at me! Not nice customer service at all!!! I think that will be our last time coming! Great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but the service was terrible. I got a sandwich to go. 15 minutes later, everyone that had ordered after me had received their food, so I went to the front and the kitchen asked if I was waiting for anything, I told them I was waiting on a sandwich and they told me I was not and they had no ticket for my sandwich, as she's telling me this, she is eating chips right in front of me while making my sandwich. The manager was very nice, gave me a free drink and apologized. Paying 9 dollars for a sandwich isn't worth it."}
{"text":"The soups here are sooooo good, better than mom's!  The garden vegetable is fantastic, it has a wide variety of vegetables in it, not just the standard. Their bread is also fantastic, I love the kalamata olive."}
{"text":"I've had two experiences with the older woman that works there just being unnesssecarily rude. First, they were out of drink carriers and i purchased four drinks for a company luncheon. I asked her if she could help me carry them to my car and she said \"Oh no, absolutely not, it's too busy. You'll be fine to carry them.\" I wish i was joking about this!! I looked at her in disbelief and luckily a gentleman helped me to my car. The second time, i called in an order and spoke to her. She asked me to talk loudly into the phone because it was loud there and she couldn't hear, so i did. Then my volume must have dipped down because she yelled \"I TOLD YOU TO SPEAK UP!!\" Like i was a child or something!! Unbelievable!! No complaints about the food or other staff, but WOW i have never dealt with such horrifying customer service from someone in the food industry. Sad. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The wide variety of delicious soups and the sandwich creations on a choice of delicious freshly baked breads make this family owned shop a great place to stop by for a quick and tasty lunch.  We have been there numerous times and have had almost every kind of soup.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been coming to ABC for years and I have never had a bad experience. It is a wonderful little sandwich shop and everything is always fresh! 

Skip the sandwich chains and go to ABC!"}
{"text":"I don't live or work near this place, but I make the trip from downtown Phoenix once in awhile because it is that good.  It's a good place to take friends because there's something delicious for everyone.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  There are only a few ingredients to choose from, nothing too fancy, but sometimes that's all you need.

I always get the veggie sandwich on rosemary bread, with chips and a pickle.  I crave this sandwich.

While this place is so delicious I go out of my way to drive there, I didn't give it 5 stars because there are some simple ways they could improve.  I don't like sodas or bottled drinks, and it would be nice if they offered some fresh drinks like juices or lemonades.  And they could keep the dining area a little cleaner.  I take it they are a bit understaffed because they are not always on top of that.

Overall, though, it's a must-visit place for sandwich lovers."}
{"text":"The surly girl behind the counter acted like we were imposing every time she had to explain that they were out of everything except one option after asking us which option we wanted.just based on service alone I wouldn't ever go back again."}
{"text":"Best soup and sandwich in the valley! My mom and I come here all the time. Our favorite is definitely the chicken chili. This is the one place that is always friendly and the good is fresh. I highly recommended this place for your soup, sandwich and fresh-baked bread needs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Whenever I'm in town visiting my family one of my first stops is to Arizona Bread.  Everything is homemade - from the soups to the breads.  The food is great and the sandwiches are ginormous.

My personal faves are the rye, apricot/walnut and 9 grain.   It's rare in a world of samey types of restaurants to be able to eat at a family owned place where the food and the service are stellar.  

I know I'm a bit of a fanboy in my love of Arizona Bread Company but trust me  -- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey blt. They didn't even bother to cook half the bacon. They put enough meat for a gerbil. And the bacon that was cooked was so cold I wouldn't doubt it just came out of the fridge. This is the worst sandwich that I have ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes on. Also. The avacodo that was supposed to be on here? Brown. The one single sliver they put on one side of the sandwich was straight brown and mushy. What kind of business is this? I have avoided eating here but my boyfriend sent it to me for lunch. I will now not be eating until I get home. In 6 hours. Awesome."}
{"text":"I work across the street and I am in love with this place!  In addition to their fabulous sandwiches which are all on bread which is baked fresh daily, they have 8 different homemade soups that vary from day to day.  This place is also very inexpensive, half a sandwich (which may as well be a whole, its so big!) is only $5.  They also changed their hours so are open to 5pm each day.  You can also order bread for parties from them, and the bread is always made the day you buy it.  If you're in the mood for a sandwich or a hearty bowl of soup, this is the best place in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I go to this sandwich shop regularly. The size of the half sandwiches are outrageous. The owner Amy is always greeting customers and is overly friendly. I love the selection of bread and buy a loaf regularly. My favorites for toast with honey? Apricot Walnut or Cranberry Orange. Also, the soups are great but I gotta wait till the cool weather returns."}
{"text":"The soups here are AMAZING!!!!! I had a horrible cold a couple of weeks back, the waitress prepared an order for me of the chicken noodle soup, I've recently become vegetarian and didn't want the chicken so she simply made the noodles with the broth and also put in an order for the vegetable soup. I can honestly say they were both some of the best soups I have ever had and their bread is freshly made. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Still a solid place for soup and stuff, but now I have an issue with the employees plopping themselves down to eat in the dining room during their shift. I do not know of any other places where a cook or worker just takes their lunch (and a customer table) during the shift and then they get back up and go back right behind the counter. One younger chef was wearing shorts and an apron and he looked like he rolled out of bed and started making soup. This is very poor look and feels like the employees are out of control. Get them a table out back because unless the employee is finished for the day, they don't belong in the main dining room."}
{"text":"I believe it's the best bread in AZ.  Sourdough is amazing. Had a veggie-build -your-own sandwich and added avocado and bacon....amazing!  Great Tazo black iced tea. My friend had chicken lentil soup and loved it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok so you see I have been here 33 times since my first visit. Probably more since I don't always remember to check in. Had the tomato and rice soup today. Yummy on a chilly day. I drive about 8 miles from my house to get here. I love it that much. It is fresh and healthy food. I bring visitors here as well. My kids love it. It is clean and always had positive energy! Still continued to be my favorite soup and sandwich place! Kudos!"}
{"text":"My family loves Arizona Bread Company and we've been going for years. Soups, salads, sandwiches and great, fresh bread. Even fresh cookies and Rice Krispy Treats for desert. This is a great, family-owned business."}
{"text":"I went in and had an egg salad sandwich, and my daughter had a turkey sandwich.  The sandwiches were okay, nothing stellar by any means.  It was a nice little sandwich shop, service was great, but my egg salad had hardly any flavor at all.  I had to pour the salt on to get some flavor to it.  The turkey was just standard sliced turkey, nothing special.  Long drive, would never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious Arizona chili and fresh bread heaven!"}
{"text":"We love their breakfast for lunch on the weekends until 2pm.  The iced tea is good.  I like the ranch breakfast with 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, and lots of toast.  They also have bagels and are generous with the cream cheese.  The banana nut break is great.  Lots of salads and sandwiches available as well.  

Staff is very friendly and the owner likes to come chat with you.  Dogs are welcome on the patio and are given water.  It is a nice place for lunch!  You order at the counter and they bring your meal to you."}
{"text":"I just picked-up a loaf of souurdough and zuccini bread at the Phoenix Public Market. I am so impressed with the quality of the breads! The people who helped me at the market were also SUPER wonderful. I will certainly be purchasing more from this company in the future."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars but I don't want to give the wrong idea by rounding up to 4...

I finally checked out Arizona Bread Company this weekend after passing by it many times.  I'm very much a sandwich kind of gal (dare I say a sandwich connoisseur?) and I was very very pleased with the Santa Fe panini on olive bread.  Turkey, melted cheese, green chilies, the whole deal.  The tuna salad I tasted was delicious too, as was the challah.  I noticed they have daily sandwich specials and I also like that you can get many of the sandwiches as just a half sandwich.  The atmosphere is nothing special (many many notches below, say, Paradise Bakery), but this would be a great place to pick up lunch during the work day - if only I worked nearby!  Check it out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Arizona bread Company rocks for lunch for 20 years food is fabulous I don't know what people are complaining about where can you get European hard crusty bread to buy and for sandwiches only here! Huge tuna fish salad sandwich with Fresh veggied and choice of cheeses and spreads along with chips or pretzels. Nobody can match their soups here done by a guy who has been here 15 years! Salad & half tuna sandwich is less than 10 bucks with side bread too!
Also less than 10 bucks for full size white albacore tuna salad and what you want on it! Tuna salad is off the hook!! Family owned and run! They bake so much killer bread for sale too! Yes water does taste weird from fountain!

Well back again !
The tuna rocks  again for $6.55 for half sand which is huge, had pretzels no chips today I was good comes with pickle too and today the place was packed!
Pictures included of my last visit.
5 stars family run place!"}
{"text":"Was craving a BLT so I thought I would give this place a shot since I live across the street. Lots of options for bread but I am not a bread person, I rarely eat it and don't feel one way about the flavors. I ordered the BLT on wheat and th cashier asked me what sides I want: chips and salsa, potato chips. I though that was weird because I could have sworn the sign said the sandwiches came with a side salad or veggies. My boyfriend ordered the cesar salad,

The sandwich was good, lots of bacon and a good size. The chips and salsa were cheap like cafeteria level. Cheap salsa I am pretty sure was Pace.

Bf's salad: Mediocre at best but still edible.

The place needs a little extra attention in its interior and menu ingredients. I would love to have a good cafe close to my house."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town! The food is always served really fast and the portions are always huge, so they won't go home hungry (I always have leftovers). And their pretzels with honey mustard are yummmmy!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE, been coming here since i was in 7th grade. I come here almost daily for lunch now, the food quality is very high and its delicious. i love the breakfast sandwiches, and will always love my southwest salad! I hope they stay in business for ever."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Phoenix Public Market on Saturday mornings. I buy from a variety of different vendors, but Arizona Bread Company is always my first stop. I am addicted to the Kalamata Olive bread.  It never disappoints. I love it toasted with a little butter, or even as a sandwich. I also enjoy brushing it with some olive oil, cutting it up into squares, and toasting it to make croutons. They actually sometimes make it into my salads.  I highly recommend this and the other breads they offer."}
{"text":"Always good. They know me by name because I go here so often. Great bread, sandwiches and soup. I prefer to go in the afternoon as they tend to get a little busy around lunch hour and I like to call in my order ahead of time."}
{"text":"I was sold at \"fat free tuna fish.\" There aren't many sandwich shops that make tuna fish sandwiches with fat free mayo and yet it's so simple to do so! Luckily, Arizona Bread Company has this mastered and knows how to make a tasty tuna fish sandwich on their soft and delicious bread. 

Arizona Bread Company is simple in looks but their bread speaks wonders. It's freshly made, very soft and flavorful. I especially like that they have a variety of different breads to choose from. I even noticed a chili bread! The sandwiches here are good and it probably has something to do with the bread, which makes all the different in the world. The staff is friendly and fast and they have plenty of seating options inside the deli. This is a great lunch spot and one where you'll get in and out in no time...and with a good sandwich in your belly!"}
{"text":"Nice place, nice atmosphere, and I've always had good service here but - for me - the bread is mediocre. I'm guessing they are intending to go for a very moist, 'heavy' bread, which I'm sure some people love. I've just discovered Wildflower Bread Company and their bread is 'perfect' for me - drier, lighter, but still with moisture and 'stretch' or 'bite'."}
{"text":"I use Arizona Bread Company's Chili Cheese bread to make THE BEST savory french toast EVER! I use salsa for the \"syrup\" and sprinkle some roasted pumpkin seeds on top for a crunch. It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Always busy. Great service and staff. A great place to meet up with friends. Overall one of my favorite soup and sandwich places."}
{"text":"The only reason I am writing this is in hopes that someone at AZ bread company may see it, and hear me out.

I think they have some quality stuff here, but I am giving a two star review for one reason (wish I could give 2.5). I cannot stand the chicken used in their salads. It has NO seasoning, very dry, and seems to have been sitting in the fridge for quite some time. 

Some may argue that chicken is not what they specialize in and so it is to be expected, but honestly, it was so terrible that there is definitely room for improvement. 

Can you tell I am slightly bugged that I paid for a chicken salad, only to spend the first ten minutes picking the chicken out?"}
{"text":"My husband and son took a class this morning at the Beginners Edge Sports Training location that happens to be in the same shopping center as this restaurant.  I knew they'd be hungry after the class and I wanted to hear about it, so my daughter and I met up with them afterwards at AZ Bread Company for an early lunch.  

It was empty when we arrived... we should have taken that as a sign.  The staff was not the friendliest and the atmosphere was drab.  We ordered and sat down... I grabbed a highchair for my son and noticed it didn't really seem clean.  My husband brought us cups of water but we couldn't drink them; they tasted awful. 

Our food arrived and it was nothing special either.  The pretzels we chose as a side were stale.  The salad and sandwiches we ordered were just average.  The sides of bacon and avocado that I ordered were decent, as was the apricot walnut bread.  My son didn't like the cookie he ordered for dessert.  

More people started coming in as we were leaving, and I noticed a decent looking soup served to another customer.  Perhaps that is the way to go?  Even so, there are so many great dining options in the Valley, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"What a great local place!  I feel like Norm from Cheers every time I walk in the door (which is only 1x every 2 weeks or so).  The staff really makes an effort to get to know their customers by name.  The sandwiches are fresh and made to order with lots of veggies.  Their soups are unique and flavorful.  My favorites are italian stew and shepard's pie.  I like the nine grain bread but the chilly cheese is also yummy.  The portions are 
gi-normous.  I usually get HALF a sandwich and soup/salad...this lasts me 2 meals.   I'm pretty sure once you try it you'll never look at Subway the same again."}
{"text":"We had a delivery from here to my office. The delivery woman was extremely rude and very impatient when she had to wait approximately 3 minutes for the person to come to the front and pay for the order. The delivery woman kept saying how this was a waste of her time and how it was unacceptable for business. I think she forgot who the customer was in this situation!  I will be cautioning the people in the office to NOT order from here as I do not want to be exposed to such hostility again."}
{"text":"Stopped here recently at the last minute. The outside is unassuming, but wow is the food excellent!  Portions are generous too. My husband had the 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup. He had the vegetable soup. Of course I had to taste it. It was perfect! The cup of soup was more like the portion size of a bowl at other places. I had the grilled turkey and pesto sandwich. It's on homemade bread, made on site!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Can't go wrong with the soups, salads, or sandwiches. The only complaint is that it can get a little pricier than similar places, around $10-$11 for a sandwich and small drink. I can't wait to try breakfast here!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but was given a mission. For Thanksgiving, my host wanted Epi rolls.
I had never heard of them so had to do some research. After making several calls to various bakeries, I found them at Arizona Bread Company. My phone connection was terrible and the second time around I ordered the rolls.  I thought they were individual rolls. However they are like a French baguette only twisted. You can break off eight pieces of bread from the baguette.  I went to pick them up and staff were very friendly and explained the origin of the Epi roll."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed this place having lunch with my father. The prices are moderate but the quality is excellent. The drink choices are few but there are a lot of free side orders as well as delicious pastries and fresh Made bread. They also give you a stamp card two different kinds one kind especially for ordering food. After 5 orders you get a free drinking after 10 you get a free sandwich. I am very pleased with the Rice Krispie Treat I ordered was was made handmade and The BLT sandwich I had. You have the option of getting a half order or a whole sandwich which is nice. I would recommend this as a good lunch spot for anyone."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Delicious food and healthy options.  Took one star off (probably should be more) for seeing the employees who make the food touch everything (ex. boxes, door handles, to name a couple) with their gloves on, including scratching their head and not putting a fresh pair of gloves on before handling the food.  ABC, please give your employees a little reminder to put fresh gloves on before handling the food.   Everything else is perfect!"}
{"text":"The bread is nothing to write home about. Their sourdough is in name only the bread is French. Oh well."}
{"text":"It's just really, really good. Only get a half sandwich !
They are so big , it's really a whole. I get the AZ chicken salad sandwich on olive bread"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and it definitely isn't my last. The staff were beyond nice and friendly. You can really tell they appreciate your business. Wish every business treated their customers this way. Last but not least was the food. I had the roast beef sandwich with the chicken gumbo with sausage soup. Literally blew my taste buds out of this world. Every bite was delicious. The size of the portions you receive are big as well. I will be coming here a lot more after this wonderful experience. Thank you Arizona Bread Company Bakery & Cafe"}
{"text":"Note: the menu attached is wrong- not this restaurant but another with a similar name. People here are nice and food is simple but good- just be aware the linked menu is wrong (a fact the lady at the counter seemed frustrated by)."}
{"text":"Out of Towner, came for a late lunch on a recommendation.  Very jolly counter service, great upsell  on the home made queso (yummy).  Not so efficient on order taking, but it Was the guys first day.   Neither of our orders was right, but mine (basic ham and cheese etc)  turkey and cheese was on a DELICIOUSLY fresh Italian bread ,queso yummy.  Other sandwich with nothing she ordered looked yummy.  Pasta salad ok."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. I called in my order for delivery and the person (girl)who answered the phone was very rude and didn't  take down my order correctly and was very impatient to hang up. The delivery driver,which was an old lady, was also very rude ,impatient and very sarcastic. When I was filling out the tip portion, she started rolling her eyes. My sandwich was great, but they need to hire friendly people."}
{"text":"I am disappointed.  I have been going for years but recently had a bad experience.  The staff was extremely unpleasant and the one girl was talking about my mom to other patrons in store.  I really don't get it.  If i had people working for me like that they wouldn't be employed by my company.  

They have the best tuna in town though and I am sad that I don't know when I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts but wish the coffee was better. You'd think that'd be something they'd excel at.

The build your own omelet was very fresh and a good value. The potatoes were underdone and because they were cut to all different sizes, some more done than others.

Wish they had a patio!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Bread is made fresh every day which you don't find at too many restaurants. I created my own sandwich with chicken salad, tomato, avocado, sprouts and bacon on Italian bread! So delicious. The food came out fairly quick too. Everyone at the table (4 of us) loved their meal. Their maple scone was so delicious and so was the brownie. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it is a great spot for lunch and low key. I will definitely be coming here from now on!"}
{"text":"Sorry, AZ Bread, you suck. 

I ordered a salad and soup combo and got the big order of each. The upside of this is I had a salad for later. 

When my order was brought to the table (super fast), it was not only the wrong size (I know that I didn't say super size me), it was the wrong salad. Garden salad sounds nothing like Caesar. Back that went. The two bread rolls that came with the meal were hard as rocks and terribly bland.

I did not have the only incorrect order. At least three other tables near us were wrong. This was not a simple \"I have this person's meal and you have mine.\" These were just incorrect. 

Salmon chowder did taste like salmon, but nothing to write home about. The salad did go home and grew into that evening's meal for four of us (ok, I did add a few more items to it)."}
{"text":"Just as good as I remember! I used to order here in high school and into my early college years and the quality, service and sandwiches are the same... great! I used the YelpEat 24 App to order lunch online as I was finishing a few things up at work. I ordered the whole club sandwich on a baguette with chips. When I picked up my order the staff was friendly and ready on time. I opened the box and took a brief peek at my order. I didn't see a pickle and should have asked but assumed it was under all the chips wrapped in wax paper. Sadly it was not, nor was there onion on my sandwich as ordered. I just assumed all was well as the online receipt showed my order correctly. Other than that the sandwich was delicious! Glad to find a local family business still doing well after all these years and consistent in the taste and quality of their food!"}
{"text":"The 3-star review should have been 5 ... but ... even though the food was delicious the counter service was a less than pleasant experience. Arrived with a couple friends for Sunday brunch. It was around 11:45 am. Instead of a simple, \"we don't serve breakfast after 11 am\" the woman at the counter was roll-your-eyes sarcastic about being asked. I can't find fault with the food: it was very good, a generous portion (salad/sandwich combo), and the servers who brought the food to the table were courteous. Sadly, I think the woman with the attitude at the counter was the owner. I'll take my business to Wildflowers or Paradise Bakery, where the food is just as good and served without the side of sarcasm."}
{"text":"I love their rosemary bread!  I buy it every time I visit the farmers market.  So good!"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident and what an amazing find.  The hand made fresh, gourmet sandwiches n soups were outstanding.  My family enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"The bread was really good, the egg salad was decent but everything else was plain and lacked quality.  Service was very friendly  and welcoming.  I wouldn't go back.  Would have given 2 1/2 stars if possible because of service."}
{"text":"FIRST: So I head this way because I read their menu through yelp and it said they had a veggie wrap that sounded good by how it was described on the menu that is presented on THIS page, and I go down there to the location provided on THIS page, when I get there I can't find the wrap on the menu and I'm told that \"that is a different location in Tempe\" although it was on the menu for THIS location with THIS address. At this point I'm already here and I'm hungry so I settle.

SECOND: I will give an \"A\" for Politeness and Speed, the woman was kind and pointed out a similar item on the menu to accommodate my needs, I order a veggie Sandwitch on Sourdough with Dijon mustard, a side of chips, and a pickle and it comes out to around $7.50, not bad.

THIRD: I get the food shortly after (granted it wasn't busy or anything) I would say like 5 min later not bad at all, and it's a very good size Sandwitch, a nice helping of ruffles, and two pickle spears, so as far as the amount of food I got it was worth the price.

FINALLY: When I bite in to the Sandwitch I can NOT taste the mustard it tasted like there was none, when I open up the Sandwitch it was some type of home made mustard (which is usually pretty good and exciting to try) but it wasn't a traditional mustard spread, it was some type of mustard seeds? It was very very bland, and then the SOURDOUGH bread (the bread being what this place is known for obviously) tasted NO different from regular White bread, I'm almost positive there was a mistake and I got white instead, all in all it was very filling, the staff was kind, and the food came quick, not to mention the price point was not bad at all, but the Sandwitch tasted identical to something I would have made at home at a smaller price point, it was mediocre at best, I would not go OUT of my way to come back but if I'm in a pinch and it's within a quarter mile of my location I might go back."}
{"text":"One word. Meh. The Sedona panini is nothing to write home about. The turkey was an interesting color, and there wasn't NEARLY enough green chili to make this very very plain panini taste good. I even asked for some mustard just to put some flavor on it. The funniest thing was you could get chips and salsa as a side which I thought was a super cool idea. Boy was I wrong. The \"chips and salsa\" are pace picante and Tostitos  couldn't believe it. Also the vibes in there feel super unwelcoming to me, definitely would pass on this if I were you."}
{"text":"I just experienced a comedy of errors. While having lunch here, Gayl B and I watched the employees make at least three errors.

Firstly, our order was botched. The cup of soup became a bowl of soup, and the house salad became a Caesar salad. My beef sandwich looked good but the meat was both as tough as nails and totally flavorless and the honey mustard dressing was almost non-existent. 

At the next table over, both corned beef sandwiches were served with the incorrect side dish.

As we left we heard another customer saying that his order was wrong.

Fortunately, most of these sorts of errors can be fixed. However, first off the employees have to understand what is wrong and then be willing to fix the errors. I did not feel that there was any real desire to learn from the mistakes being made. Customer service needs a lot of work if this restaurant is going to remain competitive.

Not a good dining experience. Even though the bread had great flavor, the rest of the meal was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"So we ordered a vegetable omelet, they made us a frittata. The manager attempted to give us the frittata anyway and did not apologize. When i went to speak with an employee because we did decide to in fact get what we had originally ordered they argued with us stating it would just be a frittata turned over. The manager eventually made us what we had originally ordered but not without having to stand our ground, assert ourselves and insist on them making it right. Btw not once did someone say I'm sorry. Oh and...this happened not once but twice this happened to us last time we had come here as well (we just forgot and made the mistake of coming back again). Also very weak coffee. Long story short...service is terrible and coffee is weak."}
{"text":"Better than \"as good as it gets.\"  

I visit them at the Phoenix Downtown Public Market on Saturday mornings.  My absolute favorite thing they sell is the Italian w/Olive Oil Italian bread.  One loaf of that lasts about 24 hours in my house...and I live alone.  They run out of it early!  One week they ran out before I got there so I tried the Rosemary Italian.....I don't like Rosemary.....and I ate that right up too.  This past Saturday I expanded and bought their Rye (it's almost gone on Monday afternoon) and a pastry (they called it a long john but it was the size of my forearm) that was like a stretched out cinnamon roll....gone by bedtime.  I'm afraid to try anything else for fear of enormous weight gain!"}
{"text":"The AZ chicken salad was tasty, but very heavy in the mayo department. The bread I chose wasn't strong enough to handle the chicken salad and I had to eat my lunch in pieces. I loved the Italian rosemary bread. One issue, the customer bathroom is located through the kitchen. I just think it's weird you walk through the kitchen while employees are making food. I'd come back and probably try something different next time."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I truly love...it's a good sandwich. Arizona Bread Company does sandwiches so right. Gotta give credit to my boyfriend for bringing me here. 

First of all, I would highly recommend getting one of their combos where you can get a half sandwich with either a soup or a salad. It's SO much food for the price you pay and it's just wonderful. I love their chicken salad sandwiches. I'm one of those mayo people and they use a really yummy one to make their chicken salad. It's definitely mayo-ey and seasoned so well! And to be honest, it's the only sandwich I've had there so far because I love it so much. I get it on the Honey Wheat bread and it's just perfection. The side salad is big and could be a meal on it's own. You can choose between a garden salad and a caesar. The caesar has the giant homemade croutons on it. The garden has a lot of veggies in it like tomato, red onion, snap peas, cucumber, mushroom, carrots..etc. Lastly, the meal comes complete with either a side or chips, pretzels, or chips and salsa. It's a well rounded meal to say the least. 

Now my boyfriend is seriously in love with their Italian with Rosemary bread. He said it just makes his sandwich and it's his favorite bread in the whole world. He usually gets it with turkey and toppings. He usually goes for the soup and today he got to try Shepherd's Pie soup which he loved. 

Today when I went in there, I tried one of their sugar cookies on my way out. The staff was so friendly and complimented me on my choice. It was just as a sugar cookie should be, soft, buttery, and a little chewy. 

There's still so much I have to try on their menu but this might hold a top spot on one of my favorite sandwich places in the valley."}
{"text":"The Greek salad was delicious and generous in size for a moderate price. The rice and tomato soup was good too. This place specializes in bread and their calamata olive bread goes well with the Greek salad."}
{"text":"This was an interesting little place and random find on a busy day of running errands.  I stopped in for some challah bread and decided to have lunch. The menu was a little confusing and the cashier was nice but not overly helpful.  Felt a little dumb and explained I had never been in before.  The menu kept saying choice of side but the sides weren't listed. When I asked she pointed to the counter where the sides were listed....because of course that's where they'd be instead of on the menu  I ordered the Tempe grilled cheese panini and chips which also was the special of the day so it came with a free drink.  It was large and filling and overall very good! I wish I had gotten a cup of tomato soup to go with it.  

The highlight of the visit was watching the food supplier run in and out with the dolly loaded with supplies.  Because he was hot. 

I'd eat here again.

*disclaimer if the sides were on the menu then excuse me for being an idiot."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The AZ chicken salad is my favorite.  Been coming here for years!"}
