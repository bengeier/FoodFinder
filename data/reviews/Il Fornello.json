{"text":"I've been here many times over the years and the quality of food has gone down hill.   My most recent experience:  Had a get together with a few of my friends a while back - we came here because it was close to home.   I had a pasta dish - I'm not sure how an Italian restaurant can mess up the most basic thing: cooking the pasta so that it is no longer raw. Well it happened. I couldn't finish my dish and was quite upset given this is not the first time where I had a disappointing meal here.  My friends had pizza - nothing special. Like someone had mentioned in another review - for the price you pay you you expect to be impressed.   Needless to say I've given enough chances - won't be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I visited il Fornello's, but I'm glad I did. I was told there was a 15 minute wait for the dining room, so we decided to eat in the bar. Service was quick and attentive. Food was amazing, wifey loves the Margarita Pizza. Will comes again."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and honestly struggle for a quality neighborhood restaurant. This place is above par and quality is fantastic. The waitress was young so didn't understand timing however the manager was spot on attentive and high quality. Great wood oven pizzas as well. Definitely worth it and affordable."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night for a table of 8 celebrating a joint birthday! Reservations were made just the day before and the restaurant was very accommodating.  Food: Our table got a variety of dishes ranging from the lamb, Gnocchi Gorgonzola, pizzas, and what I ordered - PENNE CAPRI. I don't know if my expectations/standards for pasta are low - but this was the best pasta dish I've had in my life. Seriously. The penne was cooked perfectly and you could just tell by the TASTE alone that the pasta was made in-house, which is then validated by a walk to the washroom as you pass by the open-concept chef's area. From what I could tell, everyone at the table loved their food - which is a rarity in my friend group of picky eaters and dietary restrictions. It's an amazing feeling spending time with your friend group celebrating and everyone is relishing in culinary nirvana.   Service: SERVICE WAS IMPECCABLE. Unfortunately, I arrived late and didn't get a chance to hear our waiter introduce himself, but he was so patient with our rowdy group. A bunch of us were constantly whispering in his ear the various requests for the birthday boy & girl, and he gladly listened with a smile. One of my friends requested a special whipped cream + shot concoction and he fulfilled the request - no questions asked. When I paid, he even reminded me that gratuity was already included (tables of 8 or more I believe?), and recommended I skip the \"tip\" step.  *The only thing I'd note is on the night of our visit, the washrooms were a mess, but I think it had to do with some construction going around in that area of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location across the street from Roy Thompson Hall. We were first ones seated last served. The bread basket consisted of a couple of small slices. The  Fett. Alfredo  arrived noodles were poorly cooked - the serving was cold had to be sent back. The waitress had attitude ... and the service was poor. I will not be back very disappointed."}
{"text":"Server forgot to bring our appetizer and wanted to bring it after we had finished our entrees. After some negotiating, manager finally agreed not to charge us for the food we hadn't received and hadn't eaten. This place is a joke. With so many better options in the neighborhood, why bother with this place?"}
{"text":"I would almost go four stars because Il Fornello tolerated our large party remarkably well (it took a long time for everyone to settle down enough to put a dinner order in). Of course, when asked what the house Rose was, our server answered \"pink\".  . . . Which kind of just meant that we had to order it once we were done with the house white ($32, not terrible, not delicious).   The crust here is good enough that those who usually spurn the extra crust will dredge it in oil and vinegar. The toppings on the various pizzas we ordered were good quality but overpowering, had I sampled them with a dull smokers tongue they probably would have been most delicious."}
{"text":"Having just moved here form Montreal, I was more than thrilled to find the charm of the Beaches...Unfortunately, I picked a pretty lame lunch place. The service wasn't great and the soup and salad tasted as though their route was thwarted on the way to the olive garden. Disappointing. Although I didn't have the pizza."}
{"text":"A nice little casual restaurant in Bayview Village. The service is good and the menu is not too expensive. The meatball appetizer is delicious and very filling! It's good to share. I like their pizza's because they are thin crust, my favourite being the pizza salmone! Their Atlantic salmon main is also very good!"}
{"text":"Often a plate of lettuce with a couple pieces of tomatoes is called a salad by a restaurant. BUT at Il Fornellos's the salad was awesome. They combined some really great flavours and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would definitely order it again.  The Chicken that I ordered though was tough and hard, and way overcooked.  Service was good, and we had a great table by the window (a good spot to people watch!!)."}
{"text":"I've finally given up on Il Fornello. My husband and I have vowed never to eat there again after our last experience. Mind you, that was the third bad experience we'd had at the place.   The service is always mediocre at best with servers so nonchalant in their service it's practically non-existent. The food lacks flavour. Every time. The pastas are dull, the pizza alright, the lasagna is dull, the caesar salad is boring, the caprese salad is okay. It was just a disappointing experience time and time again.   And it is ALWAYS overpriced. I would always leave feeling guilty about spending so much money on such a disappointing meal.   So, never again!"}
{"text":"Popped into Il Fornello with my fiancee at around 7PM on a Saturday. The place was decently busy but we were seated immediately and had fantastic service the entire night.   We had the standard bread, balsamic and olive oil at the table along with a bottle of sparkling water. I had a Peroni while we waited for our food, We also ordered the bruschetta, which seemed freshly made and was so refreshing in this weekend's heat we asked for a second order to go, to take home at the end of the night.   I had an excellent sausage, black olive and cheese pizza, and my fiancee had the lasagna. Both mains were fantastic, and I have to admit that I've never had a bad experience here.   We'll definitely be back, and hopefully get the same waiter who kept us chuckling all night too."}
{"text":"Tables were so close it was as if everyone in the restaurant were sitting together. Needless to say, and also because the people beside us kept staring as if they never saw human beings before, it made the seating very uncomfortable. It reminded me a lot of Hell's Kitchen, and we waited about an hour and a half to be served, only to be filled up with stale bread in the mean time. When the food finally came, it was the only thing that pleased me, but was not special enough for me to go there again. Il Fornello did not live up to expectations, and especially the goals listed on their website."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. I had my (surprise) 30th birthday here last November and the service was amazing. They fit us all in, were attentive and friendly, and the food was delicious. I was super impressed and would recommend this place for any party or family gathering. I still go back regularly for the Fichi Pizza (absolutely amazing)."}
{"text":"We went first to this place upon opening. Portions were big. Prices were a little higher but manageable because of the quality and quantity of food. Now we have noticed quality and quantity have slipped and are quite disappointed only because we knew what this place use to be. Also we feel the prices don't match up to the quality and quantity served. We rarely come here now. And I mean rarely, only for events that we are invited to."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably tasty, but the portions were too small for the price.  I also notice other reviewers here writing of being offered bread with their meals.  None was offered to me or my guest. The service was borderline terrible in this place.  The girl who sat us at our table and who brought the food (not the waitress) was miserable and likely wouldn't have smiled and been polite if I had offered her $20 to do so.  Despite me being polite (as I always am) she was passive-aggressively hostile.  I'd say thank you to her and she would just walk away.   The waitress was passable, but never came to check if everything was all right with our meals (as most servers will do in restaurants) and we had to sit there well after being done eating and scan the dining room for her so we could flag her down for our bill. Even the greeter at the front desk was taciturn and seemed like he didn't want to be there.  I saw very few smiling faces among the staff, so I wonder why everyone is so dour around this place. The men's washroom was quite clean, so at least they are up to snuff in that regard.  Perhaps they should shut down the dining room and keep the washrooms open.  You blew it with me, Il Fornello.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to eat at this establishment a total of 3 times - 2 lunches and a dinner.  This place serves high quality classic Italian food the way you would get it in Italy (well not 100% but you get the point).  A lot of detail goes into the plating, portions and the flavours - which enhances the entire experience.  The environment is beautiful, quiet and blends it self nicely with the whole classic food theme.  The service is good - though I think the price is a tad on the high side - but for a night out its not bad for a nice dinner date.  In closing - if you think East Side Marios is amazing, your probably not going to like this place because its beyond your taste buds lol but if you think East Side offers sub par Italian food then your going to love this joint."}
{"text":"Food is good, especially the specials. Service can be quite slow."}
{"text":"Great! The garlic bread and chicken parmigani were amazing, but this place was way too expensive for what you get. A bit of a rip off"}
{"text":"Today I was thinking to eat something like pasta primavera, they don't have vegetables. This is the last time I'm going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. My brother and I went there in a rush but the waiter immediately put in our order for manicotti and penne alla norma; the food came out quickly and was delicious. We definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Out of towner, wandering King Street, trying to figure out where was good without Yelp's help by seeing how many people were at a place. Came in, it is delicious and beautiful!"}
{"text":"the food is great so are the drinks. if you plan to go on a holiday, dont expect to be seated right away. sometimes wait time is frustrating. my favourite one is the one on harbour front. never had a problem with any of the staff."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the pizza at this place.  My only complaints would be that we felt a bit rushed because of the long wait and it was a bit too warm. Would recommend reservations if you're going on a show night or weekend.  They give free baskets of bread to start, which is always nice. I looked around and noticed everyone's plates looking so good. Will try the pasta next time. A good choice for dinner in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable lunch at Il Fornello. We decided to have a quick lunch before the 2:00 matinee of the Phantom of the Opera. We had a very nice table by the window. My husband had the thin crust pizza with arugula and prosciutto which he enjoyed very much and I had the spaghetti and meatballs with slivers of Parmesan. The meatballs were just the way I liked them, a generous portion of medium sized meatballs (not too big) over an amount of spaghetti that was not too much. I was full enough, but not so much that I felt too full. Especially since we'd be sitting in the theatre right after we had our lunch.  We were served very quickly and we made it in plenty of time to see the show!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner tonight at il Fornello on the Danforth.  This restaurant is very clean, and the service is wonderful.  My wife ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, while I had the Steak.  Both were cooked perfectly.  Our server Liisa was very attentive, and was proactive in ensuring our needs were met at each step of our dining experience.  The portions are not overwhelming, and you get great value for your money.  The staff are very helpful.  All of the chefs are approachable, fun, and know their stuff.  They are all first class!  One in particular is James, who worked tonight on the appetizer and salad station.  James prepared us an excellent caesar salad and a wonderful creme brulee and tiramisu deserts.  The entire kitchen turned out as our overall experience was perfect.  I gave this restaurant 5 stars!  I will certainly come back again!"}
{"text":"Good selection of Italian foods.  I particularly like the all-you-can-eat buffet which includes soup, bread buns, salad, 4 types of pizzas, pasta, fruit and much more.  On weekends they also include french toast.  Lots of pizza selections or build-your-own pizza."}
{"text":"I won't be back here. This once was a regular spot for me. The staff and the food were a perfect symbiosis. A bonus, they used to carry an excellent gluten free crust without all the crap (corn, soy and ingredients spelled with numbers and x's'). Now they only carry the gluten free crust with the crap in it. I can get past that because they had loads of other good stuff on the menu. But, guess what? That also changed too and not for the better. They did some weird interior redesign and the cozy feel is gone. Sad."}
{"text":"Appetizers were pricey. The mains were a fair/good price. Cocktails lacked alcohol. Scene was quiet, but would make a romantic dinner spot.  See my full review for pictures and exact prices:  http://atoronto.blogspot.com/2013/10/italian-dining-at-il-fornello.html"}
{"text":"For trying to go as a group this doesn't work. Not being able to make a reservation for a party of 12 means I will never go here as a group. (This was for a weekday work team lunch.)"}
{"text":"I went to Il Fornello a few weeks back one evening with several friends for a few drinks and a small bite to eat. We stayed late into the evening and close to 9:30pm, just before the kitchen was closing, I ordered some fried calamari. It came out immediately but was soggy and rather elastic in texture.   The next four days was spent in bed recovering from a BAD case of food poisoning. I did call Il Fornello to let them know what had happened and received an apology... but that's about it. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Wait staff were good despite it being busy and wait times were alright.   All our pizzas were a little burnt in spots and the knives were so blunt, none of them would cut without just tearing the food apart.   Pizza fichi is the best with figs and honey.   Bit expensive.  Only reserve tables after 8 but you can do it through their website."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian restaurant!! I have been many times with my girlfriend and we have never been disappointed. The must haves are the diavolo pizza, fettucini alfredo, linguini dimare and fig pizza. Great service and very friendly staff! Will continue coming here for a long time."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day had the chef's special lasagne and salad for $10.50 - amazing! Atmosphere was great, service superb, and the menu was extensive and very reasonable. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Totally NOT impressed with this place!  Had the risotto, which I love, but not this one. It tasted more like dirt than mushrooms and was a complete disaster. I ate 10 bites and gave up.  Service was fine, wine was good, but they should learn to allow couples in conversation to just enjoy themselves without continual check ups!  Too many interuptions by the waitress to make even the conversation enjoyable. Tried it once but will never return"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick delicious meal? I recommend this restaurant. The pizzas are thin crust and delicious. The staff aren't the best though. For instance, last night our waiter asked my brother if he wanted extra mushrooms on his pizza. We assumed it was either free, or a small charge for that topping...rather, it was a 3 dollar charge for a tiny bit of added mushrooms.   Other than that, I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is not the Il Fornello I grew up with. I used to delight in their sun dried tomato pizzas, the best ceasar on town but no more. Now filled with noisy families, babies and toddlers, I feel more like I'm at a Kelsey's or Olive Garden. The food now mirrors these restaurants as well. And my beloved sun dried tomatoes? Not even on the menu anymore. The end of an era ..."}
{"text":"First time at Il Fornello was for lunch. Sat by the window and was very bright. Almost too bright given the white table settings and dishes. Food was good, not too busy for lunch but not dead either. Portions were a bit small but tasted good.   I had the spaghettini and lemon chicken and it tasted great. I would eat here again, but there are other options to choose as well."}
{"text":"I really like Il Fornello for many reasons. The atmosphere is nice, the service is friendly and the food is good. They're very accommodating and are willing to substitute. I ordered the veal limone with chicken and they were willing to do that without a problem. Great restaurant, although the service is a bit on the slower side and you'll need to make a reservation on the weekend."}
{"text":"I thought that my pizza was surprisingly good, if a little bit greasy.  I highly recommend it: the Gorgonzola.  I heard from the rest of my party that their food was pretty good.  This place has a nice atmosphere, and we needed a table for 8, so it was a good choice.  They take reservations.    Overall, this was a good place to eat with a group of family members.  There's something for all the picky eaters - salad with generous helping of cheese, pepperoni pizza, chicken, etc.  It's a bit pricey, though; my pizza was around $16, and didn't come with anything (other than the free table bread).  On a petty note, I thought the bathroom was sort of run-down, which always surprises me in restaurants that are otherwise quite nice."}
{"text":"As a chain restaurant, the food here is decent and overall pretty good. The pizzas are freshly made and the highlight. I would recommend the Diavola and the mushroom pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times now and the food and service had been excellent. I've tried a number of different dishes and they've all been really well executed, so the quality seems consistent. The atmosphere is also quite pleasant. So the lower ratings seemed disconnected."}
{"text":"I ate at this establishment tonight and ordered the Oso Buco.   IT was very bland, the overall service was sub par.  The waitress indicated that she would call someone from the kitchen to address my concerns with my meal.   That person from the kitchen never showed up.   She was late with my drink and well we never saw her most of the night.    You'd' think after I did decide NOT to tip the waitress that perhaps that would ring a bell in her mind ...\"hmmmm...wait a second, this customer did not tip me...I wonder why?..hmmm...\"    I'd give II Fornello a few tips.  Greet your customers when they come to the front door and upon leaving.  Make it a point of truly trying to satisfy your customer and not just pay lip service.  Have management walk around and ask people how their meal is.  None of these tips are novel , they are common sense if your running a restaurant.  I use to be impressed with the level of service a year ago but its gone down hill ever since.   No one really comes by and truly cares whether your happy with your meal.     I'd think twice about going here again and would not recommend this place to others.  Luckily Richmond Hill has many other choices for restaurant's to offer.  I'd recommend others to try Faro Via, Felini's,  or Marcello's (in Woodbridge) as better alternatives."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but I find the food is very good it is comparable to Terroni downtown and tastes like very good authentic Italian food. the service is a little bit slow compared to some restaurants but I find that the atmosphere is generally fairly nice and most times you can get a table. They also have a wood oven which makes the pizzas taste delicious."}
{"text":"Great place, great food! Lots of choices but pizza is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday. The food was amazing. It's a little pricey. If you are looking for a great Italian Restaurant this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is fairly consistent. The food and service are ok and if you like predictability, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good- I'd do a 3.5 stars, It's more than A-Ok and less than Yay! I'm a fan. The food was pretty good- there wasn't a lot of depth of flavours in the food which normally I'm all for but it was even a little more bland and so-so than I usually opt for. They didn't have a ton of options, they had all your typical American-Italian options, we wanted to order a couple appetizers but they really had no options for decent apps. I had the Caesar salad and Fettuccine Alfredo, the fettuccine was a little bit drowning in the sauce and lacking in flavour. My bf had the lamb chops and found them very flavourful.   The drinks as well, very average. The wine selection wasn't super great nor was the wine itself and I ordered a martini that also wasn't fabulous but wasn't awful. The prices are decent, a little overpriced for the taste of food but just where I would expect a restaurant of their category to be.  The portions were a really nice size and the service was good, we had two servers, the first wasn't very attentive and kind of just chatting with the hostess majority of the time but the second who brought us our food was fabulous, she was cheerful and sweet and attentive. There was no wait and plenty of parking which was nice and we didn't feel as if we were packed in. But I keep remembering that the food was just average and the menu was just overage. Overall it would't be my first choice again in the future, it was just missing that something but would recommend to try it out."}
{"text":"Food is alright.. nothing special.  I don't see anything really italian about this place, that was a bummer.  Pricey, quiet/empty atmosphere. Don't think i'll ever go here again."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening was my second visit to this Italian joint and it was not disappointing by any means. I hate picking out where to eat when I am in a group of friends because I feel personally responsible if the experience isn't great. Thankfully, Il Fornello did not let me down in that department. We all started off with drinks and our server was prompt and efficient. Definitely mowed through 2 baskets of bread and once we got our pizzas it was no talking and only eating from then on. I was brave enough to go back for more and get the chocolate lava cake as dessert and it was probably the best decision I made this entire weekend."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month. We like their pizza. Their meatballs with garlic bread is good, but the serving size is small. Last night we had the Carne pizza and it had less meat than I would expect from a \"carne\" pizza - one pepperoni per slice and a little bit of ground meat.    I am a fan of the smoked salmon pizza, while my partner loves the pepperoni pizza. Their pizza is made in a wooden pizza oven, so they're pretty good. The lasagna tastes like the lasagna from the grocery store. The restaurant is usually packed on the weekends, so we tend to order because we have a baby and it's very loud and dark inside."}
{"text":"We were here on a wednesday evening. There was no waiting list and it didn't take long until we got our food served. I had gnocchis and my friend had cannelloni, both were very tasty.  The price was ok!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. The service was good. The food was sub-par. I had the gnocchi and my partner had some steak pasta dish. Not sure what it was called.   We started with a salad. It had golden beats, parsnip, arugula and pecans. This was actually very good and I almost wish I had just ordered two of these for my main course.   My gnocchi was awful. The sauce was so salty, I was literally scraping the sauce off the gnocchi. The gnocchi itself was alright, but the amount of garlic and salt made me wonder if she had sprinkled a tablespoon of garlic salt on it, instead of Parmesan. I ate about half of the gnocchi, and almost none of the sauce.   My partner is a sweetheart and almost never complains. It wasn't until we were on the way home he said he wasn't feeling so great. He had brought leftovers home and after he went to bed I felt like I needed a little snack. I took one bite and I cringed. I don't even know what to say. The shell pasta was under cooked. And I don't mean al dante. I mean it was a little on the crunchy side. I'm not sure what was up with the beef and sauce. Somehow this beef dish tasted like an under-cooked tuna casserole! Wtf?? It went into the trash can immediately.   It's a shame because the place seems nice and the server was very friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a good go-to restaurant.  Food is consistently good and there is a decent selection.   There are some terrible tables options, especially in the front section. Several little 2 seaters in the middle of an open floor, not very comfortable. So if you are going to this location definitely be conscience of the theatre schedules, it is a zoo before the show but about 15 minutes prior to curtain call you can pretty much walk in and get any seat. Worth the wait so you not only enjoy the great food, you can enjoy the experience as well."}
{"text":"Went here one night when trying to decide where to go. It's a quasi fancy restaurant that us surprisingly big. Good mix of options, although desserts are really lacking in options - sorry but yogurt with fruits is a laughable option to have on the menu."}
{"text":"This location is perfect for a lunch with clients or a dinner with family.  You are greeted at the front of the restaurant by a lovely hostess named Shaheen.  She is warm, kindhearted and extremely accommodating.  Shaheen is the main reason why I choose Il Fornello over all the other restaurants in the area.  Having been a long standing customer, it is so nice that the staff gets to know you on a first name basis and you are greeted by name.  The food is fabulous with lots of options for those that have special dietary needs.  The gluten free pizza is fabulous and a treat for someone who is Celiac.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't have the seafood pasta. Linguine de Mare. Seafood was way overcooked. you could use the scallops as erasers. My aunt warned me but I said. Nahh it's a well known reataurant in a nicer mall. Most things in Bayview village are she she fru fru.  Overcooking is one thing. But not offering a free coffee or a discount on the entree. I'll admit I'm somewhat cheap. So when I pay $20 for a lunch size portion of seafood pasta at \"nicer place\" in a fancier mall I would expect flakey scallops that melt in your mouth. And the squid was like compressed sawdust. Once you chewed on it super dry in the mouth.   Only reason I gave it 2 stars was cuz the coffee was quite nice. And well decorated. Just don't expect good pasta."}
{"text":"Very disappointing lunch. Food came out cold, I sent it back it and back and it was inedible. Inattentive server that didn't say \"thank you\" after I paid (with a generous tip). Watered down wine. I'm in shock this restaurant is still open. Just horrible. I am never returning."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service  Better food I had the lamb shank and it was delicious my date had the salmon and she enjoyed it as well"}
{"text":"Rubbery calamari and frozen tasting shrimp- See food linguine,  the good news, after they replaced my wife's meal, the new dish- veal was good"}
{"text":"Had the pancetta pasta and wife had the pizza. Both were delicious. Staff was very accomodating to our baby in stroller. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not worth the price. We were there for a birthday and had 17 people with a pre-ordered menu and each dish had enough for 2 people; they only had 4 dishes out. I personally won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Average food.  Very oily (literally dripping in it) pasta dish (with the homemade sausage).  Way too rich.  My companion had gnocchi with chicken and the chicken was not cooked (very pink with purple parts) and she nearly swallowed a bone.   Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is very good. Fine Italian dining experience. Great for a business meeting or date."}
{"text":"Happy to have Il Fornello out in Ajax, my Toronto buds are always surprised when I suggest we eat there, they can't believe there's an Il Fornello out here. I'm a consistent fettuccine alfredo consumer and my friends  eat everything else on the menu with gusto! I have also taken advantage of the $5 Margherita Mondays, an amazing deal!"}
{"text":"It's slightly less expense than most Italian places, so I don't expect much. If I wanted just a slightly above average restaurant, I'd go here. I wouldn't go here for anniversaries or for my bday. For a very casual date maybe, probably not for a first date.  Their bread is always hard; not really my style. Their pastas are filling for sure. Their service is good, just not great.  Really, everything about this place is A-OK"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Small portions. The kind of joint you leave somewhat hungry, unless you fill up on lots of bread. Not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends.  One of my friends almost swallowed a screw that was in her food.  The manger told us \"these things happen all the time in the restaurant industry.\". That is not what a customer wants to hear.  She the proceeded to tell us it was not a screw but rather a peice of a cleaning utensil.   I have called head office and left 5 messages in the last 2 weeks and no one has returned my call.  I think that the head office should know what happened and how we were treated in their restaurant.    I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with head office to ensure this doesn't happen again.  The owners's son was very rude to us, threatened us and even called the police.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"I would say the food is subpar to mediocre. We visited this restaurant last week with our family and shortly after eating, approximately 30 minutes later my wife became very ill after having a pizza with prosciutto .  The servers were very good but as the saying goes once bitten twice shy. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best. Tried the chicken asiago and it was really not something I would try again. My girlfriend got the pizza prosciutto , and it was not as great as we thought it would be. While the food is not horrible, it is not what you expect to get for the price. Giving the place two starts because I like the location."}
{"text":"Cousin Janet recommended this popular, friendly place. After a day of touring and wine tasting wanted salad and pizza. WOW neither disappointed. Pizza crust was thin and perfectly cooked with our sausage/mushroom toppings. Perfect. The large dinner salad was fresh and wonderfully surprising with small sweet delicious red peppers. What a treat. Thanks for squeezing us in Sat night as place was packed. We'll be back for pasta next trip"}
{"text":"We had an awesome server. First time here I like the ambience. I like their $10 pizza special but looking forward to trying their salmon pizza.  Interior design is rustic Lighting is not too dark Parking is free Big seating area I was served with house bread and chili oil as expected. I couldn't finish my pizza and they wrapped it up for me nicely. Its a good place to have a drink with friends.  I thought it was a bit pricey but the $10 pizza is the way to go. The salmon pizza that I wanted to get was not in that category.  Check out this photo for the pizza special sign by the pizza"}
{"text":"Service was fairly good for a busy Friday night and food was great. I had Alfredo with chicken which had a very rich sauce and everyone else enjoyed their meal no complaints and desert was amazing, the only thing was they used to serve better bread at the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here on Labour day! The patio is very pretty and the gnocchi was the best I've ever had! The service was excellent as were the Calamari and Ceasar Salad. Have to go back soon for the yummy looking pizzas."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Il Fornello this past Saturday night. Delicious food and friendly, attentive table service.  Only one complaint: We had made a reservation through Open Table on the Il Fornello website the day before. When we arrived at 6:30pm on Saturday for our reservation, they didn't have record of it. When I said I had booked it online through Open Table, the hostess thought I was simply asking for an \"open table\" and didn't have a clue what I was talking about. Finally she understood that I booked it online and said \"Oh, we don't always check that.\" ... What?! Anyway, luckily there was a table available for us and everything was great!   My advice to you is to call them if you're making a reservation because apparently they only check their online resos when they feel like it."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. However, I ordered the diavolo pizza and was disappointed; it was heavy on the (low quality) cheese and very sparse on all the other toppings. I have had this dish at other Il Fornello location's where it quite delicious and I had no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant and went on 3 different occassions.  Fettuccini Alfredo was bland.  Pasta was overcooked.   Bottom line, mediocre food at best.    Service is spotty.   The waiter on our second visit was fantastic.  Our waitress today was snotty and seemed bothered we were there.     Il Fornello is right in our neighborhood and a short walk from our home.  Sadly, I will never go back."}
{"text":"As I sit in the restaurant at the end of a bad meal, I normally might describe it as having left a bad taste in my mouth. In this case, it left no taste at all.  This meal was the definition of bland. The crostini with chevre and mushrooms might as well have been toast with cheese. The risotto with shrimp and peas was dominated by the lemon juice - it was that flavorless. The rest of my family was similarly underwhelmed by the flavor.   While the decor and ambience is pleasant, the prices are not indicative of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"You must try the grilled calamari. You absolutely must.   Il Fornello is a cozy little Italian place inside Bayview Village. Their lunch menu is consistently good, and the atmosphere is such that you almost forget you're in a shopping mall.  It's on the nicer end of casual dining. Manage your expectations accordingly. As noted by other reviewers, there are paper napkins and other telltale signs that youre not at the Ritz, but for a nice lunch in an area so ar north I would barely even consider it Toronto anymore, Il Fornello is lovely.  The service ranges between acceptable and amazing, and I've never had anything there that I did not like. The cannelloni could have used a bit more basil in the sauce, but was otherwise quite excellent. I can also vouch for the awesomeness of the bolognese, the chicken parm, and the gnocci. As mentioned above, the grilled calamari is better than sex. Texture is good, and its covered in tomatoey-olivey-caperey goodness and served alongside some leafy greens. SO delicious.  I'll admit the place is a bit pricey for a lunch --Usually ends up being $35-40 per person, with no booze- But if you can write it off as a business expense, I encourage you to do so.  A quick note on the location, (because my GPS couldnt find it the first time!!) --It's in the mall. Go in the doors by O&B ;)"}
{"text":"Second time, dry greeting, empty atmosphere, no house bread. Beets salad good, kids pasta and cheese pizza simple sauce and penne our meals both were pasta with chicken however chicken under cooked, didn't eat after one piece. Quite pricey based on location, cutlery missing from table they say us on. And missing napkins. All in and once a year huge maybe"}
{"text":"Consider this 3 1/2 stars!  We popped in at 10:00 pm on a Friday, and the staff were lovely enough to seat us (despite the fact that they were obviously about to close). Our server was very helpful and kind to us. Around the table we had 2 pizzas, a pasta and for myself, grilled octopus and the salmon.   - Both pizzas were flavourful, and atop a tasty, thin crust. ***1/2 stars! - The pasta was seasoned with thyme, garlic, etc and was delicious. **** stars! - My grilled octopus was perfectly blackened. The olives and spicy tomato chunks added great flavour. **** stars! - The Salmon (comes with spinach and roast potatoes) was simple but tasty. The portions are just right and I was very satisfied. ***1/2 stars!  This is, first and foremost, an Italian spot, so I would recommend against the salmon (or anything else basic) in favour of something that's more authentic. The pizzas are lovely, and the pasta is always tasty. That grilled octopus is what I'll be coming back for, though.  The reason for 3 1/2 stars versus 4 is that the place is sadly \"unforgettable.\" Their food is good, but it needs to be INCREDIBLE to make this a must-go. Needs a little update inside as well."}
{"text":"I admit it ... this is what you get for your money. $17 pre fixed lunch is not for me. It just didn't work."}
{"text":"I've been twice here and the food has always been incredibly delicious. Had pizza and pasta and both were really well done - nothing overly fancy but really good.  Some interesting pizzas on the menu - especially the fig one! (I think it's called fichi). Worth trying.   My problem - it is pricey but offers good stuff. I find it interesting to see people say that this is a place where you don't break the bank - guess I am just a cheaper guy in general :) - expensive is a relative term to many people. I find it more expensive than your average Italian - with just a small uptick in quality - hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.  Another problem - place can become packed easily and you could sit with someone right next to you, or in between coats (as someone mentioned before). Nothing major negative though..."}
{"text":"Place is clean I will give it that! Our server was a nice young girl very sweet!  Food over-priced for the portion given! I have no issue paying for a good meal no problem but when i pay the money and the portion is for a little kid...not happy!  I got the Gnocchi and yes they are large sized but there were 10 in my plate! I counted! 10!! My husband and some stuffed chicken and again not a large size, and was dry!  Wouldn't go back here!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. If you're looking for a good Italian place with relatively quick service, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bday party. Food was ok. Too much salt for my liking and at $30 you would assume they would make a portion that is filling to a man of my size. Then our server kept screwing up the bill with things that we did not order. Not cool and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today.   The food was delicous. Our server Marc was the best.  Very friendly and professional.  He made our lunch throughly enjoyable.  Will most certainly be a repeat visitor"}
{"text":"Il Fornello has been a long standing favourite for my family and I. We were there last night and were completely overwhelmed by the outstanding service. Thank you to Kim - she was charming and prompt: from the water, when we sat down to the delivery of the bill. It is remarkable that my 4 children agreed that this lady was the best server we have ever had anywhere! I say again - thank you for exceeding all expectations! Of course, the food was delicious, as always! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to Il Fornello dozens of times, since I was a kid.   All I can say is that the food is 'decent' and not terribly overpriced. I've always usually stuck to the pizza, and it's not too bad. I've been to multiple locations, and the decor is usually pretty good.   Servers are fairly attentive, and I've never had a bad experience at Il Fornello on that front. I don't recall ever having a screwed up order either.   Good if you want to have Italian without breaking the bank. If you're looking for a more upscale meal, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent meal. Nothing negative to say. Had a range of items such as the antipasto, pasta, veal.  I'd work on the antipasto dish. A bit expensive for what was in the dish.   All in all a good experience, and great service."}
{"text":"OMG.  OMG.  OMG.   Meatball appetizer.  OMG Mussels appetizer.  OMG Butternut squash ravioli.  OMG Pappardelle salsiccia.   OMG  Dreamt about it all night.  Still thinking about it.     We are going back again tonight."}
{"text":"I love their thin crust oven baked pizza! The staff is very friendly and always accommodating!  The best pizza in the neighborhood by far."}
{"text":"The food is alright and too over priced for what it is. My main complaint about this place is the service and appearance.  Let's start off with the service.. I have had a couple positive experiences where the service has been good and the food came out fairly quickly. However, the majority of my visits here have been very slow or just unsatisfactory. Some of the waiters and waitresses seem to have no idea what they're doing. There have been several times where we've had to ask multiple times for the same thing! Most recently, we asked for more bread 3 times before it was brought out! Very hit and miss with this place. They need more staff and better trained ones too..  Now moving on to the appearance. This is just my personal preference, but I just do not like how it looks inside. Really ruins the experience for me. Everything is very open. There are no booths. Tables are a bit too close to each other for my liking.  If you don't mind the poor service and like how it looks inside, I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"I was returning a favour, and I told my friend that he can pick any restaurant in the City of Toronto and I'll pay for it.  I will never, EVER allow him the privilege of making a decision for me ever again. Ever.  If somebody told me I an pick any restaurant, I'd go to that one which isn't a chained one. CHAINED restaurants are the shackles of the epicurean discernible! Damn him!  I felt like I was at a Pickle Barrel, with slightly better seating. Bayview Village man, we could have gone to Sierra..or even bought some grocery at Pusateri's. I would have really enjoyed some grocery shopping at Pusateri's. It was a civilized dinner, the venue was almost empty, and the plants looked remarkably artificial. There was basically nothing on the menu aside from pasta. Seriously, how does the Italians live? It's not like every Chinese dish is served with rice.  I got Alfredo, because I was Alfriaid to get anything else. I never know what I'm ordering in Italian restaurants. I also got a bottle of wine, that was my main course. It was the four of us, each with our respective female..well, I wouldn't call them counterparts...maybe just parts. Yeah, we were with our female parts... Oh Lord I'm bored. I would say that coming here on a Saturday or Sunday morning for brunch would be actually enjoyable..except we were here on a Friday night. You know where I am Friday nights? Not where I have brunch that's where! The venue was very neat I do have to say, and I appreciate cleanliness. If was a broke and a Woman..I'd have my bridal...luncheon here...that's what it's called right? Bridal luncheon? Or maybe meet with my book club over some cheap white wine and discuss that Jane Austin novel. But I'm a male in my early twenties whom although deeply admire the old and traditional...finds this place just a little too retirementesk.   The older waitress was lovely, I wanted to sip tea with her while discussing what her daughter looked for in a Man.  Bayview Village was the only mall I enjoyed being in, as it carried an air of affluence..somehow, maybe it's the Havana Gentleman shop..or the large vintage section at the LCBO..or maybe it's all the rich wives shopping for God knows what here on a weekly basis.  I was bored, and I felt trapped here. I was glad to see my friends, but I really prefer to see them somewhere else. This place has \"patio\" seating, but it was in a mall...WHAT'S THE DEAL?  ll ForHellNo!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in some aspects of the experience.  We were warmly welcomed, and the server was with us quickly.  The beet salad was a bit bland, the pizza crust was soggy.  Tasty, but soggy.  The homemade sausage on it was divine.  Partner had salmon which again was OK.  Wine is pricey by the glass, and unlike any other restaurant I've been to recently, they charge for pop refills.  Given that it's a 6oz glass filled with ice to start with, for 2 bucks, that put a really sour note on the evening.    All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but with so many other options in town, it will be a while before we're back."}
{"text":"Great service!  Amazing Pizza Margherita.  Dropped in after a show at Roy Thompson Hall, and could not be happier with the atmosphere, view, food and wine."}
{"text":"I really like the pizzas at this place, I never try anything else, so this review is just for pizzas, environment and service. The service is really friendly and helpful, the environment is nice and the pizzas amazing! :)"}
{"text":"No seafood sauce with calamari... Wtf...I would not have ordered if I knew that.... Blech"}
{"text":"This probably isn't the fairest of reviews of this place for I have only tried the lunch buffet. I'd rate my dining experience at around a 2.5-3 as I found the array of options pretty disappointing.   The entire selection was placed on a relatively small table where you get around 4 appetizers, 4 entrees and a couple of desserts. Obviously you can't get top notch italian meal preparation for around $18 but if you cant get quality, I was hoping might as well make it up with quantity, and that's why this place didn't really make my day. You have a plate of spaghetti, and for the next round, another plate of spaghetti? If I ever do come back, I'm hoping the alacarte menu is whole different story."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday and was very disappointed.  Went for a pasta dish and it tasted like all of the (cheap) ingredients were cooked earlier in the day and was just reheated. Tasted absolutely awful. Way overpriced for the quality. Will certainly not be returning."}
{"text":"Their $10 Pizzas in Tuesday night are a draw, however their best pizzas are not available at a discount. The patio is also a strong feature."}
{"text":"I'd actually give here a 3.5  I had been to the Danforth location of Il Fornello years ago and liked it, so expected here to be about the same, and it was, when I came for dinner around 6pm on a mild Tuesday evening in December.  The place was less than half full, with the majority of the customers seated toward the front of the restaurant.  There must be at least 30 or 40 tables with a capacity for 100 I'd say.  Simple, casual/fine dining atmosphere with low lighting.  Friendly service.  Free white bread with oil and vinegar to start always is the perfect beginning to an Italian meal for me.  Then my friend and I split an order of garlic cheese bread, which was delicious with lots of cheese melted to perfection.  We each also tried the Gnocchi Gorgonzola (house made gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce with toasted walnuts 18.65) which was delicious and very filling.  I'm not even a walnut lover, but these were the perfect touch.  Somehow yet, my friend was able to order and eat most of a side plate of fingerling fries.  She obviously had a carb addiction that night.  lol  We split some bottle of pinot grigio which I don't recall the details of, other than we did it enjoy it as well.  My only complaint of the evening may sound huge to some people, but there was a smell of sewage throughout.  This is common in many restaurants downtown, something I guess to do with the old piping in the city.  It wasn't dominant enough to really bother me, but it was there.  So if you are sensitive to that, you may want to test it out before sitting down to order.  The place itself seemed clean, so I doubt it was any fault of the restaurant.  I'd definitely go back here anytime."}
{"text":"I had the prefix lunch for 15. Not worth it at all. The salmon pasta was sour as heck. I had to return it, and they gave me a cannelloni no issues, the service seems awesome tho, maybe it's just that one bad dish.  I eat a lot of Italian food so I know they messed that one up real  good.  Someone must have pushed that cup of lemon juice into my plate, or the guy was practicing his arm strength with the lemon to see how much juice he could have extracted out in one squeeze.  Waiting for my dish now..that one sucked too haha."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  they left the doors to the patio wide open for the breeze to flow through to the bar. patio is quite spacious and fenced off from the parking lot so you get to enjoy your dining experience undisturbed. it was slightly chilly out of the sun, so we opted to sit in the bar dining area.  service was attentive, and food came out in reasonable time. the CALAMARI FRITTI was quite tender; and the SALAMI BOARD was a bit skimpy but hard to mess up.  my date and I had a MARGHERITA PIZZA to share and it was definitely over salted. for a pizza with such simple ingredients, you'd think they'd get it right?!  nothing was horrible but I don't particularly feel inclined to return either."}
{"text":"What a great evening! First off, the service was great, the food tasted perfect and drinks were heavy--- Just like I like it. A must do again. Thanks for the fun night!!!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza options. The only issue is that the price for a gluten free crust is very pricey. Everytime I have gone in the price has gone up. Currently it is around $5 extra for Gluten free crust"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last Friday night around 6:30pm. It wasn't too busy, no problem getting a table. What we ordered: Insalata Barbabietole, Linguini di Mare, Pizza Fichi  The highlight was definitely the Linguini di Mare, it was SO delicious! Sadly, the mussels were a bit too fishy for my liking, but everything else was okay. The sauce was really good so that made up for the mussels. The insalata barbabietole was pretty big, we shared it as an appetizer. Tasted really good as well. I thought the Pizza Fichi might be too sweet because of the honey and figs, but it turned out to be a really good combination!   Definitely will return and order the Linguini di Mare again!!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated with a great patio.  Food is good and the fried mozzarella balls are fantastic."}
{"text":"I recently tried Il Fornello for the first time. I was very impressed with the service and food. Upon arrival we did have to wait for a table (not surprising for a restaurant on the danforth at 7pm on a Friday!).   The first table that became available was behind the host stand and the host was kind and honest enough to tell us that we might not be comfortable there due to a draft and overhearing him speaking all night; he assured us that within a few minutes another table would be available and offered us the choice between the two. We ended up sitting in this great table at the front window.  Our server was nice and came to check up on us just enough. I was delighted by the gnochi assiago- absolutely the best meal I have had in a long time. I also had a salad to start and it was very flavourful.   Had we been seated within the main part of the restaurant I might have found the noise level overwhelming, and therefore when I return I will be sure to make a reservation and request one of the few tables that are in the secluded areas by the windows.   Although pricey, this restaurant has been my favourite italian food yet in Toronto."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I was looking the Swisschalet that used to be there before it apparently changed hands. Automatic (-*). Went for the winterlicious menu which only came with an appetizer and entree no dessert. Repeat. Negatory"}
{"text":"The pizza was actually really good. A margherita pizza with an add of hot italian sausage.. Nice.. Went to pay with my AX card and the waiter keeps asking me if it's a debit or a credit?  I said neither, it's an AX card.  But the machine he says is asking if it's a debit or a credit. Soon he's standing at my table, the manager is standing at my table and I'm feeling like I just broke out of prison and stole a hot card.    BTW this is the same card they I used to get my rental car, check into the Westin here in Toronto, buy my meals all week....according to them it was not being accepted.  I threw down 25 loonies and left, pissed.  Kind of uncomfortable the whole restaurant watching this unfold as I was near the front entrance in open space.. btw I called AX, they said the charge was approved, nothing happening on their end..Not sure what this restaurants deal was.."}
{"text":"There's a few staples that I love, otherwise, some stuff is maybe not to my personal liking.   Must try: fichi pizza!! oh, dear god!! heavenly!! On the sweet side, however, can't go wrong with figs on my pizza.  GLUTEN FREE AVAILABLE!!! YAY!! love their calamari, & have tried some of their pizza's, & some are good, some are ok, but depending on individual tastes.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food isn't that good. It's not offensively bad, but super mediocre tbh. Tried both their pasta and pizza, pizza is better. Also, the service was not there. More often than not when you look around, there are no servers. No revisit for me."}
{"text":"It's been a number of years since I last visited this restaurant, so I didn't really know what to be expecting. Had they changed their demographic? Has their menu changed? What do others think of the place now?  I came here with my mother (conversation every time pre-meal \"I'm okay with any kind of food Wincy, you decide!\"; post-meal \"That was the worst, not my taste and definitely not worth the money!\") and sisters. Their last visit was also years ago, but we were enticed by a more diverse pasta selection close to home.  We made a reservation just in case, and was promptly seated upon arrival. Looking around the restaurant was mostly full, so good thing we thought to plan ahead. The menu is now much shorter - just two facing pages to cover everything. An added print-off showed dinner specials for the night - about one or two extra options per category. We went with two pastas and two pizzas.  Backtrack a bit to service - service was slow. We were kindly seated by the hostess but nobody came by or even said hi for at least 15 minutes. It got to a point I was worried that we were forgotten and didn't have a server. And yet on the side of the restaurant where the food came out, multiple servers happily chattered away with each other. Finally we were greeted and asked what'd we like to drink, so we quickly put in our entire order at the same time.  We asked for bread too (free) - but that didn't show up for another 10 minutes. The bread was not warmed, they were not thinly sliced, there was about 6 slices...what took so long?? The bread was a variety - some whole wheat, some white...with butter, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. Nothing special...but we all had a piece since by now we've been waiting for close to half an hour. As if they heard our stomachs growling the food came out a minute or two after the bread - talk about poor timing. I'm guessing the waitress forgot our bread which resulted in this fiasco of too many plates on the table.  The pastas came out steaming hot which was nice, and the pizzas followed right after. Everything looked promising and there were no bad surprises. Everything smelled really good, and a little extra parm atop the pastas made things better. They do use a powder parm, which is disappointing, and is oddly brought over in a soup bowl that screams accident waiting to happen. Your waitress will slowly spoon and sprinkle the parm for you - I can see picky patrons getting very nervous...the garganelli special of the night was refreshing and the tarragon cream sauce was light despite being a cream sauce. The peppers and onions have enough veggie that made it feel like springtime. The penne Capri was a standard chicken penne pasta - but smelled really good thanks to the cheese inside"}
{"text":"The menu seems a bit limited compared to other Il Fornello locations, but the food is still great. I had the Penne Capri, which was light and flavourful - would definitely have it again!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I got the Penne Capri - a really light, summery pasta dish exploding with flavour - and it was absolutely divine. I'm a pasta-holic when it comes to restaurants so this is a pretty big compliment coming from me! The waiter was hilarious and good-naturedly poked fun at me when I couldn't decide. He was a riot and made it almost pleasurable to wait for our food (the place was packed, took about 25 minutes to get our food - not bad, but not great either).  The only reason I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is because my roommate got a pasta dish that was off their summerlicious menu and used spinach pasta.... A good amount of her pasta was stuck together, starchy, and totally chewy. The waiter apologized profusely for it and my roommate wasn't too upset about it as the majority of the dish was edible and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Il Fornello has a trendy atmosphere that makes you feel like you've arrived underdressed. Made me feel all trendy just being there.   We looked over the lunch features and quickly put them aside; the main menu is where it's at. After my mom and I changing our minds 100 times, she went with the Gnocchi Asiago and I selected the Cannelloni Fromaggio. The dishes arrived and they were beautiful; we couldn't wait to dig in. My cannelloni had cheese inside, cheese outside and cheese all over. The sauce could've used something; it was a plain tomato sauce. I know it had a lot of cheese going on, but to have a plain sauce, made it a little unbalanced. The gnocchi, this was clearly the star of the show. After deciding it was awesome, my mom 'allowed' me to try a few bites. Wow. Just plain wow. The asiago sauce was creamy and rich. The gnocchi were light and tasty. It didn't need anything else, but the spinach and crispy shallots were a nice touch.    The service was alright. They never refilled our coffee and barely came to check on us. We didn't need anything(except coffee), but if we had, she was nowhere to be found.   It was a delicious meal and I'd go back. There are many more items on the menu that caught my eye! I hope the staff is a little more attentive next time!"}
{"text":"Loved the Cannelloni Formaggio. It is done perfect here. You get a generous portion from the dinner menu, that I did not expect. Prices are moderate and affordable. We didn't break the bank. The servers are wonderful and it's very clean. Love the decor as well, it's very inviting from the moment you walk in. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent. The hostess and server and even the bus boy was quick and ready to go.  We were seated right away and given water and bread. Bread was fresh and soft. We ordered the summerlicious.  Food came out in good timing. Salad was light and fresh with these great red peppers that added an amazing spice and flavour. The rice balls were perfectly fried but it just wasn't me thing.  Then we got our main dishes. The veggie penne was excellent. So many vegetables with a scrumptious sauce.  And then the dessert. Light and fresh panna cotta and sorbet. The place was packed on a Friday night. We ate way too much. Our eyes were bigger then out tummies. All for $25!!!"}
{"text":"So we decided to go for another round.   The wine selection is good but expensive - if it was unique to them that's one thing but I know what I pay for it in the liquor store.  The staff is great - friendly funny interactive - but the food is terrible.  My meal was taken off because it was unedible.  How can you order Italian pasta and the food be terrible - that's on the kitchen.  I'm thinking it will be a huge jump as to us going back - even the Caesar had rotten lettuce ... quality control is everything!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and it never disappoints. We have had my daughter's communion and recently confirmation party.  The food was excellent and the service top notch. The atmosphere is classy and there are nice areas for special party's. They will change the menu to your liking."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here yesterday for her birthday. The inside decor is very contemporary, which looked awesome. We opted to sit on the patio. The patio is separated in two areas (by a warm fireplace), one for dining and the other for lounging. Our server was very nice. We had a pitcher of the white sangria which was really good! So refreshing and lots of fruit. We ordered the ricotta dip but it was disappointing. Didn't think it was gonna be cold. Wouldn't order it again. For dinner I had the gnocchi and added chicken. It was so delicious. Felt like I was in heaven. It is heavy so keep that in mind. For dessert we had the cheesecake to share which was ok, nothing to brag about. I would definitely go back for the food and sangria!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb shank with the smoked salmon and panna cotta desert. Everything was good, nice ambiance. Would come back here again."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at Il Fornello when they used to be located a few blocks down Queen St. It took me several years and a location move before I tried the restaurant again.   I'm happy to say that since I tried the place again I had nothing but great food and service. The quality has definitely improved and am now a regular whenever I'm super hungry!   I find the place to be a little costly but can't complain about the serving size."}
{"text":"5 star for me. My parents are traditional italians and are very hard to please when eating Italian food; but they're always happy to dine here. They love the mussels and pasta's. Also, a real wood burning oven is rare so this is why they deserve top marks."}
{"text":"Edible Italian food, but with a great location opposite Roy Thomson Hall, Toronto.   Used for location before work. Other than that, for tourists going to a show."}
{"text":"Came here for the fixed price lunch ($18) with a friend at 11:30 a.m. on a Friday. If you would like to make a reservation (which I would personally suggest as it got very busy by noon), I would recommend doing so for slightly after 11:30 a.m. (their doors didn't actually open until a few minutes after that).   APPETIZER: Roasted Red Pepper Soup  This was the soup of the day, and it was definitely a great start to the lunch! To my surprise, the soup was not blended entirely, in that there was lumps of what I believe to be roasted red peppers in the soup - but I really liked this! It made the soup a great dipping sauce for the complimentary bread that they provide!   This soup was not only tasty, but also felt light - I would come back another time for this!  MAIN: Salmon Salad  This salad, on the other hand, I probably would not come back for. While the portion size for the salad itself was large, it tasted relatively bland and the salmon was very small (approximately a bit less than 3 oz). The boiled potatoes were quite delicious (some would consider it lacking flavour, but I personally like my potatoes with less seasoning); though, the boiled egg was well seasoned. Also, for lovers of olives, this may be your dish of choice, as there is plenty of olives scattered throughout this salad (I am not a fan of olives, so this is why I know/paid particular attention to the abundance of olives in this salad).  SERVICE:   Our server, Amanda, was excellent! She was very attentive to our needs, despite it being such a busy time for the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is my frequent haunt for pre-show/pre-TSO dining. It's right there, it's overall reasonably priced, with a sufficient menu and wine list.  The food is very acceptable, and even my pickiest-eater friends have to make decisions on what they would like to eat. Plus, there's lots of new and interesting stuff for this guy to choose from too! No, it's not super-authentic Italian, but it is good and it's a great departure from pub grub.  I highly recommend anyone thinking about dining here call ahead for reservations. When they get busy, they're slammed. Otherwise, the place is decently quiet. On a busy night you can expect dinner to take a bit longer, too.  The main draw is the wood-burning pizza oven. It gives the whole place a nice warmth, especially if you're sitting in the area immediately surrounding it. It also results in especially tasty pizza (even if just pep & cheese).  If you're looking for a place that's easy on the brain, easy on the tummy and willing to pay for the setting and location (the main dining room is very cozy), this is your place!"}
{"text":"I'm out of practice.   I haven't gone out for dinner on this overrated, fake holiday (aka Valentine's day) for too many years. I was displeased to be greeted by the 20 people line up prior to seeing any staff member of Il Fornello.   Luckily, the staff tended to the line before we could complain. We were seated in no time.   But our intimate Vday spectacle was far from private. We sat at a table in between two other couples in close proximity. Missing the NBA All-Star 3 pointer shoot out broadcasted in the bar wasn't my only distraction. I could clearly hear the conversations beside us. Fine, I was eavesdropping, but I could hear every word clearly.   It was a little difficult to concentrate on our meal, but the food was commendable and aligns in price. Portions are adequate in size. I highly recommend the wild mushroom risotto with chicken breast. And our waitress was exceptional.  We skipped dessert. Didn't want to miss the rest of the NBA All-Star festivities or hear any more bland conversation not belonging to to us."}
{"text":"I constantly hear that there are innumerable great Italian places to eat in the city so I thought I'd start running through the list! I came to Il Fornello with two friends on a weekday evening for dinner. I ordered the margherita pizza which was about $14 pre-tax/tips. I thought the service was just fine, the ambiance was fun and the pizza itself was alright, though it didn't taste like it was made fresh. I will have to trek over to Terroni and other places to compare but for the time being I think Scaddabush's margherita pizza (also priced at about $14) was preferable."}
{"text":"I always believed that saying: \"Pizza is like sex, even when its bad, its still good\".  FALSE.   I ordered the Pizza Pollo here...and it was hands down the worst pizza I've ever had.  And I LOVE pizza. The roasted red peppers were slimy, but that could be overlooked.  The real tragedy here was the chicken on the pizza...it tasted as though it had been cooked, frozen, and then thawed and rewarmed.  Nasty. Sadly, I am non-confrontational, and instead of saying anything, I just didn't finish it.   I'm not sure where they got the \"best pizza in Toronto\" rating...but it certainly wasn't from me! Lets hope that all these other Yelpers can't be wrong, and I'll just chalk it up to a one-off."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent italian place - this would be a good option. I ordered a funghi pizza for $17.45. The portions are good and the service was decent.  The funghi pizza had cheese, spinach, and various mushrooms. The waiter also added extra cheese on top which is a must.  I enjoyed how light tasting the pizza was and it wasn't too salty given the amount of cheese on it."}
{"text":"my review is only for the sunday brunch buffet.  There is a good selection of cold apps to start (salad, cold pastas, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, artichokes, etc).  There were 4 different thin crust pizzas to choose from - veggie, Hawaiian, cheese, pepperoni.  There were scrambled eggs (meh), bacon, salmon, mussels, veggies, 2 types of pasta (both sauces were GREATTT and I wanted more but I had no room haha), chicken (dry),  eggs Benedict (looked gross and dry). There's also a bigg fruit platter that i really liked as well.  Hilights - butternut squash soup was SO buttery,creamy, so sweet, LOVEDD it.  I would come back just to have the soup.  They also had some sort of eggplant dip and I used it on my pizza crust, also AMAZING. It's pretty salty though and left me thirsty but I don't even care.  I came here once before for the buffet and the french toast was really REALLY good, but this time it disappointed so i guess its hit or miss.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Regular customers and love the food and service. We tried something different and ordered delivery through uber eats. An extravagant treat while our kids were away. The app placed our order twice. I called the restaurant to help and was told they don't have anything to do with the online and it was very busy so she couldn't help me. I call uber eats to help and they said cancelled one of the orders. Next thing I know I have an uber driver calling me saying he is trying to pick up my order but I canceled it. Back to the restaurant who say an uber driver was there and took our order. Back to uber eats who say they have no idea where our food is but would I like to order from another restaurant closer to my location. Since we live less than five minutes from the restaurant we declined and were rather shocked about their commitment to one of their clients. We called Il Fornello and spoke to Dan who was very apologetic. We wanted him to know that we didn't get our food and uber eats was less than helpful and suggested we go to another restaurant. What did we learn?  We would have been better off making our own dinner and I am left with the thought of some guy eating my husband's veal marsala in the Canadian Tire parking. I can't even cancel my account on the app. I have to email them to \"request\" it."}
{"text":"Best pasta I've ever had in Toronto!  I got the Rigatoni Funghi e Carne and it was absolutely delicious!! The creamy sauce was super tasty, the pasta was cooked to perfection and it had a lot of mushrooms that matched the sauce. The meat part wasn't my favourite but it wasn't bad at all. The portion was pretty big.  Service was really nice! I have no complaints."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been here four times and have loved it every time. The fresh bread is incredible, and their $10 weeknight pizza deal is great! The pizza is delicious and has never disappointed. The customer service is top notch and the atmosphere is rustic and modern. We will definitely be returning! :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in with a large group on a Saturday night. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. This is the only location I've been to. The restaurant is large, clean, bright and well decorated.   The group shared different pizza's. The quality and variance of the toppings were excellent.  Overall I was very happy with the experience of the evening."}
{"text":"Tried it today for lunch. Although they have the prix fix lunch specials I tried off the menu. Got a pizza salmone and a calimari. Both were fantastic. The calimari was huge and even had some shrimp in it served with tartar sauce. The salmon pizza was delicious with some lemon on top. First time trying salmon on pizza and was not disappointed. Service was good. Prices are not cheap that's for sure. If come back for the prix fix lunch specials for like 20$ I think that's more worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here before watching Kinky Boots. Waitress came by frequently to refill out water as we talked away throughout our meal.  I ordered the Atlantic salmon that came with crispy potatoes, herbs, lemon juice, and some spinach. Overall the salmon was nicely seared and cooked and tasty. However, they did add too much rock salt to the point that I could feel myself munching on large rocks.   In terms of the environment, it was a little bit upscale and you can tell by how others were dressed. Not sure if it's because Spring is just coming, but it got more warm throughout our meal. Then they dimmed the lights twice, which made it harder for us to see each other and take pictures of our food.  We came here mainly because it was close by, can't say I was overly impressed, but the food was good. Just don't wear a sweater or you'll be burning up in there."}
{"text":"Three of us came in on a busy Monday night and they seated us immediately. The food was excellent! Bread with balsamic and olive oil was brought to the table. I ordered the Truffled Malfada Funghi. It was very rich and filling and absolutely on point! Portion was perfect. Service was great even when the restaurant was full. I am definitely come back again for this dish!"}
{"text":"Just fine, but a bit pricy for what you get.  Most of the Il Fornello crowd has moved to the Green Eggplant, for good reason.  They do have gluten-friendly food."}
{"text":"The pizza is not my favourite because it gets soggy in the middle, but the pasta is good! The gnocchi is creamy and fluffy and carries the flavour of the gorgonzola so well, the walnuts are a really nice touch! :D"}
{"text":"Service and food are amazing . The best pizza in Oakville ! Kid friendly environment. I really recommend ."}
{"text":"These guys did a great gob with GF pizza when I recently dined with a group of 14 people. The fact that I was able to customize a pizza specifically to what I wanted was really appreciated, especially when they were managing a large group.   Everyone seemed pleased with their food, and the service was very efficicent. The ambiance is defintely noisy here, but that's pretty common in the downtown core, especially when you have a large group."}
{"text":"Il Fornello is a favourite of my friend's family, so when we decided to head into the city for a saturday night supper, this was an obvious pick. I've never been before, but heard they offer some gluten-free options, so I was excited to give that a go.   It's definitely a popular place; not packed, but busy for the time (7PM, Saturday). The highs are that service is attentive and quick, the lows are that several families with small (read: loud) children were in the vicinity. Not the end of the world, but it does make it more difficult to talk to people close to you!   The variety of salads on the menu are outstanding; In fact, I'd be tempted to order just salad the next time I visit, or insist someone share one with me. We shared three among a table of 8, and all were well dressed with great toppings.   My main was a specialty pizza with gluten free crust, which was pleasant. My one complaint is the temperature of the pizza when it arrived at the table. GF crust is hard to do well, and to be done the best it needs to be hot hot hot when served. I got a lukewarm pizza, but all things considered it was still okay.   I'd give this place another go, but I'd be tempted to come on a lazy weeknight or Sunday afternoon just to avoid the Saturday night din."}
{"text":"I'm confused how a small container of bland fettuccini Alfredo with cold bread and butter can cost me $19 after taxes. Does Il Fornelo realize that there are 100 Italian places in the city? My particular beef is the location on the Danforth. Please do something about this. Next time I go Scaddabush"}
{"text":"After glow-in-the-dark mini golf, my friend and I came here for a light dinner. The restaurant's exterior looked nice, a tad posh, so we thought it might cost an arm and a leg. But to our surprise, despite its nice exterior and it's even nicer interior -soft, neutural colours with modern comfortable furniture and a lit candle at every table, the prices were not so bad, moderate for this type of restaurant.   Because neither of us were that hungry -we had dim sum for lunch, we decided to split a pizza of my choice. Being an awesome friend, he didn't bitch about my veganism and said he'll eat whatever I order. So I ordered the QUATTRO STAGIONI, minus the cheese and minus the meat, with more of the vegetables instead and on whole wheat. The pizza was amazing. Light crusted with a section of articoke hearts (my fave), olives and mushrooms. I wasn't crazy about the olives, they were the kalamata sort and I only like the conventional black olives.  Il Fornello is not very vegan friendly, but hey, I'm a survivor. The whole point in me sharing reviews here on Yelp is to show other vegans/ vegetarians that they too can dine with their meat eating friends in meat serving establishement. Not eating meat should not keep me from hanging out with my friends. So to all you veggie haters... SHUT UP and continue to clog your arteries with animal fat and dead carcasses!  Focus on what you're consuming, NOT what I'm eating. If I go to a meat mainly establishment with you and I'm NOT bitching and complaining about how everything's meat and cheese, then you better not be bitching and complaining about me. CAPICHE??????  I know what I want, what I want to spend my money on and what I want to feed by body. \"My Benjamins, my Benjamins!\" You have no say.  Your Veggie Queen has spoken. Word."}
{"text":"I went last year during Summerlicious, and everything was bland and boring. It was so bad that it was actually comical; I couldn't help but laugh at how terrible one thing after another was."}
{"text":"It's the first time I went to Il Fornello after I have sworn off wheat and looking for gluten free foods.  I'm impressed that a main stream restaurant can provide the options. You can get gluten free pasta (rice pasta - $2), a yeast free spelt crust ($2) or a gluten free crust ($5) for pizza.   And the server was really good about substitutions and asking the kitchen and reporting back to me.  One of the few people that put two and two together and told me that I can have sorbet for dessert.   My only qualm is that it was quite pricey.  For my smoked salmon pasta , that was really an appetizer portion to me was $17.  They did have a good $22 two course deal. Salad/Soup/Pizza + Risotto/Pasta/Main. I don't remember it was this expensive when I used to frequent here with my UCC friends in high school!  As for the atmosphere, the place is small and low ceilings.  I don't know something about it I don't like. Seemed a little sterile.   But the service was great.  She was attentive, and informed us when out meal got a little late, and gave us my sorbet on the house because she was chatting up the guy next to us and got distracted.    Pricey tho!"}
{"text":"The Arugula & Beets Salad had arugula, beets, chèvre, and balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a lovely salad with lots of big chunks of goat's milk cheese and fresh beets and arugula.  I enjoyed the spicy tomato broth of the Mussels.  I found the spiciness in the tomato broth just right and it was tasty.  Their Pizza Fichi made with mascarpone, proscuitto, figs, grano padano, honey, and arugula was the pizza that everyone fell in love with last time at the tasting and this time we ordered it again to share.  We split this one too (no photo unfortunately) and I found that this time, the proscuitto was more cooked and crispy than the one I had last time.  In my piece, I didn't get any figs and couldn't taste the creamy mascarpone or honey that I loved last time.  We shared the Pizza Salmone.  This had smoked salmon, mozzarella, panna di cucina (mascarpone cream), arugula, and lemon.  I loved how big the slices of smoked salmon were on this pizza.    Their Pizza Fichi was made with mascarpone, proscuitto, figs, grano padano, honey, and arugula.  We split this one too and I found that this time, the proscuitto was more cooked and crispy than the one I had last time.  In my piece, I didn't get any figs and couldn't taste the creamy mascarpone or honey that I loved last time.  For my entrée, I ordered the Atlantic Salmon.  This was a pan seared Atlantic Salmon with lemon caper aioli, fingerling potatoes, and vegetables.  The salmon was very nicely pan seared so that the skin was very crispy.  The salmon was quite tender and moist too.  I especially loved the carrots and green peas.    We shared the Tiramisu.  This was a really good portion of excellent Italian dessert that wasn't too sweet.  It was soft and fluffy too!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time at 7pm on Saturday. Service was fast and unobtrusive which to me is one of the main qualities that separates the Pros from the Joes.  I had Pollo con Asiago. I enjoyed it but don't recall the chicken being \"stuffed\" with spinach and asiago cheese, I don't eat the skin so after it was peeled away it tasted like plain chicken. The \"sauce\" was cooked/dried onto the skin and there was none on the plate, I could not taste any garlic flavor in the mashed potatoes which were good (correct consistency) otherwise. The mushrooms, broccoli and roasted carrots were excellent but I usually like to know which ones I am getting. Maybe you are supposed to ask. To me a good server tells you as the menu only indicated vegetables. Two others had Insalata Roma (salad) which was much too large for accompaniment with most of it going to waste. Seems like it would be a good base to add chicken, shrimp or salmon to though. My meal was unevenly heated and just warm, one of the meals was not warm almost cold which they promptly reheated. Bruschetta seemed to be good with lots of tomatoes. Another diner's pizza seemed small/thin but well topped and tasty. The interior ambiance was good, loud enough for privacy but not too loud that you can't converse. We were sitting in the raised center section against a half wall which seem to be ideal until a self absorbed person maybe trying to find something they dropped after their party had left, got up from their chair and proceed to place their backside into my lap/chest area making contact without even realizing it or were not socially developed enough to apologize. Continuing on they left the chair blocking the aisle. I pushed the chair back so that a server with full hands could pass. In my opinion the table across from us was far too close for safety and comfort. The location is in a strip mall your view is the parking lot which from inside which is okay by me as I like to keep an eye on my vehicle but I can't imagine it being very appealing from the outdoor patio. Although I enjoyed it especially since I was treated I would give it an okay/good, not great with my cost to value perception being poor/okay. Oakville is a wealthy town so it may not be something many patrons are concerned about."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's dinner last year. Bf ordered marguarita pizza, it was mediocre at best. I had some sorta pasta dish (can't remember as this was last year) and that was only ok. We sat upstairs where I was sitting on a cushioned bench but my bf sat on the most uncomfortable chair ever! I know because I tried it after he complained about it.  Food was also pricey. Service was below average."}
{"text":"Made a reservation (recommended) for our group of 6 before going to a show down the street.  Waiter was fast and attentive and kept our glasses of wine and water full consistently.  The waiter knew the menu well and was quick to answer questions and make small changes to suit people's tastes.  Appetizers and entrees came hot and quickly.  Everyone was quite happy with their food and the service."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS gnocchi pomodoro (although the serving size was a bit small). Our server was not very attentive, even though there were about four tables to serve. Considered dessert, but after receiving, eating, and waiting another 10 minutes without checking in on our meal, my table decided against it.   Three stars - satisfactory gnocchi, unsatisfactory service."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about this place (being, myself, a server) was their incredible ability to handle numerous tables with large groups. The service was professional and attentive to my group of 20. The selection of food options was amazing, with plenty of delicious choices and for a price that was not bad at all - ideal for a special night if you're still on a budget! I had the gnocchi Gorgonzola and it was great.  I also managed to learn the name of a dessert I'd forgotten the name of (Tartufo), ordered it, and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Our server that night was very friendly and prompt with filling up our water glasses.  However, he forgot to bring our wine for a few minutes until he suddenly remembered.  He also completely forgot to bring us our bread basket.... which in the end was fine because I wouldn't have needed more carbs anyway, but the fact was that he forgot entirely.  We ordered the Orrechiette Con Ragu Di Pancetta E Funghi and Pizza Fichi (which I have raved about and recommended to people since the last time I had it.  Unfortunately, neither was to my liking that night.  Firstly, the orecchiette dish was overly al dente at first taste.  Being at an Italian restaurant, I wasn't sure initially whether the al dente was just too firm and hard for my liking or whether it was slightly uncooked -- that actually didn't occur to me until a halfway into the dish because my impression of Il Fornello had been so good up to this point that I didn't think anything less of them.  However, I actually did think that the pasta in this dish was undercooked.  Not to mention that each pasta shell was very firm and did taste a tiny bit raw, but also the shells of the orecchiette stuck together several at a time.  I believe that when pasta is thoroughly cooked, it shouldn't stick together at all...    The Pizza Fichi was also a disappointment because instead of being a predominantly fig pizza, it ended up being more of a prosciutto pizza.  When I looked at the pizza, there were barely any figs on it.  Yes, there was one fig piece per slice of the pizza but that one piece was like a sliver of the actual fig fruit and nothing compared to the generous and succulent portions that I had had before.   Before we left that night, we had the Chocolate Banana Cake.  This was actually very good!  It was a lot more chocolaty than I realized. The banana and banana mousse were extra cold in between the slice of the cake and the cake was definitely garnished with chocolate ganache on the outside.  It was a heavy cake but tasted quite good and moist (which is so important for cakes).  That night, both K and I had to go to the toilet multiple times.... we think it was because of what we ate for dinner at Il Fornello.. :/"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try this place earlier this week. It was busy because of the Christmas/holiday break, so the restaurant was packed. I made my reservation online, which I find to be extremely convenient since everything is electronic now. The restaurant was very clean, everything neatly tucked in and put together nicely. I give extra points for that because cleanliness is very important to me.  Upon entering, we were greeted immediately and seated right away. The gentleman (Francesco) that served us was very well mannered and very attentive. The moment he saw us seated, he came over with bread and asked what we wanted to drink (this guy deserves a raise). We ordered the eggplant parmigiana, steak & gnocchi and linguini di mare. Let me tell you, the eggplant was superb! I've grown up hating eggplant and still don't like it. But after trying this, I may start eating eggplant! I was genuinely surprised by how it came out. It was slightly crispy on the outside and super tender on the inside, yum! The linguini was also a hit because the sauce was made just right, not overpowering. There were quite a bit of seafood in it as well. The steak in my opinion was not so great. Presentation was perfect, but when I made the first cut I realized it was not done the way I wanted. It was rare on the left side of the steak and slowly made its way to medium rare at the other end. I was quite disappointed with my meal, since it cost 39.99 (go big or go home, right?). It was also not very tender, making it hard to cut and difficult to chew. I would put my money at The Keg or a Costco steak.  Overall a great place to be with friends or significant other. Some dishes were great and the others weren't so much. It could be timing, that's why my steak wasn't prepared right. Only way to find out is to go back! 3.5 stars total, 2.5 for food and 1 for cleanliness and professionalism :)"}
{"text":"When we got seated, we waited 30minutes just to place our drink order, which didn't come until after we got our meals. The food was alright, i got their pasta, but the service was horrible!!! . We went on a Friday night which is probably why it was so busy but needless to say, restaurants like this are goin to be busy on a Friday night, so be prepared for your dinner rushes. If you do go, be prepared for rude and slow service and average food."}
{"text":"This place really dropped in quality after the latest renovation.  Gone is the warm, cozy environment of an Italian restaurant, now it just looks like a modern cafe.  The best meal on the menu, Veal Marsala, is now gone. The recommended \"chef's specialty\" item here is an eggplant covered in cheese. An incredibly underwhelming dish.   Doubt I'll be coming back here often.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Not the best Italian around, but they do have a few specials that hit the mark.  The place could use a deep clean and a reprint on the menus.  Beware of any holidays or prime time hours as the place can get overbooked."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Service was fantastic. Food was served piping hot which made me very happy. I hate getting cold food. Portions were big. Boyfriend and I shared calamari which was delicious. Sangria was good. When server was asked for the cheque, it came promptly. (Another peeve of mine is having to wait to pay).  Not only would I return, but I'd order the same pasta dish. (It came with spinach, tomatoes & mushrooms which I loved. Nice to see restaurants that have veggies!)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight with the family and we had gnocchi which very tasty but small portion, we shared a Diavolo pizza which was good but salty and also shared a Gorgonzola salad which ad no taste othe that a clump of cheese. Then for dessert we had the cheesecake with seasonal fruit...what a disappointment for $8.25 for a small piece of cake which was probably no more than over 1\" high....way over priced. Overall would not go back...disappointing as they use to be good."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian restaurants in Oakville. Very good spaghettini bolognese with braised beef.  Service was polite but the server was not very knowledgeable about the menu. When I ask about a particular dish, I don't want to be told \"I don't know I haven't tried it.\""}
{"text":"I've heard that this place was a decent place to go. One Saturday night we decided to take the plunge and hit it up. Oddly however the place was not very busy. There were a few tables here and there, but mostly empty. We were sat in the front of the restaurant at a window seat overlooking King St. First off the bat what I noticed was the mother who was letting her child run rampantly through and around the tables. I realize this was not the restaurants' fault but I highly dislike when this happens. A crying baby I can accept, but a child who is just randomly running everywhere, ducking under chairs, and knocking over things as he shoots past it needs sedated. I watched in amazement as he almost knocked over the tray of water our server was carrying to our table and then continued plowing through the aisle.  Anyway, I digress. Onto the Review.  I immediately got a vibe from the waiter that I didn't care for. I'm not trying to be rude or mean, but he was unkempt, his hair was greasy and slicked back, but not enough to keep it from sticking out every possible angle and his attitude just screamed that he was supposed to be cut hours ago but here he is waiting tables. He very unenthusiastically answered our questions about the meals and specials being offered and then he vanished for another 15 minutes while we decided.  Eventually he did make it back to take our order. Fiancee got the Fettuccine Alfredo, and I got the Fig Pizza due to the uniqueness of that idea.  With it being fairly slow I suppose I have the ability to gripe about waiting another 25 minutes for the actual food to be delivered, again rather unenthusiastically. I was presented with a Pizza, however upon trying to eat it, I realized that this was not a pizza, this was a disc of bread with toppings on it.  Basically what I am saying is, it wasn't actually cut. Much to my surprise when I brought this fact to the attention of the server, his response to me was \"That's how we do it here, we don't cut the pizzas\"...Now, I am Italian.  I have eaten more pizza and pasta than I can possibly hope to fathom. Never once was it not cut. Even mini pizzas at restaurants, they did a one over and cut it in half.  However, I will go you one further. When I asked him if he could have the cooks cut it, he said \"They won't cut it it's supposed to be served that way\".....Well suffice to say I should have eaten the damn thing like a taco and gotten it over with, however I was forced to awkwardly use a butter knife and fork to cut through it piece by piece.  This may sound like a childlike and pointless rant to you, but it's the principle of the thing to me. Even if it was not meant to be cut, if a customer asks for something to be done, then it should be at least attempted.   With that completely behind me. The pizza was actually very tasty. I've never had Figs and Honey on a pizza before and was quite happy that I took the gamble on it.  Fiancee enjoyed her Pasta, and we went a few blocks down and had crepes for dessert. Someone feel free to shoot me a line if your pizza was indeed cut for you...."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but how can you not love Il Fornello on the Danforth?  It's consistent, it's menu changes seasonally and the food is well priced and delicious. They also offer a brunch menu on the weekends at this location.   Now I love Italian-style food with a capital L. That includes your basic noodles and sauce if I'm really in a jam, but some of the menu offerings at Il Fornello are so creative and they make sure with most pasta options to include a hit of protein (whether that be via legumes, dairy or meat) so that you're not filling up on carbs and then falling asleep at your table. They prepare well balanced meals at good prices, what more can you ask for?  They also have pizzas cooked in a stone-fired oven and a great bar menu. The servers are sometimes a bit like Mike Myers in the Sprockets skits, but what they may only sometimes lack in service they make up for in deliciousness.   This is another place where everything is fresh and made to order. A lot of restaurants won't make anything to order or deviate from their menu in any way- even if you have allergies or religious reasons for needing the alteration (YOU HEARD ME, TERRONI!).   And like all good establishments, they keep whatever you're drinking flowing, provide lots of fresh water to drink and don't pressure you into feature items, appetizers or the like. They just let you do your thang.   It's also beautiful inside and out, with a lovely patio for the warmer months and they hold their own version of Summer and Winterlicious, offering a three or four course prix-fixe menu.   Definitely worth a visit (though I wouldn't recommend other locations as highly)."}
{"text":"my wife and I had ticket to Rock OF Ages, just a few doors sown from this place so we decided to go, considering it was wood burning oven pizza. When we check in the hostess told us it would be 25 minutes to get our table, we were about to  leave when I decided to stay because there were not to many restaurants around and the show started in 50 minutes. When we stayed it ended up being 10 minutes to get seated. They sat us right in front of the kitchen, we ordered a salad and two pizza's, the salad came out after a few minutes and was ok, nothing spectacular. The pizza's were almost served immediately, frusterating to say the least, trying to rush us out of there or least it seems, therefore I could not enjoy and pace myself. the pizza's were brought out and were ok, as well. The waitress was not really pleasant and the bill was 50$ plus tip, not great food, would not go back, felt rushed and squished in the place, too crowded. would not go back even if you paid me...."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Il Fornello because I heard that it used to be good, but as I was disappointed when I went to the location in Richmond Hill, I hoped that the location downtown would be better since... well... its downtown!   Sadly I was just as disappointed. Service was fast but I wont necessarily call them the nicest people. Maybe its because we went on a Saturday night, but the staff seem flustered and no one really had a smile on their face.   Bread - was ok. nothing special. typical baguette bread. came with butter and you can dip it into olive oil/balsamic vinegar  Spinach Cannelloni - this was really disappointing. The description made it sound amazing, as it promised mushroom and spinach ricotta stuffed cannelloni topped with cheese and tomato sauce. The overall dish to me lacked flavour. It wasnt exceptionally heavy but I was basically just eating ricotta and a soggy cannelloni. The spinach was all to one side for some reason and perhaps in total I had 2 mushrooms for the whole dish. Needless so say, the dish didnt wow anyone, nor was it worth it.   Prosciutto pizza - this pizza was the highlight. The crust of the pizza was decent and the ham with arugula and cheese can never go wrong. A safe choice and made decently well.   Other than that, my friends said the pasta was ok only. With so many options around in that area, I probably wont be back any time soon."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this restaurant for around a year or so, but never getting around to it, we finally ordered from Il Fornello and we were disappointed. This place is pretty bland for Italian food. We ordered the marinated olives and the bruschetta as starters and these were fine, but it would be pretty hard to mess them up even if you're not a chef.  For mains we ordered the gnocchi with asiago cream sauce, spinach and crispy shallots. This dish was swimming in sauce, and I'm a person who usually likes a bit of extra sauce on the side, but this was overboard. The shallots were not crispy. The taste of the dish was overall bland. No other way of putting it and I'm not sure if they're under-seasoning their dishes, but it sure tastes like it. Presentation of this dish was also poor. The \"crispy shallots\" looked like worms sitting on our gnocchi and made it unappetizing. Our other main was the pizza funghi, which looked great, but once again tasted bland. At first I thought the pizza was greasy, but after a few bites I realised the pizza was actually soggy from the undercooked mushrooms. Absolutely awful and tasted like wet cardboard. The ricotta was also NOT lemon and herb whipped like they claim on their menu, something I was highly looking forward to. It was just a scoop of unseasoned ricotta placed in the centre of the pizza.   Overall 2/5. Poor presentation and bland. I'm full, but this meal was so underwhelming I feel like I could go for another full course meal just to feel satisfied.   Will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late dinner, were treated right away, our server was great, very friendly, accommodating and professional. Even though it was late at night. Our food was great, my gluten free allergy was well accommodated. Although some of the staff were chatting very loudly and making unprofessional comments at one another not acknowledging the clientele, who were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner. Otherwise I could have easily rated this place a 5 star. Young people not understanding the importance of staying professional especially while in their work place! Comments such as I'm too white, I can't eat so much spice (as the chef was preparing their dinners I guess) and another young girl shouting yes I'm so mad at you, storming out) conversations which could have been made in private or a much lower tone/ volume. The restaurant is small and open concept and created for a very awkward end to a nice dinner. Otherwise, the food was very god as I mentioned and our server did a great job."}
{"text":"Ambiance reminds me of New York City.  Tables closer together, views of King Street right downtown.  A great atmosphere.   Food was hot, well seasoned and absolutely delicious.  I had stuffed chicken, which was possibly the tastiest chicken I have ever had at a restaurant.  Carrots were delicious and mashed potatoes creamy. Service was exceptional. Always make a reservation, as this location is jam packed any time after 5:30. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent food, priced reasonably surrounded by overpriced joints. Decent decor and solid service. Nothing about this restaurant will blow you away, but it's also not likely to disappoint. I recommend the pizzas and salad appetizers. What I love about their pizzas is the vast selection of toppings and choices in crusts, and they are a baked in a wood oven."}
{"text":"Just 5 stars alone --- for its FIG pizza!!~  my fave thin crust (white bread and not multigrain, because it makes all the difference) with the toppings of sweet figs and arugula, prosciutto, and cheesy things = YuMMY yummy yummy!!  I just go back for the pizza ~~~  i've had pastas and appetizers. and Whatevers...   So this review is only a ONE-DISH rave--- the one and only fig pizza and I cannot say anymore.   I really only go to the restaurant when I crave for the pizza..  I can say i had the regular bruschetta and the salmon bruschetta, calimari, the pomodoro pasta, and some other meaty pastas, but my ratings for those would be just a regular 2 -3 stars... (nothing spectacular!)"}
{"text":"I had a long and tiring day today, but I'll try to be as objective as I can be.  This place pretends to be high class when they're not. People are dressed up as if they're going to a Zagat reviewed resto ... the napkins are made out of paper for crying out loud. If Il Fornello's had to identify with a high school subculture, they would be known as the 'Posers.'   Overly priced for mediocre food is all that I can say. I ordered the lasagna for dinner ($16). The portion was small and I'm sure that I've eaten the same thing at the Old Spaghetti Factory for 1/15 of the price. The tartufo was probably bought in bulk from Costco ... the entire package probably cost the same amount as they were charging for one.  The only nice thing was the service. 'Fiona' was very pleasant and super efficient. She would come around to our table often to refill our glasses with water.  I can go on and live a happy and prosperous life without going to Il Fornello's ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Il Fornello locations and they always have a good atmosphere to catch up with friends. My friends and I decided to try their pizzas this visit and they did not disappoint.   The prosciutto, mascarpone and figs on the Pizza Fichi was sweet, savoury and delicious. The crust was not thick and was easy to eat and fold. If you prefer a knife and fork it was just as tasty to eat that way for my friends.   The pizza ingredients are fresh and the prosciutto arugala pizza looked just as good as it tasted too according to my friend. You can enjoy a good lunch or dinner here with friends or family. It can be noisy at times but a busy restaurant is a good restaurant. Service was good and they came to check if you needed anything once in a while."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 15 people for my birthday. Both our waitresses were very friendly but it took almost 30 mins to come see if we were ready to take our orders. We had to wait about 45 mins to actually receive our food. I understand that we had a large group but it was a tad bit excessive.   The food, however, was really good! I got something off the summer fixed menu which included an appetizer, main, and dessert for $28. I got a cabrese salad, pasta alla norma (not sure of spelling), and tiramisu, all of which were amazing! Everyone else at my table really enjoyed their food as well. I highly recommend the white sangria--it is to die for!  Even though things were slow in the beginning, the waitresses were extremely kind and helpful so it definitely made up for the slow beginning.  I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"This is the first Il Fornello uptown. I associate Il Fornello with the hipster downtown crowd, so it's a little odd that they would open one up in the middle of suburbia! Anyhoo, they did, but at least it's off Yonge street, so that's a positive.   I went here for lunch one weekday. I have never eaten at any Il Fornello, so I didn't have any expectations, only that it is a well known place.  Well to my surprise they actually have a lunch buffet here! It's just a small one, with a selection of freshly prepared items like pasta, pizza, breads. It's actually pretty good and filling, though there isn't too much as far as buffets are concerned.    For the price and the selection of different foods you get to try, it might be worth to give the buffet option a go."}
{"text":"The food did not blow me away but the dessert (tartufo) was good.  A little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Consistently great food, I have never had a bad meal here and the service is always excellent. My favourite Carbonara!!"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy coming to Il Fornelo, especially on discount Tues nights. But my last couple of visits here have been a real disappointment. The price keeps going up but the food and service quality is absolutely plummeting.  The complimentary bread was extremely hard and stale.   The rigatoni funghi was tasteless and the pasta was way undercooked to the point where it was very chewy and hard.   The gnocchi with rose sauce was absolutely horrendous! Instead of mixing potatoes with regular flour, perhaps they used drywall compound. Yes, it was that bad! Even the rose sauce tasted funny. One of the worst gnocchi I've ever had, and I've ordered it at least 2-3 times here before and I remember it being quite good.   Finally the pizza! How can you mess up the pizza??? After waiting so long for it, I'd expect the crust to be at least somewhat crispy. No, it was totally mushy.   The only good thing was the beer, and it was only good because they didn't make it.  The service here has also gotten much worse. Our waitress was extremely grumpy and seemed agitated when I asked a few questions about the different pastas. When the pizza came, I asked her to bring me an extra plate for sharing and off she went and I never saw her again. Had to ask a much more pleasant waiter for the plate, which he promptly brought.   Not sure if the management changed or if all the original chefs/cooks/servers left, but this place certainly changed for the worse. What a shame, was a great place before... Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Tuesday pizza for $12!   Great deal for good food and great service!   This is actually a good spot for business meetings too since it is quite quiet and private.  Service is great as well.   Obviously we had pizza since we came on Tuesday but we have been here many other times and ordered pasta etc and it was great.  The ambiance is very comfortable and the service here is top notch."}
{"text":"I don't really get it but after having entertained some business clients here a few times I really was disappointed on each occasion. It seems that they have almost given up in trying to be a real destination place and are just coasting along offering an indifference to their guests  The olive oil they serve is also cheap as it has a kind of medicinal smell to it which denotes lousy olive oil.  Milestones offers a excellent service experience that these folks can learn from but then they don't do pizza  It is really all about the pizza (hence the name associated with an oven) and not having a real wood fired oven or pretending to have one isn't right. I will give them credit for offering a gluten free pizza before anyone else   I find it hard to recommend them as they seem to take their customers for granted and really if I drop $200 on a meal for 4-5 people then I truly do expect better.  You can tell the pizza is from a gas oven as it takes 15-20 minutes to cook as opposed to 2 minutes if its truly a wood fired Neapolitan oven.  I am disappointed that somewhere along the way the owners just gave up and figure they can just milk the customers for whatever they are worth."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the place and it was actually pretty good. When I went it was around 3 on a Wednesday and it wasn't very busy. I ordered the (pizza) and my girlfriend ordered the (pizza) and we split the bruschetta. The bruschetta was pretty good but they packed it with too much tomato which overpowered the general taste. The pizza had perfect flavour and was the perfect balance between crunchy and soft. We ordered the Zeppole for dessert which takes longer than the other menu items but it's worth the wait. The service and wait staff was 10/10 and worth an extra star. They are very attentive and friendly. I would come back if I was in the area an craving Italian."}
{"text":"Let mstart off by saying that this review would have scored much higher if the place didn't stink like a barnyard.    I brought some visiting family members to Il Fornello for dinner on their last night in the city.  They were craving pasta and we happened to be walking by Il Fornello, so...  We stepped into the restaurant and the first thing we noticed was the almost overwhelming stench...it literally smelled like a cattle stall.  We commented on the smell and the hostess explained that we were in an old building and they've kept the original wood flooring, and the flooring was responsible for the smell.  We debated leaving because of the smell, but decided to stay regardless.   We ordered chicken parmesan (huge portion), spaghetti with bolognese (sauce was delicious) and a vegetable penne dish (quite tasty).  All the meals tasted great and the portion sizes were more than ample.  However, I was somewhat envious after having received my meal, as a server walked by with one of their wood oven fired pizzas!  Should have had that instead.   Along with our meal, we had ordered some cocktails and beer.  The prices for the drinks were advertised on the menu card they handed us at $5/each, which is why we ordered them - more on that later.  The service was great, however, our table was next to the servers' station, so we had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to the staff complain about their jobs to one another as well as discuss which other establishments were hiring and where they had dropped off their resumes...while I understand that not everybody likes their job, it's probably a good idea to edit your conversation if you happen to be standing RIGHT NEXT TO A CLIENT'S TABLE. Just sayin'.  When we received our bills, we noticed that the $5 drinks were actually $7 and $8 dollars instead of the price listed on the menu card.  When we asked about that, the server indicated that the $5 drink promotion was only valid if you ordered off that particular menu card.   So, one star for food, one star for service stars lost for stench, annoying gnattering of the wait staff, and $5 drink technicality...in my opinion, that price difference should have been pointed out when we ordered the drinks, since we made a comment to our server about the $5 price when we ordered...mind you we didn't ask the specific question \"are these drinks $5?\", we were looking at that menu card, made a comment then ordered them.  At the very least, the restaurant should have given us the drinks at the $5 price...hmph!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends on a Thursday night. Didn't expect there to be so much rush but I totally forgot it was close to the theatre: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS 2-3 days in advance for dinner.   The ambiance was nice, typical high end Italian restaurant, we were a party of 10 so we needed a bigger table and it was right in the center of the restaurant so I felt a bit squished...   Service was alright, I wanted to get an opinion on which dish was richer in terms of the pasta sauce and our server looked uninterested and tried to get me to order quickly, I do understand we were a large group so she may have been trying to get orders up at out ASAP.   Not sure of the exact name of the dish I got but it was something along the lines of a pesto linguini with chicken. Honestly I wish it had a little bit more flavour as it tasted like something I could whip up at home quickly.   My bill came to around $30 with tip, entree and a soda (drinks were overpriced in my opinion).    OVERALL I didn't hate the place but wouldn't recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Coming from London for dinner with a friend, it was easy to book via the Il Fornello website. The wait staff were very attentive and the food was great. There are many selections for all sorts of diets plus gluten free pasta and pizza crust.   The restaurant was clean, as were the washrooms and was very comfortable. It has an air of a fancy dress restaurant but wasn't overly strict on a dress code which was nice since we've been walking around the city all afternoon."}
{"text":"I like the spot, and the ambience. The booths are nice and the vintage-y entrance is a gem. I've been here twice. The first time I had the truffle pasta and that was this amazing melting truffley woody meaty like goodness. By the time I came back a few months later, it was no longer on the menu, which was a huge disappointment. I had the arugula fig proscuitto \"fichi\" pizza instead. UGH, do not come here for the pizza. Dominos and Pizza Hut makes better pizza than these guys. The crust was soggy, the pizza was made up of mostly arugula, you couldnt really taste the figs, lemon or the proscuitto. It was edible but bland.  If you want great tasting pizza, go to Terronis, which is always solid or Pizza Libretto.  The service was a hit and miss but generally passable.  The Mohawk dark ale was really really good, a light refreshing brew. Amazing..   Bring back the truffle pasta!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I wanted the menu selection of the Queen Street Il Fornello, and that has recently closed, so we tried out the Danforth location. The choices are significantly greater. Kelly had a lovely Margherita pizza with fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella. She saved some to take home to her boyfriend because it was so tasty. The waitress could not tell me if the sea bass was from a sustainable source. I opted to have it as I felt that if there is demand, awareness will continue and we will harvest the fish responsibly. I hope this is not naiive. The fish was cooked to perfection but the cut was meagre. The escarole assemblage was delightful and old school, like Nana used to make. The place had a noisy end-of-the-week vibe, with lots of multi-generation groups. Eating from marble topped tables with the intimacy of incandescent filament bulbs and a generous number of atypical booth seating enhanced our experience. I had a glass of the Malbec which was an enjoyable accompaniment to the fish."}
{"text":"Good place for constantly good Italian food.  Service is good too. Wood oven pizza and lasagna are my favourite's.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is good Italian Food from a chain restaurant.   The service is normally very good and wait staff are attentive.  Their pizzas are wood oven baked and delicious.  One of my favourite dishes is the lasagna.   Quite a large portion.  If you like to add some heat, ask for the chili oil."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food here.  The Fettucini Alfredo was nothing special at all.  I would even go as far as saying it was pedestrian.  After knowing what I paid for it I felt ripped off.  Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my fav spots to eat.     I was treated very well I odered spaghetti and meatball they use to give 3 really big meatballs but have changed it to 5 small ones  the pizza is good will try that next time"}
{"text":"Just tried this place on a whim, we were starved and thought why not try this. Glad we did, enjoyed some lovely seafood pasta, lots of fresh bread and creme brûlée.  Our server was very friendly and kept bringing us more fresh bread. Normally you get one basket but even when we were eating dinner he was bringing it out. THANK YOU!   The cons, it gets insanely busy and kind of tight on space in some areas. Their charcuterie board is lacking. Not enough bread and cheese (which is part of the reason we kept wanting bread haha), it was mostly just meat."}
{"text":"Went to see Come From Away tonight  (March 23, 2018) so I decided to stop here for diner. I ordered the mussels to start and that was yummy. For my main i had spaghetti with meatballs and it was ok. The pasta was good but the meatballs were a bit bland and too soft for my taste.  The server knew I was going to a show so the foods were brought out quick. Greatly appreciated.  Very friendly server and I woukd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I did not eat here.   I met up with some friends for a drink on the patio after they'd finished dinner. They have 3 young children and rave about how accommodating the staff are. Tonight's visit involved getting and paying the bill four times, knocking over a basket of bread,  and the 6-year-old deciding that she wanted to try mussels so they made one just for her! The waiter we had was awesome - always smiling and pleasant. My Stella was good and everyone had a good time.  I would definitely return for dinner and I give the place extra props for pleasing my friends and their children!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed at this Il Fornello.   Hostess: Surly and didn't let us know we could sit at the bar. Had to wait despite seeing lots of empty tables.   Waiter: Andrew D gave us lots of attitude and little of his attention.   Food: Caesar salad was okay (lacked the saltiness of anchovies). Enjoyed the Calamari. Husband loved his Fettucine Alfredo. My Linguine di Mare was meh.   Dessert: Didn't have any because Andrew D left us alone for 20 minutes. By then, I wanted to GTFO.   We asked for the bill and waited another 5 minutes for the machine.   Summary: I wouldn't come here again. I'd rather trek to the city either to another Il Fornello location or another (better) Italian place. Just because it's the suburbs doesn't mean we don't deserve good service and food."}
{"text":"When I come for lunch, I usually get the lunch buffet because their food selection is really tasty. Also, you can get as much of the pizza as you want and I love their pizza. The pizza is cooked in a brick oven and is more of a thin crust style pizza. Their salad bar is also really good and they are pretty good at keeping everything stocked up so you won't miss anything. They also have a couple selections of pasta too which is good.  When I come for dinner, I like to get a pizza appetizer and sometimes, I'll also get the calamari. The breading for this is pretty light which is a good thing. The gorgonzola pizza is very delicious and it actually has pears and walnuts on it. I like the Linguini gamberi and the parmigiana di melanzane."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is huge - and busy too - we got lucky to get seats without reservations, they were just cramming tables in every square inch they had. Service was quick and fast, the waiters were just scrambling to put out dishes so you didn't get that personal touch but overall good service.  Food was pretty good, I felt some of their pastas were a bit wierd as if they were just throwing in random ingredients for the hell of it. Il Fornello is just one of those places where you know what to expect and it'll be good food and good atmosphere but don't expect it to be somewhere that'll blow you away and have you coming back to too often."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the extended family for lunch on a Sunday. There was a lineup when we arrived before the restaurant opened but we were seated quickly. The service was excellent. Our server, who said she was a manager, was perfect: friendly, efficient, and she made great suggestions.  The food was good. I had the lunch buffet, at $14.95. I loved the pepperoni pizza and could have eaten it all day. The mussels were good, too. The two pastas, one with oil, the other with a light tomato sauce, were good, if a little heavy. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. The omelette, at $10, looked to be tasty and seemed a good deal.  The restaurant is small and a little challenging to move around in without bumping a neighbour. The buffet is flush up against where the food comes out of the kitchen, so buffet goers have to negotiate some tight turns with the wait staff. The pizzas took a while to come out but were worth the wait.  So, I like this place. It's short of being five stars only because the food could definitely hit another level. It's good but not excellent, but I would definitely go back, and I'll try some items off the menu next time."}
{"text":"For my last few hours of a weekend in Toronto, I wanted to have brunch somewhere in the Beach, but didn't really know of anywhere to go, so I just walked down the street and hunted for an inviting place.  Il Fornello seemed nice and had outdoor seating and a brunch menu, so I was sold.  Despite a ridiculous amount of bees flying around, my Eggs Florentine was good and the accompanying fries were absolutely amazing.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  I'd definitely go back, despite it being a bit pricey.  The best part was after our meal, we took a walk down to the lake shore and took in the view.  'Twas a lovely experience all around."}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant. Our server Allen was extremely helpful and informative. The patio is not one that I am a fan of however so we dined inside. We had their pizza with hot Italian sausage and buffalo mozzarella which I'm obsessed with.  The pizza was excellent nice crispy thin crust ingredients were fresh and delectable. For mains I had the tenderloin which was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. I am an extremely picky steak eater and I haven't been to too many places with good quality meat or know how to cook it properly but this place nailed it and I know it wasn't just my lucky day because my boyfriend also got the tenderloin  after he wasn't too impressed with their chicken parm. It was a little salty and chewy. Both our steak were perfectly cooked and their mash and veggies were scrumptious We also had their penne Capri which was gorgeous; fresh veggies and flavorful chicken.  A while back we also had their smoked salmon for appetizers but they took it off for some reason but that was really good as well.  For dessert I had their tiramisu.... Honestly I've had better but it was pretty ok.  All in all definitely a really good restaurant that is consistent with the quality of food."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so badly since they offer gluten free pizza and I've heard from people who live in the danforth area (like myself) that this place is great. I searched for the gluten free crust option and to my horror the crust was an extra 5 dollars !!!! I'm sorry but that much for GF crust is just insulting. Not even pizza pizza charges that much for GF. I was at their mercy though and ultimately had to order it. When I got my pizza the gluten free crust was so underdone. It was doughy and mushy and when I picked it up all the toppings fell off. I understand GF crust can be hard to work with but I'm not a Masterchef and even I can manage. Usually GF crust can be too crispy. This was just ridiculous and for five dollars extra I expected good GF crust. I'm only giving it 2 stars because the pizza I ordered gave me an idea of how to make my own and my boyfriend said his was good but not amazing. Also it took our server like over 15 minutes to greet us."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Thursday. I went with a massive group (20+ people) and was surprised they were able to seat all of us at one table.   I thought I'd give their pizza a chance, so I ordered their prix fixe lunch special with a Pizza Margherita, which came with a mushroom soup. The soup came out within a few minutes of ordering and was pretty hot. I thought the soup was delicious. However, when the pizza had come out, I wished I ordered pasta instead. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. The pizza wasn't bad, but I can't say it was one of the best pizzas I've had at a restaurant. I can definitely find better pizza for the same price.  The service was okay. They kept filling up my glass of water, which is very much appreciated. However, when paying the bills, it took an unnecessary amount of time. I understand it was a large party, but there was only one credit/debit card machine being passed around. To pay all the bills took almost half an hour.  I would probably eventually go back and give their pasta a try, but I can't see myself going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Il Fornello is one of many nice looking restaurants on the Danforth, and we thought we'd give it a try.    Our server introduced herself and told us she was in training, which was not a big problem except for the fact that between her and her trainer, they pretty much forgot about our table.  We saw them when we placed our orders and when we received them, and that was pretty much it.  We had to flag them down to get our bill.  No check-ins, no drink refills, nothing.  The food itself was hit and miss.  The seafood chowder was delicious - flavourful and not too fishy.  The Pepperoni pizza was soggy and cold.  The Veal Limone was good, but the vegetable that came with it (rapini) was unchewable.  Based on the quality of our food and our absent servers, we decided to skip dessert.  Since there are so many other dining choices on the Danforth, I would choose one of those before going back to this Il Fornello location again."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here last week. It was a place she'd been to many years ago when she lived in Toronto and remembered it had really good pizza.   We both chose to have pizza - mushroom & spinach for me, prosciutto on whole wheat for her. I really enjoyed mine, but couldn't eat the whole thing. Had half wrapped up for lunch the next day.   Service was adequate but got the feeling our server would rather be elsewhere. He seemed annoyed when we asked questions about the menu. Good food at a decent price but not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"Had the Penne with the calamari and pizza, was delicious and had that authentic Italian taste!"}
{"text":"Ehh.    Went here because Wallpaper magazine recommended it.  But that was their Church St location when it was open I am guessing.  Went on a Sunday night and as walked in at 7:30 or so, they told us the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes because they weren't busy enough and we'd basically have to make it snappy.  We were tired from touring the city all day and so we obliged, took a table, and ordered immediately. Food obviously came very quickly and was okay.  Nothing special.    While we waited about 6 parties tried to take a table and were turned away.  As the sixth party was turned away our waitress happened to be at our table and said it was ironic so many people were suddenly coming in because the place had been dead all night long.  I would make a guess that when you don't keep regular business hours the restaurant can expect people to avoid the place.  I don't usually want to go to a place that closes at different times.  As I was walking out I looked and their posted hours didn't have a closing time, just opening, so this seems to be routine practice.  I always go to places that post their open and closing hours to be sure I can eat where and what I want when every I  have a craving for something."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for a weekend getaway and meeting a friend from here for dinner. She suggested this restaurant so we met her there. My son and I walked into this place and couldn't wait for my friend to get there so we could leave. It smelled worse than horse manure!! The smell was so vile, we were getting nauseous and couldn't stay to order or eat there!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch here with our family. We were 11 adults and 3 kids and the staff was awesome. Really appreciate the service and patience. The pizzas were great too. A perfect spot if you're planning a lunch or dinner for a larger family gathering."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week for their great wood burning pies. They also offer some of the best soy cheese for the dairy free! It is up to standard every time and the staff is always friendly and great! Reasonably priced as well. No real complaints about this classy joint!"}
{"text":"gnocchi(or lasagna) and glass of wine special for $15,  was what brought us in.  It's nice inside and all the food was of pretty high quality, my party got gnocchi ( the tomato and the cream sauce), lasanga and a ceasar salad. Everything tasted freshly made and full of flavor, Hard to describe other than what you would want it to taste like. Even the extras like Parmesan cheese and pepper are fresh.   Can't remember the red wine we had but for a wine on special it was excellent. Very full flavored and strong, I got very crunk off of the two glasses I had.  Although I usually just have homemade italian food this is not a bad place at all to go, I like seven numbers a little better but this place certainly holds up."}
{"text":"This is the first time here. The place seems nice and we had a table for 6. The waitress took little longer to take our order. We had to fetch her for service. The food was pretty good. Overall it is not a restaurant I would specially want to come again. But I wouldn't mind if I go again with a friend."}
{"text":"Ordered the $17 prix fix lunch and it was good.   I like the bread to start but surprised it's served with butter packets..   Butternut Squash Soup - nice and hot, yellow squash soup with drizzle of olive oil and pumpkin seeds for added texture  Spaghetti Puttanesca - great al dente pasta in tomato, slightly spicy sauce, with olives and capers (no anchovies!)  Also tried a bit of the mini pizza appetizer (arugula, gorgonzola(?), pear) which was pretty good. Margherita pizza was okay, could use more basil flavor. Mushroom rigatoni was a bit plain.. just large pasta with button/cremini mushrooms in what tastes like cream of mushroom soup sauce."}
{"text":"I've had friends tell me that they consider Il Fornello a bit formulaic and on the safe side, but my experience here was nothing short of positive. Our server was peasant, friendly in her demeanor and was attentive. Any menu questions were answered promptly. The bruschetta was tasty and out pasta dishes were flavorful and balanced without going over the top. Price is often a point of contention with Italian restaurants as people lament that they could make the same for less money, but I think that when the food is this quality and leaves you wanton for nothing, these complaints should take a back seat. Aside from that, the prices were very fair. Atmosphere was cozy and warm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Agree with Katie W. The last time I went, it was thanks to a gift certificate. Pasta was okay, nothing spectacular. Caesar Salad was watery and why don't they switch to whole wheat pasta? What I was really unhappy with was the bill - $60 for two people, with no booze for LUNCH. A $60 lunch?! Really? Yeah, I know that I didn't have to pay but still. For $60 you can go to a number of Danforth restaurants and get a much better deal than that - with booze!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the highlight of this dining experience was the generous serving of fruit flies that came out of of the table vinegar bottle (we may have even ate a few!).     Now normally I'm pretty understanding about this kind of thing -- I wouldn't have even mentioned it in this review -- except for the way they handled it.    The server went into instant damage control mode -- \"there's absolutely *nothing* we can do about this kind of thing\" (how about plastic wrap on the spout?!), \"these things just happen sometimes\" (um, so this has happened before?!).    We even told the manager, but got not so much as a free dessert for an incident that might have caused less hardy diners to go into hysterics and  instantly vomit (and I was with three girls - props ladies!).  Despite the bug sideshow, I gotta say, the food (pizzas and pastas) was delicious (although a tad overpriced),  the décor was nice and service otherwise attentive."}
{"text":"Just average food. We shared two pizza's, seafood pasta, and an arugula salad. Because of the location (ocean front), the price is a bit high for this type of casual food. Pizza is very thin, which I prefer. The pasta was overcooked, not al-dente.  I had a glass of organic red wine, which was not too bad surprisingly. I've never had good organic wines, but this one was a better one."}
{"text":"No issues to report. Came here multiple times for their regular menu and little did I know, winterlicious menu. If you want to come here for winterlicious no need to make reservations or wait!   Ironically, i opted for the stuffed chicken as suppose to the typical Italian food and thought it tasted just right to my liking. I was really 'stuffed' from that. I remembered their cream of broccoli was a bit watery and could've been better.   Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"I met some friends at Bayview Village for lunch, without plans to dine at anywhere specific. Il Fornello's Prix Fixe lunch menu for $18 seemed to be the most appealing choice. There was a time when they offered an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet for a similar price. I miss that.  My dining companions ordered the Butternut Squash soup (of the day), and the Arugula and Beet salad as their starters. They chose the Butternut Squash Ravioli and a pizza with Proscciutto and Arugula for their mains. I ordered the Penne Capri (grilled chicken, mushrooms, spinach, and more) pasta from their regular menu.  We all tasted each other's dishes and everything was delicious! The butternut squash soup and ravioli were very well cooked and rich in flavour. The arugula and beet salad with goat cheese had very balanced flavours in a generous serving. The pizza also had a very generous serving of prosciutto and was big enough that we had to take home half of it. The Penne Capri was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a very long time! I would definitely order it again.  If you're ever in Bayview Village and contemplating a meal, try Il Fornello."}
{"text":"I went with my friend quite early and on a freezing cold Monday, so it might explain for the lack of people in the restaurant.  However, my friend and I had a great time.  Service was great - our waitress was very friendly to us the whole time.  My friend had the special of the day: the ravioli funghi.  I had myself the linguini salmone - absolutely delicious.  Smoked salmon, peas, lemon on linguini with tarragon sauce.  The only complaint was that they placed us next to the window on a freezing cold day.  I wish they placed us further away from it, but I guess they wanted to show that people were eating at the restaurant.   Great service, great food on a cold wintery day!"}
{"text":"R Patrick One of our favorite places to dine. The food is great and so is the service inside. Patio service is slow they appear to forget where you are  this is a place you will return to often great variety of excellent dishes well presented with good wine pairing  it is great for groups and is child friendly. The best pizza in town their linguini de mer is to die for as is the tiramisu"}
{"text":"Not too bad for a lunch. Octopus appetizer was good. If you want Napoli style pizza this is not the place for you. Quick seating and service at lunch."}
{"text":"This review is for a lunch special on Saturday.    I felt like pasta, and Il Fornello had a prix fixe lunch promo.  For $17, the prix fixe lunch included an appetizer and an entree.  I ordered a Caesar salad and a smoked salmon spaghetti.  The Caesar salad was average and rich in flavour.  The spaghetti was not al dente.  It was too soft.  Taste wise, it was very tasty.  There was lot of smoked salmon pieces and asparagus pieces.  The smoked salmon tasted fresh.  The sauce was an olive oil and butter sauce with a hint of lemon.  It was light in texture and perfect for summer.  Even the spaghetti was over cooked, I enjoyed this entree a lot.  Both the salad and the pasta were of lunch size.  There is no food court in this mall, so if one does not want sandwiches and salad, Il Fornello is a good option (the other Italian restaurant in the mall serves weekend brunch, so it is not a comparable alternative).  Overall, I rate the prix fixe lunch at 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We came here on the weekend with a large group for brunch. Very friendly service and very accomodating to our group. Food was great but it took awhile for the food to come out.  I had the prosciutto eggs benny and my eggs were cooked perfectly. Also tried the breakfast pizza (comes with spicy sausage, sunny side eggs, and arugula) and it was really good. Their woodoven pizzas have always been my go to, love the thin crust and all the different toppings."}
{"text":"Went here with my co-workers for a work dinner.  I will outline a few good and bad things:  - The food was really good for the price. I thoroughly enjoyed my Chicken Parma. with Pasta as it came hot, well cooked and tasted delicious with the Tomato Sauce. The Cesar Salad was tasteful as well.  - The atmosphere was also really nice. A lot of different groups of people (young and older/mature). There were no loud kids or people who just stared at you while you are trying to enjoy your dinner. It was actually a surprise considering it was a Friday evening at the heart of Richmond Hill.  - The price of beer was a little bit overpriced. I paid around $20 for two pints of beer. Both were imported beers but at most restaurants, you will be paying around $15 for two pints of premium. Also got charged 15% gratuity on alcohol? I was going to tip and I did originally until my friend noticed that we got charged. I guess that is a new thing considering I do go to more expensive restaurants and do not get charged gratuity on the alcohol.  - The service was decent / 3/5. The waiter did come a few times to ask for drinks, but that was after about 20 minutes. I do see that the restaurant was busy but there were more than enough waiters / waitresses to assist. I may be a bit picky, but service is always extremely important in restaurants.  Over all, this would be a place I would recommend to people who want good food, with regular drinks once or twice a year. As a regular place to enjoy yourself, I probably wouldn't recommend it.  3/5 Stars."}
{"text":"The pasta here isn't worth coming a second time. I got the rigatoniverdura and let's just say it wasn't something I couldn't whip up in 20 min. The pasta was cooked al dente, a little chewy than usual, but edible. The dish wasn't as saucy as I liked and lacked bold flavours. My pasta was unevenly warm, some parts piping hot and others cold. I felt I was a little cheated, paying 17 dollars is a lot to ask for when fresh hot homemade pasta was not served. The bread to start was hard as rock, definitely not impressed.  When we first arrived we weren't greeted and again upon leaving, we weren't thanked. If you're looking to spend a weekend night in a restaurant with dim lighting eating mediocre Italian, well you found the place, look no further!"}
{"text":"It almost baffles me that this place has such horrible/mediocre reviews.  Pros: - Pizza fichi? Yes please. With a honey undertone, layers of gourmet cheese and greens, you really can't go wrong. It's a little sweet, a little tangy and just the right mix of \"this can't be too good for me, but it can't be thaaat bad\"  - It's in the heart of downtown Toronto (so I'm sure it's close to TTC transportation)  - Delicious gourmet pizzas, pastas, etc.  - Their drinks sound exotic (...venetian sunset? Allure me some more with your intricate vocabulary)  - They're going to be a part of Summerlicious this year! That's pretty cool. - The waitress that tended me was very sweet!   Cons: - At the mercy of DT parking and traffic (which always sucks)  - The other dishes seem a bit more pricey than the pizzas   I went here for a bachelorette party and it was nice. Granted, we were a little overdressed compared to the other patrons (then again, that really is beyond our control). But we weren't overdressed given the ambiance. It's a nice date spot. Very casual and classy yet relaxed. Toronto, you never fail to impress me."}
{"text":"Visited Saturday, Nov. 27 for dinner. Food was really good. Had the Bruschetta Pomodoro to start, then we had the Steak & Gnocchi and Chicken Parmigiana. Our waitress was nice and service was in good time. The only negatives were our table top was wobbly and my chair felt like if I moved it, it may break. Before leaving visited the restroom and almost slipped twice on some liquid on the floor. The bathroom is in desperate need of fixing. The ceiling was peeling, one sink was on a wonky angle on the wall, cracks in the walls and mouldy smell."}
{"text":"Seems like it's stuck halfway between a family restaurant and a fine dining establishment. Not a good fence to straddle. Very strange ambiance.  Dimly lit romantic decor with kids screaming and running about.   Entrees were mediocre. The Pizza Fichi was a drippy, oily mess. I traded a slice for a slice with my brother and his wasn't any better (can't recall what his was) I did quite like the Arancini appetizer but the portion for 9 dollars was tiny.   Extra star for their service. Both the hostesses and our waiter were fantastic."}
{"text":"Not bad considering the prime location. The fig pizza and desserts were quite good, and the service was pretty attentive, especially as our party showed up at different times and had a few requests."}
{"text":"It probably could be rated 2 stars but those 2-seater booths in the showcase-style windows at the front are worth a star. \"It's like we're in a fishbowl!\" said the Missus.   So, we've walked by Il Fornello plenty of times along the Danforth, usually on a Tuesday as I remember there always being a \"$10 Pizza Tuesdays\" sign out on the sidewalk, as well as the countless people sharing pizzas on the patio. Tonight, we wanted a place closest to home that wasn't a pub and this place fit the bill.   Speaking of \"the bill,\" while service, cleanliness, comfort & timing were all fine, I feel the pricing is the main issue here. The size of my $17 Lasagna was average, and while it was good, it had no \"wow\" factor. The missus had the Chicken Parmigiana which had the portion size (and taste? I can't remember, and I tasted it myself. That can't be good) and she was able to get 2 meals out of it.   We skipped the wine list and went for something from the tap, which included a selection of one (1) brand: Stella Artois. I respect that. As a restaurateur, how do you choose if you can only provide one brand of draught beer? Big, important decision. I think Stella was a fine choice.   Il Fornello was not a horrible experience, I just felt that I never got value for my dollar. We left feeling short changed.   In contrast, as I write this, it's the following day and I am in Montreal, having just returned from a local Italian restaurant . We ordered the exact same meals (although I had the parm this time, and the missus was not with me, I was having dinner with my Mom), and I walked out of there \"wowed.\" Incredible value, portion sizes, service and complimentary dessert & coffee because \"we were a couple of cool customers.\" My feelings towards Il Fornello took another hit, but it's hard to compare Montreal eating to anywhere else."}
{"text":"I recently got the app uber eats. Only a few selections in Richmond hill. Il Fornellos is definitely the best. Great menu. Lots of selection. I ordered the lasagna. Very tasty and generous serving. My brother got the margarita pizza. The pizza was literally gone within 10 mins. That's how good it was. Overall really good quality Italian food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not great food.  Nothing really under $18 which is a shame if you just want a little something."}
{"text":"There was a time many years ago it seems when this place knew how to make pizza.Last night we had a rude awakening.My wife attempted to order a gluten free pizza but received a cardboard plus pizza.She proceeded to pick off the veggies and the cheese goo from the top but couldn't get through the crust.She would have needed a blowtorch to do that.I had a pepperoni pizza which was as parched as the Sahara and the arugula salad was rather sad.This was not a great experience.Well it's back to Terroni for us."}
{"text":"This is a new location. I thought it was pretty good! I really liked the atmosphere, and the patio looked like a great spot to go for drinks with friends (I didn't use it, but I really wanted to!) The service was really good - attentive and polite. The food was good. It wasn't gourmet food - but it was really good. I had the chicken parm. Although I couldn't finish it all because I was so full..I really wanted to!  All-in-all I'd go back again! It's basically an Italian version of The Keg. And it's a great spot....must go back to sit on the patio!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a really nice meal here on my first night in Toronto. It strikes me as a fast-casual restaurant - yet they manage to create a warm interior that is inviting. We split a beet salad which was pretty standard and I went for the rigatoni with a Bolognese; the others tried the baked cannelloni and the salmon dinner. Perfectly fine meal - nothing terribly wrong and yet nothing out-of-the-ordinary \"hey welcome to Toronto let's do this up\" either. I would consider this a safe bet for a lovely Italian meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight evening. There is a pretty large patio which is great. Restaurant was surprisingly busy which was a good sign. I opted for the pizza funghi which was quite good. The lemon ricotta was a nice touch. Service was attentive. Pizzas are reasonably priced - they have a $10 deal for lunch and dinner on weekdays. I would definitely return if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times. The restraint is a nice casual place. The service has always been fine. Nothing over the top amazing but it has always been good. The food is good, again nothing amazing. I wouldn't say it is like home made Italian cooking but it is nice and fresh. I would come back here to eat if I was invited but I wouldn't choose Il Fornello's on my own. To many other great places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a random trip to the beaches ordered the fettacine alfredo. In my opinion the food is ok. The sauce was pretty tastless though. The brusetta starter was good and enough for two people. The service is decent although we made small talk with the folks beside us who had waited an hour for their chicken dish. Overall im not super impressed. I will probably choose another of the many cute places along here next time."}
{"text":"Yum!  I love the pizza here.  It's tasty and oh-so-gourmet.  I also really appreciate the variety of crusts.  I've had better, but I like this pizza a lot and know I can count on it for a good fancy pizza for when I'm in the mood.  A bit pricey however.  The service was fast and prompt which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday.  Interesting decor.  Not overly loud.  Casual.  Decent service.  Clean bathroom.  FOOD: Antipasto - Good amount of meats and cheese, but a tad pricey for what it is.  Also not nearly enough crostini!! Pizza Gorgonzola - You better like onion, because that's all I could taste.  Not a fan.  To be fair, this was an experiment for me as it's outside my norm.  Maybe I'll give them another try, or maybe not.  Time will tell (and convenience).  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I had the Pappardelle Salsiccia, which came out slightly on the buttery side but that's totally expected and well within reason.  We paid by split bill, and Christine made a scene out of the size of the tip paid by one of our group. Left a terrible taste, figuratively, as the meal was going well and 3 of us hadn't paid yet."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bite Wednesday night. Got seated right away. Shared a $10 pizza special and calamari. Food was great, service was friendly and multiple check-ins, warm comfortable decor. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Our local Il Fornello is a popular place for teenage girl birthday parties and it is deserved. Excellent with allergies and their server also handled our nearby table so he was giving us updates on where we were at with the bill.  There was another large birthday party there at the same time and it was also going very smoothly.  Food is consistently good. I had a large Roma salad that had really delicious sweetie peppers in it.  Washrooms were clean, restaurant large but cozy.  We have been here many times and will return again."}
{"text":"+.5 for service.  Came here for Summerlicious, as I was told this place does it well and have done it for several years. It can't be that bad, right? Upon entering, I noticed a Conditional Pass sign on the front door. Hmm...  I was seated promptly as I reserved a table of two. The place was busy! They were right saying if you don't reserve, you're certainly not guaranteed a seat. I arrived about 10 minutes before my friend, but my server allowed me to get started on drinks.  I ordered the insalata caprese, orrecchiette, and the vanilla panna cotta. With it came bread; similar to Il Fornaro in that aspect.  The bread was very hard and tough to eat. However, I liked the olive oil and stuff that came along with it (still can never figure out if it's green before brown or the other way around...).  The insalata caprese was interesting. It was relatively simple, with tomatoes and two chunks of mozzarella cheese. The tomatoes were definitely picked fresh, the mozzarella cheese had the right amount of taste, and the extra virgin oil added perfectly to the appetizer.  In terms of the orrecchiette, it was average at best. The pasta didn't seem to be fully cooked, as it kept sticking to one another. The cauliflower and spinach were a good addition, and the prosciutto was good as well. I asked for parmesan cheese, however my server put way too much on it...covered the whole plate (and the plate was big!).  The vanilla panna cotta was meh...the custard was good, but the berry sauce tasted way off for my liking.  One thing this place has over other Italian restaurants is the portion size. They're huge! My friend barely finished his insalata tonno e arugula and didn't finish his strawberry shortcake. While it didn't match up to Il Fornaro in terms of quality, the quantity somewhat made up for it."}
{"text":"I've read other people's comment amd I must say I don't agree with some people. I think the food, at least the pizzas we ordered, were delicious. I loved the caesar salad. I do agree that the service is not amazing, but I've had much worse. I'm definitely going back to try other items in their menu!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this place! Great customer service and the fish dishes never disappoint me. I will say this is the most decent place at bayview village to have a proper tasty meal.  I'm glad it's ok Uber too."}
{"text":"Il Fornello has been a regular haunt for 16 years now.  The Richmond hill location is our regular haunt.  It is clean, beautifully decorated, nice music,and a pleasure to eat at.  Good for families, or for an intimate meal.  I take business associates here for meetings as well.  This location is by far my favourite.  I've been to most, if not all locations.  The staff is fantastic and goes out of their way to make sure I'm treated like family, and that I always have something that I am able to eat.  They have for many years provided some of the most diverse choices for an Italian restaurant for anyone who must eat gluten free.  They provide normal food as well that is extraordinary, but for me I will review this as someone who has to maintain a strict gluten free diet.  The pizzas are quite good, and the pasta selection is great.  They have gluten free crusts and pasta, but what sets them apart from most restaurants that serve gluten free is that they also have several appetizers, soup, and main courses that are not just pasta and/or pizza options  I typically get the veal and have a nice butternut or minestrone soup.  Today I am having a higher protein version of \"pasta.\"  I have asked them to substitute vegetables for my pasta, and I am happy to pay extra to get a more low carb option.  They have been great in making substitutions for us as needed.   All three of us in our family must eat gluten free.  One of my absolute favourites!"}
{"text":"I love Il Fornello. I really do. But this location is the worst.  We ordered the beet salad, (beets came from a can) and the chicken parmesan, for me , a veggie pasta in tomato sauce with no pasta noodles.  My partners chicken was dry, and my veggie pasta was literally 3 broccoli trees and a couple of green beens (I can't have pasta noodles for health reasons, yes I can cook for myself, but we thought we would treat ourselves).  This cost 40 dollars for pick up. Absolutely horrid. I keep trying to give this location a chance but, never again."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times over the years. I don't get the good reviews? Service is fine, seems busy all the time but pizzas are lacking in flavour, pasta is dry and tasteless, salads are nothing special. I always feel the same way after eating here...I can't say it's bad but I don't walk away saying that was delicious and tasty. Bartender makes a damn good Caesar though...."}
{"text":"One of eight locations around Toronto, Il Fornello at Bayview Village is a safe bet for Italian food as there isn't much of a choice in this area. While it's also a safe bet for vegetarians (the pasta is cooked in vegetable stock), you can't be guaranteed a seat here at lunch on weekdays. It's most quiet here during the weekend brunch hours, between 10:30 am - 3:00pm, where there's all-you-can-eat scrambled eggs, pizza, roasted potatoes, pasta, salads and mussels ($12.99).  The a la carte menu here isn't large but has a balanced selection to please everyone.  On my first visit, I'd asked the waiter to tweek one of the linguine pesto without the pollo (i.e. chicken). Without much hesitation, he suggested that he could get me the spaghetti primervera with the pesto sauce. It had me licking my lips until the very end and I'm glad to see that they are willing to change the plates to please the customer.  Even though I generally choose white cream sauce over tomato-based cream sauces, the agnolotti fornello ($15.79) is quite satisfying, although a bit small!  I could easily devour two of these!    For dessert, the tiramisu here is quite delish and highly recommended.  3.5/5 STARS"}
{"text":"Horrible food, if your known for pizza and pasta how can a restaurant screw that up. I also must of had the worst service at this place as well, the waiter forgot our drinks a few times, and never checked on us about the food. We had yo ask for the bill 2 times before we got it finally , no wonder this place is not busy on a sat night."}
{"text":"This location is good because it has plenty of free parking and overall it's a bit more relaxed than some of the other locations. The menu isn't extensive but the gluten-free options make this a viable choice if you're looking for Celiac-friendly Italian dining.  I've noticed that this place is never as full as the nearby Oliver & Bonacini restaurant, but Il Fornello has recently started to offer brunch, so that's made them a bit more popular. The brunch buffet has limited choices but it's not a bad deal if you're fond of mussels.  My biggest criticism of this place is that they should offer more vegetables with entrées like pizza and pasta and especially the salad. They skimp on these and it just looks cheap."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Il fornello in years so I wasn't sure what to expect, they've definitely updated the interior and it looks great! The food was amazing and service was great as well! Everyone came out at the right times, service was polite and sweet. Over all great experience and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Il Fornellos is a regular spot for me since it opened in Ajax.  The best AUTHENTIC pizza to be had for many miles. It does make me smile when people say theirs was burned, I assume they have never eaten one in Italy - a little charring from a wood oven is to be expected and increases the flavor. I did sit next to one couple who sent their perfectly cooked pizzas back, (it's Ajax and philistines abound). The staff were incredibly courteous however, and did not bat an eye.... cooking exactly what was demanded. If you want flaccid, oily cheese on thick dough you should try Boston Pizza. Of course the menu has plenty of variety if you don't want pizza and the gnocchi is perfectly fluffy every time. I don't have any problem with portion size either, after reading some reviews you would think it was a \"nouvelle cuisine\" joint - I have never left hungry, always been offered bread, the staff are youthful, friendly and work hard. Maybe it is a North American thing to see a modest portion as small? I am certainly happier with quality over quantity. The place is always impeccably clean. As others have said - the fig pizza is very good. Monday night $5 authentic pizza - you can't go wrong for less than a Big Mac, would-be restaurant critics take note! In the meantime I am going every week and loving it."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this restaurant right before we saw a show at the princess of Wales theatre. The food was great, the service was great, and the prices were appropriate. If you're looking for some classic, easy Italian food, here it is.  I got the pasta alla Norma and added sausage to it, shared a Cesar salad, and my sister got spaghetti and meatballs. Large portions and all tastes good. Washed it down with a half liter of Chianti and the panna cotta."}
{"text":"Service was great, food really tasty lots of flavour.  Paper on the table as table cloth only thing that didn't seem like fit the restaurant.   Prices aren't too bad, a few are alittle much for pasta.    Menu could use a few more items on it.   The creme brûlée you must try!"}
{"text":"Yummy gorgonzola pear and carmelized onion pizza. Bruchetta good but not exciting. Nice spot on the water. Reasonable price"}
{"text":"Was here on a Wednesday night for a work outing. They were very accommodating for my large group of 15 people. Service was nice as they got drinks to us quickly and ensured we were always topped off. Apps arrived quickly and looked great. I ordered the steak and the waitress was knowledgable of the substitutes as I did not want the gnocchi. Had my gnocchi replaced with rapini side which was also cooked well. Steak was a bit on the bland side and the quality of the meat was average. Lots of people in the group opted for the chicken parm which seemed to have been the better option."}
{"text":"My colleagues took me out for lunch today to celebrate my birthday.  We went to Il Fornello at Yonge/St. Clair.    We've been there before and today was the busiest we've ever seen it.  Baljeet had Linguini Pollo Pesto ... she said it was good and would order it again.  Helene had Salsiccia Italiana pizza ... she too said she would order it again.  I usually order a pepperoni pizza there.  I'd been there yesterday with my manager (the restaurant selection where we work is slim) and that's what I had.  So I thought I'd try something different.  I love Chicken Parmigiana so that's why I ordered, as did Steve.  We both thought it was so-so, kinda blah, and we wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"I met my pals for supper there Friday night.  I usually get pepperoni pizza when I go to an Il Fornello.  But I've had a lot of pizza lately so thought I'd get Chicken Parm.  It was okay, not great.  There was a weird texture and taste in the tomato sauce ... maybe Parmesan cheese mixed in with it (I don't like Parm cheese)?  It was a big serving and I left some of the pasta.  Kat was our server and she took good care of us.  She was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  Keep an eye out for her ... she's going to be a star!"}
{"text":"Is it obvious I enjoy the food here.  Had lunch on one occasion.... Pizza was delicious, thin crush the way I like it.  We went for dinner on the weekend and both my husband and I had the seafood linguine.  It was delicious!!!! The pasta was perfectly cooked \"al dente\".  The meal was hot and there  was a generous helping of seafood on our plate.  Will definitely order this again.  My mum had the Fettuccini Alfredo, which was also very good.  Will I go back a third time?........I think it's safe to say I will."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a look for a classy celebration if you don't want to trek all the way downtown.  It's an upscale restaurant up north without the hassle of making it all the way down there. The service is great and so is the food. The only catch is the price tag associated with it if you are short on cash.  It's not uber pricey just a lot for food so I make a point to not go there often but once in a while to treat myself and my fiancee.  I usually end up getting the Linguine Salmone. If you do get it, I'd recommend you ask them to go easy on the smoked salmon, it tends to overwhelm the dish and can ruin it easily. Otherwise if it is light it can be a fantastic dish."}
{"text":"Try the pizza with Prosciutto and arugula. It's thin crust, very tasty! The service was fast and the servers are fun! It's a great location if you are planning on having dinner there before a show."}
{"text":"Upon entering and being seated, a huge waft of stinky odour hit my face (smelled like poop or something)... The whole time I kept asking what is that smell? I thought maybe it was their wooden furniture or flooring... but it couldn't be. It bothered me throughout the night and really just interefered with my whole dining experience. I was still guessing what that smell could be... a friend suggested it might be their parmesan cheese. But I've never come across this problem at any other Italian restaurant. Now reading another Yelper that this is indeed from the wooden flooring just changes my whole mind about the experience altogether. That is just absolutely disgusting that they kept the old flooring...who knows what mystery lies underneath it all.  I ordered off the summerlicious dinner menu for a fix price of 25$. It came with a choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert. Dinner rolls were complimentary. I got the Insalata Caprese (appetizer), Pasta Stefano (beef entree), Ice cream with Ontario berries. I would have to say the salad was my favourite part of the meal. The entree was huge but not amazing; I found that the beef tasted too dark/strong. I couldn't finish mine sadly... the food was not bad, but with the smell in the whole restaurant was making it hard as well. I would have to say that service is on the slow side... took forever to have our meals as well as dessert."}
{"text":"We have been coming here off and on for years, in fact we have been eating at Fornello since they opened their first spot at Bloor and Bathurst eons ago. The times that the meal has been a five (like tonight) we have come back again quickly. But there been times over the the last fifteen years when we have backed off entirely because of two or three mediocre experiences in a row.   Tonight was a busy Sunday so there was every reason to undercook (the most common past problem) in order to get meals plated but not this time. Salads, pizzas and pasta were all as good as you have any right to expect at this price.  Simply said, it's all about the chefs and right now they are dynamite!"}
{"text":"Service was great as always. However... u know there's a problem when the food u are consuming makes u believe they are just trying to cheap out on the ingredients.   I used to love this restaurant because the portions were large, generous amount of meat & rich flavouring. Unfortunately it is not the case anymore. Portions are small (I could finish it at one sitting...normally I need to bring half home). I ordered the Pollo Pesto & they  have since eliminated the cream sauce from before.  You must ask for it ( what?!). Even when u ask for it, the cream sauce is all watered down. Honestly...I could have made this at home.  They are probably advertising this as the new healthy approach. However, if I have to pay close to $20 for a small pasta it's just not worth the time. Stay home & cook it or go somewhere else.   The price of flour has gone up in the last two years but I would love to see them crawl  out of this hole."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better at a fraction of the cost at Il Fornello. To begin, I normally ONLY get seafood pasta anywhere I dine . This time I ordered a seafood mix with linguini- shrimp , scallops, calamari. Lo and behold, it arrives, so underwhelmed by its appearance. Now, I normally don't add grated cheese to the pasta, but the taste was bland and I ended up with cheese on my seafood pasta to try to revive it. On top of that I end up with a raw scallop that just too eeewwww .. slimy and fishy. I get the manager.. he does the correct thing, says that another one will be ordered on the house, I say please, I'm starving. This time it's  prettier in appearance, yet for some reason I feel it again that the scallops are not thoroughly cook... ( as if the fire was too hot and they cooked too fast and the inside wasn't quite cooked at the risk of burning the outside). Manager comes after I request for him, he thinks that its cooked I say I don't think so.. at this point Im full on bread and salad and I don't wanna miss my movie. I am told that its probably in my head at this time , I'm thinking probably but I know how to cook scallops.. I just don't think its in my head. Over all, place is nice, server was attentive, manager followed protocol  when there's an oopsey . Will I go back? Never, Would I recommend Il Fornello? Nope. The food all around wasn't up to par, lacked visual presentation and real Italian flare/ taste."}
{"text":"Complete disappointment. Everything from the ambiance, food, service, and drinks was sub par"}
{"text":"Il Fornello. A nice italian family restaurant.   I've been to this Il Fornello for many a family dinner. You can usually find somewhere to sit, the service is friendly, and the food is good. Plain and simple. And not to shabby. It doesn't blow my mind, but i sure don't hate it either.   They're tomato salad is so great. Ditto pesto pasta."}
{"text":"This place is really good for last minute, big-group lunches, but the food is pretty mediocre. I've been here a few times and the food is normally okay, but I had a really bad pasta last time I went (the special salmon and lemon one - don't get this). I would've given this place 2 stars if they weren't so good at accommodating large numbers of us last minute."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 stars. My wife and I eat here every couple months, and have for the past many years. Over time it feels like the food quality just isn't there anymore, things feel a bit more rushed. Things a little burnt, flavours just not quite as 'bright'. I've tried other locations and this one was always the best, but it feels to be similar to the rest now.  Service is a 4 for sure, as is the atmosphere. I'll probably keep returning, but it's definitely not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Il Fornello is located on Highway 2 between Harwood and Salem on the South side in the same plaza as McDonalds and Smokes Poutinerie. My boyfriend and I came in here on a Tuesday evening around 7.  We were seated right away  and were given a specials/extras menu as well as the regular menu - on Tuesdays pizzas are only $10 and they had a few extra specials they were offering this month. We ended up ordering a mini pizzetta which had cheese, sauce and prosciutto on it and I went with the Gnocci Asiago and my boyfriend got the Lamb Shank.  Shortly after we ordered we had some bread delivered to the table while we waited for our appetizer. Now I may be nitpicking, but at a restaurant that looks as nice as this one does and has some amazing fire grilled pizza, you'd think they could NOT give out butter packs. I would have preferred to see a little container of butter or something instead of a bunch of butter packs thrown in. The bread was good, nothing amazing but a nice start.  The mini pizzetta was quite good, thin crust, not too much sauce, enough cheese for it to be stringy and good sized slices of prosciutto. I think the only thing I would change about this is to make the pieces of prosciutto smaller since there was only one piece (maybe two) per side and they were hard to bite through in one bite so they would slide off the pizza. Otherwise, a nice start to our meal.  The Gnocci Asiago was quite good, I had quickly popped on yelp to see if anyone recommended anything and this one stood out. Soft pillowy gnocci tossed in an asiago cream sauce with baby spinach and crispy onion strings on top. While the sauce was rich, it wasn't super heavy and neither was the gnocci. It's hard to find good gnocci that aren't gummy or chewy and these were melt in your mouth amazing. I couldn't finish the entire thing but I kept going back for more even after I said I was finished.   I did try a bit of the lamb shank and while my boyfriend quite enjoyed it, it didn't do it for me. The lamb was a bit dry and the potoatoes weren't anything special but since I only had one bite, I can't really give an accurate description.   Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, good food, good service and a nice atmosphere in the restaurant. We'll be back to try Il Fornello again."}
{"text":"The basil in our Caprise salad was wilted.  The pizza was okay.  Nothing extroridinary.  The pasta was bland.   Other then that the food was good but just nothing to exciting about it."}
{"text":"My first bad review...  Went there for dinner Saturday evening.  Drinks were watered down (Vodka Soda) so I ordered both separately.  I have been bartending for over 14 years and KNOW what a 1oz is.  We got a quarter of an oz.  Not good when the shot is supposed to be a 1oz OBVIOUSLY~!  No cutlery on the table when the food came.  Had to wait for that.  Then had to wait for hot sauce that we asked for twice.  BUT overall, the waitress was a sweet girl.  Friendly and sweet.  I forgive ;)  Now onto the food, MY OSSO BUCCO dish was drowning.  In cooking shows, they always teach the chefs to let the meat sit so it doesn't soak the plate with its juices.    MY plate looked like it was drowning in meat juice or something...My mashed potatoes were wet and my greens were mushy too.  Overall, osso bucco tasted good but that was it.  The dish looked like a BIG NOT HOT MESS.  Won't be going there again as its my second bad experience with the food."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place.... she always goes to the one by her house in Ajax.  We shared the Fried Calamari... very good.    1 friend ordered Linguini dI Mare (mixed seafood) and said it was really good.    My other friend ordered a Fichi pizza (her regular... called something else at the other restautant); figs, honey, arugula, prosciutto, marscapone... what kind of toppings is this for a pizza? AMAZING!  Who ever thought of this is a genius!  I ordered Orrechiette pasta; shrimp, scallops, tomatoes, garlic, fennel on saffron sauce.  It came out looking like a curry dish... but once you taste it... OMG!  Amazing!  This dish will definalty have me coming back for more.  Great service and great company."}
{"text":"Il fornello is one of those neighborhood staple restaurants that are very reliable and have been around for a very long time, and eventually grown to have multiple locations. I remember eating at various Il Fornellos ever since I was old enough to afford a meal out. Over the years, I have stopped eating there, not because it is not good, but rather I was drawn to the many different types of restaurants that have shown up.  I was invited here for a tasting event recently, and I was reminded just how solid the food here is. Prices are very reasonable, and most if not all dishes are under $20 - something that is very rare nowadays at sit-down restaurants especially at a somewhat high-end mall like Bayview Village.  For my tasting, I have tried their freshly baked pizzas (Margherita, and pizza with procuitto and arugula), mushroom risotto, beet salad, and squash ravioli - all items are very solid and tastes good. I was also informed of their 2-course prix fixe lunch menu ($18) and Monday pizza + beer special ($15), which both sounded like a steal to me.  Il Fornello is a solid 4 stars. The price-to-taste ratio here is perfect, and I would definitely come back when I feel like some good standard Italian fare."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location with my family because we live in Durham region and I had a craving for authentic Neapolitan pizza.  I read some online reviews that said Il Fornello has a pizza night and they make Neapolitan style pizza.  I was hesitant but the craving was too strong.  I called ahead and made a reservation and even asked the person who took my reservation to ask the manager or the kitchen if they made AUTHENTIC Neapolitan pizza.  After waiting for a few minutes, she came back and assured us that indeed they do make Neapolitan pizza.  I was exited and ready to go.  To make a long story short, we ordered Margherita pizza and the disappointment was real.  This was not even close to being Neapolitan pizza.  I've eaten in 5 of Toronto's highly YeLp ranked Neapolitan pizza restaurants and while there is obviously some differential in taste in each restaurant, a Neapolitan pizza lover can tell all of them are authentic Neapolitan pizza joints.  Il Fornello on the other hand?  Nope.  The pizza wasn't bad at all but it's not Neapolitan pizza and I'm hoping if you guys read this, you would stop telling people that it is."}
{"text":"I hadn't gone to the Bayview Village location in years because I was always disappointed, but thought I would give it another try last night ....to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I ordered the ravioli for $17.00.  The sauce tasted like bottled Ragu and the ravioli I buy at Loblaws (the PC brand) tastes better,    The dessert however was excellent - chocolate/raspberry tartuffo.  In the end, I will not go back, unless it's for a coffee and dessert.  I used to love this restaurant - don't know why it has detiorated to such a degree over the years."}
{"text":"My friend lives in the Beaches and there are so many restaurants to choose from and i was so glad we chose to come in here.  We both decided to order pizza, and they have a wood fired oven, so it cooks the pizza nicely.  I had a pizza with arugula, figs and honey on it and it was delicious.  The pizzas on there own are too much to eat so we both had half of our pizzas wrapped up.  btw, remember to grab ur leftover pizza, i still regret not gng back to get mine after i reaalized i had forgotten it."}
{"text":"Restaurant is nice and food is decent. No complaints there. After some back and forth the restaurant eventually added another small table to make it comfortable for our party of 5. Waitress was average in terms of a service, nothing wowed me.   Refills for coke are extra? Not impressed. Never paid more for refills. I did not like that.  Decent restaurant. I may go back."}
{"text":"In one word: average.   My friend and I went on a Friday night but the restaurant was fairly vacant (it didn't get busy until about 6:30pm). We wanted a booth, however, and they had all been booked. I ordered the gnocchi, which was not spectacular nor terrible. Service was great in the beginning, but our server was very slow in the end when my friend and I asked for individual receipts after she had brought a combined one.   On the bright side, there's free bread (baguettes, I believe) with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. But I'm not sure the bread alone is worth paying a second visit."}
{"text":"I actually made a Yelp account so I can warn others about their MEDIOCRE food, sub par atmosphere and the WORST service you will ever experience at any restaurant, not just in Durham but in the GTA.  The wait staff in the evenings has attitude like you've never experienced, they are condescending and have no real knowledge of customer service.  It is the type of establishment that acts like they're doing YOU a favour by serving you.  Its unfortunate but most other Il Fornellos especially Bayview and Downtown are quite the opposite even in terms of food.  Ajax, please pull up your socks; if not a change in staff, at least a lesson or two in people skills and how to earn your tip instead of just expecting it."}
{"text":"Call me a snob but this restaurant needs an upgrade. Think former beauty queen cat lady. Or former quarterback dirty old man.  They used to be beautiful... not anymore.   Right in the heart of theatre district, Il Fornello lacks in showmanship. The silverware, the menu, the appearance and even the menu card are just dated. After being there for an hour, I feel like I have grown a moustache. Yes, moustache, it's so Miami Vice.  There's no soup for the day... it doesn't change. If went back tomorrow, I would find the same tasteless celery (I think) soup. I used to eat at Il Fornello after gym to gain back the fat I had lost (Ha!) but now I find it boring. Either my palette has matured or their quality has just gone bad.   The Pizza, oh the healthy Gorgonzola pizza for sure taste like Gorgonzola along with Gorgonzola after taste that cuts through your nose.   This place is good for lunch, but not for dinner. Don't come here if you want to impress your client, you will lose the account."}
{"text":"Went for Friday night dinner. Place wasn't busy compared to the neighboring restaurants. Kids menu is very limited and no option to modify for allergic reasons. Place is very outdated and had a bad smell. Food was sub-par. Service was ok. Not a place to recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, as I know it's a \"faux-talian\" chain restaurant, but actually, the food was largely abysmal.  We ate:  Caprese Salad - overripe, mealy, watery tomatoes with not enough oil and balsamic (maybe watered down by the tomatoes?) and some decent bocconcini cheese.  Calamari - this was actually pretty good, with a nice non-rubbery texture and crispy exterior.  4 oz grilled chicken breast special - dry and bland with bland, watery green vegetables (rapini, green beans) that really needed some fat and salt on them.  Chicken parmaggiano - a relatively tender chicken breast dredged in greasy breading and topped with way too much melted cheese. Served atop thick, over-cooked linguini with bland tomato sauce. Pasta had the texture of that pre-cooked stuff that comes in a bucket and you run hot water over it.  Rack of lamb - lamb was okay (overcooked from our specifications of medium-rare) but served atop watery, lumpy mashed potatoes with a side of bland green beans.  No complaints about the service, but man was that food awful. For a city with such a huge Italian population, this really was a disappointment. Will not return."}
{"text":"this is mediocre at best, service sucks. totally in shock. coming from Montreal where service is known to be bad, but great food. this place is terrible. the server, who also doubles as a bartender, hadn't even heard of the beer i ordered from their menu. the fettucine wasn't cooked and when we sent it back to the kitchen, they simply recooked the same pasta and brought it back. we had to repeatedly ask for things like cutlery and napkins as these items were notably absent from the table. i would never go back. this place is irredeemable."}
{"text":"Came here Thursday night with my mother and sister. Restaurant was pretty empty, more busy during the weekend I feel. Service was good and the food was delicious as always. The portions are great at this location. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nice classy Italian restaurant in Greek town. Their $10 pizzas lured me in (dine-in only). Most of the pizzas that are part of the promotion don't have meat on them but  there are a few. You can check out my picture of the menu. I offered the pizza prosciutto and it was much larger than I expected and a good amount of topping. My boyfriend and I weren't very hungry so we just ordered one pizza to try it out. They brought it out on 2 separate plates and I thought that was a thoughtful gesture. Pizza had a VERY thin crust which was soft and chewy. Pizza was very delicious. Would come back for pizza even without the promotion. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Ill Fornello near Yonge and High Tech has stood the test of time in what is generally an unforgiving location for restaurants. It is easy to see why after my most recent visit.   The space is very open and contemporary. I think they will be quite capable of hosting a 10+ group so long as they're not busy (not on Friday nights). The ambiance is family-oriented but will not offend any other crowd.   They have a big selection of pastas and Neapolitan style thin crust pizzas. I had the Rigatoni Bolognese ($16), which is essentially a hearty meat sauce over al dente pasta. The dish was very rich and filling.   The standout item on their menu is the Fig pizza ($16). It is a strangely delightful medley of mascarpone and prosciutto topped with figs and honey. The mildness of the mascarpone serves as the perfect backdrop to the sweet flavours of fig and honey. Similar styles of pizza that I've tried elsewhere normally use goat cheese, which I find to be too strong and overpowering.    The gluten-challenged wil be happy to know that they provide alternatives for both their pizza crusts and pastas. The substitutions do cost an additional $5 for pizza and $2 for pasta.   The service is also applause-worthy. The gentleman server/owner (I think) was a prince. He was very attentive and pleasant. We learned later that he had kept us in more than an hour passed their normal closing time.   You will not be ill-advised to  go to Il Fornello."}
{"text":"Came again a couple weeks ago and hated the service. There were items that we ordered, which never came and it was impossible to flag down our waitress, which meant that our waters were rarely topped. All in all terrible service which I never had when I came here before. That really put a damper on our dinner and was a continuous topic of discussion.  The food itself also dipped in quality, had the salmon pizza again and found the crust and dough to be overcooked - it was hard to bite into and just not good."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in such a central location I should have known to run the opposite direction when my friend and I walked in to a half empty restaurant on a Friday. To be fair its a fairly large restaurant but I have been walking past this place for the longest time and was kind of curious how bad it could be. Turns out it was pretty bad. Not awful, but definitely not good. It is everything you would expect from a tourist trap that pretends to be a real restaurant. Service was lacking for a half empty restaurant, the salad I had was nowhere near as good as the salads I can get from IQ or even Freshii (depressing, I know). The pasta was also just sad. As in I rarely cook but can make way better pasta. This is what I get for being curious and I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"The service and ambience was good, but the food was okay.. maybe I should have ordered something different. I had the Connolly and it was kind of plain.. it tasted bland and boring, and like the other reviewer said, its missing that 'something'. My red wine was good, can't go wrong. My dessert was good (crème Brule) but not the best.. I had better. It was my first time, so I don't know if I would go again.. but I herd good reviews for the Toronto location, so maybe I will give this restaurant another chance, and I said Maybe."}
{"text":"Il Fornello Restaurants at Bayview Village is located right across from O&B. Talking about competition!  Il Fornello does has this Winter Special Menu for $15 that includes a choice of appetizer and main.. no dessert though. But this offering seems to be on going through out the year.  The restaurant was busy even around 1:30 pm but there was no wait. Services was slow at time until the table next to me start complaining then all the food just arrive so fast!  Mixed Green, Arugula Salad with Apple and Walnut - portion size is good but just a little too heavy on dressing and get a little soggy  Gnocchi in Tomato Sauce Finished with Ricotta di Bufala - Gnocchi has this great chewy texture cooked al dente - the sauce was kind of generic, does remind me of something from the can...  I definitely think Il Fornello is under staff, the wait staffs are overwhelmed and that led to decline of services.   All pizza for $10 on Tuesday sounded like a good deal... I probably be back to try out their pizza!"}
{"text":"3.5 star  Maybe I was lucky? Maybe it was a Sunday?  I have quite a decent meal at Il Fornello and the service was terrific!   Linguine di Mare ($19) - too saucy and that made the pasta a little too soggy - Seafood is plentiful and fresh: Mussels, Calamari, Shrimps and Scallops  Rigatoni Bolognese ($16) - pasta cooked al dente with a good bit and texture - meat sauce is rich and bold  Chocolate Souffle ($11) - a little overpriced with the portion  - More like a warm brownie with ice cream but really hit the spot! I am biased with warm chocolate everything  Service... Attentive and Cheerful... I love my waiter! He alone worth that extra 0.5 star!  Will try to come back on Tuesday for their $10 Pizza Special! Hopefully really soon!"}
{"text":"This location of Il Fornello is a great King St. dinner option. If, like me, your parents come downtown for your graduation and you need a place to eat that isn't going to kill your bank account forever, this place is a good option for that.   Don't get me wrong, it's not cheap by any means. But it's one of the less pricey places on King, and they have great Italian food. Inside, it's usually filled with bankers and people who eat this kind of food as often as I eat $5 pho. I'd say it's a dressier place later in the evening -- definitely leave your favourite jeans at home and maybe put on a darker pair but don't go in a prom dress.  The food is deliiiiicious. Pasta, pizza, steak, fish, everything with an Italian flavour but made a little bit modern. Lots of stuff with truffles in it...which usually equals pricey. Pizzas can go as low as $12 or $13, pastas start at around $15 and mains go well over $20. Pizzas are kinda tiny but the pastas are decent portions. I think my mom took half of hers home after the meal, while I scarfed mine down no problem and then had an aching belly for a couple hours.  If you're in the city, you want a fancy meal out, but you don't want to totally break the bank or be on a waiting list for 5 years, Il Fornello is a great option. It's also right across from the Royal Alexandra Theatre, so is a popular choice for food before a show. Make reservations or arrive early to ensure you get fed!"}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner Friday night, food was ok but nothing spectacular. Speaking with people around us and nobody enjoyed their meal. We had the asiago chicken and salmon meals. Asiago chicken was tasteless, I did not detect a hint of asiago, my wife had the salmon which smelled fishy... Not a good sign for 'fresh' fish. My meal was cooked ok just tasteless and no wow factor. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Dreadful.   I went with a groupon.   Had the Cesar salad... Bleh.   Had the gnocchi gorgonzola, that was good, except for forgetting the walnuts.   Lamb shank had very little flavour, the jus had a bit, but the shank itself should have been well seasoned, which it wasn't.     Service from Dave was not great.     Then they put tip on the bill automatically, which is not legal.   Even if the menu stares that they do it for large groups, if you ask them not to, they can't!!  I was shocked.   Like they thought people using a groupon wouldn't tip well, so they did it for us.   Never again.     And someone should tell the owners that it's illegal to apply tip to a bill, especially without informing the customer in advance."}
{"text":"We were seated next to a wood pillar blooming with winter coats. My date had to sit sideways to avoid getting her face obscured with a parka. Without any prompting a hostess asked us if we'd like to move to a less crowded table stern-side. How sweet. We enjoyed the rest of dinner in full view of the kitchen and watched them prepare my delicious beet salad and fig pizza. The pizza was delicious but not something I'd get again: too rich. The service was great and I look forward to coming back.  Obligatory Title Pun: Hardcore FORN.  Menu Readability: Meh.  Need to mention: Mention that you've got tickets for a show and they'll get your order going as quickly as possible.  What this place teaches me about myself: I guess not every hostess in Toronto is \"out to get me.\""}
{"text":"About a month ago we tried this place and I was pleasantly pleased with it, has a very nice relaxing atmosphere, very nice dinner experience. the food was fantastic from the bread and $10 pizza to the sea food linguini, fettuccini alfredo and the white wine we got for dinner it all was done to perfection, it was absolutely fantastic.  The staff was friendly the dinner experience was great and the food fantastic."}
{"text":"My most recent experience was bad enough to make me cringe. It was my second time, first being a relatively pleasant one at the Richmond Hill location.   I usually don't think too much about service, but it was bad enough this time for me to mention. I came on a quite busy weeknight and was taken to my unset table where my server would not approach us until after 10 minutes of aggressive/awkward eye contact. I usually find complaints towards general service inadequacies to be petty attempts at a more sophisticated restaurant review, but it literally took me more than 4 requests to two different servers including my own to have my water filled just once, and the overabundance of sodium in the dishes didn't help much either.  We ordered the orecchiette (lamb sausage pasta) and pizza polpo (octopus).   The lamb pasta was so badly done, the dish was almost like a microwaved dinner; the meat was chewy, the pasta was disproportionately cold and hot, and the residual oil was overwhelming to my palette. The lamb was absolutely horrible; the gamey taste lingered and i strongly question the overall freshness of their produce.   The pizza was okay but it was generally incohesive and the sauce and toppings were disheveled while the base was borderline frozen. Seafood dishes are usually paired with zestier additions which this dish lacked, resulting in an unremarkable plate of loosely placed ingredients.   At $20+ per person, located at a upscale shopping mall I really expected more than a Pizzaiolo/Michelina's pasta experience  Suggestion: at an indoor mall it is awkward to have a wannabe outdoor patio section, plus the glass panels adjoining the two sections were too divisive and it felt like we were unwelcomed spectators to another Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner, we all ordered off the winterlicious' menu which was around $30 for 3 courses. I got the Arancini for my starter, then the asiago chicken as a main, and creme brûlée for dessert. The Arancini was really flavourful with a crispy shell and stuffed with mozzarella. The chicken was okay, it was juicy but lacked seasoning the asiago was a nice stuffing but didn't do much for the flavour. And last but not least the creme brûlée, it was average, nothing special but it was still good. I remember I came to il fornello a couple weeks before this date and the service was really bad, our entree came to the table before our bread! But I have to say this time around service was much better I told the server that it was our friend's birthday, he said they don't do anything special for birthdays however when dessert came out, he brought her dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday! Overall good meal and nice service, if you're in the area you should definitely stop buy and give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm starting to lose faith in chain restaurants, as most of them usually just churn out boring, generic and commercial-tasting food. Despite this, I always feel compelled to give them a chance, and sometimes I am pleasantly surprised. Il Fornello, however, falls into the category of chain restaurants that disappoint me.  For appetizer, our group shared a calamari fritti: Sardinian spiced deep fried calamari with lemon aioli. The calamari was really mediocre, and the sauce was just bland.  I sampled the pasta special of the day: Porcini mushroom filled ravioli with roasted red pepper with cream sauce. It was basically commercial ravioli slathered with a mount of heavy cream sauce. I was not impressed.  I usually love Lasagna, but I really felt that Stouffers microwavable lasagna taste a lot better than this one. The sauce tasted like canned tomato purée that I can get at any supermarket. It was also missing that browned cheesy crust on top that I love.   Needless to say, I will not be returning to Il Fornello. A lot of other chain restaurants offer much better \"fake\" Italian food."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my girlfriend as we were in the area and looking for a great Italian restaurant. I have to say this place was a huge disappointment for us.   Upon walking in, the ambiance was very nice but there was a stench that was very unsettling. We decided to overlook it and try the place out anyway. Our table was nice and it wasn't too busy inside. It can come across as somewhat fancy but I didn't get that vibe since most people including ourselves were dressed casually.   We ordered 2 drinks: Malbec from Argentina and a margarita. The wine was ok - can't really go wrong there but the margarita was horrible. The drink was watered down and didn't even come in a proper margarita glass.   We ordered the Roma salad as our app and that was pretty good. Flavourful and light however we did feel they could put more goat cheese for the price of the salad. Unfortunately, the complimentary bread served as a side app looked store bought and came with little plastic tubs of margarine. Not how bread is usually served at an Italian restaurant. What a big disappointment.   For our mains we ordered spaghetti and meatballs and pasta di mare. In the menu, the meatballs were described as homemade and filled with ricotta. The meatballs were horrible! They did not taste homemade nor was there any sign of ricotta. They definitely tasted store bought to me. The pasta too was very bland and the sauce was watered down. A huge disappointment!! The pasta di mare looked just as bland as the spaghetti. In fact they looked like the same dish only one has meatballs and the other had seafood. My girlfriend did not enjoy her pasta dish either. And the entire menu is quite overpriced for the quality.   Unfortunately we felt that this was not an authentic Italian restaurant. There are so many other options in the area that are WAY better than here. We were not impressed with the food and the service was ok. Our tummies were not feeling so great after dinning here. There is absolutely no way we would come back here. Even if it were free!!"}
{"text":"The location is convenient in the theater district with a pleasant interior that is conducive to conversation and lingering. I just am not that impressed with the food.  For the quality, I find the prices high.  The dishes I have tried were decent but not particularly inspired.  The salmon, as an example was dry and had been overcooked.  I enjoy salmon on its own but it has to be well prepared.  I used the accompanying sauce that was in a bowl to mask it but it wasn't what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Decided I want some Italian food tonight, and took a detour here since it was close to my work.  I noticed it had Spaghetti Bolognese so I decided to let it take the challenge to see if I would like it even if it was ridiculously pricey $18.  Started with 3 slices of bread, wasn't refilled nor offered for refill.  They don't provide butter but they provided the oils.  Fortunately I knew how those worked, but I still prefer the good old butter.  I didn't really notice how long it took, because I was in the middle of finishing Professor Layton and the Last Spectre.  So whether it was long or not was not relevant for me.  First impression I got was... is this what I ordered?  The server said yes it was Spaghetti Bolognese.  I was like okay... first of all it didn't look meaty, it looked like over watered sauce with some feckles of meat.  So I tried eating it, but unfortunately my first impression was still spot on.  It wasn't too meaty, and was primarily very watery from too much tomatoes I guess.  There wasn't the balance of meats that I expect from a good Bolognese sauce.  Service was standard for a Downtown Toronto restaurant.  At this moment I won't give this place a good rating just because my experience with the food was way too overpriced and the quality is just a tad better than the cheap HK cafes.  I am also not a fan of the dark atmosphere, it's hard to see and appreciate the food.  That's one thing I like about Shiso Tree Cafe is the lights are bright so I get to see the food."}
{"text":"Waiter...there is a fly in my beer!  No Joke. It was in my beer, my food, my face... Though the staff and management did their friendliest best to keep us from walking out, it was a poor experience. Fruit flies were in season and they probably did what they could but they were everywhere. It would have been best for them not to sit anyone near the east wall. One decided to go swimming in a freshly served beer. Another ended dive bombing into a glass of water.  Nonetheless, we trudged on. We haven't been back since ... forever. Not sure why - it wasn't the fly last time - for sure.  OK to the food. We ordered the antipasti with crostini, a pizza, and something else (wasn't memorable I guess.) The antipasti was a few slices of cold cuts and stale bread. No figs, no cheese, just a few olives. For what the price was, we could have bought the whole package of prosciutto. The pizza was pretty good - a main stay for them. The manager realized that we are not doing well and did his best but when it comes down to it, it is the food and atmosphere and not the conversation that makes the restaurant. If I want to chat, I'd go to confession. BTW - I don't believe that the fly was doing a backstroke!  This happened at the end of July but I thought it was worth posting."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends.    I got the lasagna. My friends got the gnocchi with white and with rose sauce with hot water and wine!  Started with bread. It was hard and cold. Seemed like it was leftovers from lunch that they just put in the fridge.  The lasagne was delicious. I want to eat it every Monday night. \"On Mondays we eat ll fornello  lasagne\".  Would have been  a 4 or more but the bread, the waitress had two tables and spent most of the time chatting with the hostess.  Get the lasagne!!"}
{"text":"Food is hugely overpriced for what it is - a typical small-portion \"Italian\" (and you mean Tano-Americano here) stuff. Pasta? Don't think about it. Pizza? Would be ok if you never tried the \"media-masa-media-grasa\" real thing.  Wine selection is bad. And I really dislike when people recommend anything from Europe with that specific look on their faces like: \"You obviously got no clue, so just buy this one... Or you can buy another one which is cheaper, like a loser you are...\" Though if you'd jokingly ask him where Chandon imported the grapes for their Malbec from, he'd be annoyed.  As for the design, service and other non-eatable, but important sides - those are ok. Even good, actually. I assume that at least part of what I'm overpaying for the food goes to the maintenance people who keep the place in such a good shape.  Would I go there myself? No. Would I hesitate if someone else will invite me there? Yes."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a very casual restaurant but once you get inside there is a nice atmosphere going on. My friend and I made reservations for 8:15pm and our table was ready right away. They had a bunch of things I wanted to try in the appetizers section but we really wanted only pasta this time.  Service was great, our server was very prompt in getting us drinks and giving us time to look at the menu. My friend ended up getting the gnocchi with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, pomodoro sauce and basil. I got the tagliatelle bolognese with a braised beef and pork tomato sauce which was pretty tasty but wow my friend's gnocchi was amazing. It was cooked very well and had great flavour.  I recommend this place for pasta if anyone is ever in the area."}
{"text":"After Mariko's review, I was pretty skeptical about this place.. so, turns out, she's right on many things!   paper napkins. check  I mean, they're in a mall, how high class can that be, right?  no need to dress up. check! great service. check!   the Fettuccine Alfredo $14 was SO bland.. THAT was a disappointment. Luckily, I didn't get that... I ordered the Funghi pizza $14.50, baked in their \"hand crafted wooden oven\" (which is kinda cool and it's nice!). It was alright :) BIG and I couldn't finish. I had the wondrous pleasure to try out my friend's dish, Cannelloni Formaggio $17 (also baked in the pizza oven!) and that was really good! Extremely filling from yummy cheese.  Overpriced. check!   Overall, hmmm.... Could spend my $40 for two (and without appetizers!) elsewhere. Otherwise, GREAT SERVICE! He checked up occasionally on us, made us laugh, came to fill up our water, and we were very well taken care of. The evening was enjoyable. He gave us a delicious tiramisu for my friend, the birthday girl, and had the restaurant sing her a birthday song. That was so sweet :) 4 stars for that!  p.s. birthday girl said she couldn't reserve a table in advance. We had a table of 10... but was seated really quickly. Waiter didn't shoo us out even though we didn't start ordering til an hour later (due to MANY late friends)."}
{"text":"Yuck. Horrible service. I was never given silverware! Pizza was not very good. Would not recommend to a friend. Oh...did I mention the waitress never refilled my water?!"}
{"text":"Love that there is an Il Fornello now located right in the heart of Ajax so I don't have trek all the way downtown Toronto!  This location has a great vibe and is very bright looking with it's white brick walls and beautiful dark hardwood floors, high grey industrial looking ceilings, and lots of funky hanging lamps. They even have a large bar side and a lovely patio!  We had an awesome waiter, who was really helpful and funny. We took all his suggestions and ended up ordering all his favourite dishes. The boy definitely has great taste because everything we ate tasted phenomenal.  This is what we ordered:  Pizza Pollo \"BBQ\"  - Tomato sauce, mozzarella, slow roasted chicken, chipotle BBQ sauce, charred red onions +add bacon for $3 more The thin and chewy crust with crisp edges definitely packed that beautiful wood burning flavour. The pizza was packed with ample fresh toppings, real sliced chicken breast, gooey melty mozzerella, and the sweet & spicy bbq sauce plus the crunch from the crispy salty bacon helped hit all the flavour bases.  Gnocchi Asiago - House made gnocchi with asiago cream sauce, spinach & crispy shallots Wowww was this ever good! That lush rich creamy asiago cream sauce was soo delicious I wanted to drink up all the remnants left over after I ate all those plump pillowy gnocchis and the addition of the crispy shallots which were like mini onion rings added just the right crunch!  Tagliatelle Stefano - w/ slowly braised beef short ribs in tomato sauce Perfectly cooked al dente pasta and those tender flavourful fall off the bone meaty ribs were perfection.  Finally onto the dessert which our waiter also recommended, totally knocked it out of the ball park!  Double Pistachio Gelato - Double scoop of creamy pistachio gelato evenly blended with real pieces of pistachios. Perfect balance of sweet and salty, loved the intense taste of pistachios with every bite and the crunchy bits of real pistachios evenly blended throughout plus the addition of the gingersnap biscuits on the side was a pleasant surprise. Pistachio is now my favourite flavour!  Overall a spectacular meal from start to finish. I can not flaw a single thing, our waiter was very attentive the whole night, refilling our glasses without mention, making superb recommendations, food was fresh, flavourful, and delicious to the last bite. I'm will definitely be returning here!"}
