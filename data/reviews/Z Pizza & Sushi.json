{"text":"Z's has it all.  Whether you just want an awesome cheese pie or one of their many specialty dishes.  The best part is the sushi is amazing, i never would have thought of the concept on my own but i guess thats why they are running the business.  I highly recommend trying the sushi even if you just grab a roll with the rest of your order.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed and like myself will most likely become a huge customer of the sushi.  Ultimately, if you are in the area and have an opportunity  to give it a try dont pass it up, youll be very pleased you didnt."}
{"text":"Glad this place went under. That dude Cameron was a douchebag. What kind of respectable pizza place does sushi? Lmao. Pizza was typical, western PA conveyor belt crap. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Their pizza is average at best. They claim to be the 3rd best pizza in Pittsburgh, but not on Yelp, TripAdvisor, Pittsburgh Magazine, Thrillist and Foursquare. Their website doesn't give a reference to their high ranking so I'm left to assume that they're making it up.   About their pizza. The dough is soft and droopy and has no crisp or crunch to it. It reminds me of Sam's Club pizza. The bottom of the crust has dimples which is indicative of pizza cooked in a conveyor oven not your usual brick or stone oven which is the only way to cook pizza (imo).  It tasted ok but I'm sticking with my usual pizza place.   Also, I'm not sure I like the idea of a pizza and sushi restaurant. I think the owners should consider one or the other.  That's just an opinion."}
{"text":"Z pizza was kind enough to donate a gift certificate for a large pizza for the National Night Out our neighborhood hosted, and since we won we took the family out to dinner.  We chose to eat in because the restaurant was too far to get carry out or delivery to our home. There are 2 booths and 2 tables, so enough room for about 12-15 people to eat in.   The staff was all very friendly, and accommodating to special requests, seems to be a family operation possibly.  We ordered a large pepperoni, and a small pierogi pizza. Both were cooked well and tasted great. I will say that just the nature of pierogi is not a big flavor, so it was good, but I don't think I'll order it again because I like a bigger flavor profile for my pizza.  Another quick note is that I loved the many flavors of Turner Ice Tea they carried. I tried Lime for the first time, and really enjoyed it!"}
