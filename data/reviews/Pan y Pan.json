{"text":"Went to Pan y Pan for the first time with my Son.  As English speakers we were accommadated.  The service was amazing.  The food was very authentic, very different from the chain Mexican Restaurants out there. The owners family was there and I met them and even got to hold the 2 month old baby.  They made us feel so welcome."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch was delicious had the flat bean stuffed open face sandwich with pork .yummy"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars because the staff was extremely friendly and I was impressed by the authenticity of the menu and the speediness of the service however when the food arrived the Posole was very bland and the queso tasted like something that came out of a jar. I am going to come back another to try something else on the menu to see if I can improve this rating"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I just had the best enchiladas of my life at this small restaurant on Madison's East side.  I definitely recommend you give it a try.  The service was good, the food tasty, timely, and hot, and the price was just a bit right, if a bit low for the value provided. Thank you, Pan & Pan for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"PROS: Interesting Mexican bakery CONS: Hole-in-the-wall style  The baked goods here seem pretty authentic, not that I would know. The space is small, homey, and feels very real. They have different chocolate, cheese, and strawberry jam filled breads. I was not a big fan of the  flan or puddings but the pastries were pretty good. Nothing fancy, but reminded me of Chinese bakeries."}
{"text":"this restaurant gets 5 stars from me! service is extremely quick, even when abundantly crowded and the pancakes are great!"}
