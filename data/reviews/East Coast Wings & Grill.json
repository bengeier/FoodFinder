{"text":"Monday night here is the best if you like wings!! .59 cent wings but be careful the flavors are extra but they have over 75 different flavors!!"}
{"text":"ECW has the absolute best wings, and it's one of the few places that you can get Red Oak beer in this area. We eat here a lot and the food and service are consistently excellent.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I placed and order recently for an event that I was having at my home. Shame on me for not checking my order before I left. I came home and sat the bags down and I had someone help me with the set up. People started eating before I noticed that I had the wrong order. In my experience if you call a restaurant they offer to replace the order immediately if you can return for the pickup or they will comp you a meal by taking your name down or sending out a small gift card for later use. NOT EAST COAST WINGS!!!! I spoke the manager and he offered to replace the meal but only if I could return the food that I picked up in error. I tried to explain to him that I was not in a position to return the food because I was hosting an event and honestly a couple of wings had gotten eaten by mistake before I realized my order was not correct. He told me he could do nothing to correct the issue if I couldn't bring the food back. He said to save the food until I could bring it back in. So the customer service is horrible. Maybe they have a lot of people trying to get over and get free food, but that was not my case. If I place an order and the receipt is correct but the order is wrong how is that my fault? Why should the customer be totally inconvenienced! I understand that things happen but the way this issues was handled has left my in utter shock! Never have I had something like this happen. So if you are going to place a take out order PLEASE take time and check your order before you leave and drive away."}
{"text":"I only visit this East Coast Wings location and have always been impressed with the cleanliness of the dining area and restrooms.  

The number of unique wing flavors is impressive and the ability to modify the heat index of each means it would be nearly impossible to not have a favorite!

Patio seating is nice for dinner, the arrangement of buildings helps keep the sun from blinding guests seated facing west."}
{"text":"Worse place for wings or service.  The servers steal from you and the kitchen serves greasy cold food. Will never come back. Management is rude and laugh in your face.  They have no care about their customers."}
{"text":"Poor service and extremely slow. Lousy atmosphere. Buffalo Wild Wings is just across the street."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not very good service. I asked before I ordered if they could sub avocado for the cheese in my wrap. The waitress said yes but then did not place the order correctly. We ordered a sampler appetizer and they sent out the pita chips with no hummus....substituted French fries. When they brought my wrap back out...correctly...they did not bring one of the items that was supposed to come with it, according to their menu. We ordered takeout as well for the next day....25 wings. When she brought them out packaged to go she then asked usl if we wanted the celery that was to come with it. At this point we just said no thanks and left."}
{"text":"This place was great, I ordered pick up and it was AMAZING. The food was great! I had the Philly cheese steak, it was cooked perfectly and tasted great. When I went to pick up the food though, I did have to wait a while though, there were so many people in the front, people that were waiting to be seated, it was really busy. What good food place isn't crowded though?! It was pretty good overall ."}
{"text":"Great wings and great service.  I didn't really like the chips but the wings made up for it."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times. Service is always great. Love the selection of wing sauces and beer."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! The food itself really isn't the issue. I have been to east coast wings in other cities and the food is decent. I moved here a year ago and we had our first experience here. The service was awful!! It took 15-20 minutes just for the server to come and take our drink order. They brought the wrong food for my date and when we said something they argued with us that it was what we ordered. I decided that maybe it was a bad night for them and a couple months later went back to order food for take out. It took 45 minutes and when I asked the girl where my food was it had been sitting behind the bar for 20 minutes and they just forgot about it!! Insane! They seriously need to reevaluate their staff and obviously management if they haven't caught on."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place last night about 8:45 and told there was a 10-15 minute wait; not a problem so we gave our name and proceeded to wait. We counted and there were 4 parties in front of us. People were leaving steadily and all of those parties in front of us were seated. By this time it had been about an 45 min wait and there was a table in the back that was clean and no one was acknowledging us. My husband inquired with the manager that we were told 10 minute wait when we got there which was now 45 min and an empty table had been available for at least 10 min. The manager said we shouldn't have been told only 10 minutes and they were cleaning tables as fast as the could. In the meantime another party came in(2 people) and was taken to the empty table right off the bat. When my husband asked the hostess why they were seated after just walking in he was told on the weekend that that table was only for parties of 7 or more and we were 2, but we saw 2 people so I would assume more were coming but they weren't there yet. Well I understand that and it makes sense but NOT when someone has waited close to an hour already. They should have had sense enough to make an exception especially since the majority of the patrons in the restaurant were winding down their meals and there would have been plenty of tables. Oh and I forgot to mention one of the waitresses had friends come in after us and she sat them outside and waited on them. They only got drinks and some type of dessert but still we waited. This was our first visit to this place so needless to say our first impression was a lasting one. We ended up walking out."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time yesterday. I got a burger which wasn't very good. The review above about it being precooked might be accurate because the burger was dry like it had been precooked or sitting out all day. If you're craving a burger I'd suggest going 100ft across the parking lot to Five Guys. They had a few craft beers which were decent and a great price ($3.50 for mine). If I go back, I will try the wings and update my review."}
{"text":"Some of the best shrimp tacos that I've had!!!The shells were warm and soft and the bbq sauce on them was fabulous!!! (Mine were grilled.) The service was great, as well. Even though they were very busy and it took a while to get our food, our drinks never got low  and we didn't mind waiting. Our server was great about checking in on us and had a great personality. The sides were fair. Our handmade chips were not crisp, and the fries at the bottom of the basket were sitting in a puddle of grease. But overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out this place right by my house!  Turned out to be awesome!  So many different flavours of wings to choose from.  We ended up getting the Jamaican Jerk and medium buffalo.  I loved the jerk wings the best!  Always a good choice.  I ordered something different for  myself to try something new.  I got the Cali Wrap Pannini.  Very good!  Comes with a creamy guacamole sauce!  And the fries were hot and crispy.  We will dfinitly be going back to try other things and I know there will be some wings to go on the weekends."}
{"text":"When business name says \"Wings\" in it, you'd expect great wings. The wings are average at best."}
{"text":"Average wings with a wide variety of flavors.

Like most wing joints they carry a dizzying amount of flavors.  I have not tried them all but the ones I have eaten were good enough to enjoy.  They have more options than wings so the variety Is good.  The staff that served us were friendly and the food came out fast and hot.  It's nothing to write home about but if you want wings it'll do the job."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good wings, good service, low wait times, good prices!"}
{"text":"You have to try the Santa Fe Quesadilla. I don't usually enjoy quesadillas but decided to give it a try per recommendation from one of the waitress. It has a very rich taste to it. If  chicken and flavor is your thing, you'll love this quesadilla. The beer is also pretty cheap and they have a variety of wings and other food you can choose from. The local beer, No Shame, is also pretty good if you like PBR."}
{"text":"Waited for 1 hr, 15 mins for a table, after we finally got seated, had to go find a person to take our order. Mgr never once came to table to apologize for the wait or to see how the food was. Definitely would not recommend this place, food was ok but for the service & wait, much better elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Wings were nice and cooked well. However sauce on the wings is an additional $1 per 5pcs. Corporate bait and switch crap makes me mad. The Iron City Burger is nothing like the picture, I was sooo disappointed. Again corporate bait and switch.  I expect this from fast food, but not a sit down restaurant.  I guess you need to ask a lot of questions before you order...."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting an East Coast Wings location, and will be our last. Our visit was at about 5:30pm... Early for dinner but we were starving. 
Our server was very superficial in her friendliness, and that is practically a sin here in North Carolina. 
My wife ordered wings, and so got carrots as a complementary side. They were way past their prime - soggy and tasted near rotten. 
I ordered the local OMB beer - how can it be anything but fresh and tasty? It was flat and sour. I ordered the fish and chips - the fish was small little chunks that were more batter than fish. My wife's wings had an alright flavor on the outside, but tasteless inside. They were sitting in a pool of grease. No side dish or bowl was provided to put the leftover bones.  And what's with adding $0.99 for flavor? I can understand when you want multiple flavors. But we only got one... Who would order wings with NO flavor?

We ate the food because we were quite hungry, but we won't be settling for this food again."}
{"text":"OMG best food ever. The menu has so much to choose from, there is something for everyone. I would definitely recommend trying the wings my favorite were teriyaki ginger. Yummy"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. Just wish they were closer to where we live in Concord. We love the regular wings, the boneless wings and the homemade chips. Service has always been great. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I haven't had great wings like this in a long time. They were cooked to perfection. The sauce was plentiful!!! I tried the volcanic wings, ranch wings and general tso's wings. The variety of wings is endless. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I got there around 6pm on a Friday. It gets crowded pretty quick so the service will differ. I had excellent service. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Hit this place on their 2nd day and we loved it. The waiter helped with my decision for wing sauce (Kentucky Bourbon) and I already can't wait to go back. We also had shrimp tacos and a buffalo chicken wrap. Sure wish I would have added the same wing sauce to the wrap but it was still wonderful. The menu is huge and it will take you forever to decide, unless you're just seeking wings.. then it's the 75 different sauces you need to select from. We started with the Fiesta Feta and knew from the first taste this place would get in our list of favorite places. Keep in mind that kids eat free on Wednesdays but the place is split up to handle it if you're not wanting a noisy night out. ;)  They have TVs hung all over for those that cannot eat without a TV in sight and plenty of parking.  They sit just in front of REI in the Target parking lot. Easy access from I-77 or I-485 if youre on the road and more fun/choices than typical road stops."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. Multiple servers passed by our table with none offering to help us. We were seated and waited for about 15 minutes. We asked for help from a server walking by, he said that our server would be by shortly. After 15 minutes of waiting, it was clear that they were not interested in taking our orders. So we left."}
{"text":"Another great visit to East Coast Wings. Ordered the pub pretzels appetizer with cheese dip. Loved by all in the family. 
Choose five different sauces with the 25 boneless wings platter. All were good. 

Service was fast and our wings were excellent. Fun place to take the whole family or group of friends b"}
{"text":"Our family loves the wings and many sauces at East Coast Wings! The wing flavors are all delish, but our favorites are chipotle ranch, sweet BBQ, buffalo, coconut mango, and garlic. We have a large family that loves ranch on everything and the one thing we noticed was that at every table, they provide you with 3 huge bottles of ranch for your veggies, wings and fries. This is free unlike other wing restaurants that charge you for every teeny tiny serving of ranch. This is so great because you don't feel like you're being nickeled and dimed. 

Also, the basket of fries are very large and 4 people could easily not get through them all. The best option on the menu to order the sampler because you can get a lot of wings (boneless and regular) for a big group. Just add a basket of fries for each group of 4 people to share. Again, this is a great place for wings and their sauces and service can't be beat!

*My review is missing the 5th star because there is only 1 large table that can accommodate our family or a large group, which means you have to wait a while on a busy night. That's the only downside we've experienced."}
{"text":"This was our first time at any East Coast Wings franchise.  The Harrisburg restaurant just opened recently so when we went on a Friday evening and it of course was very crowded with a 45 min wait to be seated.  We decided to just put in an order to go.   We ordered 25 in bone wings in 5 different flavors and a basket of fries.  The restaurant itself looked nice, if not a little small.  The host staff was pleasant and professional despite being very busy.  The have a pretty large menu with huge variety in wing flavors to choose from.  Our food was prepared to go in a reasonable time frame.  Our food was packaged in styrofoam containers with the individual wing flavors separated by foil and the flavors written in sharpie on the outside of the container to show the location of each flavor.  Now for the food.  The quality of the wings themselves was very good.  Large wings with plenty of meat.  The first issue we had was one of the flavors we purchased was mild buffalo and they totally forgot to put any sause on them.  They were naked wings.  The other 4 flavors we got had flavoring but all 4 had muted flavors that really did not match the description.  The fries were just awful...Too salty and soggy.  Our expectations were based on what we are used to at Buffalo Wild Wings were we go frquently.  East Coast wings based in our one and only experience fails in comparison.  BWW flavors no matter what flavor you get are very flavorful and true to the description.  The sides are good as well at BWW.  The prices are about the same although the wing special price nights are lower at BWW.  The distance from our house is pretty close to both so that is a wash.  Overall there is no reason for me to take my family to East Coast wings instead of BWW... BWW is just better!  Except for the wet naps...East Coast wings has superior were naps!!"}
{"text":"Love the wings here; they have the best flavors and combinations. They are a little $$$, but you're paying for quality."}
{"text":"This is a noisy and cramped location.  The service staff is hurried, not well trained and overall not a good option!  The cocktails are served in VERY small glasses and we had to send our first ones back because they made the wrong.  Don't recommend this location at all.  Reward another restaurant with your dinning dollars."}
{"text":"Terrible service, came in for supper around 8:50, were seated in a timely manner.  Sat for 10 mins waitresses were waiting on tables all around us, a group of three was seated after us their drink orders were taken.  We continued to wait for 10 mins tried waving down a waitress,  finally we said screw it and got up and left.  The \"manager\"who was standing there the whole time told us to have a good night on our way out.  This isn't the first time service was slow at this location but will be the last time we try and eat here, they have lost out on our business.  All other ECW seem to have it together not sure what the deal is here."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday at the restaurant at Northlake. The place looks a little tired, the cushions in booth we sat at were in pretty bad shape. They were cracked and needed to be replaced. I would give 5 stars for the craft beer selection, I would give 5 stars for the wings, and I would give 4 stars for our waitress Morgan. Overall everything was great, except for the nickle and dime charges on the bill. I ordered the wing lunch special (5 wings and a side for $7.99) There was an additional .99 cent charge for the wings I ordered (Gen. Tso), There was an additional .99 cent charge for ordering Brussel Sprouts on the side. There was an additional .99 cent charge for bleu cheese dressing, which the waitress asked if I wanted. There was no mention of additional charges for the three items, which I felt were petty and unnecessary. This would have been a 5 star review, except for the petty up charges."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with discounts on there craft beers on a Saturday... win win

Lindsey was our server and took great care of us.. thank you Lindsey for doing such  a great job and putting up with my witty personality"}
{"text":"I'll give ECWG four stars because it is, after all, a chain. That said, they do have good food. We've been to the Northlake location twice and ordered the fried mushrooms both times. They are served hot with a tasty dipping sauce (Lava Ranch). We had wings on the first visit. The Chesapeake flavor was excellent. Last visit, we got the mixed Buffalahitas with steak, chicken, and shrimp with the Chesapeake seasoning. The meats came in a bowl with black beans, rice, grilled red and green peppers, and grilled onions. It turned out to be a spicy Creole delight that was very tasty and more than we could eat. We'll be back next time we're in the area and it's eatin' time."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time and was surprised at how nice the experience was. The food was great, even though I didn't finish it all and our server, Paul B was great and not to mention easy on the eyes. I will definitely be returning when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Really good wings! They have drink specials during the week, not to mention their half priced appetizers from 3:30-6pm and 9pm-Close, and kids eat free on Wednesdays. Always a great experience at East Coast Wings. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We got here fairly late at night and the place was still packed. We were lucky and snuck some seats at the bar. Great and really expansive menu. Tons of wings to choose from and it was nice to be able to eat at a less corporate type place since Northlake is full of corporations. I feel like this may become a regular haunt for the fella and I."}
{"text":"Great wings... great staff... This is not a fast food dive..so don't go and expect to be done in 20 min. Enjoy the food and time with friends! Did I mention the great wings?"}
{"text":"Service was great first of all. The food was very filling and tasted good. My coworker loved his martinis. Only complaint was it is chilly in the building. I don't mind ac, but that was a bit nippy. Keep up the great food/service though."}
{"text":"Go to buffalo wild wings.  It is right across the street.

Food at bww is better, similar drink specials, and more fun.

This isn't a bad place, just not as good as other sports bars near by."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is nice. Love the wings and the amount of sauces to pick from. Just tried the Golden BBQ and it's amazing. Burgers are big and fries are crispy and delicious.  Definitely my favorite wings place!"}
{"text":"East coast started out great, unfortunately, like a lot of other places, it has gone downhill.  My weekly men's group has been meeting at east field for about a year.  Tuesday nights are our normal meeting night and they have beer specials that night.  It is hard to beat three dollar craft beer pints.  While the menu has a good selection the actual taps may tell another story.  On more than one occasion our favorite has been out.

The food is usually decent.  The wings are meaty and taste good but they can be a bit heavy with the sauce so be careful.  They also charge you for the sauce selection per order which can add up.  Join their food club if you go often as for every one hundred you spend you get five dollars off.  Just make sure your waitress runs the club card as I have had to remind them more than once.

This place was great and is still good, just can't really overwhelming give it thumbs up due to too many missing products and just excuses by management and wait staff.  Go for the cheap beer on Tuesdays, hopefully they keep that tradition."}
{"text":"Great place for wings.  We ordered a variety of wings and salads.  All very good!!  Parking is in the mall area....so was OK.  The location did not seem very busy and our waitress was very attentive.  Only thing I would have changed.... a little faster delivery of the wings!  Maybe my hunger drove my impatience.  But I am certainly anxious to return!!!!  Maybe today!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here and it was awesome! We are from California and had a layover and wanted? to explore the area. We are glad we eat here, great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food great staff this place know wings. Tons of flavors to choose from and everything I've tried is great. I'll be back for sure TRY THE RANCH WINGS!!!!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience.... Except once when they entirely ran out of chicken and the manager wouldn't give any sort of discount I mean who does that?!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome experience for a casual wings and burger place. Kid friendly. Came on Saturday night. Didn't have to wait for a table. Drinks, including draft beer, came lightning fast, as did our appetizers. Wings were great, as was the ranch dressing! Meals came just as quickly. Everything was very good, especially the fries. Service was friendly and attentive. Happy to have such a good meal after a long day of driving from Florida. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for wings and beer!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location maybe 4x's  this last experience was disappointing. I normally order boneless wings w/mixed berry (delish) & mild buffalo sauce. Mild normally has a lil kick to it not too much. This time I order the usual & the buffalo sauce was pure butter w/ a dab of hot sauce for color DISGUSTING !!!! Spoke w/ manager Sam whom was very sarcastic w/ a dnt care attitude told him I always order mild it has NEVER tasted like pure butter. Advised Sam . I live 20 min away he wanted me to drive back for 5 wings in order to have them replaced... instead of offering to replace them with my next visit or when in area. Sam definitely needs to find another career path management is clearly not it"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and experience.
They have a great selection of flavors and we had the 25 flight with 5 variations of sauces.
I would give five stars if the prices were a bit more affordable and we could eat here more often. Being in college we try to stretch the money to the end of the month..."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Wings are big, the sauce is just right. man this is a great place to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"Loving the new building good food lots of daily specials, and a great choice of beverages! Bottomless chips awesome and Thursday is .65 cent boneless wings. Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were referred to this place. We went on a Monday afternoon & they weren't too busy. However we had to seat ourselves because the waitress/ host were hundred in a corner and just stared at us without making any type of comment. Food came out pretty fast, but was not tasty. The regular fries tasted sweet not to mention our server handling our food with bare hands. We could see this from another server who had the kitchen door open. 
I will not eat hear again."}
{"text":"Franchise restaurant that this location pulls off great. Quick and friendly wait staff the couple times I have been to eat here, and the take out is quick too. I personally like the east coast wings flavors better then the other franchise wing joints, so if your familiar with East Coast wings and like their food, I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Good wing flavors. And decent draft specials, but will probably never go again. Went in for my 4th or 5th time there and got completely denied by the bartender (and then manager) because they don't accept out of state licenses. (I'm from Georgia.) Then the manager accused my ID of being fake, which I can assure is not. As much as I hate to admit it, I am over 21 years of age. :(

We ended up just leaving and going to Fox and Hound across the street. (They accepted my Georgia license just fine.) Now that I think about it, East Coast probably didn't want to serve me and my friend? We were the only guests in there and they were going to close in an hour.

How can you be located right off of I-77 and not accept out of state licenses? And then on top of that, not have your managers up to date on other states' licenses? I thought this place was nice and was hoping they stick would around... C'mon guys, what happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"Its a wing chain with WAAAAY too many choices on wings sauces.

I went in for lunch today and it was pretty good.  My server Carson was extremely attentive and will ask for her by name in the future.  The lunch specials are reasonably priced and definitely enough food.

I went back and forth on what I wanted, it was going to be the grilled chicken salad but, once I saw buffalo chicken soup, I had to try it.  I went soup and turkey sandwich, while my cohort went chicken tenders and side salad.  Her salad was pretty basic and the tenders were HUGE, crunchy, and quite tasty.  The bluecheese dressing was borderline horrible.  My turkey sandwich was strange.  Cole slaw on a turkey sandwich?  It wasn't bad it just wasn't good.  My soup came out as well and there wasn't anything buffalo about it.  It was chicken tortilla soup.  I asked my server if she got it wrong and she said no, but offered me some bufalo sauce for it.  The soup was pretty good as is but, came out great once I added the sauce.  I guess they should call it, make your own buffalo chicken soup, LOL!

We thought we were ready for the check when our server Carson came back with an awesome sounding desert.  Pineapple cake with ice cream.  Although it took a while and I didn't really have much time to spare during lunch, the desert was good.

All in all, I'd give my food 2-3 stars, my partners 3-4 stars, and the service, 5 stars.  I've been to these places before and had better food, so I'll be back and hope to upgrade my star rating."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at East Coast wings on kids eat free night off and on for over a year. The location, management and food have been both professional and practical for our after school activities. We visited East Wings Northlake Charlotte this past week for the first time this summer to find a number of changes. The management has placed a monetary cap on the adult food purchases in order for a child's meal to be comp. i ordered wings for my self and a child's tenders and I was told I had not ordered enough food for child's meal to be free. Now my child's meal normally would cost 4.99 and the basket of fries or side salad would have cost me between 4.50 and 5.29. So, exactly where is the savings. I have never heard of such....it was like being at the comedy club with a 3 drink minimum and the drinks cost 10 dollars each. The food is still good here but I'm not sure what is going on with the management at this location. It looks like we will probably take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Its not your normal buffalo wings, but still 75 great flavors to choose from.  For some reason they don't tell you what each flavor means, you have to ask for the cheat sheet.  Its kinda complicated when there is Bahama Mama, Caribbean, Hey Mon, polynesian, key west, Maui ect....  Good wings, great daily specials, and friendly service.  Bourbon street seems to be a good flavor to try."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the fried pickle spears and the blue cheese flavored hot wings.  Great service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant. So many delicious flavors of wings and much more. Our personal favorite is the endless chip basket. They always give you plenty of food and the wait staff is awesome. Bailey is our favorite! 

Note.... the restaurant is a smaller restaurant so on a busy night expect to wait or go early. 

Monday is wing night (65 cents), Wednesday is kids night, and Thursday is boneless wings (65 cents) and $4 22 ounce  domestic drafts."}
{"text":"It's very good I love the sauces went with my grandson and he loved it the staff is nice but not very smart we asked for extra napkins but they only gave us 2 I would recommend the medium mild is to flavorless"}
{"text":"I like eating here and the prices are very reasonable. The service is good and your food comes out very quickly. The only problem that I have had is that when they are busy there can be a bit of a long wait time. This is not necessarily their fault though so don't let it discourage you from going! My favorite thing to get is their boneless Teriyaki Ginger wings. The food can be a bit greasy but I think that comes with the territory. To avoid grease, go for the chilli but make sure to be prepared to take some home!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch after a school field trip. We were greeted by a hostess upon entering the restaurant. As we sat down we were brought our menus by the waitress. Our orders were taken and then that is where it went downhill from there. We waited almost an hour to get our food. The waitress was also not very attentive. The restaurant was clean though and the bathrooms were clean as well. The food was great so I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"We tried ECW twice and both times we were happy with our experience.  It's a great edition to Harrisburg. 

The first time we went there was an hour wait on a Friday night, so we were clearly not the only people excited that ECW was here.  We sat at a table and both the food and the service were great.  I love all the wing sauce options and combos and I love that you can try every flavor and add heat to each one.

The second time we went we sat at the bar, and while there wasn't a wait, the restaurant was packed.  The bartender took great care of us.  They were even very accommodating when we moved to a table in the bar area after we ate when other family showed up.

We've been known to pick our dinner options over craft beer options (ok, ok...craft beer options is the leading factor in decided where to go) and they have great choices.  They have a great variety of local beer and about 8 - 10 taps.  

Everything we ate was great.  I can't wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and owner that doesn't even care! Took my husband there for his birthday. After a long wait in an empty restaurant they brought out the wrong wings, the ones that were right were cold. We had no napkins or wipes (pretty basic necessity for a wing place) After waiting 25 mins to talk to the owner who was apparently \"on the phone\" he appears unapologetic or even sympathetic and was just a downright @$$! Thanks for ruining my husband's birthday!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the wings, especially with the drunken apple sauce. I am giving them 3 stars because I rarely ever get good service at this location. They have a whole bunch of high school students working who all need to be fired. They answer the phones and have poor phone etiquette, you walk in for a table and they rarely address you first. They do more leaning than cleaning. The food is the only reason I still eat here."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Once tasty, the wings now  taste if they were pre-made.  Just not as good. Also not worth the 65 cents Monday special  if you are going to charge a dollar per flavor. Why not after 2 flavors the surcharge. Oh well, may not return  BWW has better deals."}
{"text":"Just to let you know that, they charge $0.99 per flavor.  I like to have different flavors when I make a large order.  I sorry ECW.....but I don't like these hidden charges."}
{"text":"My bf and I go to this east coast ALL the time. This time I ordered a veggie patty but instead was served turkey. I didn't realize it was turkey because of the amount of toppings on it. I ate the whole sandwich and got the bill to notice it was a turkey burger. Asked for confirmation and the waitress said she would ask what I was served then the manager came out and said he remembered her telling him it was changed to veggie. Yeah right then why didn't she recall that. Have been a vegetarian for a long time and completely hurt by this situation. If I could give this review 0 stars I would. they did refund the sandwich which was fine but they should have waitresses write down the order instead of memorizing it. would have saved a lot of grief for me. will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Nice little go to for wings and fries. The choice for sauces were excellent. Affordable and filling."}
{"text":"Great boneless wings.  Tender, not dry.  The beer battered fries are real good too.  Will be back."}
{"text":"It's okay. I've gotten the wings and the fajitas before. Pretty good. They have a lot of different wing sauces. Parking can be tricky if on a crowded night."}
{"text":"Great wings... Awesome and creative flavors.  There are so many fun flavors to choose from ....locals must have a blast getting to try them all."}
{"text":"Wings are hit or miss but the chips are always delicious. I usually sit at the bar and the bartenders are always lovely."}
{"text":"Usually don't have any issues coming here but lately service hasn't been great.  Employees don't seem to like their job and it shows in their service."}
{"text":"The staff is great the wings are awesome and big ones to and all them flavors wow .
I'm new to this yelp thing but you gotta try this place out . Cold Beer and many kinds of them not your plain bud, Miller."}
{"text":"Soon after I found out there was a new wing joint semi-nearby, I made a point to get over and try this place out. Afterwards, I feel I really don't have a strong opinion either way. I will say there is appeal to the venue itself- outdoor seating, full bar, etc. and it's nestled in a not-so-congested area. 

The food (and I mean their wings here) is just simply lack-luster when you compare it to a Buffalo Wild Wing or Wild Wing Café. Great selection of sauces, but I think the flavors are just too bland/ no kick. Empty calories. You may be better off ordering a sandwich here.

The prices in general are somewhat modest. Fairly good service, could've been a little quicker, but at least friendly. Overall ok."}
{"text":"We normally stop at the location in Kannapolis, but thought we'd try this one. Honestly, upon first entering we didn't feel like we received much of a welcome greeting so we felt doubtful. As it turned out a waiter was very nice and attentive, so that helped to win us back.

We each had a half dozen wings which were well cooked, nice & crispy, but drowning a bit in sauce even though we asked that they not be. The homemade chips were crisp and delicious.

It is kind of a low light atmosphere, even though we were there in the middle of the afternoon on a very sunny day. All in all, an ok experience."}
{"text":"Great location that's easy to get to, right off I-85 at exit 60.  Staff is super friendly.  The wings are a good size, super crispy and a huge selection of flavors in any level of heat - excellent!"}
{"text":"I went to ECW tonight.  I attempted to call the order in but was on hold for over 15 minutes.  Since my son really wanted the food here, I drove here to place the order and pick up the food.  Upon arrival there were several people waiting at the door and to place and pick up orders.  I spoke with JD who was one of the managers on duty.  He stated they were really busy because of the game.  I simply informed him that I called to place an order and was on hold for over 15 minutes.  He told me \" they are not a call center\" and that if I know there is some type of sporting event that I should order online.  Well..... I follow sports, I know it's March Madness.....had I been told by the person who answered the phone that they were busy and my best option would be to place the order online then that's what I would have done.  The manager rolled his eyes at me and walked away.  JD mentioned over five excuses as to why they had me on hold for so long.....but what he never said was I'm sorry this happened.   Very poor customer service the past two times here.  Sad, because the food is usually pretty good.    My suggestion would be....if you know there is an event that would cause you to be busy, Staff Up Son."}
{"text":"I was so glad to find an East Coast Wings when I moved to the QC from Statesville, it was like a little piece of home was with me even though this location is in Northlake and I live on the East Side it's worth the drive for the quality and taste of the food!

My favorite are the fried pickles, and unlike most places they fry theirs in spears. I'm a sucker for restaurants with good ranch dressing and East Coast serves some of the BEST with their fried pickles. 

They have a large bar area for those looking to drink and watch the game, which seems to be second nature to Charlotteans, so if you're looking for a quiet place to dine or take a date this isn't it!

They do have wing specials on Mondays and Thursday's and serve the BEST Texas toast alongside them. They have a heat index and flavors available for those that like a little something extra on their wings. 

Definitely my go to place when I want good quality wings!"}
{"text":"Since the East Coast Wings in Mooresville is now closed (and others I've heard) I was pleased to find this franchise in Charlotte on a day trip there recently.  In fact, I ended up here twice within a week on a second trip.  East Coast continually has the meatiest, biggest, and juiciest wings of anywhere around.  Even at the other franchise locations, I have rarely been disappointed.  At this location, I have had two wonderful back to back experiences with great servers and great food both times.  My only wish for East Coast is that they bring back the \"Chesapeake\" Flavor.  The menu is not the same without it.  Still, you can't go wrong for wings here.  It's a little bit pricier than the average wing joint, but worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! My regular wing place used to be Buffalo Wild Wings but this wing place has a lot more flavors to choose from!
Everytime I come here I get the 25-wing option and get 5 flavors that I haven't tried before. My favorite is probably Grande Cayman.
I also get fries, which also come with several different flavors (like Sour Cream and Onion)!
Would definitely recommend this to people that love a wide variety of wing flavors."}
{"text":"We love East Coast Wings! Always great service and nice casual atmosphere. I love the many choices and flavors of wings and different heat index. Have also had their Philly cheese steak and fried pickles. Good food at decent prices."}
{"text":"I love lemon pepper wings, they're pretty simple to make and I've found that if you make a good lemon pepper, the rest of the wings are usually pretty good.  I grade wing spots based on their preparation of the lemon pepper wing, that being said any wing spot that can't do a decent lemon pepper rub is just not worth a repeat visit.  East Coast prepared my lemon pepper wings drowned in butter.......which is fine, but I asked before ordering if the rub was wet or dry.....they weren't terrible but I'd rather not have buttery wings.  I also ordered a salad which was just ok."}
{"text":"We love this place. So glad we have it in Harrisburg. The beer cheese dip with the fries is amazing. Love the wing flight. Great flavors!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated right away. Server was very knowledgeable & she helped us through the wing ordering options. The Fiesty Feta w/Pita chips is DELISH! The wings are crispy, juicy, and seasoned to perfection.  The Mushroom Swiss Burger had great taste of the grill with fresh crisp lettuce & plump tomatoes & mushrooms. They even have a rewards card & will send u coupons and freebies for your bday. Prices are reasonable and average. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The wings were just okay. They have a very large variety of sauces, literally about 50, to choose from. In my opinion, the wings were small. They weren't soggy, but they weren't crispy either. Very average, but decent overall."}
{"text":"Each time I go here I am never disappointed. There was an occasion where I ventured away from the wings and got a turkey burger (not my favorite), but I usually stick to what the eatery specializes in. So thus far, no order of chicken wings have let me down. Try the kamikaze wings and pub pretzels with the beer ale cheese Also the carnival fries and fried pickles I think are good too."}
{"text":"Popular place for wings, ribs and such. Often have to wait for a table but food is good and plenty of TVs for watching sports. Huge selection of wing sauces and heat ranges."}
{"text":"This experience was an interesting one to say the least. When our party of five arrived, we were not greeted by a hostess, but a waitress walking by saw us and called a hostess over to get us a table. I noticed he selected a table with an X through it on reference page they use for placing guests and seated us. We then waited for 10-12 minutes before stopping a server named Gina to get us some water. She was apologetic and got us waters. I then decided to wash my hands and speak with the manager on duty. I waited for him at the hostess stand and he was kind enough to come out and speak with me. I explained to him that one of the ladies in my party is getting married very soon and that we were working to make it a great experience and we decided to break in is restaurant because she enjoys their food and service. I shared with him that she had documented the wait on her phone and asked him to ensure the rest of our visit would be great. He apologized and assured me that me that he would. We ended up getting our food and our orders did not come out correctly, one at our table did not receive her meal until we had almost finished eating and it to was not correct. Our wings were not cooked to perfection, some were overcooked and some were lacking in flavor. The fries were hot and very good and so was the blue cheese. After the symphony of errors, Gina was nice enough to bring out a free dessert. I do believe she was the only redeeming quality about the service. I would implore the management team of this location to consider the infrastructure of their training as it pertains to professionalism and propriety of their teams. We saw staff members standing around talking, joking loudly and not focused on their guests. I would also ask they consider being sincere when speaking with a guest about their experience. It would have made all the difference for my friend. If you are looking for a quick drink and not focused on great service, this is the place for you. If you want a great Friday night dinner experience, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's comparable to Buffalo Wild Wings but better because of the variety of the menu and the flavor selections available for your wings. You chose how many you want, bone in or bone out, flavor and heat level. So your wings are totally customizable. They have an entire menu page of flavors. I've tried about 7 of the 30 they have. Great atmosphere and great drinks."}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times before and it was always good and fair . Today I call in an order for the $0.65 wing special . I ask the girl on the phone if that really was the special . She said \" yes sir , $0.65 per wing , bone in or bone out\" . So I order 20 . I get there and to my surprise they charged me $1 for sauce per 10 wings , $0.75 per cup of ranch and $0.75 for celery. It was $20 for what I was expecting to be $13+Tx . Mind you , if you order off the regular menu they don't nickel and dime you like that . I think it actually cost me more to get the special .Very disappointed customer . Gave em 2 stars because the food was still good 

TL/DR- Specials aren't very special , lots of fine print .

PS. This is the first non 5 star review I have ever left on Yelp ...."}
{"text":"First time here. Waitstaff was very friendly and helpful with navigating the menu and the sauce flavors for the wings as they have so many. The food came out fairly quick and was cooked to our liking. I ordered the chicken philly which was awesome. Fries were my favorite part. Definitely recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. I ordered over the phone and took it to go. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. They offered suggestion that were on point. The food was excellent. The wings are the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing and service was excellent! We had the wings, pretzels, ribs, Mac and cheese and green beans between us......wouldn't change anything!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy ECW for a family dinner or a solo lunch sitting at the bar while out running errands.  The wings are large and meaty and the dry variety is crispy. The lemon pepper is my go to flavor out of the rich and diverse array of flavors.  The wait staff is always nice but I have to share this story from our last trip there...

A very nice member of the staff, who wasn't our waiter, struck up a conversation because he noticed our UNC Chapel Hill sweatshirts and the Tar Heel basketball game was on the TV.  He was very pleasant to speak with and he came back several times to engage with us.  We learned that he had a try out for the UNC basketball team but, since he was not offered a scholarship, chose to go to another school.  We learned that he majored in religion and wanted to be a pastor.  He certainly had the personality and was sincerely engaged in the conversation with us and the kids.  After a nice chat with my son about what he is studying at UNC (physics and applied mathematics) he turned to my daughter.  He correctly guessed her age (14) and asked her where she went to school.  She answered Charlotte Catholic High School...to which he reacted and responded \"so you're a dirty Catholic?\"  She said yes, with a puzzled look on her face.  He quickly widened the scope of his inquiry and asked \"you're all dirty Catholics??\"  At this point, any doubt about what he asked was gone and we simply embraced it and said yes.  His attempt at recovery was \"well, at least you're Christian and that's all He care's about\" to which we agreed.  He then walked away, appearing troubled by his close call with a bunch of \"dirty Catholics\" and we didn't see him again.  

Wow!  Really?  ECW deserves a solid 4+ for the wings, the cold beer, and the usual friendly environment.  This experience was headed for a high score on friendly staff until we were judged and slurred for our religion.  Still giving it the deserved 4 because, well... what would Jesus do?   I'll pray for this young man; that he realizes his goal and becomes a pastor.  And that he preaches the positive messages that unite us all free from the prejudices that he was obviously taught somewhere along the line.  Just don't preach it at East Coast Wings as you never know which of the many \"flavors\" you might be talking to."}
{"text":"Great service from Mandy! Interesting sauces. Lots of good choices beyond wings. Not too loud. Overall a good place to hit after a day at the ballfields."}
{"text":"Good wings, good service.  Huge variety of wings. Not to busy for a Friday night. Will definitely be back. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really top-notch, Jonathan the manager and his team are doing a spectacular job. We had dinner there last night with some friends and it was absolutely fantastic with great service great food and a great environment.  Try the beer flight and one of the dry rub wing selections !"}
{"text":"Very good lemon pepper wings and a large selection of other flavors to choose from!"}
{"text":"Went here after tour of college, great service! The triple dipper appetizer was amazing and my husband and I split 25 wings. We were able to get 5 different kinds of wings all were great, but we loved the Cajun and Caribbean the best. Yummy."}
{"text":"Was told 15-20 minutes on Wednesday night but actually waited 30+. Was admittedly a little frustrated but learned that Wednesday is KIDS night. Our server Bailey did a FANTASTIC job. When I say PERFECT service I mean it was perfect from start to finish. Food was great (for wings), atmosphere was decent with a sports theme, restaurant seemed clean (I hope so since it is new).

Overall a good experience and we would definitely go back... just not on a Wednesday lol."}
{"text":"We always order the 30-wing sampler for $27. Can't beat that deal here. 
We have ONLY gotten wings(take-out) from this place. We always say that we'll try other things on the menu, but the wings are so good and we are on a quest to conquer all 75 sauces! I really like the uniqueness of the sauces ALTHOUGH we had some that tasted very similar. I recommend the dry rub SC&O(sour cream & onion). They are very good!! 
Some people had bad experiences here... oh well that sucks. 

Why not four stars???
THE SERVERS ON THE PHONE CAN HAVE AN ATTITUDE AND SOMETIMES DON'T LABEL THE SAUCES ON THE BOXES!!!! IT'S SO EASY, JUST GRAB A FUCKING MARKER AND WRITE THE NAMES/INITIALS ON THE BOXES!!!!

I still recommend though. Yes, even over B-dubs...."}
{"text":"Large wing selection. Casual atmosphere. Great flavored lemonades. Friendly waitress. Overall a good place for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Appetizers are good- we typically get the sampler plate and everything is great. Definitely enjoy the fries with buffalo seasoning.
The sweet potato fries are good and Chicken tenders..
definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were super excited when we discovered this place was opening in Harrisburg, since we love the locations in Kannapolis and Northlake.  It has not disappointed us. We were there on opening day, and have dined there once more and got takeout at least 3 times.  It literally just opened, so that's saying a lot.  Lol.  The service is not the fastest, but quite frankly, none of the East Coast Wings have quick service.  I am okay with it, because where they lack in speed, they make up for in friendliness and helpfulness.  Plus, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Wings are good but the customer service as stated in several other posts...less than desirable. I ordered for the first time on 59 cent wing Monday and asked for fries. They sold me a basket instead of an individual order and the fries ended up being more than the wings! If they had better service the place might be packed with inside diners and take out customers. If it weren't for the cheapo wings I would not be a returning customer 3/5! Upgrade the service!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid I did not have a stellar experience at this ECW. There were large time gaps between appearances of our waitress. The special was advertised as a coffee porter, which turned out to be a blond beer. I'm pretty sure porters aren't blond - or else she should have been told to specify that. It was decent, but definitely not what I wanted!
The wings - first time I had an issue at an ECW. They came out completely without heat. Someone added the wrong sauce in the kitchen. The waitress then brought a side of Magma to dip them into and add some heat, but still it wasn't as hot as the last couple of times I've done ECW. My friend agreed that the experience here was not as good as usual, compared to the Charlotte location the night before (see my last review)."}
{"text":"ECW consistently purveys the second-best wings I've experienced, at all their locations. This is certainly no different. With a wide variety of flavors that you can pair with a wide variety of heat, the wings are guaranteed to suit anyone's tastes (except vegetarians, but why would they come here?). They're fried up crispy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. One of the 15 wings I ordered was a tad small, but no bones broke, so overall this is truly good quality. The beer selection is a little bit lacking, which is only notable because beer and wings are the perfect pair. I also haven't yet brought myself to eat something other than wings, i.e. the \"grill\" part of the name. If I lived in the area, maybe I would get to the other menu items eventually.
(One star deduction is mostly for rather high prices, but also that beer selection.)"}
{"text":"Ugh one of the best wing spots. I had the traditional mild grande cayman flavor. Ughh to die for. They were soo good and juicy. Had a side order of sweet potatoe waffle fries which is also really good. Service was good as well"}
{"text":"On 8/27/2015 7:11pm we decided to do to East Coast WildWings at NorthLake. Apparently there was a 15 to 20 minute wait with Six/Twelve available table. Well it appears they were saving them for parties up to six that would never come in. Anyway instead of breaking the tables into a two tops and four tops and seating the actual waiting guest they we hoping for bigger parties. Therefore we waited and waited. When we were finally seating the tables were still empty."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I guess I will be back.  I've tried 3 of the 75 different wing flavors so I have a few more to get through.  I like that they have the choice of bone in and boneless.  I also like the plate of carrots or celery they serve with the wings.  And don't forget to ask for the Texas Toast, it's delicious.  

The garden salad tastes like bagged salad.  I think next time, I'll ask for romaine/Caesar Salad lettuce.  Their chips are good and their Mozzarella Sticks are ok.   

Service can be hit or miss.  The night we were there,  it seemed like the \"manager\" was socializing more than helping his employees.  He never checked on us or anyone else around us and our waitress could have used a hand.  They also can clean up a little more around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and was not impressed. They had charged us incorrectly and the avocado on my salad was bland and rubbery. If that had been my first time eating there I wouldn't be back. It was just a blah meal."}
{"text":"So we ordered the 25 wing sampler where you get 5 \"free\" marinates. 

The menu is just too complicated. For example, you pick from a list of 75 on how you would like your wings to be coated.

As for the wings itself, it was hit or miss. Some were perfectly deep fried , others were dry to the point it was unedible.

The Server was nice but overall,  a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Probably will not be back to ECW.  Food was tasteless, and customer service was the worst I've ever experienced!  They forgot part of my order, and it became my fault!  
Not worth my time....worst wings ever!

actually was forced to give a rating, my rating is actually minus (-) 5 stars"}
{"text":"Always great food and drinks. Prices are more than fair and the wings are consistently great. Service is very good! A must stop when you are in the area."}
{"text":"They have some of the best wings I've tried and I've been all over, from D.C. To Chicago to Detroit. Reasonably priced and good sides as well. Good bet selection"}
{"text":"We go here often, especially on Mondays for their wings.  AMAZING flavors, love trying them all.  I'm not giving the location 5 stars because service is decent on a whole, but we've had days were it wasn't that great.  Also, seating could be a little bit better, other wise, love it here and it's a definite recommendation to stop here and get some wings."}
{"text":"Great wings!!! Some of the best I've had since I left Buffalo, NY. My waiter was friendly and polite. The wings were fresh, nicely sized and arrived to the table prompt. I would have snapped a picture but I ate my wings as soon as I saw them. I know where I'll be watching the NBA Finals."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today. It was 59 cent wings day so I tried a boneless and bone in type of wings. The boneless wings were not hot as in the temperature of the meat and the bone in wings were lukewarm. I asked her to take the boneless wings back. They were hotter when they came back but they just reheated the wings I had which made the breading more crunchy. The bone in wings were drenched in sauce but they were decent. They charge you also for your sauce type on your wings. I also had the potato chips but I was not really impressed. They were not seasoned except for the seasoning salt on the outside of them. Some of them were soft. If you like wings, it is not a terrible place but it is not the best. The service was okay.It was pretty mediocre. The girl was nice but did not know the placement of items in the menu. I will give her the benefit of the doubt. My server left and didn't say anything which was unprofessional. I came here for convenience but next time I will drive a little farther for better food."}
{"text":"So as many people know, in Harrisburg we are severely lacking in food choices.  So, this being a newer spot, we have been a few times and will continue to come here, due to a lack of options.  The actual restaurant is very small- they do now have a nice sized patio- but there's only a few tables there to actually use.

There are a TON of wing flavors- I'll give them that!  I'm native to outside Buffalo- so because of that I usually only get the Buffalo flavors, which the hot had great flavor.  Another positive is $5 large drafts on Saturdays.

I had a burger on my last visit (pictured) and what I didn't like about this specifically is everything is an uncharge, even onions and pickles.  It adds up!  The burger was also very greasy.

When more restaurants open in Harrisburg soon, I may visit less, by for now I'll stop in randomly.  I think they need to give us a reason to visit by awesome specials or something like that."}
{"text":"Nope... We've eaten here several times.  The nachos are really not worth the prices. Hardly any meat. Chips were stale. Boneless wings were dreadful as they were like chicken nuggets... Traditional wings are WAY overcooked to the point of shoe leather. The hoagies are minimal on meat as well. I'm glad I've been... I won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"I've literally been to just about EVERY wing joint in Charlotte and this is the best. It took me some painstaking months of searching to make that claim, so if you find a better wing, message me, otherwise just pick one of their millions of sauces and shove some wings in your face."}
{"text":"Great wing joint in Kannapolis! Food specials for the week are Monday's: 75 cent bone in wings, 65 cent boneless wings. Wednesday: kids eat free after 3:30pm. Thursday: 65 cent boneless. 
Drink Specials: Monday: select domestic pints $3
Tuesday: craft pints $4 Wednesday: select domestic bottles $2.50, strong island tea and max lemonade $5.99. Thursday: craft pints $4, glasses of wine $5. Friday: Flavored Margaritas $6. 
I was there on a Wednesday night and it was busy but there was no wait for a table. I started out with a small order of the \"lava petals.\" ( deep fried onion petals basically) it comes with a semi-spicy ranch sauce. Also ordered an order of ten traditional wings, hot, with the Cajun garlic sauce with ranch. Came with a side of carrots and celery. The wings were amazing. The last time I was here I had the kamikaze wings extra-hot. So far I have no complaints at all and plan on coming back to try more flavors when I'm in the area. I like that you can choose any flavor and then pick how spicy you want it. It's a little different than other wings joints in that regard. 

I came back for Monday night wing night. 75 cent bone in wings. Ordered the \"lava petals\" again which were good when I ate them with traditional ranch dressing. I ordered 5 of the kamikaze wings which were amazing and 5 if the new Thai satay wings. They were terrible. They have no flavor and no spice at all even though I ordered them hot.  Service wasn't as good this time. The food came out quickly however, it took a while to get my check at the end and I never even got my water refilled. They only gave me one napkin and we all know that's never enough when you're eating wings. Waitress never came back to the table for me to ask for more. I will say that I don't think the wing night deal is that great because the wings are 75 cents a piece but they charge you a dollar to add sauce to them. Then another 65 cents for a side of ranch dressing. It all adds up. I'll come back again but no need to come in for the wing deal since it's not that great. Basically I got ten wings for a little over ten dollars and that doesn't include the ranch or any type of side."}
{"text":"Love their wings although I prefer Buffalo Wild Wings any day. I do like that they have specials and kids eat free on certain days. I like how they have a balloon guy their as well!"}
{"text":"Great wings!  My favorite flavors are grand cayman and raging ranch.
Friendly service!"}
{"text":"My Current situation.  We have been coming to this location since it was established. THIS VISIT HAS BEEN OUR 1ST OUT OF ALL the visits to make us NEVER want to return. Poor Customer Service, BURNT FOOD, NO REFILLS ON WATER and to top it ALL off was late for work because of our decision to come here for lunch!!! Can you say MAD!! The manager Jason acknowledged the poor quality of food served to us but did not make any corrections. I will follow up with Corporate on this matter with the pics of the food!! Now let me get to work... Had to vent before I did!!

{"text":"SO. MANY. CHOICES. 

My boyfriend had a hankering for wings and picked this spot out for dinner. We went on a Wednesday night around 8pm. It was a little empty, but with no major sporting event going on, that wasn't too surprising. We were seated immediately and began pouring over the LARGE menu. We quickly ordered the Buffalo Chicken Lettuce wraps (as we came hungry!) and then poured over the wing flavors.

You get to choose how many wings you want (increments of 5s), style (boneless, traditional, or mixed), the flavor, and the level of heat! VERY cool to say the least at how custom your order can be. We settled on 10 Medium Heat Garlic Parmesan traditional wings, 10 Medium Heat Kamikaze traditional wings, and 5 Insanity Heat Buffalo wings. The Garlic Parmesan was perfect. Not too garlicky, and so crispy. The Kamikaze wings were equally as amazing. I loved them both! The Insanity wings were INSANE. I basically touched my tongue to one and put it back. SO so so insanely hot. (BUT that's what my boyfriend wanted...boy did he get it!)

Our server Darius was attentive and polite. We had a great experience and can't wait to try new flavors."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had and countless flavor choices. The prices are about the same as any wing places. And the drinks were reasonably priced. The staff was very polite. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Food was great
Bathrooms clean!
Mandy was sweet and quick
Best dining experience in past year
Joey abouchacra"}
{"text":"Very good variety of food sections. The staff was attenative and available. I did not agree with the very small boneless wings compared to other wing type restaurants. I felt cheated with size of my meal."}
{"text":"Zach was Great! & Very attentive!
We Loved the Crispiness of the wings, that most places just can't seem to get right.
We were here very late (past closing) but they were happy to have us stay till we finished, one of the waitresses even serenade us while cleaning up LOL.. It shows the employees really enjoy working there.. Manager was friendly.
All around wonderful experience on a Sunday night! Can't wait to come back.."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, tried 5 different flavors- 3 med & 2 hot. Neither had any hint of heat, very disappointed in the place. I will stick to BWW.
Other than the wings the SW eggrolls were really good."}
{"text":"Opens at noon on Sunday, with a line waiting outside. Why not open at 11, at least during football season?  Seems silly. 

Also, $47.61 for 50 wings to go?  This will be the last time that I order wings here to go.

Also, very disappointed that the lunch menu changed. The new one is not nearly as good as the old."}
{"text":"Not as impressed as I could of been
 Buttery wings. Mixed crowd. I did go late, but it still seemed subpar at best."}
{"text":"We have been excited to try the new East Coast wings. Tonight we decided to do take out knowing it would be packed on a Friday night. When I called in I was put on hold for a few minutes but then gave my order and the woman was semi friendly. She said 20-25 minutes which was good timing. We tried the bourbon honey mustard and sweet and bold BBQ. Both were good. I had the Cobb salad which was delicious. This is a great addition to Harrisburg. It is a lot smaller inside than I expected but they will have a nice patio space when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a lot of flavors for your wings, this is a great place to go. They have 50 plus wing flavors. 

The staff was friendly and nice. They have a two parts: half is the restaurant and the other half is the bar area. 

My family enjoyed the wings and said they was really good. NOW I'm pescatarian (I only eat seafood) I did not have a lot of options only about 3. I got the shrimp tacos which was really good. 

The place can get pretty loud. Our waitress was sweet and nice but I keep asking her to repeat what she was saying because she was more soft spoken and when we was there when there was a party and they was loud."}
{"text":"2nd time eating at this location 1st time eating in, and I've gotta say nothing bad to see here! They were organized and the wait for food wasn't a problem. I had a cobb salad & 5 lemon pepper wings. The wings were good not over seasoned and the cobb was a huge portion. The only negative was that the avocado tasted like it came out of a pack like it does at sams club. Other than that very good experience."}
{"text":"Food is good if you eat in. My husband loves these wings & he stops to get them often. However the take out is never right. check it before you leave or you definitely will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wings are great, they crispy on the outside but not dry!  which is a pet peev of mine.  There are many flavors to choose from, I love the Cajun garlic.  Monday nights are 55 cent wing specials.  This place is located in the Northlake shopping area opposite the mall, near Old Navy."}
{"text":"The best wings out here in Concord. 75 flavors who could ask for more Wing Heaven.
Excellent place to watch the game or just hang out. The bathroom was extremely clean on a Friday night. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wing junkie.. I read the reviews before coming in. All mixed. I had a great experience. Hostess was very helpful with my skepticism. I sat at the bar and the bartender was equally helpful. I like the Fox and the Hound across the street.. old faithful. They are becoming inconsistent and keep changing the menu. East Coast Wings is a breath of fresh air! Worth the stop.... and a side note... kids eat free on Wednesday with a regular order!! I will be back.. again and again and again and... oh you get it!"}
{"text":"Ok, eaten here 3x so: 
- Nice option for Harrisburg which is a good desert
- Pleasant, smallish sports bar interior
- Wings are good with all sauce options you'd expect 
- Remarkably good fries
- I was an idiot at lunch today and ordered a French Dip (Dummy). But, cmon, who makes a French dip on a pita flatbread?! That's not dippable. Might want to rethink this item, corporate..."}
{"text":"The customer service here is terrible! My wife and I eat there one or two times a week, my wife picked up some wings to bring home one night and realized there was no sauce on the wings. This and the wrong flavor has happened several times usually we will eat them anyway. This time we called and they wouldn't replace the order. Even tho we go there a lot and they know we are being honest. (We did not eat them) Not only would they not replace the order but the manager, JB I think is his name was a complete jerk to my wife about it.  Add in the fact that you can never get thru on the phone to place your order. We won't be going back anymore. Now looking at all the reviews I'm not the only one who thinks they are rude."}
{"text":"Chelsea behind the bar is awesome! Takes good care of you and gives great advice on what to order. The Kamikaze Hot Wings were so amazing I can't even put it into words! If you are in the area and love wings, it's a must"}
{"text":"I was excited to have East Coast Wings open up just minutes from my house but I was a little disappointed with my first experience.  If you get a carry out order make sure you check your food before you leave.  I ordered 25 wings to go only to discover once I got home that I only had 20 wings.  When I called back to let them know the General manager Jason offered me a credit for 5 wings the next time I come in, but it still sucks for a first experience."}
{"text":"For starters my review is based solely on the environment and the service we received.
       We went for my husbands birthday after hearing from a few of our neighbors that they had great wings. When we walked in our first impression was we had interrupted the hostesses from a conversation and they had to stop it to seat us. (Since we all get paid to sit around and talk versus work) 
       When we got to our table our waitress came by and asked for our drink orders. After ordering a drink off the menu she looked at me as if I was making up a drink. Finally I gave up and just got a water. After we placed our food order the kitchen got our order wrong and had to remake it, but when the food came out and I explained what I had ordered they gave me a look like \"are you really going to make me take this back\" finally my order came out and my food wasn't bad. The sauces we got were great. But the reason for not being satisfied was our server didn't come over one time to apologize for the mis-order or to explain how long it'd be till it was ready. We had to flag her down to get our bill and when talking to her she turned and walked away during mid conversation of asking for wet napkins.  We kept looking for the manager but was unable to locate him. He was circling the restaurant looking dissatisfied. As did all the other servers, like they didn't want to be there at all.
     Like I said not pleased by the poor service. Or lack of hospitality from this wing chain. But liked the wings."}
{"text":"By far my favorite spot in Charlotte to go to when I am in town visiting my boyfriend.  They have so many flavors and options for wings it is amazing! And somehow their carrots and celery are the best I have ever had! Amazing deserts, great service.  I look forward to East Coast Wings every time I am there!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service. Ordered $85 worth of food, stood at the to go counter for at least 5 mins before I was greeted. The manager and at least 4 employees walked by without speaking. When I asked to speak to the manager, Jonathan, he told me he was busy and thought I had been helped. Then walked away. I can see why there are 4 patrons in here at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Gave this place 2 try. I am not a fan of their wings. First time, they forgot my fries(made me walk back), then my ice cream(again i hv to go back in), then it was my drinks and dips and the celery( over all i walk back and forth) . Since i went back and forth so much they thought i was lying . And they weren't even busy. I hate walking i was gonna leave it but since it was expensive i have to get it. I don't know if dining in is better but they need to work on remembering to give customers all their orders. Lol"}
{"text":"When I found out there was an ECW in the Charlotte area, I was excited because I have loved them in the past.  This one disappointed though.  The wait staff was ok at best.  We got our food and it was wrong.....TWICE.  I'm sad to say I will never go to this location again, even though I have loved other locations in the past."}
{"text":"First time here and staff was awesome. They accommodated our large group, wings were awesome, hot, order was correct and the bottomless potato chips are a great deal and delicous. I got hot lemon pepper wings and mango habanero. Hot lemon pepper dry rub with saucy buffalo sauce is so good. We went on a Sunday and it was appropriate  for the kids as well."}
{"text":"Not only was it my first time eating wings (I'm a very picky restaurant customer), but I also ordered the Asian chicken wrap (my first time for that also). O-M-G!! Everything was amazing. We had the Chester sampler the day prior and it was better than TGIF's. My bf is so excited that we have a place we can BOTH enjoy. Not only was the food great, the service was great, the staff was friendly AND the atmosphere is fun. They play a variety of music and tons of tv's to entertain. MON & THUR are wing nights. TGIThursday :-)"}
{"text":"We've been here several times, and the food is always pretty good. The service is mediocre and not very attentive. They do have really great wings and their fries are the best I've had most anywhere in Charlotte. 

Our last visit was pretty standard for what we have experienced in the past, but instead of wings I decided to order a quesadilla. The flavor was really tasty, but it was drowned out by all the grease. Seriously, SO much grease. It made the tortilla soggy and pretty much ruined the entire thing. 

All that to be said, we'll continue to visit for the wings and fries. No more straying from their specialty!"}
{"text":"First time eating and the wings were great. I had the  lemon pepper, Mawi, Honey Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Cajun Garlic(in order of greatness) . The sweet potato waffle fries with cinnamon dip sauce was lovely. Pricing was a little higher than usual but for value I will take it. It was a to go order so not sure about customer service but good decor."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great. However I did have a complaint during this visit. We ordered a basket of the beer-battered fries and were served just regular seasoned fries. When I informed the server that this wasn't what we had ordered, he sarcastically smarted me off. Even the local family members who eat here regularly said this was not the right food item. It costed him an additional $2 from his tip because we always tip at least 20% but we didn't appreciate his smart mouth. We will continue to visit ECWG because we love their food but maybe not this location."}
{"text":"We really enjoy their boneless wings and usually get the Tuesday night platter so we can try one of their many delicious sauces.  Their staff is very friendly and if there is any problem with your order, they are great about making it right.  I eat out at many different restaurants and while no one expects a problem with their order, the best restaurants are able to turn a problem into a positive review as is the case with manager Dave and his quick resolution to my problem this evening!  Kudos to you and your team!  Great food AND great attitudes!  That counts a lot these days.  I am very impressed!"}
{"text":"Holy moley, I was blown away by the variety of wings they have here.  I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews? (I guess Yelp isn't very prominent in this area.)

We came in a little late, but our waitress was so sweet and peppy.  I definitely had to give her mad props for her cheery attitude.  The fried pickles were OK, but could have been better.  The outer shell was delightfully hot and crisp, but the pickle spear threatened to fall out with every bite.  The wings were huge!  We ordered the \"Hot\" wings, but they really seemed more like a \"medium,\" so I felt a little disappointed by that.  Although, I do understand every individual has a different spice tolerance.  I didn't feel any spice in our \"Hot Wings.\"  They come out with giant squirt bottles of condiments, so there's no need to ask for refills.  

Overall, it was a very friendly place.  The wings are ginormous and the variety of bar food is incredible.  I wish I had a place like this near me, although it wouldn't be very healthy, but everything else looked pretty good on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place if you like paying for cold chicken wings!!! Ok so to start off my review my husband and I had just flown in to the area for the holidays and my parents recommended that we go to East Coast Wings & Grill for some wings. They had been multiple times and said the wings were the closest they had to Buffalo style wings in the area. Needless to say we were excited to give them a try. Upon entering the restaurant we were sat down at a booth that had moveable benches and I almost felt down upon trying to sit. Our waitress, Kim, came over right away and greeted us and got our drink order. She brought us back our drinks quickly and took our food order. I ordered five wings with the teriyaki flavor and everyone else ordered medium regular wings with a basket of fries. The guys ordered draft beer as well. To our surprise the basket of fries came out before the beers did and were very hot and delicious. About 30 seconds later our wings came out. It seemed odd because we had just ordered five minutes before and that is not enough time to cook wings but we were all hungry and started eating. Everyone took bites of their wings and stopped....they were barely warm and close to room temperature. We called the waitress over and explained the issue and she took our wings back to be remade. The manager, Jason, brought out our \"new\" wings and apologized stating he gave us a few extra for the inconvenience. My first two wings that were on top were steaming hot but the ones on the bottom were still cold as were the rest of the wings on the table. To also be noted one of my partially eaten wings with a deformed bone sticking out of had made it back on my plate. We called the manager, Jason, over and complained. He immediately argued with us saying he threw out the old wings and brought new wings to the table. I explained that the strange wing from my first attempt at the wings was still on the plate and there is no way they did more than just microwave the old wings. He continued to argue with my parents and was extremely disrespectful. Jason obviously does not understand the concept of customer service. Jason took our plates away and Kim came back over and asked us if we wanted anything else. We all declined and as we were waiting for the check, I got up to use the ladies room. To my surprise the bathroom was dirty and had paper towels overflowing from the trash and stunk. I rushed out quickly trying to hold my breath and not touch anything. Upon returning to the table, Kim came over with our check and told us Jason had given us a deal on our check and was only going to charge us for 15 wings (the amount he said we ate) instead of the ordered 25 and everything else we ordered. While I did not expect him to comp everything, I surely did not expect to pay for wings that were cold. To top it off we didn't even eat 15 wings. If I could give this place a negative five stars I would. If you are the owner of this establishment and happen to actually read the comments, I would like to make a business suggestion: Fire Jason. We will never go back nor will we let anyone we know go to this place....stay away yelpers as you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of the best dining experiences I have had at this style of restaurant in a very long time.  I was so impressed, no, I was delighted, with my experience I had to seek out my waitress and the manager and let them know they're doing an excellent job.

I am not eating bread - reasons - and I asked for a burger wrapped in lettuce.  I was informed it couldn't be wrapped so much as sandwiched - no problem.  They did an excellent job selecting good sized lettuce leaves to accommodate the two patty burger.

The bathroom was wonderful.  It was immaculately clean, smelled great, and everything from toilets to the door hardware were in good working order. I have been to restaurants like steak houses and those charging $50 per plate worse bathrooms.  This place is well managed and exceeds expectations.

It looks like an ordinary East Coast Wings & Grill but everything is clean, and everyone is nice.  If I was in charge of training people I would send them to this location to see how it is done.  I am so enthused about my experience I am going to write corporate and let them know they have a real opportunity to seize and acknowledge the great work being done here.

Look at my other reviews - I am very particular and critical.  I don't just lavish 5s all over the place.

The food is fine, so if you carry out you won't be getting the full five star experience of dinning in.  I enjoyed the flavor and preparation of my hamburger.  I also recommend changing your fries to the green beans - they come in a tasty bath of garlic and other flavors.

Keep up the great work, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went in for a tasty lunch special: buffalo shrimp, homemade chips and a Mountain Dew for $8.50 plus tip. Great deal. The shrimp was delicious. I thought they might only give me 4 or 5 but it was a decent amount. Drizzled with medium buffalo sauce. The homemade chips are delicious along with their homemade ranch dressing. My only complaint is that they used to play rock n roll but changed the music to be teeny bopper crap. I complained but management wouldn't budge. What happened to the customer is always right??? Please change music back to good ol rock n roll, managers! Anyways, the food and service was excellent. Music blows."}
{"text":"Well, it was great to hear I would be checking out a new wing place. I'd never heard of East Coast Wings before this trip with group of guy friends for some post-car show eats.

We decided to sit at the bar and they took quite some time to get service, plus the bar top was never cleaned after the previous customers left so it was very dirty and sticky.
At some point we were finally able to get assistance from the bartender to order drinks and eventually food. 

They do have daily drink specials which is nice. But, their bottle/can selection seemed limited... and that was part of the Friday special. The bartender did help me give me some ideas about which flavor wings to choose, that was nice given she seemed stressed.

My wings were meaty and flavorful. I would probably eat them again. The fries were seriously lacking flavor, almost fell in line with a frozen fry. Unacceptable in 2017! Three Stars? Yeah, between the service and cleanliness that's where I landed."}
{"text":"Can someone please explain why this location was turning away customers on Super Bowl Sunday, telling customers that they were closing bc of the Super Bowl. Why would a wings restaurant/bar, that prides itself on providing sports entertainment on its many TV's, close on Super Bowl Sunday? No less than 5 cars drove up during the 3 minutes we were there to ask the same thing. What was further disturbing is that there were around 10 people in the restuarant at the time? Is it standard practice to close a location on what could possibly be one of the busiest nights of the year? It was the manager that turned us away and I didn't catch her name."}
{"text":"We ate at 3:30pm.  Service was surprisingly slow for an off peak time. We had sweet and sour shrimp tacos with sweet potato waffle fries. Very good!  The fries were served with a wonderful dip. We also ordered:

Bacon Cheeseburger Quesadilla 10.99
A grilled tortilla stuffed with seasoned Angus ground beef, bacon, diced tomatoes, melted aged cheddar and American cheeses. Accompanied by salsa and sour cream.

It had about as much beef as a McDonalds hamburger....it was grossly over cooked and couldn't even cover half of the tortilla. The cheese looked and tasted like canned nacho cheese and that's it!  No bacon...no tomatoes...and no sides of sour cream or salsa. 

I showed it to our waiter and he took it back to the kitchen. The replacement was still thin on the beef...but the additional ingredients as listed on the menu. 

With the variety of available restaurants in the immediate area to choose from, I don't think I would try this again."}
{"text":"Wow was i impressed!

I love wings and love trying new places. Stopped in for lunch while visiting Concord and couldn't have asked for better wings. 

The service was mediocre, at best, but the wings mad us feel better! The server did not know the sizes (in ounces) of the little or tall beer. Really? She also took our order for wings and then had to come back because she did not know what my second wing order flavor was. 

The beer and food selection was on POINT! There are too many wing flavors and so little time to try them all. I got two wing flavors with my wings; Extra hot + Sweet BBQ and the General Tso's. I wish the hot/bbq was a lot hotter. There was not a sense of heat, but still were very good. The General Tso's were off the wall good! The blue cheese was a decent size for the price and the hot version of it was interesting. The wing size was large.

Greenville, SC could use a location!"}
{"text":"Manager is definitely a racist idiot!! Have conversation with your employees before u look like a complete ass again"}
{"text":"*****update**** 
They emailed and said it's a franchise location and they would look into it! I never heard back, so I'll never step foot in ECW again, which is a shame, they do have tasty wings!


We went to EastCoast Northlake here in Charlotte last night for my birthday. My wings came out incorrectly and the ones that were correct, were cold. I asked for them to be replaced, after about 15 mins, they brought them out. I had not been checked on at all during that time, we had no napkins and my drink order had never been filled. I then asked for the manager. At 20 min mark someone came out and said he was still on the phone, but she was part time manager but not today. I said, I'll wait. The owner/manager came out at the 29 minute mark after asking for him (49 minutes total) and before I could explain anything he told me that this could go one of 2 ways, he could make my experience perfect or he could call the cops. You can imagine at this point, I am very upset and this guy threatens me. I tell him to call the cops on me, that I would wait. I am 100% disabled veteran, a former cop and a teacher in this community, so most of cops know me, so I told him to let them know that SSG Merritt would be here waiting. He pretended to call the cops and my spouse insisted that we leave as I was starting to really get upset. 
I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life, especially when I was the one wronged. I love the wings there and used to go to the Mooresville location weekly and I was on the wall of flame. But after the hostility created by the owner and getting the cops called on me when his restaurant was the one who screwed up, I plan to tell every person I know and post on every social media outlet about the treatment I received at that location and on my birthday."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good wings and decent food. But the General Manager, Mike D., is one of the rudest, crassest people I have ever encountered. My family eats here on a regular basis in spite of the poor management. We had a large group recently and not only would they not hold a table, after I arrived just ahead of our group Mike stepped up and refused to seat me at the table since 1/2 if our group was not present. I asked if he was the General Manager and he said that he was. He talked down to me and was rude and inconsiderate. They weren't even that busy and I would have left and NEVER returned except that our group was on the way. You would do much better to go to Buffalo Wild Wings and skip the hassle this place will give you in spite of the decent wings. By the way, Mike refused to give me his full name or his manager's full name and number.  Mike needs to find a job not dealing with the public."}
{"text":"Got the build your burger Tues special .. great deal for 5 bucks .. also got wings buffalo , Polynesian and some Caribbean island name .. all very good tastes .. overall a great tasty dinner for two"}
{"text":"The food was really good. It had been years sine I been and I'm happy that I decided to give them another try. I always ask for my songs to be cool crispy and they were fried to perfection. The fries were delicious."}
{"text":"I really like East Coast wings. I've been several times. We have 3 small children (1 is a infant, so he doesn't count...lol), but the food is accommodating for their selective taste. Looooove the buffalo flavored chips! Good gracious they are delicious! My fave wings are the boneless garlic-parm medium heat wings. The wings were average when we first started to go there it was breaded with a thick flour coating, but they changed the boneless wing and it is now much better. And you MUST try the peach lemonade. 

 My gripe though, is with to-go orders. They seem to be \"stingy\". I never get a plastic fork, or napkins to go. When you dine in they bring out a tall bottle of Ranch (which is delicious by the way) to share and small cups for dispensing to guest at the table, but when it's to-go they give you one cup and DARE you to ask for more!!! Also, if you order the yummy buffalo flavored chips as a basket, they give you 1 container as opposed to when it's dine in they keep the baskets coming! Which we like because we can all share. Since our little ones are small and my oldest is school age and he gets out of school at 4, it's easy to just grab dinner, go home and eat, instead of dining in. But when going the carry out route here, we run the risk of our food portions being short changed, so we opt out and go some where else."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and out drink order was taken.   Seemed a little long to get fountain drinks. 

Order taken promptly.  Service was good.  

Both ordered wraps and chips.  Good and filling.  Could not eat all of the chips."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience....! My boyfriend and I went today 1/5/17 around 9pm. We were seated and then didn't get any service for 15 mins. 3 Servers passed by us. No one asked if we were okay or anything. Tables were seated after us and we watched as others got helped while we were still waiting for a server to come. We wanted to give this place a try because we live close."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch and am rarely disappointed. Their salads are great. If you're looking for a variety of salads with plenty of ingredients, you've come to the right place. My only complaint is that sometimes the food is slow getting to your table."}
{"text":"This was our first visit for a birthday celebration!! It was amazing the best wings I think I've ever had!!! We ordered wing mild and medium fried pickles fries sliders burgers it was all great!! Everyone said the same thing!! Nothing was forgotten drinks stayed filled etc!! I have to say we had the most awesome waiter Paul I've ever had!! He is so nice took everyone's order without writing anything down and for 11 people everyone's order was correct!!!! He is an awesome guy please let management know how well he does his job!! We will be back for sure I hope he will be there to wait on us again!! This is a gem of a restaurant so glad we had my birthday dinner there!! Thanks ECW and Paul for making our night!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be like me and pass this place by hundreds of times. I stopped by today and the food was great. The have a versatile menu that sure to have something to please anyone. Of course the wings are a must try! They have so many different flavors. I had Mango Bango wings and  the Chicken Philly and fries. Great fries with a yummy beer flavor. Good service here and the food was hot a fresh. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I usually go to the one in Kannapolis where they have the ranch bottles that go on your table so I was disappointed they didn't have them. That didn't let me down too much because they give you big cups of said ranch (homemade by the way) for your fries/wings/meal... Just ask for some. The fries are to die for, seriously. Obviously you should try their traditional wings but their wraps are also a hit!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I fell in love with this place a month ago when I went there the first time. I went once a week since! Wings are obviously the best. They have ranch with but cups for your entire table. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Excellent wings!  Local draft beer, with drink specials.  Atmosphere wasn't too loud.  Friendly staff.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Their customer service sucks- from the hostess to the waiter! The drink my boyfriend ordered was watered down so much. I don't even think it was a cocktail. The wings might have been decent but the fact that they came out cold made me think they might have been someone's previous order sent back hours before we came. Overall - I will never go here again"}
{"text":"Don't take the insanity wing challenge unless you're prepared to shit fire, water the next day."}
{"text":"Very good wings. Have been here several times and food always pretty good. Love the  baby bella mushroom appetizer with sriracha ranch. Sometimes service slow but not a bad place for wings and beer."}
{"text":"Great wings!  The shrimp in buffalo sauce is so good too.  It's a nice spot to watch any game and meet up with friends for drinks.  It's reasonably priced as well, and a different atmosphere if you are looking for a wing place other than Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Friday night shenanigans!

The wings flavors are tasty! The .65 cent wing deal is great just be prepared to pay for each flavor you add. The pretzel appetizer was delicious. Don't waste your time with the french fries....  they are usually a hit or miss. 

The atmosphere is very casual and spacious. The staff is very lack so be prepared to wait patiently on tasty wings. 

Don't I repeat Don't bother with dessert!!!!."}
{"text":"I have been to other ECW locations and been pleased so when my man said he wanted to go here for wings, I was cool with it. However, this proved to be my worst visit to ECW. 

Here is what went well: our server, Dan, was cool and attentive. He wanted to make sure we enjoyed our experience. Also, the chips were perfect! That was, without a doubt, the best part of the entire meal. 

Which leads me to the worst part of the visit, our meals. My boyfriend got the cheddar jalapeño wings and the garlic Parmesan wings (both of which he had before at another location). The garlic parm wings were good but the cheddar jalapeño had entirely too much cheese sauce. Someone else in a review described it as cheese whiz and I think that was a good description. The amount of thick sauce on this made it pretty unappealing. He finished the garlic parm but not the cheddar jalapeño. 

I got the crispy shrimp wrap with kamakazi (spelling?) sauce. This wrap could have been great except: 
1. There was soooooooo much sauce in the wrap that there were bites of just tortilla and pockets of sauce
2. The shrimp was overcooked. I don't know if the issue is the oil needing changed in the fryer or what but there were a few bites that were so hard that I looked to make sure a bone had not gotten into the wrap. 

In conclusion, I've had good experiences at ECW. Unfortunately it just hasn't been at this location."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I ate here was about 2 weeks after they opened.  It was an incredibly long wait on a Saturday evening,  but ok.  The wings were really greasy and chewy,  over cooked.  We figured they just hadn't found their rhythm with the new opening so we gave them another chance a month later.  Same experience,  really greasy and overcooked.  If you're going to be a wings place,  then make good chicken. Sorry to say it's not for us and we love wings."}
{"text":"Great place with great staff and management. We are excited ECW came to Harrisburg as we love their 2 other locations. The food is quick and tasty. Love the wings."}
{"text":"Ecw is one of our family favorites.  My husband and I usually get the grilled boneless tenders with homemade chips.  They have great sauces, my personal favorite is grand cayman.  They have kids eat free on Wednesdays, and that is always a nice perk.  The best dessert ever is the cookie on the hot skillet, super yummy.  Last item is their pub pretzels, get with the beer cheese"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte, my friend brings me here for lunch. The atmosphere is typical sports bar/wing spot. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated immediately. Service was prompt, helpful and very friendly. Often checking on diners, but not to the point of annoyance.

Now the food and drink. The beer selection is pretty good, they have several options for each type of beer so anyone should be able to find something they like.  Wings are not the only option on the menu with various sandwich and burger options to cover your craving. 

The wings, of course, have the option of bone-in or boneless, as well as varying levels of heat.I chose the bone- in with volcanic level. I had the cheddar jalapeno, kamikaze and the black and bleu. With the cheddar jalapeno, be prepared for a bit of a mess as it is similar in consistency to cheez whiz. The black and bleu were mild. Not overpowering on either the cajun or bleu cheese flavors, well balanced. And the kamikaze wings brought down the heat a little with hints of ginger and soy. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who visits Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food here is meh. We went in at 8 pm yesterday and were seated right away. Food came out in reasonable time but was just so-so. Once we had our food and a drink refill, it was forever before we saw the server again. We were ready for our check for a good 10 minutes before he even passed by and with the food being so meh, I was really eager to leave. I think a lot of the employees at this location spend more time socializing than really worrying about the customers. Won't go back to this location again but don't rule out all ECW based on your experience here."}
{"text":"Food is always good but never go dine in if your expecting to watch a late game. We went to watch the monday night game and had the tvs cut off on us at halftime. Better off going to buffalo wild wings or hooters if u plan on watching a game. Also tv doesn't have sound so it kinda sucks to watch a big game with music over the top."}
{"text":"Let's talk wings! If one is craving a relaxed environment to have a few brews or perhaps indulge in a margarita sampler, eat an order of homemade potato chips and devour countless wings with an endless list of sauce options, this is the place to be! The kind waitstaff is always more than willing to not only engage in a brief question answer session but truly make sure you are enjoying your experience. Now, aside from the slightly loud atmosphere on the weekends, this is the place to go for a quick and casual eat with a few of your buddies or a causal night out! Then again, a bit of cheering and booing comes with the constant stream of athletic games East Coast Wings and Grill displays on their numerous televisions!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here verrry frequently and honestly it's a hit or miss. Your service will make or break your experience here. We've only had about three good servers here. The turnover rate with the servers and staff is crazy! There's new people in there serving every week and honestly some should NOT be in the food service industry. The food is good, I can't get my boyfriend away from the chicken philly but it's hard for me to go spend money somewhere I know that there is a 50/50 chance my service is going to suck. Most of the time it's pretty fast but today we went and the service was awful. We waited almost 10 minutes to be greeted. The server was clearly new and just not friendly or grateful for the 20% tip he DID NOT deserve. Oh well, it's the chance you have to take to eat here."}
{"text":"Not the worse East Coast that we have been to but definitely not the best. We have been several times and they still can't figure out how to make sweet tea. The bags need to be steeped longer and it needs more sugar (seriously, I can almost read a newspaper through it). 

Now, onto the food. The wings are good but that is about it. They aren't \"great\" and thankfully got better than our first visit but they aren't the same as some of your other locations. Also, the French fries, which we always order, keep getting worse and worse. Today's was the worse we ever have gotten and half of them were still stuck together in a glob. 

Service- gosh, it is hit or miss. Previous times we either had good or excellent service. Today was horrible. When we failed to order an appetizer, our waitress put on an attitude. After getting our meal, she came to check on us, 7 minutes later, asking if we would like desert. When we declined because we were still eating, she stated she was going to get our check and asked if we would like to-go boxes. Again, while we were still eating.. 

We won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE the ranch dressing! I picked up some wings on NYE because most pubs would be packed. My fiancé recommended this place. I'm glad he did. The wings were pretty delicious. The drunken apple flavor was tasty, but it is sweet so be warned. He likes sweet, I'm more of a spicy kind of woman. I ordered some that did have a kick and was not disappointed. I'll definitely be back. It's probably comparable to BWW, but I prefer East Coast ranch!! (They also gave me a large portion of ranch, which was no disappointment. I'm told if you dine in, they give you a bottle of it unlike most other places that charge you extra)."}
{"text":"I have been here about five times and it has been really good! Great service and the food is great! The smores dessert was not that good but that is the only bad thing everything else has always been good! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon and I was craving some wings.  I prefer East Coast to other wing joints because the chicken portions seem to be bigger, and I like the home made ranch dressing.  Today I ordered the 3 chicken strip lunch with fries and Pepsi.  I have to admit, the strips were really meaty and tender.  I ordered them 'medium' which seems to just have enough spice without being obnoxious.  I would definitely order this again.  The seasoned fries were very good also.  ive had their home made chips too which are also great and very filling."}
{"text":"Love this location of ECW!

Insha was our server tonight and she took great care of us. Always attentive, we never had to ask for refills or anything. We chose to sit outside...until a wasp terrorized us. Staff were gracious in moving our drinks inside. 

Hubby and I usually order the \"flight\" that comes with 25 wings (five flavors). Our go-to flavors are Grand Cayman (a must try), Thai chilli, Cajun (dry rub) and kamikaze. 

They always have drink specials. We have been ordering the draft ales lately, great match with wings!"}
{"text":"Seated immediately at 7pm on a Saturday during (pre) football season. Score!

Kristen \"Poppy\" F as our server. Score!

I don't understand why anyone would come here and not order wings. They're amazing!

We usually get the Flight that comes with 25 wings/5 flavors. We double up on Grand Cayman (our favorite flavor). If you like dry rubs, go with Cajun. The sweet-spicy blend of Kamikaze is another favorite of ours. Tonight we went with Thai chilli. Flavors tonight... score!

They're no longer on the menu, but if you ask they'll make buffalo fries for you. They're crispy fries tossed in buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Score!

Only minor thing that went wrong was Poppy forgot to put in my peach margarita order. Five yard penalty. 

We definitely won the restaurant choice game with ECW tonight! #champions"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I just moved in the area and my roommate brought home a menu she picked up. Fast forward a few weeks and a few friends decided to grab some food and chose to order from here. I got the New Orleans styled boneless wings, I believe half NOLA and half Bourbon. They were great. I'm truly shocked by the amount of flavors the offer overall. Myself and 3 others placed a takeout order and were glad that everything was organized and completed in a timely manner. Next time I'll have to dine in and explore more of menu and drinks."}
{"text":"Love the Bartender, Kara! 
The food is much better bar food than most places like Wild Wings Yuck! Beer specials use to be awesome but not so much anymore. Great service every time I've been here. We have been loyal customers since they first opened!"}
{"text":"Tried East Coast Wings & Grill while driving to Raleigh and we decided to stop to get something to eat. Had seen the place previously when in Kannapolis but didn't get to stop at that time. The wings are very good, nice and crispy and a variety of flavors. I opted for the Garlic Parm and Bourbon Apple (my favorite) and an order of beer battered fries (which were also very good). The best part is they give you cups of Ranch dressing with everyone's meal and its home-made and delicious. Id recommend this place and would go back again."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and helpful with navigating the menu. They'd get 5 stars, but not the food.

The wings were overpriced and steroid-chunky! We paid approx. $30+ tax for approx. 25 Honey Garlic Flavored wings and strongly disliked them. 

The place was recommended because they're a new \"hot\" growing business. I'll stick to American Deli. I'm guaranteed to get more bang for my buck at American Deli."}
{"text":"Case of The Sweaty Waiter Syndrome

I came here today with a very important coworker bragging about how great the wings were (which they still are), but that is not my issue. My issue was with the waiter OMG!, I never saw so much lack of hygiene in my life. Our waiter was sweating while taking our order, and wiping his face at the same time. I thought to myself should I eat here or just leave. The only reason I stayed was that I invited my coworker to East Coast Wings.At least the waiter could have gone to the bathroom to wash his hands and face before taking the next customer. I usually only order carryout, but since this event, I plan not to eat here anymore. Because if the people in the front end or dirty, I can only imagine what is going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wings and beer. The perfect combo. 

Had lunch today with a buddy featuring the above. I think they have great wings. Fried to a crunchy outside, moist and tender inside, then tossed in the sauce of your choice. Delish. And speaking of choices for the sauce. Wow. I think there are 75 to choose from!  Yes 75!  Something for everyone. Oh and they have great fries too. All washed down with tasty and cold beer. Yum."}
{"text":"I ordered the wings. They were very good and I had plenty of sauce favors to choose from.  
My wife got the carnitas tacos.  They were awesome and came with ECW's famous homemade chips.  
The service was quick and the server was very knowledgeable and nice."}
{"text":"The wings here are good enough.  The beer selection isn't bad either.  The 'kids eat free night' is  a deal.  My only complaint- the floors in the men's room always seem to be mopped in grease.  I always feel like I'm sliding around on the floor.  What's up with that?"}
{"text":"I am truly disappointed in the level of customer service I was just given . I placed a order for some wings and I was charged extra for sauce I cancelled , when I brought it to the manager JD or JT was his name ..attention he had a straight attitude and look in all my boxes like I was lying or something. Honestly if the food was for me I would have just cancelled the order because of his rudeness ..Not sure what his problem was but  he was rude and unfriendly..no apology no smile or anything. I live in Harrisburg and there are a few places to eat at and honestly he made east coast wings look bad . I've never had a problem till today and honestly I'm not sure if I will be returning."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years because it's close to home and usually has no wait. They re-did their newest menu and I have to say I am not impressed. They took away the chicken and waffles and this toasted avocado sandwich. Hostess' at this place suck and don't look like they want to be there. Servers are good and efficient. Managers are cool as hell and very personable. They will sit down and have a conversation with you. I liked that. Overall, bring in some greeters and hostess' that aren't tweeting or snapchatting, and put the other items back on the menu that everyone liked!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Mountain Island, ECW has become our \"Go-To\" for wings in North Charlotte.  I'm a long-time BW3 customer, but ECW's variety and quality of sauces has won us over.  We consistently have good experiences with the wings and other menu items, service is adequate, the beers are cold, and TVs plentiful in the bar area.

Recommend $0.50 Boneless Wings night on Thursdays and really like some original flavors such as Martinique or Harvest Apple.  If you have a family, Wednesdays are family nights;  if you don't have a family, you may want to stay home that night."}
{"text":"Ordered 70+ wings from here today to go...     order was correct & on time....     Visited this location last weekend as well and placed a to go order.     Order was correct and on time.     Will def order from again"}
{"text":"The waitstaff was great but the food was horrible it was nothing like what the menu stated. I asked for a to go box and I put the wings that I did not eat in a box which was seven.  I asked accidentally left the box on the table. I asked the manager the next day can replace what I left, they stated no. I lost my money and I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Recently been on a wing kick for the past month or so but the great thing is that I am in search of a decent regular wing place - AND its just wings (WIN, WIN).  A friend of mine mentioned that a new wing place at Northlake opened up so we went to check it out after doing a pretty strenuous bike ride in the afternoon.

It was super busy (guess it had just opened so everyone had the same idea to come check it out).... so there was some confusion about wait time for a table.  We ended up sitting a the bar area which was first come first serve.

Our server was new - I had the impression he spent more time writing his name on his name tag than studying the menu.  Not trying to be mean, but a lot of the questions we had he seemed to know the answer, but didn't really...  After ordering a round of beers (which he didn't really know what they offered) and having \"Fat Tire\" interpreted as \"Fast Liar\"... I was a little skeptical.  I received a work phone call that I had to take but by the time I got back to the table, the beers were still not there.

I actually had the Carnitas (not wings like I was craving) and was pretty impressed.  The pork was slow cooked and the ingredients were fresh.

Other than the service issues, this place would get a re-visit from me but I'll wait for the crowds to die down before I give it another chance."}
{"text":"A little bit pricey, but good wings. It is about the same as any other wing place around so nothing special and not anymore overpriced than Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute RIP-OFF!  We were served a crown and coke in a 4oz glass where the one shot of crown literally took up half the space.  The cost for such a drink is $8.50.  

I asked the bartender about it in a polite manner thinking it was a mistake.  She replied,\"our drink prices are high but our beer prices are better\".  

The food was pretty good but the drink prices are like robbery.  I feel violated. We will not return because of ECW left us feeling \"taken\" for a ride."}
{"text":"Stopped in here spur of the moment. We were actually headed to Five Guys but I noticed this place and my date has a soft spot for wings, so we decided to give it a shot.

We ordered a cheeseburger, blazing bacon wings, cheese sticks and the sugar doughnut holes with chocolate sauce.

The cheeseburger- fantastic! The bread was soft but didn't fall apart. I was pleasantly surprised. A few bites in, I knew I would be back. My date enjoyed her wings and ate every last one. We chose chocolate sauce to dip the powered donuts in. The chocolate was dark and we didn't care for it very much. All in all I enjoyed our meal and the price was reasonable. We'd definitely be back."}
