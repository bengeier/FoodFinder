{"text":"The biggest problem with this place is the owner. Besides the food being overpriced and mediocre to not good, the few times I have been in here the owner John acted as if I was more of an inconvenience than a paying customer. He nickel and dimes everything. The coffees are half full and he always tries to work an angle to give you less than you pay for. I can't see this place being around for another year or so and frankly I'm surprised it lasted this long. If you are hungry, Cozumel is next door and I have never had a problem with service or food quality. Next time I want donuts and coffee, Dunkin Donuts will earn my business."}
{"text":"Was in here yesterday......heard a constant steady beep....beep....beep.........couldn't figure it out....then after touring the place I realized it was the life support machine."}
{"text":"I had not been to Francesco's for quite a while.  I stopped there today and bought the daily special - stuffed cabbage rolls and homestyle mashed potatoes.  It was one of the worst stuffed cabbage roll dishes I've ever had.  Not seasoned well.  Cabbage was very tough.  Some pieces were almost raw.  And the 'mashed potatoes'?  Threw most of it away.  This place seems to have continually gone downhill over the past few months.  I doubt I will be back again."}
{"text":"A late girls' lunch, so we decided to stop here as we'd heard good things. First, we tried the wedding soup. It was full of meatballs and chicken and flavor! i could have used some tiny noodles in it, but that's my only suggestion. We had the meatloaf sweet mashed potato special. It was delicious! We also had the chicken parm and cavatelli with meatballs. The chicken and meatballs were great. The cavatelli was overlooked for my liking and lacking in salt or flavor. I like the bottleWe visited the bakery case as well. Cookies are sold by the pound, but it wasn't difficult to get a pound! The man (co-owner) behind the case was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. We were the only eat-in diners, but there was a lot of to-go foot traffic. The restaurant was clean and staff was friendly, especially Rodney. He prepared our meals and was just very sweet. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time this weakened after my neighbors raved about it.  All I wanted was a decent hoagie and that is what I got.  The selection of bakery items looked incredible and the prepared foods looked good too.  I will be stopping by again to pick something up for dinner some night.  This is tucked away in a hidden plaza that doesn't get much traffic, but is a place to search out if you want to grab a quick sub, slice of Neapolitan (rectangular)  pizza to go or enjoy a prepared lasagna there."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch for four. It was around 12:30 and there were only three or four other parties seated. The dining area is pretty big and the deli, comprising both sit down and carry out sections, is set up a little like a food court with several different counter areas and food types, mainly as you may guess focusing on Italian specialties, soups, salads and bread and pastries.

The server was attentive but the food was slow to come out of the kitchen; she did check on us and let us know and that was appreciated. We had a Chicken Parmesan sub, a triple decker BLT,Linguini with Marinara sauce,and a turkey and swiss sub + 3 ice teas and 5 pieces of fried dough for dessert.

The BLT was tasty and well executed; the Turkey sub was just fine but nothing stood out; Lettuce, tomato, turkey, swiss cheese on a roll. My youngest daughter finished all of the Spaghetti and said it was good. My oldest daughter had issues with the Chicken Parm sub; I guess when it's a \"Sub\" instead of a \"sandwich\" there is tomato on the \"sub\" which she was not expecting, doesn't like and had to remove. 

The fried dough was not what i was expecting; I was thinking zeppole but it had a different name and was thicker and a little chewy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't something I personally would order again; I am sure there are people who like it. I was not fond of the texture, but that's an opinion. 

All in all, pretty good food - we could have saved money by ordering one of the many daily specials but decided to get what we wanted for a few dollars more. The food at Francesco's is quite good, generally - I love their pizza and the donuts and other bakery items are really good.I did not hate anything I tried today, but nothing swept me off my feet either.

Total tab for the 3 sandwiches, pasta with marinara sauce, 3 ice teas and 5 orders of the fried dough came to $38.96 and then add on the tip, so about $11 person including tip, maybe a little more than I would ordinarily spend on lunch for three kids who are just as happy eating hot dogs, but probably right on par for a lunch with friends or co-workers.

**Remember, they are NOT open on MONDAYS**"}
{"text":"Been here several times and it's never the same. Food quality remains great, if they have it. How does a Italian deli not have meatballs!? That being said, service completely dependent on who working. If you come here enough, you will know what to expect as soon as you see who is behind the counters. 3 stars for now, should be more but can't find consistency."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place opening! The previous business was sub standard at best. We'll, after several visits I will not bother going back. First time, waited at the deli to be waited on for 10 minutes. Second and third visits , same experience. Last Wed. stopped in around
8 am. to pick up some bread and lunchmeat ( they open at 6 am.) again not one person that can wait on me at the deli. please have your staff trained!. I didn't think the service could be worse than Gigantis, but again another horrible business!  UPDATE:
Things have greatly improved  here!"}
{"text":"Walked in noon on a Mon... Sign said \"open\" but it was empty. I was interested in trying some bakery, and a man came over to help, he seemed to be the owner or manager. He was not friendly...he seemed annoyed. I asked if they make cakes and he said it is their specialty, but I didn't see one cake in the store. I was telling him which bakery I wanted and it became very difficult. I only wanted 2 large kolaczki cookies, but he insisted he only sells them by the pound (??? REALLY) Even if you sell them by the pound someone can still order 1 or 2 dude. Since I only wanted a sampling of a few things, he seemed to be very frustrated with me, I even apologized for being so difficult, and he said \"the customer is always right\" which made no sense... I wasn't right about anything, I just wanted to try some bakery. I was really turned off by this rudeness. MOVING ON, after he boxed up what I wanted and I was checking out, he noted he was \"Only going to charge me for 1 cannoli NOT 2 since the shells were soggy\" WHAT? WHY WOULD I EVEN PAY FOR ONE SOGGY CANNOLI? Help me understand why you would sell something you know is bad? I wouldn't even have given those away for free...I was so taken back by this, I didn't know what to say and left like a fool. The bakery was terrible. The cannoli was soggy and my heart was soggy with tears that I ever parted with my money. The kolachy were hard as bricks and too doughy gross. HE SHOULD HAVE PAID ME. The slice of pizza I got was ok, but I will not be back, there's far better places to go. With that sort of business he won't be there long. Waste of money (18.99 to be exact) and calories. My husband and mother both tried the bakery and wouldn't touch more than a bite. The box is still sitting on my kitchen counter, half tempted to return it."}
{"text":"This place has been around for while now- with the new addition of breakfast, lunch, and dinner-(and a server) I highly recommend. They have fantastic $5.99 Lunch specials that include a sub, homemade soup, and a coke. They also have a hot bar with spaghetti, parms, etc...along with a great Bakery! 

Please note- They are CLOSED on Monday's!"}
{"text":"went there early in the am to see if they had any good breakfast pastries (which i think the selection was extremely slim) the older gentleman was very rude and unpleasant, as if he was bothered by me coming in to take a look....prices are extremely high. i would not go back. michaelangels down the street is worth the couple extra minutes! :)"}
{"text":"I called last week to place an order at around 9am for catering for 6 around lunchtime for a business meeting. I was somewhat flexible on menu and exact time. The person seemed a little annoyed and said, we just opened, give me a minute to get a pencil. Then later during the conversation mentioned they were short staffed \"working on skeleton crew\", they were very busy over the holiday so they have limited stock (only noodle choice penne), they can't do delivery, and so \"you want this for TODAY\"? I just felt like I was inconveniencing them overall. I ended up calling Danny Boys at 11 when they opened and they were here w delivery in just over an hour (friendly service, fair price, good food). 
I will say I have used Francesco's for catering in the past (placing an order was a little rough, had to wait for a call back on price, needed me to tell them exactly what I wanted versus being able to say \"put together a menu around X price for X people\"), but the food was good when it arrived (sandwhich deli tray, anti-pasto, cookies) and was enjoyed."}
{"text":"CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED 

Apparently Fracnesco's lived down to the terrible reviews enough that people stopped going. That's exactly how the market's supposed to work. They showed great promise early but their inconsistency just killed them. 

Adios."}
{"text":"I like going here for lunch or to pick up take-out.  The deli is owned and run by a family, and honestly service can occasionally be a little slow.  I've gotten doughnuts before and a few dessert items that were really good.  My boyfriend loves the pepper and sausage sub.  They make everything from scratch using family recipes.  The deli has a substantial selection, and they have good brunch.  They close early, so go before 8pm.  If you like them on Facebook, you can get exclusive offers."}
{"text":"Saturday was my first time at Francesco's to get a Birthday Cassata Cake for my wife. I drove 35 minutes from Twinsburg because this place came highly recommended. 

We were not disappointed. We have had cassata cakes from several bakeries including Corbo's and they always sounded better than they tasted. Francesco's was excellent and by far the best one we ever had. 

I was also surprised by the deli and cafe. They had a nice selection and seemed to be relatively busy. 

This place was well worth the drive and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery.  The desserts were really good.  But the doughnuts are amazing.  I've taken them to a few meetings and EVERYONE wants to know where they came from.  They love them.  Service is great.  Never had to wait long at all."}
