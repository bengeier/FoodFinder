{"text":"We are happy to see chef Hama again.  He only helps out 3 days a week for the owner and main chef. This owner had a restaurant in downtown formover 20 years.The fish quality is excellent. From appterzier to dessert everything is great. Salad really fresh with their tasty house dressing.  Ordered black cod, sunomono, and grill shrimp for appertizer all very delicious ( but remember portion is very small) . Ordering a la carte for sushi and sashimi. Fish super fresh!   I have to say server is above and beyond. He remember what we ordered the last time! Even though his serving skill is in beginner stage , his memory toward customer is a great asset for the restaurant ! Later on I overheard, he also remember what the other customer ordered last time , that customer was shock and impressed!. Great for both table and sushi bar experience . But honeslty the price is high. Considering the location is beside a Tim Horton and a supermarket .. reason giving 3/5 star. This chef is experienced therefore it's his choice to charge such high price ....but honeslty this is not downtown... aoyama in a getto Plaza , food is excellent the price is way less ."}
{"text":"I saw someone on my Facebook come here and realized how close it was to my parents place so I went with my mom to give it a try.   The decor was nice , restaurant was quite small (I think their space use to be a Popeyes). I heard it's authentic Japanese food, so was expecting quite the tastebuds. I didn't get that much out of the tastebuds (just look at the pictures) but my wallet sure did.   I ended up paying $90 for 2 people (called 2 dinner sets $20 each, 9 pieces of salmon sashimi for a whopping $30, plus tax and tips). I will admit, I am at fault in a way as I haven't looked at the price of the salmon sashimi (aka \"Sake\") but having been to other Japanese restaurants, I honest to God didn't think it cost me an arm and a leg after I put in the order. The dinner set was a good deal as it came with rice, soup and salad. However, they really should reprice their menu.   $30 for 9 pieces of small salmon sashimi ?!! I pay literally $30cash at Seoul Banchan for 55 pieces and its fresher than a baby's butt. AND I'm full and I can feed at least 4 people with it.   I'm sorry but this isn't a downtown location , they are located beside a Tim Hortons and close to a FreshCo, it makes no sense to charge this much, authentic or not, that's not even important. I'm still in shock of how expensive it was, no Japanese restaurant in Richmond Hill have I been to charges this kind of price.  Parking: Easy Price: overpriced sashimi, dinner set was okay, nothing you can't get at other restaurants though.  Service: Good  Clean: Yes  Would go again?: No. I'll stick with my favourite sushi take out place instead. Seriously, go order from Seoul Banchan and you will know exactly what I mean and why I felt the way I did with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food!! After experiencing a bad service from a so-called fine dining Japanese restaurant in downtown (which is actually run by Korean now), I finally got a chance to go to a real one. I have ordered the sushi course, though it's a little bit pricy, it's well worth it. Totally feel the freshness of the food!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place and we decided to give it a try and it's fair to say that it exceeded our expectations! We both ordered the toshi course for $85. It is on the pricey side but we left more than satisfied.  The meal started with a very simple salad of seaweed and vermicelli. Very refreshing and a great way to get the appetite going. That was followed by the sashimi platter. I was very surprised by the quality of the salmon! Too bad it only came with one piece. Then came the two appetizers. Not sure if it's the same every time. One of them was a concoction of salmon roe and uni. Delicious and fresh! That was followed by two pieces of melt in your mouth foie gras sushi and a nicely seasoned pan seared cod paired with a tuna cake. To finish off, the sushi and maki platter. All of it was very very fresh. The chef had already put the right amount of wasabi in them and all that was needed was a light dip in soy sauce. The rice in the sushi also deserves a mention. A small bowl of noodles and dessert finished off the meal. Though tasty, the highlight was the sushi. We truly did enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Quiet and clean environment. Fresh and delicate sushi. Delicious chewanmushi.  Light and fluffy tempura. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Bayview/Major Mack area. The food was good and atmosphere cozy. Had the Toshi course meal for $85. Lot of food. Shared with my husband with additional plates (soft shell crab and ox tongue). Overall a bit pricey but I appreciate the good taste. Would not go for staple dining but would definitely go again for \"treat\"."}
{"text":"The restaurant is decorated nicely. I found out many customers like to sit at the sushi bar when I passed by and it looks like they are also serving izakaya. As I was directed to sit at the booth, I found that the sitting booth is tight, not much space and I could not sit comfortably.   Shortly after we ordered the sushi dinner set, the sashimi came first followed by the sea urchin (uni) + salmon roe + rice and then the foie gras sushi. The food came very quickly and I was hoping they would put a pause.   Sashimi dish, the fish were fresh and it was not bad.  Sea urchin (uni) + salmon roe + rice, the salmon roe has overwhelmed the taste of the sea urchin. I would rather to have sea urchin with the rice alone.  Foie gras sushi came third. Since we were still working on the first dish, we didn't dig in on this dish. Shortly after, the waitress came to our table and said we should eat the foie gras sushi prior to sashimi and the Sea urchin (uni) + salmon roe + rice. I was thinking if that has to eat immediately when it's still warm, either slow down the speed of serving the dish or wait until we were done with the first two dishes. Taste is not bad but not outstanding neither.  Tofu with shrimp, I like this appetizer the best. The soup at the bottom of the tofu tastes delicious and then it is layered with slices of mint leaf and then topped with the shrimp. The mint flavour blends well with the tofu and the shrimp.  Eggplant with cod fish and deep fried fish paste tastes good also, especially the eggplant is soaked in sweet miso sauce.  Bowl of noodles, I found the texture of the noodles are on the hard side. They could cook a bit longer.  Duck Breast stuffed with spinach, the duck tastes alright. I just don't understand why would the chef wants to stuff the duck breast with spinach since spinach does not carry a strong or contrasting taste.   Next time if I go again, I would want to try their izakaya instead."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese sushi restaurant with a bit of a modern take. Love the fois gras sushi! The rice is amazing. Would definitely come back. The place is small so definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"Very fresh. Hidden gem in Richmond hill The $85 omakase is really filling. Worth the money"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars (2 for food, .5 for service)   Toshi Ryoriten is indeed an authentic Japanese restaurant in that it's Japanese run and the food is fairly traditional. But just because it's run by Japanese people doesn't mean it's good!   The food and product is fine, as was the wait staff. I went there and ordered the Toshi Course ($85). It began okay, though when I pay this kind of money for food I expect more than just food, I expect an experience. This restaurant never got there. My first course, sashimi, was handed to me nonchalantly by one of the sushi chefs and he didn't bother explaining to me what the different fish were on the plate. I also noticed that they're using cheap wasabi that you can find at any other lower-price point sushi place.   The server bringing me the cooked courses was nicer, making sure to explain what each course was. I enjoyed the eggplant in the black cod/eggplant/tempura'd pepper plate.   I'm used to going to omakase places around the city like Zen and Shoushin and I expect a certain minimum experience (call me a snob) in that the chef understands stuff like timing the meal and not serving too fast or too slow so that the patron can eat at a gentle pace and enjoy themselves. Normally, at places like this you sit at the sushi bar and the chef serves you piece by piece.   Maybe the chef didn't like that I was taking photos or something, but it honestly felt like he was trying to serve me as fast as humanly possible, laying down multiple pieces in front of me before I had even finished the former without even bothering to explain what each piece was. I felt incredibly rushed, I'd pick up one piece and before even putting in my mouth there would already be another nigiri on my plate ready to go. There was no time to savour or think about each piece, because he was not planning on stopping. He'd plop a piece down and immediately start work on the next piece over and over again -- if I hadn't eaten as fast as I could it felt like he'd have just loaded my entire plate with his course so he could get me out of there!  Note that unlike the usual omakase experience, the rice was too warm, and he doesn't usually season the neta and recommends you put it in their house soy sauce. Omakase literally means \"I leave it to you\", and you are entrusting the chef with everything, including how he feels the fish is best eaten. It's lazy (IMO) to not take that extra step but I do understand his perspective on this at least (leaving it to customer discretion).   At the end of the day I was in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour. Won't be going back, stick to Zen or Shoushin... even Kiu was better."}
{"text":"This is easiest one of my favorite omakase restaurant for 3 reasons:  1. Reasonable price 2. Location 3. Fresh ingredients  My friend and I came here one winter night after a heavy snowfall and found ourselves the only patrons for a solid couple of hours. Definitely an incredible feeling to be enjoying sushi one piece at a time with no other distraction around. Like any other great omakase style restaurant, each piece gets better and better and they just simply melt in your mouth.  We got the privilege of getting to know the chef as well since he was only serving us. He's been in the business for more than 20 years and had worked along side chef Kaji (from sushi Kaji). And he named his restaurant after his son - Toshi, which has been opened for about 2/3 years now (Living in the area for 10 years and I felt i have missed out on dining at Toshi.) So I need to rectify this, it will become my mission to visit Toshi once a quarter to make up for lost time!  Oh P.S. Foie gras sushi is part of the omakase course. It was so buttery and delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice Omakase restaurant uptown (you don't find much of good omakase menus in richmondhill/markham area).  They offer 2 omakase menus: Sushi course - $65 Toshi course - $85  We ordered the sushi course which was more than enough for the 2 of us. We couldn't finish and had to pack the rest home.  You get 12 pieces of chef choice sushi, a small soba noodle bowl and a bunch of small appetizers.  My favorite pieces for the whole night must have been the foie gras sushi and the cute little uni bowl. The sushi/fish was very fresh, and everything tasted good and your meal ends with a little creme bruleé dessert.  Overall i would recommend this restaurant if you are craving for a nice omakase meal around the uptown area."}
{"text":"Not worth it !! Pricy and food is so so.    Service is ok and environment is great.   Won't come back.  Pork Japanese curry $17.5 lunch is the worst!!  Very Small portion with lots of sauce and rice.   Tempura is ok."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review with the fact that the day we were dining that we were in a rush so it was not the best was to experience this restaurant.    The interior had a mixed vibe between somewhat traditional but with a whole modern take. The interior stands out without being too in your face. It provided a relaxed feel but with a sense of wow they spent moment on this look.   The food was really good. My partner had a craving for soba noodles and got nabeyaki with soba noodles (you can pick between soba and udon). The broth was delicious. The noodles had the right amount of bite and a good flavour that good soba does. The poached egg was well done and the only flaw was the tempura sitting in the soup. That last critique is more a personal preference of not having something well fried in a soup but the dish overall was delicious. I got the Chirashi (one of my go to's at any Japanese or sushi style restaurant if they have it). It was good the fish was fresh and the overall flavour was good. Wouldn't say that the value was there for the size or the amount of food but again this is the kinda restaurant you're paying for quality over quantity.   The service was great and the server was able to close out our check before the food got there so we could leave after the meal. Would love to come back and try the food more earnestly next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were extremely excited to see a new Japanese restaurant uptown as good quality sushi is hard to find. The service was quite attentive, although the food was very mediocre. We went mostly for the a la carte sushi menu, and we were very disappointed. For the ones we tried, the price point for a piece of sushi ranged from around $3-6. We were expecting the quality to be similar to Aoyama, one of our absolute favorite sushi joints. However it was far from that standard. The texture of the rice was too hard, and the soy sauce was too salty. The quality of the fresh ingredients weren't bad, but they definitely need to work on the rice and soy sauce. We also ordered the spider roll, and it was another huge disappointment. It was more AYCE quality than what you would expect at an \"authentic\" Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Toronto. If you order teriyaki salmon at japanese restaurants this place is NOT for you. The quality of their sushi is at par with zen and yazu without being pretentious and the hefty price tag. They have omakase menu but I like to sit at the sushi bar and order from their a la carte menu so I can choose what I want and leave room for seconds and also have small conversations with Mori. Don't forget to get the foie gras sushi - take my word."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I'm hesitant to give this restaurant 4 stars at this point, but it's definitely 3.5 stars at least. With the new grand opening, this restaurant is a gem that may be something great!  First things first is that you have to know that this restaurant is set up to be something on the higher end. With their beautiful decor and design, to the set up and pricing on the menu, you will want to come here for a special occasion, rather than just another night out for dinner. When I say beautiful decor and design, I actually mean stunning. Each section of the restaurant was well thought out and planned, from the walls to the table tops.  The menu did scare me a little with their pricing rather high, but when the food arrived, it was a little more justifiable. Everything was plated gorgeously and it all tasted phenomenal. My friend and I decided to go for the Toshi Course and add in a Kamoyaki as well. The overall course had a nice transition from plate to plate, and each one was distinct in its flavor palate. From the sashimi and foie gras/uni starters, to the perfectly grilled cod, everything was made with delicate detail and perfection. Honestly some of the best grilled cod I have ever had! It was literally so soft that it felt like it was melting in my mouth! The beauty of the Toshi Course was that it consisted of the chef's choice of fish and seafood that was fresh and in season. That means that it would be different each time you go, and would give you something to look forward to.   With this specific course at $85 before tax, there was quite a high expectation on the meal and overall experience. The food was amazing to eat, but there wasn't quite enough food to share with more than one other person. I believe that it is actually set-up for one person, which would make it quite a hefty price for in my opinion.  The part of the experience that was rather lacking would be the service, unfortunately. For a higher end restaurant, there is a bar of expectation that I would have wanted to be met. Although the servers were extremely friendly and nice to the bone, the overall service itself was slow. Now, I understand that 'nicer' restaurants want you to enjoy the food and experience, but this was something different. They took a little too long to come take our order, get us more tea, and had to be asked multiple times to get something for us. Wasn't as bad as they were very nice, but I kind of expect more attention when I'm paying a certain price for the food/service.  With all that being said, great food is something I am willing to spend money on from time to time, so I can see myself coming back in the future. Most likely for a more specific occasion, but it may be worth it for that."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very fresh fish! Love the ambience as well, their omakase are more reasonable priced compare to the other sushi places in Toronto.   Would recommend this place to anyone lives or nearby that area."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Japanese restaurant with chef who used to work at Sushi Kaji, there is no way this can be bad, right? Wrong.   Ordered the Chirashi deluxe which is $50 (although it shows $40 on the menu posted on the outside window). When it came, I thought they had made a mistake as the bowl was very small and the sashimi pieces were so thin. As I was eating the \"crab\" meat, thinking it has to be real crab meat if they charge $50 for this, but amazingly it was the fake stuff that they sell at those Chinese grocery places.   Even more surprisingly, I found sharp fish bone in the sashimi, not good.   When I thought this couldn't go worse, I got the bill and noticed that they raised the price of the chriashi to $60. I complained to the waiter and he said they are in the midst of making changes to the menu hence the mistake. He eventually deducted the price back to $50. If these guys are thinking of charging this dish for $60 in the future, they must be off their bonkers.  Sorry but this will be the last time I am visiting this place."}
{"text":"Came here 4 times in one month. I absolutely LOVE  this place. Came twice for lunch and twice for dinner. Im a creature of habit so I like to stick to what I've tried and liked. Had the chirashi and tempura for both lunches and had the sushi course omakase for both dinners.   For $16, the chirashi is totally worth it! The Sushi rice is warm and sweet and I was impressed with the quality of fish on top. The tempura is one of the better ones I've had in the gta. The batter is light and crispy and doesn't have that over used oil taste.   On a side note, don't come here expecting large slabs of fish on rice like you would at an ayce joint. You get quality over quantity here.   The omakase sushi course for $65 was well worth the money. If you compare it to other omakase restaurants in the gta, you're going to be dishing out at least $100+/person. The tsukidashi dish they give you really reminds me of the food I had in Japan. My first visit, it came with chawanmushi. The egg was soft and melted in your mouth and it had pieces of meat, spinach and mushrooms inside.  The second time I visited, the tsukidashi was a delicious broth with a fried taro ball, chicken meatball and pumpkin. The flavour of the taro and chicken were to die for. I didn't want this to end.   The foie gras and uni sushi were the obvious standout pieces, but the other one were delicious and fresh. The only one I really disliked was the Bonita I received on my second visit.   The hot soba is the perfect end to this meal (before dessert). It had crispy pieces of tempura bits and nori with sliced up spinach and enoki mushrooms. I love hot soba and was so happy to see this on the menu.   The dessert was a pudding of some sort topped with a strawberry and whipped cream. It was really light and ended the meal on a light note. I like the fact that I don't feel like a beast after eating Japanese food.   I will definitely be coming here over and over to satisfy my sushi craving."}
{"text":"Toshi Ryoriten is a quaint upscale Japanese restaurant that puts an emphasis on quality.  If you're looking for sushi you'll be paying a pretty penny but you'll be treated to traditional high quality sushi.  My sister and I shared the large sushi dinner combo ($85) along with a few sides.  The fish was fresh and some expensive cuts are included.  The rice elevated the sushi to a different level.  Good authentic sushi puts an emphasis on the rice and Toshi Ryoriten's rice made me feel like I was back in Japan.  The rice was well seasoned and soft in texture (without being mushy).  Fantastic!  The other dishes were also good but the sushi was by far the highlight of my dinner.  The waiting staff were all extremely professional and I love when the sushi chefs greet you and thank you for coming.  Overall, I had an amazing dining experience.  Even though the bill ended up over $150 for the two of us and neither of us were full, you're really paying for a fantastic traditional Japanese meal."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday afternoon for lunch. Cute cozy modern Japanese decor. Got the 27 dollar special lunch box & sashimi lunch. On the side ordered two handrolls. The standouts were the tempura and miso soup - very fresh and hot! Burnt my tongue actually haha. Handroll i would pass - nothing special and the eel i got was fishy. The sashimi was nothing special. Overall on the pricer side. I heard good reviews about their omakase but didnt get a chance to try. Overall decent experience."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Japanese restaurant in uptown. Now this's a good choice instead going all the way to downtown. Small dishes but all high quality!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic Japanese restaurant in Markham!  As with most authentic Japanese sushi restaurants, it is a bit pricy and service is a bit slow.  They also have tapas dishes like an izakaya, however this place has more of a traditional restaurant feel to it.  We tried the following dishes: Gomaae ($5) - their Gomaee is marinated pretty well with sesame, peanut, and soy, however it came out ice cold.  There was actually ice bits in it - It must've been stored in the back of a cold fridge!  That being said, since it was near frozen and premade, it took over 15 minutes to come to the table.  Gyoza ($7.50) - Althought expensive, the gyozas are good.  Fried just right so the skin is crispy, and the meat stuffing was marinated well.  Nasudengaku ($8) - This fried eggplant dish is highly recommended - I don't think I've had it better at any other izakayas!  The miso sauce was light and the eggplant was cooked through with great texture, just the way I like it!  Ika Sugatayaki ($10) - This is grilled calamari.  The portion is large compared to the other tapas dishes.  However, was a bit dry  Sauteed Scallops & Asparagus ($9.50) - This dish was a supreme disappointment.  Stay away from this one!  The scallops were very mushy and overly cooked in butter.  Usually don't say this, but there was too much butter.  But the quality of the scallops was very bad and the dish was small, although I wouldn't want to eat more.  Udon Tempura ($17.50) - This is from the lunch menu.  As a tip, you can order noodles from the lunch menu, just add $3 to the price for each.  The udon was typical, nothing special.  The tempura however was really, really good!  Two shrimp tempura were melt in your mouth.  Also came with a pumpkin tempura, eggplant tempura, and broccoli tempura.  Rolls (Spider Roll: $10 - 6 pieces) (California Roll: $7.50/6 pieces) (Dynamite Roll: $8.50/5 pieces) - The rolls here are excellent!  It must be the sushi rice, as it is sweeter and lighter than the rice used at your typical Korean/Chinese run sushi restaurant.  You can really taste a difference!  Also, must be a different brand/quality of seaweed paper.  When at full capacity, the two waitresses here can't keep up.  The service was very very slow.  However, despite the slow service, I will come back.  The dishes that were good were really good.  I'll know what to steer clear of next time.  By the way, green Tea is free here."}
{"text":"May 2018 Since the dining experience  has improved as indicated from my last review below, so my other half wanna give it a try on her own the next day...and boy oh boy, what a disappointment. The sashimi cost $22 for 7 piece of fish. Go see the pic and judge for yourself... don't know what to say any more...  -------------- May 2018 Visited again tonite. Ordered the sushi course for $65. Service has improved and food comes in a timely manner where I don't need to wait long for the food. Either they have improved or they do better when there are less people in the restaurant. :)  3.5 star , added 0.5 star from last time ---------  For this restaurant, I think it's ok, but not extraordinary either, specially when you factored in the price.  Service- The service is not the kind of friendly service you would expect to get from restaurant run by Japanese. It just doesnt feel friendly for some reason, and I do have to wait a long time for getting my tea refilled, to place my orders or getting the bill. So service is average, for this price range.   Food - The sushi or the fish used is better than typical sushi place and it's good,  so I am ok to pay the sushi in their price range. They do taste fresh and have fish taste, which I like! What I dont like is their choice of Wasabi, it tasted like the kind you will get from the all you can eat restaurant. I mean, I don't expect I will get the freshly grated one like you get from Zen or Shoushin, but not these ones that looks like clay. I think it's actually ruin the sushi in a way. I think Michi use better wasabi than this place. Again, it's just my preference and maybe you dont care much about wasabi. :)  Personally, if I am going to order 12-14 piece of sushi, I probably would prefer to pay an extra $10 to $15 more and go to Zen instead. But this place is located closer to where I live, so I will go there again."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I heard a new authentic Japanese restaurant had opened up in Richmond Hill. So of course being the Japanese foodie lover that I am I, I totally had to go try it out! Now in my tests I usually like to go for the basics, but they had a very limited menu. I looked at both the lunch and dinner.   So we'll start with the standard miso soup and salad.  The miso, was very basic white miso mixed with water. No bonito flavour.  The salad dressing was served on the side and I think that's in house made with a hint of yuzu flavour made the salad very fresh and refreshing.   Now for basics I usually like to order a serving of the agedashi tofu (deep fried tofu) since that wasn't on the menu, we ordered the tempura, a sushi and a sashimi lunch.  The tempura was light and not too oily. Excellent.  The fish was very fresh and they served it in various styles. Torched and fresh.  Prices were a little steep but considering the area I guess it's acceptable.   In other reviews it mentions slow service, however we received quite excellent and quick service.   We will definitely go back to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"***The rating is for 3.5 stars***  So I decided to give this place a try after reading other Yelper's visit. Toshi Ryoriten got really nice decor. And I agree with other posts, finally a Japanese places uptown!   Let's start off with venue, it is very nicely decorated and very clean. At the entrance has this classic Japanese style wooden door like motif. And once you get inside is more modern and nicely lit.   Onto the food... Not bad, not too over powering in terms of flavour. My friend and I ordered a marinated cod (Gindara), spicy salmonl, yellow-tail and green onion (Negihamachi) plus rainbow rolls plus the shiitake mushroom stuffed with surimi shrimp paste (Shiitake Shinjo). The food aren't bad, as I mentioned the flavour isn't overpowering. The fish was quite fresh. And the texture of the rice does have certain authentic Japanese sushi rice taste.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is casual and not too loud, where one can have a conversation with a date. The servers aren't bad, they tend to me as often as they could given the busy schedule they have."}
{"text":"if you want good Sushi there are many other restaurant to venture into, but if you want somthin great and doesn't want to fly to Japan, this is the place for you.  I have been visiting GTO's Japanese restaurant for 30 years, and this chef is by far the best in Toronto.  Chef Toshi san is friendly and attentive, always kine on making sure customers having good time.  one of the important job for sushi is to present sushi in correct time.  This chef will put the best sushi in perfect timing.  The rice's acidity, texture, mold, consistency, everything is simply perfect.  I can go on and on about every single details about this place, but it better left for yourself to experience.    I say finally we have a real sushi chef in Richmond Hill, enjoy!"}
{"text":"3.5* Authentic Japanese, fast and polite service, but I'm not used to paying the premium in 905. Hubby took me there for a weekday lunch. He ordered the Sashimi lunch (I forget the actual name) and I had a Spicy Tuna Roll, a Dynamite Roll and a Chawan Mushi (steamed egg appetizer).  Kudos to the waitress for taking my Chawan Mushi order even though it was not on the lunch menu. And it was very well made, right down to the hint of orange zest. I savoured every bit of it.   Sashimi and the rolls were also fresh and delicious, was surprised that the Spicy Tuna came in whole pieces inside the sushi, not chopped up (do all high-end Japanese places serve Spicy Tuna pieces inside the rolls?)  Washroom was clean and parking was ample. But I'm not planning a second visit coz the bill is too steep for my lifestyle, although I have a feeling the Chawan Mushi would be calling my name..."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5  W0oOooOOOOOOHOOooOOO! I finally got to eat here!!  *cue hallelujah music* After many months, I VIVIAN, HAVE SET FOOT INTO THIS RESTAURANT. CAN I GET A WAYYOOOOHH??!  LOL anyways yeah. I was thrilled because I love Japanese food and I have read many good reviews on this place. Also, I heard this place is run by Japanese people which is AWESOME!  I feel like it's quite rare to find Japanese restaurants that are ACTUALLY owned by Japanese people around Richmond Hill. It's like trying to find a shiny pokemon out in the wild. SUPE R DUPER HARD AND RARE!!  Alrighty, enough of the chit chat. Let's just get RIGHT INTO THE FOOD PORTION. I got the Nabeyaki. That's actually all I got.  It was like $16.50. I'm not rich enough to afford anything else after that like nope. It's basically a noodle soup (you have the choice to choose between soba or udon; I chose soba) traditionally served in a clay pot. It came with a variety of different tempuras (shrimp, sweet potato, broccoli, and eggplant), a poached egg, a few chicken meat pieces, and I believe spinach. THIS WAS SO GOOD! Like wow. I BURNED THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH BUT ITS ALL GOOD. NO WORRIES CAUSE WHEN THERE\"S GOOD FOOD IT DOESN\"T EVEN MATTER IF YOUR MOUTH IS ON FIRE. Jokes, but forreal I literally couldn't stop smiling. Now that I think about it, the soup actually tastes really similar to satoimo nimono (its kind of like a stewed taro).  **okay i just found out that both recipes uses practically the same ingredients SO YAY I COULD MAKE THIS AT HOME CHEF VIVIAN IS BACK IN BUSINESS!#!!  Although, it tasted really good, the price was not good. I feel like if there was maybe seafood or whatever, it should cost that much, but considering the fact that these are relatively cheap ingredients, I would say it should be cheaper. But that's just my opinion of course. Oh yeah, maybe it's just my monstrous appetite, but I wasn't EXACTLY full.   **more side notes: i did not like how soggy my tempura got (its kinda gross ya feel me) and i think for the $16.50, they could throw in a small bowl of rice (it would complement the leftover soup so well i think ;'D)  Overall, good restaurant with nice decor, good nabeyaki (even though its my first time trying this, its still the bomb.com), and relatively nice service. Despite all that and the rating, I don't necessarily think I would come back. With that $16.50, I could've walked to Yummy Sushi (which is like diagonally across from this place? ITS CLOSE BY OK) and ate to my heart's content. I would probably even have a bit of money left over and get myself a god damn donut too. LOOL But yeah, still worth a try."}
{"text":"this place is a hidden gem. finally something tastes like what you have in downtown or even better. although it's a bit pricy, the quality is so good. totally worth it. i will definiately come back."}
{"text":"Really good food. One of the best omakase I have had in Toronto. Really cool vibe as well. The sushi chef is a lot of fun"}
{"text":"My friends brought me to Toshi Ryoriten for dinner and we decided to try their Omakase set! We went here on a weeknight so the restaurant had a lot of room. One thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant has limited seating. I'd suggest that you book a table in advance instead of walk-ins. Service was excellent.  We ordered the Tsukidashi sushi course, the highlights were: * Gomaae (Boiled green bean or spinach with sesame sauce) - a must-get at Japanese restaurants, one of my favourite light appetizers! * Seared Foie Gras Nigiri - That foie gras melt though! Yummy! * Uni x Fish Roe - The uni was fresh and it paired nicely with the big fish roe bits. * Small noodle bowl - It was light and tasty, a clear broth to cleanse your palette."}
{"text":"Came here twice now and tried different items so here is an overall recap of my experience:  First impression of the place was a big thumbs up. The decor is beautiful - I love the marble slab behind the sushi bar. The staff is very friendly and greeted us with a warm welcome. Both times I chose to eat at the sushi bar in order to watch the chef prepare our meals.   Food-wise, I tried several things including their signature set meal (be prepared to spend some $$$ for that omakase experience foodies!). Here are some of the most memorable dishes:  - Foie Gras Sushi:: It's a no brainer that this would catch your attention - regardless if whether or not you are a fan of the fatty delicacy. The chef torches the protein first before he serves it to you and the process is gorgeous & mouthwatering. Rich in flavour and texture, it is a dish I recommend you try for yourself.   - Marinated Salmon Sushi:: A flavourful dish to be sure. A tad too salty for my taste but it definitely made my taste buds happy :)  - Toshi Course:: while the price may give you a start, believe me when I say I feel that it was worth it. Chef's choice of fresh sashimis and sushis is a must and those were definitely well chosen pieces of fish being served to us. One of the courses includes unagi wrapped in tofu wrapped in seaweed and deep fried, served with unagi sauce -- this was incredibly delicious. Plated to impress, each course was a treat for the eyes and mouth alike. I walked away with a very full belly and a smile on my face :)   Why not 5 stars? I feel like there is still room for improvement on the quality of the dishes. Then again, this is a new business and so I look forward to coming back again to try more dishes prepared by their chef."}
{"text":"I found this to be overpriced with small portions in an equally small dining room.  Although the quality of the food is good, better value can be found elsewhere.  The $85 Toshi dinner simply wasn't worth the price.  Service is friendly, but can be quite slow, especially the restaurant is busy.   Furthermore, expect to pay $10 extra if you wish to bring in your own birthday cake in."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment, unfortunately. While the service was super friendly and helpful, the food was surprisingly subpar. We had the chirashi, which was excellent, and the $85 toshi set, which cost far too much considering what we got. The 7 pieces of sashimi were the smallest, saddest pieces of sashimi we've ever seen at an a la carte sushi place, and some of the fish, in the sashimi and the nigiri sushi, were not very fresh looking or tasting. The two appetizers were not good either, and absolutely tiny. In the end, we paid about $170 for two, and we both felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had their special lunch with sushi, sashimi and tempura on my first visit; the tempura wasn't crunchy and the sashimi were cut too thin.  Opted for the sushi bar menu on my second visit and everything was delish.  Their foie gras was so creamy and buttery; they just melted in your mouth.  Slow service tho!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this restaurant through friends and reviews, so I finally had to go try it myself and it was so good! We heard the omakase was very good, but we wanted to try some items off the menu for our first visit. Here is what we ordered: Spider Roll, Foie Gras Sushi, Tempura Dinner, and Chirashi Deluxe. The Spider Roll which has soft crab shell in it, was very mediocre. So don't think we will be ordering maki in our future visit. I have had Foie Gras Sushi at other Japanese restaurants, but this one was the best! A must order! Torched perfectly and just melts in your mouth. The Tempura Dinner was very good. Everything was nicely battered and great portions. It came with 6 pieces of shrimps, and a good variety of vegetables like mushrooms, taro, eggplant, yam, and zucchini. I would also highly recommend the Chirashi Deluxe, the sashimi was so fresh and so much variety. There was salmon, toro, uni, amber jack, roe, unagi, octopus, shrimp, and more! Also the sushi rice was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. So happy to have an authentic Japanese restaurant in the 905. I heard the Chef trained Sushi Kaji.I would have given it a 5 if the roll was a little better and they used fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"I can't believe how much I have just paid for the food in this restaurant. So I decided to sign up on yelp for writing a review. Two stars are for the decor and environment. But the food is WAY overpriced here, considering how small the portion it is. I was shocked to see the buck wheat noodle which I was paying $16 for. Everything here is like appetizer size and so expensive. I definitely will not come back again."}
{"text":"Finally!!  A place in York Region that has genuinely delicious sashimi!  Came here without a reservation and the lady was kind enough, on a weekend to give us a reserved table as long as we could give it back by 7 pm (we came at around 5 pm that day).    We ordered one toshi course to share and it was absolutely incredible.  I haven't had such fresh fish in a long time.  However, one of our courses, the sushi, came with way too much wasabi and it essentially washed out the fish flavour, which I was disappointed about.  The unagi wapped in tofu and seaweed was extremely delicious.    We ended up also trying their spider roll, which was also good but was actually pretty small. We ended up ordering another cooked dish, which ended up being good as well (unfortunately, I've now forgotten what it was...so clearly it wasn't too memorable).    But if you're looking for high quality fish, this would definitely be the place to go.  I think I'll tell them to hold off on the wasabi for my sushi next time.  As for their other izakaya dishes, they are also good but I would probably just come here for fish in the future.    Service wise, it was a bit slow but we never felt rushed despite only having the table until 7.  I think we were actually more antsy about the fact that we had to give the table back then they were :)."}
{"text":"The aesthetics here are great but the food is ALRIGHT at best.   We got the sushi course for $75 (doesn't indicate for how many people but I think it's for two..) which included:  -seasonal appetizer  -chefs choice 10 piece sushi + one hand roll  -small noodles bowl (unappetizing lol) -dessert (it's alright)  We also got:  -spider roll (not good) -rainbow roll (best of the three) -dynamite roll (meh)   My 3 stars is for the nice customer service and sashimi which was actually decently fresh and good! Aside from that, I don't think I'll be returning... I know it's tapas style but it just didn't seem worth it for the unimpressive sushi. We wanted to order more since we were still hungry but there wasn't enough stuff on the menu that we wanted to try. If you're already sitting at the restaurant, I would say to just load up on the sashimi and get the sea urchin!"}
{"text":"Authentically made sushi, great service and fair price!   The restaurant is divided into two sections, we sat in front of the sushi chefs so I didn't get a chance to see the other part.   We had the Toshi Course  - Two Seasonal Appetizer Dishes - Sashimi (7pcs) - Chef Choice of 12pcs of Nigiri Sushi + One Roll (Fresh fish selection of the day) - Small Noodles Bowl - Dessert  And also ordered Gindara (marinated cod in saikyo miso).   The sashimi and sushi was exceptional, and pace of the dinner was perfect. The fish was fresh and melted in your mouth. I would definitely recommend this to people who like testing out different types of fish, not recommended for picky eaters. We shared the meal but it was mainly made for one person as there's only one dessert and one bowl of noodles.   The marinated cod was cooked well, but I felt wasn't worth the price as the portion was quite small. It was light despite the dish being more on the oily side.  The dessert was a green tea ice cream with red bean, lychee jello and fruits."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday as a party of 4 and was very impressed. I would give this place a solid 4.5. I booked to have dinner at the sushi bar since some of us wanted the omakase sushi set. The first impressions were great, interior is modern with Japanese touches, the serve ware premium quality, we were given warm towels & a free side dish shortly after. 2 of us ordered the omakase, one ordered the sushi course ($65), the other the toshi course ($85). We also ordered a tempura dinner, salmon dinner and a yellowtail sashimi. All the sashimi were wonderful quality, very fresh and was soft. The foie gras sushi is lightly torched and rich. I felt the toshi course wasn't worth the extra $20 as you only get 1 sashimi plate and a cold meat plate extra. The yellowtail we ordered was a lot better than the course sashimi, so I think for $20 you could opt for things you'd enjoy more. The soba with the course was delightful and a nice touch...makes up for the small portions in Omakase courses. The tempura however has a lot of room for improvement, the batter was thicker and like a beer batter hybrid. I do appreciate their use of lotus root and green beans, you don't see those in tempura form. The dessert with the sushi courses was a sakura mochi. It was authentic and yummy."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday on a week night. There were a decent amount of people dining which is always a good sign. We were sat at the sushi bar where we got to watch the sushi chef work his magic. I believe he was the owner and he was great. Very engaging and entertaining. We both ordered the \"Toshi\" set which turned out to be quite a lot of sashimi, sushi and little side dishes. By the end I was stuffed! All the fish was super fresh and beautifully sliced, the sushi was delicious- especially the torched foie gras! If I'm ever in the area again I will definitely be heading back for more. 5 STARS"}
{"text":"Toshi Ryoriten is the rare authentic Japanese restaurant in York Region. It is expensive, but mostly worth it. I had dinner at Toshi late week and fortunately the restaurant was empty. The owner is probably not glad for it, but I prefer fast service and we received it. The waiter and waitress were attentive. There is not a quality check, but they are politely observing you and attentive to your needs.  The menu offers sushi, cooked food and combination sets. The omakase (chef's seasonal choice) sets are either a $65 or $85 course. I had the $65 course and was offered a uni and ikura appetizer (fantastic), a series of sushis (salmon, tai, toro, anago, shimaaji, kanpachi, etc. the star of which was their exclusive foie gras which was literally melt-in-your-mouth), a soba noodle bowl and a red bean jelly dessert. The fish is tasty and expertly cut, the rice is superb and the chef has a couple of techniques up his sleeve that clearly work. Everything was either good or excellent, but the sushi was superlative, while the cooked items were just good. For those who want to order bentos and items like Teriyaki, etc. Toshi has a good menu selection as well.  The washroom and restaurant was clean. I am not sure why they have the braids at the entrance, but it is irrelevant what the place looks like when the sushi is this good and the staff are polite. The restaurant shares a typically ugly and bland suburban plaza with the likes of Price chopper and Tim Hortons, which is the usual I gues.  Toshi, a transplant of downtown, is joining Inaho, Miyabi and Zen as authentic sushi restaurants north of Steeles and that is a very good thing!  I wish they would lower their prices a tad so it becomes more of a restaurant one can visit often, but they are still cheaper than Zen and Yasu a tad and mostly just as good."}
{"text":"The interior of this place is stunning, but the food isn't as impressive. The sushi rolls were wrapped so loosely they were falling apart and the sashimi was sliced so thin I was questioning whether it was really 3 pieces. I did like the scallops though. The staff here is extremely nice, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my wife. We both thinks the sashimi there's excellent, fresh and authentic. Price point is fair. We ordered a Sashimi lunch, Chirashi Lunch. I initially thought I'd come out hungry but there was enough food to fill me up. Great experience and food overall."}
{"text":"A hidden jewel in RH/ Markham... Good food and reasonable $$... Enjoyed this place better than the new one on Enterprise Blvd..."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends last week. We chose to order à la carte instead omakase because we want to share and try different food. Overall, good quality sushi and sashimi but is not WOW (no more BC uni for now and the other one cost $36 for 1 piece). The restaurant is really comfy and relaxing but the lighting is really dim and is not great for taking pictures. I will probably just come here after a while but not often.  PRICE FOR TOTAL: $180"}
{"text":"The sushi option is great! Ordered the sushi course which had foie, scallop, toro, lobster, unagi, squid, salmon, manguro, hamachi, and snapper. All of sushi had the proper rice portion and proper temperature. The appetizer was also amazing. Uni and IKura rice, pork belly and radish, and soba noodle soup. The dessert was plum wine jelly.  Other ala cart order was miso eggplant and fried oyster both were good.   Just a comment I wish server said what sushi was which is the usual protocol for sushi that is chef choice.   On the pricier side, bill with tip +1 beer =$120"}
{"text":"This is honestly my favourite sushi place in toronto... How am I only discovering it after 4 years?!   Sat at the sushi bar, chef greeted us warmly when we arrive. Service was good, food was good and even the dessert and sake was good too!   Fish I love (lighter, less fat) 1) Shima aji 2) Kanpachi 3) Hamachi  either sashimi or sushi 4) The Hamachi grilled neck (didn't see it on the menu but asked the waiter for grilled fish - VERY GOOD- I only ate the boneless part and it was heavenly)   Food I think its ok but this place made it great  1) Toro (Normally I don't really like toro cuz its fat but this place has the perfect sized sushi and sashimi! Can't complain!!) 2) foie gras sushi (a pile of fat that melts in your mouth : )) 3) BANANA fried - i meant tempura ( :o very very good and not oily and heavy like most places ive tried)  4) pudding  The sweetness is just right for me to not waste any food   Things I feel ok about  1) Could have less soggy seaweed on the side for the ikura (salmon roe? fish eggs. ) But maybe that's the way to have it what do i know  2) Agedashi tofu - tastes different (or actually better- tofu was soooo soft and hot on the inside) from the usual less authentic places but I'm kinda used to that inauthentic taste 3) grilled ika (squid)- a bit too hard for my liking (braces suck)   Things I still want to order but the bill is getting pretty hefty so next time  1) More shima aji  2) UNI (sea urchin) - handroll if they have it  3) Anago sushi (the not barbecued sea eel, i feel like not a lot of places have them)  4) Tamago sushi (sweet egg sushi)  5) cold tofu (hiyayako)  6) Yaki nasu (grilled eggplant not it the sweet sauce)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - We came here last Friday looking forward to our fav dish, the salmon teriyaki dinner and we placed 3 orders for the 3 of us since my family don't like to share.  Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed as the salmon didn't taste as good as it was the last few times.  The dishes were still well presented and the service was still very good.    We'll probably still be back but not any time soon."}
{"text":"4.5  is my rating.  Finally got to try this place! Came here on a weeknight with my bro and tried their $65 omakase. Comes with 2 appetizers, 11 nigiri sushi, 6 pieces of negitoro rolls, a noodle soup, and dessert to finish.  I liked both their appetizers, and the appetizers served felt premium. One was 3 pieces of King Crab marinated in some special sauce of theirs - there must have been a pinch of alcohol in there because I could taste it. The other appetizer was Uni, salmon roe, and seaweed topped on a rice ball. This was tasty, but difficult to eat as the rice didn't stick together. There was a good selection of fish for the nigiri. Foie gras, Midai (Japan seabream), sweet shrimp, toro, etc all amazing choices. All top quality fish and really fresh. One thing I would comment though is their fish cut isn't perfect, but the rice and fish ratio is good. Most memorable to me was the Foie Gras sushi, what a nice big piece of foie gras!  I really enjoyed my meal. The deco of the place is really nice too. Decent price for a good amount of food. Best sushi spot in Richmond Hill I'd say."}
{"text":"Toshi Ryoriten is the newest Japanese restaurant in the area. I just love the decoration, tasteful, modern and with attention to details.  Lunch Menu serves till 3 pm.  Price wise is in line with the higher end Japanese restaurants. So don't expect anything under $10. A Chef Sushi Selection is $16 and Sashimi is over $20.  Chirashi Lunch with Salad and Soup ($16). The fish selection was A-OK though really thinly sliced. I did like the balance of Shari Rice. It was good but I was not really blown away.  For now a 3 star. Their omakase sushi is at $65 which is quit reasonable but if you are in Markham/Richmond Hill area, people would compare everything with Zen. Will it be the same or better?   For now it is a 3 star. But I am willing to come back again for some cooked food and even nigiri sushi to see the skill and knife work of the sushi chef."}
{"text":"Updated... Still good value for the price (they changed the menu back to $65), but recently had some off experiences like when they used piping hot rice to make the sushi."}
{"text":"My extremely long and short experience with your restaurant leaves me to describe you as a gilded turd.  The restaurant is beautiful and completely awed by it. Kudos to you for having an amazing vision for your restaurant, but was poor service and lack of respect to your customers part of that vision?  It took me at least 40 mins to get a table. I get it. It's busy and your sushi is all done by one chef.  But when your waitresses take at least another 15 mins to the table ready for the customer, you have a problem.  Your waitress proceeds to plop down menus, walk away and not serve tea or water.  Said waitress came back a lot later, sans drinks, and tell us that you no longer have rice. No apologies. Just get the sashimi.  I don't know about you but as an Asian restaurant having no rice is like committing the worse crime on the face of this planet.  Your chef might actually have to commit seppeku to redeem his honor for a failure this great, not that I endorse this.  Although I was starving coming to the restaurant, by now I was full of your garbage.  You couldn't have told me you were out of rice while I was waiting the 55+ mins?  All I wanted was the chirashi and you didn't even have ingredients to do that which is sashimi on RICE.  At this point, I'm glad I didn't get any tea so I could just get up and leave.  You didn't even have the decency to apologize.  Your service is piss poor. You have no consideration for your customer.  If you don't respect those who patronize you then why should I give you any in return.  I will warn everyone I know to avoid this sham you call a restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very nice and authentic Japanese restaurant. I can tell how the restaurant owner, and also the chef dedicated into this cozy restaurant. Great places to hang out, too. Nice and cozy"}
{"text":"Nothing special and pricey. Chef's choice Moriawase came with 10 sushi and 1 roll for $60.  It was just ok.  Give it 3 stars. Maybe this is better off as just a raw sushi bar and leave the cooked food out since the salmon teriyaki $28 was slightly over cooked and the sauce was gloopy and gelatinous. My friend's chicken teriyaki $25 was dry, over cooked dark meat. She couldn't eat it. Cooked food only gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"What an absolute joke. The Japanese are known for their perfectionism and this place was far from it.   My partner and I both ordered the $85 Toshi course. The first few dishes came out quite quickly. But after we got our foie gras nigiri, we had to wait 40 mins for the next dish (wtf)! Meanwhile, other people were still getting served. It eventually took the staff 20 mins to realize we were still waiting/starving. The dish we ended up waiting 40 mins for was some grilled shrimp and other grilled seafood.   At some points, the nigiri I was served by the sushi chef actually FELL over on the plate and he didn't even bother to fix it! Random grains of rice were also left on top of the sushi, and the sushi were all inconsistent in sizes. As someone who has dined at some of the best sushi restaurants in North America, this was absolutely unacceptable.   Lastly, we ended up getting food poisoning later that night. So thanks for robbing me $85 Toshi Ryoriten, I'll never visit you again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening with some friends. Good atmosphere and attentive service. The food quality is good and fresh. It's surprisingly hard to find a good Omakase restaurant in the uptown area so that's a big bonus. PriOrdered the $65 set course and some other sushi and sashimi on the side. All in all a good experience and would recommend it."}
{"text":"I think this is overrated  I will give 3,5 stars    It you want order sashmi   they are better than most Chinese and Korean Japanese Resturant around the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very basic Japanese food. Nothing fancy, but very over priced.  Few tables. Need do something new."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with some colleagues. The Gyoza were lite but full of flavor. I had the Chirashi bowl. It was nice but I would have liked a little more fish than what was provided. A few folks had the lunch specials and these also looked quite tasty. Overall this was good lunch experience."}
