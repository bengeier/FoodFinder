{"text":"This has become not only my favorite pizza place in Ajax/Pickering, but my favorite pizza place, period. This is one of the few pizza places left that puts love into every single pizza.

I ordered from here when I first moved to Ajax to feed the dozen friends and family that helped me move. We all agreed that this was the best pizza we had ever had. 

They also have a great  dine in restaurant and several beers on tap."}
{"text":"When this place opened, the first thing I noticed was that their prices were about 50% higher than the pizzeria (Gino's) that previously occupied the same space.

The pizzas are doughy with way too much cheese. I tried them a couple of times and then gave up. Meanwhile, the sandwiches have both too much sauce *and* too much cheese. And, finally, the food has been steadily declining in quality since they opened.

Tonight was my last time trying the food here. Tonight's food was both overpriced and undercooked.

If you're not picky about quality and you like paying too much, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We ate in & ordered make your own pizza with marinara sauce, anchovies, tomatoes & onions. Pizza was delicious. Great crust & lots of cheese. We also ordered wings with Diana's special sauce. It was just ok. I was told that the sauce was made with all the sauces on the menu which was Diana BBQ, honey garlic & hot sauce. I wouldn't order it again. 
We also ordered spaghetti with meatballs & mushrooms. It was a very big order. Definitely can't be for one person. Sauce was just ok & meatballs were probably from frozen.  It also came with garlic bread which was cooked perfect. 
Staff was friendly & service was fast. 
I would probably just get the pizza & try the panzarroti."}
{"text":"This will now be my go-to pizza place! We ordered 2 pizzas, wings, and poutine from Aunty's Recipe last night and I was VERY impressed. The food was hot and timely and the portions were huge. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are complaining about, if you want quality food its gonna cost a little more but its worth it. You can tell that everything is made fresh (even at 11pm). As a poutine lover I was thrilled at the portion size and the amount of cheese I received, the pizza was very cheesy too but who would complain about that! Normally you'd have to pay for extra cheese at other establishments.

Aunty's Recipe is definitely a hidden gem that is sure to become a family favourite."}
{"text":"This pizza was great. Stuffed with toppings!!! 
I will defiantly go back to this spot for the pizza . I also got wings but cant say I enjoyed them . They were overcooked and didn't have much meat."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza! All of the pizzas weigh like 5 pounds. The must use atleast a brick of cheese for each pizza. I've been eating here since it opened and have never left hungry. With that being said - if you like crunchy, thin crust pizza... this is not your place. 
Mushroom and pineapple is my favourite. Route 66, Mustang and jackpot  are all honorable mentions. 

Salads are great. Lasagna is great but order 45 mins ahead because she whips it up fresh ! 

A little pricey but as I said your paying for the 4 pounds of cheese on your pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place, probably my favourite pizza in Canada! I drive from downtown to Ajax just to get some of it!

The pizza may seem a bit expensive at first, but just know that it's not your ordinary pizza. In terms of heaviness, the pizza is very similar to a deep dish pizza. To put it into perspective, I can eat a Large pizza from domino's and pizza Pizza by myself. However, at Auntys Recipe, I can only eat half of a large pizza. I'd advise to split a large between 3 adults.

They are extremely generous with thr amount of cheese they put on the pizza. It's much more cheese than adding triple cheese to a domino's pizza. The pizza sauce is great, and make sure to request their special house hot sauce on the side. It's a great addition at no cost.

The place itself isn't fancy at all. However the service is fantastic. It's just a nice place to visit with my friends or with my family. 

I'd say it's the hidden gem of Ajax/ Durham Region."}
{"text":"Usually, I am not a huge fan of pizza. But aunty's recipe is totally different. The mozzarella cheese was thick and fresh and the tomato again is fresh and nicely done. The pizza was flavourful and ingredient freshly prepared.

Friendly service. Definitely a hidden gem and will return for more!"}
{"text":"Called in a pizza order for pick up thinking this was still Gino's (same phone number and address), but when got there discovered it's under new ownership. Pool tables are gone and new sign out front. The pizza was just okay - made with toppings under the cheese, but was fairly bland (not much spice to the toppings or the sauce). Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with TONS of toppings. A nice neighborhood restaurant with great food and good service."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is from the original owners of Gino's Pizza place. 

Came here with a couple of friends during lunch and there wasn't anyone in the restaurant. However the staff (doesn't seem like 'servers' would be the appropriate word) was very welcoming and friendly. 

Order two pizzas to share (definitely sharable!):
Mustang - ground beef, pepperoni, sausage, and a meat-atarian's dream. Not as salty as I expected it to be. Cheese is excessive and absolutely delicious! 

Hummus-Based Pizza (name forgotten at the moment and will be updated*) - my fave!!! Yes you can judge me for ordering a pizza from what seem slide the *healthy* part of the menu; but I knew what I was getting into. Olives, hummus and again loads and loads of cheese. 

I absolutely love the loads of cheese you get + the crispy crust. This is a place where you come to stuff your face -  can't really say it's gourmet as it says on its menu though. But goddamn it hits the spot well of your craving your greasy, cheesy, cheat day pizza."}
{"text":"We got 2 medium pizzas:
1) marinara with pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and sausage. 
2) pesto with chicken, spinach, and feta. 

Both were delicious - especially the pesto. Next time I think I'd prefer for them to go a little lighter on the cheese, although my boyfriend feels that they put a perfect amount, so it's just a matter of personal preference. I really enjoyed the crispy yet doughy crust which was cooked to perfection :) the sauces on both pizzas were also delicious and the ingredients tasted fresh. 

We had our pizza delivered right on time (within the 1 hour that they told us over the phone) and the employees were all friendly. Definitely would recommend this pizza joint."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Toppings are insane. XL feeds the multitudes. Prices well given the amount of food you're getting."}
{"text":"Met the owner and she was very personable. The pizza was loaded with toppings and cheese. Will definitely be back to try the panzo!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here after a long drive to Ajax. We wanted a sit down place that felt homey. After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for dinner. 

The restaurant looks really nice on the inside. The walls are adorned with posters and there are two televisions that were silently running in the background. There are eight tables (not counting the one by the front window) and are steel gray in color. The chairs are a similar shade and have rustic brown floral patterns on them. There are also two refrigerators that have beverages in them. One holds beer and the other holds non-alcoholic drinks. The beer refrigerator also has the Wi-Fi code on it (it's the phone number).

And now, on to our meals! We shared our meals as per usual and they were AMAZING. We ordered the Bolognese pasta, a poutine dish, and a small pizza that had marinara sauce with garlic, onions, and eggplant.

The Bolognese pasta had a chili kick to it and was absolutely delectable. We were in love with the wonderful and delicious taste and texture of the pasta. The poutine was also delicious, but it was slightly cool in temperature. Nevertheless, the dish was still cooked all the way through and it was incredibly tasty. I also feel that I should mention the size of the poutine dish. IT'S HUGE. The pizza was also tasty as well. It was very fluffy and it was doughy in texture. We all loved the taste that the pizza provided for us. 

Service was really good here. Our waitress was very nice. Needless to say, we will definitely be back the next time we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza - didnt realize it can get any better until now. absolute favorite!"}
