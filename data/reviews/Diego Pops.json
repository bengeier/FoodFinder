{"text":"I came here yesterday for my first time after wanting to try it out for months. The decor is too die for, so adorable! 

We got seated right away, I would of preferred the patio, but since it was Valentines Day I was happy we got seated at all without a wait. Our cute and bubbly comes in to greet us and we immediately ask to order the guacamole and she apologizes and says they are out and she should mention they're also out of flour tortillas?! Um, what? Mexican restaurant that doesn't have guac... you would think that would be simple to remake. But, of course maybe they didn't think they'd as busy this weekend being Valentines day and all. 

The great thing is they have happy hour all day on Sundays and the drinks were amazing and delicious and pretty and anything else you can think of. The food on the other hand was nothing spectacular. I will definitely be back to give them another try when they might be more prepared and not so busy. The place was too cute and I've heard too many great things to not try them out again."}
{"text":"I had a cod taco and a chicken taco. Both were very good! The service was excellent, and the patio is nice. The only complaint was that I have had better margaritas, larger, stronger etc for less $ at Blanco or elsewhere. But overall this is a great place. 

It's a very casual, laid back crowd, not the Scottsdale scene you might find other places in the area."}
{"text":"Came in to check out some tacos.  Hands down best place in Scottsdale for tacos and drinks alike.  Their all scratch kitchen and all scratch bar are by far the best I've had.  Bar tender Kimber took great care of us behind the bar.  Told us to come in and check out taco Monday's.  Hands down we'll be back Monday.  Come in and check out this place.  It's a must."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not only one of the cutest places in old town but it's some of the best tacos I've had in Arizona. We had previously been to The Mission and felt that it didn't really live up to the hype, Diego Pops blows it out of the water and 1/4 the cost. So many options and a creative menu. The ONLY reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because you have to pay for chips and salsa and that their guacamole sucks. 

Recommend all the tacos, but specifically the beef Machaca"}
{"text":"Normally the service is a little slow, but the food is good.  At our last outing, service was terrible.  Worse, when I talked with the owner, I didn't get the sense he cared.  What should have been a good experience for our out of town company turned into a bad one with no wanting to apologize by the restaurant.   I would avoid going here. If they don't care, things are going to continue to go downhill."}
{"text":"Contemporary & creative Mexican cuisine. Great service! Great atmosphere! Fair pricing. Make sure you try the Brussel sprout nachos!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner 6:45ish Friday night. Patio was full but we were seated right away inside. I have been in before before but my guest had not. He loved it more than I do lol we had street corn, Brussel sprout nachos, a green Chile chicken taco and a plantain taco. Server was great, food timing was perfect, food was delicious. I also had the guava coconut specialty cocktail that comes in a young coconut! Such a fun date night :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is both great an affordable. The good is delicious. They have a great Happy Hour.
Their vegetarian options are delightful. They use plaintains in place of meat. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place... the atmosphere, the outdoor seating, the interesting cocktails and good food, it's all so great! I try to come here whenever I'm near old town and craving some good Mexican food! I love their sauce tray as well, it has very unique blends of different spices and flavors! Their drink menu is super cute and I especially love their margaritas. Also their chips and salsa are yum. I would suggest getting the tacos without the slaw because the flavor is over the top and I like the simplicity of the taco when it doesn't have the slaw. I've never had issues with their service as they always get the food drinks out quickly."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best tacos and they never disappoint! Jasmine was our waitress and she was excellent! Can't  wait to come back here"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible mush for food - food tastes like they took it out from a can and sat on it for few hours and then served it.  Chips are small cracked and stale - like the ones remaining at the bottom of the large pack you buy and then the bottom remains for few months.  Salsa is water mush.  Dishes are horrible.  Avoid at all cost unless you are dying"}
{"text":"First Visit to Diego Pops! Definitely won't be our last! 

Be sure to ask to be seated at one of Steve Sparks' tables and order whatever he suggests that evening, he won't steer you wrong! Having grown up in the Valley and eating a lot of Mexican food, he said he felt like their tacos were some of the best in the Valley, and he wasn't wrong!

We tried the pineapple pork bowl with creamy beans and coconut rice. Brought half home and will definitely be looking forward to leftovers!  Also tried the green chile chicken taco in crispy corn tortilla, grilled steak in flour tortilla, grilled shrimp in crispy corn, and chicken adobo in crispy corn also! All were awesome-especially the grilled shrimp! I've tried grilled shrimp tacos from New England to San Diego and Portland to Miami, but have never had any with the flavors this had. 

They have a nice selection of domestic and import beer along with a variety of tequilas and cocktails. The mix a mean Michelada that is spicy but refreshing at the same time. 

Already looking forward to our next visit! Brussels sprouts nachos are first on the list!"}
{"text":"We're from out of town and rely on Yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint. Great outdoor patio and amazing food. All day happy hour on Sundays. We did a combination of tacos - the pineapple pork and braised green chili chicken are awesome."}
{"text":"Diego Pops is a cute little spot in a old Town Scottsdale. If you go, I highly recommend their pink sauce- whatever it is :) Brussels sprout nachos and prickly pear margaritas are some other good choices! Would be great if management provided placemats and/or menus that don't look like placemats as it is awkward and confusing when the waiter/waitresses removes them after we order. All in all great place though!"}
{"text":"Neat \"quaint\" looking place on outside....with a little bit of nice outdoor seating....way too dark and boomy music inside, where we ended up sitting, so hard to chat with our friends.  Their different \"bowls\" are both tasty and plentiful and they provide a real nice variety of fairly unusual sauces to put on it as you go.  Their standard salsa with the $2 chips n salsa order was outstanding.  As for their tacos....take a pass on the crispy pork one, for sure....too greasy. :-(  The bartender and his assistant in training  were both very friendly.  But, our server was more interested/focused at times early on in us answering her questions, vs. her answering ours......she got more helpful as time wore on. My \"shrimp\" bowl was good, but I felt sorry for our friend with the taco (it looked pitiful) that ended up ordering a dinner salad.  Not sure I'd go back.I give it three stars, because three of the four of us (that had bowls) were satisfied. I suspect it is a better evening \"bar scene\" place than a lunch spot for the more \"vintage ones\" like ourselves.   Seems to be many other nice choices in this nice area near \"old town\" though."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, good little place and food was good. If your in Scottsdale and Camelback area give them a try."}
{"text":"Great HH, cool ambiance. Great service and really good drinks. They also have a bunch of fun sauces they bring out with their chips for all customers. Even a simple bean and cheese burrito is great from here."}
{"text":"First time trying Diego Pops and I was not disappointed!!! Absolutely loved the Brussel Sprouts nachos!!! I will definitely return just for the nachos!!! I also really enjoyed the plantain taco! Such a great option for vegetarians!! I sat on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere and area, not too crowded."}
{"text":"I love the deco, the service was good. The shrimp taco I had was good but the nachos were delicious. Its a good trendy place."}
{"text":"The food is okay, nothing special. Our chips tasted old. Our server was really nice. This restaurant is nothing to out of your way to try. We had higher hopes for southern CA Mexican food."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar on outdoor patio with a beverage and Brussel sprout nachos seems like a dream.  Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic! We were there tonight for happy hour \"Sunday Funday\" tonight with visitors from out of state. The margaritas were Delish! The food presentation and branding were spot on. It doesn't stand out compared to its surrounding venues as a passerby so you might pass it, but I highly recommend you check it out and check out the Brussel Sprout Nachos!!!! Wait!!! What???? Brussel Sprouts? That's right! Do it. Go! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the setting of this restaurant. Cozy, fun outdoor patio, fun wrap-around bar. Start with the Brussels sprouts nachos and a Diego Margarita then order the crispy green chili chicken tacos! Give their Taco Monday a try or go hang out on the patio for Sunday Funday and have a coconut drink. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place rules! Best tacos in town and not too pricy! Always clean and has an awesome patio.   Staff is friendly, very welcoming.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place, the plantain taco was delicious. I was there on lunch and the service was poor but maybe on dinner it would be better. 
Super cute place."}
{"text":"Their bowls are good portion but are lacking something. Food Is solid and service is good. The dessert menu is phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"Diego pops is honestly the bomb. I've been coming here ever since I moved to Scottsdale and I have never been disappointed. Danny and Fox were the greatest bartenders and treated my friend and I with the most exceptional service. Go to Diego Pops if you want great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! They service is wonderful, the food is beyond amazing and the drinks are superb! I just can't get enough. Not to mention, they have an incredible happy hour!! So happy i found this gem. I frequent often! Bring on the happy hour!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I had a great time at Diego Pops. Food was fresh and flavorful. The service was top-notch. We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Feeling sad, mad, happy, lonely, excited? Is it your birthday, anniversary, or just a Wednesday THIS IS YOUR SPOT! Best staff and food! Their happy hour kills the game and the margaritas are amazing! Order the brussel sprout nachos, they will blow your mind! #gottahavemypops"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! Lorraine makes the best margaritas!! Brussel sprout nachos for the win! We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! I ran into this place while they were at the Arizona Taco Festival and I was able to try their braised pineapple beef tacos and was blown away. It might have taken me a year to finally try the restaurant and was not disappointed. The service, by Leslie, was superb. She was attentive, informative, and made the experience worthwhile. THANK YOU, LESLIE! I tried three of their tacos and the churro fries with three dipping sauces which was a delightful surprise and end to the visit. I recommend the braised pineapple beef tacos, it is award winning, and the crispy cod. Great visit!"}
{"text":"I like this spot for a variety of reasons, including the great service I always receive and the delicious food. It's actually a menu that enables you to create healthy options without giving up too much. They play good tunes and have a nice patio bar. Good for a date or with friends."}
{"text":"It was during an on-site photoshoot production for The Style Line that I discovered the striking mid-century character of the foyer and the enlivening accents of the menu at Diego Pops. The ambiance of this restaurant made for an excellent scene for pop photography. Bold neon makes an appearance around every corner; neon lettering reads \"Cómo México no hay dos\" (there is no place like Mexico) and baby blue-colored booths are book-ended by neon-printed pineapple wallpaper. 

I ordered the \"Sweet Corn + Avocado Caesar\" Salad complete with grilled salmon. This salad was served in perfect portion and proportion, making an flavorful balance of sweet and savory. I love the array of salsa that is provided with crispy tortilla chips - do not hesitate to sample each salsa and add more to your salad if you wish. 

Very friendly and accommodating staff and management. I felt very welcome and comfortable in their establishment. 

Be careful when parking - small lot just in front of restaurant may fill very quickly. 

Please refer to my photos for more on my experience."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food, because we couldn't eat here because we had our dog with us. They don't allow dogs on their patio, which was the first time I've encountered this in Scottsdale. Service dogs only. We'll go back, but without our pup! Not sure the reasoning behind no dogs on the patio."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in Old Town! The retro feel in this Mexican restaurant was super unique. Patio seating with a fireplace is always an added bonus in AZ. The margaritas were exceptional. We had the traditional poke appetizer, good for a couple people. For dinner we tried the braised pineapple pork bowl and the shrimp tacos. Outstanding! They have a nice selection of homemade salsa/dressings to try with your meals, too. Really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"To begin with Diego Pops is my favorite restaurant to go eat at and hangout in Scottsdale, Arizona. They have an amazing patio outside to sit and enjoy your food and cocktails and if your not in the mood they have a very nice modern restaurant inside to sit at with a bar that serves many beers on draft and some signature made margaritas. But they have amazing décor there and some good vibes, you walk in they have music playing and its overall nice and relaxing. It's a nice place to show up for happy hour with your friends and hang out with friends or even have a family get together. Diego Pops is an amazing place to start, end or have a nice dinner out in Scottsdale. 

Now the reason why Diego Pops is one of my favorites restaurant because of the food they have the best tacos in town hands down! Too start out they have phenomenal appetizers. When I went there I got the Brussels Sprout nachos, which were to die for. It came out with a sunny side egg on top which I've ever had before on nachos, also it came with chicken on it, cheese and some homemade sauces they have. And it's a perfect size to share with 3-4 people. Then after the appetizer it only gets better because they have the best tacos there! They have a wide selection of tacos like, steak, green chili chicken, cod, shrimp and more. But when I went I got the Beef machaca taco with a crispy taco and it was so delicious it watered in my mouth. Then I got another taco, which was the cod taco on a soft corn tortilla, and normally I don't eat fish but the way it was prepared with lettuce onions and there special sauce it was so good. Now if you're not in the mood for tacos, they also have burritos, salads and some poke bowls! After our specular meal we ordered a dessert, which was the churro sundae! It came out with vanilla on top with dulce and de leche with churros under it. To me I loved it because I'm sweet person but on the other hand my girlfriend wasn't the biggest fan. 

After our visit our bill wasn't bad at all, we ordered a lot of food and drinks and it wasn't that much. But it also isn't cheap; it would be more in the middle for cost. But its all quality food for sure. Also they have a happy hour 3-6 pm Monday-Friday which has super good deals so take advantage of that. You can get there house margaritas for half off which is like 4 dollars. And when its not happy hour the tacos are a good price, for 2 BBQ chicken tacos its 10 dollars, for 2 chicken tacos its 9 dollars and for the steak its 11 bucks so all the tacos are priced fairly the same. Then there bar has drinks going from 8-15 bucks just depends on there signature margs you order or even a Mexican mule. There beer is also priced nice, 5 bucks for a pint and they have many to choose from. Overall I would say Diego Pops is very affordable for some good food. 

What even made my experience at Diego Pops better was the service. When we first got there it only took us a couple minutes to get seated even when they were a little busy. Then we had our waiter approach us and help us go over the menu and told us all about the deals going on. The wait for food wasn't bad at all, it was in and out very quick and prepared nicely. The reason why I come back as well is because the service is always on point, fast and friendly! 

Overall I would give this place a 4 out of 5 stars! I would recommend to anyone out there, Its to delicious and everyone should go try. But order wisely when you go and you shall have the time of your life at Diego Pops and definitely leave with a full stomach."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place; however, after my recent experience, I'm not so sure about that. I was really disappointed to find out that they changed the recipe of the taco that I liked to order, and now it just doesn't taste quite right. I come here quite a bit, but with the menu change and average service, I'm just not sure if I want to make the 25 minute drive back. Please bring back the original adobo BBQ chicken taco!!"}
{"text":"Great neat place!! I had one of the best breakfast burritos in town!! I don't remember what my wife had I was busy eating my burrito!!! Thanks Cory!!"}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts nachos all day. And twice on Sunday. Sit at the bar and have Ashlyn make you a margarita. Drink the margarita, eat the nachos, and thank me whenever you're finished."}
{"text":"Love this place, but whoever manages their check-in offer on yelp needs to turn it off when they will no honor it...  Apparently on Monday, Sunday, and during happy hour."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I randomly came on taco Monday. Received amazing service from Lorraine and Ashley and the tacos were great. The skirt steak tacos and braised pineapple pork were particularly tasty, but I ended up ordering 10 tacos because the quality and price were impossible to beat. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tiny parking lot, but parking nearby. Great patio and plenty of seating. We sat at the outdoor bar. Really enjoyed the watermelon margarita. The coconut one was good as well. Liked the salsa which came with the chips, but I wouldn't order the guacamole again. I had the chicken green chili tacos and they were tasty. Definitely going back to enjoy that patio."}
{"text":"El restaurante es bueno, la comida está bien, pero el servicio es muy malo. Nuestro camarero estaba más preocupado por su aspecto y flirteo que por brindar un buen servicio."}
{"text":"i love to eat and drink here. really good food, great prices, with super adorable, friendly waitstaff and bartenders who whip up delicious concoctions.   try the charred steak or salmon bowl with brown rice and stewed beans - half of it will fill you up. large portions, wonderful garden patio, and monday night's tacos are a steal. visited a couple dozen times, it's my favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Been there twice and it keeps getting better! Brussel sprout nachos are unique and incredible!"}
{"text":"Decent tacos.  Not authentic mexican food, but worth a stop in for Happy Hour or \"Taco Monday\"....damn that's original!  I'm just waiting for somebody to have \"Taco Wednesday\" so I can pig out 3 nights in a row for $10/night.  Make it happen.  Work it out."}
{"text":"Kelsie and Lorraine are the best and treated us like we are family. I love coming here and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, drinks, and service. Kimber and Ashlyn were my bartender/servers and overall was a great first impression!"}
{"text":"Wow! Diego Pops in Scottsdale was great!! My fiancé and I split the quesadilla and I got the green chili chicken bowl, she got a salad (she's not a big eater) The thing that set Diego Pops apart from the other restaurants we've been to in Scottsdale was the service. We had a younger boy named Alex or Allen, I'm sorry, just blanking on the name. He is maybe 16 or 17, very skinny (should probably eat some more of the burritos LOL!) He was fantastic, and definitely made our experience special, will definitely be coming back next year! 

Thank you Allen and the rest of the Diego Pops staff!

-Brandon"}
{"text":"Steve was awesome! Super personable and attentive to our table. The service and the food were both on point, and I'd definitely recommend the guacamole to anyone (watch out if you're in a group, or it'll be gone before you know it)!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. The bowls are huge! Could probably feed two people! Unfortunately the service was terrible hence just 3 stars. The server was friendly but completely inattentive. This my first experience and its a shame it was ruined by the service."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and feel good people. The food is also quality and unique. Definitely a must try place in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Delish margaritas. Very hospitable staff. Cute decor. Definite must visit in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The decor is super cute, and I can spend all day & night on the patio. Their fried plantains are to die for, as well as their prickly pear margarita. The crispy cod is my favorite taco- but you can't go wrong with any of them. Great location & vibe"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and I am not impressed. The atmosphere looks cute and promising, but the food is disappointing. The servers are honestly so snobby.  The only good thing about Diego Pops is their Brussels sprout nachos."}
{"text":"We tried out this restaurant last Sunday and had a good experience.  The shrimp tacos were the stand out on the menu.  The green Chile chicken needed a little more flavor, as did the pineapple pork.  

We thought our server Paris was great!  She treated us well and checked on us often.

We'll be back to try out the rest of the tacos soon!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  We had a large party and they were able to accommodate with skimping on service. Fabulous sangria!"}
{"text":"First stop we made when arriving to AZ and will be back this week. Great food and drinks but most importantly...AMAZING service! Thanks, Ashlyn!"}
{"text":"My friend convinced me to try this place because of a previous experience he had and we both loved it! The best street corn and tacos in town! Our waiter Anthony was just absolutely wonderful thanks for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"this is the best place to get tacos! The atmosphere is great and the service is even better! my waitress kaylie was awesome and she had a great attitude! Me and my daughter come in all the time and now we won't sit anywhere besides kaylies section :)"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio. Margaritas, chips and Guacamole, $2 tacos on Monday. It was all good."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat, and I've eaten here several times before and the food was okay, step up from fast food, and good for the intoxicated.  Tonight was absolutely the worst experience.   Sat down at the outside bar and after 10 min the bartender 'Trevor' never said hi, or asked me what I wanted.  He had chatted with a couple other people that were at the bar.  The other people left and I was the only one at the bar.  Then 2 pretty girls sat down and he immediately Trevor asked them what they wanted, food or drink.  I asked if he was going to even ask me and he acted surprised, as if I just appeared.   
I asked for a menu and ordered 3 tacos and I asked for ice water, he managed to find the dirtiest glass possible with all kinds of stuff on it.  Let's just say this bartender was the worst."}
{"text":"Amazing Taco Tuesday!!  Our waitress handled a group of 30 gaggling girls seamlessly. Food was delicious. Nachos, green chili chicken tacos and pineapple pork tacos were everyone's favorite. No incorrect orders or confusions, we were in and out."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a couple of times.  First couple of times the food and service were great and i couldn't say enough about the place.  The last time (this past spring) we sat outside at the bar and the staff seemed more interested in socializing with each other than taking care of customers.  I had taken someone new there and was a little embarrassed that I recommended it for dinner that night."}
{"text":"Best nachos we've ever had! Amazing service, food, drinks, atmosphere, and cant beat prices! Steve was the best! If youre looking for a place to eat & get a good drink in Scottsdale, this is a must."}
{"text":"Best Margaritas and tacos In town! Lorraine and Ashlyn are amazing!!!!! National Margarita Day / Monday Taco Specials = Amazing!"}
{"text":"After a happy hour and a taco monday, im on board with this place. the combo of those 2 would be ideal.

3-6p M-F HAPPY HOUR nets you half off apps/botanas.
$4 margaritas and $3 beer. 

APPS. the chicken tortilla soup is the best deal and quite hearty as its served in a big ass bowl, normally only $4. the brussel sprout nachos are next best, as far as a good deal at hh goes, and interesting with the street corn queso as a topping along with a fried egg.

the chips and salsa are questionable.
you can pass on the wings..

TACOS. i liked them. i tried 4. normal size and $2-3 all day mondays. they have several different sauces to add to the eats, some good, some okay. smart doing taco days other than a tuesday. but really, shouldnt every day be taco day?

also theres a little ice cream bar but have yet to delve into that part of the biz.

good first impressions but this could easily lose a star with one slip up.

#sayyestotacos"}
{"text":"I can understand the attraction to this place. Loud music, bright colors, well decorated but the food is awful. I've been here three times and every time the food is just miserable. You have to order chips and salsa which is a pet peeve I have about these modern Mexican restaurants. The chips are soggy. The quac is turning brown and has mango in it, I don't know why you have to put fruit in quac? The tacos barely have meat in them especially their chicken tacos. The house margarita was sour and the waitress forgot salt on the rim. Something is wrong with their draft system. The beer taste bitter and stale. I must be missing something. People seem to love coming here. Maybe they are better during lunch hours but overall I have not been very impressed each time I've come here."}
{"text":"I tried Diego Pops for the first time last week and it was amazing! The staff and service were both on point. Combine that with great food and a fantastic tequila selection, and Diego Pops has become my new favorite! PS - Get the Brussels sprout nachos, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place Saturday night after reading the rave reviews on Yelp. However, we were greatly disappointed.  The ambiance was great (the only reason I'm giving it a star); we were seated outdoors. However, the food was not good and the service stunk.  We ordered the guac and salsa which was pretty good. But I ordered two tacos with rice and beans, my husband ordered a bean and cheese burrito and requested grilled chicken be added to it.  After about 20 minutes of waiting for our food, it finally arrived and was cold and tasteless. I thought it was just my food, but my husband noted the same thing about his (cold and the beans tasted bland), along with the fact that no chicken was added to his burrito. So, he essentially had cold bland beans wrapped up in a tortilla.  Our waiter still charged us for the addt'l chicken so I took it out of his tip.  I would have told him about the incorrect charge but it took him FOREVER just to bring the food and bill. I didn't want to take addt'l time to wait for him to come around to adjust the bill.  I don't know what all the rage is about this place.  Definitely won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"[Never finished this review from Feb, so here goes] Oh dear... This place needs help.  A group of 14 hungry girls came here for dinner last Feb.  We were so excited for all things Mexican and this is (honestly) a very cute restaurant in a great location.  We sat down and immediately tried to order pitchers of margaritas and guacamole (duh!).  The waiter decided that this might be a good time to inform us that they were out of guacamole.  Strike one.  He also informed us that they were out of flour tortillas - how is that even possible?? Strike two.  After blank stares and conversation among our group we decided that we could salvage our Mexican night with queso and brussel sprout nachos.  5 minutes later the waiter came back (noticeably without our margaritas) and we asked for several orders of the above mentioned cheesy deliciousness.  He then told us that they ran out of cheese, so both the nachos and queso were not in our future.  This may be a good time to mention that the menu here is pretty limited (tacos, ceviche, avocado-y greatness and cheesy items), so this was very upsetting news.  Our waiter didn't seemed too fazed with the fact that they had run out of 90% of the menu, which maybe means it happens often (unclear)? After some back and forth with our waiter friend, we landed at the following: four pitchers of margaritas (but... surprise, they were out of some of them) and vouchers for free tacos to use at a later date and time (unfortunately, 13 of the 14 were visiting from out of town and had no plans to return...).  All in all, our dining experience here was not filling (literally), but the restaurant has a cool vibe, so perhaps they have been able to figure out that they need to actually have food to serve."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food here never disappoints. The Brussel sprout nachos are amazing! Jessica and Nick are my favorite bartenders here ! They both are so friendly and make really yummy drinks :) I highly recommend Diego Pops, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Passed by a few times before I decided to stop in and was really impressed. The bowl options are excellent! The staff are friendly and I had great service. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cute idea with different food that I was excited to try. Unfortunately, the pretty good food that I would normally give 4 stars for was demolished by service and heat. It was an Arizona summer day and the inside of the restaurant was a very uncomfortable 85 degrees. One of the people from our party asked the waiter if there was a fan or anything to make it more comfortable and he just shrugged us off and continued with his slow service.  All-in-all, it took an hour to get our food and we downed it just to get back to our air-conditioned car. I wanted to like this place. Bummer."}
{"text":"This was the most horrific Mexican food I have ever had. From the wings we ordered to the tacos and even my friends burrito it was all garbage. Even the guacamole had no flavor, how is that even possible. Their speciality margaritas tasted like they used generic sour mix, the whole food experience was awful! Cool setting though.

P.S. For a supposed chic Mexican place, they didn't even know what a blood orange margarita was. Pathetic..."}
{"text":"Fantastic patio!  Brussel sprout nachos are superb even if you don't like Brussel sprouts.  We get the best service every time we go."}
{"text":"First time here and food was awesome! Alec provided great service, he was funny, nice, and on top of things! Try the Brussel sprout nachos they will blow you away."}
{"text":"Meh. Cool atmosphere, great location Bad service, ok food. I LOVE Mexican food but this isn't the place. If you want good food, margs, and service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Diego pops has a great atmosphere and delicious tacos that are very well priced! The service was great and our server Jessica was helpful and nice. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a fun & summery meal!"}
{"text":"Can I say fantastic? Cus it is. Visiting from out of town. From the open air vibe to the awesomeness of our server (Chantill) this place is a 5 star solid. Have a couple of days left in town and will definitely return. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great bar tender! We had the fresh one margarita and tacos- all delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The taco bowls and speciality margaritas were awesome! The service was on point and the food cane out super quick. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"All of my experiences here have never been great. Service is always par at best, seems to be only if you get lucky with a good server. I love their food but their service is just meh...always. I come (came) here about 2 times a month for countless months. My drive to this restaurant is roughly a 25 minute one way trip for some tasty tacos. Found out today they no longer have the adobo bbq taco. Not too sure I will be returning (at least not nearly as often or go out of my way to go here any longer). If the service was better I would return or if the bbq taco was back I'd return but with both lacking not sure it is worth it anymore...sad to say I loved that taco."}
{"text":"Went here for a girls happy hour. The place itself is cute. Nice décor. The food was just ok. Nothing special that I would go back for. The best thing I had was probably the white sangria there. I had the street corn queso which was good. The coconut lemongrass ceviche isn't something I would get again. The brussels sprout nachos were ok."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at Diego Pops. I came here on a Monday so wasn't a busy at all. The food was good. Overall the service really was horrible. I can't remember her name but she wasn't friendly at all to me and my friends. We felt like she didn't want to take care of us. When she brought those sauces she didn't explain them at all. I had to ask her. She didn't ask is this your first time here either. My friend ordered something and she didn't even know what it was she was eating. The waitress looked at her and said how do you not know what that is?? It was just rude!! So check your service staff because they are not very helpful with the menu and kind of snobby!"}
{"text":"I was just wandering by and so glad I stopped in. We only ordered the brussel sprout nachos because they were mentioned often in reviews and looked so interesting. But they don't just look interesting, they taste fantastic. Everything is homemade and delicious. Wow. Come and order this dish!"}
{"text":"Went in and had a shrimp taco, Mexican corn and chips and guacamole.  Very good tasting food, however two big  problems: First, the tortilla with my shrimp taco was not fresh made; no way!  I had everyone at my table look at the tortilla and taste it and the consensus was all the 
same, \"Not a fresh made tortilla!\" The tortilla had a factory taste and look.  Seriously, the manager had the nerve to look me in the face and tell me that \"all\" tortillas were made fresh daily.  I've eaten and cooked enough with store bought packaged tortillas and fresh made market tortillas to know the difference.  Prior to speaking with the manager, I asked our server if the tortillas were made fresh and her response was,\"I believe so.\" Seriously,  all your primary dishes are served with tortillas, and the menu says that all tortillas are made fresh and your response is, \"I believe so?\"  That leads me to believe that they are not.  When I advised the manager in regard to her server's response, I received the following response, \" I have three new employees in training and I don't expect them to know everything.\"  Seriously, in case you didn't know that your primary food is tacos and burritos and you don't expect a server to know 100% that the tortillas  are made fresh??? Sounds like the manager wasn't even sure!  Overall,  I would recommend this place, but pretty bothered by the lack of knowledge and the manager's poor excuse.  Look, if you ran out of fresh made tortillas because I came in at 7:00 PM then so be it, just be honest and don't make up excuses for your employees."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the ASU game and sat at the bar. Jessica was our bartender and was awesome. Great chips and guacamole and drinks!"}
{"text":"We are in town for a couple days to soak up some sunshine. Unfortunately, Diego Pops didn't really do it for us. Extremely poor service and the food isn't that great either--lets start from the beginning. Picture a slow Monday and a restaurant half empty, and the 2 of us, excited about the prospect of some great tacos. We're from Chicago so we think we r in for a real treat...We approach the hostess who says there aren't anymore seats outside. Ok, we think. We are pale, starving out-of-towners so maybe it's for the best. She brings us to our table indoors--the smallest 2 top (for 2 6ft people) in the far dark corner. As we scan the restaurant, we see booths with couples and many empty booths and table options. Whatever, we think, we won't be here for long and continue to be optimistic. 3 min later we watch as the that couple behind us in line gets sat outside...it would have been nice to get a timeframe but again, we brush it off. It takes no time at all to get drinks (water) and some chips & salsa but then the real wait begins. 30 min later our waiter never comes back to get the rest of our order. When he does, it's another 45 min for 6 tacos. When the tacos finally came, they were cold and flavorless. Pineapple relish on a pork taco? Sounds great but it's 3 pieces of fresh pineapple. Slaw? Try shredded iceberg. Thank god for the sauces but my husband had to go get them himself sThey did comp our $20 bill, so thank you for that. But honestly, if you want really delicious tacos this isn't your place. If you want some chips, salsa, & margs in a super cute spot then by all means, go. They should invest as much effort into their tacos as they do their decor."}
{"text":"Came in tonight and sat at the bar and Ashlyn was my bartender she was super attentive and amazing (give this girl a raise!!) I've been a regular here since they've opened and love Ashlyn and Lorraine...best bartenders in town :)) definitely love this place"}
{"text":"First off the drinks we're one of the best I've ever had! Brussel sprit nachos were AMAZING! Poke and pineapple pork bowl were delicious as well! Waitress was very helpful with the menu!  Cool and trendy atmosphere! If you are in the area you must go!!!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting and am glad I stopped by. We had their Brussels sprout Nachos which are so great!  They have a handful of sauces to choose from for your tacos. We tried their shrimp and cod tacos both very flavorful. Their coconut rice was delish. The churro and soft serve ice cream were on point and their service was great.  I want to return maybe for their happy hour so I can get a taste of all their different tacos and have a coconut drink or ceviche, idk but am certain I will return very soon!"}
{"text":"Killer atmosphere, great staff and even better guacamole. Will definitely be a go to any time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love the food here it's so tasty! However, there used to be a server here who would braid his hair and he always had the best attitude! Was so helpful and generous and I haven't seen him a while! Bring him back, he was the best!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Chill vibe, bright colors, and great food. Go for the all day happy hour on Sunday! Received great service our first time, second time we had to ask the waiter for chips 4 times and waited a ridiculously long time for our food and it wasn't busy, but maybe he was just having an off day. Still loved the tacos and the diego margarita is great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem on accident, what a pleasant surprise! Very unique fun aesthetic with a mod 50s vibe. Great service, delicious food, and amazing cocktails. I ordered the crispy cod bowl and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, cold beer, amazing service. I recommended the green chili chicken taco, and the chicken tortilla soup. Kimber and Ashlyn are my favorite bartenders, they always take care of me."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, stylish interior, great service and make sure you try the churro Sunday!"}
{"text":"The variety of taco options  is exceptional! The cod fish taco was amazing. Go to this place!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mexican Food Spots! Loved having Diego Pops as our lunch sponsor for our Phoenix Workshop! Thank you for the delicious taco fix!"}
{"text":"Mexican & Southwestern favorites with the coolest twist. Well worth it for ambience, location, food & service."}
{"text":"Not sure why I'm having such a hard time trying to book a reservation at this restaurant. Not sure who owns this restaurant but I'm sure they would not be happy knowing their manager Cory is denying a reservation for a large group of people, even willing to put a credit card on file. I guess we will have to wait and see if he accepts this business or lose money."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here once, but two of us ordered several tacos and found them to be pretty good to excellent.  Service was good and the restaurant was really clean.  Will definitely go back to try some more food."}
{"text":"My husband and I held our wedding reception at Diego Pops back in October and it was wonderful. We worked with Rebecca to come up with a budget, menu, and layout for the night.   We were able to rent out the entire restaurant for the evening and had so much fun dancing to our own playlist. Rebecca, Cory, and all of the staff at Diego Pops were incredible and worked really hard to ensure every single person in attendance had a great night. We still have friends and family that reminisce about how much fun they had that night - and how good the food and drinks were! Date night, girls night out, office lunch party, wedding reception, or whatever the occasion might be, Diego Pops is the perfect place! I couldn't possibly say enough good things about them."}
{"text":"Had the pork taco. Go with the suggestion of the crispy shell. It was made fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Casual dining, reasonable prices, friendly service, and great food!  If you don't fill up on the homemade salsa, guacamole and tortilla chips, try the Crusted Cod in a bowl with creamy beans and coconut rice!  As we say in Hawaii \"broke da mouth!\"  My friends also enjoyed the green chile chicken burrito and skirt steak tacos. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I give it two stars because the ice cream and drinks were really good but the customer service wasn't so good. I had barely ordered my first drink and they had already brought out my bill. The place was nearly empty and it was late so I don't understand why they were so in a rush to get rid of us."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a couple of friends earlier this week and we had such an amazing waiter, Anthony! Very welcoming, attentive and amusing so service is 10/10. Should totally have the brussel sprouts nachos or their beef machaca tacos, too; they're so delicious! I will definitely be back soon (:"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, and the food wasn't great. The Brussels sprouts nachos that everyone mentions were clearly made hours before , they were cold and soggy and not that good. Granted it was a Saturday night but three hours for some tacos and soggy apps was not worth it."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I came here based on the good ratings and it was just average at best. I ordered the Diego margarita, Brussels sprout nachos and the chicken and pork tacos. For a Mexican restaurant, I expected the margaritas to be better. It was only $4 though so the speciality ones are probably better. The Brussels sprout nachos were good. The tacos were very boring. The green chile chicken taco did not taste like green chile at all and was very plain. The server never brought us the sauces for the tacos so that is probably why they were so dry/boring. I did not realize until after the meal that every other table had the basket of sauces. 

The service was fast and we did not wait long for our food, which was great. The prices were also very good."}
{"text":"Pitchers of beer said $17 and served 4-5. Got charged $20 for a \"premium pitcher\" of beer that poured 3.25 beers and the pint alone was $5. Misleading and incorrect. Good food but service was slow on a relatively slow night."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and Steve makes the BEST margaritas! Great service!!! Definitely try the skirt steak and shrimp tacos. So many sauces to choose from !  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I never like to give a low star review, but my experience at Diego Pops was pretty worthy of it. I came late, around 9:30 on a weekend night, and sat down with a friend who was already there. I didn't even see our waitress for fifteen minutes, but luckily the manager came by to drop off my friends drink and took my order. I also had to order my food with the drink runner because the waitress was MIA. But that's not what annoyed me, what really got me was that after we got our food, our waitress came literally every 5 to 10 minutes asking \"you ladies doing alright?\". Yes, yes we are. Just like we were 5 minutes ago. She came about ten times in a 45 minute period, and it made me mad honestly. I am having a conversation with my friend and am constantly being interrupted by this girl. It was rude and it made us feel rushed, even though the restaurant wasn't full and plenty of people had come in after us to eat so it's not like we were the last ones. I will say the only reason that I didn't give this place one stars was because I thought the manager (female, brunette) was being attentive and involved just the right amount with all the tables. The food was mediocre, the Brussel sprout nachos were good but the guac had way, way too much lime in it, it was inedible. Good luck diego pops, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food and cool atmosphere but consistently bad service. All 3 occasions I've tried to overlook the service but tonight I can't accept this. Water refills are a chore. Absent minded servers (all 3 times). Over 45 minutes for our server to take the order. I had to get her at the server station. No exaggeration. Appetizers came in an orderly fashion but we never saw a manager on the floor or touching tables. Basically a cool concept with zero clue about service standards or delivering a guest experience. I figure this starts with lackadaisical leadership at an owner level because the lack of management is apparent here and in their other concepts. That's a shame."}
{"text":"Walking around looking for a place to eat lunch Sunday and stumbled to this spot and I'm glad I did. Started off with the guacamole and house salsa. The guac was standard and the salsa had some kick to it. 

Ordered three tacos and I will start with my favorite and end with my least favorite. The braised pineapple pork is tremendous. So much flavor in it and it all balances out well. The second one I tried was the charred skirt steak. The steak was great but everything else was bland. The third one was the grilled shrimp. It wasn't very good I wouldn't recommend ordering it.

Even though I only really liked 1 of the 3 tacos I ordered I really enjoyed my experience here. The atmosphere was great and the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely won't be back. The bartender did not greet us, she just slapped menus in front of us and walked away. We were the only people at the bar at this point. We ordered our food and drinks and they arrived in a timely manor, but the food was not good. My husband ordered the green chili chicken plate and it was terrible. I had tacos, they weren't that great either.  It almost tasted like nobody gave a shit, if that makes sense. While we sat there a few other people came in to order food and we noticed that they never got silverware-one man had to get up himself to get it. We also heard the bartender complaining about working a double and also complaining about another coworker...I get it, but that is completely unprofessional especially when customers can hear and it does not excuse rude service. So not only was the food bad, but the whole experience in general left a bad taste in our mouths. I also have to add that I cannot believe a shot of casamigos is $15 (I had this with pineapple juice as a drink)...seriously...maybe if this was a nicer place, but come on. Just plain bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim to try it out with my fiancée and we were not impressed at all. Ordered the street corn queso and it was super lacking on flavor and also pulled a large chunk of butter from it. Tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn't there. My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold. We Couldn't even finish the meal. The salsa was the only highlight of the lunch. Also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Diego Pops is the cutest place ever. Food was amazing. Drinks were good EXCEPT for the Michelada. It was too tart. 

I ordered the Brussels Sprouts Nachos which were fantastic! Brussels sprouts made to perfection. The egg was a lovely addition as well. I then had the California burrito which was very tasty. The sweet corn came through to my surprise and liking. The French fries in the burrito were fun as well. Probably not necessary but fun. 

For drinks I got the Guava Coconut. It wasn't out of this world but tasty for sure. Though it was overpriced. 

Going back to the Michelada. It's a spicy tomato juice and dos Equis drink (with other ingredients). It was BAD. They should really remove this item off the menu. The drink was sour and tasted of liquid vomit."}
{"text":"Great food! Yummy tacos! And I almost stole the tub of green sauce it's so frickin good on the tacos!
One of my new favorites for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas in an outdoor garden terrace.  The tacos were delicious as well.  The service was on point. Definitely recommend for drinks and tacos.  Went here twice when I was in Scottsdale.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the food didn't blow me away.  Also they should have all their margaritas on at a discounted price for happy hour not just the basic one.  Even if it was only $2 or $3 off I would have stayed and drank more.  Heck, I would have tried them all."}
{"text":"We had some pretty high hopes for Diego Pops considering all of the positive reviews!

It failed in every area except location and decor.

Food:
With all of the amazing Mexican food in the Phoenix area (and we tried a ton), this was without a doubt the worst and most un-authentic tasting we have had, and we're from Canada!
If I was a mexican chef or patron, I would be seriously offended by eating this.   The most bland, pedestrian, flavourless mexican food in Phoenix, hands down.  The guacamole came out cold and without flavour.  Have you ever shopped at costco? this was their guac.  I can only imagine the \"chef\" scooping this out of large container in the fridge.  The cheese quesadilla was luke warm cardboard, and we couldn't eat it.  The queso corn dip was so bland and soupy, it was pretty much a corn chowder.  how hard is it to grill corn and then cut it off into some queso?  Apparently impossible at Diego Pops, but not every other restaurant we ate at and tried this dish.  The tacos were really boring, and the jalapeños weren't even cut through and spread out in the tacos, lazy lazy chef skills there, just a chunk of pepper.  Seriously though, are the chefs shopping for ingredients at costco?  a few hours from mexico, in a high end area, and this place gets all these good reviews and is still able to pay the rent?  wow.

The drinks: 
if you still decide to go here and waste your money, order beer.  the sangria was without a doubt the worst we have had anywhere in the world (and that includes the cheapest Spanish bar you could walk into).  We didn't drink them and sent them back.  Had the bartender ever tasted Sangria?  Hold on, what bartender! It was actually our inattentive server (more on that later) doing the mixing.  Seriously, I would be embarrassed to charge anything for this Sangria.  Have the owners ever eaten at a Mexican restaurant before?  I ordered a beer, and it was the only redeeming part of the meal.

The service:
Worst in Phoenix, hands down.  Inattentive young girls with too much makeup who are clearly much too interstesed in gossiping with each other than doing their jobs.  Our server forgot quite a few items we ordered (which worked out better in the end).  Took away almost full plates of food and almost full drinks and didn't ask if we liked them or not.  They were devoid of personality, and looked equally at home serving drinks at a bar by the airport.  If you've ever been to the Cactus club in Canada, this was the arizona equivalent.  

I would recommend the owners actually eating elsewhere in the Phoenix to get some perspective on just how bad everything is.  Barrio Cafe or Tranquilo would be a good start.  Fresh, local, innovative, and authentic.  its really not that hard.

If you're visiting or a local, skip this place.  The reviews are deceiving."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos and a chill environment. Staff are friendly. Love stopping by with girlfriends after a day of shopping. Parking lot is small, so allow extra time on a weekend night for street parking."}
{"text":"What they have is really good. The options can be a little limiting, but that's probably what keeps the quality where it's at. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"DP is a really fun, good food kind of place for a rang of foodies from singles to families with kids-a rare dual environment. The brussel sprouts nachos may be one of the best items on the menu. Desserts are just okay, but most tacos deliver on good taste with a handy a la carte offering. Although the kitchen may be slow, ask for TAYLOR to wait on your table. She is one of a few who rises above good food so as to turn 4 stars into a 5, even to be at service to help the kitchen prepare desserts to us. 

Try this place for good food and good fun."}
{"text":"First of all this is my Fiancé and I's favorite place of all time and Rebecca one of the managers is seriously the best which compliments the food to a \"T\"!!! The food is absolutely amazing and their drinks aren't ones to over look! 

We got out engagement party catered by Diego Pops due to loving their food and becoming regulars there. Rebecca was amazing at organizing and preparing all of our food for the party and let's just say that there wasn't ANY FOOD LEFT!!! Everyone loved the food and kept asking where it was from! Highly recommended for your next event!

Our favorite items there are the:
Coconut lemongrass ceviche 
Corn queso 
The wings
Grilled Shrimp tacos or shrimp bowl
Braised green chili chicken tacos
Braised pineapple pork
Then all margaritas! The fresh one is amazing!

If you're looking for just a casual lunch out or a date night or your next event catered definitely give them a look!! 

Thank you,
Tj"}
{"text":"Diego's has become my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona! Every time I've come here the service has been exceptional and the food to die for!! Anthony was my server tonight and he did the most amazing job! He made us laugh the entire time! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try Diego Pops in Old Town because it looked so cute every time I drove by.  There was a little wait so we went to the bar . The bartender with curly hair greeted us with a not so friendly hello. My husband and I laughed at the rudeness at first but picked drinks and ordered when she gave us some attention. She slowly made my husbands drink, disappeared, helped others and chit chatted. I asked another bartender for a drink. She mentioned something to the rude bartender and then came back with an extremely rude \"she's making it and had to go in the back for you drink\". Gez is everyone rude here! Our table was ready we contemplated just leaving but really wanted tacos. The waitress came by she was very nice so we felt better. We ordered all nine of the tacos and the waitress seemed knowledgeable.  I ordered a glass of wine and it came with only a 2 oz pour. I flagged down someone and she corrected it. I watch as the lazy rude bartenders had to open another  bottle. Obviously it was too hard for the bartenders to open another bottle in the first place to accommodate the customer.  As we waited for our tacos, the people behind us had an issue. One of the rude bartenders came up to the table and pretty much scolded the customer loudly. She looked shocked and I was happy it was not just me. We got our food ate our tacos, didn't want to order another drink and got out of there. The food was ok. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! RUDE BARTENDERS!  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED POORLY. I"}
{"text":"So my uber driver informed me that Mexico cuisine is the way to go when in Arizona. We decided to check out Diego Pops, mainly attracted by the Brussel Sprout Nachos appetizer in the pictures. I don't know what that pink sauce is but it was delicious and really hit the spot. If you check in, you get a free taco and free glass of beer too! Worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The staff makes you feel like you've been coming there for years. First time here and will definitely be coming back. The green chili chicken bowl is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Totally adorable little place with amazing food and amazing vibe. Service was great, drinks were delicious (the mint watermelon margarita was on point) and the food was phenomenal. We're only in the Phoenix area for a week but we might be back for a second visit!"}
{"text":"First time going to Diego pops and the food was excellent! The staff was extremely friendly and the food is delicious! You have to try out the Brussel sprout nachos because they are spectacular and innovative! This place is a must try!!! Excellent service and great drinks too!"}
{"text":"I really like Diego pops tacos and the restaurants atmosphere. However, the customer service isn't very good and some of the servers don't have a very good attitude towards the customers."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and patio. Great drinks. Nice servers. Definitely a fun spot for lunch or just drinks."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place.

The inside has a weird 50s diner-ish look to it.  I did not like it, and next time will choose the patio area which seemed much nicer.  Our service was very good when we went.

We started with the corn queso dip.  I liked it a lot and would recommend it.

We tried a selection of the tacos.  They were good, but nothing stands out as great."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very cool, very quaint and adorable.  I love the feel of the potted plants all around outside.  My favorite of this place is the salsa!  A very simple chips and salsa but they nailed it- just the right kind of spice and flavor, very good.  My second favorite part is the selection of condiments/sauces that they bring to your table.  My husband is a huge condiments fan, I can't wait to take him here.  I didn't go full 5 stars because our server wasn't the brightest- couldn't hear me at all and didn't get my order right.  However, everything was really tasty and very reasonably priced!  Total bill for a friend and I with drinks was less than $40.  I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want great Mexican food that isn't like all the rest with an atmosphere that keeps you coming back.

From the moment you walk in you want to stay and not just for the amazing drinks and food but the open eating area, cool decor and friendly staff.

This is one place where you certainly can't go wrong with endless, tasty options on the menu that will appeal to everyone."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner. We enjoyed everything that was brought to the table and loved that there was a happy hour on a Sunday from 3-6. Half priced appetizers and some of their drinks were half priced as well. We tried their chips and salsa and guacamole to start and we ended up trying a bunch of appetizers for dinner. We had the brussel sprout nachos, mango habanero wings and their quesadilla with beet creme on top. We finished the meal with their mini churros and dipping sauces. Everything tasted great. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fresh tacos. The brussels sprout nachos are a must! Highly recommend the shrimp and pork tacos as well. If we weren't so stuffed, we'd have gotten some dessert."}
{"text":"Food was above average, worst margarita ever and very slow service.  Better places to chose from in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Sometimes places have a nice atmosphere and decent food, but they decide to hire hot chicks with not a lot happening upstairs.

I present to you, Diego Pops.

If you want to split a check, good freakin' luck.  It took 20 minutes.  

Also, my order was completely wrong (and she questioned me - nope, I don't eat pork and wouldn't have ordered pork - but thanks for willing to admit your mistake).  And drinks were never refilled.

But when our server finallllllly got the checks right (only 2, mind you), she actually exclaimed \"I DID IT!\" like a toddler undergoing potty training,"}
{"text":"It's about time old town Scottsdale offered a trendy, inexpensive, atmosphere that offers AMAZING Mexican food! Also, my favorite thing about this place is that there are healthy options! This is a great location right in the heart of old town surrounded by plenty of shops, art galleries, among many other things to do. 

Diego Pops offers both inside/outside seating. Tables, booths, couches, and bar stools. There is also a bar with more fancy drinks without the use of Tequila than I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant! Don't get me wrong...the Tequila was definitely flowing;) I'm a HUGE fan of coconut so if there are any coconut fans out there I highly recommend getting your drinks right from an actual coconut!

There was a lot of great items to choose from on the menu and my favorite go to item on this menu was the tacos. All of the tacos were great but the one that stood out from the rest was the shrimp tacos! YUMMMMMM! We had the s'mores dessert that tasted just like it was right off the campfire minus all the work it takes to make one! 

Our waitress was very attentive and the manager was present ensuring that all of the customers were receiving the best service. Overall, we loved this place for the atmosphere, food, drinks and service and will definitely frequent here!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite meal during my trip to Scottsdale and I will be going out of my way to go back again.

Like other reviewers have noted, I know that this place doesn't serve authentic Mexican food. But I don't care. The flavors are extremely well chosen and make for really tasty dishes where there's something for everyone. We did mostly tacos when we ate here and experienced a good variety of flavors that really made me wish we could have a Diego Pops here in San Diego. (Please? I mean, we're San DIEGO. We need a DIEGO Pops. Clearly!)

My absolutely favorite thing on the menu was the Street Corn Queso. Goodness, this stuff is like crack! I wanted more! However I'd ordered three tacos - which should be enough for most anyone - and those were fantastic, too. It seems that the wait staff is pretty good at giving their honest opinions on food and drink - our server had some great recommendations and I'm glad I took them - so don't be too quick to go all willy-nilly with your order. Listen to the wait staff and they'll guide you well.

The drinks were strong and tasty. I drank sangria and my boyfriend had a Mexican Mule and a Prickly Pear Margarita. I tried both and they were delicious. 

The only thing I could possibly gripe about was that we ordered a little more towards the end of our meal and it took a little while than we would've liked. No sweat, it happens. It didn't ruin the experience.

I'll be dreaming about that Street Corn Queso and trying to make my own. Or I'll be finding a way to go back to Scottsdale for another visit. I must, must, must return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great happy hour, good vibes, good drinks, and the BEST Brussel sprouts nachos EVER. I seriously would come back to Arizona just for the nachos delicious. Check this place out"}
{"text":"Went here for the $2 tacos on Monday. Meat was bland and service was poor. Only reason for three stars is the salsa which was really good"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and happened to stumble upon this gem.  Fantastic food, margaritas and even better service. Taylor could not have been more personable.  I will definitely be back when I am back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Thank you, The Mission, for having electrical problems this morning. This forced us to have to find another Mexican restaurant and we found this spectacular place. 

I had the Brussel Sprout Nachos, and my mind was blown! I love me some brussel sprouts, but would have ever thought of putting them in nachos. These are so good, you won't want to share...but will because it's a huge portion. It's got pickled onions, brussel sprouts, and two types of cheese. 

I want to come back to this place today, and I was there for lunch today. It's hipsterish, but the food was good enough for me to ignore that element."}
{"text":"We took our daughter here for her 6th Birthday, she  asked for a fun Mexican type restaurant. Glad we picked Diego Pops, our server Skyler made our birthday girl feel special and provided great service. The food was great, variety of tacos, best chips and Brussel sprout nachos are a must try. Great energy, design and the patio was perfect even in the heat. Thank you for a great family night, we will return as our girls are now in love with Choco Tacos!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but Taylor, my server chraged me $1.50 to add rocks to my tequila. Is scooping ice and putting it into a glass worth a $1.50 in service?  This is the first restaurant I've been to who does this."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! We went for the snow cone margaritas, which could have been a little better, but enjoyed the food and ambience. Service was good. Fun, we'd go back!"}
{"text":"3/5 stars

We came here on a Friday night for dinner and this restaurant was very lively!
The food and service was OK. Definitely a millennial type a scene. 

Ordered:
1) Chip and Salsa: 3/5 salsa was good. Chips were okay.
2) Guacamole: 4/5 yum!! DELICIOUS. Fresh avocado and you cast taste it!
3) Grilled shrimp taco: 3/5 eh, okay, but not for the price..
4) Braised pineapple pork: 3/5 again, okay, but not fantastic
5) Charred skirt steak: 3/5 eh, okay.

Overall, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes for drinks at 1pm. The bartender at the main bar never even considered giving service to the entire lobby side of the bar despite people sitting in seats. Watched multiple people give up and leave. Way better options for service and food in Old Town."}
{"text":"This place has Sunday Funday written all over it. All day happy hour on Sundays. Good appetizers, margs, tacos, salads and a fun lively environment made me a fan. 

Word on the street is that the ceviche and brussel sprouts nachos are good choices.  We had salads and we all enjoyed our meals. Green chile chicken was tasty and I love how my ceasar wasnt drowning in dressing, like some other places serve it. I was also intrigued as I saw poke on the menu. Trying that next time because I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was Fusion Tex-Mex and fairly good.  The salsa was excellent.  The tacos were good.  The house burrito was extremely plain.  If the service had been even standard, it would have been an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"This place is super cool. We had a large group with children and opted for the couch tables indoors. It's a great set up and the staff was wonderfully accommodating for our kiddos. We shared a pitcher of the Diego margarita which was a great deal. The Brussel sprout nachos are a must do for any future visits. Delicious! And I enjoyed the watermelon salad although I found that I couldn't make a dent after all the tasty appetizers - I saved the rest for the next day. My only complaint might be that the fun selection of sauces at our table were all very bland. I'll come back every trip to Scottsdale for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is great however, they advertise that they do orders to go and delivered through services such as door dash but any time they get the slightest bit busy, they disconnect their phone and do not accept orders on DoorDash or Postmates. Extremely annoying in my opinion"}
{"text":"This place was on my \"Places to eat at\" List. It did not disappoint! We started with the guacamole and quest and it was full of flavor. I grew up drinking horchatas, so anytime I see it on the menu I order it. This place has them and really that the reason I wanted to eat here. The horchata was delicious! Not many Mexican restaurants serve them, but this was one of the few that actually tasted authentic! Very cool and casual setting. We sat outside by the fireplace. Will be returning"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and everything about it from the food to the wait staff who are so professional and polite. The food is authentic and well-priced. Wish we had a Diego Pops in San Francisco.
Try the bowls, the guacamole and the coconut soft serve which is only $2.00!"}
{"text":"Updated... Happy Hour menu isn't accurate pricing. It's confusing on a couple items and the manager is a jerk. Still crappy service but food is delicious!! 

First Visit.... Stopped in for my first time last night.  Wanted to be in and out as I was on a dinner break from work. The place was busy at 845pm but not full.  Stood at the host stand for 5 min and nobody even said a word to me. Finally a spot opened at the bar so I grabbed it.  Took another 5 min for the bartender to greet me and take my drink order. I ordered iced green tea to drink and it was delicious and SO refreshing. I decided to order a few happy hour items to try. I got the braised green chili Quesadilla (Tasted AMMMAAAAZZIIINGG), Chips and Salsa (Both yummy), and the Fish Taco (yummy) . However the food took 40 min to arrive!!!! The server had poor communication, then The server tried to say it was the Quesadilla holding up everything and said they can only cook 3 at a time. Not a good excuse. Another bartender helped me towards the end, she was more helpful and better personality.  Hoping the service is better next time, I will be back to try tacos and that delicious Quesadilla!! 

They have Happy Hour all day on Sundays and Monday is Taco Monday."}
{"text":"Awesome food, especially the nachos. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great spot. Prices are reasonable, food was very good, and it was a fun atmosphere. One downside: the parking was tough. We had to pay $6 for valet. But it was worth it. The Brussels sprout nachos were surprisingly great. Definitely recommend for a good spot to eat out with friends. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"I'm in love, every restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale has been spectacular and this was no exception. It's for the food options alone that I'd love to live here but I can visit so that's a plus!
 We enjoyed the chip appetizer and boy it was lovely to enjoy especially with the unique sauces offered.
 I ordered the Caesar salad with shrimp add on and used about half the dressing along with some of the other sauces for a scrumptious meal! BE SURE to note the check in offer of taco and beer!
 Oh and the Mexican mule was really something, the margarita was good as well but must be enjoyed slowly to avoid brain freeze"}
{"text":"the tacos were good. house marg was ok as to be expected. mint lime marg was amazing. over all the service was good. but i feel bad for the employees here the dark long hair manager behind the bar is super awful to her bartenders and bar backs"}
{"text":"My first order: a Charred Skirt Steak Bowl with brown rice. 

Everything from the steak to the beans were prepared amazingly. I don't even know how to articulate how incredible everything tasted. I ended up coming back again the next day for dinner. That night, I decided to try a Bowl with a different protein: the Braised Green Chili Chicken. And my verdict is: just as incredible."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Bartenders are always great! Rebecca and Jessica make your day."}
{"text":"My wife and i ate at Diego Pops and it was decent, but not great. I ordered the house burrito and my wife ordered a salad with salmon, we also ordered a beer and a snow cone margarita. 

The burrito was good, but had a few bones and was not the most filling. I personally like really hot sauces and tried all of their house made sauces and none of them were hot, but did have good flavor. 

My wife's salad was pretty good size and she got a good chunk of salmon. 

The snow cone margarita has very very little alcohol and literally tastes like a snow cone, we ordered the watermelon and lime. 

The local beer was excellent, it was the hop knot ipa from 4 peaks in Tempe. It's a great tasting beer and not overly hoppy. 

It was great to try it, but i honestly would not go back."}
{"text":"The street Corn queso appetizer was phenomenal!! I enjoyed the braised green chili chicken Taco and the beef machaca Taco. The meats were cooked very well, but they needed sauces (given) to add flavor. There was a green sauce that was amazing on both, and the pink sauce (color deceiving) was delicious and garlicky! My boyfriend has the shrimp bowl and also said it was a tad bland, but with added salsa and sauces it was good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Brussels sprout nachos!!!! Fabulous!!!!! The staff is great! The owner fabulous!"}
{"text":"WTF is going on? I showed up on a random Thursday night with a party of four last night. The restaurant appeared to be about 1/4 full. There were spaces at the bar, huge empty tables, 4 tops, booths and two tops all appearing ready for the sitting. There looked to be ample servers and bartenders to adequately service the entire place.
We were greeted by a woman that all but told us to go away. Actually, that is what she said.
\"Look, our kitchen is backed up, it's going to be at least an hour wait. Tonight isn't a good night.\"
We questioned that for a minute, then conferred among ourselves. We decided we weren't in a hurry. We hadn't seen this group of people in so long that there would be a lot of catching up to do. 
We went back to the woman and let her know we were happy waiting. We'd just go to the bar and have a few drinks. 
\"No, you won't. We don't have any clean glasses.\"
The one couple at the bar turned around wide eyed and told us to \"just leave. Seriously, it's horrible. We ordered an appetizer a half hour ago and we can't even get a drink.\"
Seriously. What the f is going on?"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Diego Pops! Great food, cool atmosphere, and the manager Rebecca is awesome ! Shes sharp, makes great drinks and suggestions! A unique spot I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The brussels sprouts nachos are so good! They do tend to close early, but it is a great place for lunch or dinner. They are right in Old Town, so it is easy to walk to other bars in the area."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here after trying their tacos at the AZ Taco Festival however they left us pretty disappointed. They didn't taste near as good or fresh which I found odd because they were AMAZING at the festival. 

We did get to try the Brussels sprout nachos and now I am OBSESSED. I will be back for these and the yummy margaritas. Our service was great as well!"}
{"text":"I don't ask for much in a dining experience. I don't have any weird allergies or ask for a million sides of ranch. I tip. Really, I am just looking for my server to be attentive and have mild social skills. Our server fell below this standard and that was really disappointing. 

The ambiance & design of this place is adorable. The food is creative & different. Everything we ordered was delicious- the corn queso, the playa poke, the tacos, & the churro sundae! It was a good temperature with great presentation. Once we asked for the sauces, they were a fun element. We just never saw our waitress and waited a long time between ordering courses. Our app was never bussed...even though we had scraped every bit of delicious queso out of the bowl.


I'd go back and try it again- maybe for happy hour or the nachos."}
{"text":"Jessica is an awesome server. She was friendly and professional. The food was served promptly and was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal. We had the Brussel sprout nachos and I honestly can't believe how good they were. I was willing to trade one of my sisters for these nachos. The coconut margarita is great because you get to eat the meat from your coconut :). My husband and I sat at the bar and Rebecca was our server, she was GREAT! Very attentive, knew our names and checked on us often. We will be visiting much more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Had their BBQ chicken bowl and crispy cod bowl. The crispy cod was excellent, just enough fish and crispness to work together! Definitely recommend choosing the coconut rice, it's very different. Also, the roasted garlic beet sauce is very tangy and very good. 

Had their chocolate coconut sundae, a bit disappointed because no hard shell of chocolate so it was mostly just coconut ice cream but it was very good soft serve and their coconut whipped cream is fantastic!! Would definitely recommend this place, it's also very trendy and the ambience is casual and fun."}
{"text":"35 minute wait for tacos to come out cold. 3 stars because waitress took them off the bill. Food was decent but cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Diego Pops since they opened and it keeps getting better. The nachos are my favorite thing on the menu but don't miss the Fruity Pebbles dessert and the green chili chicken."}
{"text":"Great vibes in the heart of Scottsdale! Very colorful set up with plenty of neon signs to take group photos in front of. Venue has a old school Miami color feel coupled with tasty tacos and margaritas. Plenty of shopping in the immediate surrounding area or places to start late night festivities"}
{"text":"Really good surprise! They have some fun things and different twist on menu. We got chips n guac which both were good, then i got this hot dog that was bomb and we shared haberno wings. I also got this shaved ice margarita that was tasty! Ill be back. Another plus is that its not grease mexican!!
Also happy hr sunday 3-6, half off apps, sangria, wine, beer. Pretty good !!!"}
{"text":"Definitely for foodies! Excellent drinks and tacos. The brussel sprout nachos shouldn't be missed"}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere! 

The tacos were mighty tasty and their sauces are quite unique. We enjoyed our meal very much. We've had tacos from Oaxaca to California to Texas and back. So it's safe to say we have had enough tacos to give you an opinion worth taking. 

The pork and pineapple taco was perfect and the hint of pineapple was not overwhelming. The shrimp taco was spot on. I think it was my favorite.  The green chili taco was a bit spicy but good. The skirt steak taco was tender and flavorful. The cod taco was pretty good, nothing spectacular but good.  So Diego Pops gets an A+ for their tacos!

The margaritas on the other hand were just ok. Kinda weak. We've had so much better. 
Still this place gets a 5star. It's not their fault the bartender is stingy with the tequila."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.
Here is my recommendation:
If you're feeling tacos, get the tacos- delicious.
But get the BOWL!!! 

So tasty and filling! Plus you have leftovers for lunch!

Drinks are delicious too, I liked the Mexican mule! But then again I am Mexican and anything Mexican is always great ;)"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place with a slightly hip vibe. On our first visit, ordered a couple of bowls and some queso after reading its favorable reviews. Seriously, the queso was very bland and had a curdled appearance and grainy texture and was lukewarm.  The bowls were ok, but mine was not composed with my bean of choice, and the waiter obviously didn't remember what I ordered and guessed while placing it in front of me.The bottom of my bowl was watery, perhaps from black beans and mushy brown rice?  I thought that the pork tasted as though it was marinated in a can of pineapple juice-- with a slight tinny taste.
I'm feeling sad for previous reviewers who think this it really good Mexican food. Where have you been eating all of this time, Taco Bell? This food is terrible!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. A lot of healthy choices.  Had the Adobe Chile Chicken bowl  which is fantastic. Had the chicken soup as an appetizer and it tasted great, but all of the cheese melted and was at the bottom of the soup. It is a very casual atmosphere. The food comes out quickly.  Did not have dessert but they have soft serve coconut ice cream. Thy have a choices of sauces for the tacos and bowls that tasted good.  Service was good and quick. Thy have private parking right in front of the restaurant. They have a huge outdoor patio with heaters."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing the pink nachos on yelp. First of all, this place is so adorable and the food is delicious. If you check into yelp, you get a taco and huge glass of beer for five dollars. Basically, you get a free beer because one taco is around $4.50- $5.00. 
I ordered a taco and we shared the artichoke nachos. The taco was good and I loved their selection of sauces. Some of my favorite sauces were the pink beet sauce and creamy cilantro sauce. 
The artichoke nachos were delicious. They were crunchy and had a lot of cheese melted throughout. It had the delicious pink beet sauce drizzled on top of it. 
I loved this place and I'm glad we stopped here to get lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Scottsdale.  We went to Diego Pops on Sunday evening and absolutely loved it. The service was great, the tacos even better. It was so good in fact that I took my friend there today for lunch.  My husband was jealous so I took him for dinner!  That's how much we loved this place!  We will be coming back--just for their awesome food!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the service is terrible. Fire the entire lunch crew except the kitchen. The two
Chefs were the only people working in there today. Boo. Rude waitresses."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place - I was super excited for Mexican food, and I loved the decor and the vibe when we came in, but I don't think I picked the right food, and the service was unfortunately not as good as I'd hoped. 

We were a large group, but the restaurant wasn't very busy so it seemed like it would be fine. We had pre-ordered appies and the brussel sprout nachos were seriously to. die. for. They were outstanding! 5 stars for those, that's for sure! The sprouts were cooked perfectly and the cheese and sauce on the nachos complimented them so well - the fried egg was an added creamy bonus! The guacamole was also delicious, very fresh!

For my main I should have got tacos but decided to be healthy and get a salad. I asked the server which salad was best (I was indecisive and trying to be quick) and she suggested the Caesar. Usually I'm not a Caesar fan, but this had purple kale, corn, and avocado (YUM) so I thought I'd give it a shot. She asked if I wanted to add meat and I took her suggestion of the BBQ chicken. 

When my food arrived I was disappointed to see it was mostly romaine with very small pieces of purple kale. The 'croutons' were tortilla chips, which was unique but I wish they had stated that on the menu. The chicken was my least favourite part as I found it quite flavourless, unfortunately. The salad was ok but not something I'd order again.

The rest of our table's food trickled in slowly with a couple of small errors to our orders. One of our party asked three times for tortillas, and by the time they finally arrived he took three bites of his food and had to leave. 

I would come back with a much smaller group and try some of their other food - the nachos alone would make me come back! I just wouldn't have the salad again..."}
{"text":"Great food, super atmosphere, friendly service. The tacos are very  filling , start with two  and  add more if needed!"}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped by for our first taco stop while visiting Arizona.

Atmosphere: trendy and fun indoor seating with bright colors. Outside patio area is great for enjoying a warm day and feels like summer all year with the nicely hung Edison bulbs and tropical-vibe bar.

Service: 4 of us sat at the bar one afternoon due to lack of outdoor seating and our server was excellent. She was friendly and attentive without being too much which is my favorite. 

Food: I turned to trusty Yelp and ordered the brussels sprouts nachos with egg to share. We each ordered a different taco bowl and liked them. I decided on the flank steak taco bowl over brown rice and black beans. It was a decent-sized portion that I was unable to finish after the nachos. It doesn't taste \"authentic\" but that wasn't a surprise really. Topped it off with a margarita and was happy. 

Interesting place with unique options that will feel a bit overpriced if you're looking for authentic Mexican food. Nevertheless, still good if you set your expectations appropriately."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed here! I went for their taco Monday this week where all tacos are 3 dollars! I also got the corn queso which is one of the best queso dips I've ever had! The service was wonderful! We had a spirited young lady who made sure we had everything we needed, she split the bill appropriately and even gave us to go waters! I couldn't have been happier! I get the plantain tacos which are vegetarian and a phenomenal twist to a taco!!"}
{"text":"I have had take out here several times for lunch.  The food is always awesome and ready to go when I get there.  I liked it so much and always wanted to sit outside on their adorable patio, so my fiance and I decided to venture away from downtown and try it for dinner this past Sunday evening.  We were seated immediately but our server was nowhere in sight.  It was at least 5 minutes before she even acknowledged us.  When she finally appeared, we ordered some drinks and appetizers....and then she disappeared again.  For a long time.   She finally came back (empty-handed) and took our dinner order.  She told us both the bar and the kitchen were running behind.  It was a fairly slow evening but we were understanding.  The drinks and appetizers were eventually delivered by a different person.  Everything was just beyond slow and took forever to come out, including our entrees.  Yet a third person (bartender?) brought us our second round of drinks at some point.  We asked her for extra tortillas and they never came.  Our server never checked back on us until we were done with our meal.  I'll reiterate - I love the food here.  And the patio is so quaint and cute.  But the service stinks.  I think I will stick with lunch take out."}
{"text":"I was staying in the Scottsdale area for business and wanted to go to a cool place for lunch. It was warm and wanted to sit out on the patio and found Diego Pops on Yelp. When I walked up I could automatically tell that this was a very hip and trendy place (which was great). The decor made me feel like I was in Palm Springs (I am from CA) and I loved it. It felt very retro. I sat at the bar outside to work and the waitress Destiny was great. Very sweet and personable. I was not able to get on their wifi, but I signed up to this Cox internet trial for an hour and was able to complete my work. 

I ordered the chips and salsa to start (only $2). They bring them on a small cookie sheet and the salsa that comes with it is very good. Then they also give you an array of sauces to use. Stuff like Beet creme, Jalapeno ranch, habanero oil, etc. Next I ordered two tacos, the fried cod and the beef machaca. They were both very good. They have taco and bowl options. I recommend the taco for the fish and a bowl for the beef. The beef is amazing and very juicy so it broke the tortilla automatically. I think having it in a bowl would have made it better. But still delicious. I also had the watermelon mint marg which was good, but I must say it wasn't very strong for being $10."}
{"text":"Although advertised as dog friendly, it is not. Not permitted to provide water to dogs in 95 degree weather due to \"health code\". Have never been to \"dog friendly\" place where this has ever been an issue. Dog lovers should avoid."}
{"text":"Cool spot, great tacos, and chips/guac were also good. Busy , younger crowd and the menu is basically a bunch of unique tacos along with some appetizer and drink options. Nice addition to Sdale."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, the food was great but the service sucked. The outside patio was nice and the margaritas were good too!"}
{"text":"I love the Brussel Sprout Nachos here!  I usually like to try something different when I go back to restaurants, but I just can't here because they are so good."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Ate the skirt steak, creamy pinto beans, and coconut rice. Very fresh and tasty. Nice, welcoming atmosphere. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Would def return."}
{"text":"We went here during the Phoenix Open, and we're lucky enough to get a table for 9 of us. The restaurant is super cute with neon signs and pineapple wallpaper. The queso is tasty, and the grilled steak tacos were good. I like how they come a la carte so you can try different ones. I wasn't crazy about the service. Don't think I'd necessarily go back, but that's partially because I eat tacos all the time being from Austin. ;)"}
{"text":"this is a great taco shop they have taco Monday instead of taco Tues there tacos are 2 to 3 on Monday great deal and good food"}
{"text":"I went to Diego Pops with my friends for the first time  and my server Anthony was very cheerful and very informative. He told us all about taco Monday and recommended the Guava coconut since we all wanted the prickly pear margaritas.
He also gave us a great recommendation about the steak tacos and adding pineapple and jalapeños.
It was absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend asking for him to help you out."}
{"text":"I really want to give it a 2.5.. I ordered charred steak tacos, poke bowl, queso and chips, and everything was bland. They forgot about the queso and chips so they had to comp it. But there was no flavor just sent it back.. and for my charred steak tacos I had to add: Salt, Serrano ranch, lime, the salsa they provide, and garlic beet crema. Seriously to make it good? And Poke bowl, lol I did not finish it, the rice was mush. Tuna was warm. But The place was cute. I like the decor. Server was awesome but I felt rushed because he gave us the check super quick.

NOTE: The only good thing here was the chips."}
{"text":"Love the tacos, chicken tortilla soup, and salads.  The salsas are wonderful.  I can't wait until we return."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant especially if you are staring there for a night out in old town. 

Had a few of the tacos As bowls and found them to be great!  Also enjoyed the snow-cone margaritas."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great pitchers of margs, inventive menu! Came here from out of town on cinco de mayo. Stayed for hours and had a blast. Will definitely return next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. Our experience Saturday June 16 around 10pm and this was the first and last time I will ever walk into Diego Pops. Upon arriving we sat down at the bar and asked the bartender what they recommended because it was our first time. Acting annoyed that we even asked they said we are known for our Brussels sprouts nachos which we said didn't sound good at the moment. We then said we were feeling something seafood, and again they told us to get the nachos with disgust. Sitting there with no good recommendation we asked the gentleman next to us what he was having, and we asked for the same thing. What we received was not the same thing. When we asked about it the bartender seemed annoyed that we even said anything. To try and ignore this awful experience we got to know the nice guy next to us. After a nice conversation, the fellow offered to buy us drinks. He asked the bartender if she could get us drinks and she proceeded to tell him she refuses to serve him or us. Clearly confused because we had nothing wrong or obscure to prompt that the nice man asked for the manager at the time. Cory the manager then proceeded to yell at the gentleman when he explained the situation, making us feel unsafe and very uncomfortable. After yelling at the nice man for a few minutes Cory then tried to offer us coupons. We refused and said we will never be returning here again. And the icing on the cake was when the bartender tried to keep our change. Absolutely awful experience, terrible service, and the management was just as bad."}
{"text":"Okay okay... someone please bring this place some freaking salt. There's nothing that bothers me more then food that I can tell no one has checked for seasoning. Tacos were ok. I feel like the ingredients of the taco were interesting and good on paper but nothing was executed well. Shrimp taco was the highlight so I recommend that. Also pineapple pork one was pretty good. The cilantro brown rice was BRUTAL. So clearly underdone and had literally zero salt in it. It tasted like oatmeal. Atmosphere and staff was good however. Overall it was okay but if you want good tacos just go somewhere else or bring your own salt."}
{"text":"Interior Design: 
Tacos: 
Service: 
Yelp Check-in deal  &  for $5:   

I loved this place. So cheap compared to similar places near my home in Miami Beach!! Gr at style and great service. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for dinner and drinks and the bartender was too busy to give us good service. This was my second time there and the first time was great fun and food. This time the avocado ceasar salad was terrible."}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids, sat on the patio, had some great margaritas and the Brussels sprouts nachos (delicious way to get the veggies in). The steak bowl with creamy pinto beans and quinoa was fantastic and my wife said her chicken bowl with coconut rice was equally good. The kids were happy with quesadillas and burritos, and chips and salsa. Taylor took great care of us, rounding out a great experience. The parking lot is tight so take advantage of one of the nearby valet lots and save yourself some time for more margaritas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for instagram photos! The drinks are super yummy and cute. The tacos aren't the best, but the vibe is fun and perfect for its Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night and waited at the host stand for 10 minutes before we decided to just sit at the bar. Front was leaking from the ceiling so they had buckets. There was no hostess. They should probably start scheduling one. The food was okay. We sat at the bar outside and the bartenders were nice. I had a breakfast burrito and it tasted like any other. The cheese quesadilla with chicken tasted good. What I liked best about my meal had to be the chocolate taco. I would come here again and give it another chance. I mean, it was raining."}
{"text":"Bad Margs...Way too sour! Horrible plate presentation! It actually looked like someone had eaten off of this plate already. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star, is the sklrt steak taco was decent. Skip this place, and go to the Mission."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio. Awesome taco selection plus a ton of sauces and some really spicey! Open for lunch and Mondays really cheap tacos."}
{"text":"First visit. Great location. Next to Montauk. Has a small dedicated parking lot with 9-10 spaces. 
Service was great (Taylor was very helpful with menu choices). Brussels sprout nachos are a house specialty and real good. Portion is enough for 4-6 people. Had the poke - it was just ok. Needs more tuna and less fillers. 
Great patio but we ate inside as it was too hot. 
Nice happy hour menu too. 
We'll be back !"}
{"text":"As we were waiting for a table to open up (an hour wait) at The Breakfast Club we happened to walk down the road looking at the other restaurants menus... As we walked up to Diego Pops a guy was going in and told us that is was a great place and he comes here all the time, so we decided to give it a try. 
The decor is trendy but comfortable and the staff was immediately inviting and welcoming.  The menu all looked amazing so the owner gave us some good pointers... Some of which were their award winners!
We tried the guacamole which was great, the chips were really good too and the salsa was fresh and homemade.
The wings were Deeelish! The grill was a great touch.  They were a little bit sweet with heat at the back which was perfect.
The shrimp tacos were the BOMB! Going back just for those for sure! 
They also have some amazing sauces that you could literally drink.
Great place to go and it didn't seem like the crowd was too young :)"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and the service has been okay along with the food. Recently went and the manager had an issue with my friend and made our group feel horrible. Service was down hill from there. The place had maybe 20 customers and we were ignored. Then when we ordered the waitress/bar tender spoke over my friends conversations to keep asking about what tortilla we wanted. We were never checked on during the service. Also drinks were ordered and were taken from the table even if they were not finished. Not worth it!!"}
{"text":"Very loud slow innatentive service. Food? Who knows waiting 30 minutes already and no sign of it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, been ignored by the server for the last half hour.  Food was decent, but how hard is it to check in on us once in a while.  Wasn't even busy so there was no excuse. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon and Jessica and Kailey were amazing! Drinks were ice cold and perfect!!! The staff is so nice and are so fun!!!! Love this Place!"}
{"text":"Diego Pops has the best street tacos I've had in a restaurant so far! Yes, tacos are the thing right now and everybody is doing them, but Diego Pops is doing them the best. I've tried various types here and all of them have been delicious.

The atmosphere is great and you can sit inside or outside. Service was fast and attentive and our food was out in no time! I can definitely see this being a regular place to go and it would also be a great place to start, or end, and evening out in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fantastic drinks. The wait staff was prompt with our order and the Prickly Pear is the beat Margarita I have ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork taco and the shrimp taco and they were so good! I love the array of sauces to choose from. My favorite was the green sauce and, of course, their signature pink sauce. I also had the cheese quesadilla, which wasn't very good because it was dry and didn't have enough cheese. The interior wasn't my favorite, but I didn't know what to expect since I happened to pass by Diego Pops by chance and decided tacos sounded good. Oh, and they had choco tacos as one of the desert options!"}
{"text":"Went here and had a great experience. The queso dip was different and really flavorful. The Sonoran hot dog was reasonably priced and tasty. Also had a shrimp taco which was probably my favorite. For dessert we shared the churro fries. Super fun way to finish the meal. All of this was made even better by our rad server, Shantel. She was very helpful and sweet. We will be returning here to try more of this place's unique tacos and their variations of hot sauces."}
{"text":"I know that lots of people have said they like going here but I have to admit, compared to all the other amazing food places in Old Town, this is just not worth the trip. The salsa was terrible and very hot. When we asked for less spicy they brought over some tubes filled with different colored mayo products...it was so gross. Then the tacos came out and all the meat was burned and tasted old. The drinks were okay but not anything special. The snowcone had very little alcohol in it and even the waitress was surprised at how little effort they put into it. The de ore was old and the walls echoed terribly so we had to scream to hear one another. This may be a fun hang out bar but definitely do not come here for the food. Service was great which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Classic street taco joint. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about either. Got to sit outside on a beautiful day/evening and enjoy some tacos and tell my fiance that she is beautiful.

I liked that the chips were a mix of classic corn chips and banana chips. Bomb!

Food came out pretty quick.

I'd like to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Meh- my reaction to eating at Diego pops last night. The tacos were mediocre at best and quite frankly for the whole \"trendy street taco craze\" there are so many better places. The actual servers were very on top it, polite and speedy. The food was kind of cold and way over priced. The margarita was strong, but not worth 10$. I probably wouldn't recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Some of the best original salsa and a good variety of original tacos."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Jon was our waiter and he was EXCELLENT. The energy coming from this guy made our dining experience even greater. Very cute indoor/outdoor space decor and art. Even the bathrooms were in theme. 
We had the shrimp ceviche, adobo chicken bowl, grilled chicken bowl & steak chicken bowl. All were excellent. 
Appetizers: The salsa was ok and the guac was pretty good. We weren't impressed with the street corn though. Favorite drink: Guava Coconut. Yum! 
We will be back again. Thanks, Jon!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The first time we came in there was a bit of a wait, it was taco Monday and I had no clue, the manager was quick to seat is and gave us a free appetizer, and the service was great! Now we go one a week and everyone remembers my daughters difficult order lol and Levi always is the best server, my drinks always full! Love the bbq taco!"}
{"text":"We frequently go to Diego Pops because it is walking distance from work. We have done group lunches there and I've also met non-work friends there to introduce them to the amazing food there. The service has always been amazing. The food is even better. I've only had one issue there (accidentally had pineapple on my salad which wasn't supposed to come with pineapple) and it was resolved very quickly. If you are vegetarian I recommend the House Salad and add avocado. The chips and guacamole are a must-have also. They have some unique options of iced tea as well as other drinks. The decor is adorable and the restaurant is always clean including the bathrooms."}
{"text":"We have been coming here weekly for over a year. Over the last few months the service here has gotten worse and worse each week. Today was the final straw. Service at the bar was atrocious to say to least. Had to order my drink twice before it finally arrived. Never offered a water. Put an appetizer order in. Had to ask for utensils/napkin. Never asked if I wanted another drink despite being empty the entire time I was there. Had to order the pork bowl twice because the first guy at the bar never actually entered the order in the computer. Had to ask for the check after 15 minutes of sitting after we were all done. Just overall terrible service. Again, this wasnt a one-time event; every week it has gotten worse. Which is unfortunate, because the food here is really good. But with so many other restaurants in Old Town don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"The best way to describe Diego Pops is amazing, flavorful and unique Mexican food and drinks with a funky but chill vibe and great service!"}
{"text":"The food tasted decent. I had the brussel sprout nachos. Hubby had plantain tacos the spin oh and mushrooms served with it had not taste. I am surprised the waitress let us order so much food. In my opinion they should inform you about sizes, then again large portions are good right? I the prices were fair. The sauces were brought to us and were warm and almost all empty. Luckily the bus boy got is cold ones since our waitress didn't seem to care. The sauces for the tacos were a nice variety but I don't like the idea of cream sauces that are warm. Especially when we were there for an early dinner 5pm. Can't imagine they kept all Evening. The coconut rice was way too sweet! We will probably try other Mexican places before returning to this one."}
{"text":"I'm in Scottsdale for vacation and decided to try this place based on the reviews.  I ordered the grilled salmon bowl and as I was eating I saw a roach crawling in the bowl.  My drink and chips were comped (of course) but this was very disappointing as I was really looking forward to trying this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the Brussels sprout nachos, several tacos, chips and salsa (spicy!) and some margaritas. Everything was amazing and a great deal during Taco Monday/happy hour. The atmosphere is very laid back and fun with an awesome patio. I don't usually write many reviews, but we haven't even left this place and I had to hop on here. Our waiter is probably the best we've ever had-he is very attentive, helpful, and friendly without being overbearing. Beyond impressed with the service we received tonight. Ask for Steve next time you are here!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here based on the reviews, but I was sadly disappointed. The restaurant design and atmosphere was amazing. The menu was also creative and definitely something different from your average Mexican restaurant. 
The let-down was after the food came. I ordered a a steak taco and a chicken adobo taco with an horchata. My husband ordered coconut ceviche and more tacos. Our tacos were served cold and lacked flavor. The salsa was okay. No limes were served with our tacos. To top it off, service was horrible. We waited so long for our food to come out and our waiter was practically non-existent. 
Don't think we will ever be coming back. Maybe for happy hour? But not for food."}
{"text":"*UPDATE* Went back (for just dinner) with friends from out of town... Probably won't be back! Our waitress - maybe she was knew - couldn't answer our menu questions to save her life, had no idea about the sauces, was very inattentive, and couldn't even tell us what type of food DP's actually served!! From being sat, to ordering an app, to finally ordering an entree... was about 25+ minutes, mind you there's no food actually coming to us during that time, not even chips... and she got flustered when some people starting asking  questions. I had even asked another server (b/c ours disappeared) to bring me a tortilla to snack on - NEVER GOT IT!  And word to the wise: if you don't see it on the menu, don't ask for it! They can't do it! Yes, DP's has nachos, which comes with melted cheese, but ask them to melt cheese on your burrito, and it takes 3 people chatting it up for one person to come tell us NO!... yet no one ever asked the kitchen guys! And don't ask them to make a smothered burrito (enchilada style), because they can't do that either. Huh? You have giant bottles of hot sauce... just pour it on top. On top of all that - my diet cokes (all 2 of them b/c our server never asked if we wanted a refill... we had to seek her out) kept coming to me kind of warm, with practically melted/no ice.  All around - bad experience and won't recommend Diego Pop's anytime soon. 

~~~~~~~~
First time here - haven't even finished eating yet - and already know that I will be back!!
I'm having a braised pineapple pork taco and a beef machaca taco... both are we're tender and delicious. Also got a side of creamy pinto beans (yes, basically refried beans) - still good - came with some chips on the side. Staff were friendly and made sure I had everything/needed anything else. The owner came and introduced himself. 
So yeah... great, chill, relaxed venue. Large doors that are kept open - so the fresh air is really nice!
Completely recommend Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and ingredients very fresh! The hostess was beyond rude and not at all inviting. She didn't look up when we entered but proceeded to hold up a finger signaling us \"one moment.\" We asked politely to move tables from inside to outside shortly after we were seated. The same hostess acted like this was the most difficult task we could have asked. The restaurant was less than half full. We even caught her whispering to another waitress about us. Outside area is very pretty and nice atmosphere. Service was extremely slow to get to us outside. Once one waiter realized no one had attended to us for about 15min after being seated he took charge. He provided us speedy service and was very friendly. Overall I liked the food here and was grateful for the waiter we finally did get. This will not stop me from sharing my poor hostess experience with anyone asking about this new restaurant. It is inexcusable."}
{"text":"People ask where the best tacos in Scottsdale are and this is it! I would recommend requesting Anthony for your waiter. He was entertaining and provided us with great service. The food was phenomenal as always. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I feel very conflicted writing the review, but at this point, I can say I won't be returning here.

Pros: Brussel sprout Nachos are to die for. Atmosphere/decor is nice too.

Cons: Service. it was disappointing having to valet on a weeknight during the summer. My friends and I walked in behind another group. There was already a large group in the entrance waiting as well. We stood for 5 mins and none of the staff members even looked our way. 

Eventually, we approached a waiter near the bar who was rude and told us to wait to be seated, and we said there had been no host and we'd been waiting for quite some time. He said our name would get put down on the list and that there was a 15 minute wait even though a majority of the patio tables were open. We head back to the entrance the hostess comes up to us saying \"I thought you were with the big group\", so in that case she didn't have a good sense of her surroundings. She immediately seated us, so that other waiter was misinformed as well and lacked empathy.

Overall the staff seemed very unapologetic and unhappy. Not a lot of smiling going around, and it was awkward being on the patio with the male waiter we'd spoken to helping every other tables but ours, since we were assigned a different female waitress. You could tell he was trying to avoid us and it was blatantly obvious.

The nachos are so good but there are so many other good restaurants in town, so I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great, newer taco place. The vibe is young and upbeat. The taco selections are awesome. Service at the patio bar was not the best. There were dirty glasses on the bar for the duration of my time there. Drinks took a long time for me and for other patrons near me sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Such good tacos! The corn queso was so good! Loved everything about this place! Very nice owners and managers! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Brussels sprout nachos were really good.  Margaritas were decent.  There were 3 of us for dinner and we each had a different rice bowl and all agreed, they were just ok. Really thought they could of had more flavor.  They forgot to bring the little tray of sauces.  Once we had that and tried some, that helped to add flavor. I would go back again for happy hour. Nice patio."}
{"text":"OMG yummm!!! Started out with the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole, then had the Green Chili Crispy Tacos with Pinto Beans and Rice! It was delicious!! Ambience is fantastic and the Palombas were excellent! We will go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Diego Pops is a beautifully designed restaurant with amazing food that mixes traditional Mexican dishes with gourmet creativity and flare.  Add beautifully crafted cocktails and excellent service and it is guaranteed to be a perfect experience."}
{"text":"The worst tacos I have ever put in my mouth. They were cold and tasteless. I have no idea why this place is still even open. They need to go to phoenix to get some lessons on how to make a good tasting taco. For $5 I expected for these tacos to close my mind! I barely swallowed them down, I only finished eating them because I paid over $20 for it. I'd pass on this place if I were you."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  They have empty tables that they won't pull up an extra seat to a table  that has plenty of room for it to fit.  Bartenders yell at you to get out of the way. It's policy they say and I guess its policy for bartenders to yell at you also.  We were just looking for a fun place to have a meal."}
{"text":"Where do I start???  The decor is amazing. The patio is so well done. The people are a unique mix of fun. This place has a great atmosphere evidenced by everyone smiling. Now for the food. The menu is.simple but the chefs suggestions are spot on. I had fish, carne asada and chicken tacos. All were top notch. I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and tasting the unique flavors."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite restaurant of all time. I've been here twice and both times were absolutely amazing. Cutest decor, it feels like a vacation. 

And the food. Ugh, I could go on forever about how great it is. The chips and salsa are even amazing, and that's just the start. Try the brussel sprout nachos. I know it sounds strange, but trust me. They're to die for. All of the tacos are great, but my go to is the beef machaca. Try it with the green chili sauce. YUM. I would eat it every day. 

Even the drinks are so fun! From a great classic marg, to the guava coconut drink, can't go wrong. (See the pictures for the guava coconut... it comes served in a real coconut and a little umbrella!!) 

I wish this place was closer to me because I would actually be here all the time. DEFINITELY try this place."}
{"text":"Snow cone margaritas were awesome. Queso was bland. Skirt steak tacos were the best thing I tried. Cilantro lime rice was ok but also bland. I loved the snow cone margaritas!"}
{"text":"We went in had the tacos and they were amazing! Loved the chips & salsa & that was also delish. Margaritas some of the best we've had. We went during lunch time and it was easy to get seated. Parking is a little tight if you're driving a bigger vehicle if you park up front so park in the back."}
{"text":"Taco Monday is the best!  Awesome food, great drink specials, wonderful service- will for sure return!"}
{"text":"This place started bad in book. I went to order a drink from the bar, and in a very Scottsdale tone he told me \"it will be a few minutes\" and completely walked away. The dude wasn't doing anything that would require him to delay making a simple drink. The food was decent, but at the end the waitress completely screwed up the tabs. I'm literally still sitting here 45 minutes after this started and we are waiting for her to come back. Needless to say this will be the last time I bring friends here. Highly don't recommend this place unless you have the patience of a Buddhist monk. 

Update- she just came back and everything is still wrong and we have waited forever for nothing."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Stopped for an early dinner but won't ever go back. Very slow service. So loud you can't have a conversation. Our order was lost so we waited a long time. Beef tacos were ok but $4.50 per taco is pretty steep. Green chili chicken stew was very bland. No accommodation was offered for the problems we encountered. When we walked to our car in the valet area about 20 feet from the front door we were charged $6. No signs anywhere about the cost of valet. Most places in Old Town offer complimentary valet. 
There are so many good restaurants in Old Town cross this one off your list."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere and great happy hour. Been coming here a long time. Margaritas are the bomb!  Jessica and Nick are the best bartenders. Always great food. Have to sit outside on the right day!"}
{"text":"Taco Monday is where it's at! Also, get the Brussels sprouts nachos, so unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had great vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free/celiac options. Our waitress was super friendly and the environment was hip & cool. Definitely will visit again if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"More Taco Monday madness. 

Guacamole at $7 was nice and chunky, fairly no frills with just cheese on top
Grilled Shrimp Taco - $3 - best taco of the night, loaded with corn and good shrimp
The Treat bar - Most of these sundaes are about $5. We tried the Smores which had all the smores ingredients, but the \"ice cream\" was actually that frozen soft serve stuff. So it seems like your getting a good deal, but it wasn't bad and is a cool ending to your meal. 

Patio still nice and even had a good waitress."}
{"text":"Beyond tasty!  Fresh flavors and healthy options, how can this be Mexican food?  Trust me just go. Have the Brussels sprout nachos and die at how good the mix of flavors are. What a creative chef. I also loved the jicama radish and cu umber side with chipotle greek yogurt dip. Had a green chili chicken taco and hubby had skirt steak platter. Tons of leftovers. Margaritas were perfect. Service five star. Adorable inside and out but we sat outside. Just go, go now!!!"}
{"text":"Simple taco and burrito joint with pretty good drinks as well. Guacamole was great but more so all the taco choices were very tasty. Stopped in for lunch and was in and out in about 30 minutes. Would recommend and will be back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"This place got it right!!! Great patio! Kitchy, cool, great dining room! Great bar! Food is consistant, tasty, well presented and fairly priced! Beer is fresh and cold! Margaritas are excellent, not gooey syrup, fresh lime! The patio, bar, restaurant AND restroom where clean!! Imagine that? It can be done! :-) 

Happy Hour is fantastic and what a great deal!! But even without HH prices, it is well worth what you get!

My first visit was 8 days ago on a 'Two Dollar Taco Monday'. 6 days later on Sunday, my friend and I were craving it again. The next day/Monday when another friend needed dinner, I said - Hey, it's Taco Monday, you've got to try this place. 3 times in 8 days with different people, ordering various items and drinks. Everything, EVERYTHING was A+ all 3 times!

To top it off, of the approximately5-6 employees that we interacted with, every single one of them was helpful, caring, friendly, clean and efficient! 

Keep up the great work!! Especially LOVE the patio!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this restaurant and always recommended it to anyone looking for something different than the typical Mexican food. Unfortunately my friends and I had an awful experience the other night because with incredibly rude servers and the bartender, Rebecca. Not only did she act like it was the biggest inconvenience when we asked if we could do separate checks, she didn't check on us once to see if we needed anything nor asked how the drinks or food was. Her attitude and glares were uncomfortable the entire time we waited for our dinner. The food didn't take terribly long to come out after we ordered but when three of us never received our entrees and I asked if they were on their way our, she rudely told us that because we ordered on separate checks the food would come out at different times. The strange thing (and I pointed this out to her) was that the three missing entrees weren't ordered at the same time. Finally after about 20 min two more entrees came our. Everyone was waiting for all the food to arrive so their food was cold and once again, no comments from Rebecca nor the two male serves that the last one was coming. I've worked in many restaurants when I was in college and I've never not apologized for any delay in food coming out nor gave guests death stares because they inquired where some of the entrees were. Not treating people with respect and ignoring their questions is horrible service and uncalled for. After 25 minutes the last entree arrived and after a heated exchange with Rebecca and the two male serves she told us to get out and that she was the owner of Diego Pops. None of us have ever experience such horrible service from a formally good restaurant where we all have been to many times. I'll never go back and since the host says she has no idea how to contact Ryan the actual owner, I'm stuck writing this review instead of addressing the terrible experience with him. It's really a shame because the food is decent, great when it comes out fresh and hot, but I would never give a business who hires managers like her revenue. Worst dining experience we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos and Brussel sprout nachos are a MUST!!! I never would have though anyone in our family would be a fan of the Brussel sprout nachos but WOW are the delicious, I could literally eat those as my meal and get nothing else. They also have a pretty decent happy hour $5 margaritas and $4 beers. It's fun and trendy but on top of it all they actually have good food. I was really happy with this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here after seeing all the great reviews. It was a Wednesday night around 7:15 the wait was less than 5 minutes. The decor is cute but sitting inside gets very loud. We were greeted right away and told the server that it was our first time here. She suggested the Brussel sprout nachos, so we ordered those. While waiting for those to arrive we each ordered 2 tacos. Two shrimp, one pineapple pork and one steak. 
After 30 minutes we were still waiting for the nachos and had already asked the server what the hold up was. She blamed the kitchen yet we kept seeing others getting their food before us. She said she told her manager about the delay.
When they finally arrived they were good but nothing amazing as I was expecting from reviews I'd seen. 
The tacos arrived shortly after along with a bunch of sauces. I realized after taking a bite of the steak taco that the sauce is provided to add flavor to otherwise bland tacos. 
Once we finished we waited again for the server to realize we were done and bring the check. The table across from us was also having issues with getting their food. I'm not sure if it was the servers issue or the kitchen or a combination. Either way it was not a good experience the manager never came by and we won't be back. This seems to be a typical Old Town tourist restaurant."}
{"text":"Collin served my girlfriend and I here the other night and made our experience fantastic. He gave great recommendations was friendly, prompt, and very accommodating. This was our first time here. The vibe in the restaurant was very interesting and fun. The food was also very good. We had the queso dip to start, and we each got two tacos. We regularly go to another taco shack, but I'd say we've been converted. Next time we come with a group we'll have to try the ever so popular Brussel sprout nachos. Thanks again Collin!!"}
{"text":"Only giving 3 stars because the employees there are soooo rude! First there's the host who didn't even a knowledge us when we walked in and when she finally approached us it was with such attitude. The waitress was so short and no personality. We had the nachos and tacos + sangria and the food was delicious sucks for the costumer service because they ruined it for me"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good food, good vibes. Phoebe was a great server. Had crispy cod bowl with coconut rice. Yum! Especially topped with some of their signature sauces. Will definitely come back again if in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"This place for happy hour is magical. All the apps are half off and they have good drink specials.

What to order. Nachos. Seriously. The quesadillas both beef and chicken had a good amount of meat and Street corn queso. 

What to think twice on: the cerviche. It was more of a shrimp cucumber salad with a cream based sauce. 
White wine sangria. Tastes like orange juice."}
{"text":"Loved this place!
The service was excellent. 
The decor was funky and bright. 
The food was delicious and we were there for happy hour - so super affordable!"}
{"text":"{ Dessert Review Only } We originally wanted to come for drinks but got sidetracked by another place down the street. Out of what we ordered I preferred the churro sundae (churro fries, vanilla soft serve, and dulce de leche) over the Mexican coffee (coconut soft serve, cold brew coffee, shaved Mexican chocolate, and dulce de leche). The soft serve itself isn't as creamy and more icy than most. Diego Pops has cute decor of pineapple wallpaper and sayings along the walls. For example Que Pasa on the door to the kitchen and Hola Bonita in the ladies room. I'm on a mission to come back and try the drink in the coconut."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town with some girlfriends and stumbled on this place on our morning walk to coffee! We ending up having dinner there that night, the chips were light a airy, the service was amazing and if you are a sucker for nachos you MUST try the brussel sprout nachos! We will definitely be back on our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this trendy spot!! It's very cute with all the colorful decorations and has a beautiful shaded patio with misters to keep cool. The green chili chicken tacos were AMAZING! My girlfriend and I also ordered the street corn caso, which was also delicious! I recommend the watermelon snow cone margarita, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place based on the reviews, but it was just ok. We tried it out on a Sat eve around 6:30pm.  We were seated immediately and our waitress was super friendly, cute and very helpful. For apps, we ordered the Brussel Sprout nachos with beef (by far the best part of our meal), guac -which was fine, and the plantains, which our friend loved.  For our entrees we ordered the shrimp tacos.  The presentation was just lame. They were small and looked as though they were thrown on the plate with some misc broken chips on the side and not a ton of flavor. Unfortunately we've had better tacos at random taco stands in regards to flavor, size and price.  
Bottom line, if your meeting friends for drinks and just want some apps before heading somewhere else for dinner, this is a good option for fun atmosphere, good nachos, and friendly service.  But if your looking for amazing tacos or entrees, pass on Diego Pops. 
It was worth trying but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Jessica our bartender was so awesome!! Super knowledgable and fun to hang with during our spontaneous happy hour! Diego pops is a treat! The fried egg Brussel sprout nachos will change your life... And Don Julio on top is the icing on the (tequila) cake"}
{"text":"Great Sunday Funday! Happy hour all day. Half off all appetizers as well as drink specials. Food was very good! Awesome red sangria, chips were crispy, guacamole was seasoned well, coconut ceviche was refreshing, etc etc. I will be back here for sure! Delish!"}
{"text":"I typically don't do bad reviews but this place was disappointing. The chips and salsa were great but that was it. The chicken taco was flavorless and I never did taste any chicken there was so little meat. The shrimp tacos were fishy so i didn't finish them. The corn queso dip was blah and cold. And the prickly pear green tea was just a fancy name for plain old green tea."}
{"text":"Went here for cinco de mayo. Sat very quick for as busy as it was excellent service. Excellent food. Wonderful vibe. Will come back."}
{"text":"Subpar to mediocre at best. This is NOT authentic Mexican style food. Their menu caters to those who like Mexican food without the unhealthy aspects of Mexican food, which, let's be honest, makes Mexican food so delicious. You won't find red rice or refried beans here. Instead, you'll find healthier twists to classics which I'm not against at all. Unique renditions of popular dishes are refreshing when it's done right, unfortunately, Diego Pops was lacking in flavor. I ordered the cod and salmon tacos with beans and rice. The only thing I finished was the cod taco on a flour tortilla (it was actually pretty good). Everything else had minimal flavor. This place was not what I was expecting and I was truly unimpressed. The service and ambience are excellent, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The food was not good and the service was so bad. We had to send back a beer three times before he brought us an IPA. They also ran out of food but took 20 mins to let us know that."}
{"text":"Super cute patio!  Amazing food!  Yummy drink served in a coconut shell!  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place because of the patio !! 

The food is can be tasty depending on what you get . Stay away from Poke . Very little fish is served . I really like the guacamole but the chips need to improve ASAP ! Been stale all of my visits . ( it's not that hard to make tasty fresh tortilla chips!) 

The reason   for 3 stars is : Bar. I have had to correct my own margaritas . Either too much sweet or too much sour. The other cocktails are very weak . I had 4 specialty  drinks yesterday and did not even feel a little buzz lol. My two girlfriends said the same . Our tab was over $150 .. Should be able have a little fun from that ! NO. 
 
The experiences I have had with the bartenders is lame ! I really think they need to re think who they hire. Bar staff seems grumpy and annoyed if you sit there and very unexperienced. ( perhaps they recruited from a Olive Garden or Sizzler ?!) Highly suggest they get some bartenders who have been working high volume bars in the area. They will bring in a better vibe, higher clientele and most importantly better drinks ! 

I have heard this from quite a few people I know - word is on the street  : Pass."}
{"text":"I heard some amazing things about this place and finally got to check it out. My intention was to stop by for a quick drink on my way to dinner. But.... I was hooked after having the sangria. It was amazing! Then the bartender Ashlyn made another guest some kind of snow cone margarita. Wow, it was the coolest drink I've seen. I mentioned that and Ashlyn told me to try the guava coconut. Well, once again, I was amazed as it was mixed in a carved out coconut! The food is just as amazing  as the drinks. Try the braised green chili chicken tacos, you will not be disappointed! Have Ashlyn make you a drink and your night will be complete."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Scottsdale for vacation and wanted some quality tacos and margs so when we googled and found this little gem, we were sold! 

Pros: Excellent food and sauces.  Tacos are decent size for the cost, great flavors, and a basket of amazing house made sauces are at every table.  Loved the shrimp, green chili chicken, and salmon.  I highly recommend getting at least of the tacos in the flour tortilla as it's amazing and handmade.  Drinks are decent, but food is great.

Cons: Service was confusing and aloof.  I asked for a recommendation and I got a long, twisted response with no actual suggestion.  Also, the waiter forgot to put in our order for appetizer.  

Overall a place to try for sure!"}
{"text":"We came in for happy hour today (3-6pm) and appetizers were half off.  

We ordered the Brussels sprouts nachos with steak and street corn queso and both were so good. 

What I liked most about here is that they have a rack of different sauces and it's amazing -- I mixed the garlic beet crema, salsa verse and Serrano ranch and eat it with my chips or with my tacos! 

Love the vibe, the way it's decorated -- just everything about it makes me feel like I'm in Miami by the beach!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was great and the waitress did a great job serving us. I was disappointed in the food however. We started with the corn and it lacked any real flavor. I had the California burrito and again the flavor was really weak. My sister commented on the lack of any flavor on her black beans and I didn't get much in the way of flavor from the skirt steak or the pinto beans either. I had to add copious amounts of hot sauce just to get some flavor.  However, my sister did like her cod taco that was served Baja style I believe.  She did comment that her margarita was weak on the tequila. For a Mexican place I tend to think you should get the beans, flavor and tequila right. They definitely missed it on all three."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for so long and it was everything I could have imagined! 

First of all, the place itself is super hip. Neon lights on the wall, huge booths, nice bar, etc. It looks pretty small when you walk in but once you turn the corner there is a bunch more seating. 

To start, we ordered the chips and salsa which came in a huge pan. For dinner, I had the pineapple braised pork but I did it as bowl instead of a taco. It came with rice and pinto beans and it was AMAZING. The pork was so well done and mixed really well with the slaw and pineapple on top. 10/10 would for sure recommend. 

This place also has a great drink menu and happy hour. ALSO, I'll be sure to come back for taco Monday too-3 dollar tacos all day!"}
{"text":"Nachos are the best! Great environment and service also!"}
{"text":"Super fast service and everything was so good! The Mexican Street corn was the best I've ever had!  I had 2 tacos; shrimp& chicken with rice and beans. Everything was good. Only thing they should change is that the don't double up the corn tortillas, which they should so they don't fall apart."}
{"text":"I've tried. I really have. However, Diego Pops is too inconsistent for my liking. The food is fine but it's not worth the crapshoot that has become my every experience. Great service? Rare. OK service? Likely. Bad service? It's happened. When I want a quick lunch, quick being the operative word, I've learned to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stopped in during happy hour on a Monday. The place has a nice location with a beautiful patio.  There was a decent amount of people for being a Monday.  We had the ceviche, and I had the plantain bowl.  Between the rice, beans, onion, bell pepper, and corn, it created a nice combination of texture and flavors.  The staff was friendly and nice to look at, which always helps...This would be a great place to stop in for a few margaritas or tequila flights on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale at the aloft and found this place on yelp. We sat at the bar as it was going to be 30 minutes for a table. The bar was busy and they make a lot of custom margaritas, so the initial contact was a little slow. After a bit we settled with our own margaritas that were made with fresh juice and good tequila. We also had the Brussels sprouts nachos. You gotta get those. The fried egg on top - what doesn't have one these days - was actually a nice topping and did go with our margaritas. I also chose a bowl with fish, black beans and brown rice. Also good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the most traditional version of Mexican food, this won't be it. They definitely put a twist on their dishes- Brussel Sprout Nachos anyone? Some of the best guac and chips I've had in AZ though. I usually stop in here on my lunch breaks since its down the street from my job and Christian has been my server almost every single time I've gone in. The service is always consistent and he remembers our order every time :)"}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets. The shrimp taco is amazing. Size is perfect so you can have two or three tacos and share some guacamole.  There is a super nice girl that works there and she is great about letting you try some some samples of their Aqua Fresco until you find the one you like the best.  We love this place and haven't found a better place for taco's in Scottsdale yet. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I would give them 6 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot... I frequent it almost every week and sometimes multiple times in a week (don't judge me).

If it's your first time, you have to try the brussels sprout nachos.  If you don't like brussels sprouts... get them anyways.  The brussels sprouts are really buttery and compliment the cheese and egg.  It has some great flavors and textures... it's very unique to Diego Pops!

The cocktails are all pretty decent but if you're looking for a nonalcoholic beverage, I love the limeade aqua fresca.  It's really refreshing especially during the scorching hot summer days (and nights).

I usually either get the grilled shrimp tacos (delicious) or I go for the mango habanero wings.  The wings take a bit so definitely plan accordingly but I think that they're worth the extra time.  No matter what I'm eating, I always have the beet crema (the pink sauce) on hand.  I don't know exactly what's in it but if they sold it, I would buy gallons at a time.

The service is definitely spotty but that doesn't necessarily bother me because I really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning - here is a review from someone else who had a similar experience. \"Being that I wrote a very fair email regarding myself and 4 other people getting bad food poisoning at my birthday dinner on September 2 and never got a response is very disappointing....I love coming here and I just really wanted to bring it to their attention. 

Then I come on here to see if anyone else may have gotten sick and someone posted a review just 2 days after our experience stating they also got food poisoning.\""}
{"text":"Pregnant women beware. Want to know if the cheese is pasteurized? Well, it all depends on who you ask. The waitstaff doesn't have any clue and isn't quick to check with the chef. Last week I was told my dish was made with pasteurized cheese only to find out today that it isn't (or so they say). I hope the chef can educate their staff (and perhaps include details on menu) so that future moms don't have to worry about miscarrying secondary to listeria. Listeria is deadly but also preventable. Future parents have enough to worry about without having to deal with inaccurate information from ill informed waitstaff. Shameful."}
{"text":"Cute vibes, great casual place to catch up and socialize with friends. The brussel sprout nachos are my favorite. However, they could put some more toppings on!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of home (California) the drinks were strong and refreshing. I love the decor. The customer service is good here also. The only thing that I didn't like was the sauce choices they were too Americanized for my taste ........ and lacked flavor. Also they do not have tapitio lol which made me a little upset (personal preference)"}
{"text":"Service was fairly prompt and decent. Fish tacos and burrito were small, cold, and very little salsa included. Just not very good. The decor absolutely sucked and I don't really normally pay much attention to this. A tiny amount of chips from the bottom of the bag, crumbs and all, were dropped on the side of my plate. The music may have been the worst thing. Some kind of terrible 90s techno music that sounded more appropriate for a car commercial. Way overpriced for what you get. Beer was served on the warmer side. We were there around 7pm on a Saturday. We ended up salvaging the crappy meal at a small but excellent street taco spot, for about 1/4 the price.p"}
{"text":"The Brussel sprout nachos were soo delicious. Definitely a must try. The guacamole was very fresh. Came during happy hour. $5 margaritas, wine, and sangria! Didn't get a chance to try the tacos, since sharing the nachos and guacamole was more than enough for my bf and I. Will have to come back next time I visit Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Always good service, amazing food and chill music. One of my favorite taco places- and that's saying a lot because I am a taco lover and I am constantly seeking out the best tacos in town. Also taco Monday's? Don't mind if I do! If you haven't tried this place-do. The bar is the best spot! Rebecca and Steven will take great care of you! Arizona is full of amazing food but friendly attentive customer service is hard to come by."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Scottsdale that has fried plantains on their menu. As a Colombian, that means the world to me. Whether you go on Mondays for cheaper tacos or any other night, the food is amazing and they also have a full bar. Steak tacos, fried plantains and a Dos XX is my go to every time. 
Parking is a little small so if you're planning on drinking, just Uber there so you don't have to worry about parking. If you do drive, there's a big parking stricture about 1-2 blocks away, so it's not too bad anyways."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I'd waste my time here. The food would have been ok, but the service was horrendous. I've never seen such laziness and idiocy in my life. 
By the time our food arrived, it was cold to the touch.  The place wasn't even busy!  How does that happen??
How bout a little teamwork people?!?!?!  Too many people standing around doing nothing. Take a little initiative and wake up!!

15 minutes later.....still waiting on our check. Unbelievable.......

Another 10 minutes.....check requested (again)....deer in the headlights look from the waitress.  Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time stopping in here while traveling to the area for work. Ambiance is amazing, colorful, and as a Chicagoan I love eating dinner outdoors in December :) 

Food wise you can't go wrong. The street corn queso is a must, the tacos are all excellent, the trail mix salad is also really really tasty. Oh and the drinks and sangria are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this place every time.  Servers are great. Food rocks.  The \"pink sauce\" is addictive."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Scottsdale for happy hour. The outdoor patio of Diego pops is awesome. Food is great ( get the nachos ), soup is awesome too- there is so much chicken. It's location is awesome and is a great spot for drinks. I am at Diego pops a few times a month for happy hour 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"I liked everything I ate here, and I'll definitely be back.  Service was great, and it's open late."}
{"text":"Yum! Came in for Taco Monday and they did not disappoint. I got the fried cod and a chicken tacos on corn tortillas with Rice and Beans of course!! I also got their happy hour margarita but didn't love it. 
Sitting outside was so fun and Claire was awesome. She was incredibly attentive and had great recommendations. Can't wait to try more of their happy hour tacos!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a great experience here, starting with our server Jessica. She was right on with her menu suggestions, very quick and attentive. Drinks and food were above average and we love the variety of sauces they bring out for you. Try the nachos with the Brussels Sprouts they are amazing."}
{"text":"Had a really solid meal here on Taco Monday. We had the Brussels sprout nachos which were very unique a tasty. We also had the pineapple braised pork, bbq chicken, and crispy cod tacos. All three were very good, especially for the two dollar price point. Service was great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were really surprised...this place was great! Food, drinks, and service were all outstanding. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Why is this place not busier? I feel like it might be the hidden gem of old town. Amazing food, great happy hour and unbeatable atmosphere with that patio. Everything on the menu is delicious and the staff is great. Always sit at the bar and all the bar tenders are great. Come 2 to 3 times a week and it isn't enough. Don't sleep on that beet crema either. Sounds weird but it is life changing."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and it turned out to be pretty good. The decor and atmosphere is very fun with a mid century vibe and large patio. My husband ordered 3 tacos; steak, shrimp & cod and I ordered the sweet corn and avocado Caesar salad with added braised green chili chicken, and we both had the prickly pear iced teas. Service was fast, brief but friendly and our iced teas were kept full. All three of my husband's tacos were delicious. It was fun trying all of the sauces/salsa options that they brought to the table, each one was better than the next. I especially enjoyed the garlic beet crema sauce which went great on the cod taco. The standout was the braised green chili chicken that I added to my salad. It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor, when I return I will definitely order this again."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, try the braised pineapple pork. Jessica is great! She's been our waitress twice now and we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by briefly for HH around 4:30 on Friday, and because we had a large party there was unfortunately no room outside and we were seated inside. I was not a fan of the atmosphere in there at that time, felt like being punished for the large party by being shoved in a dark corner. There was maybe only one or two other parties in there at that time, and it just wasn't \"fun\". (Note to self, ditch the friends next time. No true friend would come between you and tacos anyway). Otherwise the decor is cute! I have a mild obsession with pineapples so of course I immediately fell in love with the wallpaper.
Service/Food: One of our party knew the waiter, so we had good service. I only stayed long enough for chips and salsa and an order of the Brussel sprout nachos, which in my opinion were mediocre - I have no idea what everyone is raving about. 
Drinks: We were lucky enough to be greeted by a brand rep for Don Julio and we received two weak pitchers of margaritas for free. Beggars cant be choosers, right? So, I will not say anything more about how watered down they were and how she just gave us a stack of not-very-clean cups for us to pass around/pour ourselves. One of our party did order the sangria from the bar and it was awful. She finished it but said it tasted like soap?
Parking: even at 4:30 the parking lot was already packed and the valet was starting to block off opened spots. I had to circle around and park across the street behind the restaurant. Not a huge deal but a slight frustration. But I guess that's Old Town for you.
I would like to come back again, maybe sit outside, try more of the menu and drinks. I've heard really good things and had much higher hopes. It did seem to have potential, so I will chock this up to a one-off occurrence. Looking forward to being able to update my review next time."}
{"text":"I've hosted three large parties at Diego in the past few months (one as large as 35) and have been very pleased!! The service is prompt and attentive, food is exceptional, drinks are delicious and prices are spot on!! I'll definitely be back sooner than later! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Each taco is about $3.5-5.0. It was a good size, and we got two per person. If you are hungry, you can go with three tacos. We got pineapple pork, grilled shrimp, crispy cod, and chicken. Cabbage and pickled onion in the tacos were very fresh and crunch along with a good amount of meat. 

Salsa tasted phenomenal with a kick of jalapeño.

Ambience is cool and modern with a touch of retro. It feels cozy and welcome. The waitress was incredibly nice by pointing out highlights and explaining the menu in detail as we were first timers. 

We highly recommend this place and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"While in town on vacation, I walked here from my hotel on the search for awesome tacos, and Yelp didn't lie! I sat at the bar and met the bartender Jessica, who made me feel welcomed and was extremely nice. I ordered the cod taco and steak taco and oh man, I did the happy food dance while eating them...I was not disappointed! The watermelon mint margarita also put a smile on my face. The ambiance is open and welcoming with great upbeat music playing. Definitely would come here again!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good here. I suggest the Brussel sprout nachos! The service however wasn't that great.. The girls seemed too busy to host us or accommodate a larger party for a birthday. The queso dip was also very oily. Fun atmosphere and good happy hour!"}
{"text":"You have to try the brussel sprout nachos! Best nachos I have ever had. The steak and shrimp tacos are delicious too. The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a nice lunch with my daughter. Not sure what has happened with the service industry. In my option it sucks. You pay $50 for lunch and get shit service. I'm better off eating at home. The food was okay. My water, drinks, appetizer, entre show up at the same time. As everything  is being served at once my waiter spills my margarita on my pants and sandal. Says sorry, runs away never to be seen again. Luckily anther server was near by to get a napkin to wipe myself off. Seriously. I complained maybe thinking the manager would come by, but only to hear the server is busy. Never going back, that's for sure. If my waiter was so busy the manager should be helping making sure everything runs smoothly. I'm sure the manager was standing there with his thumb up his ass."}
{"text":"Stephen was one of the best waiters I've ever had. He dealt with such a large group so perfectly. He had great recommendations too! No one was ever without a drink. Best service ever. 

Now on to the food...so delicious! The house salad is a little sweet but they have an array of salsas to spice anything up! The beet crema salsa is out of this world good. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

I'm so happy I've found this place, it is one of the rare Mexican food joints that can be extremely healthy and is really conscious of different dietary restrictions. 

We both had two drinks each, appetizers, and entrees for about $50. That's a steal on date night  in old town if you ask me!

Not to mention the mango habanero margarita is one of THE BEST MARGARITAS IVE EVER HAD!!! I will 100% come back just for this. You know how most spicy margs are a little earthy? This wasn't like that at all! The chili rim had me licking my glass (no shame). 

Props to the decor as well!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming into this restaurant based on all the reviews on here but overall it was just okay. Diego Pops does have a very nice presentation going for it and I did like the decor. For lunch I decided on the cheese quesadilla and the shrimp taco. The cheese quesadilla was better than expected and I loved the presentation that it came in! As for the shrimp taco it was decent but nothing too special as far as tacos go.

Service was a bit of a letdown however as once the restaurant got more busy it took a while to finish up my meal and get the check. Perhaps they were short staffed or just wasn't expecting so many people to show up but it wasn't too big of a deal.

Overall I would say that Diego Pops is a nice addition to the area but with the service being a bit of a letdown due to the slowness that I experienced at the end of my meal I would probably think twice about coming back here again. Also with so many Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area there are definitely better options for food."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it here for lunch with the fam! I loved the laid back, colorful, and breezy atmosphere. It is a great place to come with groups.

To start, we ordered the much anticipated brussels sprout nachos. I've been seeing photos of them for days and was dying to try them. They definitely lived up to their hype and were DELICIOUS. I loved the garlic beet crema and of course the egg on top! The brussels had a great roasted flavor as well. We also ordered their guacamole which was fantastic, along with their homemade salsa (but watch out, garlic breath)! 

For my entree, I had the kale caesar salad with their green chile chicken on top and it was super filling + delish. The avocado was a great addition. My family members got tacos for their entrees and I must say, the 3 broken chips that came on the side were a little lame! My suggestion would be to give more chips or maybe a more appealing side all together since chips are complimentary at the start anyway. Everyone at the table commented on this! 

All in all, I really liked the vibe and eats so i'm sure we'll be back again with friends! I didn't try their margaritas since I was there for lunch but will most definitely try one another time! They looked pretty!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Taco Monday! This is one of the few Mexican restaurants that can do crunchy tacos so well. The Taco shell is crispy and never greasy. The ice cream is delicious and if you go to Diego pops it is a must have."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Had the poke (make your own) which was good. Shared a sampling of tacos with my husband including Pork, shrimp, fish, skirt steak and crispy machaca. Tacos and guacamole were the best! Especially the pork and beef machaca. Only complaint was the tacos were a smidge pricy. About $4 a piece."}
{"text":"I love love love Diego Pops!!

BONUS: Check in here on Yelp and get a special of $5 for a taco and a beer. YAY Yelp!

Appetizers:

*Chips & Corn Queso* A wonderful spin on my beloved queso. It's been a struggle for this Oklahoman girl to find some great Tex-Mex queso in Arizona, but my taste buds are settling for more authentic Mexican food. This corn queso is amazing! You get some corn, you get some cheese, it's amazing. Try it.

*Chips & Guacamole* A mild guacamole, delicious and they are generous with their portion

*Chips & Salsa*

*Shrimp Ceviche* This refreshing appetizer is served in a coconut! I What makes the ceviche refreshing is the cucumber. Beautiful display and delicious shrimp. The app is served with their house made chips.

Tacos:

*Grilled Shrimp* my favorite thing about these tacos is that Diego Pops keeps it simple. Not too much, but loads of flavor packed into the variety of sauces they serve with the tacos/dishes to give it that extra oomph. 

--You can also order the tacos in bowl forms- choose your protein, take out the tortilla, add rice, beans, and slaw.

Drinks:

You can't go wrong with tequila. I usually get the taco + beer for $5 or a margarita with my meal!

Great first, second, or 23rd date spot =)"}
{"text":"Came back to Diego Pops for happy hour. 
Great experience at the bar with Jessica the bartender. And the waitress Katelyn were great. Food is good as always. 
Keep it up."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and DELICIOUS tacos. They have tons of different salsas and sauces that elevate the tacos to a new level."}
{"text":"Love Diego Pops!!  The atmosphere, food and service were all fantastic! Our whole family enjoyed dinner here."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times before and have had no problems. Margaritas and food are cheap but this last time i went, it was such a terrible experience and i wont be going back. I was swatting gnats away the whole entire time, managed to kill 3 of them and capture photos of them. Mentioned it to our server and she didnt even care, not only that but she charged us for the regular priced margs instead of happy hour like we were supposed to receive. Super disappointed.  I wouldnt recommend coming here unless you want to feel like you are on a barn swatting the flies away from the cows."}
{"text":"Well this place got me to write my first review. With all the yelp reviews I figured it would be a good taco spot (and the 4-5 dollar price range per taco) so my wife and I decided to stop by. Usually a place that has that price range like Puesto in San Diego or several taco food trucks in LA they have amazing tacos. Maybe it was a bad day but the steak and the chicken tacos I had were way over cooked and honestly only tasted like the sauce you chose to put on in. The add on for rice and beans were 2 dollars which got you a ketchup cup of each lol my wife's tacos were a little bit better though. The corn tortillas weren't the greatest either"}
{"text":"Such wonderful service and great people running this restaurant. The food IS AMAZING!!!!! So much flavor, unique vibe to each plate, really really good!!! Outdoor patio is very cool with the bar attached! Can't say enough positive things about Diego Pops!!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty cool and the food is good, but I can't say I crave any of it.  We have come several times, with friends and with our kids.  I have had the ceviche, it is different but good, the coconut gives it a twist, not sure if I am crazy about it, but it is edible.  The brussels sprouts nachos are good.  We have had several tacos and they are very good. We drank some different kinds of margaritas and they were good also.  My kids had sides of the braised green chili chicken and is pretty good.  The quesadilla was a little bland.
The kids had ice cream and it is cool to add the different toppings."}
{"text":"Good vibes, awesome food. Lively, good music and ambience. Quick service. We had a nice night out with some new friends. This was are first visit, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Recent visit for Taco Monday's where a selection of the tacos are offered at a discount from the standard menu pricing.   I had the skirt steak and pork taco which were both excellent and filling, these aren't the street size snack tacos, those two were enough to qualify as a light dinner, add a side of rice or an app/salad and you have a full meal."}
{"text":"Ugh. Really wanted to like this place. Service was below par to put it nicely. 15 min to get drinks on a quiet night is not acceptable.  Will not be returning for many reasons #1 bad service #2 food was mediocre at best. Had the chips & guac= meh. Poke tuna was unmemorable tacos I heard were meh but not worth heading back. Service was horrendous! Margarita was ew. Not much more to say."}
{"text":"Sat outside in the middle of the afternoon; couldn't even tell it was 107 degrees out. They have a cover & fans constantly going. The drinks were refreshing & the bartender, Ashlyn, was funny & provided AMAZING customer service."}
{"text":"SO SO GOOD! My best friend and I have been here a couple times and both times have been great! The first time was in October and we sat out on the patio (since the weather was great in AZ, haha) and watched some baseball on the TVs. It was busy, although not too busy. We both had tacos, and let me tell you they were DELICIOUS! The second time was on Cinco de Mayo and it was PACKED! The tacos were still the best part. It was so crowded that we were placed in a tight spot around other large parties. We could barely hear each other and the pitcher margarita LITERALLY tasted like lemonade!!!! WHAT! When a pitcher is about $20 and it is Cinco de Mayo...please actually put some tequila in there. Disappointed about the margs and is why I didn't give a full 5 stars. We will definitely go back though :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Ashlyn always takes great care of everyone! Food is amazing, drinks are great. Patio is so comfy."}
{"text":"Ugh, instagram did me wrong. This place gets 10/10 for being 'grammable but otherwise underwhelmed me. Tacos, guacs and margarita were all just okay."}
{"text":"Been to Diego Pops a handful of times when it first opened, always had a great experience. Loved the food and the decor. But like every other place in Old Town the quality of the food and service falls off. Our waitress got every single one of our orders wrong, forget two of our orders, the sangria was bland and warm, we had charged skirt steak bowl and plate, both weren't really edible. The meat was overcooked and dry, the brown rice was burnt and hard. Our other friend ordered the green chili chicken plate, he barely had two bites. The tuna poke was lacking tuna, think about a bowl of poorly prepared stale coconut rice and some greens, with the tuna playing hide and seek. The waitress told us they only had hot sauce available, which is false having dined there before I knew for a fact there is a bunch of homemade sauces, but towards the end of our meal she showed up with all the sauces. An overall terrible experience for all of for of us and a waste of $150. Maybe the waitresses should write down orders so they don't have to be reminded everyone is missing something and from the taste of the food they either need a new chef or someone who can cook for humans because my dogs wouldn't eat what was served to us. Thank god for AMEX, a simple call to them will make this dining experience disappear cost wise. Taco Bell is a 5 star restaurant versus this place, service and food quality wise."}
{"text":"Alright. I know it's Sunday, but how patient do I need to be? If you're looking to hang out, this is your spot. But if you're an impatient type or have places to be, this is not for you. We waited SO long for drinks and food. Too long. The food and drinks are phenomenal but my god, I had to really shut my mouth and try and be calm - everything took forrrreevvvveerrrrrr to be served. I would go back for the food, but not my first choice. Way too slow of service. Kitchen, waitresses, and bar - all of those need some sense of urgency. I even heard another couple say, \"well, at least the food is worth the wait\" - extremely slow for a reputable old town restaurant"}
{"text":"This is my GO TO place. Fun atmosphere, great food & drinks. Such a unique menu I get something new every time. Ask for Michael & Steve at the bar they're the best!! #MondayTacoNight  If you're new get the nachos or pineapple pork tacos."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the service, but the food was really good. My husband and I came in after the dinner rush and although there were several tables open, were told there was a 15 min wait - for inside and out. Finally the bartender told us we could sit outside first come first serve. After watching several employees walk by, clearly seeing us sitting there, a server asks us if we would like to order. Ordered chips and salsa because we were starving and watched the table next to us get theirs... Ours came out with the meal. The food was very good, I had the California and my husband had the house burrito. Waited another 15 min for our check after we were done eating. I won't go out of my way to come back here... Disappointing because the food was good."}
{"text":"Great service, super fresh food and
Fabulous value for money.

Craving tacos we thought we'd give this restaurant a try. 

Started off with chips, salsa and guacamole and I must say i was super impressed by it all. The plantain chips in particular were a big hit.

The tacos were good especially given the price point. The salad was incredibly fresh (rare to find) and tasty.

Left feeling very satisfied without breaking the bank.

Atmosphere was cool and the service was amazing. They are super friendly and eager to please!

While it wasn't the best tacos or Mexican I've had, the price point and service made up the 5th star"}
{"text":"When it comes to Mexican food I can be somewhat of a brat after having spent 10 years in the desert, close to the border. It's hard when you walk into Mexican restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale because immediately you think you're going to get some \"touristy\" food and experience. Let's just say I was somewhat surprised when Diego Pops exceeded my expectations. 

The actual \"space\"of the place is amazing. A huge patio with plenty of Arizona sun, and a bar stocked full of great tequila. Well done. Our server was a super nice guy (probably an ASU student), and gave us great recommendations on the tacos. I ended up ordering the braised chicken, steak and pork (one of each) and I was very impressed. The best part...the tortilla. It was a flour tortilla done proper, so big ups. 

The check in offer was a taco and a beer for $5, so I naturally ordered that and tacked on the other two tacos. What a great deal, so don't skip on the check in. The others I dined with that day said the salad was a little bland but, fine none the less. Moral of the story, get the tacos."}
{"text":"Good food but nothing special. Our waiter, Levi, was very good. They had a check-in special that was a beer and a taco for $5 . I had that plus a steak quesadilla. Affordable meal, decent food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend dragged me into this joint because she always wants to keep up with the Old Town restaurant scene, however I'm glad she did.  

I recommend the Brussel Sprout Nachos, Poke Bowls are refreshing and delightful, and Margarita's are superb.  Add the pink beet sauce to any food you order because it is hella fire!  Will definitely be making many trips back."}
{"text":"The only redeemable thing about this place was the good food. However, our server never returned after Taking our order. We were never given napkins or silverware. We asked for napkins from a busser & 15 min later still didn't have any. I had to get up to get them from the back myself. Never got a refill on drinks or got check. We were done for 20 min and no one approached us. Started getting harassed by a drunk group by fire pit over taking our extra chair we were using for our purses. Kept arguing about how a persons isnt sitting there. We gave in & moved our things. This group was falling out of their chairs and burning MENUS yet the business kept serving them MORE alcohol. Finally threatened to throw them out if they burned another menu. Which they did. But restaurant didn't cut them off or throw them out. Just came back & scolded them. Finally got fed up with waiting & getting harassed so I got up to ask for the check. I was so pissed we spoke to a manager about our server disappearing and the obviously drunk group outside. Manager apologized once and that was it. Didn't invite us back or wish us a good night. Poor customer service from top down. I guess if you're not an obnoxious drunkard, you won't enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Terrible, this place is a joke the service is terrible the food is not fresh.. The food takes forever, they brought out our entree first and our appetizers last and we had to wait for our drinks for 20 mins.. If this tell the owners anything, I hope it's helps and is taken only constructively!"}
{"text":"We went to Diego Pops for dinner on Sunday night. The vibe is young and fun, the decor is a little retro, and they played great music all night.

The food was good and not heavy. We ordered the brussels sprout nachos and chicken enchiladas to start and then I ordered the fish taco bowl with quinoa. The bowl is big and after the apps and few margaritas, I could barely make a dent in the bowl. I think the classic taco is the better way to go unless you're starving.

Food and drinks were great, price was right, and loved the outdoor ambiance. Will definitely come back on my next trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"I checked into Diego's on yelp and got a beer & taco for $5! Can't go wrong with that, I got a Adobe BBQ Chicken Taco, I like the texture of the flour taco shell it's a lighter flaky texture I've never had before.
Bartender made a good Michelada I get those whenever I see them on a menu, in Brooklyn we call them bloody beers I'm always making bartenders make me those here.
The Brussels Sprout Nachos were fun same flaky texture to their chips, it's a nice atmosphere outside at the bar area, kind of trendy area of Scottsdale I won't be back but it was still good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!!  I like the decor, there's a large patio space and there is plenty of room inside that kinda reminds me of a standard Mexican restaurant but with splotches of chic vintage decor.

Happy hour deal is awesome.  Taco Mondays are awesome.  The pricing is not even close to greedy which is rare in Old Town.

The food is good too!  We tried just about one of every taco and the only one I was a little disappointed by was the skirt steak one - needs more flavor.  BUT this can be easily remedied by a large array of sauces/salsas that come to the table with your food!  We also tried the fish taco which was excellent.  The braised pork and chicken ones are solid.  

Its so refreshing to find an establishment in Old Town that's just so good all around!  Great food, great service, AND great pricing??  This is one of my favorite spots already!"}
{"text":"I always go back to this place and always take friends and dates here! So consistent with their food. Beef machaca tacos and chicken green chili are bomb! They will also recommend a soft or crunchy shell depending on which one you order. 

Drink wise: margarita one with muddled jalapeños was fantastic. Also the coconut guava drink comes in a coconut! So delicious. 

Ask for Anthony the waiter. He's so sweet and charming, I asked my date if we could take him with us lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Servers remember you! Always smiling. Perfect happy hour. The habanero mango wings yuuumm."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner. It was packed! Looked like the place to be. 

SERVICE - The hostess was nice. Waiter was decent! 

FOOD
Brussel Sprout Nachos - Nachos w Brussels sprinkled on them. The pink beet cream was pretty good with it. Solid dish but I thought there would be more sprouts. 

Grilled Shrimp Taco - Everyone raved about this so we had to try it. It was good but nothing spectacular. The corn salsa was good though. Probably best thing about the taco. 

Plantain Taco - This was interesting. It wasn't bad, just different. Interesting flavors because the banana was sweet but then it sits on creamy beans. Not quite sure how I feel about it. 

Coconut Rice - I really had high hopes for this but it wasn't that good. Didn't taste much like coconut and it was super mushy. 

This spot is more so for the cool vibes and the social aspect. As for the food, I would choose to go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience. Overpriced non authentic Mexican food. Forgot our appetizer brought it after the meal was over."}
{"text":"Ugh!  Cool vibe, interesting menu, good drinks...but the worst service.   Per usual, we sat the bar.  It took the bartenders a good bit of time to acknowledge us, but when they finally did we ordered two cocktails (Mexican mule and the watermelon mint margarita) - both were good.   There were quite a few interesting drink choices so I was already looking forward to trying another!   We started with the brussels sprout nachos. However, when they arrived - neither bartender stopped over to give us plates, napkins, silverware or just to say hey, all okay.  We had to wave down the bar-back to give us plates but still no silverware.  When the bartender finally came over, we asked for it.  No apologies for the wait.  We finally had all we needed to enjoy; albeit a tad cold, they were really good and we just about ate entire thing.  As it turns out, that was a good thing.  We were never asked if we wanted another drink or more food. We were so turned off, that we flagged down a bartender for the check. Had our one drink, one appetizer and bounced.   

I think they know they have a cool thing going, and people will come anyway.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Good service. Good tacos. Danny and Fox were prompt and attentive. Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for outdoor dining! The design is very playful and colorful both indoors and out, but they nailed it on the patio. 

This is a perfect spot to take that person that says \"but I don't like spicy\" when you suggest Mexican food. It's also a fresh, healthier menu than traditional places offer. Their dishes (especially the bowls) can sometimes err if the bland side, but they do give you a basket of sauces you can add to your taste, and their salsa is delicious. You can order their tacos in a bowl over rice or quinoa, but most would agree that it's overly filling in that format, especially because the fun part is sharing smaller plates here!

All the apps are delicious, and they have a great selection of specialty margaritas as well as some simpler, classic ones. 

I knocked off a star for service, because it's pretty hit or miss. Their have been times that I've chosen elsewhere because I didn't want to deal with a snotty waitress based on past experiences, and then times when I've been pleasantly surprised. But I'll say there is enough other stuff to like about this place to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want to sit with a large group (8+) they sit you separately and do not accommodate adding one seat to keep a full party together. Dinner is awkward and it might be \"policy\" to prevent parties from sitting together but it only leaves a bad taste in patrons mouths. We waited over 30 minutes for a party of 9 when a party of 8 sat down immediately. If you want to come with friends just stick to the bar because you will have mediocre service and will not be able to enjoy yourself at dinner with your friends because you are literally a table away."}
{"text":"OMG! These tacos are the epitome: Food is Love! Such flavor in every bite only comes from a labour of love. We ordered different dishes and everyone in our party was ecstatic with the quality of their meal. 

We. Will. Happily. Return...again and again!"}
{"text":"Good food but consistently poor service. Always understaffed and staff apathetic.  Loco Patron not as fancy but really good food and much better experience overall."}
{"text":"Great staff, always friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. A go-to spot for tacos and nachos in old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Went here for a pre-artwalk drink at the beginning of July. We sat at the bar. I should have been uncomfortable, but was not. The misters were working great. We only had drinks and chips so I can't comment on the food, but the service was very good. Everyone working that night seemed to be having a good time and we did too. See you soon, Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"Wow had a fun time at the coolest spot in Old Town ... Diego Pops ! ALEC was a great server with a fun and attentive personality. He made our dining experience the best .The food was yummy,drinks cold  and perfect.Cozy atmosphere and the manager was so friendly and obviously loves what he does running the place . Jd was his name ...cant forget his contagious smile... we will definitly be back and spread the word how cool this place is ."}
{"text":"{**Hey There**}

I met up with my hubs and another couple here on a random Sunday afternoon...around 3 or 4. Considering this place is off of a busy road I was surprised it wasn't busier! 

We decided to sit at the bar (the best seat in the house) and our bartender was quick to greet us. She was extremely personable with us and the other bar patrons and you could tell the staff had a good rapport with each other. Lots of smiles, laughs, banter and productive all at the same time. **kudos guys**

Alright, so I ordered the guava coconut cocktail and wow. Wow wow wow. It's all things coconut and fresh and scrumptious and refreshing all at the same time! My party were lame and two of them ordered Coronas the entire time but again the waitress was spot on and kept them coming.

We shared an order of guacamole and salsa and all I can say is **Y U M** the food that they kept bringing out for everyone else smelled delicious AND looked amazing. 

I can say that I will be back to try more of the liquid menu but also the food. Updates to be expected in the future.

*cheers*"}
{"text":"Went to this location with my husband. It's cute and not formal, very casual. 
The service was good and we ordered tacos. The salsa was good but not spicy at all. It was fresh and we'll seasoned. It didn't stand out but was not bad either. We ordered asada tacos and they were ok too.not bad at all but didn't stand out either. I felt for the price they could have been a little more than the basic expected taco. Again, it wasn't bad, just didn't stand out. It's close to everything in Old town so it's a good location and convenient if you're doing other things."}
{"text":"We came in on Memorial Day and took advantage of the happy hour taco menu - the skirt steak and braised pork with pineapple tacos were super tasty and a decent size.  We started with the street corn queso and ate it all up...it was really good!  The patio is great and pretty large, the service was friendly and the food was good.  We had a few issues with our order, but they rebounded and made it right."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is good, the vibe is nice and it feels a little secluded from the rest of the places down Scottsdale road. I was really excited to try their snowball margarita, one because I love ice, but two it's like an ice cream drink. But I wasn't as thrilled when I had the drink. I was a little disappointed, but again because I'm an ice lover, so I thought the ice was too hard for me to actually take bites and enjoy. Other then that, the place is clean, the people are nice, and the food is good."}
{"text":"I recently went back to Diego pops and have to say that the food, service, and menu were excellent. All their tacos are amazing, but I loved the al pastor."}
{"text":"Last night was my fourth visit to Diego Pops.  We just love the place.  The decor is so cool, the food is delicious and somewhat different than most Mexican restraints, and the service is outstanding.  Give it a try, I think you will agree!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, great outdoor seating, lousy service and bad food. The fish tacos were ok, the skirt steak tacos were like eating roast beef, the Poke bowl was flavorless."}
{"text":"Four stars for the ambience and cebiche. A fun lively place in Scottsdale. Their Sun happy hour is a pleasant surprise! Beware: their happy hour tacos are deep fried not soft tacos. So order accordingly. We had their cebiche, guacamole, and two tacos: beef and plantain. Both pretty good, not mind bogglingly so. Nice place to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband, brother-in-law and sister-in-law for our first night out after having our twins!! We had been here once before and I had been craving the amazing Brussels sprouts nachos.  Steven was a great server and made a ton of awesome recommendations.  We followed nearly every one, including three desserts that were by far the most amazing thing this mama has had in a long time.  The Braised Pineapple pork and Green Chili Chicken tacos were also on point! We will be back again very soon - and I will most definitely be asking to end the evening with a Campfire!  Thanks for an awesome evening out!!"}
{"text":"Visited Diego Pops for the first time yesterday for dinner. The weather is getting nicer after the sun goes down and we thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the patio getting to enjoy it...and our margaritas.

Our server Taylor was fun and really helped us navigate our way through the menu. She recommended items and they did not disappoint. My husband is pretty picky about what he likes and everything he ordered was brought to him just as he specified. The pitcher of margaritas our server convinced us to get may have helped his mood though! Delicious! Lol

We will be back for sure - relaxed, casual, great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"We had an assortment of tacos and the chips and guacamole. Each taco was better than the last! They had plantain chips mixed in, which were delicious. We also loved the atmosphere.

We had the pineapple pork, the skirt steak, the adobo BBQ chicken, and chile verde baked chicken."}
{"text":"Here is all you need to know; GREAT food, subpar-terrible service. We sat for almost over 15 minutes before someone even came to us. During that time servers walked past us multiple times. Ambiance is okay. Good place to catch up with friends but don't put much stock in the waiters."}
{"text":"Ashlyn is a great server. The food is life changing from the guac to the margs. You won't regret eating here."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour food and drinks.  The Tortilla Soup was awesome.   Had two rounds of drinks - great service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in past 2 weeks.  Food is good, probably 4 stars.  But service is VERY slow, 1 star.  I probably won't go back as a result of very slow service.  Diego Pops, you HAVE to hire better and more servers or you will not last.  There is way too much competition in Old Town -- restaurants with adequate and much faster staff.  Simple."}
{"text":"This review is for their Taco Monday. You heard me not Taco Tuesday; it's Taco Monday, where all of their tacos are $3 each. Normally Diego Pops's tacos are $3.50 to $5.50. Even though I was super excited for tacos, I had to get their famous Brussels Sprout Nachos and Mango Habanero Wings.

I really enjoyed the addition of the brussel sprouts to the nachos but they seems like an afterthought, just added to make different from regular nachos. Still, the combination of the queso, fried egg, corn, pickled onions, and garlic beet crema was delicious. The wings were also a tasty appetizer with medium heat level. Now onto the main attraction, the tacos.

I ordered the Grilled Adobo Chicken, Braised Pineapple Pork, Charred Skirt Steak, Grilled Salmon, Crispy Cod all on flour tortilla. At Diego Pops you have a choice of flour or corn tortilla for all tacos or what is recommended. It was the general concensus at our table at the chicken was too dry and the salmon too fishy. The favorites were the cod, steak, and pork in that order. 

Service was slow, with us asking the waiters multiple times for the same item. But everyone was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back again for Taco Monday.

What I recommend:
-- Brussels Sprout Nachos
-- Crispy Cod taco
-- Charred Skirt Steak taco
-- Braised Pineapple Pork taco"}
{"text":"Have darn good margaritas! The chips are really yummy and their house salsa is recommended! Tacos have unique flavors and different styles than your normal median place. I would definitely recommend it as a casual place to grab food and enjoy conversation. Definitely check the outside area!"}
{"text":"I wish I could take their sauces with me everywhere.  We originally were planning to go to a different restaurant nearby, but so glad we ended up here instead.

We came in around 11:30 on a Saturday, and were seated right away on the awesome patio. The decorations throughout the restaurant are so unique and really give a cool vibe to the place. (I think I need an awesome colored retro fridge!) 

Our waiter came out quickly and introduced himself. He was fun, friendly and helpful. They have a great mix of spirits, margs and other drinks. My friend ordered her go-to: the Watermelon Margarita. I had a sip and it was delicious and refreshing! I chose the Prickly Pear and so glad I did. The flavor was spot on and the bright pink color was awesome as well. Others ordered the regular margarita and a beer, both of which they were pleased with.  

The drinks were great, but the food was excellent! I had the steak and salmon tacos and tried almost every sauce they had. Absolutely delicious! The sauces added variety to the meal and made each bite tasty and unique. The chips and salsa they brought out were crunchy and fresh, respectively. 

We live in Denver, but I'm already excited to visit our friends again in Phoenix so I can continue exploring this menu and sip a margarita on the patio!"}
{"text":"This is the most terrible Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I mean how can you ruin Mexican?, it's Mexican. If I hate this restaurant so much then why did I rate it 2 stars? Well first of all, they gave us food so that is a 1 star,  then they have a decorated restaurant so there goes 1 more. It wasn't bad experience though it was just bad food. It had music it had people just not enough staff. Now let's talk about the food. First things first. The appetizer which was chips and salsa. Can't go wrong with that right? Well this is what I learned, you can go wrong with that. Salsa was bland and chips had no flavor whatsoever. Then the food , only thing that my family liked about that was the cholula. Terrible. No flavor. I recommend that you do not go to this restaurant if you don't like things with no flavor!"}
{"text":"Diego Pops looks like it was designed to be instagrammed, so I didn't necessarily have high expectations for what the food would taste like but was pleasantly surprised. A coworker and I are in town for business and stopped in on a Monday night, and it was surprisingly pretty busy around 6:30pm but we were able to be seated right away. 

We started with some guacamole and chips that came out immediately, but it was just slightly bitter and was browning in parts, so they obviously weren't using fresh avocados. I had 1 pineapple pulled pork taco on a corn tortilla and 1 crispy cod taco on a flour tortilla, and both were super flavorful with fresh toppings. The sauce caddy they put on the table really makes the experience though, you get 6 squeeze bottles to choose from with inventive flavors like serrano ranch, chipotle aoli, habanero oil, garlic beet crema, and 2 others. The beet sauce on the cod taco is next level. 

We also split the sweet corn and avocado salad with caesar dressing and adobe chicken that was pretty large and one person easily could have had as a filling entree. For 2 ppl our bill was $55 including 2 margaritas, so the food was a fantastic deal, but the service left a bit to be desired. It took awhile to get our server's attention and when I asked another for an extra bowl she looked at me and then walked away. Yikes."}
{"text":"I am so gravely disappointed with the customer service at Diego Pops. After making multiple attempts to book their patio in April for a wedding rehearsal dinner, I have been ignored. I have called for Corey, the head coordinator for booking for over 2 weeks now. I was given a quote of around $10,000 which I am more than willing to pay. When I called and spoke to Ericka last week, she promised me that Corey would call me that evening, after she told me that they had meetings over my event. 
So, Diego Pops- you have meetings about my potential booking but refuse to return my call? 
I am disappointed and so confused. Boo on you, Diego Pops."}
{"text":"This is top notch Mexican through and through. If you're in Scottsdale and craving Mexican this is your spot. The homemade sauces are unreal!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing... I've always passed by and wanted to try and I'm glad I did. Everything is made from scratch even down to the drinks. The tacos are delicious and Rebecca, Brittany and staff are very personable. I am definitely going back and bringing more guests with me so they can have the Diego Pops experience!! Dot forget happy hour 3-6 Mon-Fri and all day Sunday!!"}
{"text":"I love Diego Pops! I went there yesterday for lunch with friends. I probably go here at least once or twice a month.

We ordered the Brussels Sprouts nachos to start and we each ordered several tacos. The nachos are amazing and probably the most unique nachos I've ever had. There's delicious cheese, pickled veggies, Brussels sprouts (obviously), and even a fried egg! 

We each ordered a chicken taco, a beef, and a plantain. All three were delicious, but the plantain is my favorite. I also really like to get the plantain taco bowl!  

My friends also like to order their Sonoran hotdog. I've never had it, but it looks delicious and I want to try it. 

Be sure to order a margarita while you're there! They have an amazing happy hour"}
{"text":"Best cocktails in Phoenix! I had the coconut drink + tacos. The taco were just okay. Amazing atmosphere and the corn queso was to die for!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a Monday around 5:30p. I train service dogs and I checked reviews on Yelp prior to going in and noticed that they were very ANTI-SERVICE ANIMAL. Unfortunately, I found this to be true. When I arrived, I went to the hostess stand and immediately the hostess told me \"Uhhh there's no dogs allowed here.\" I got no welcome or smile when I arrived. I kindly told her that the dog was a service animal and again I got the \"uhhhhhhhhh we don't allow dogs.\" My dog was wearing a vest that clearly said SERVICE DOG on one side & IN TRAINING on the other. The bartender stepped in and told her service animals are OK. I was sat on the patio. I ordered a drink, chips and guac and sat for about 20min until the manager came out and told me that I had to leave because the dog was in training. DO NOT COME HERE WITH A SERVICE ANIMAL! I'm so sad that we got kicked out?!?!?! I loved my server and the bartender was so friendly but they are not service dog friendly. Obviously, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts didn't do it for me on the nachos. I thought the house salsa (very good and spicy) was better than the other sauces - but you have to ask for it. The steak taco was very good."}
{"text":"Went here twice in 2 days during a business visit.  Excellent attentive service, nice updated atmosphere - but most important - excellent food.  All 3 of us dining for lunch one day and dinner the next - felt that our meals were perfect.  The taco menu is extensive and well designed with something for everyone.  I would eat here almost daily if my office were nearby!"}
{"text":"What a great new spot! Cool modern taco shop & bar in old town. Very nice atmosphere for a quiet dinner or later on for some fun shots on tap and light eats. Cory and his team do an amazing job and truly bring home customized customer experience. I would recommend you check out this new hot spot ."}
{"text":"...that feeling when you arrive several minutes before happy hour ends and you tell the hostess and the waitress you'd like to get some happy hour before it's over. But they take their time, go do something else, insist on telling you all about the menu after you said you'd first like to get a happy hour margarita and then finally you say \"Can you make sure to get our order in while its still happy hour?\" and as she asks to see the time on your phone it clicks from 5:59 to 6:00 and she says instantly says \"Sorry, too late\"  and you say \"Seriously?\" And she says \"Sorry, no. It's over\" 
I pointed out that we were there with plenty of time, had told her, and the hostess, we wanted happy hour and that it turned to 6:00 while she looked at my phone.  
\"You can come back another time\" was her response. 

Yeah, that feeling. 

From now on : Loco Patron or El Hefe. Because, Diego, \"Sorry, it's over\".

UPDATE:
This has been lowered to one star.  \"Meta\" asked me to contact them, I took the time to write an email with more detail and \"Meta\" couldn't be bothered to acknowledge or reply. 
As they say, \"a fish rots from the head\"."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful.  I drive from Tucson to enjoy their food.  I have a friend who owns a business behind Diego Pops.  Each time we go, the staff is professional and friendly.  i think the owner spoke to us, but he did not act like he was the owner.  The place is just cool and a can't miss if you want great food served by nice people."}
{"text":"Pineapple Braised Pork is one of my favorite tacos in the city! The place has a real hacienda feel, as it was a pottery shop before, so its design and layout are as simple as they get. Great selection of food, great quality and their Taco Mondays are a nice relief if you're looking to get your taco fix early on in the week. Salsa selection is good, with a little bit of everything and I'm curious to have their tuna poke bowls!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 5 and a baby we came in and they gave us a table inside , after 5 mins we want to move outside just more ppl ( always seat outside in this place )
In 2 mins they found us a place ( the host lady wasn't super nice but she still helped) 
Skyler was our server - SHE WAS THE BEST , hard to find good smily service and she definitely have it all 
She mention that she work there only 3 days , but even then she knew all the menu and recommended the best food 
The atmosphere is great the drinks and the food are great 
For some reason they don't have TACO TUESDAY ONLY MONDAY TACO ( and that's really bad ) . Stop think money owner, think about the costumers ( you can celebrate sinco de mayo 2 weeks before , and you can't have taco Tuesday on Monday bc it's your slow day ) 
I will come back there bc of the atmosphere but not bc of the \" taco Tuesday \""}
{"text":"Loved the food and drinks were super good! The only thing is that it was overly busy and the service could've been a little better."}
{"text":"Been here a few times but in this visit I must say the combination of food and service was great. 

I came here with two friends for lunch, our server was Claire and she was great. I ordered the California Burrito which was unlike any California Burrito I've ever eaten and in a good way. The burrito isn't huge and isn't small, really it's not even medium. I wanted more, hell I wanted another burrito it was so good. I would describe Diego Pops as a taco shop if you only described a taco shop menu to Michelin rated chefs. It's elevated but also good. 

My meal was $10 and it was worth it. Love the combo of good food, great location and awesome service."}
{"text":"The service is excellent. The food is horrible. The  habenero wings were the worst wings I ever had. The pork taco was full of fat.  The drinks were good."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Was disappointed we wanted to sit outside but it was chilly. We asked about the heat lamps but the staff gave us the excuse that not of them were working? We thought it was a bit of a lazy excuse. The guacamole has little flavor and the quesadillas were completely plain with no dipping sauce. We didn't realize there are canisters of salsa you can get until half way through our meal and had to ask for a set of them. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks and service! Was in the mood to try something new and my roommate suggested this. The tortilla soup is amazing. They have great deals. Salmon taco was my favorite."}
{"text":"Cool little place with great ambiance and even better food.  You have to try the nachos!  $5 at happy hour and it's full size.  

Everything on the menu is awesome.  This is my second visit - in 3 days. Was here over the weekend and they were packed on Saturday night - we still got seated quickly and Cory the owner came and chatted with us.

Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"New kids on the block in Scottsdale.....great tacos and atmosphere. Can't miss the bright pink neon sign outside. Brussels sprout nachos looked amazing....if you're into that sort of thing! A great place for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"\"SAY YES TO TACOS!\" 

Hmm, I hadn't thought of it like that before... but as I make a point of always listening to demands made by illuminated changeable letter signs (like the one in the front of Diego Pops, ushering me toward a life of complete taco acceptance,) I decided this lunch time would be taco time!

Our group ordered a bunch of apples and then flew solo for the Entrees. The appy that stuck out most to me - The Brussels Sprout Nachos!

Did your inner child just twinge at that thought of putting Brussels sprouts on nachos? You should have! You should have just experiences a quick flash back to the overly steamed, and just downright terrible Brussels sprouts mom would either force feed you, or use to hold our dessert ransom until we had finished them. And now, you're telling me this Dr. Doom and Bane (big green guy from Batman)'s love child is coming after nachos, the most delicious food you can think of off the top of your head?! Not on this yelper's plate!

You can take a breath, Inner Child, because these nachos are the bomb! The thing is, you mom made brussels sprouts wrong. Sorry Mom... You don't steam them for days, you cut them in half then flash fry them in a super hot pan so you burn their little faces off. Then you put them on nachos and they're the best thing in the world! 

The only thing that could possible top them is the pink (aioli?) sauce they serve with it. It's coloured pink with beets, but its tastes like a mashup of garlic, creamy egg somthin-or-other, and love. I want to put this on everything now and do shots of it at parties.

The tacos - yeah, they were pretty good. Sorta like street side tacos, except fancied up in some form or another. Fancier, but not necessarily better.

All in all, it's a funky little place with delicious Mexican influenced dishes and I'd be happy to check them out again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this place twice already. We've tried the bowls and the tacos.  Nothing has disappointed. The service is pretty great and the ambience is fun.  The tacos are decent sized and jam packed with flavor. I thought the adobo chicken bowl was awesome.  Seriously awesome. My only criticism was that it wasn't spicy enough. But you can change that by getting their salsa. I had it with chips. It had nice heat and was super chunky. I could definitely make this a regular place to go."}
{"text":"It's was very good. Great energy and fun on the patio.  Loved the bowl I had and it was a fun twist on an ordinary Mexican restaurant. I'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. Our waitress Britney, with knuckle tattoos was so utterly rude to our table is was disgusting. From laughing in a girls face to talking back and bitchy looks, she was horrific. On top of that the manager would not serve a 23 year-old at our table with a license, and three other forms of id. She had made note multiple times that she had the right not to serve her and would not be. After embarrassment and disgust we decided to leave and grab dinner somewhere else. So disappointed in the experience they so rudely provided."}
{"text":"Walking in this place, I was in love with their decor from the neon signs to the pineapple wall. It is a bit more upscale than I expected. I sat outside at the bar. The menu is innovative with brussel sprouts nachos, which had two kinds of cheeses. The nachos had tortilla chips as well but I went back and forth between those and the brussel sprouts for good measure (and health)! They also had a list of amazing tacos, which you can get with handmade flour or corn tortillas. 

I liked this place, but honestly, it's the only place (restaurant, bar, brewery) I went to on my weeklong trip to Arizona where I didn't talk to a single person. The people who come here reminded me of the Orange County (California) bunch at home."}
{"text":"We had a large party that showed up unexpectedly.  Not only did they put tables together for us, they completely catered to our needs. 
Jessica is THE GREATEST WAITRESS I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She had another large table but eloquently bounced between the two."}
{"text":"This place does not need a long paragraph about my experience. Let's just say it's amazing and I bring all of my friends here! I could eat here everyday if it was possible. In my opinion, everyone must try the coconut drink! :)"}
{"text":"Trendy and cute! A Arizona twist to Tacos and food. Not your typical bar. More of a modern feel with a cool atmosphere. Had a tasty girls happy hour. We all kind of order different things on the menu. The venue has indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the cool spring breeze. Our drinks and food were served in a timely manner. Overall we were all pretty happy."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night and we had to wait 45 minutes for a table so we got drinks at the bar. The guava coconut drink was delicious and came in an actual coconut. It was pretty large and worth the $13. We also tried the Sangria pitcher which was good but not a huge pitcher for $32. I ordered the playa poke bowl which again was tasty but It did not have a lot of tuna or avocado in it. They used a lot of jicama as a filler. My boyfriend got the Sonoran hot dog and 2 tacos (shrimp & steak) a la cart which he really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and we'll be coming back. It has a cool indoor and outdoor ambiance and the food was really good. I love their different tacos and the ability to mix up your toppings. 

Like previous posts, if you're looking for \"authentic Mexican\" with enchiladas and fajitas, then this might not be your place, but the food and drinks are great if you're open for new options."}
{"text":"Chips, Salsa and Guac were all awesome. The crispy cod taco was great and the plantain taco's were pretty good. My only complaint was the sweet corn + avocado ceasar was weak on toppings - only trace amounts of corn and cotija, no croutons to be found and barely any dressing. I would also like more agua fresca options (beside hibiscus) and more non ice cream desserts.  I'll be back to try the nachos and a different salad."}
{"text":"My first time experience here was excellent! The tacos were very good. I loved all the different options and I cant wait to come back and try more!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was served timely and was very tasteful.  A great atmosphere.  And my two daughters thought our waiter was super hot."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place so much so that we went for dinner and then went back for lunch!  The atmosphere is fun and the space is beautiful!  Everything we ate and drank was fresh and delicious.  Of course the brussel sprout nachos are a must!  We had a party of 5 and tried tacos, bowls and burritos and everyone loved their dishes.  For lunch, my daughter and I went back for the salmon bowls after hiking Pinnacle Peak.  Service both trips was super friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to go back when we visit Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"Bristle sprout nachos and the Guava Coconut  great place for ambiance, as a graphics girl I adore the menu and how it is displayed. Love the elements they use in there, such as the license plates etc."}
{"text":"Great lunch and happy hour spot! We went with a group of 12 from work. Service was very fast, especially for a large group. I had the steak plate, very good. I love all the different sauces. I love the treat bar! I got the fruity pebble crispy treat!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour to get some drinks and appetizers and I was impressed with this place. I found this place by searching on Yelp and came here as a starting point for my visit in old town Scottsdale. This place has good reviews so I had to check it out.

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by Rebecca who ended up being the bartender. She was friendly and gave some good food recommendations. I ended up ordering the Coconut Lemongrass Ceviche and Mango Habanero Wings. The ceviche was a bit different from the traditional ceviche I have tried but it was good to try something different. I still liked it for the taste and fresh flavor. The mango habanero wings were spicy and it was a lot better with the habanero sauce that came on the side. 

There was also a Yelp check in special where you can order a beer and a taco for $5! You definitely can't beat that! The braised pineapple pork taco was very delicious and you must try it!

I would definitely come back here to try the other foods. Rebecca was awesome and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, good food and decent prices. Terrific spot to spend and afternoon!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight at Thrillist...the tacos were fabulous! I cannot wait to go to actual restaurant! By far the best food I tasted tonight!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food and have been to Diego Pops on multiple occasions, but today I experienced something so rude and disrespectful I don't know if I'll go back. I Have a service dog, and have had my dog on your patio many times before- but today when the hostess sat me- I was quickly and very rudely scolded by a young female manager that dogs were not allowed- I simply told her she is actually a service dog, and when I did so, I was asked so show proof- never in my life have I had to show proof of her being a service dog. I was so offended I wanted to leave. I don't know if the young women with dark hair was someone new or she just lacks manners-
But I don't think I'll be back at diego pops even tho the food is good- it isn't worth the disrespect."}
{"text":"I've been following this little taco shop on Instagram and couldn't believe how yummy the food looked, let alone the drinks!  My hubby and I ventured out and tried it yesterday.  We had the Mexican corn dip, cod taco, shrimp taco, and the skirt steak taco.  It was all absolutely amazing!  We will absolutely be frequent visitors!  Our waitress, Taylor, was a rockstar!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was awesome. I will definitely be back! Oh, and I recommend the shrimp tacos! Yummmmm."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time we have come to Diego pops and this place has never disappointed! We love the shrimp, cod and skirt steak tacos! They are always consistent and fresh. The new manager Justin was so friendly and informative on the tequlias they offered and anything else we asked him. The atmosphere is fun but chill. If you like tacos definitely try this place out! One of our favorites on the Scottsdale strip! :)"}
{"text":"The set up is nice. The service is slow. We ordered Drinks and received them when we were almost finished with our food. The hostess came across upset when I asked her if the misters were on outside. Overall not a pleasant experience. The food was ok I had high expectations for this place, was disappointed. Save your money."}
{"text":"Such an awesome local spot.  Great food, amazing prices, and the manager is super friendly.  The brussel sprout nachos are to die for.  Funky fun place to get some great healthier Mexican choices."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  great patio, loved the mist from the ceiling,  good service, but guacamole was too hard for dipping chips and it had chunks of pineapple which I didn't expect or liked,  their side dish of rice was so tasteless that I had to send it back, I'll keep going back hoping that they'll improve their food. No problems with parking around 2pm lunch."}
{"text":"I have always loved Diego Pops. How can you you beat a coconut filled with delicious cocktails? But today Trevor made it an amazing experience by being the perfect bartender. Thank you, Trevor, for continuing to make sure our needs were met and also let us do our thing. Perfect balance. :) best time at Diego pops because if tevor today. :) Keep hiring people like this."}
{"text":"It was good, but we liked Joyride Tacos better. We didn't even finish the salmon taco. It just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I'm planning to come back again tomorrow! Everything I tried was delicious. They have about 6 different sauces you can add to your tacos, but the tacos are so flavorful that I didn't need any sauces. I think the steak taco is the best. It was tender and they put avocado in it. Yum! The green chili chicken and adobo chicken were also wonderful. I asked the very friendly bartender if I should get corn or flour tortillas, and she suggested the flour. I'm so glad I listened. They were the best flour tortillas I've had. Chips and salsa were amazing too! I can't wait to come back here and try their other stuff."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in a week and was hoping for a better experience my second time around. They just recently opened and still have kinks to work out, but I totally get this. My first visit I had the watermelon Margarita and it was way too sweet. We had the Brussel sprout nachos and they were good, probably the best item I have had on the menu. My second visit I shared the Tulum Poke on coconut rice. I was disappointed because I love poke. The fact that they have 3 different options for poke they just pour the sauce on top of the poke instead of it being marinated in the sauce. It was lack luster in taste and small portion of Tuna on a heaping mound of rice. We had the street corn dip which was good but not hot enough in temperature.  I had the chicken green chile taco and shrimp taco. I felt that everything is just under seasoned and I am not a huge salt fan. The plethora of sauces help liven up the tacos. I had the coconut margarita, it came in a cool mini coconut, but I feel the coconut water does not go well with the margarita mix. The atmosphere is adorable and I really want to like this place. I will come back in a couple of months to see if they have worked the kinks out. I really hope so!!"}
{"text":"I never know what is going to happen. Sometimes its great, sometimes its not. I think its more dependent on the company I bring. Their service is not great. The food is not great. The atmosphere is AMAZING and the margaritas are great too! Wonderful social spot but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. The food was good, but didn't exceed expectations. Taste of the food was good, salsa was overly spiced, and service was slow. To be honest, I'm not sure I'd come back... not because it was that bad, but because there are much better Mexican joints nearby that I prefer."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and do think the food was pretty good. Service on the other hand is something to be desired. I usually don't complain or leave bad reviews but in this case it needs to be done. I came there a few months ago to meet my friends for lunch I had my dog with me. I was told that it wasn't a dog friendly place. Usually I wouldn't care and go somewhere else and not pull the service dog card. In this instance I was meeting people there that drove from north Scottsdale specifically to enjoy your tacos. I told the bartender that my dog was a service dog and that I was fine just being on the patio. At this point he said he needs to see paperwork. Strike one. Illegal. I told him that it's illegal to ask but luckily I did have all her papers in an email. It took me some time to find it since she has been certified for a few years now. At this point my friends showed up and we are standing around waiting on me. Finally I get them her papers. Bartender says he can't let us in !!!seriosuly?! We talk to a female manager that was the rudest person I have ever had a displeasure of meeting. She said I had to be blind or deaf and that's the only way they would let us in
!!! How illegal is that? Learn the law. After wasting our time making me look for the papers then insulting me we still didn't get seated. We ended up going to farm and craft and talked to the people there who told us the owner of diego pops was a dog guy and they were very surprised by the way we were treated!!! I should sue the place and turn it into a pet store that serves tacos for the dogs! Teach your staff the law when it comes to people with disabilities!!! https://www.ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.htmhttps://www.ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.htm"}
{"text":"Meh. They were out of most dishes (on a Saturday night) that were interesting, even some of the drinks we ordered were unavailable."}
{"text":"25 minutes for chips and salsa to be delivered then had to notify the bartender (not a crowded bar) of how long it took? Had to request the happy hour pricing be applied to our check? 25 minutes for ceviche?  Another 15 minutes for street tacos?  Zero apologies. The place is about half full.... 
This isn't my first visit to this establishment and I'm disappointed with this visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Great tacos & drinks. The brussels sprout nachos are hands down my favorite! I also love all of the sauces that they give you :)"}
{"text":"Didn't eat here but the  guava coconut drink is amazing.  It comes in an actual coconut and you can scrape it off the sides. If your coconut is on the small size they give you the rest in a side cart!"}
{"text":"Yes!! This place is everything a restaurant in Scottsdale should be. I loved the indoor/outdoor space with a great bar and decor. I ordered and devoured the green chili chicken quesadilla with garlic beet Crema drizzled on top. Pair that with a margarita and you're golden! I opted for the prickly pear margarita because...when in Arizona.. I will say it wasn't the best margarita I've ever had but it was tasty.  My husband loved his plantain bowl! It's so great that you can choose between crispy or soft tacos or a bowl as well as all the sauce options brought to your table. Can't go wrong at Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that the food was so good that I  couldn't stop eating...

Great food, super friendly server (Brittany), and awesome ambiance. I got a BBQ Chicken taco (spicy!), Braised Green Chili Chicken taco and a braised pineapple pork taco. All were amazing and the home made salsa was over the top! The GM stopped by who also could not be any more friendly. 

After stuffing my face full I couldn't say no to dessert... \"camp fire sundae\" changed my life... Ice cream, chocolate sauce, graham cracker and toasted marshmallow cream over top... they literally toast it with a torch!! Highly recommend. 

Hands down my new taco Tuesday (and everyday) Mexican food spot."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to a neighborhood in need of better taco offerings.  Will carve out a nice niche, better than America's but not quite as pricey and crowded as Barrio Queen.  The salsa bar makes and highlights the best chips in the area, best experienced as part of the Brussels Sprout Nachos."}
{"text":"Great tacos. I liked the plan again one the best. Chips were a little thin, but the nachos and Brussel sprouts were legit."}
{"text":"What a great spot for lunch or dinner. If you can snag a table or bar seat on their delightful patio, you'd be an idiot not to!

Let's chat about their homemade sauces and hot sauces. Great variety and great flavor. Let's chat about their spicy guacamole and freshly fried tortilla chips. Each bite had a little kick to it making it totally unboring.

However, my caesar salad was boring, not gonna lie. The grilled shrimps were tasty, but overall the salad was huge in size, but not on flavor. I definitely added a ton of hot sauce and the garlic crema to add a bit of a kick.

My friend's tacos were touted as big, but they ended up not being huge. She's also a veggie and probably ordered wrong. And when I say probably, I mean she did. I'd also suggest ordering the flour vs corn tortillas as they looked absolutely authentically, hand made.

The brussels nachos were delicious but not what one expects. Their nachos are just your regular nachos with some brussels involved, not brussels sprouts covered in nacho cheese and the works, which is what I really wanted and so does everyone else in the entire world. 

Service was wonderful. The cocktails looked wonderful. All in all, a huge win."}
{"text":"I was torn between and three and a four here. There is a lot of possibility to be a five and the ideas and execution are so close. They've been around for a bit and most of my inner circle come here every now and then. This was my first visit and prob not my last. I can say with a little focus on the small details in sure people would come back more often.

Positives:
They have one of the best menus for a Latin inspired menu, both drink and food. There are abundant options for vegetarians and the omnivores. 

Mexican Mule: perfectly balanced and jam packed with flavor.
Watermelon Mint Marg: I thought the lime was a bit strong but a very refreshing summer cocktail.
***Brussels Sprout Nachos: this is such a winning dish.  Everything about this dish is gold. It needed a tad bit of self seasoning as only the chips had salt, but once we set it up we were all about it. Must Try!***
Sonoran Hot Dog: the brioche bun makes this dish.  I could passed on the bacon as always because I can really stand bacon. But the hot dog was perfectly cooked and had such good flavor with the cheese and beans and everything!

Negatives:
Watermelon lime sno-cone: a couple steps annoyed me about this guy. They advertise it on their marquee. It actually drew me in and got me so fired up. It was the first thing I ordered when I sat down. It took a bit of time to make it because they hadn't shaved any ice, prob because they were slow and didn't want to have it melt yada yada. Then once it came it was kinda lame. Hard to drink/eat and stained my face red lol. I also hated he paper straw as it would get clogged with watermelon. It's cute but needs more fine tuning for execution.

Ambiance: many old town restaurants bank on location for success and let their eyes drop from the details. Tvs off while being open, tile floors that haven't been power washed in way too long. The floors are not originally black. And walls that are originally white just covered in scuffs and wear and tear. Look at website pics it's beautiful. If they put a tad bit of cleaning into the patio details this place will remain a gem."}
{"text":"It is very nice. It has great food. Tacos are small. So if hunger 2 or 3 is best. The bowel are great. People are great that work there. It's in old town in scottsdale,az. Happy hour starts at 3pm."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere overall. It's definitely more of a hangout with friends have a couple drinks kind of place. I had the braised green chile chicken quesadilla which was a must. Chips and salsa were fantastic. Wasn't a fan of the pineapple pork taco though. Not a lot of flavor. Pretty decent little place."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero but that's not possible. Literally looking at 5 open tables right now and told it's an hour and a half wait. We're the only people waiting. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great Tacos and beer selection. The carne asada was my favorite, the tortilla soup was delicious! Wonderful ambience as well, with the patio seating and music. Nice lively and casual place for dinner, just the way I like it!! We'll be back"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this restaurant a better review. I give this place a five for the ambiance and the beautiful plating. The food scores a three for me. However, the service gets a one for me.  

I went during happy hour. Happy Hour is everyday from 3pm-6pm. 1/2 of appetizers, $3 beers, $4 margaritas, $5 wine and sangria. Let me just warn all though...apparently their quesadilla appetizer is not included in the 1/2 off. No where does it say this. And trust me, the wait staff doesn't care. 

To be honest, it took the wait staff 10 minutes to even acknowledge me at the table. They all seemed very uninterested in being warm, friendly, or in assisting customers period. Then it took them another 10 to get me a weak margarita. The food was all beautifully plated, the restaurant was quaint, and the food mediocre. Favorite dish was the Brussels Sprout Nachos.

All and all, cute place. Hopefully they can step up their service, until then, there are much better places to go."}
{"text":"It was a togo order for me. They took a while to help me. Actually they took a while to even say hello. Once they did help me, everything was great!  I want to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Diego pops. We went in for a late lunch and waited at the front door for a few minutes before being meet with someone who got us a table. It was busy. It seemed like there was no host and maybe they were short staffed. And then it took a while longer for the waitress to come over. The cool thing is that was the end of the problem. Our server was awesome. She was helpful even being busy. Being our first time she was helpful in explaining the menu and helping us select the right thing. Generally I'm a traditionalist when it come to Mexican food. This is not your typical Mexican place. I ordered shrimp taco. Chicken taco and a plantain taco. Even though the menu said recommended with corn she agreed with me that flour was a better option so I went with crunchy with the chicken like the menu suggested. It was awesome. As someone who loves salsa they brought out a basket of six toppings all cold and fresh. When the food came out it was cooked perfectly including the plantains. My significant other got a pork bowl with coconut rice that rocked my world too. I'm glad that it was large so she didn't finish letting me sample that as well. She loves pork with sweet flavor and this didn't disappoint the pineapple was a nice touch. It was Tuesday and generally I love my taco Tuesday but not here it's taco Monday. How cool is that now Monday can become the best day of the week with Diego's three dollar specials. It's a hip place but without the attitude. It's kind of like what burger rehab is to the cheese burger these guys are to the taco. One of my new favorite places. I highly recommend it and can't wait to give the. Another try to see if they can live up to my first experience. Hats off to the cooks who made a perfect meal. My one complaint is the Coke beverages seemed a little flat which is surprising from a place that appears to pay attention to the details."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and I absolutely loved this place! Food was great but service was even better!! My server was Collin and he was such a sweetheart!! The atmosphere is also so fun and I love the aesthetic, I will definitely be coming back. Got the cheese quesadilla with corn LOVED IT."}
{"text":"Had the plantain and green chili - both are award winning from somewhere. The plantain was desserty and delicious.  I am not sure about the green chili though. I thought that it was good. But, award winning?  Hmmm.   I would try it again and order brussel sprout nachos."}
{"text":"The bar tender Jessica is amazing, make sure you come to her section. This restaurant is absolutely amazing!! The music is great and the atmosphere is so inviting. Come check it out!!"}
{"text":"Omg i love the brussel sprouts nachos so excited everytime we talk about this place even happier when i am there soooo bomb dot come"}
{"text":"Every time I have come to Diego Pops it's been an amazing experience. Anthony was our server this time and he was awesome. He talked to us, made sure our food tasted good, kept our drinks refilled and made us smile a lot. Not to mention, the food is some of the best food I've ever had. Definitely worth checking out!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Still one of my fave places to hit anytime I'm bouncing around OT.  My gfs order the brussel sprout nachos pretty much every time we go (even though no one eats the egg...) and I have fallen in lust with the plantain taco!  Om nom nom ... Still a great house margarita, a good and spicy salsa, yummy guac and thick chips!"}
{"text":"Great food, and great service from Anthony, the tequila selection was great and I would recommend the michelada bomber"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and the food and experience has been stellar. I came here last Sunday 6/10/18 and it was awful. Our waitress Michaela was nice and everything started off good. She recommends the elote off the cob and we were excited to try it. She said everything is the same it's just in a bowl. Well it comes and it is pretty much corn from a can not roasted nothing, it was disgusting. We don't complain we just kniw next time not to order it again. So I order my 2 tacos and wanted to try the coconut rice and pinto beans. My food comes and I can already see my crunchy shells are pretty dark which I over look. Being excited to try the rice I dig in... The rice is cold! Mind you Im at lunch from work so no time to send things back. I push it and the beans to the side cause I'm not eating cold rice and warm beans. I eat my tacos you can taste They are burnt... Still ate them. After I ate I went to go wash my hands. When the waitress comes to the table my friend says the sides are cold. Then the waitress picks up the sides and says rudely the beans are not cold, my friend says ok maybe not the beans but the rice is cold. The waitress then said oh yeah it comes cold...Who serves cold rice?? Ewwww!! My friend said well the rice was cold we weren't advised it's cold(not on the menu) she didn't touch the sides. In my opinion the waitress could of handled it different. She could have said I'm sorry about the rice it is served cold we can remove it from the order. She removed the $2 charge but how she was rude about it was annoying. Again normally it's pretty awesome but this past Sunday was terrible."}
{"text":"We went here during happy hour.  Appetizers are 50% off.

We tried their queso.  1.5 stars.  Had to return it.

chips and salsa.  3 stars.

ceviche. tastes fresh but has a sweet coconut taste to it which makes it weird 3.5 stars.

tacos: the shredded beef and pork tacos were amazing!! we both give it 5-stars.

tacos: the shrimp and skirt steak tacos we gave 4-stars.  they were good.

fried plantains were good too."}
{"text":"This place is fun, tasty, and comfortable.  It has a great tequila selection and a decor of bright colors and shiek 70s-ish style that will pop better and better as your eyes and brain adjust to the effects of their delicious drinks and shots of tequila.  

Make sure to dig into their unique appetizers to help you \"wash\" down your delicious custom drinks.  To accompany your third drink go ahead and indulge in a couple of their unique custom high brow tacos.  Plus the delicious food will help cut the alcohol so the fantastic decor does not get too blurry.  

Stop in for happy hour and get your night started right."}
{"text":"Iv been here a couple of times and everytime we go we fall more and more in love with this restaurant! Great food, awesome atmosphere, GREATMargartias (highly reccomend the pitcher)! Everytime we sit at the bar we get fast and excellent service! This one bartender named Jessica Skinner is AMAZING! She will treat you with outstanding service and makes some mean drinks! Highly reccomend this restaurant for great food and drinks or even a big group event!!"}
{"text":"What can I say...I'm so disappointed in myself for waiting so long to try Diego Pops! My girlfriend and I decided to try a place we both hadn't been to yet for lunch on a Friday afternoon. When I got there it wasn't crowded (as it was during the week) and so since it was so nice out we decided to sit at the bar on the patio side. We asked the bartender what was the best appetizer and she recommended the Brussels Sprout Nachos. DONE! I had the Guava Coconut cocktail (served in a baby coconut) and my girlfriend just had a margarita. The nachos came out and they were huge and AWESOME with flavor. You also get a mixture of sauces as well. The pink Garlic Roasted Beet Crema was OUTSTANDING!!! We were going to try the tacos but the nachos were filling enough we decided to stop there. 

Well, jump to the next day (Saturday) and while looking for a place for lunch I suggested Diego Pops to my boyfriend and our friend. After hearing about it from me the day before it was a DONE deal we were going back for lunch on Saturday!

We were served complimentary chips and salsa on this visit (why was this not consistent with all the staff...oh well). I decided to have tacos on this visit. I ordered the Braised Green Chili Chicken Taco with the suggested hard shell, Charred Skirt Steak taco with flour tortilla and a side of creamy beans. My boyfriend ordered the bean and cheese burrito (you get two in an order) and our friend ordered the Adobo BBQ Chicken Bowl. I started with my skirt steak taco and it was awesome. I then had my chicken taco and thought it fell a little flat on the flavor. I was disappointed but the skirt steak was great. The beans were also so good! My boyfriend loved his burritos and our friend loved his bowl! Again we LOVED the Garlic Beet Crema while our friend loved the Adobo sauce! 

We also ordered a few drinks: my boyfriend had the margarita, I had the prickly pear margarita and our friend had the Mexican mule. We all sampled each others and they were all very tasty! 

The Saturday we went the patio was full and so was the bar. The server we had on Sat seemed like he didn't really want to be there. He had a girl shadowing him for training and we saw her once time. 

I know we will certainly be back again very soon as i'm already craving those nachos!!"}
{"text":"This place is super fun and the food is delicious!! I love their green Chile tacos and street corn! Seating inside or out, both are great. The guacamole, chips, and banana chips are heavenly."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Brussel sprout nachos are legit even though they came out. Trendy decor and probably maybe better when it's not crazy for spring training."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Reason for 4 stars- we walked in and the hostess said \"sorry we are not taking any other parties for tables tonight\" I then said how we've been dying to try this place and may we sit at the bar, she was like sure... 
They were busy and I get it, however it was only 8pm on a Saturday evening. 

Other than that, the bar staff was fantastic- the drinks were unique and decently priced. Three words will change your life forever here- CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP. The taco was good but the soup WON! I definitely cannot wait to return (hopefully they will seat us next time :p)"}
{"text":"So cool, so funky, so good. Check out Taco Monday!!!! But check out theirs margaritas any day!"}
{"text":"was this the old ceramic place???? wow, what a change. 

the interior decor is super cute...almost like a 50's diner! they have a cozy, refreshing patio, which is where we parked for our meal. 

so we heard about these brussel sprout nachos? they are the bees knees! i kid you not, they are absolutely delicious. they are a great app for 4 people or a meal for 1. the cheese, brussel sprouts, and chili rings all go together with the delicious chips. 

i had the playa poke for my entree. the chipotle aioli was ok. i'd rather taste the fish than the sauce. next time i'd get something different. my dining companions loved their tacos, tataki and tulum poke. if you get the lettuce poke, be prepared for a hand-mess...it's hard to eat without a fork/spoon. 

i also ordered a side of fried plantains. sweet, crispy, and soft. cooked perfectly.

the one negative...the wife ordered a drink...it came in a coconut. basically it was 10 bucks for 2 sips. the inside of a coconut is small, and then they pack it with ice so essentially it was a bum deal. 

other than that, very cute and tasty place. the patio is NOT dog friendly we were told."}
{"text":"Super excited Diego Pops opened up in this awesome spot in Old Town. Went last night and enjoyed every minute of our experience. My girlfriend and I had a great server, wish I could remember his name, he was super friendly (but not overly annoying) and explained the entire menu and drinks to us!

First of all, the set up in here is perfect and so fun! The whole place is a 50ish diner theme with a twist (Mexican food) and the patio is great. Lots of space to sit and a great fireplace.

The food was great especially when you consider that they just opened - I'm sure they are still working out a lot of kinks. We started with the corn queso, awesome flavor, could have been much warmer but still good. I had the house salad that was topped with a ton of awesome veggies and had some sort of garlic vinaigrette that was delicious  - I chose the steak as the meat and definitely glad I did. It was cooked perfectly. My friend had the Poke and also liked her food a lot!! 

The alcohol selection is good- they make all their margaritas fresh and don't use any pre made mixes. They also have tequila flights, we opted out of this but I'm sure it's pretty legit if you are a tequila lover.
For dessert, they have an ice cream bar!!!!!! (Obviously I really liked this part- even though we didn't order anything). It was super adorable and you can just walk in and order at the ice cream bar if you don't want an entire meal. 

This place was great, we will definitely be back! Check it out- I really want Diego Pops to stick around :)"}
{"text":"Taylor made the best recommendations after hearing what I normally like (even making suggestions that weren't on the menu)! Delicious food with a fabulous patio dining experience."}
{"text":"Stop by after the Diamondbacks spring training game for drinks & fish tacos. The Hostess sat our party of 4 outside on the patio with Emily as our waitress. Emily was a gem and recommended the the shrimp & cod tacos. Great choice, they were extremely delicious and went well with our margaritas. Emily was exceptional pleasant and always made a point to check on our table no matter how she busy she got. My nephew was in the area and stop by for a drink and a quick bite to eat so we pulled up an unattended patio chair to our table. As we were relaxing and enjoying our conversation the hostess interrupted and pretty much scolded us that we are not allow to pull up an extra chair to our table and stormed away mad. We all could not believe what just happen. The hostess turn a pleasant 5 star dining experience to the worst by choosing to be rude, distasteful and ruining our Diego Pops restaurant experience. Sadly, my family & friends will not be returning as there are plenty of restaurants to choose from who will treat customers as 5 Stars. Why should I settle for less."}
{"text":"Prickly pear margaritas are really good with a great pour, you can even get a pitcher! Food is good and outdoor seating is outstanding. Definitely, a great destination while in Old Town."}
{"text":"great staff great food!  clean, affordable, atmosphere, parking...just amazing."}
{"text":"Really fun place with great tacos! The food and service were equally excellent. We sat inside, but the patio looked fun. The margaritas are excellent. We had crispy chicken and shrimp tacos. Both were fantastic. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Love this place."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty good. Drinks are really well done! Took my mom their for her birthday."}
{"text":"My favorite place for happy hour!!!  The brussel sprout nachos are THE BEST..and pretty much everything else on the menu.  I also love the margaritas served in coconuts!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool but it was the service and blandness of the food that won't get me to come back. Not to mention how overpriced their food was but that's what you get for non-authentic Mexican food. Another thing that made me not want to come back is I left my leftovers there and came back 2 seconds later and it was gone. It was a lot of food and I was very upset."}
{"text":"First time here.. Spectacular appetizers, drinks and atmosphere. We had a great time!! Happy hour was amazing deals, too!!"}
{"text":"So I went back to give them another try and I got something super simple like a chicken quesadilla. I really had hoped that it would be just chicken and cheese but NOPE. Again with them not disclosing everything on the dish. No where on the menu did it say that it would be topped with their garlic beet crema or whatever it was. I am very picky eater and the waitress was super rude when I told her I didn't want my quesadilla topped with whatever it was topped with. She kept pressuring me to try it and i DID not appreciate it. I just wanted her to please get me a new plate. She definitely gave me attitude. I will not be returning. That its twice that you have not disclosed everything in your dishes. You guys are very lucky I wasn't allergic to anything."}
{"text":"The house burrito here was amazing and the ambience of the restaurant was relaxed and welcoming. I used the Yelp check in offer and this place was great in honoring both from me and my friend. Would highly recommend the tacos and burritos here !"}
{"text":"Diego Pops continues to be my first stop for tacos in Scottsdale! Our server, Jessica, made great recommendations and made sure we had a good time. The food was awesome. We will definitely be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Have to change my review to 5 stars, was even better the second time. Only bad part is that parking lot!"}
{"text":"We came here for the weekend happy hour and ended up eating all the sides and got full. Need to come bk in the future to try other dishes. The nachos with the pink sauce - how can you resist when it looks so appealing and actually tastes so yum. My friend had the corns and they were awesome as well. And yeah the sides are pretty filling - need to save space for entrees next time!"}
{"text":"Menus have great choices. The pink beet sauce is heaven. Their tacos were good. Not your typical Mexican place. Their flavor a are unique and worth trying."}
{"text":"Love their California burrito and margaritas! Delicious food and friendly staff. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Awful service, wanted to charge me for the extra salsa which they didn't provide any with my meal. My friend got the poke and it was very small for the price. #notworthit  other than our immediate server(we sat at the bar) the others we unfriendly and ignored us when we first sat down even though they were not busy."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and the food was \"meh\" at best which is a bummer since I had been here before and the food was pretty good the last time. I got the Brussel Sprout nachos and the Brussel Sprouts weren't even cooked. It tasted as if they just threw them on the chips and that was that. Bleh. The server seemed more annoyed with us than anything and he was slow at just about everything from getting our drinks to even showing up at our table. I really was hoping for a great experience but when you bring six other people and everything is just ok, it's pretty disappointing. Their steak bowl was alright so I'd suggest to get that, if anything!"}
{"text":"We kinda found this place by accident but a great hotspot with Brussel sprouts nachos and delicious tacos. You must have the snow cone margarita! Yummy . Great Serice too the people are very friendly. Taylor our waitress was amazing!! Great attitude so nice and helpful! Service was great thanks Taylor!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Kelsey and Lorraine were great even though I'm a picky eater. The house marg was really strong too! I would def come here agan."}
{"text":"Great creative menu and dessert!  Had shrimp and skirt steak tacos and they were very flavorful.  Taylor was our waitress and was awesome in suggesting food items and making sure our Special order arrived as instructed.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place - the interior, the patio, the menu, and the food!  The queso corn dip, guacamole, and salsa were delish.  We had shrimp tacos, plantain tacos, and a crispy cod bowl.  YUMMY.  Plus they have really convenient parking out front."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Getting drinks was a 30 minute ordeal each round.  Apparently the bar was \"backed up\" yet they had four people back there and it wasn't even full.  We're just talking about pouring beer too.  Nothing even remotely challenging.  The appetizers came out well before our first round. 

Once we finally got going, the table was never pre-bussed and waters went unfilled.  The worst part is, the manager(s?) were running around and didn't check on us once or god forbid offer us an apology.  Either they are completely oblivious, lazy or just don't give a shit.

The Brussels sprout nachos were good.  The entrees were decent but cold.  

A complete disaster.  My prediction; gone within 6 months given such untrained, poor service."}
{"text":"Went to Diego Pop with two friends on a Sunday and had Jessica as a waitress.  She was super cool and very attentive to our table.  Her vibe was very chill, which is the way I feel every time I come to Diego Pop.  Brussel Sprout nachos for life!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this weekend before we visited the Grand Prix race nearby.  The service was not as good as usual and we weren't greeted by a hostess and waited a few minutes to be seated.  The friendly bartender noticed us and helped us out.

We dined on the patio because the weather was gorgeous.  We waited a while at our table before a server greeted us and by the time he did come (we'd probably waited about 10 minutes) we were ready to order and anxious for drinks.  Our service was definitely lacking and not what I've come to expect here.  Although they were very busy, which I'm sure affected the service.  We didn't receive drink refills very quickly and when we did they did not add more ice.  We felt a bit rushed, and had to ask for everything we needed (more napkins, more plates, more silverware, drink refills, explanation of the sauces, etc) but all in all had a decent experience.  The yummy food made up for the lack of quality care.

The Brussel sprout nachos were divine, the skirt steak taco was delicious and my husband enjoyed his machaca and shrimp tacos as well.  I love the chips and salsa here!  This was the best batch I've had.  I could drink that stuff.  The sauces are awesome and so fun."}
{"text":"I'm really happy that Diego Pops opened recently. I live in the area and have been looking for a Mexican restaurant that is nicer than fast food drive-thrus, but not as upscale as The Mission. Diego Pops is in a great location in Old Town and I'm really impressed with the way they've designed the restaurant. The decor is fresh and fun - everything is colorful and the place feels tropical. Parking out front is very limited, so save yourself the trouble of their tiny lot and go park behind the building. 

The food deserves five stars, without a doubt. I usually order two or three tacos depending how hungry I am, and whether or not we get guacamole. (Order the guac!) They serve you chips and salsa, which aren't terrible but nothing spectacular. I like that they give you a basket with a variety of sauces (chipotle, avocado puree, salsa verde, spicy red salsa, and others), but everytime I've gone the bottles have been low. How often are they refilled... and are the sauces fresh?

My favorite tacos are the steak, pineapple pork, and grilled shrimp. Go with the recommended tortilla on each one. Maybe order two pineapple pork tacos, because they really are delicious! Sometimes I'll get fried plantains as dessert. If you've never tried them, I would suggest ordering them next time you go!

The only downside to this restaurant is the service. I've been five or six times in the last few months and some days are worse than others. The staff is nice but not very attentive... sometimes I will literally have to flag someone down to get a water refill, a napkin, or even silverware! It's frustrating because all of those things are components of good, even mediocre, restaurant service. I hope the management decides to put more emphasis on good service - it's really the only thing lacking from a great restaurant."}
{"text":"So far we've been here for almost an hour & a half and it is taking forever just to get drinks and our food. Service is not great. 1st drink was too heavy on the syrup. Hopefully the food will be better whenever we finally get it."}
{"text":"I go here a bit as it's in walking distance of my home. I generally always do the same thing so I'm really on speaking towards that. I sit at the bar which is generally never full during the day. They have decent Mexican beers on tap so that keeps me happy - Dos Equis, Victoria, Pacifico, Modelo off the top of my head. I can't speak towards the cocktails. I'm not a big cocktail drinker, but I've heard their's are a bit underwhelming given the price. 

Food - I stick with the tacos. I get two and a side. Never disappointed and highly recommend any of them. Salmon may be my favorite. 

Also, it would be very remiss of you to not try their coconut soft serve. I get the tropical fruit one and add fruity pebbles. It's pretty damn delicious."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place have 4 stars. The food is not that good and service sucks. It's not that cheap either. Service is sooo slow. It took 15 mins for beer to arrive, same with the margaritas. It took them another 15 mins just to let my friend know that they were out of Sangria. The food was sitting underneath the heat lamps for a while."}
{"text":"As a 20 year resident of Scottsdale, I remember this location being a pottery shop for the longest time.

It's nice to see them redevelop the building into a cozy Mexican restaurant.  The patio and outside bar are good areas to enjoy a meal when the weather is nice.

The prices are reasonable and I enjoyed my skirt steak rice bowl with stewed beans.  The flavors and the different sauces that you can add make for a nice option without the heavy sauces and cheese that come on dishes at most Mexican restaurants.

Overall I enjoyed my experience here and plan to return."}
{"text":"Menu looks and sounds delicious but they came short after we ordered. Just stuck to appetizers that were ordered. Food is bland although it seems like a great place to come have a drink with a buddy."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great atmosphere. Went here for a friends birthday and got free shots!! Be sure to ask for Taylor. She has been our waitress twice and has been great. Brussel sprout nachos are a must have!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance with a Palm Springs vibe decor. I am giving it the 4 stars instead of 5 because of consistency and service. Sometimes the food is mediocre and often it's great, but the presentation, serving size and sides tend to be different each time I go. I don't like to be surprised by a dish I've ordered multiple times. The service could definitely be better . I think the last time I was there we had 3 different waiters. They often talk amongst themselves without paying attention to customers, which makes it difficult to catch their attention when you need something. Overall this  place is great and I'll continue to go back."}
{"text":"Thursday evening, service very sparse. Took 20 minutes just to take our order. Food came out okay or bad. Poke bowl had more apples than poke. Don't understand. I've cream machine broken. Didn't see our server for 20 + minutes."}
{"text":"Jessica is the greatest server ever! She was so nice and calm with our rather large group. I love this place and I'll come back soon!"}
{"text":"It's a fact, I am somehow cursed with horrible customer service everytime I try to branch out to new restaurants around the valley.  Diego pops looked like it had a great atmosphere and food when I bookmarked it on yelp. I've been trying to convince my husband to try it out with me,  and yesterday he finally agreed to go for my birthday dinner. What a mistake. 

We came for dinner around 7pm and were promptly greeted and sat on the patio.  The misters were really nice and kept the space cool. After sitting at the table for 5 minutes without being greeted by our server, I had a bad feeling that things were going to be like this for the rest of the dinner.

Once our server finally decided to show up, we ordered two margaritas (diego and prickly pear) and some waters. I was pretty thirsty so I sucked down my water pretty quickly. The first round of drinks took over 5 minutes but I was willing to let that slide. Once she delivered the drinks, we ordered chips w gauc and salsa, and I asked her for a water refill. The water never came. From the time she took our appetizer order, we didn't see her again for over 20 minutes. The bar was dead yet it took long periods of time to get simple drinks.  Our margaritas were not overly sweet (a good thing), but they were so watered down; either the bartender shook the crap out of them,  or they were sitting to be picked up for awhile.  Or honestly,  probably both.  Terrible pours on those margaritas.   The food runner brought out our appetizer and again, no water was brought to the table.  

Our margaritas and waters were both empty and we had finished our appetizer before we saw her again.  When she came back, we ordered some a la carte tacos and two casadores margaritas (I was hoping a slightly better tequila would equate to a better margarita,  wrong). The food took awhile but it was actually pretty good and the portions were larger than expected. I jokingly commented to my husband that we probably wouldn't see our waitress again until I was done with my meal...almost,  I was eating my last taco before she ever asked how our food was. 

A younger couple next to us was also irate with their service.  I tend to be lenient with servers because I work in the industry, but our server was not busy, just inept. The girl next to us was talking angrily and loudly about how they didn't have silverware or sauces for their food. The male got up and went inside in search of some service. That's pretty embarrassing for your establishment.  

There was another girl server on the patio that was really doing a good job, and I was very sad we got stuck with the crappy one we got. Received our bill for $72 bucks and left pretty pissed.

Pros-
Nice patio
Decent tacos (although the jalapeño on the bbq chicken taco was wayyyy too hot; and I enjoy spicy food)
Shrimp taco was awesome
Food runner seemed on point

Cons-
Possibly the worst server I've ever experienced
Expensive, watered down crap margaritas ($10 a piece)

What a waste of a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos and bowls.  Their bowls are like the fancy version of Chipotle bowls.  I really love their food and their location is great when you're boozing it up in Old Town.  Their parking situation leaves a bit to be desired and their wings can be awesome sometimes and then shockingly bland at other times.  If they could get their consistency up, they'd be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Has the best vibe, great fresh food with flavor and quick drinks! Love the atmosphere and the friendliness of the servers. In the perfect location to meet up with people all over the valley"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place is so cute! Perfect decor, cute bar, indoor/outdoor dining...all great!

I am super picky with my Mexican food, and in Providence where I call home we have really delicious spots.  The food here was good, it just didn't push into great for me.  I tried their burrito bowl, and my friends got the Brussels app which they said was awesome.  The drinks were good, and the wait staff were great."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few chances, but the service ALWAYS disappoints. 

However, I will admit they have a very cute decor and pretty (& delicious) nachos. But other than, everything is super bland."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my family for the first time for my 23rd birthday dinner! Had a blast! The environment was supper cool and laid back! Our service was outstanding and very friendly and our food was to die for and extremely fast! Over all this place is killer and now one of my fav restaurants to go too. Prices were also awesome! I definitely recommend the Brussel sprout nachos! I can't wait to go back and try something different! The server even gave me a huge rainbow rice Krispy treat for dessert because it was my birthday :)"}
{"text":"Good taco & ambience, but their service and chips were so terrible that I question ever coming back.

My fiancé and I were greeted by the hostess and were seated.  About five minutes later someone came by and asked if our server came by, we said no and ordered our drinks and chips & salsa.

We got our chips & salsa and about 40% of the chips were stale. They tasted like they were cheap restaurant-style chips (which are typically large), but we're obviously broken into smaller pieces. The salsa wasn't bad, but nothing to return for.

As we chomped on chips which many were just plain hard,  we wondered where our drinks were and we wished we had ordered waters to tide us over while we wait for our drinks.  Another waitress came by (I guess the waitress the other one talked about?) and saw that we were half way through our chips & salsa with no drinks. She asked if we would like waters and we quickly responded, yes please.

We never received our waters although that waitress passed us over six times afterwards.

The patio was almost full, but there was only one group inside.  There were two bartenders and a whole bunch of servers which were mostly talking to each other and putting orders in.

Fifteen minutes after ordering we got our drinks, we were almost done with our chips.  At that point we were asked if we wanted to order entrees.  Based on the wait I decided to just get one BBQ chicken taco. I only had to wait about five minutes and I enjoyed the taco. But honestly it was soured by the poor experience.

I acknowledge that maybe we got the bottom of the chip bin, but the server confusion, forgetfulness and over ten minute wait for 2 drinks all on a Sunday that wasn't that busy is just disappointing.

With such a variety of taco places, I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been once and am having a hard time convincing myself to go back.  If I do...I'll definitely try the Brussels sprout nachos as I've heard nothing but good things about them.

My one and only visit so far was with a group of 6 friends.  We went on a weekend night a bit later in the evening....probably around 8.  We had no issue getting seated, but getting service was a different story.  Our took our drink order and the first round was delivered promptly, but then she disappeared and we had to wait a while to be able to put in our food order.  It took even longer for our food to be brought out to us.  I will say that the food was delicious once we got it.  The server didn't check back on us and one of us had to actually get up and ask for service for water even.  I understand a wait on a busy weekend night, but the restaurant was practically empty.  Perhaps they were understaffed that night, but if that is the case give us the FYI.  Otherwise, it just seems like we are being neglected.  If someone suggests the place to meet up, I would go back, but I don't have any big desire to make the effort to go."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Diego Pops for the first time last week while I had a friend in town visiting. I have heard great things about it, and I was not disappointed. We just decided to have drinks and chips. We arrived about 10 minutes before their happy hour ended and our waitress warned us that if we wanted their deal of half off appetizers we had to order before the ending time. I asked if we could still order drinks at happy hour and suddenly it was like a flip switched and our server went from being nice and bubbly to almost angry seeming. She responded \"no\" and quickly walked away. When she came back we order our chips and salsa and our full priced drinks (we went with drinks that weren't on the happy hour menu anyways) the Watermelon Lime Snow Cone Margaritas. The chips were really good but insanely salty, but like you know when things are really salty and it make them addicting? Yeah that's how they were haha, and our Snow Cone Margs were super yummy but didn't taste like there was any alcohol in them. We decided not to say anything as to not upset our server anymore. Want to come back for a better experience with a different serve and also try more of their food, so overall a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"The brussel sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!"}
{"text":"Yes. This place is perfect. It is exactly what I hoped for in getting tacos in Scottsdale. Quirky, fun, beautiful design. Welcoming waitstaff. Great menu. I had chips and salsa (GET THEM), tortilla soup (YES), plantain tacos (AMAZING), and a chicken adobo taco (YEP), I was blown away. This place is exactly what I love about American Mexican food. Quirky, inventive, delicious."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere at Diego Pops more than I enjoyed my lackluster corn & avocado salad for lunch. But that sunny, vacation-like ambiance truly did make up for everything. It's like a hipster beach hut in the middle of Scottsdale - so chill  and festive with neon colors and desert plants. I wish this were my backyard. 

So, now that you know how cool the vibe is, be careful with your food order. Salads over-promised and under-delivered. But the tacos looked solid, and the ice tea options were exotic. Those \"famous\" brussel sprout nachos though? Also false advertisement. They were basically normal nachos with a few brussel sprout leaves sprinkled on top. Not very exciting. 

They do have a sweet Yelp check-in offer: $5 for a taco & a beer. And service was fabulous, fast & friendly. Order wisely and you'll have a lovely time at Diego Pops."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Service was ok.  Nothing was special and the burrito was flavorless.  The guacamole was mediocre.  This place is just nothing special and no reason to return."}
{"text":"Nice selection of tequila/mezcal. Tacos are good, the fresh jalapenos are a welcome touch, but overpriced. Go on Taco Monday."}
{"text":"We were very excited to learn about Diego Pops. We have a business close by and it is fantastic to have a great place in walking distance and a great place to send people! I love the shrimp tacos! Decor and atmosphere is fun with a retro vibe. Put this on your list!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Saturday! The quesadilla and Brussels sprout nachos were delicious! Love the different sauce that Diego pops had to offer. The California burrito (not part of the HH special) was okay. Felt like too much was going on! Overall really like the environment and would like to come back here again!"}
{"text":"We LOVED Diego Pops. Great service and great food. I ordered two margarita pitchers (watermelon mint and prickly pear) and plantain tacos. They were all amazing! 10/10 would go back"}
{"text":"Nice decor and vibe. I loved the indoor/outdoor setting. It's a great place to watch a game, hang out with friends, or have a family outing.

Unfortunately, not very vegetarian friendly. Only one veggie taco available - Plantain Taco. It was definitely interesting, but personally not my taste in tacos. I did like the option to have a corn or flour tortilla with my taco. Really disappointed no one brought be the sauce tray, especially since I'm a big condiment person. 

Guacamole and salsa was delicious! Too spicy for me, but the best I've had in town. 

Three stars because I would definitely come back to hang out with friends and have some snacks, however, I wouldn't come back just for dinner."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great atmosphere and their brussel sprout nachos are to die for!! Sooo good!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and grabbed a seat at the outdoor bar.  It wasn't a crazy hot day and with the fan they had going outside, it was very pleasant.  Turned out Sunday is all day Happy Hour.  Woohoo!  Had some house margs, street corn queso, and the brussel sprout nachos (after the bartender said they were the best nachos he's ever had).  OMG...they were soooo good!  Incredibly rich, but so good.  Great food, great service.  Can't ask for more than that.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was expecting average Mexican but was blown away. This is taco shop prices with foodie approval worthy combos. The brussel sprout nachos were a surprising burst of flavor with the pickled onion and egg on top. I will be dreaming about them for days.

Our table tried each of the tacos and were pleased with the flavor and tenderness of the meat. The chicken tortilla soup didn't disappoint the heaping serving had large chunks of chicken and freshly cubed avocado. My husband the finicky eater ordered the Sonoran Hot Dog. It was high beef hot dog wrapped in Texas toast and he loved every bite of it. The mango habanero wings were also a win.

Save your money and don't get the beans and rice they were lack luster and a bit bland. Our only complaint was our server was a bit slow on drinks and we had to keep getting up to order more. As a tequila snob I was pleased with the house margarita but wanted a kick so the bartender added fresh jalapeños. 

I hope to make it back when we come to town for their happy hour. This place is great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's right in between the fine dining of Mission and Loco Patron. 

We ordered the guacamole, bbq tacos, chicken lime bowl and salmon bowl. Each had its own unique flavorful taste. We were satisfied with every one. I don't think you go wrong with ordering food from here!

It paired nicely with a michilada, which was made well and not poorly like most bar. There was crushed salt on the rim, real tomato juice and a big juicy lime. 

Everything came out fast, the waitress was prompt with refilling our waters and taking good care of us. We even got a deal for checking in on yelp! A taco and beer combo for $5!

We will be back because it's a great little lunch spot."}
{"text":"The other week I went with my boyfriend to try this restaurant. I have since emailed the management as a form of helpful feedback and have yet to receive a reply. This was my letter regarding our unfortunate experience:

Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant due to high recommendations. The food was fairly good- but I wanted to bring a service issue to your attention. Our waitress was rather quiet and challenging to hear- especially when we asked kindly for her to repeat the item description we asked about. We were not being serviced properly, and my boyfriend had to GET UP to get the hot sauce tray himself. Finally- towards the end of our experience, we had to flag someone down to get us a to go box. I'm sure this was an isolated incident, but I wanted to bring this to your attention in hopes that other first time patrons experience a more enjoyable meal. I am constantly dining out, and I don't remember the last time the service was so disappointing. 
Two stars for decent food."}
{"text":"I have been here many times but this was my first time sitting at the bar. Service at the bar was awesome there were three bartenders asking if we needed anything which was awesome. LOVE the margaritas. Especially the one in the coconut shell. Diego pops is a must try!"}
{"text":"I went into diego pops today and was greeted and sat by a very friendly and attentive server named Anthony. 
He was able to make sure we had an amazing experience by suggesting many different tacos which were delicious as well as their watermelon mint margaritas which come in pitchers!
I highly recommend this place and ask for Anthony! He will make sure you have an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Super solid tacos and such. Great Monday deal with $2 and $3 tacos and a happy hour from 3-6 with half price apps and drink specials. We started with really good chips and the 7-8 bottles of salsa that come with it for $1. Great chips and great variety of salsas. The Diego Pops margarita was small and weak for my taste (even for $4), Tacos, on the other hand, were really good. I had a fish taco, a pastor, and an adobo chicken taco. All great, and $7 for the 3 of 'em. I had a taste of my friend's plaintain taco, carne asada and shrimp, and they were all super, as well. We had churro fries (dulce de leche dipping sauce) for dessert. Meh. Tasty, but nothing special. Great service, and a nice cool patio. If you like Joyride and other \"upscaled\" taco joints, you'll like this. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food and an amazing selection of unique drinks. They have a great selection of tequila and mezcal, up to and including a shot that's $80! I did not try it...but I will one day. 

Ashlyn, our bartender, was the best! She is so friendly and accommodating! My friend and I were interested in the mezcal and thankfully she let us try it first. The best I can say is that it's an acquired taste!

I'm really into Diego Pop's. Great drinks and great service, especially at the  bar. It's also not too crowded so you can get your drinks and food quickly. Margaritas are on lock.

If you are in Scottsdale check it out!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after following them on IG and seeing how great everything looked in pics. I'm sad to say I'd likely not come back after our experience yesterday. Three of us sat on the patio at the bar. The bartender was friendly but did not provide good service. We had to ask for silverware multiple times after receiving food, I asked for no salt on my margaritas and still got them with salt, my friends margaritas were not even filled fully, and the drinks were SO weak. A petite girl should have a mild buzz at minimum after drinking 4 margaritas....it felt like we were wasting our money and so we left to go to a neighboring bar/restaurant. On the positive I thought the place was cute, patio is a decent size,  their HH prices are very reasonable and the salsa was good. My bf said his tacos were ok as well."}
{"text":"Cute outdoor patio. Our outdoor reservation wasn't honored and we were sat inside. We wanted this cute little place to be fantastic, unfortunately it wasn't. Our table was abandoned and we felt shunned as if we were lepers. Our drink orders were received late and spastically when we simply ordered \"another round\". Our table was left un-bussed and waters empty. Apps, were dropped on the table before our first round. My tacos were not fresh from the frig cold but far from warm.
When it was time for finish up our second and last visit to Diego the waitress sprang to life and retrieved our bill in under 30 seconds. I'd have been nice if she would have been able to deliver our first round in under 30 seconds, in reality it was closer to 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday for the snow cone margaritas. Margaritas were the best of both worlds. Reminds you of your childhood but they are filled with tequila!  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful! Bar was gorgeous and the service was great! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The reasoning for my 3 stars is disheartening for me to review with. We just recently went there for a Sunday fun day and we were a fairly large group which they accommodated immediately and got us sat quickly. I do get that we were a large group, but, I felt it took a little too long for us to receive our drinks. Our server was extra friendly but it was obvious he was nervous serving such a large party. I feel if he had extra support from management these things would of been avoided. It took us at least 20 minutes to receive our first cocktails at our table after ordering them. Again the server was awesome and friendly so I don't blame him for that. I felt as I observed around that we were the closest table near the kitchen that it was obvious we were large and our server needed help running drinks from the bartender it wasn't that busy that someone especially higher up in management would consider coming by to help and support the waiter. That is the only feedback I can give that is negative but the food is completely recommended. I had the shrimp taco and steak taco and they were super yummy. Our table also got ceviche and Brussel sprouts nachos, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! The Queso is delicious and Steve and Michael were so friendly. Great service, bar, and food!"}
{"text":"What happened Diegos?

I used to love this place when it first opened up. The brussel sprout nachos, tacos, drinks-- everything was spot on. Over the last few months this place has just gone downhill. Everytime I come in it seems like the food gets worse.

In my most recent experience, my friends and I met for happy hour here. The margaritas were good, no problems there. Service was okay. Food was not good. The consensus at the entire table (8 or 9 people) was that the food was expensive for what it was, greasy, and unsatisfying. Diegos used to have an edgy menu and great food! I got two tacos $3.50-$4 each and they were so boring, tasteless, and left me still very hungry. Second dinner, anyone? The crispy taco shell was just so greasy and barely had any chicken. When your entire table orders different menu items and everyone has the same opinion, you know something is wrong!

I would really hesitate to come back here. I think they need to take a look at their quality and make some adjustments or refresh the menu in some way. With all the amazing taco places & happy hour places in Old Town I would put Diegos at the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"Adorable place! I picked up an order from the bar and the gentleman working greeted me with the warmest, most beautiful smile. Awesome service!!!! 

I ordered the pineapple braised pork and poke with scallions. Every flavor was perfectly perfect! 

Decor wise, it is probably the cutest and most original place in Scottsdale, it literally took my breath away. I'll be back for dessert!"}
{"text":"I can't make this stuff up. You order chicken NO onions and get beef with onions. Something similar to this happens every time. We recently had a great experience here and thought maybe they had made some changes but I think we were wrong. It is so clear every time we go here that the servers do not care at all."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! We stopped here for dinner one evening on vacation, and I was really happy with our experience. I highly recommend happy hour margaritas, brussel sprouts nachos, and the burritos. We sat at the outdoor bar area, service was kinda slow for the food and taking orders but drinks were refilled quickly so three margaritas into it and I really didn't care so much about my food taking a good amount of time... we were all happy to sit their and sip our dinner instead!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were absolutely incredible.  And the ceviche.  And very cool ambience & decor.  And great prices.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try! They have a wide variety of Mexican food, vegetarian friendly, great appetizers... The Brussels sprouts nachos are to DIE FOR. 

The vibe and ambiance is truly one of a kind... It's a modern cantina feel with indoor and outdoor seating, with a bar outside, perfect on a sunny day. Satisfy all your Healthy (ish) Mexican food desires!"}
{"text":"I love Diego Pops; it's one of my favorite places in Old Town but I was sadly disappointed with my last visit. We ordered the habanero mango wings, excited for the spice and flavor (like the foodies we are) but was so painfully disappointed when the wings had little to no flavor and absolutely ZERO habanero or mango. The wings were good from a standpoint of meaty and juicy but they had absolutely no flavor. Obviously, we eat there for the tacos but I was expecting this to be a good speciality from Diego Pops but felt I could have received the same wings from Zips."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is to die for. The queso was so good, the taco bowl option was so amazing and such a good deal! We left so full and so happy. Rebecca gave wonderful service and it sounded like she really was passionate about the company and her employees. I'll be stopping by much more often!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great drink specials and when the Red headed bartender goes bra-less it's even better!"}
{"text":"We went here for taco Tuesday!! Although they don't do taco Tuesday they actually do taco MONDAY... we still had an amazing time!! Skyler was our server and she was new but the best one there! She was absolutely amazing and we enjoyed her company. Diëgo pops has a variety of Mexican food and delicious drinks. Everything we had was delicious and also a good environment. It was our first time there and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Guava margarita.   Holy moly.  Straight. Out of a coconut   Brussels sprout nachos!!!!!  Coconut icecream is perfection."}
{"text":"The margaritas are really good... not too sweat. The green chili chicken tacos were very good. We had the chicken tortilla soup and it was probably the best we have ever had."}
{"text":"Great service! Very pleasant and attentive waitress. Cute little place with parking and a hip decor. 
Food was tasty. I had brussels sprout nachos. Very few brussel sprouts. Tasty. 
Drinks were refreshing."}
{"text":"Tbis place is overrated. Wait staff not helpful or knowledgable. My daughter and I  ordered the same drink they came looking different. Food was good they do not have a blender?"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Diego Pops for some time now, especially with their Brussel Sprout nachos. I love Brussel sprouts, if you cook and season them correctly so I was so excited to try this place. 

It is south of the Montauk and the restaurant has their own private parking lot but it is small. When we walked in, we immediately dig the vibe - kinda like a 60's diner. The employees right away were really friendly. Our server went over the menu and we decided on the famous Brussel sprout nachos, a cod taco with flour tortilla and a beef machaca taco with a crispy taco. 

The nachos were a generous portion!! I suggest you share with a group of at least 4 people. We practically only made a dent. It was good, no doubt about that. The tacos though - eh, not so much. They were okay. The flavors just didn't mesh well together and the crispy cod was a little soggy. 

We then ordered a churro sundae for dessert. They top the vanilla ice cream with dulce de leche and it was pretty yummy. The churros that came with it needed some work though. I didn't think they were that great, but I ate it because the combination of the cinnamon and ice cream was good. 

Our bill wasn't bad. It's not crazy cheap but not over the top either. I wouldn't go back for the tacos, but I would go back to try the other items on the menu and take advantage of their happy hour."}
{"text":"When I go out to restaurants, I don't only think of food when it comes to rating my overall experience, service and atmosphere are both very important as well. Diego Pops takes my mind straight to Palm Springs, they have a very colorful, mid-century and modern decor with spunky signs. My favorite part is their outdoor bar area. It is beautiful and it let's you enjoy their ambience while also spending time outdoor in the warm Scottsdale sunshine. 

FOOD: Let's talk about what we are really here for! 
Unlike most Mexican restaurants, they have TACO MONDAY! Wooho. $3 tacos. Even salmon, shrimp and steak. 

We ordered almost every flavor and they were all delicious. 

I also ordered the Steak Skirt Bowl, very good but a little bland. However, they do offer a variety of 6 house specialty sauces that are AMAZING. Amongs them they have cilantro, chipotle, beets, and habanero sauce. I definetly recomend trying them all. 

DRINKS: YUMM! 
We ordered the watermelon margaritas, I really enjoy the settled taste of watermelon and the fact that it was not very sweet. Very refreshing . 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a nice deal. $4 margaritas. Came here with 2 friends on a Tuesday night. Service was good and the food came out fast. Definitely recommend. Nice atmosphere and cute decor!"}
{"text":"Go to spot for bringing out of towners! Perfect location. Great spot to grab dinner before the bars or to sit on the patio on a Saturday for lunch."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place. My sister and I ordered food for carry out: one taco, one burrito, and the brussels sprout nachos. After sharing the nachos, I was full, so I saved my burrito for the next day. I ordered the breakfast burrito without bacon because I am a vegetarian. They didn't put bacon in the burrito, but the did add giant pieces of chicken in it and now I can't eat it. This was my first time trying Diego Pops and now I don't know if I can trust this restaurant."}
{"text":"1st time here and I enjoyed my time alot. The music was a very nice touch to the delicious food. I ordered a crispy cod taco and my wife ordered a breakfast burrito. the taco came out delicious it tasted fresh and had a sweet taste to it. the salsa was also flavorful and homemade. the service was excellent waitress was nice and attentive. the breakfast burrito also tasted fresh and had adequate spices. i enjoyed my experience and salsa was awesome. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great little dive bar of Tacos and Cocktails.  Bartender knowledgeable about the area for me bing out of town, was a great plus.  3 Tacos will fill you up well."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Green Chili Chicken Taco was amazing, and I would highly recommend asking for Britney (sp?) as your server- she was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Best nachos in town. The Brussels sprouts on top really ice it something extra!! Love that they give you a holder with 6 sauces to put on whatever you order also. Used to be all day hh on Sunday but that sadly changed"}
{"text":"Honestly, not my favorite place. Service is crap. Drinks are mediocre at best. Better places in the valley to get tacos and margaritas."}
{"text":"Fun vibe with great outdoor seating and bar area.  We tried three different tacos, chicken, pork & salmon and all were excellent.  If you don't like a sauce, they will leave it off and bring you eight more to choose from at your table, all homemade and delicious.  If you like salsa, don't skip the salsa & chips.  It isn't free like most Mexican restaurants, but it is far more tasty!  It too is made fresh daily and the heat can vary.  Last week it was milder, last night almost too hot for me, but my wife LOVED it.  Had to bring home an extra order!  We are going back."}
{"text":"I love the space, it has a very clever mix of retro and contemporary. From the case of $2 Chocolate Tacos to the canvas of Frida Kalo, the neon sign on the wall that says \"there is no place like Mexico\" and the left green old school refrigerator stocked with glass bottles of refriscos and coca cola.

First off, their happy hour from 3-6 is unbelievable.  All appetizers  are half  off, so you can enjoy  their very famous and delectable Brussels sprout nachos and coconut lemongrass ceviche for half the price. Wash that  down with the Diego margarita for only $4 (lime, triple sec, simple syrup, house tequila) and your tab for two is $21 during happy hour.

Roasted garlic beet cream is to die for. The Habanero oil is a must try and adds subtle heat but buttery delicious flavor.

Lemongrass coconut  ceviche is an incredible summer appetizer. Perfect blend of crunchy fresh shrimp, paired with flavors of coconut and lemongrass, and little bit of heat from Fresno chili.

The street corn queso makes the nachos, and there just isn't anything I don't love here.

Finish the night at the 'Treat Bar', which has ice cream, Churro fries, chocolate ice cream and chocolate tacos.

Love love love!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow on beer order. Food came out before we got our beer. Had the shrimp bowl with brown rice and black beans. It definitely needed the hot sauces. Which they bring out a nice variety of to the table. Pork and pineapple bowl was very flavorful and our toddler liked it too. Prices fair but shrimp bowl needs more seasoning"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the music. Food is one of a kind, drinks are amazing and they face great desserts!! It's definitely a vacation type restaurant belongs on a beachside somewhere. Love it. Pulled pineapple braised pork tacos are the best #mmm"}
{"text":"I ordered the braised green chili chicken, charred skirt steak, braised pineapple porky and grilled shrimp tacos. Polished the order off with stewed pinto beans.

This place could be a franchise!"}
{"text":"5 stars bc this place has lots of scrumptious options AND is totally affordable especially during happy hour!!

Highlight of the show for me were the BRUSSELS SPROUT NACHOS. My friends looked at me strangely as I rejoiced over this combo, but honestly, I have no idea what they were so weirded out by - how is street corn queso/pickled onion/garlic beet/runny fried egg/brussels sprouts not a more frequent combo around because it definitely should be. To top off the flavor combination perfect, um it was $5 during HH. Is that not a dream!? All the friends that looked at me strangely admit that it was way better than they expected. 
+ $4 HH margs and not a single complaint. 

Since I essentially ate all the nachos myself, I only got a beef machaca taco + Especial beer ($5 if you check in on yelp!). The taco wasn't tasty, but paled in comparison to the above nachos. My friends that tried the beef machaca said they liked the crispy cod more.

Ambiance and music enjoyable (I loved the couches!) I definitely want to come back and eventually try EVERYTHING on the HH menu!

**TIP: Bring cash for valet"}
{"text":"I must say as many times as we've ordered from here the food and service is usually amazing. Disappointed today! I was told the order would be ready in 15 mins arrived at the 15 mins only to wait 30 mins for our order. The amount of fish on the crust cod tacos was just sad. I've seen bigger fish sticks."}
{"text":"We got the sweet corn queso (really good $7), shrimp tacos (pretty good) and bean and cheese burrito (ok). I liked the atmosphere and food was good though."}
{"text":"This place had been on my \"to try\" list for awhile and while it was good, it didn't live up to the hype. The tacos were nothing to write home to mom about and definitely needed the sauces they give you. The sauces were really good. I have no idea what is in that pink sauce, all I know is that I like it. Do yourself a favor and get the Brussels sprouts nachos. That's the only reason I'll be returning. They are amazing and piled high with quest fresco and Brussels sprouts (trust me on this)"}
{"text":"The food was great. If you go in before 6, you get 50% off the appetizers. I got a steak bowl and it was really good. It had rice and beans in it. Jessica was our server and she was on task. If you go to Diego Pops, ask for Jessica. I would Definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"The highlights were the Brussels sprout nachos and michelada...service was ehhh, took the waitress a while to bring the drinks and the overall pace was rather slow (it wasn't very crowded) I didn't like the pokè at all, looked like it was pre made and just rather sad looking...the avocado was turning brown and the tuna pieces were tiny. The atmosphere was cool and the drinks were good just not sure I'd go back for the food."}
{"text":"What is better than Taco Tuesday? Taco Monday! $3 tacos that are perfectly delish! Go all out and get the street corn queso! We will definitely be back when visiting the area"}
{"text":"On a road trip from Portland to Tucson and this is, without a doubt, the best food we've had yet.   Actually, the pineapple pork burrito was the best burrito I've ever eaten.  And the guava coconut cocktail was delish too.  I would love to come back to Old Scottsdale and spend some more time rather than just overnight."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I were wandering around Scottsdale looking for a place to grab drinks and an appetizer, and we stumbled across a huge sign that said \"TACOS\" out front. As we approached the building, I still wasn't convinced that it was a Mexican restaurant. However, when we got closer to  Diego Pops, I realized we were at someplace special. There was an indoor/outdoor bar, and as soon as we walked into the front door, the vibe was very unique and we didn't want to leave. We sat at the bar and had some of the BEST margaritas and chips, salsa, and guacamole. They also have a tray of unbelievable homemade sauces to satisfy every tastebud. A must go to! 
P.S. Nick was a great bartender and Rebecca was bomb at explaining everything! We will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"NOT accommodating for parties larger than 4.  We have now tried on 3 separate occasions to come here with a party of 5, 6, and 8.  First time we had to point out a table of 5 to the hostess.  Second time, the hostess stared at us when we said 6, and said shed have to ask her manager what the wait time would be, and then never returned.  Most recent time, I tried to make a reservation for 8 people on a Friday night, apparently they only have one table on the patio for 8 people and its reserved.  Guess they can't move tables/put two tables together.  Odd they are so eager to turn away big parties.  

Only reason for 2 stars is because of the cute decor/patio and brussels sprout nachos."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times and love this place! I always get the brussel sprout nachos because they are TO DIE FOR! The crispy cod tacos are really good and so is the Sonoran hot dog! You can't really go wrong with anything on this menu! The prices are pretty average, and the service is great! Definitely a place to stop by if you're in Old Town Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Food was not good!! It was cold and everything was far from authentic Mexican food. I don't even recommend any appetizers. The only thing I give Diego pops is it is visually appealing and the vibe is cool, all the workers are really nice. If they just made better quality food this place would be awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. Guac is great, shrimp and plantain tacos are phenomenal, and the snow cone margaritas are soooooo delicious"}
{"text":"Ok Mexican food for the price. Not the best in Old Town, but good for a group that wants to catch up and enjoy company"}
{"text":"We love Diego Pops tacos but previously we had been unimpressed with the service, today however we were blown away. Amanda was extremely attentive and friendly. She always there anytime we needed anything. Corey the manager even came by to ask how everything was. Great attention to service! 

We were here for happy hour and the $4 margaritas and half priced apps are such a great deal. We also love their crispy cod taco. AMAZE. Definitely make a trip to Diego Pops on your next trip to Old Town."}
{"text":"Tacos were good, service was good. Neither were great. I've been here twice and I like the tacos and the sauce caddie. Oh my god why did you rate it so low? It's a Mexican restaurant and they had nothing spicy. Nothing. I asked and I was greeted with a shrug. I asked other employees, another shrug. \" you mean you have no spicy salsa, sauce, nothing spicy!!!\" \" no sorry sir this is Scottsdale\". I'm not a spicy freak to be clear. They don't have Tabasco or anything even close to being hot. They have  \"habanero oil\". When I asked if it was hot the sever told me \"only if you think vegetable oil is hot cause that's what it is\" she was telling the truth. Literally! I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"First timer at Diego Pope and came highly recommended from my bf! All he talks about are the Brussels sprout nachos and they exceeded my expectations. 
Our server Ben was great! 
Now for the bad. The $14 Margarita was weak. Also, There was a pub crawl, which I'm cool with! But they were obviously louder than normal and pretty obnoxious. The thing that made me mad was the manager apologized to every table by us. And gave out comps to those customers and not us. Probably because we were younger and the other tables were older crowds. 
All in all the food and the waiter were  awesome but the overall experience was not too great today."}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 of us who attempted to Barrio Queens first at 2:00pm on a Tuesday in December but they were too full so we went to Diego Pops. We were glad we did! They were pretty empty so we got seated right away. Our waiter was wonderful, the food was delicious, the prices were pretty low and the ambience was cute. There's also great kid options. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Looking for great tacos? Check. 
Friendly staff? Check. 
Great atmosphere? Check. 

Diego pops is a great spot if you are looking for all 3 of the topics mentioned. You must try their corn queso too, amazing! Been back here at least 5 times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Make sure to check in here! You get a beer and a taco for $5 when you do! 

The tacos are a bit pricey for street tacos, but you are in Scottsdale. 

We loved each taco we had here and opted for the chef to choose which type of shell/tortilla we should have with the meat we chose. 

It's a nice little spot with good food and a very friendly staff. We came at the end of happy hour which their menu (mainly the prices) were very appetizing! 

We will be back the next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for lunch for the first time because we wanted tacos & we were not disappointed. We both wanted a margarita & the waitress suggested a pitcher of the house marg which we later calculated to be the better deal (one glass = $7 ; we got 2.5 glasses EACH out of the pitcher and it was only $24 -- saved $11!!). The margarita was delicious! Then my boyfriend got 2 charred skirt steak tacos & I got one skirt steak & one crispy cod. They were SO good. I would DEFINITLY come back."}
{"text":"Love. Great food/music/ambience/service/drinks 
Love love. Wish we had one of these back in Orange County."}
{"text":"Really dug this place.  So much we went twice in a 3 days.  First trip was lunch. Pineapple Pork and Chili Chicken were great tacos. Great service from a nice girl from Connecticut. She was clearly very new but that didn't stop her from giving us a great experience. Second trip was dinner. A leisurely 15 minute wait with beers at the bar was no big deal.  They sat us at an extra large table outside which made for easy sharing. Only complaint... no plantains.  Can't wait to come back soon when I am in AZ"}
{"text":"You ever have a slight disappointment and then someone moves heaven and earth to fix it?  That happened tonight.  The Manager on duty tonight, he went above and beyond to take care of me.  So appreciated!!  And the food?  WORTH any wait.  I recommend Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"Taco Monday was perfect here. A pitcher of margs, fabulous tacos, a great patio and fantastic service. Nothing better!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Instagram and wanted to check it out. It is a very cool place! The decor is Mexico meets SoCal and I loved the vibe there. I got a toasted coconut margarita served in a baby coconut and it was delicious. I also got the pineapple pork toco and the chicken quesadilla... both were great too. The churro sundae was my favorite though. You have to get desert if you go! I gave them 4 stars because the service took a long time hand they messed up our order. However the waitress was very nice and gave us a free shot for the service errors. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"What a great place!! We're were walking around looking for some food and stumbled across Diego Pops and decided to stop in.  So glad we did!!  Bartenders were awesome and so friendly and the apps were awesome!! They recommended the nachos as they are not your normal nachos and a said were a customer fave.  Omg!! They were delish!!  Egg and brussell spouts on nachos.??  So good!!!  Will definitely come by again next time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"First time here! Since it is Sunday the appetizers are all 50% off. We ordered:  guacamole, wings, ceviche, street corn queso and the brussels sprout nachos.  - All delish!  Wow!

As Arnold said - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Diego Pops multiple times and I ONLY go back for the food. It is the only thing that saves this place. The servers every time I go in there I am prepared for them to be TERRIBLE and it always is. You wait for about 20 mins for you drinks to be made after you order them (the waiters never come while you wait so you can order) and they are VERY weak, but then the wait staff does not come back and check on you at all then it takes forever to order or get their attention. Fire EVERYONE except the cooks that works there and get some servers who know how to serve and are competent. Maybe my last time going in there since serves truly are the worst. Maybe try Loco Patron for your taco needs. At least, they know how to serve and check on their section."}
{"text":"Come here on happy hour and get the pitcher of margarita and the Brussel sprouts Nachos . You read that right , Brussel sprouts . I was apprehensive at first but the bartender said I wouldn't regret them . They come with an over easy egg and this pink sauce that's out of this world . The best part ? They are 5$ On happy hour! Do your self a favor and check this place out and get the Brussel sprout Nachos . They are a game changer ."}
{"text":"There was a mistake with our reservation pushing it back one hour. Corey was extremely accommodating and very apologetic, giving us drinks at a sister restaurant and significantly discounting what turned out to be an excellent dinner. Very good food, very good customer service in light of the mix up."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, salsa, and dessert. Make sure you try the churro sundae. Great service, too! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Diego Pops is super cute on the inside, but very cramped. They were really busy and the line for the bathroom was outside the door. The tacos were good, I wouldn't come back for them specifically. The quest corn dip, however, was amazing. It was a little cottage-cheesey and chunky, but so delicious! Our waitress was super helpful and had great menu recommendations."}
{"text":"If you took out the server's attitude it would have made for a better experience. It was not appreciated and did not go with the laid-back atmosphere. Our server made it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our orders...

Beyond that, the food was good. Definitely try the brussels sprout nachos-who would've thought?! I also had the braised pork taco, grilled shrimp taco, and plantain taco. Even though they are street tacos they do a good job of packing in the flavor and quantity of food in each tortilla. Highly recommend making resies."}
{"text":"Trendy and cool! Food good with spots of brilliance.     I tried the skirt steak in a bowl. It was really good, kinda like comfort food. For me when a place stocks 1942... I know it's got potential! Indoor and outdoor seating. If your in the mood for a great vibe and solid Mexican, do drop by!"}
{"text":"Tacos are good. They have a carousel of random sauces to choose from to enhance your taco/nacho experience. This place is very hip right now."}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner! We were seated quickly, a group of three on a Thursday night. Service was a little slow at times, but we didn't mind. Plenty of time to chat and dine. SnoCone Margarita was so fun and they added some jalapeño spice for me!  Poke was fresh and delicious.  So many awesome sauces! Try them all. Lastly, do not forget to save room for dessert.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food fun atmosphere, good date spot, prickly pear marg is where it's at, crispy cod and steak tacos are legit. Steven our server was great! He managed a big group of us with great service."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but the service makes it not even close to worth it. The service always disappoints every single time. There has yet to be a time where my order is correct, the bill is correct, or the waitresses act like they care. The manager called me on my personal phone to tell me I'll be charged for A DOLLAR next time I come in because I put sauce on my to go order without paying for it. As much as I enjoy the tacos, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place really is so cute and retro, the food is great and fresh, is made to order. I always get the Brussel sprout nachos.... Don't freak out it's so good so just try it!!!"}
{"text":"Brussel sprout nachos, crispy cod taco and grilled shrimp taco were all wonderful and super tasty. Combine that with a fresh margarita, wonderful ambiance and kind service and you get yourselves five stars. Great outdoor, shaded seating but the indoors looked tastefully decorated! Would be back here in a heartbeat if we lived here!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Tacos in All of Arizona. Cory and his crew serve up some of the best tacos i have tried.  Carne Asada and Pineapple Pork are my Faves.  Can't wait to try the Brussels Sprout Nachos"}
{"text":"We landed in Phoenix for a bachelorette party. We had some time to kill so of course we needed to get the party started. Diego Pops was just the place. The food was delicious and the drinks were stiff, just the way we like them. The queso was out of this world-- different than we expected but SO good! The brussel spout nachos were life changing. If you're into sweet drinks, the snow cone margaritas were thirst quenching and so good! We would definitely return to Diego Pops... Sam our server was a gem!!!"}
{"text":"Steve is by far the best bartender in town. Great house margaritas even during happy hour! Great atmosphere and great food, will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Our server Anthony was the man, super personable and had great recommendations. Made our experience at Diego Pops very relaxed!"}
{"text":"Perfect location, great service, nice ambience, the cocktails and the Brussel Sprout Nachos are my fav!"}
{"text":"Best burritos with steak and the bowls  :) The place has great location and cool design. Parking is a little small, but in old town its the major problem everywhere"}
{"text":"Came here based off of our craving for Mexican food & fellow yelper reviews. 
Salsa- very tasty! It was a little different that your normal salsa given at restaurants. This one had a slightly smokey flavor. 
Tortilla chips & plantain chips- we got the dual mix of chips. They were both very crisp and fresh. Not oily & perfectly salted. The only downside to our batch was that the plantain chips were broken and crumbled up... like if we got the bottom of the bunch. 
Pork tacos- very flavorful & juicy meat. The corn Tortilla was so fresh that it just broke apart when trying to pick up the taco. 
We didn't get to try any fancy drinks, however the drink served in the fresh young coconut looked delicious! 
Lastly, it was 100+ degrees, we were seated outside & the misters around the bar definitely topped off our experience! 

We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas. I'd stay away from the bowls - the shrimp bowl was disappointing, but the tacos are delicious. A fun place to hangout with your friends."}
{"text":"First review of 2017! My friend and I loved this spot. I suggested it since we wanted somewhere in Old Town and it was one of my bookmarks. We started off with drinks; I got Mexican Sprite (tasted similar to regular Sprite) and my friend got iced tea. I already know I wanted to order the brussels sprouts nachos from the rave reviews and my friend wanted guacamole so we ordered both. SO MANY CHIPS. I loved the nachos; the sprouts were charred and lots of flavor with the peppers, corn, cheese and the extra sauces they brought to our table. It was fun trying them all. Happy hour meant appetizers were half off, great deal.

We decided to also get shrimp tacos on flour tortilla and I thought it was delicious. You can choose corn or crispy tortilla and get rice and other sides with it for more money. Diego Pops doesn't do Taco Tuesday BUT they do have Taco Monday, which gets them twice the customers for those thinking they have special deals on Tuesday. 

Our server was friendly and funny and the place itself is cute. We sat outside as did most everyone else and they had heaters and candles to set the ambiance. I'd come back, they've got a good selection of items on their menu and food was tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour... left very satisfied.  $3 beer, 1/2 price appetizers... cmon, what more do you want?  The brussels sprouts nachos didn't disappoint and the fried egg on top was a nice touch.  The garlic beet crema and serrano ranch sauces were great additions, but don't overlook the guajillo chile one :)  Despite being full, I ordered the pork/pineapple taco and its one I would order again.  Surprising, because I'm super fussy about how pork is prepared.  My dad ordered the chicken tortilla soup.  Flavor was close to homemade, and I liked the taste, but I'm a white chicken meat purist and seeing some dark meat in the soup was off-putting for me.  Again, that didn't impact the flavor, but I wouldn't order it for myself.

Best time to come here would probably be Monday since they also have their tacos for $2 in addition to the other happy hour specials.

Yum."}
{"text":"Just got back from there and my experience falls in line with what others have said.  Food was awesome, but don't go during peak time.  The service is pretty bad.  Our server completely forgot our appetizer and went back to put it in 20 minutes after we had ordered it.  The kitchen was backed up so of course it came out with the tacos.  It wouldn't have been a huge deal if we weren't starving.  It's too bad, because I really liked the food but it's gonna be hard to convince my fiance that we should go back."}
{"text":"**Service denial of a federally protected class**
On the evening of Saturday, September 16- I brought 3 out of town guests to dine at what used to be my favorite Mexican spot in Scottsdale. I requested a table for 4 outdoors with an extra chair. The hostess told me immediately she was not able to to bring me an extra chair. When asked why- she stated this is the \"policy\" of the restaurant. I asked to speak with a manager. The female \"manager\" on duty that evening, also in the same robotically trained tone, told me the same thing. You see, 4 months ago I almost lost my leg in a car accident when a man hit me and pinned me between two cars. I cannot sit for extended periods of time without being able to elevate my leg. I am just starting to be able to leave the house and this was a special occasion among friends for me to be able to get out for the evening. This female manager was extremely rude and kept repeating herself they would not \"inconvenience\" other guests and it was their policy to not allow an extra chair at my table, even though I am disabled and have special handicap passes provided to me by the government. When asked, she clearly stated it was the owner's policy to not allow this extra chair assistance. As you can see from my photographs, during our dinner- there were plenty of tables open from which an extra chair could have been borrowed and utilized until the restaurant was so packed, not one chair could be spared. Our table was in the back and completely out of any space that an extra chair would have been a fire hazard, gotten in any guests way or even a servers path. In my 20 years of restaurant experience, I would NEVER deny a person in special need of ANYTHING to make their intentional visit to my restaurant as comfortable as possible. Several guests could see my discomfort throughout our dinner and offered me the extra chair from their table, but the server was told to watch my table and not to allow it- and I had to politely decline as I didn't want my entire parties night to be ruined. I have never been made to feel so policed and so discarded as I was this evening at Diego Pops. I will NEVER return to this establishment, and I will NEVER send any more friends here either. It's quite a shame as I have been coming since it opened and it's become a favorite hot spot for my friends and family and I to dine.  I am Vegan and so is my boyfriend and because of the plantain tacos and vegan rice and beans options, it's a great pick for us. Anyway, I am absolutely disgusted by the complete and utter disregard by this staff and so called manager for my special needs and rights. This behavior is not only illegal, but really just quite disgusting in general. I certainly hope it is NOT the practice of the owner to deny his guests, with plenty of options to dine in our on-demand, rebounding economy- their basic human rights. Shame on you Diego Pops. Shame on you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Tried it for a taco Tuesday this week to try a new place and will be coming back for Happy Hour for sure. The HH prices are unreal for the quality of food! Half off Apps....... yes please! 
Great variety of food as well, the green chilli quesadilla was so good I ordered two and the salsa was on point! 

Down side no taco Tuesday specials but they say they do them on Monday. Taco Monday.... Guess ill be trying them out on a Monday. 
Service was really great too! Taylor was our waitress and she was perfect! Remembered all orders, had a great personality and was fun to banter with in food selections. 

Wish there was more larger table settings outside. Only had tables of 2,4 and a 6-8 table. Would of been nice to have more room to spread out. 

All in all- heck yes I'm going back and taking people!"}
{"text":"We came on a double date for happy hour. It was definitely one of the best happy hours we've been to. We had the margarita pitcher and it was actually good and strong. They have half off all appetizers so we ordered he nachos and the queso. Both were delicious and VERY fulfilling. They gave us their salsas and all of them were really good. None of the salsas are spicy (in my opinion) but still tasty. We had the green chicken taco and the pork braised pineapple tacos. I was very impressed! They are  bigger than usual and full of flavor. We also had the coconut ice cream and the churro fries. Also delicious! You have to get the coconut ice cream, it's a must. 
Our server Britney was the best! She was attentive, nice and fun. She kept up with us as we got a little buzzed. Seriously, she made the experience that much better. 
Overall we will definitely be going back because we loved the happy hour prices, tacos, appetizers, drinks and the awesome service."}
{"text":"We tried this place, we wanted to like it. My friends were all about it. But the service was so-so. The tacos were nothing worth writing home about and I wasn't impressed with any of the food we got. It was bigger than it looks outside. The space was nice and when it cools down, the patio looks like the place to be. I may give happy hour a shot. My friend got a girlie drink, can't remember which one and she liked it a lot, Some fruity mojito... so if that's your thing, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Shout out to Maddie (Iowa gal)! We came here for a bachelorette and Maddie went above and beyond. Thank you for the friendly and fun service... and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Craving Mexican food while in Scottsdale I asked the concierge at our hotel for THE BEST (casual) spot in the area; she recommended Diego Pops. Hardly the best I'm sorry to say, but quite disappointed. It was \"OK\". The brussel sprout nachos were a surprisingly good change of pace for nachos, quite tasty (thank you to our server who recommended them!), watermelon and Paloma margaritas were pretty good (Paloma was the better of the 2), but my bean & cheese burrito was boring (no sauce, just a tortilla filled with refried beans and cheese.... no jalepenos, no sauce, nada, again, OK but I make better at home. The adobo chicken tacos were ok, the pineapple pork ones were better. I read other reviews that stated the staff aren't shy to remind you when it's closing time and this was our case as well. Very polite but basically \"Last call at the bar would you like another?\" \"Yes please!\" then as they were set in front of us \"We're technically closed right now so no rush but we're closed.\" It was 5 minutes before the scheduled closing time. I get people are tired and want to leave but.........."}
{"text":"Great food and great drinks! I was sitting at the bar, and there was a young lady that was being trained. The manager was very rude to the trainee in front of customers. She said \" don't make drinks today\" across the bar, which I believe is something that she can say in private. She seemed to have an attitude with the trainee. Again, the food was excellent and so were the drinks. All staff was very professional and did an outstanding job. 

I had the shirt steak tacos and the Diego margaritas which were amazing. I recommend eating and drinking here. The way the manager spoke to the trainee doesn't sit well with me, especially with me owning a business myself."}
{"text":"My experience couldn't have been better. We stopped in before a concert. Had to sit at the bar because they were full. Saturday night downtown Scottsdale, who woulda thought, right? I usually hate sitting at the bar, but the bartenders made us feel welcome. I had a carne asada soft taco. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but it was delicious! All of our food was great. Very good margaritas too. When my bartender asked if I wanted another margarita and I said no, he gave me an ice water without asking. We didn't stay long, but we had a great time and great service while we were there. We Uber'd it so I didn't deal with parking."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We stopped in last week with my wife and in-laws and had a great time. The food was fantastic! Honestly, zero complaints. We ordered some chips and salsa for an appetizer to start. The salsa was very tasty and we LOVED the sauces they brought with them. The beet sauce was incredible. 3 of us ordered a few tacos and one ordered a bowl. We honestly enjoyed all our food thoroughly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner without a reservation because it states on yelp they don't take reservations. The rude hostess informed us they didn't have any tables available but there were so many empty ones. We asked why we couldn't  sit at the empty ones and she said they were reserved??"}
{"text":"Love the Nachos. Verrrrryyyy different and verrry good. The Watermelon Margarita was excellent as well as the Diego Margarita. Everytime I'm here on business is a must and usually our 1st stop for Happy Hour. 

It's in a great location. Walking distance any area hotel."}
{"text":"Why don't I go here more often!? TBH- I've only ordered the tortilla soup & Brussels sprout nachos but it is all you ever hoped and dreamed of. Tortilla soup has allllll the flavors..creamy avocado, perfect amount of cheese, chicken that Melts in your mouth, and the right broth. I can't even get started on the nachos, just do your table a favor and try them. Also, go wild with their sauces. Simply sauceome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and have never been super impressed with the food. I just keep going back for the atmosphere! I love the cute walls they have and it's just so cute it's hard to resist. The coconut spritzer was delicious and perfect for this alcohol free pregnant momma"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Shrimp ceviche was too sweet.  We ordered the street corn....it was not hot, not spicy enough, and needed to be shucked for sharing.  Patio is pleasant.  Service was not as fast as we have experienced in the past.  Tacos and pickled onions on the side are what they do best; stick with these and a beer."}
{"text":"Never fails to satisfy. My boyfriend and I have been here several times. We come here when we're craving chips, salsa, and tacos. Such a cute location and they have seating outside which makes it a perfect setting for date night or just a chill night with friends. Everything we have slowly progressed to trying on each visit hasn't failed us. It all is so good. Definitely worth the stop in!"}
{"text":"I love Diego Pops, such an awesome and welcome addition to Old Town Scottsdale. It has good food, a fun and whimsical atmosphere without the attitude. 

Food has always been pretty stellar, not mind blowing but pretty flippin awesome! Think your usual small joint taco fare with a few additions that take it over the top... think fresh poke bowls and honestly no visit is really complete without an order of their in my own opinion famous Brussels sprout nachos; yes I just said what you think I did, and seriously I get what is going through your mind but somehow they make brussels sprouts and nachos work. No joke, these are not your mothers Brussels sprouts doused in nasty cheese. Just try them and you can send me a thank you card later. 

So go.... go on Margarita Mondays, Taco Tuesday, Wasted Wednesday, Tequila Thursdays you get my drift, any night is a good night for Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Sunday afternoon Happy Hour here at Diego Pops. The server was friendly. The happy hour menu including house margaritas was our favorite. Yes, I tried the Brussel Sprouts Nachos, and it was good, minus the Brussel sprouts, LOL LOL. The guacamole, and queso was good as well. Check this place out, you will like it!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with my girlfriend. Aesthetic was charming, service decent, and the food *tasted* great. We both ordered the house burrito.

I'm now writing this review the next day from one of our bathrooms as my girlfriend is occupying the other one. Both of us with upset stomachs since waking up this morning and aggressive diarrhea. We're both pretty positive that the chicken in the burritos must have not been properly cooked.

Thanks for the food poisoning Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for happy hour in Old Town! Great deals on drinks and food. The decor is very cute and inviting. Not usually super crowded, but makes for quick and attentive service. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch after hiking Camelback.  The food was fantastic and a great way to end the afternoon! The salsa, guacamole, and queso were a great way to start. The tacos were all good too. The charred skirt steak and braised pineapple pork tacos were fabulous! The service was great and Corey was super friendly! Go Blue!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe....chips, salsa, guac worth the trip alone.  Great tacos & super efficient service."}
{"text":"Jessica is the best waitress, every single time I've been to Diego pops it has taking forever to get food. Jessica has been the most efficient waitress there yet."}
{"text":"The bartender was probably the rudest and most unfriendly person I've ever encountered in old town. She clearly hated her job and did not want to be there. For that reason alone, I'll never be back. The waitresses were super sweet and over apologetic for the wait times for the food and drinks. Thats what gave this place 3 stars (otherwise maybe a 1 star). The guac was just not good. The chips were stale and the tacos were decent. So many other options I can spend my hard earned money on."}
{"text":"Made their happy hour and the house margarita is amazing! Steve and Alec were at the bar and took great care of me and my party! Try the braised green chili taco and creamy pinto beans!"}
{"text":"Oh my. My favorite taco in Scottsdale. Stop by on Mondays for half off these incredible eats. Go for the Green chili chicken!"}
{"text":"The brussel sprout nachos are the boomb!!!   With the pink sauce.  Great hip place with great food!!"}
{"text":"super awesome Mexican place with an amazing vibe to go along with it."}
{"text":"Trendy Mexican fare. Stick with the basics like grilled skirt steak, quesadillas and guacamole. Interesting cocktail combinations. Nice outdoor patio dining."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch on the patio. My friend had the chicken bowl and I had the steak bowl. Very tasty, lots of flavor and pretty good size servings. The patio was amazing this time of year and everyone of the staff was pleasant and polite. 
Our server was on point without being to overbearing. They discounted my bill a little because they were out of something I ordered. Hey... I'll take that as a trade. Lol. 
Had a great time and thought the place had a very unique atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Taco Monday price performance; so dang good! Our waitress was super smart; she obviously study the menu and knows what the food tastes like. It was our first time here so we asked her a lot of questions. She made reconditions based on our crazy questions that really suited us. Yep, we are coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. I like the food and atmosphere, but the service is pretty rough and downright rude at times. On food and atmosphere I'd like to give them 4 stars, but on service 1-2 stars. I've been twice, the worst was the last time when we went with our friends well behaved children (6 and 9 year old). As far as I know children are allowed, but they made us feel unwelcomed. We had to wait for a table, no biggie, but the bartender was extremely rude to us, like staring at us while she spoke about us. Once seated the service was OK, but the waitress charged us for tacos that they made incorrectly for the kids (we asked for plain steak tacos, got them with everything). We were at the point we just wanted to get out of there so didn't even say anything. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, mostly the rude service, which I see from other reviewers they have also experienced. 50/50 on if we would ever go back."}
{"text":"Food & service was excellent. Salsa was fresh and spicy, guac was great. I only had 2 tacos but would have loved to eat more. The shrimp was fantastic, there were different levels of flavor. I added some chipotle mayo hot sauce on it. Steak taco was great as well. The atmosphere was very relaxed, great bar area & outdoor dining. Margaritas were good & great Mexican beer selection on tap!"}
{"text":"Customer service is awful! The two bar Tenders were horrible. I'm not sure they are aware customer service is part of there job. They acted irritated that they had to talk to people. We actually had to get there attention. There was 2 bartenders and a total of 4 people (including 2 of us) at the bar. The other guest had to grab a dish towel off of the bar to wipe his hands. I definitely expected much more considering all of the competition around."}
{"text":"Great prices, great service,(Lexie was very helpful and friendly and prompt) fun atmosphere and VERY reasonable."}
{"text":"You can pretty much get tacos anywhere in the valley but the tacos here stand out!  The Brussel Sprout Nachos are the most unique item on the menu. I would have never expected this combo to be so good, but I actually have CRAVINGS for this dish and it's now my staple to order every time we go. When we have family and friends come from  out of town, this is one of our favorite spots to take them. The environment is inviting and comfortable which can be tough to find in old town Scottsdale. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do."}
{"text":"I go to Diego Pops all the time (the manager, Corey, said better to come here too much than to Taco Bell..truuu). I wouldn't come here that often if it wasn't amazing. The food is sooo good, they won a ton of awards at the Taco Festival so that's not just my opinion. I always get the street corn queso, it's basically liquid gold. They have a great choice of different tacos and bowls, they just added burritos to the menu too. Their drink menu is fantastic, and they just added pitchers of margaritas and beer (holler). They also have a really cool dessert menu, I tried the churro fries once and they're as good as they sound. 
Everyone that works there is really nice and the service is always on point. The bartender with the bow tattoos is so nice (I suck for always forgetting her name) and Taylor is a great server, she's nice and really attentive. Any time I've ever had an issue they've always taken care of it right away! I had a weird reaction to a drink once so they brought me out a different one and comped it for me. Sooo nice of them. Basically, you should just try this place, it's really good and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Wow I really hate to write bad reviews- but this restaurant deserves it!!! Rebecca the bartender was so rude to my service dog, boyfriend and Me. She shook her head at me in disapproval saying we can't allow your dog here. When I tried explain that we had already been over this before with the other manager she shook her head and said nope that was only one time. She is discriminating against me. It's illegal to deny us to eat there cause our service animal. It's called the \"Delta Law\" and it protects owners w service animals, and yes it's a fine to discriminate. I am so disappointed cause of love their nachos! Needless to say it left a bad taste in my mouth!

Ada.gov we will be filing a report."}
{"text":"Great tacos, marginal rice, bad service, world's worst margarita. It took about ten minutes to get chips and salsa. No sauces were served even though all other tables had them. Margarita was sickening sweet."}
{"text":"I was visiting some friends in town. Now I come from Chicago where we are known for some seriously good food. The wait staff was prompt, pleasant, and efficient. The decor was super cool. The menu had just enough things to choose from. The brussel sprout nachos were amazing and plated very nicely! I had a coconut flavored margarita that was so good I had to order another. The music was fun and they have a cool bar area that extends to the outside portion of the space. Overall I would go here again. It was a great place to go on a Friday night with some local friends."}
{"text":"Always a great spot for HH!! Friendly staff and good food. I recommend the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ALL AROUND PERFECT. Where to begin... They have the BEST happy hour in the state of Arizona. From 3 - 6 p.m. (7 DAYS A WEEK!) you can get half off apps, $5 wine + sangria, $4 house margaritas, and $3 beers. Not to mention their Taco Monday special, or all day happy hour Sunday! These people are killin' the game. The vibes are so cute - you'll never want to leave, and staff is so friendly and fun! If you can't tell, I'm just very passionate about this place (lol).

The most recent time I came here, my friend and I split THE FAMOUS nachos, a quesadilla, and their mango habanero wings. Everything has such a unique flavor! Especially when you top your food with their selection of special sauces. The roasted garlic beet one (pink) tops a few of their their dishes, and is my absolute favorite! 

The nachos are simply a must try. Like, you have to get these!!! My friend had the brilliant idea of adding BBQ chicken to our quesadilla and I'm so glad that we did. It was 10/10 amazing. I'll be getting this every time from now on. As for the mango habanero wings, they weren't for me. They definitely weren't bad, but I'm not a mango person, and I don't really like things with a kick to them! If you like sweet + spicy things, you'll love them! 

To sum up my most enthusiastic review of all time, COME HERE. You will be hooked on their good prices, good food, good portions!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, amazing atmosphere, great food. Perfect girls night out place in Old Town. Stephen was such a great server (stephen sparks? :-)) !"}
{"text":"Been here for 18 min and still don't have water or drinks. Took them 5 min to even greet us and take order. The floor is really dirty with physical debris present. There is plenty of staff hanging around and conversing with each other vs cleaning or serving customers amd there are only a few tables present.  Food was good though."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite shrimp taco! Taylor and Brian gave awesome service! The Margarita Snow cone is so cute and delicious. We had ceviche which was really good. I wish I had ordered fried plantains to go with it I think that would've been awesome so I'll have to come back and try it."}
{"text":"The food/margaritas were delicious. But that's about it. The staff is absolutely horrible. I would call out the waitress for being so rude, but I don't even know her name because she didn't even greet us. Seriously, she walked over to our table and set down menus and water and walked away. No hello! I wasn't sure if she was even our waitress. But lo and behold she came back and asked us for our order several minutes later. I would've thought maybe she was a bad egg, but all the staff was the same. No greetings and no smiles. I had a similar experience a couple months ago and ended up walking out because of how horrible the service was. Really disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place!! Tip to owner: fire and hire."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they never disappoint. Tried the sweet corn and avocado Caesar salad with shrimp this time and it was delicious. We sat up at the bar with a street view and had exceptional service from Steve the bartender.  I definitely recommend coming here for lunch or late night just before heading out to the bars in downtown."}
{"text":"I said it four months ago and I will say it again, when is this place gonna close down? I don't think they will be around next season!!"}
{"text":"Great patio and flavorful food. We went on a Monday for happy hour and $3 tacos on Monday's. $4 margaritas and 1/2 off appetizers. Great deal if you go on Mondays. Tacos are small but flavorful, worth $3 but definitely not worth full price. I had the Crispy Cod (left) Beef Machaca (middle) and Green Chili Chicken (right). They have a ton of great sauces on the table as well, those were fun to try. We also had the Brussels Sprout nachos which were a fun twist on traditional nachos. The egg on top was great"}
{"text":"Diego Pops is such an interestingly cute spot! Delicious food, drinks, and great service. I love the vibe here."}
{"text":"Great Brussel Sprout Nachos and Mediocre Tacos. Love the choco taco! Will return again"}
{"text":"Cutest place in the world so that why it gets 3 stars! I drug all my friends here and we were all so impressed with how adorable and well decorated this place was. Amazing ambience.

The food was very mediocre, I only liked 1 of my 3 tacos. (They were supposed to be award winning tacos and they won no awards in my book, I couldn't even eat the other two) The margs were also not the greatest. They tasted like store bought mix. 

Service was decent but the best thing consume was the chips gauc and salsa"}
{"text":"Diego pops is quaint and trendy at the same time. The building itself has a lot of fun decorations and reminds me of a bar in Mexico with a fun mixture of pop art and neon signs. The food was great. I loved the green chili chicken taco- Crispy  I also had the charred skirt steak which was also good. I rated this place 3 stars however for the service. We asked to be moved outside as soon as a spot opened and she ignored us for a long time on a slow day. I asked for the guava coconut drink and our waitress said they were out of coconuts as I proceeded to watch a girl at the next table receive a drink out of a coconut. I had to ask for my water to be refilled. They were also out of a lot of drink items. I would have rated this place 5 stars if the service wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"Really delicious and for a great price. I had the grilled shrimp bowl and the serving size was huge! Salsa has a kick and everything is fresh and not greasy. I left feeling satisfied. Also-they have a great happy hour and tacos are $2 on Mondays

--update--
Man I still love this place. 

Happy hour is 3pm-6pm and they're cocktails are killer. There are two snow cone margaritas to choose from: watermelon lime or mango elderflower. Save room for dessert! Along with their cocktails they have a great dessert menu which includes ice cream you can have dipped in fruity pebbles."}
{"text":"I will have cravings for their Brussel sprout nachos and go there solely for that reason. Cute spot with great photo ops with friends (pineapple wall paper, quaint patio, and a marquee that always says funny stuff). Great place for happy hour too!"}
{"text":"From the Diego Margarita to the green chili tacos I love this place! Great vibe on the patio especially during happy hour. 

Such a great vibe and cool spot. Love that they turned what was an awkward building, into such a chill and miami-esque environment!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 3 1/2 stars I would. The atmosphere is cool and they have a good patio. Also nice they have a small parking lot which is convenient as parking in that area can be painful sometimes. 

The brussel sprout nachos are amazing  and they really are a must order. I love all the sauces that they bring you as well. We've tried a few types of the tacos and haven't been impressed yet. The pork one was way too sweet and I couldn't even eat it. I also found the salmon one to be overcooked and blah. 

I've only been twice now so maybe they'll get better. I do plan to go back as I do see potential in this place."}
{"text":"I only ever go here for the Brussel sprout nachos which as phenomenal! One of my top 3 favorite nachos I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We asked a random couple on the street for a kid and dog friendly recommendation - and Diego Pops delivered.  Plenty of outdoor seating and good tacos at reasonable prices.  The service was not great (appeared not want to take our order, forgot to bring water for dog, didn't quite understand how to serve with kids at table/ not put glasses of water in front of grabby infant), and they only have 1-2 high chairs for the entire restaurant.

Very relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere.   Food was good, but could have used something to punch it up a bit."}
{"text":"Queso and salsa great. Burritos were straight mush. Service was great when the food was sub par."}
{"text":"I just had the best experience of my life in Hispanic dining and it was at Diego pops. Who would have thought. If I may, the service was beyond anything I have ever received in my life. Emily was not only our waitress but what felt like, my friend. She was very sweet and had s subtle confidence about her that made every decision we made flawless. Emily made us feel like family and on Cinco de Mayo, I couldn't ask for more. Hats off to delicious food, upbeat attitude and above all else, Emily. I hope she gets a raise. Star player!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try.  The hostess told us they were dog friendly, so we grabbed the pups and came back.  Turns out she lied.  Hopefully the staff learns what they are and aren't so guests can plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I love this place, we first tried it on Christmas Eve and of coarse we ordered the Brussels sprout nachos. Half off appetizer during happy hour (3-6pm). The nachos were AMAZING! It's got corn, oaxaca cheese, roasted brussels sprouts, pickled onion, chili, pink sauce (roasted garlic beet crema) & fried egg. My boyfriend and I also ordered the steak bowl with creamy pinto beans. It was good! the combination of the house coleslaw adds crunchiness and the grilled onion compliments the steak! I came back to celebrate my birthday with my classmate and we ordered tacos and the brussels sprout nachos. I was not a big fan of their tacos. I got the shrimp taco, braised pineapple pork and the adobo bbq chicken. The only taco I liked was the shrimp taco. The pork and the adobo chicken was alright. I want to try the crispy cod and plantain next time. My classmates enjoyed the brussels sprout nachos, they said they'll come back for more."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night with my boyfriend because they do $3 tacos on Monday's rather than Tuesdays like most places (awesome). We were seated right away at a table on the patio. Our server was quick and helpful through the whole dining experience. We each got an assortment of tacos, a house margarita, and the corn and queso dip - everything was amazing!! Hey even bring a container of 7 different sauces for you to put on everything. We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This spot was recommended to us by one of the ubiquitous golf cart drivers (she was young and cool...we were once cool too..but I digress). We sat at the bar and each had a margarita with housemade guac and salsa. Very nice the restaurant played great music, and it was nice to relax in the patio area with our drinks."}
{"text":"Being Hispanic makes you weary of any restaurant that serves Mexican food, but Diego Pops served up a plate full of deliciousness! 
I ordered the green chili taco, steak taco, bacon poblano street corn and a pitcher of sangria (to share with a friend). Everything was good except I wish the corn had more cheese and mayo throughout the entire corn. 

The restaurant is super cute and I am a little obsessed with all of the decor. They even brought the cuteness to the bathroom with quotes that read \"Hola Bonita\" I will be going back again to try more options on the menu. Brownie point or should I say Pan Dulce points for staying open late!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with this little place. I imagine the porch would be really nice during cooler weather also. I had a skirt steak bowl. I was a little weary ordering it because typically when I order steak, it's tough to chew. But this was melt in your mouth pieces and very delicious. The brown rice that was coming with it also caused me hesitation but I turned out loving it! Just really good food. It's a trendy little place.  Order their salsa and chips also. You won't regret it and that's coming from a salsa snob."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! ! !

I have been dining at Diego Pops in Old Town Scottsdale for a few years now, and they have never unsatisfied me! 

The food is absolutely to die for; with all of the crazy concoctions they produce. I don't think there is one food item I have tried on their menu that did not satisfy. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is so amazing. As you walk in, there is a light up board that changes every so often. Throughout the restaurant there are various pieces of art, colorful walls, and neon signs. Music taste is AMAZING! We asked the server for the playlist, and haven't stopped listening to it since! 

Prices are reasonable, for a dine-in restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. Would highly recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"What a fun little place. Stopped in during a bike ride for water, snacks and a margarita or 3. Place was happening! All enjoyed the food, drinks were good, staff great. Wew will be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite place in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale! Dare to order the brussel sprouts nachos -- insane combo with a fried egg on top! Creative food and great service. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. I recommend the crispy cod tacos. I come here all the time for lunch and sitting out on the patio is the best. Service is always great and the drinks are COLD!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite good, if a little bit odd. It's not your typical Mexican place. The nachos with Brussels sprouts and a egg over easy, captures their creativity and whimsy. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and the prices are very reasonable for downtown Scottsdale. They have a cute interior and I am sure it even better atomsphere at night. If you have choice between chipotle or here come to this hip spot. I came in to place an order and their manager was super nice. He let me go home with one each sauce.

I had their Brussels sprout nachos, shrimp taco and the guac and chips.
The best vegetarian nachos ever!! Loaded with perfectly roasted Brussels sprout, corn, melty cheese. Topped with an egg!!! Delicious!! The shrimp taco was loaded with fresh corn salsa and moist shrimp. The best sauces were salsa verde and avocado purée. The were both on the milder side. But the other sauce were just as good, but too hot for my whimpy taste buds. Everything is great except for one down fall, what kind of Mexican restaurant does not have a side order of guac for their tacos and nachos! You guys could easily make money selling a little side of guacamole. So I ordered the guacamole app because this California loves her avocados. The appetizer is a generous portion of guac. Will definitely be back soon and not just for a lunch order to go."}
{"text":"I really did want to like this place but...not much of a selection for vegetarian.  Menu is ok but could be better... the cilantro rice was way to bland.  We were there on a Sunday noon not many people and service was just ok, she never ask if we wanted anything to drink and it took her forever to bring back our appetizer.  So probably will not go back--Parking is awful."}
{"text":"Diego Pops is a great example of a smaller restaurant in Old Town that is worth the find! Definitely go for the corn queso for an appetizer, you can't go wrong with any of the tacos as well. The Poke was top notch. Lexie was great, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Cute, cute, cute!!! I love this place. Great vibes and even better decor. The happy hour food specials are amazing. I got a stuffed quesadilla for less than $4! The bartender was nice enough to make a virgin piña colada for me and it was served in a fresh coconut. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"I liked the funky modern atmosphere.  I sat outside, it was humid without misters but wasn't too bad. Only negative was the lighting - there wasn't enough. Other than that the patio was legit.

Service was good. Food was even better. Taco Monday?! Who knew this was a thing. Diego Pops originators of the taco Monday kick though! We ordered 1 of each their 7 tacos featured (plenty more to select from) these were the $2 or $3 deal. Favorite was the cod, salmon, green chili chicken. 

They have a killer selection of sauces/salsas they bring out too which only adds to your dish! Chips and salsa were on point, salsa was chunky and had a good kick.

Best part... CHOCO TACO!

definitely a spot to go check out."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this restaurant/bar after flying all day.  Bartender (I believe her name was Rebecca) gave us spectacular service.  She recommended a few local beers for us to try after asking us questions about different preferences - She was spot on with her recommendation.  We ordered a bunch of different tacos, all which were delicious.  After a few beers, a bunch of tacos and they threw in an order of chips/salsa our bill was less than $30.  We will be back next time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's family friendly, lively atmosphere, COMFORTABLE seating, and very yummy food!  Service was quick and attentive!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So all of you who know me, know that I am a food snob, and that soup is my favorite type of food. This place has the best chicken tortilla soup to date...hands down. The tacos are awesome as well. The atmosphere will bring you back or to a posh place here in scottsdale, San Diego, or LA.  Very nice and relaxing, kinda like a sushi establishment vibe.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best! It's a little expensive, so make sure you always know when happy hour is going on. The drinks are amazing and the food is even better. I've been at least 10 times and this place has always been consistently amazing!"}
{"text":"So, this place happened!!!  We started off with the brussel sprout nachos.  Then there are several sauces to try but my fave was the beet and garlic crema. It was drema!!  I had the mango chili pepper sno cone margarita.  Then had the garlic shrimp bowl.  All I can say is Wow!!  So fabulous!!  Our server Taylor was awesome!!  So get off the couch right now and go!!!"}
{"text":"This was a real find!  We came during happy hour and tried most of the appetizers.  The most fantastic, hands down, is the Tortilla soup.  The broth is so good, wishing I had the recipe.  Service was great, and you can't beat the flavors and the value.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"I've been here many many times because of the fun vibe, tasty food and funky decor. I always hesitate coming due to the POOR service! They are never attentive or seem to happy to be serving us. Tonight we waited 15 minutes for our server to great us. It was during happy hour and we weren't given a Happy Hour menu until 30 minutes after we arrived. It was a disaster. What happened to earning your tip? Very disappointed in the service and most likely won't be returning after this experience tonight."}
{"text":"Was looking for a great place for tacos and decided to try Diego's since the reviews were really good.  It was exactly what I was looking for. 
Reminded me of La Lupitas in Old Town San Jose.  Open air.  Good service and amazing flavors.  We had the green chili chicken, grilled shrimp, skirt steak and grilled salmon tacos.  Yum.  Heading back soon for the Poke......you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the guacamole which was basically just chunks of avocado and a sprinkle of cheese. Nothing fantastic about it. Drinks are way overpriced for what you get. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is because the tacos and burritos were yummy. Highly recommend the beef machaca tacos."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with a friend of mind after all the hype our friends had about this place.

Service was average at best. Our table didn't have any utensils and our waitress rarely checked on us so we had to get up and take utensils from another table. We saw our waitress 3 times while we were there for an hour so we'd be sitting forever to ask for something.

Our mango habanero wings came out with NO sauce on it, they were just fried wings. And the dressing that was supposed to come with it didn't. The waitress brought the food back but it still wasn't great and we were still charged for their mistake.

The tacos were average, I've definitely had better in old town. The shrim Taco was the only one I liked. However the Mexican mule was a highlight in a rather dismal putting where there was poor service and , below average food."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5 
Happiness 3/5

An interesting place that serves poke bowls and tacos. Needless to say, these tacos were not authentic. But what does it matter when they are SO delicious.

They start you off with some free chips and salsa. Make sure to also ask for their numerous other sauces and ailolis, which they provide gratis. I ordered the skirt steak, adobo chicken and salmon tacos, which I listed in order of deliciousness. Honestly, these tacos are so flavorful and well balanced that adding extra sauce is a mistake as it throws off the flavor profile. I enjoyed them as each bite was packed with flavor. 

The service was a tad slow, but the server was pleasant. 

I definitely would love to try a poke bowl (assuming I can get it without pineapple. DIE pineapple!) and a breakfast burrito looks delicious too. This is a nice, affordable spot full of tasty tacos in the midst of pricey spots in oldtown Scottsdale. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I had taken my employees to dinner here a couple years ago and the menu was unique and I was impressed so I suggested to a friend of mine that we meet for lunch here. We attempted to go at 330pm on a Saturday was turned away \"due to a large party\" coming in later. I understand special events and all but O really felt that they could have seated 2 in the middle of the afternoon. We took our money elsewhere and I probably will not ever attempt to return to Diego Pops"}
{"text":"What else can I say? The tacos are great! And the staff is super friendly. We always come and ask for Brittany; she is honestly the most personable waitress. She is always attentive and always makes sure we have everything we need. We love coming to get tacos here, mainly because of her! Tacos are great, especially with the deals on Monday! Margs are equally as great as their tacos and burrito bowls :)"}
{"text":"Great tacos, cold beer, friendly staff. I came for lunch, but need to come back to have drinks on the patio some evening. Good selection of cocktails too"}
{"text":"Brought some friends to Taco Monday/ Happy hour. The first timers will be long timers after their experience. We made it easy for Emily, but she did great. $4 Don Julio margs and $3 Diego Tacos, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Such a cute little hip taco place that is really close to old town Scottsdale. They weren't crazy busy but it took quite a while to get a table almost like there was no dedicated hostess. However it was Sunday which is all day Happy Hour! $5 margaritas and cheap tacos. The carne one was so good. But definitely get the Brussel sprout nachos. It sounds weird, but they are delicious, especially if you like sprouts."}
{"text":"After several visits to Diego Pops, I think I can solidly give a 4-star \"Yay! I'm a fan\" Yelp review.

Margaritas are always tasty, food is always great. Their selection of tacos is good, although as an ex-vegetarian of almost 11 years, I do wish they had one more veggie choice besides the plantain. I've also had a burrito for lunch once; it was huge and chock full of goodness. The green chili chicken can't be beat for a taco/burrito filling, and I also recommend the crispy cod (I'm not the hugest fish fan, but it is tasty-fried goodness.)

I LOVE the ambiance here. The inside wallpaper/lighting/decor is so cute and makes me want to deck out my house in trendy-Mexican-tropical-abode-chic. Pineapple print walls, anyone? The patio has a great fireplace to sit by, with tons of twinkly lights. 

Their sauce/salsa caddie is fun. If you order a chips and salsa appetizer, you can't beat a selection of house salsa, plus 6 (I think?!) extra choices!

All in all, a pretty glorious Old Town choice."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Friday at 11:30 am, wasn't packed or anything when I arrived.  Had 3 people with me.  We were seated immediately, offered drinks.  Jessica was our server.  She was pleasant, not super talkative, just pretty much all business, which is totally fine with me.  Larger tables are going to get less talking from the server.  Makes sense.  Ordered some appetizers, ceviche and guacamole, both excellent.  Jessica came back a little later to check on us and took our lunch orders.  Food came out, looked and tasted awesome.  Everyone had finished their food in about 10 minutes or so.  Table was bussed, dishes cleared and what not.   No Jessica.  10, 15, 20, 30 minutes later, no Jessica.  Where did she go?  Two of my guests had to go to another meeting so they left.  About 10 minutes later, Jessica appeared with the bill.  Weird right?  Usually, lunch time, you get in and you get out pretty close to when you finish eating.  3 stars for some slightly slow service, everything else was worth 5 stars.

I'll be back for sure, maybe Jessica had an off day.  Full disclosure, I don't believe in tipping under for bad service, not that Jessica's service was bad, was just very very slow.  Jessica still got 20% which is really my minimum.

I ended up leaving right after signing the bill roughly around 1:15 pm, again, arrived at 11:30 am finished eating around 12:15 pm."}
{"text":"The interior is very cute and unlike the rest of the reviews I have read, the service was great. We went in on a Sunday around lunch time and surprisingly there was hardly anyone there. We ordered the brussel sprout nachos which were highly recommended and I would say they were OK (I'm not a huge brussel sprout fan) but if you are, I would order them. They come with a selection of different salsas which I enjoyed.
We also ordered a few of the tacos: steak, green chili chicken and cod and they were not bad. I would order again. 
I would go back to try the drinks and some of the desserts which sounded delicious. 
My only complaint is that it seems as if they raised their prices without adjusting the menus as the pricing on our bill was different for each item than what was listed on the menu (which they let you use as a placemat so you could easily go back and compare the pricing). Not a huge deal but the server/manager didn't seem too thrilled to adjust the pricing on our bill to the menu price (which they didn't do it properly, they just knocked off $1 for \"inconvinence\")."}
{"text":"Taco Monday!  Can't understand why you would ever eat anywhere else on a Monday.  

Great tacos, very reasonable price.  Also had the \"must have\", very popular brussel sprout nachos ( a huge, very filling portion).  The cocktails were tasty too (though they were not a bargain).  

All in all I would certainly go back any day; and certainly on a Monday!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best tacos in Scottsdale.  The steak tacos served in a bowl or tortilla were awesome.  Good crowd there with valet parking available with excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant near the Old Town Scottsdale. I was staying in the heart of Old Town, and this was an easy walk (10 minutes) from my hotel (The Saguaro). I really liked the overall decor of this place, with really fun wall signs and a casual SoCal decor. Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the outside bar (patio).

For my meal, i ordered chips and salsa, the charred skirt steak taco, and a Tolum poke bowl. The chips and salsa were really good, and both tasted fresh.  I powered through these quickly. The taco was okay, and probably not something I would order again. The Poke bowl was delicious. On a hot day, it hit the spot.

The only real negative about this place was the service. They were slightly inattentive and I had to work hard to get their attention. Overall, this place is deserving of another visit."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and had to try it. It definitely is well worth it. Service was fast and great. Love the real coconut drinks. Taco's are great but I still like Sumomaya taco's"}
{"text":"Not sure if its me but the food out here just isn't tasty as the south..  Took my fiance out for dinner here and had the mango habanero wings and I'm going to say these were possibly the worst wings I've ever had.  It was if they were just deep fried with out any seasoning and dipped in some sauce and the chicken still had that raw taste.  The salmon taco and the queso tasted bland, not to mention we found not 1 but 2 hairs in the food.  1st impressions are important in my opinion so we probably won't ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Solid selection of tacos. Otherwise $2 for a 2 ounce portion of rice and beans? Pretty silly, but maybe that's old town."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service were all top notch! Had an amazing first experience. Staff was great and very attentive. Came for a friend's birthday and the owner went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. Will definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone looking for a relaxed, awesome taco and marg experience!!"}
{"text":"I had such a great dining experience at Diego Pops tonight 
Our server Cait was excellent 
She gave us a run-down of the menu and told us about the goodies
The entire menu was very intriguing and on this particular visit, I went with the Green Chili Chicken bowl... With the rice and \"refried\" beans option
For starters we had the chips and salsa and we also added on some guacamole... Omg they were soooo good... The salsa had a kick to it, which I love... And the guac was equally as tasty...
I had the sangria rojo and it complimented the meal very well... 
The bowl was pretty interesting when it arrived but once I started eating it, the favors were immense... 
I can't wait to go back to try the tacos and cocktails 
Such a good experience.. Will recommend to friends... 

Ps- parking is great at this location! Side and front lots available"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place.  I live in the neighborhood and am dying to have a go-to cheap, fun, Mexican restaurant...but this will not be it.  I love the atmosphere, especially on the patio.  I wish the taste of the food was as good.  

Overall, I found things to be underseasoned, and I am usually the one complaining about saltiness.  We started with the corn dip, which was alright but kind of ruined by the fact that it was lukewarm.  The chips were very fresh and crisp, though.  Then we had one of the poke dishes over rice--very bland.  If you want good poke, go a few blocks down to Hula's.  Then, I had a shrimp taco and a steak taco.  The steak had good flavor when I ate it alone, but the taco wasn't great.  Same with the shrimp taco.  I also taster my friend's pork entree.  He liked it, but, once again, I thought it was bland.  And, yes, I did try adding several of the different sauces that they provided, but I still wasn't crazy about anything.  

I would like to go back to have drinks on the patio, but I'll probably have dinner elsewhere.  Or maybe I'll try the Brussel sprout nachos, which I'm told are very tasty."}
{"text":"Had lunch there and the Skirt Steak Tacos were 5 star!  The steak was tender and flavorful.  I also can oddly say that the Brussel Sprout Nachos were outrageously good. Great selection of beer and great mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Food was really great. Service was so terrible I felt like I was being punked. Night of Fri Feb 17 at the bar was a mess to say the least"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Mexican spot in Scottsdale! The food was great and our server Anthony was better! He had great recommendations and was extremely friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was sooooo cute! Loved all of the cocktails and the Brussel sprout nachos were AMAZING! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Stumbled upon this place while on a date and fell in love. The drinks and food were amazing. Plantain tacos were like heaven and the tequila tasting was great!"}
{"text":"I am never coming back.

1. The first time I came in I asked for guacamole. The server brought us the chips and I asked my server if we can have salsa. She figured I was asking about the guac but she turned around and literally yelled that she is getting the guac. She later went to get a different server.

2. I decided to give it a second try. I asked for a vodka soda and she NEVER asked for what type of vodka. When I later checked I saw they charged me for titos.

Never coming back. Still have not had a good experience"}
{"text":"Diego Pops, is a modern tequila and taco lounge/ restaurant! I love it! It's not what you think it is coming from the outside but everything about the logo and what they are about is true! Neon, modern edgy and of course the decor inside is what made me love it more! The service was wonderful not too rushed and we probably came at the wrong time but that didn't stop me. I've been hearing about the Nachos, it's not just any nachos it's the Brussels sprout nachos! From the flavor to the cheese and to the ingredients everything is so outstanding in flavor! You see I never had a Brussels sprout but it's kinda like a more flavorful broccoli! I give it 2 thumbs up! They also have different sauces from chipotle mayo to a Serrano ranch! Tacos are outstanding but it's based on one, there's so much more j want to try! Cocktails and the specialty drinks are wonderful and different! Must try the coconut drink it comes in vodka and tequila! So if you are in the Scottsdale area give it a try stop by! By yourself or with you or friends!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I have loved it both times! The decor is super cool, the staff are super friendly and the drinks are delish! My fav. Is the Mexican Trail Mix Salad sooo yummy and the Brussel sprout nacho thing is out of this world crazy but ultra delicious- you have to try it! 

Parking is convenient! Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Loved the atmosphere. Sat outside and loved it. Service was a little quirky and on the slow side however we were In no rush so it didn't matter. Excellent fresh margaritas too!!"}
{"text":"We check out this place while vacationing. I'm from San Diego so I know good tacos when I taste one..They have amazing tacos!!

Food wise: we had Chips and salsa which were good.. Salas was on the spicy side but great flavor!
Crispy cod taco was on another level! Worth every bite.
Chicken tortilla soup, I cant think of a place that had a better tortilla soup. Chicken was tender.

Ambience wise: it's a hip location with decor that matches. They also had some decent football games on.

Service wise: excellent! The best we've had while on vacation.

Price wise: worth the price. Standardized pricing quality food too.

Overall: if I come back to Scottsdale, I'm coming back here.."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, went there and were delighted to find it was Taco Monday meaning  reasonable prices! The wife and I each tried 3 tacos and they were mostly great. The crunchy fish taco had one of the best flour tortillas I've had - very thin and crunchy, not soft and chewy like many flour tortillas (which can be great as well.) The interior was really cute and fun, and the agua frescos wasn't overly sweetened. The music was a bit loud for lunchtime, but at least the song selection was good!"}
{"text":"Food was DELISH!! Everything we got was amazing. Brussel Sprout Nachos come highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really solid spot for drinks and dinner on a Friday night in Scottsdale. We didn't make reservations so the wait for a table was a bit long (40minutes) but we were able to grab two seats at the bar right away. Drinks were well priced with pitchers of margaritas and beer for $17. The Brussel sprout nachos are a must try and the quesadillas are also very solid. Make sure to get the hot sauce rack - 6 different flavorful sauces - habero has a real kick."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos ($2 on Mondays!), fun decor (pineapple wallpaper, neon, b/w cowboy movies playing), and good vibes. Was out of our way but worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Cute spot, great energy, fantastic service. Started with the Brussel Sprout Nachos, expecting a healthy version of nachos where the chips were replaced with Brussel Sprouts but what we got was a pile of chips topped with all kinds of delish and perfectly charred sprouts. So, today is a cheat day and I am not sorry, nope...not one bit! I managed to eat my steak taco and that was equally incredible."}
{"text":"The street corn was great, watermelon mint blossom margarita was great but the service was so bad we talked about it after being home. It was busy but not packed and every single table around us remained dirty the entirety of our stay. Occasionally someone would come over and grab a couple things but food remained on 3 tables and un wiped our whole stay which is just odd for a place charging $10-$14 for a margarita. There were several times we didn't see our server for 15 minutes. It was one of those experiences where you want to order more but end up having to leave because it doesn't seem like anyone is around to actually help you get anything you want to have. She walked by a few times but didn't even look at us and when she did it was a look of like oh yeah you're still here it was terrible. The food tastes good but if it's a hassle that I'm there I don't have to be."}
{"text":"Great service and decent tacos. This isn't the most amazing southwestern Mexican I've had but it's decent and the decor is super funked out. The crispy cod tacos were good and the margarita was tasty - a bit pricey for the quality"}
{"text":"Great customer service. They really take care of their guests! It has been a while since I have been treated like a real customer!"}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere!
Fantastic food with lots of variety and interesting flavors. Coconut rice, brussel sprout nachos, and yummy sauces to spice up your meal are just a few of my favorites at this place. The drinks are excellent as well. 
A great addition to old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"It's very rare these days to find a restaurant that's an all around gem. The food, service and atmosphere were all on point!! You MUST try the Brussels sprout nachos!  The chips and salsa are to die for and the sauces you get with your meal are never ending!! Give this place a try! You will fall in love with it instantly!"}
{"text":"Vibe was too much of a show and a scene. 
Plantain taco was okay, but the coconut ceviche was cloyingly sweet. Maybe some people like that way but not me. 
If you're looking for a Miami-like place with so-so food, this place is the spot."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had the Cali burrito. It was really good. The steak inside of it wasn't my fav so I'll try it with chicken next time. Ask for the carrier of sauces. They are really good. The house salad dressing was too sweet/they put too much of it on the salad. I didn't like the fresh margarita with cucumber, a bit too sweet."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for a drink and tacos. The bar is cool and great people watching. Service was awesome ask for Brittany !!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If there's one word to describe Diego Pops....it would be...FUN! It feels like a laid back surfer hang-out spot with great indoor-outdoor seating. 

We started the the mango jalapeño wings. They had a spicy aftertaste but I felt like the overall lacked a substantial amount of flavor and didn't quite live up to my expectations. They were also a little pale in color which made them appear a little less appetizing. 

My husband ordered he beef machacha tacos on a corn tortilla. They were delicious. Both fresh and savory. The side of coconut rice was a little dry and needed more flavor.

My trail mix salad with green chili chicken was delicious. It was robust with flavor, and hearty enough to satisfy even those weary about salads.

Service was as bright and friendly as the ambiance of the establishment. I can see why so many people rave about Diego Pops!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked by all the good reviews that I have seen for Diego Pops.  My first visit did not meet what others have experienced.  I visited this place on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have to say the patio bar is awesome....  The food and drinks however, are not!  Weak drinks, soup came out cold, tacos were average and service at the bar was poor.  Definitely would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food, fun drinks, good specials.  Expensive otherwise.  Brussel sprout nachos, tacos, and elote dip.  Top notch."}
{"text":"Tacos are great, tunes are just right. It's one of my regular spots. Chips and salsa are on point. Guac won't disappoint. Outdoor patio is always popular. Great spot for yourself or even better for a group. Pineapple pork and BBQ chicken tacos are my go to. 
Always delicious and great service."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed with my first dining experience in AZ.  

There is outdoor and indoor dining, and bars, available. There is a nice fireplace outdoors with seating around it as well.  It was a little chilly when we were here, but they had heat lamps available.  They did offer to move them closer to us, but someone had already beat us to the request.  

My friend brought me to Diego Pops for tacos, but we started with the fabuloso brussel sprout nachos.  I was so mesmerized that I forgot to snap a quick photo! I appreciated that the menu indicated the customer favorites, as well as the award winning items.  I had endulged so much of the nachos that I ordered just one taco, the chili verde chicken.  I was quite pleased with my order.  The blend of flavors was exciting and I would absolutely go back for more.

They do have an array of fun mixed drinks.  We ordered something that came in a large coconut.  I would say it wasn't worth the $13, however.  (There is a full bar available.)  

I would put Diego Pops on your 'to do' list."}
{"text":"First time coming here and wanted to try it out because it always look poping.The atmosphere was awesome! Food was way over priced the tacos were $3+ for tiny tiny taco. With that high priced I expect a flavorful dish. Excited to get the grilled salmon taco. The salmon tasted like it came from a can . ordered pitcher of margarita . it was 60% water 35% juice 5% alcohol for $35. Prolly never coming back. Maybe it it was like $2 a taco. Service was good nothing outstanding .I like how they have a variety of sauces on the table."}
{"text":"This place gets me excited for Monday's. Taco Monday's are a must. Love the shrimp and bbq taco. Chips and salsa is good to! Beer selection is solid. The service is great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Was seated immediately. I ordered two tacos and a side of the coco rice. The steak taco was a little tough but not that tough. Nice flavor and served on white corn soft tortilla. I was really impressed by the green chili taco  lots of layered flavors.  I would order this one without hesitation. Although, I walked here, it appears that parking may be an issue when the next door neighboring restaurant re-opens.   All in all, a great new casual dining spot in Old Town."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Diego Pops and I'm now craving it everyday. The happy hour here is incredible! You must enjoy a margarita with Brussels Sprout Nachos and add green chili chicken to it. WOW. I also LOVE the pineapple pork bowl and taco. Everything is a must here and I'm excited to come back more."}
{"text":"It's a nice little spot in Old Town with decent food, and just okay service. The Sonoran hotdog and cheese dip are my favorites. The service is not desirable. It took 20 minutes to get our change back when the restaurant only had five tables filled. They have a nice patio with some shade which is great during the winter."}
{"text":"The decor of the place is super cute. I enjoyed the neon lights, quirky decor and the night life atmosphere that it created. Came here with a coworker for drinks after a long day and the margaritas did not disappoint. We each got our own tacos but the true VIP of the meal was the True Corn + Avocado Caesar w/ Chicken salad. It was creamy deliciousness! Our own server seemed M.I.A. at times but it seemed like they worked as a team because there was always some one to help us get something."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Diego Pops! They have a great happy hour, good tacos and quesadillas, and their drinks are awesome! The menu is small but good, and this is just a fun place in general. I live right down the street and this will be a frequent stop for me!"}
{"text":"Such an adorable lunch spot. We had the award winning guacamole, salsa, Tulum bowl, and the adobo BBQ chicken tacos. My husband no i loved everything about it. I'm only bummed that I can only find these cute restaurants in Scottsdale and not in the west valley."}
{"text":"No, no no.  Guess I am just high maintenance!  More of A Mission kinda girl.  Watered down marg without enough ice, hot and sweaty, loud place.  Reminded me of Hooters - servers with over sized boobs bigger than there heads. Def not a place for foodies!

I guess it is more of a college hang out.  Not for me.  Food was a mess, even a set of large breast can't make up for that!"}
{"text":"Ok AMAZING food and drinks but that was some of the worst service I've ever had. It took us 20 minutes to get chips and salsa... Even with that said I still would go back for those tacos over and over again. The watermelon mint margarita is so yummy but small for then price."}
{"text":"One of best place to eat and enjoy in old Town Scottsdale. Tocos are fresh and best. Not much options for vegitarian."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for causal outdoor drinks and food. Food and drinks exceeded expectations, great service. The mango habanero wings have an amazing spice and less mango taste then I expected, which I loved! Watermelon margarita with mint was one of the best margaritas I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was mind blown by the shrimp bowl! Love the sauce caddy that you have on the table. Service was also great and very attentive. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Loved the casual and relaxed atmosphere here. The food was really fresh and very well made. Waiter was really laid back and knew his menu and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great service. Anthony was awesome! Michalada bombs are the best drink"}
{"text":"Great HH!

The food was all really good! 

The unique vibe of the place is perfect of an after work get together. Lots of space with a nice patio."}
{"text":"First stop once we arrived in Phoenix was Deigo Pops. I'm pretty sure it was the Brussel Sprout nachos that caught my attention when I bookmarked this place. Outstanding. We also order 3 different kind of tacos, all were very very good. One bowl, which was huge and very substantial and the Ceviche which I absolutely loved with coconut and shrimp. We also enjoyed the outdoor dining. Something we take advantage of every time we come to Phoenix. 
Great beer choices and cocktails as well. We are already talking about going back before we leave town."}
{"text":"Best Mexican street corn every and everything else! Bar staff, Michael and Nate, is nice and friendly! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Mexican food and unfortunately all other places we researched were booked up.  Diego Pops was OK.  The crispy pineapple pork taco was the best but the other items we ordered were just OK.  Cool location but the staff seemed somewhat unenthusiastic."}
{"text":"Stockton hair real quick for a quick Taco really nice atmosphere. Great service. I got it served us was Fox. Very good place very good service box did a great job as a bartender very knowledgeable of this place you have a few minutes stopping for a taco and a beer"}
{"text":"My company ordered food from here and it was just sad. One bowl had very little rice and the fruit was way to hard to eat. Another bowl was short of rice. I just think if one is paying $13 a bowl it shouldn't come poorly made. Called back and tired to explain and only thing was said was I'll talk to my cooks. Never once asked if we would like it remade or anything. Plus the guy said, no their is no manager here today. Very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This place is adorable, and the margaritas and food were good. The Brussel sprout nachos were good even though I was super skeptical."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite taco place ever. If you have never been here you are missing out! The corn queso dip is a must and the braised green chili chicken taco is just as amazing!! Every time I go there the service is awesome and I love that the owner is very personable! Give it a try or ten, you wont be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Fun, fresh food, and great service.  Love sitting outside on the patio with the lights, the firepit and awesome music.  Tacos are awesome, guacamole and ceviche are yummy, although chips and salsa are underwhelming.  Great place to bring out of town guests to eat outside in January, and gloat about life in the desert."}
{"text":"Fun, hip and trendy little Taco shop with a limited, yet unique menu. Enjoyed some later evening eats here as our first stop at another nearby restaurant was disappointing. 

The crunchy green chile chicken taco was tasty - the crunch was perfection. Unfortunately our food wasn't hot and normally we'd send it back if that's the case, but we were quite hungry by the time we visited. 

The Plantains are \"Platanos\" (the sweet fried kind to those who aren't familiar). We'd wished they were \"Tostones\" since we prefer the savory, crunchy unripened plantain.

The margaritas were good. I really enjoyed trying each of the 6 sauces they offer to customize your taco. They all were great and some unique (like the Beet Crema - mild yet flavorful - delish!). I'll admit the sauces were probably my favorite part of the experience. If our food was hot, the tacos would have been the star.

Pleasant, friendly staff. We dined at the bar."}
{"text":"You can't come here with out getting the Brussel sprout nachos! The decor is very chic mexican mixed with ritzy scottsdale. 

I usually order a few tacos and my favorite thing about diego pops is the carousel of sauces they bring out for you. I docked one star for slow service."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Atmosphere was great. The server Jessica was awesome. I would definitely come back. Hit the place for happy hour and the discounts on the tacos."}
{"text":"New fav! Loved everything that we ordered! Amazing salsa and guac. Ceviche was fresh and delicious. Also tried the chicken quesadilla and the Mexican trail mix salad. Loved it all! Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I really like the layout and decor of this place. The patio is great, we always sit at the bar and enjoy Happy Hour, where the house margaritas are great and only $5. 
The quesadilla is yummy, however the ceviche lacks the tartness of a traditional, but still tastes good with a cucumber cream sauce. I really don't know about the extended menu, but it looks good. We just want to eat cheaply, so we end up around 50 bucks including food and 3 drinks each!! This is elevated Baja cuisine, not Sonoran Mexican food. But it's good in a casual fun way."}
{"text":"Wow! We found this great place on the door dash list.  Looked it up on Yelp and decided to have it delivered tonight.  We have a new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!  I had the Crispy cod bowl with coconut rice, pickled onions and some hot chipotle sauce.  I loved the slaw and how the whole bowl just made sense.  I can't wait to try others!!!  

We also ordered a steak taco which the meat was done tenderly and seasoned perfectly. The shell stood up to the filling and didn't fall apart in your hands.  It was great!!  We also tried a pork and pineapple burrito.  First thing is the delicious flour tortilla.... WOW! It also stood up to all the beans and rice and mouth watering pineapple with tender pieces of pork. It's a big burrito!!  We would definetly order it again.  The chips .... just crispy and wonderful!!!  We were seriously impressed right down to their to go ware.  Very nice.  Can't wait to order this again!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered the ceviche which we liked. It was unusual with coconut, served in a coconut. It was $13, not bad, but since it was a little bland, we asked for a side of salsa. Also kind of bland, but okay. Our surprise was the $2 charge on our bill for the salsa. It's a Mexican restaurant. Really? The house margarita was mediocre at best. The beer was really good and cold. Service was fine."}
{"text":"This place is a nice Trendy Tex Mex place in the heart of scottsdale. They have many creative dishes and a fun atmosphere. It can be very loud in there, but not to bad. It is priced fine and is overall a great place. I Recommend it."}
{"text":"Visiting from Illinois with my wife. Hands down best tacos of my life. Also Monday's just so happen to be half off the tacos. I recommend to everyone! I had the charred steak, braised green chile chicken, and braised pineapple pork. My wife had the poke tuna and said it was very fresh, light, and delicious. Wish they had this restaurant in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best taco place in AZ!! Every single time I go in, I always get the best service. Staff is always accommodating. Great specials on food and drinks. Cannot say enough good things about this place. This is the place for you if you are wanting to get A+ treatment!"}
{"text":"Prejudice?...Could have even been considered racist!!!
We showed up with my family for dinner, a party of 13 on Saturday at 5:30pm, just ahead of us were also two large parties as well, one of 12 and the other of 9. When it was our turn to be seated, the seating hostess was incredibly rude, unaccommodating and basically told me that they were not the kind a restaurant that could seat large parties!  So I asked if we could split our party and sit in two groups, and the seating hostess aside from being rude was very reluctant to figure out how to get our party seated. The restaurant was as usual very busy at that time, but there were clearly a few open tables! Since she just stood there as she silently stared at me, I asked her if she was basically asking me to leave, and she proceeded to tell me that \"if it were her, she would want to be seated with all her family.\" In other words, the answer was \"yes\"  We have lived in Arizona for thirty years now, and this is sadly the third time I've been treated in such a despicable manner. Perhaps, it was because we didn't fit the profile \"look\" in order to eat at Diego Pops, perhaps it was because I had brought my parents and my 94 year old aunt and cousin who were visiting from out of the country. Either way, this was a terrible experience and it's very unfortunate this restaurant gave off such an  unwelcoming, snobbish and even prejudice vibe (due to race, age, maturity?) The employee working as the seating hostess should NOT be your front of the house person! Although the food was good, I'm not sure it could ever make up for making someone feel so unwelcome and treated so unkindly!"}
{"text":"Everything was great from the upbeat music, food and service. Taco Monday is a fantastic way to try what they offer. Must try other items with a organic margaritas.  Yum! Thank you Corey for the Brussel Sprout Nachos."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and the patio. The happy hour margaritas are always on point. I normally sit outside on the patio, they have great misters and big shade umbrellas. Last time I went I got the steak bowl with brown rice and with the salsa that comes with the chip and salsa app made a perfect fit. Even when I've been here with a large group (8+) the service was AWESOME. Will be returning! :)"}
{"text":"A Miami vibe in Old Town Scottsdale. 

Brussels Sprout nachos could be a meal for 1 OR sharing between 2; definitely not for a party more than that.  

Chia lemonade could use more chia seeds. 

Watermelon + Cotija salad is refreshing, and can be easily paired with any of their tacos. Tho their Braised Pineapple Pork indicates crispy tortilla, I preferred it on flour; unless you're eating it as soon as it comes out, it gets much too hard. Then you can drown it in sauce. 

Take advantage of their 6-pack of sauces- Roasted Garlic Beat Crema was my fave. 

Minus a star because their dessert was a bust. 
Choco taco was store bought but priced as if  handmade. I can get this from the ice cream man and at half the price. 
Hand dipped cone isn't dipped at all. The hardening chocolate sauce is drizzled over the ice cream. Churro sundae was more ice cream than churro; and the churro spears were more like pretzels after you dug it out."}
{"text":"Brussel Sprouts Nachos - surprisingly delicious.  A must have.  Great service, interesting atmosphere, but a really unique and good menu."}
{"text":"So happy we stopped here for our last meal before our red-eye flight home! The vibes are awesome and the food was delicious (as well as the drinks...of course!)! We sat outside at the bar (string light ambiance always wins me over), and our bartender was very nice, as well as helpful (we had a hard time deciding what to order since everything sounded so good, so she took the time to show us the way). Highly recommend the Sweet Corn and Avacado Ceaser Salad w/ steak + the Watermelon Mint Margarita. Without question, you need the guac, too, because guac is life. Can't wait to go back one day!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Get 5 and especially try the green chili chicken! Alec gave incredible service. Cool dude. Definitely coming back. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"such a cute place to go for brunch or dinner! they have an awesome healthy Mexican menu! food is delish!!! you can sit inside or out the place is just too cute! service and atmosphere is very welcoming! I will definitely be eating here very often!"}
{"text":"The brussel sprout nachos were amazing. My wife and I anticipated enjoying many tacos, but after having the nachos were stuffed. Better yet they have a 7 day a week happy hour! Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with three girlfriends and my 85yo gram. We all enjoyed everything we ordered to eat and drink - absolutely delish! Our only downside of the evening was when our server disappeared for about 45 minutes and we were waiting to order dessert...When he finally reappeared, we inquired about desserts - \"...possibly some type of ice cream?\" He looked at us like we were crazy. So we point out that we had seen a guest eating an ice cream cone. *crickets* We then point out the guy eating the ice cream cone and our waiter turns around to see what we are talking about. After he turns around he says, \"Oh! Yes, we have ice cream.\" (Sweet....I think we are getting somewhere...)We are finally able to get our hands on a dessert menu and ordered the Toasted Coconut Ice Cream Sundae - Pretty yummy! The ice cream was rather tart and we were looking forward to the coconut whipped cream (which was missing). Honestly, service deserved 2 stars. Food - 5 stars all the way! (The patio is a great place to hang out on a beautiful night!)"}
{"text":"We went in here today thinking that it would be amazing and unfortunately we were disappointed.

Im a big fan of queso so we tried their queso and it came out tasting more like cottage cheese.

I also got the salmon bowl and the salmon came undercooked. 

My friend got the shrimp bowl and it came with 3 shrimp. 

Its an awesome set up but dont go here thinking youll get a great meal"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Diego Pops for a really long time, ever since I came to Scottsdale as a tourist years ago and saw a little hut-like establishment with a neon pink sign outside.
I finally went inside and was greeted by the coolest walls ever. There was a sign that read \"Peace, Love & Tequila\" - awesome life mantra -, a badass picture of Frida up, anda bright neon phrase in Spanish with \"Mexico\" lit up in pink.
I'd of course, heard about their delicious tacos, and trust me, they were amazing, but what really stole the show were the Brussel Sprout Nachos! First of all, I know this sounds a strange. Brussel Sprouts? Really? But just go ahead and order it with your friends/family/significant other and you will not regret it. The Brussel Sprouts, Oaxaca cheese, picked onions, and even a fried egg - all of it worked together. The cheese was so creamy and balanced out the sprouts while the nachos provided a base. I'm still perplexed on why this dish tasted so delicious. I honestly almost forgot about my tacos because I became distracted with these Brussel Sprout Nachos, that's how good they were!
As for service, I am knocking one star off because service was a little slow, despite not having too many people there, and our food was out and waiting to be picked up at the counter so that by the time it got to us it was lukewarm. 
Despite this, it won't deter me from returning. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try their margaritas, but they have both a Watermelon Mint Margarita and a Prickly Pear Margarita which both sound bomb. Or just my excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is poppin'. Music, crowd, it's a young, energetic vibe here. The décor is colorful and artsy. We came for a quick bite after exploring both Phoenix and Scottsdale. Got a couple beers and the brussel sprout nachos to share. I got the $5 beer and taco deal for checking in. I ordered the plantain taco. Overall, good experience, since we didn't order any entrees, I we would just caveat that. They did forget the extra fried egg we ordered for the brussel sprout nachos, which they brought out on a small plate after reminding them. The flies were a bit annoying, we kept having to shoo them away from our food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Some great things have happened here. food is pretty good as well. Actually like the Brussels Sprout nachos, and I'm not a fan of Brussels Sprouts."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and happy hour prices. They were very generous with the tequila in their house margarita- so good. Definitely a HH worth checking out if in Scottsdale. Also great thing, they had parking in front of the restaurant so you don't need to park on the street."}
{"text":"I must say that it's my first time at this place and I was impressed. My friend said the tacos were great. I was hesitant at first but then I tried the shrimp, bbq chicken and steak tacos. They were good sized and really good. Their chips and salsa with guacamole was also good and their happy hour was excellent. Who can beat half off apps when they're already priced well along with $3 beers?! Outstanding atmosphere, good background music and modern furnishings. Great customer service as well.

Definitely coming here again! Not your average spot."}
{"text":"My friend brought us here before a night at the bars because she had been wanting to try the brussel sprout nachos and it was KILLER. Brought more people the next weekend and tried the poke and plantain chips and shared a burrito bowl. The only thing that could have improved would be stronger drinks. We got pitchers of margaritas (fresh watermelon lime is DELICIOUS) both times and even after two, we were stone cold sober. Cant wait to try more of the menu, just maybe different drinks."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've come here about 10-15 times now and every time is a great time.The food is always so so good, I've tried a handful of things on their menu and everything is so delicious. All of the employees are so nice, helpful and always have an answer to any questions I may have. The happy hour prices are great and I definitely try to come here during those times to save some money. It can get super busy though during the weekends so beware of that and possibly having to wait a little for your food, but it's totally worth it! I have nothing but great things to say about Diego Pops and will always be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Seriously my new favorite place in old town to go after work. Great happy hour prices but I totally underestimated the amount of food they give you when I first came here and overate haha. The taco bowls are huuuuuge. I also love love love that you can get jicama and cucumber as a side. And honestly the only thing that Diego Pops is missing is flan in their dessert menu. If they added that I would be there every day."}
{"text":"Who would think you could convert a pottery store into a cool restaurant?  Great atmosphere, great service, reasonable prices...great combo, and fun!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. I had the skirt steak (highly recommend) and the pineapple pork tacos al la carte. Service started really good and slowly our waiter faded away into the distance. They were out of ice cream (what?) so no dessert but that's okay because we ate three platters of chips and salsa. Cute joint, I liked the pineapple wallpaper. Retro vibe. Overall, good experience and would return, especially with $2 taco Monday's!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Tacos seem over priced for what they are but the drinks and apps are priced well. Only thing I didn't like is it seems very stuffy while inside there."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. Horrible service, horrible drinks (ordered the prickly pear margarita) which had absolutely NO FLAVOR. Also, ordered the house burrito... a burrito with just refried would have had more flavor. Which was also served with a small handful of broken chips. Never going back there."}
{"text":"BEST happy hour I have yet to find! 50% off all appetizers & margs. We ordered white sangria, quesadilla, street corn, and chips & guac! Honestly sooooo good and each appetizer is 1.) the size of an entire meal and 2.) only $2-4! I recommend parking in the underground garage behind the restaurant, because their parking lot is tiny and normally packed/hard to get out of. Our server was super sweet, but she did keep forgetting a few things and our soda was flat even though she brought it out twice. I wouldn't complain because of how cheap everything is, but for the area (Old Town) I'd expect a little more. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was tasty and I loved the patio area. The service was also great. If you are looking for a cute new place to eat some good tacos in old town Scottsdale, Diego pops all the way!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Diego Pops last night.  I recommend eating on the patio - it is so great!  I loved the brussell sprout nachos (yep, I said brussell sprout nachos) and the Guava Coconut cocktail - sooo yummy!  I heard a lot about the pink sauce which frankly didn't sound great to me, but it really is awesome!!  So glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Went to Diego Pops for happy hour.
Really good offering for food and drinks, there was even free tasting for 1800 Tequila
Food: was good, it was tasty, but the portions are small
Facility: Very nice outdoor seating, it was midMay and parking is plenty
Service: was very attentive
Overall: very good experience"}
{"text":"Great patio atmosphere and great margaritas!   Those two things make up for the very very slow service. The chips were awesome and we had the salsa, guacamole and street corn queso.  I would recommended them  all. To finish it off we had the cod and shrimp tacos.  They didn't disappoint. The place is charming and feels like you are sitting in Baja.  Just go with the same attitude."}
{"text":"This is a trendy and modern turn on classic Mexican food.  We especially loved the six different sauces/sauces."}
{"text":"Such a great happy hour from 3-6pm/ 7 days a week. Amazing food... try the Brussels sprout nachos!!  The bartender Britney was super sweet and made amazing margs.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Diego Pops was absolutely delicious! I had the braised green chili chicken and crispy cod tacos. I loved both. Perhaps what put them over the top was the sauces that I could add to them. I also had their award winning guac and chips and salsa. The guac deserved the award. So good! But I also loved the salsa. It had just enough bite to it. We topped the night off with the churro fries. OMG! Seriously eat here!"}
{"text":"Delicious sauce selection! Great menu selection a do would love to try the tequila flight"}
{"text":"They had pretty decent food, but it wasn't better than other Mexican food I've had. I got the green Chile chicken taco bowl and it could've used more spices. The hot sauces they provided were not spicy at all, not even remotely. And I put quite a bit on. If you like food with a kick, you won't get it here.
The margaritas were great though!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our first time to Diego Pops. We sat outside because the weather was so nice but the inside decor is very cool. The service was friendly, the tacos were delish, & the pablano cream dip was amazing! $3 tacos on Mondays. My only complaint is that I wouldn't bring my 4 kids back because of how immodest some of the waitresses were dressed."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican style restaurant with nice outdoor seating and a bar. The prices are decent for the portions of food. 

The staff was pretty friendly. And the food was good I am used to this category of restaurant providing free nachos and salsa to start, but here it comes as an app. They lost my five vote because the menu text was kind of faded, and there a was delay in the nachos water refill at first, and it took a little time to get a to-go box. 

The street taco portions look small, for the $4.5 price, so I went for a bowl size. While the portion does not look big, if you ate nachos or something as an app, you will still have enough left over to take home in a box."}
{"text":"This is typically my favorite Mexican place in old town, but I went last night and it was a total mess. It took 15+ minutes to get drinks and my nachos came out cold without any queso on them. Who gives nachos without queso? Paying $30 for a terrible meal is not something I ever want to do again. I would go back for happy hour during the week, but will never again go on a Friday night. They clearly don't know how to handle the rush"}
{"text":"I approach Diego from the side of the bar. My pickup line? Entirely unoriginal, but you can hear the sincerity in my voice. \"Where are you from?\" I ask, mystified by ethnic ambiguity. 

He laughs. \"Half-Mexican, half-Hawaiian,\" he says in a way where I can tell he's been asked that question by many a suitor before me.

After a whirlwind of an evening with the Mexican Trail Mix Salad, topped with adobo BBQ chicken (a plethora of green things, crunchy things, fruity things, and a tangy bird), I'm left with a sudden realization. 

It may have only been one night, and sure, I only know half of Diego (and I couldn't even tell you whether or not it's his better half) but hell, I'm in it, and I'm in it to win it."}
{"text":"No matter how many times I come here, I'm just so unimpressed with the flavours of the food. I wish I could like this place more; it has a great patio, and the service was decent. The taste of the food is important, and in this restaurant's case, the food was underwhelming.

We came as a group and they were able to accommodate the 6 of us easily. The misters were on, and the sun was shining. A good start to our dinner. 

Service: Service was fine. The waitress came around regularly to make sure our drinks and food were okay.

Food: I ordered a California burrito with rice instead of french fries. Maybe I should've kept the fries? I don't think it would have made an improvement. The food itself was pretty gray and boring looking. They have a decent happy hour where the appetizers are half-priced.
Chips and salsa aren't free, but are only $1 during HH. The guac and chips+plantain chips came out to slightly over $4. They were pretty good, not the best, but enjoyable in a group setting. We also ordered some habanero mango hot wings. Those were pretty good and came with some jicama and cucumber sticks. The veggies looked liked they'd been cut much earlier in the day and were just sitting there.

One thing that makes the restaurant unique is the array of sauces available. There are six different bottles of condiments for you to put on your food. I honestly prefer to have the chef season the meal as he deems best, but if it is kind of fun to have the option to have all these sauces. Nevertheless, the sauces I used were unable to make my meal enjoyable. 

With the staggering number of other Mexican restaurants in the area, Diego Pops will not be the first one I choose when going out."}
{"text":"Great taco shop !!! Everything is really fresh and comes out fast. They have a lot of options and if your not sure what to get ask the server, they have great recommendations. Also ask them what kind of tortilla goes best with the taco you ordered... Makes a big difference. Also make sure and try the sauces they drop off on your table.

Tacos to get...

Adobo BBQ Chicken
Charred Skirt Steak
Braised Green Chili Chicken
Extra Limes 

Sauces to get...

Roasted Garlic and Beet Creme Fresh
Serrano Ranch
Chipotle Mayo"}
{"text":"Love the tacos and the refries were so smoky and delicious! Ben is a wonderful server thank u Ben! Everyone was very nice good customer service."}
{"text":"Good thing they do Taco Mondays cause that shit is trademarked by Taco Johns (your typically mediocre fast food chain restaurant) the tacos are the perfect size for tiny hands and are filled with a delightful spectrum of savory flavors. I can't remember the one I had as that night was filled with too much drinking, which caused me to brown out. For your typical yelp review, the atmosphere was sublime, the music was on point, and the service was ok. I think I got better service from a blind sales person telling me I look dope in that suit than I did here. 

Overall, I still had a great time and they deserve an almost 5 star rating. They're a 4 star business, A 4 STAR BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Specials and fun atmosphere.  Love the drinks that are served in the coconut."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My fiancé and I come here all the time and we can't get enough of this place. There isn't a bad taco on the menu and you have to try the different shell styles. I love a good guacamole and Diego Pops has a fantastic one. Their queso is also terrific. Great drink selection and a killer dessert bar adds to the whole experience. We love the ambiance and the feel of the interior and we love to hang on the patio on cool days. 

Honestly, if you love Mexican food and especially love tacos, look no further. This place should be around for a while. 

Special shout out to our server Taylor who took care of us tonight. She was great!"}
{"text":"I met S1 & S2 here for lunch. Diego Pops has a very cool vibe. The beautiful patio area on the south side of the restaurant is awesome.  Our host sat us right away with a smile and some pleasantries. The inside is clean with a slight midcentury groove. The exposed bricks on the interior does give the feeling of a retro fitted 80's Taco Bell (A good thing). 

S had asked me where I wanted to eat. I checked out Yelp and it seemed that Diego Pops had so many 5 Star reviews I figured it must be amazing. Well, not so much. I was rushing so I didn't really read the reviews, I just scrolled down past the numerous 5 Stars. I should have read more. The issue is there are a lot of reviews that don't say anything about the food. Zip. Just \"great service\" so here's 5 stars. Wow. I guess if someone figures out a way to eat service I could understand it. But can you imagine someone writing a review for a movie and only saying the popcorn was great, the seats were comfortable and then say nothing about the movie but give it the top of the scale rating. Diego Pops is a restaurant. For me, good service is an expectation, not a luxury or \"bonus\" feature. I come for the food and if it's amazingly good and the service matches it, 5 stars for sure. But I've said it before, if the service is bad but the food is awesome, I'll come back and just make sure I get a different server but I certainly wouldn't toss out a 1 star with a lot of whining. In my opinion, it should be about the food.

Off the soapbox. All that being said, our service was great. Our server Taylor was very nice, kept our drinks filled, was not intrusive to our conversation and paced everything correctly. She answered our questions and generally made us feel welcome. She even handled ALL of the special requests S2 had with grace. Nice job Taylor. 

We started our meal with an order of the Brussel Sprout Nachos ($10). Now this could possibly be one of the greatest food items of 2015. But, our order was just not done correctly. It's hard to tell how the Brussel sprouts are cooked because so many on our order weren't. Raw or almost raw Brussel sprouts can be a bit hard to chew and enjoy. I think these were supposed to be steamed and then sautéed but most weren't. Personally, I would just roast them but that's just me. The Brussel sprouts sit on a pile of really nice tortilla chips that are covered with street corn queso, queso Oaxaca, Fresno chili's, pickled onions and a roasted garlic beet crema. The whole pile is then topped with a fried egg. Ours was beautiful, perfectly cooked. Cutting into the egg and having it ooze over the nachos was just plain yummy. If the Brussel sprouts would have been cooked properly, this would have been an amazing dish.

S1 ordered the Skirt Steak Bowl ($11.) with coconut white rice and stewed beans. His bowl included the white rice and beans topped with a good portion of grilled skirt steak, house slaw, grilled onion slices and crispy leeks. The guacamole was mysteriously missing. S1 said this was a very tasty bowl. The skirt steak was cooked a bit on the well done side, but all in all a good effort.

S2 ordered a Braised Green chili chicken Taco ($3.50), a Crispy Cod taco ($4.) and a side of Cilantro Lime Rice ($2.) S2 said everything she ordered tasted fine but that it was nothing special. The green chili chicken was nicely spiced and the flavors well integrated. The crispy fish taco was also fine. She felt the fish could have had a bit more crisp to it but overall it was a good effort. She enjoyed the rice without much comment. It seemed to me like her whole meal was a good value.
 
I ordered the Crispy Cod bowl ($10.00) with brown rice and creamy beans. This was a miss ALL the way through. First and most important, the fish was not crispy. Nor would it ever be because it was sitting on top of the rice and creamy beans and then covered by the house slaw. So, it basically steamed and if there ever was a crispy coating, it was soggy before it reached our table. Why, if the main ingredient is the crispy cod, would you not put it on top to showcase it? This was a serious bush league mistake. The main ingredient should be the focus and standing out in all of its glory. The mistakes continued. There was no guacamole, I got pickled onion instead of grilled onion and there was no crispy leek anywhere. I think it bailed with the guacamole. So for ten bones I basically got what tasted like a tostada with soggy fish, without the tortilla. No Bueno.

We all ordered Iced Teas and at ($3) a piece, they're expensive even for Scottsdale. The tea was great and Taylor brought us all To-go teas to take with us so I guess in the end it's a wash. 

I like Diego Pops. However I think the food could use some work if it's going to truly be a 5 Star, heck, even a 4 Star experience.
Great service, Great vibe, fair prices, awesome Nachos in theory, average food at best delivered. 3 Stars"}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at Diego Pops yet then you are probably not that cool..  All the cool kids are def eating here so if you're trying to score some cool points then you know what to do.   Brittany was my server and she's obvi the best...  Ask her for Sangria it's her fave drink to deliver and it's now my go to here..."}
{"text":"I come here a few times a month to meet my boyfriend for lunch hour. Food here is absolutely amazing! Very unique, we always get the brussels sprout nachos. I know it sounds weird, try it. 

The service is pretty slow however, if you are on a timeline let the server know right away otherwise it's going to be one long lunch. 

I never noticed the Treat Stand before my last visit. I ordered a $2 ice cream cone with fruity pebbles and received an amazing bucket of ice cream! Im absolutely coming back even if it's just for the treats. For $2 you'll need to share."}
{"text":"For starters the food was ok, not great not bad....middle of the road, but a bit pricey for what you got. 

The reason I won't go back there though is one of those little reasons that just leaves a bad taste in your mouth about a place.  We were there for lunch, there was probably only 4 other tables of people eating in the whole place.  We ordered a couple beers with lunch, and after about 10-15 minutes the waitress comes back and says, \"sorry the kegs were empty they are just changing them out.\" I reply, \"No big deal...we are not in a rush, thank you\" ...HERE is the issue...she follows it up with \"while you wait do you want some chips and salsa?\" me: \"sure that's fine, thanks!\"

I was charged for the chips and salsa..Now it is only $2 so I don't care about the cost of them at all, and didn't say anything because clearly....it's $2.  However, when something is presented as \"sorry for the delay, would you like this while you wait?\" ... and then get charged for it...it's just a really terrible way to conduct business. It's the principle on how things are done, and that $2 (probably a .20-.30 cent cost to the company) is going to be something that keeps me from going back.

....oh, and the \"slaw\" was essentially just chopped/thin lettuce."}
{"text":"Food is good. I like the skirt steak taco bowl (although it said it was supposed to come with guacamole and mine had none) and the sweet corn avocado caesar salad. However I would say the service is below average. And last time I went with my boyfriend I was so excited to order the Toasted Coconut Margarita and it was literally a coconut full of tequila. Instead of remaking it they brought me over a small glass of coconut water to add to it. Not impressed. 

Overall it's okay. I will probably stick to getting take out lunch from now on."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and had a great time! Half-priced apps at this time, so we got chips and salsa (for a buck!) and Brussels sprout nachos. I also got a plantain taco. The food matches the awesome atmosphere--colorful, fun and flamboyant! The Brussels sprout nachos were the best nachos I've ever tasted, and absolutely beautiful! 

I wasn't impressed with the white sangria, but other than that, I have nothing negative to say! The waitstaff was great and there's a kitschy Choco Taco stand by the bar. What more could a girl want! 

Great spot for all occasions, kids welcome!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Be sure to hit this spot up for great tacos, tequila, and an awesome wait staff. Tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"Was hoping I'd have a better experience coming here but unfortunately there were a few problems that can definitely change my perspective.
The restaurant does have it's own signature Mexican styled look, Which is definitely nice having something different around here. 
Unfortunately that was the only thing I really enjoyed about this place. I ordered a Margarita and for the price ($11) you should expect to get fresh ingredients and a decent pour. As for someone who LOVES Margaritas this was a HUGE disappointment. The drink was so watered down it tasted like old sour mix with cheap tequila in it. And the best part was for a place that has \" True Margaritas \" you'd expect it to be in an ACTUAL Margarita glass not a rocks glass.
I decided to have a quick appetizer with it, I ordered the chips and Salsa. It took over 20 minutes to get it .. 
I hope my next experience can change my mind about coming here."}
{"text":"After a night out at DJs we chose to close the evening with some Mexican food. I was with a group of locals and they suggest Diego Pops. 

Upon strong recommendations we ordered the Brussels sprouts nachos for the table to share. They were delicious!! Definitely a must get if you visit. 

We had a friendly waiter who provided great service. So why 3 stars? Someone who was not our waiter came by to let us know they were closing soon and we had 5 minutes to finish up. Not a problem! We were working on finishing up our remaining meals. Less than 2 minutes later the same person came back and took our meals from the table without asking if we were finished (I was still enjoying my bowl). The end of this service left a poor impression and I will question if I will return back here, despite the delicious food."}
{"text":"I had the Brussels sprouts Nachos 4 separate times this past weekend. If that doesn't tell you what you need to know I don't know what will."}
{"text":"Gotta love the drink in an actual coconut. Flies plantains are amazing! The ceviche was pretty good too. Didn't have to wait long and we had the best server-Anthony!"}
{"text":"The drinks are to die for. The margarita's were right in the Goldilocks range: Not too sweet, not too sour. Perfect. Great patio for relaxing in the amazing weather. Amazing and genuine service. They take great pride in their food and atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Cool vibes, great food, outside seating. 

My Sonoran hot dog was just ok, wouldn't recommend it, but everything else was terrific. Especially the brussell sprout nachos. 

4 stars bc my drink was empty most of the night and the service was a bit lacking, but nothing dramatic. Our server just didn't come around too much. 

Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Great patio, Mondays are a great day to go, but even if not a Monday their Happy Hour is a great deal. Actually overall their prices, considering its Old Town are fair and their food is fresh and flavorful. Defiantly will be a return customer! They lost a star due to the flying bugs on their patio."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I came here and did not get the brussels sprout nachos!!! I totally spaced it (possibly due to the copious amount of drinks that were imbibed on this particular night). Anyway, I guess that's a reason to return sooner rather than later. Diego Pops was a fun little restaurant with excellent service. A friend and I went around 9:30 at night, and they were semi busy, but not crazy. We ordered the chips and salsas.... the salsas were all delish. It was fun to eat the chips with the 4 or 5 different salsas. We also tried 4 different tacos, and all were tasty with the fried fish being the most  underwhelming and the pineapple pork and machaca being the tastiest. All were fairly good and large! The one drink we tried was the guava coconut because....well... it's served in a coconut!!! The drink itself was just ok, but it added to the experience. I would LOVE to come back for happy hour the next time I find myself in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco de Mayo during happy hour (3-6pm). I was able to use the yelp check-in offer for a taco and beer for $5 which is an amazing deal. Tacos are normally around $4-5. Each table comes with 6 types of sauces to add to your meals. Don't forget to try them out!

Service: The waitress was quick and thorough with taking and entering our order. However, the waitress kept forgetting things we requested such as extra napkins and cups of water. The person who brought our order out had no idea what he was carrying had to go back and forth 3 times before he got it correct.

Food: Braised Pineapple Pork was good. Pork was a little dry, but for $5 (combo with beer) definitely worth it. I wish it would've come with 2 tortillas so that i could split it in two. I also got the Sonoran Hot Dog. I enjoyed its Brioche bun the most. So SOFT! I forgot that it was supposed to have bacon until towards the very end of my dog... The beans might have overpowered a lot of the different ingredients including the bacon. I would ask for less beans. 

Come here during happy hour and don't forget to check-in to use the yelp promo! Don't expect the best service during its peak time."}
{"text":"I am giving this place five stars for the food as the Tacos are the bomb and the sauces that you get with them are so damn good as well, get the beet or avocado sauce, they just make the Tacos amazing, which they already are. 

I am giving the bar staff especially Jen 10 stars for serving the best drinks, I don't know what the Snottdale crowd is complaining about the service being slow? Seems some of these reviewers are use to people catering to themselves, Diego Pops is laid back, no need for that garbage. 

The only problem we had was I brought my dog after coming from the Dog Park, the girl manager on duty was just so you know we don't allow dogs on the patio, I was like didn't know Since its a awesome patio for dogs. My dog is well behaved and people seemed to be not bothered by him. He was getting a lot of hellos and hey's, manager comes over and states \" we cant have your dog here\" while I was eating my tacos and drinking a beer? I told her we would leave once we were done, I've been here since the beginning since this placed opened and she's a new manager, but the way she said it  the second time was completely \"rude\" and there was no need, since my dog was sitting by my chair at the bar and there was so issues. Its too bad Diego Pops doesn't allow dogs here, because it has the perfect patio for it.

I still will come here after this experience, because I am about good food and great service from the friendly servers and bartenders."}
{"text":"Diego Pops, a location that has a pink sauce you put on your tacos. Now when I first came to eat at Diego Pops I was skeptical and confused with a bright pink roasted garlic, beets, and cream. My culinary teacher had always told me that we eat with our eyes first and foremost. So I was terrified, before I tasted this magical concoction. So I believe the quote that applies to Diego Pops is \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"

When you first enter Diego Pops you notice a quote \"como Mexico no hay dos\" (Like Mexico there is not two) I have not been to a Mexican restaurant quite like this. My first thought was \"It is Scottsdale, I don't want to over pay for Mexican food.\" Everything was blown away as soon as I had gotten to taste my first appetizer Brussels sprouts nachos ($10) who knew that Brussels sprouts and pink taco sauce with an EGG on top make the best nachos I have ever had. These are not your basic nachos the brussels sprouts make this dish amazing, it provides a unique texture and crunch and the taste just melts away inside your mouth. 

Okay if you get only one item at Diego Pops you HAVE TO HAVE TO get the Braised Green Chile Chicken Taco ($3.5). (Get corn tortillas 100% of the time all the time, anywhere!) Ok, I must confess I would not have ordered this item if I was not with my girlfriend, who is Mexican and super picky about her Mexican food (She says nothing is better than my momma's cooking and I agree). She told me that she half expected her mother to pop her head out of the kitchen. 

What I regret not eating is the poke, after a certain amount of time (We came at 10pm) they do not serve poke. I heard it was great from a friend, but I will be sure to come extra early next time to try that poke poke. Overall this place is just amazing and I will be eating here regularly.

What I had eaten from best to worst:Braised Green Chile Chicken Taco ($3.5), Beef Machaca ($4), Brussels sprouts nachos ($10), Charred Skirt Steak ($4.5), Braised Pineapple Pork ($3.5)  California Burrito ($9)

Oh don't eat a California Burrito... it was below mediocre."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Diego Pops! My friend was 30 minutes late and my server Anthony did a wonderful job of checking up on me! He was so nice and welcoming! My friend and I each got tacos and they were all delicious. Ask for Anthony if you go!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing Diego Pops isn't in my hometown. If it was, I'd be there every day stuffing my face with tacos and margaritas, and I'd be 20 pounds heavier.

I came here for lunch on a recent business trip to Scottsdale. It came highly recommended by locals and Yelpers alike. After sitting down in their sunny, inviting patio, I could immediately see why. This place looks like an all-day fiesta. Hoppin' bar; friendly servers; cold beers; fresh guacamole; young, attractive patrons. Who could ask for anything more?!

Our table feasted on their famous Brussels Sprouts nachos; Street Corn Queso; and guacamole and chips. For our entree, you can choose from a variety of tacos featuring fresh ingredients and meat/chicken/fish hot off the grill. This place ain't no Taco Bell. It's the real deal. I wound up ordering the Braised Green Chili Chicken Taco which comes with crema, cotija, house slaw on a crispy corn tortilla. I could've eaten 10 of them!

BTW, if you check in on Yelp you can take advantage of a $5 taco/beer special. 

If you're in the Scottsdale area, I'd highly recommend this spot for an outdoor lunch or happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good reviews and I was excited to try a new-ish place in Old Town. I thought the parking situation was going to be terrible but we got lucky finding a spot not far from the place and when we walked up there was plenty of parking in front and on the side of the building. We got seated right away and I instantly love the decor and the music. For a Sunday it wasn't packed but a good crowd was in attendance. 
They have a fairly large patio and outside bar area. We sat down and about 2 minutes passed as we perused the menu that doubled as a placemat. One of the waitress walked up and asked if anyone helped us yet and explain that she wasn't our waitress and confused to where our waitress was but she would be happy to take our drink order.  We ordered drinks and chips and salsa ($2), they came out promptly while we continued to wait for our drinks. Almost halfway into our chips and salsa another waitress out of nowhere asks if we needed drinks and we gave her our order too. She walked by 3 times after asking us and never brought us anything. Finally we got our drinks 20-ish minutes. :( This place is nice but the service is not so great. Our \"waitress\" was nice and friendly but we never seen our original waitress. 
The chips were a bad mix of yesterday's chips and today's chips. I didn't want to waste anymore money here on food.  In short I was disappointed. 
Prolly not coming back."}
{"text":"The waitress described the Brussels Sprouts Nachos as lifechanging...and they were!  Recommend the coconut margarita for an exciting evening. The crispy cod taco was a steal for 3 bucks on taco night (Monday) Creative food, welcoming staff and excellent value!  Have fun!"}
{"text":"I really was excited to try this place! Everyone raves about it but I was disappointed with both the food and service. I think we may have come before the rush of it all, so it was maybe in between shifts. Regardless, we seemed to be almost a nuisance to our server. Even getting more water seemed like a huge request. I got a chicken bowl with rice and it tasted reheated and was barely warm. I was even more disappointed when I lated saw tables get a giant carrier of salsas to try, which I didn't get. My dish really needed it too! It wasn't terrible and I honestly want to try it again in hopes that I have a better experience before I completely cross it off my list."}
{"text":"Came in today excited to see what all the good reviews were about. Sat at the bar while to wait for my friend, place was slow and only 4 other people sitting at the bar as well and 2 people working behind it. I was greeted after about 15 minutes by the girl working the bar, however, not once did she asked if I wanted anything to drink or eat, once my friend arrived we had to ask her of she could take our order which she did . I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito and a small side of skirt beef that took about 30 minutes to arrive and when it did it was cold, furthermore, after bringing our food we were not even offered silverware! Food was mediocre and service was beyond terrible. My friend and I had to ask for water since it was never offered to us and not once were we asked if we wanted something to drink. Cute place but the staff is the worst. Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place a dozen times and went in for the first time for happy hour with my friend today. I am super bummed because I loved the Brussel sprouts nachos, but did get a case of food poisoning after. :("}
{"text":"Loved it!! In town visiting from Colorado and was impressed. As an artsy person I was thoroughly happy with the interior design. But overall the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Again I found myself at Diego Pops and am as impressed as ever. The Appetizer Nacho dish is massive and gluttonously delicious, particularly when the excellent array of varying sauces is introduced. My girlfriend enjoyed her tacos. The margaritas are wonderful. Eat here."}
{"text":"Their salsa is amazing, and I love the colors of the place! Last time I was there they offered me coconut water fresh from the coconut. Now, that is all I want to order. Friendly staff and perfect location in Old Town. The happy hour on Sundays is a great deal too!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go for happy hour! They have unique takes on tex mex cuisine. Be sure to get their nachos. They look like they would be an odd combo but they are absolutely delicious and I have to get them when I am in town! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Is there any Mexican food in Scottsdale that isn't out of this world? that's what I was asking myself after lunching at Diego Pops, one of numerous impressive eateries I visited while on a work trip. 

(I should preface my review of the food itself with a disclaimer of sorts: This isn't truly authentic Mexican food. In fact, I've found very, very few places north of the border that could qualify as such. Diego Pops definitely appeals to a more touristy demographic and the local college scene.) However, that makes them no less delicious. The braised green chili chicken taco includes an incredibly flavorful mixture of crema, cotija and house slaw. I highly recommend getting it on the crispy tortilla for that perfect combination of taste and texture. The grilled shrimp was equally tasty, served atop corn salsa, red onion, queso oaxaca and salsa verde. 

I could see this place becoming sort of a madhouse at peak hours, but thankfully we ate a late lunch and avoided any real rush. The outdoor patio, with big tables and a slatted overhang to keep you semi-protected from the sun, is a great place to eat and drink. If I could suggest changing anything, it would be to recommend just a plain iced tea to serve. I don't need the fancy stuff."}
{"text":"I loved this hip and quirky place! 

I was in from out of town and my friend recommend we go here. As soon as I pulled up I was drawn in by the pretty white lights. The decor was great, service was quick and friendly and the food was tasty.

My friend had the Brussel sprout nachos and said they were good but that they used to have much more Brussel sprouts in the past. A little disappointing there. 

I tried the pineapple pork and shrimp tacos. The pineapple pork was great and I loved the crispy corn tortilla. The shrimp was just ok and I didn't like the recommended tortilla on that one as much."}
{"text":"Kaylie (our server) gave amazing recommendations!  The guacamole, poke, fried plantains, and sweet corn & avocado Caesar were phenomenal recommendations. The watermelon mint margarita was also a refreshing treat for a late lunch on vacation."}
{"text":"Great happy hour for sure. The chicken soup and the tacos are spot on.  The joint has salsas to add as desired.  All good flavors for the different meats.   Service is very nice too.  A little gem right in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I came here once with a medium sized group and I seriously can't wait to come back and try more! I had a few tacos and drinks (be sure to redeem their Yelp deal, if they still have it!)..everything was delicious and priced great.

The guac was awesome and all the other food (nachos, other tacos) smelled and looked amazing. Definitely going to be planning a trip back when I can order a bunch and try it all."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Great happy hour, fantastic food, such a fun environment! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Enjoyed happy hour: Diego Pop Margarito was awesome, guacamole and chips, and coconut lemongrass cervical. Cervical was incredible. The tacos were incredible has several BBQ chicken and skirt steak. service was awesome. Relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE the tacos here. The shrimp and pork tacos on a corn tortilla are a must order. Chicken tortilla soup is also delicious and must be tried. Brussel sprout nachos are good but nothing to write home about but the street corn queso is actually pretty delicious.

House margaritas are good and decently strong, but I love any of Diego pop's drinks that come in a coconut. So good! 

The environment is really fun but I knocked this review down a star because the bartenders can be a bit strange. I wouldn't reccomend eating at the bar as they brought our entire order out In a Jumbled mix. 

Definitely look this place up if you are in town. Good food and a fun environment!"}
{"text":"I new age twist on authentic Mexican cuisine! This place is super good! Got there breakfast burrito super yummy fresh avocado yum! Great price awesome environment. One of the owns came out and gave us our food super nice guy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is was what made this place for me. The service was pretty mediocre when I was there and we were greeted with a lot of attitude. Definitely willing to come back especially for happy hour. They definitely serve all their food with a bit of a kick of spice (which I love but definitely be prepared)!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco/ happy hour spot! Great patio and vibe with an awesome menu and cocktails!  I loved this spot from the second I walked in. The menu has a unique health conscious spin on it with little touches such as beet crema, chia seed lemonade, Greek yogurt salad dressing which makes it even more awesome!!! I like those healthy little twists that still taste oh soo good. The Brussels sprout nachos are a must and their beans are mmmm mmm yum! The only complaint I have is their bar tenders seem to be slacking- I once waited 30 min for a margarita with a little jalapeño spice! Which as I'm writing this sounds perfect right now... Even if I do have to wait half an hour for, still so worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice decor but invest in the food. This is not Mexican food, it is really just a bar for the ASU crowd. I really not sure what the concept is supposed to be but it is just flash no substance. Don't your time unless you are just there for the drinks."}
{"text":"The combinations of flavor in every plate is finger licking good!!! The Brussels spout nachos are unreal and a MUST GET! The plantain tacos for all the people wanting something without meat and maybe lighter, is full of flavor and amazing textures! The poke bowls, burritos, and corn are big hits and everyone always raves about what they got here! Amazingly trendy place with good atmosphere and great location in old town!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for margaritas! I enjoyed the outdoor seating and the overall vibe here. It was a bit empty on a Wednesday night but I'm sure it's more exciting during happy hour or on the weekends. The parking in the front was very convenient.

I really liked the Fresh One Margarita and thought it was made with a decent amount of tequila. I wasn't highly impressed by the food to want to come back for a second round. I shared the Brussels sprouts nachos along with chips & guac with my friend and had the salmon taco and steak taco to myself. 

I would recommend trying this place just because it's a nice spot to chill and have drinks."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for a happy hour or casual dinner with friends! The outdoor area was cute, the happy hour deals were great and the Brussels sprout nachos were to DIE for! Such a unique and healthy spin on the classic appetizer--I highly recommend even the biggest skeptics to just give it a try!"}
{"text":"When we 1st walked in thru the patio area, we were looking for a host stand. We peeked around the bar, saw a host stand and were seated immediately. This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!

Update! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great. All 5 of us really loved everything. This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is just a very loud hangout that may be great for Millennials but not for Foodies. I'm disappointed to say that after waiting at least 20 minutes for our drink order we received the worst watered down Margaritas we've ever had and I'm not only talking the cheap ones for Happy Hour.  I did order the happy hour margarita and it not only was watered down but had an awful after taste My husband got a margarita with Grand Marnier and he said his was watered down and just awful. We actually asked the waitress to take them back and hoped for the best for dinner since by then we were starving. But dinner wasn't much better. My husband ordered 2 beef tacos with a side, $2.00 extra, of cilantro-lime brown rice and he received 2 itty bitty tacos with very bland brown rice. Later that night he still was complaining about the bad taste he still had in his mouth from the awful tacos. I had the salmon bowl with quinoa which was filling but the salmon was a little on the fishy smelling side, not great; maybe actually steel-head trout??? They have a great outdoor patio but it is so loud out there that you can't hear the person across from you speak. We tried to do the Yelp check-in and the waitress said we couldn't because the $5.00 off check-in was only for 1 taco and 1 beer and since we didn't want the beer we couldn't use it; sounded pretty silly since we ordered more than what was required but in a place like this we weren't surprised. Certainly no reason to ever return."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Scottsdale!  This place is more laid back than you'd expect for a restaurant in Old Town, but that's why I like it.  Jessica has waited on me twice, and she is fantastic.  Great spot for reasonably priced & delicious food."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience !! The restaurant is really cute ! Prime atmosphere good for a date night ! The food is great, the nACHOs are to die for really tasty strongly recommend this place if you are in town"}
{"text":"Soooo dope. Brittany and Wyatt are the gems of this place. Drinks were good. We didn't eat but the people next to us did and seemed to enjoy it. Brittany makes the best snow-cone margarita in Scottsdale. She is resistant to use her talent because she doesn't want to embarrass the other bartenders but I say order it and let her shine. Wyatt, you're my boy! Thanks for the great service guys. We had fun

- your iowa boys"}
{"text":"Love the outside patio!! Great chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool! We got the brussel sprout nachos and that pink beet garlic sauce omg we put that sauce all over our nachos! It has a really cool vibe to it, a lot of patio space if you want to sit outside and the inside has really cool old school booths!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in the area. Tacos and tequila are always a good idea but the cute decor, great drinks, yummy food and awesome service all make this place a go-to spot."}
{"text":"We will be back.We ordered the Sweet Corn Queso w/chips for an app. and it was a big hit.Going to try to make it at home.It was that good.I had a Grilled Shrimp Taco & a Crispy Cod Taco and both were excellent.
We shared a side of Jicama+Cumccumber w/Chipolte yogurt dip that left me wanting more.All in all we had a great experience ,great service,and a fresh lively atmosphere.They also had a couple long tables with couches
that for larger groups than our six."}
{"text":"Came here after another restaurant in the area had terrible service. This place is great! The decor is so cool, a mixture of a 50's diner and a Mexican restaurant. I had the Adobo BBQ Chicken taco bowl. It was delicious! I'll totally come back to try the other items."}
{"text":"Meh.  

Chips and salsa - chips are average - salsa is underwhelming 

Green chilie crisp taco- ordered without slaw - tiny, tiny amount of filling - and bland

Steak taco - ordered on flour with no slaw.  Meat was cold and again bland.   

NOT what I was looking for or expecting.   Outside of atmosphere- 2 clicks up from a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much I went twice on my four day vacation to Scottsdale. The menu is simple and clean. I ordered the steak skirt burrito bowl the first time and it was delicious. My favorite part about this place is the sauces they provide you! Anything from habanero salsa to beet mayo they got you covered. Also, this place is definitely photogenic and looks like a \"blogger\" spot. The decor is adorable and has an outdoor setting with a bar as well. On Monday's all of their tacos are $3 which is a great deal!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Cannot believe it took me this long to try it out.  The staff is great, very friendly and knowledgeable.  The drinks are delicious and the homemade salsa selection gave it that real street taco feeling with gourmet flavors.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Always in pursuit of the perfect Mexican meal. The place, the vibe, the food and the service was poppin! Our server McKenzie was a rock star! 

Menu was simple, reasonably priced and the Margarita offering was well crafted without going over the top! 

Based on our order, I can confidently recommend the Street Corn Queso Fundido, the Cerviche was superbly executed with a hint of coconut, the wings were A++. Burritos were solid. 

Overall great meal! Good time!"}
{"text":"I utterly adore this place. We come here A LOT. They have a great happy hour. Prices are more than reasonable for Scottsdale and everyone that works there is super friendly. Almost everything has been delicious and: Taco Monday!!! 
Hopefully owners/managers read this bc two things: guacamole could be better/fresher. I like that you're going out on a limb with the orange in the guac but sometimes its a flavorless mess. Second, the salads. They are not good. I got the cabbage salad once. Blech. Guys, go check out the salad with cabbage at Grassroots. That's how you make a salad. 
All in all, this place is a gem in a sea of mediocre old town choices."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I absolutely LOVE this joint! Some of the best food in Scottsdale! The chicken tortilla soup and brussel sprout nachos are to die for, must have! Jeneva was our server most recently and she rocks that place! She made us the best drinks and shots I think I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm missing something. My experience was mediocre at best. I'm disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place. We went here on a Saturday night. The service was slow, the food overpriced, and flavorless. They also ran out of guacamole, forgot to put in my friends order, then charged us for it. Diego Pops does have some redeeming qualities; chips and salsa are good, beer is cool, and their patio is fantastic. However, I will probably never go back because there is such a saturation of restaurants in the Phoenix area. Most with much better food and service. 

Sooo... I went back this past Saturday. I am happy I did. My S.O. and I were trying to decide where to eat before the Huey Lewis concert at Live Wire. Our choices are limited due to his dietary restrictions. I reluctantly agreed to Diego Pop's. We sat at the bar and were greeted by Nick. He was very friendly, hospitable, and thoughtful(explained the ingredients in the cocktails). We had a couple cocktails, split the brussel sprout nachos and ordered two tacos each. I must say, the food was delicious and the drinks were stiff and tasty! The service that we received from Nick and the other bartender (didn't catch his name) was very good! We will be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Holy god!! Everything is so so good!! Let's just start off with service... So immediate, so friendly, so helpful!! Food came out almost instantaneously!!  We ordered salsa (very spicy), guacamole (worth every penny), and their corn queso to start (out of this world)!!  The pineapple pork taco was sweet and delicious! The green chili chicken bowl was literally cooked to perfection! Needless to say we were stuffed after all this! The \"fresh one margarita\" was very fresh. Oh, and if you come Monday for happy hour (3-6) you get 1/2 price apps, and discounted drinks... And all day Monday is Taco Monday... So $2 and $3 tacos!!  This is seriously AMAZING and needs to be checked out by all!"}
{"text":"Won't be coming back to this place. It only gets a star because the app won't let you proceed without it. The bartender had attitude written all over her face the moment we walked in and was absolutely rude. She took both mine and my husband's I.D. and told me my Georgia I.D. was weird but eventually gave it back. She took my husband's international driver's license and went through this book and comes back and says it's not a valid I.D. He gives her another form of I.D. and she says that's not valid either, he needs a passport. Not everyone is from Arizona genius. Like no he's not walking around with his passport on the off chance that he might stop in a crappy place like this one with terrible service. Not once in the seven months that he's been here has anyone treated him like this just to order a drink. He carries his driver's license like all the other people because it's accepted at all the other places. To make the situation even worse, the guy sitting at the bar enjoying his drink tells us she didn't check his I.D."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Brussel sprout nachos going!happy hour is a great deal from 3:00 to 6:00!"}
{"text":"Nice drinks, nice patio....below average food. Poke bowl had very little Tuna. Queso and chips was odd flavor cheese and the steak tacos were weak.  Serving the rice and beans in plastic cups was poor presentation and the rice was dry and clumped."}
{"text":"Everything was so so.  Margs cheese crisp taco...good prices but almost tasteless.  Tequila prices were insane.  Better other choices."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my sister as we are on vacation and we LOVE this place! I highly recommend the mango elderflower margarita and the Oaxacan sunrise. They were both fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fave spots in Scottsdale. The food is easily as good as Mex food in San Diego. The brussel sprout nachos are def something diff to try!

One of the best things about the place is the vibe at the outdoor (shaded) bar. A killer spot to throw back some micheladas and margaritas in the afternoon or pregame before hitting the clubs. Great drinks and staff!

A great late night spot too, open till midnight."}
{"text":"Diego's is triggering. I change when I am here. It's the year 2017, but when I'm at Diego's, my mind mentally time travels inside a DeLorean to the 1960s. I transform into someone else. I transform into Don Draper Lite. For the uninformed, this is basically without the sexism and other reprehensible behavior, but I am down for that alcohol. What I mean is, substitute the Whiskey for their Margaritas, and I am asking for them to bring me a fresh one in the shortest, yet socially respectable intervals possible. 

Diego's bring this out in a person. Situated next door to a Big & Tall Shop, Diego's is a microcosm of the positvity that exudes from the residents of Scottsdale. The staff is gregarious. They are innately in tune with the universe to not only know when to bring you that next drink, but what you want next on the menu. Hint - get the nachos, it's like they had the idea to mix the traditional dish of nachos & cheese with everything that made you love birthday parties as a kid.

Most importantly, I never break the bank going to Diego's. I could go there with $20 and make a night that could fill an entire scrapbook. Let me make sure I am getting this point across sufficiently. Ever seen Shameless (US version, the UK version wasn't relatable for some reason)? The entire Gallagher family, including Frank, could eat and drink here. 

The only befuddling thing about this place - it's actually really strange - is that it is never completely packed. Personally, I believe this a sin akin to the destruction of the great library at Alexandria because this place is too good not to be packed. It's really odd. If you do you go next time though and it is packed, sorry for the jinx fam.

Needless to say, this place is lit and you need to get down there to eat and drink. When you do go though, please find this out for me. I have always been curious. Does Diego Pops sell lollipops? Make sure to report back fam."}
{"text":"We just killed the brussels sprouts nachos.

Our order didn't come correctly, but we were so busy and pleased w these nachos that we werent even thinking abt that. We ordered through postmates so the order being incorrect was to be expected.

The brussels were crunchy, like, super crunchy. Could have been softer. The chips were the perfect
 crunch, yet soft at the same time, and the pickled onions. I would have LOVED to have more of those. Cotija and another type of cheese. And that pink cream sauce Just yummy.

My girlfriend would still like to have her correct order of two green chili tacos, too. She only got one and it was thrown together. But in her words, \"these nachos though, Im not even mad anymore.\"

Ill def be returning. But in person."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour place for sure!! The last few times we've been in we had Lydia as our server and she was just an absolute doll :)"}
{"text":"We came in to Diego pop with a group of 15, they were very accommodating and even asked if we had a time limit. There were no complaints about the food or service. We had a wonderful time in a casual and open environment. It's a great place for groups or even intimate dates. We laughed, we ate and had a great team lunch."}
{"text":"Great tacos, beer list, and patio area.  We had guacamole and a variety of tacos and everything was fantastic.  Can't wait to return!"}
