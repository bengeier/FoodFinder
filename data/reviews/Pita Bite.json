{"text":"You wouldn't think so because of the location, but this place is a great value for catering. I've never eaten here and the place itself seems rather basic, but for large portions of perfectly-cooked shawarma and other dishes it's pretty hard to beat this place in Vaughan. Whenever I'm in town my fianc√©e's family picks up a large order from here and we eat until we're stuffed."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by and they were not busy at all. She turned on the burners for the shawarma as soon as I walked in. Gave me cold uncooked chicken...it was soo disgusted!"}
{"text":"Beef Shawarma is great and is the only thing I will order (why mess with a good thing). They add some spicy sauce and it is just great. I usually tell them just to put everything on it because I guess that it is how its supposed be.  Writing this review is making me hungry, I think I am going to go there now"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Great service and food   I go here once a week for lunch and either get chicken shawarma or the meal.   Portions are big and pice is fair.   I suggest this place if you want a good meal.  Wayyy above average 8/10."}
{"text":"Honestly it may not look fancy, but it tastes amazing. It's definitely worth it's price. The lady who served us was friendly and even helped us pick out what we wanted. Definitely coming back again whenever I'm craving a shawarma"}
{"text":"Walked in and saw the menu board and lowered my expectations, it looks cheesy, like a cheap fast food chain type of menu board, but ordered the shawarma pita anyways.   The service was friendly and she explained everything I needed to know and repeated herself if I needed her too.   They have two types of pita bread, packaged or one made in store, I opted for the in store made option although it was $1 more. The other pita's are the ones you see in every pita shop and I thought it would be nice to try something different. She made that extra dollar worth my while, once she put all the toppings on that I requested, she turned around to put the meat on when she turned back around to roll the pita I thought that's not going to work, there's too much stuff on it to close properly.   Got home and ripped into this sandwich. The chicken was nice and moist and full of flavour. The sauces were complimentary to the seasonings used on the chicken and I love the garlic sauce.  You'll definitely have to put the weak atmosphere behind you and it will be worth your while too. This was a surprising treat and happily close to home."}
