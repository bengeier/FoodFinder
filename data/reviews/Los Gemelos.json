{"text":"Great Mexican place in downtown Madison just off State Street. This place strikes you as very authentic (perhaps it was something about the luchador fights on TV in the restaurant with the Spanish commentary).  Food was awesome. Had tostadas and gorditas which were both fantastic (chorizo, steak, pastor (pork) - can't go wrong!). You can buy individual tostadas or gorditas for $3.50/$3 each though there are lots more options. Also had this amazing drink that was like milk with cinnamon toast crunch flavoring. Definitely check that out."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos throws straight heat. The Sopes are life changing. Go cop (2) Sopes (pastor + steak) and a pineapple Jaritos. Just trust me."}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic.  I go to Los Gemelos every now and then for a quick, inexpensive lunch. They have a good menu of favorites, as well as more unique items (well, unique to Americanized Mexican restaurants).   The pastor tacos are delicious-- flavorful pork garnished with cilantro and onions on corn tortillas.  Quesadillas here are not your typical flour tortilla with shredded jack cheese. No, these are handmade cornmeal pockets stuffed with fresh queso, lettuce and your choice of meat. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside!  They have tamales on the weekends, but sometimes they have leftovers that they sell early in the week. They're really good, so try to catch one sometime.  Their guacamole is mild, but flavorful from all the cilantro they use. Still, I wish it could be spiced up with some jalapeños!  Chips are average. Sometimes they are stale, sometimes you get lucky and get really fresh ones!  I like their assortment of beverages-- fountain and bottled Coke products, Jarritos, and horchata, among others."}
{"text":"Can't wait for spring so I will feel comfortable about walking about that area(new to Wi & snow)& going to enjoy this place, the staff is really nice & friendly.. the food outstanding... made me think of San Diego!!  The serving size was plentiful since I was really craving Mexican food! The restroom was clean too."}
{"text":"No frills place with excellent salsas and food.  Good flavor and even a but of heat, which is hard to get here in the Midwest so thanks for that.  Great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos is AMAZING.  I live only a block away and have been going there for about a year now.  The fresh salsa are very, very, good but beware the spiciness if you're not used to.  If you are hungry for some really fast, cheap Mex fix, then go for a couple of steak Sopes.  If you are the kind of person who wants rice and beans and make it up yourself, you want the fajitas.  Its seriously good food.  I looked in when it first opened and was like \"Wow, this place looks really cheap and shitty\" but when I went there the first time (only because it wasn't the only place packed for the women's soccer world cup match) I decided to order a taco and was very, very surprised!  Moral of the story?  Don't judge the place by how it looks.  It's like a dive bar equivalent that makes really solid drinks.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there wasn't that much of it. (I left hungry) And it was kind of  expensive! 14 bucks for chips, salsa, and a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Mexican food right on State St! Well, close enough, it's right off State on Gilman. I can't thank my co-worker enough for his recommendation. They have daily specials, selected mexican items that comes in a 'combo', which means, in mexican terms, beans and rice =)   Complimentary chips and salsa if you choose the dine-in option. But for me mostly Los Gemelos is a grab and go place since it's very close to where I work, we would call to order ahead, saves us more time that way ~~  Their sopes and gorditas are my favorite. For sopes I love the combination of beans, steak or pastor, cheese, avocado and lettuce put together on a thick flour tortilla. It's a very refreshing feeling (and taste) to bite into one of those. The gorditas are a slight different version, your choice of fillings wrapped in a Mexican styled pita pocket, as I like to call it.   Do note that even though vegetarian options are being offered, I have found the potatoes option just didn't go well with their sopes. The gorditas are fine with potato fillings, but it's still not my top choice.   Service has always been prompt and friendly. No problems with food hygiene or quality in the 8 or so times I've been there."}
{"text":"Delicious. It's the most authentic Mexican food you can get on State Street. I've only gotten takeout, so I'm not sure how the \"in-restaurant\" experience is, but I do know the food is great. My favorite is the carnitas tacos w/beans and rice. Always satisfying."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a cheap price. Although if don't really expect much in terms of customer service (it's not a fancy restaurant) I've never had any issues with the servers or food taking too long. Pretty nice place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I lived in Austin, TX for a good while so when I moved I was bummed to leave behind all the awesome Mexican food the city had to offer.  My husband and I searched and searched for a good Mexican joint until we came across Los Gemelos--it means twins in Spanish :)  The food was average.  The staff was super friendly, but the food just didn't measure up (and yes, I do have high expectations but Mexican food is NOT that hard to cook if you know what you're doing).  If you don't have a car and live close to UW, then the restaurant's location on State Street can't be beat.  However, Cucos on Buckeye Rd in East Madison (off Stoughton) sets the standard for Mexican food in Madison.  This is the place to eat if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican food--ask for Diana!  She makes killer margaritas."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison when I come up to visit. I love their tostadas carne asadas, so yum! The price is perfect, my tostadas are $3 each. Not to mention, this is the only food that actually soaks up [insert] liquids and is so good that it doesn't come back the way in came in! :P   I can't really tell any differences between their horchata or anywhere else's, but I always buy from them because I love horchata all-around. Service usually is decent with one or two of them seeming impatient or they just stare, but other than that it's fine. I love their green salsa, spicy and a good complement to the tostadas~!  I can't wait to come back here :D."}
{"text":"Yum! Great food, fast and cheap. Don't think you can get better Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"Go here enough to know the food is always consistent and well done.  The service can be spotty at times but I wouldn't say unpleasant.  The decor blows one into the contemporary streets of a Mexican MTV video.  Overall a good place to go."}
{"text":"I go here for the delicious chicken and steak tacos, 2 dollars a taco. I even like the rice and beans. The female staff are cute too. Lol."}
{"text":"Diluted Mexican cuisine.  Nothing \"hot\" about the hot sauces- either green or red.  The half of a cup of watery salsa was inadequate  to mask the flavor of the greasy if plentiful tortilla chips (for which no plates or napkins were offered).    The chili relleno and frijoles were the blandest I have ever eaten outside of a chain restaurant's drive-through. The television blared a raucous Mexican talk show to an empty dining room.  Loud, tasteless, plastic decor  for easy clean up with none of the authentic and endearing kitsch brought back from the homeland."}
{"text":"It was way better than I thought it would be.  It's not High Dining, but it's definitely authentic Mexican and very delicious."}
{"text":"Finally! An authentic Mexican place downtown that doesn't disappoint. In fact, tacos are a close second to my absolute Madison favorite, taqueria Guadalajara."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times since I discovered it just over a year ago.  Prices are great for a State Street Location, food is good, mix of mild and spicy and staff is friendly.    I love the quesadillas and sopes, they make the masa shells for these in house, and they are sooo good.  It can get crowded later at night since the place is small, but they offer take out which a lot of their customers get.   Free Chips: Yes Mexican Coke & Fruit sodas: Yes Cheap: Yes Authentic:  Yes"}
{"text":"Cold beans, mushy rice, one large tomato chunk, store bought chips.  Avocado and sauces were good.  Sorry not very good food at all.  Ordered the bean chimichangas."}
{"text":"Don't try coming here to eat within an hour of them closing or they'll shoo you away... Showed up at 7:25 only to be told I could only order to go because they close at 8?! Guess they don't care for my business"}
{"text":"The food lacked seasoning and flavor. The service was also lacking. I would not come back here again when there's places such as taqueria Guadalajara and Franciscos cantina nearby ."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like I want tacos and good authentic Mexican food I hop on over to Los Gemelos! I love the two sauces that comes with your food - the red and green one. Do note that the green sauce is spicier than the red one. I would love to learn how to make it. The complimentary salsa that comes with the meal looks watered down. But I don't come here for the salsa I come here for the yummy meals and tacos. There's a meal that I really enjoy that looks like pork chops; get it! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  What stood out to me is when a dining partner spilled his beverage when they were bringing the food, he knocked my food onto my lap.  They promptly brought another plate without us having to ask.    Inexpensive, but tasty.  Try the chorizo tacos.  Their tortillas are really good.  It's not a fancy dining experience - food comes in plastic baskets and a piece of wax paper - but it's a great value."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and authentic! I had 3 tacos (chicken, beef and pastor); thanks to the suggestion of another Yelpers. Made the same way my Mexican friends make it. The BF ordered beef quesadillas, which he enjoyed as well. Enjoyed the sauces on the table - verde = mild, red = spicy.  Will definitely be back for more food! Quick and attentive service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch and had a great experience each time.  I love the bean tostado and tacos.  Not fancy, but good, fresh Mexican food at an affordable price.  The staff say that they hand-make a lot of the food and it does taste that way!"}
{"text":"okayyishh.. Not a lot of variety for vegetarian. Have had much better mexican food!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times--food is relatively good, service is consistendly lackluster at best.    Asked for huevos rancheros since eggs are on the menu--overheard waitress at both our table and others say NO more times than yes--about everything.  Finally ordered a dish described with eggs over easy--then eggs were served like  were overdone hockey pucks.  Send them back? with whom? they were not very busy, but servers were unengaged--no one came back to check on us.  We felt like food cart patrons at a place with table service prices--and blaring TV's like the electronics dept at Walmart--cannot hear yourself think.  the food came up quickly and the interior was clean, but felt like we were an imposition versus welcome guests."}
{"text":"Basic but entirely authentic Mexican fare.  By and far these were the best tacos et-cetera that I've had in Madison.  It's possible there is still some hidden Mexican gem somewhere in Madison but there is definitely nothing on par with Los Gemelos in the downtown vicinity."}
{"text":"Eh. I'm a huge fan of the west side Los Gemelos Tienda on Odana road (a definite 5 star establishment). However this downtown clone retains none of the quality of the original. Compared to it's sister restaurant, the food is bland and flavorless. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican flavor, please please please drive to the west side location. This place is nothing but a mediocre margarita trough."}
{"text":"Finally, a place to get some great tacos for cheap. Tortillas are homemade, the salsa is amazing. If you want great service and table clothes, this is not your place. If you want three amazing chorizo tacos with rice and beans for 8 bucks, this is your place. Light on the wallet, amazing on the palate. I'm hoping this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Skip all the other Mexican places in Madison and go right to Los Gemelos.  The food is tasty and cheap and the service is good.  Los Gemelos has an unassuming interior and exterior.  The plastic booths and cheap decor might make you think that you're going to get shitty food, but slow your roll.  The food (even though it comes in plastic baskets) is made to order and very, very good.  I consider this place to be a Madison hidden gem.  Hopefully the owners will decide to update the interior to match their above-average food.  Some might find the portions small, but the small prices makes it easy to get a big meal for $6-$10.  I ordred two quesadillas and couldn't finish the second one.  The service was fine."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos is definitely one of my favorite Mexican Restaurants in Madison. The food is authentic and really delicious.  The flavors are just perfect and you always get enough food for your money. When you walk in they do give you complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was  just perfect and super delicious.  In case you did not know there are two located in Madison. I gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly I did not taste any tequila. It tasted more like a virgin margarita. I did enjoy that the lime mix was not as sour as it typically is. If you are thinking of heading down here I would call ahead just because there have been more than a few times I have walked here and they happened to be closed even though the hours or operation says open. Definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"This three-star (scored generously) experience is really half on me for not spotting the warning signs. First of all, ordering vegetarian at a place known for its meat dishes is probably unwise. You've effectively excluded yourself from the things everyone else recommends. Second, ordering Mexican food while at seminar in Wisconsin when you spend the rest of the year living four hours from the Mexican border is probably also a bad idea. Third, ordering any food at all within a half mile of a busy college campus is universally known to be a misstep. But I was very hungry and had heard good things, so ahead I went with my bad idea self.  I saw fajitas, and that sounded good. It probably should have been a warning sign that the vegetarian fajitas were the same price ($12) as the meat ones, but I instead took it to mean I could expect great things. Then I went home and realized that I'd been given reheated tortillas, rice, tomato, avocado, and about three pounds of sauteed onions and peppers. And they weren't even interesting peppers--just red and green bell peppers, with nary a hint of any spice. Since I was given two tiny cups of unmemorable salsa, I got through the sides and two tortillas worth of the veggies before giving up in boredom and despair.   So, for $14 after tax and a small to-go tip, without a drink, I'm still hungry and may have to go back out for food. I would go with two stars here, except the meat dishes coming out of the kitchen while I waited for my carryout looked quite interesting, so benefit of the doubt will be given and I'll just write this one off as a bad call and file Los Gemelos under \"not recommended for vegetarians.\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend really like this spot, they have authentic mexican food. I found it to be a little greasy and not as flavorful, but I've had a lot of American-Mexican food, so maybe I'm using that as a template to judge other Mexican cuisine. They sometimes have taco Tuesday on the Hooked App, so we occasionally take advantage of that deal. All in all not my go to, but it's still decent."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday lunch over the weekend as we were craving Mexican and this was close by.   The interior was a little bit more causal than I expected; the big menu across the top gave it more of a sit down fast food kind of a vibe.   Regardless, we were greeted promptly and asked if we were dining in or take out. We were handed menus and grabbed a table in the back. The waiter came over shortly with waters and a small thing of chips and salsa. The chip basket they bring out is small unlike most Mexican restaurants I have been too. But I almost prefer this because I usually just keep eating and eating and before you know it, two huge baskets of chips gone and no room for an entree. The smaller serving of chips is nice because I don't feel like I have to keep eating and I actually had room left in my stomach when my entree arrived haha.    The menu is a little on the smaller side, but everything looked really good. I got the chicken chimichangas and my date got the Milanese chicken torta. I've also never tried horchata, so I ordered a glass.   The Horchata was out of this world good. I highly recommend you try it. So sweet and delicious with the perfect hint of cinnamon. And while I also have never had a chimichanga before so I don't have anything I compare to, they were good! You get a serving of beans and rice with the entree. Very filling and yummy. It was fresh and hot!   If you're looking for an affordable authentic Mexican taste, try Los Gemelos! Our waiter was friendly and helpful with suggestions, which is always a plus :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. What you see is what you get. Solid Mexican food, really good prices, and the service is adequate."}
{"text":"I love the food! Just devoured some sautéed steak with fresh tomatoes, it came w a bit of sauce that was deliciously spicy. Get some good food here with a brew- ya won't be disappointed. Service was great thanks much!"}
{"text":"Great place, 4.5 stars! I had 2 carne al pastor tacos and a potato+chorizo gordita, all of which were excellent.   The tables, floor, and walls were all super clean; the service was quick and friendly;  chips and salsa were free; and the prices were good.   Having only been here once, I'm not ready to say it beats out Tacqueria Guadalajara but it's definitely in the same league."}
{"text":"Had 4 taco's steak and pastor. Food was excellent and very authentic. Service was great and food was out fast and hot. Looking forward to coming back on the wkend. They offer a little bigger menu. The salsa is home made and very good. Come for the food not the free chips. You won't be disappointed. And the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The perfect hole in the wall place! If you want great, authentic, fresh food, this is the kind of place you go!"}
{"text":"Tacos with onions and cilantro, yes please. I haven't tried the chorizo or papas con chorizo but I'm glad it's an option.   The Bistec ala Mexicana is thinly cut steak sauteed with onions, tomatoes and pickled jalapeños - the tastiest thing we ordered. For the Tostadas, the chicken is better seasoned than the steak, and they come piled high with toppings such as thinly sliced avocado. The horchata is sweet and cinnamony with no chalky after taste. A+. They offer a variety of Mexican beers by the bottle including Dos Equis, Sol, Tecate....  I'm guessing the priciness of a divey place like this has more to do with its State Street location than anything else. Prepare to pay anywhere from 10-20% more than similar establishments elsewhere. Would I take my friends from Mexico to eat here? No. Would I come back myself? Yes."}
{"text":"Oh, wow.  This place brought back memories of Mexico.  It's much more authentic Mexican than most places around here (and not so much Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex).  Not fancy -- pretty bare-bones hole-in-the-wall.  But very tasty!!!  My Enchiladas Mexicanas were fabulous with fresh avocado on top, for less than $10. Delicious home-made salsa on the side. Don't expect the same kind of \"Mexican\" that you get at chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here to grab dinner to go with my co-workers last night. The staff was courteous. Didn't take long to get our orders ready. Gave us exactly what we asked for. My meal was fantastic. Everything from the chimichangas to the rice and beans was flavorful. The horchata was perfect. Definitely coming back. If you like authentic Mexican food, come here and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Seems like they stepped up their game lately with the salsa. It's got a hell of a lot more of a kick to it.  Also got a potato and chorizo gordita this time around. It was amazing, and I hate sausage. The chorizo blended with the potatoes in a way that made it seem more like an additional flavoring to the potato rather than random chunks of meat. The potatoes were buttery and thick, and gave the whole gordita a delicious and interesting consistency. I was so excited to eat it that I burnt the hell out of my mouth in the process."}
{"text":"Definately a good taco fix.  Not the holy grail but very very decent."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food within walking distance of campus. Screw Chipotle, this place is 1000x better. The steak tacos are amazing and 2 bucks a pop. The tostadas never disappoint. This is probably the best mexican food outside of mexico/california that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Authentic and delicious Mexican food. They are incredibly fast. You can't go wrong with the sopes ( lots of fresh avocado) or the chorizo tostadas. The guacamole is great too! Love this place."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience at Los Gemelos. Waited 40 mins for food and it never came. When I asked the manager, she was not apologetic at all. I was appalled by the poor customer service. I ended up paying for a full meal to go. When I made it home, the food was horrible and tasteless.  Beware of this restaurant. Very low customer service standards. Surprised that it's still operating is such a people centered city like Madison.  Wish I could give it a Zero Star rating."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  And the price is great!  Small seating area, but I've never had trouble getting a table.  I recommend ordering a margarita and any of the dishes with cilantro."}
{"text":"Long story short: terrible service, try the restaurants I listed at the bottom instead.           Absolutely horrible service today. I want to be clear that I am talking about the location downtown, not the Los Gemelos on the westside (which I always have a great time at). We showed up before 8pm and ordered from a middle aged woman at the counter. It was a party of 5 and only tables of 4 were available, so we asked the waiter if he could pull up the chair. He cheerfully grabbed one for us. After sitting down for approximately 1 minute, the middle aged woman comes up and bluntly says \"You cannot pull up chairs. You cannot be blocking the aisles\". We were already starting to stand up as I said \"Oh I'm sorry! The waiter grabbed the chair for us and said it was fine\" but before I could get half of my words out, she cut me off in an even ruder tone \"You cannot pull up chairs.\" We end up moving to a table towards the back of the restaurant.  After about 10 minutes of nothing, we wave a waiter over and ask for waters and chips and salsa. The waiter says \"We don't have chips\" and leaves to get water (at the west side location, we've always been offered chips). Maybe 5 more minutes go by and he comes back with a pitcher of water and, I kid you not, a stack of styrofoam side cups that are the size of shot glasses (to-go cups with lids meant to hold salsa, guacamole, etc). Apparently at approx 8pm, they stop giving out cups, both reusable or plastic?   When the food arrives another 15 minutes later, it is bagged up in to-go boxes. \"We are closing soon so everything is to go.\" The restaurant does not close for another 30 minutes or so and yet they are already preparing to close and too lazy to do dishes. Not only that, half of the food is cold, the fried gorditas are soggy, and 2 of our 5 orders are wrong (they put the wrong meat on two of the tacos and forgot sides like cilantro and lime).   We finish eating well before closing time and after putting all of our garbage back into the to go bags, we ask if the waiter could toss this in the trash. Instead, we are asked to find a garbage can outside because \"the trash cans are pretty full already\".   Needless to say, I will not be returning. I highly recommend the Los Gemelos on the west side or El Pastor instead."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos is my favourite Mexican restaurant in Madison. The food is always fresh and amazing. I've never had a bad order or a negative experience. Always a speedy service to add."}
{"text":"Simply awful business. I arrived 30 mins before closing this weekend and told I couldn't eat there - only take out. What?? Never stepping foot there again; and, certainly, wouldn't recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to campus. We judge a Mexican restaurant by its chips and salsa - they were great! We had the carne asada gorditas and tacos, both were delish. Chicken tacos were also great! The beans and rice weren't the best but not that big of a deal. Two ate for $12"}
{"text":"If closing time is at 8:00, why are you sending customers away at 7:20??  We were told that the kitchen will only pack to go orders at 7:20, so we left. Not a nice way to welcome customers.    We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food at Los Gemelos is great, but be very careful when paying by credit card.  They recently mischarged my card over twice what my meal should have cost.  I caught the error right away and they brought me a revised bill, telling me they'd fix the problem later.  Two days later I see on my statement that they did not fix the problem and I had been charged for both the incorrect and the correct bills.  When I called them they were quite rude to me and told me I had to physically bring a copy of my bank statement to them to prove I had been mischarged!  So I print out my statement, bring my two receipts, and sit there for 15 minutes and wait while they figure it out (by looking at the credit card machine, why didn't they do that when I was on the phone instead of putting me through all this!!).  Once they believe me, they give me a refund by check, so I had to waste more of my time going to the bank to deposit it.  Total time wasted, 2 hours.  After a weak apology, they didn't even offer me anything for my inconvenience!   Go there, the food is good, but you might want to pay cash."}
{"text":"This place really deserves 2 stars, but it's graded on a midwestern mexican food curve. It's not terrible, it's also not terribly tasty either. It's just kind of blah. But it could be so much worse! So it's got that going for it."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of cheap tacos so after reading some reviews of Los Gemelos, I naturally knew I needed to stop by.  I can only speak to the tacos, but they were definitely what I wanted. For $2.25 a pop, you really can't go wrong. I got one chorizo, one pastor, and one chicken. I was underwhelmed by the chorizo, which is a bummer but I think that's what would get a 5 star review--its such a ht or miss thing for me. The pastor was THE BEST. Ugh, if I could do it again, I wouldnt have messed around with anything else, except then I wouldn't have discovered how awesome the chicken was. It wasn't dry, as can sometimes be the case.  Maybe it was my extreme hunger accompanied by the oops-I-mixed-beer-and-liquor-last-night hangover but I definitely want to return.  Bonus points for the Spanish music videos!"}
{"text":"Ordered chile rellenos. They were above average. Rice was average. My wife order Suiza Enchiladas and they were tasty. Overall the food was not to Texas standards, but substantially better than I expected."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos was our first stop on our first visit to Madison. It was a pretty bad welcome, and is among the strangest experiences I've had in a restaurant. Here's how it went:  Drinks were ordered and brought, then the food ordering commenced.  A basket of chips hadn't been delivered, so I thought I'd double check that they were complimentary, since we ordered the guacamole that was on special. \"We don't have chips.\" \"Pardon?\" (Bored stare) \"we don't have chips.\" \"You don't ever have chips or you don't have them today?\" \"We just don't have chips.The guy hasn't come in to make them.\" \"Do you have salsa?\" \"No.\" \"Ok, I think we might come back another time.\" \"You still have to pay for the sodas.\"  Yikes. No thanks."}
{"text":"It's cheap and has a halfway decent menu but I received absolutely horrid service here. Pretty so-so for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"No frills/fancy eats here. Just good solid tacos which taste authentic. The chips and salsa are a nice add as well. I tried one each of the steak, pork and chicken. All of them hit the spot - would recommend for those that want something quick and effective if you are out and about."}
{"text":"I love this place.. I have been here twice. And I have been to lots of mexican places in Madison. But to me it is the best of them. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Keeping it short: Taco quest came. Taco quest saw. Taco quest conquered.  Wonderfully close, cheap, and accessible. Excellent carne asada tacos, good chicken and pastor, so-so chorizo. It's authentic, though, without a doubt. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Finally, some authentic Mexican food on State Street. I'd even argue that this is the best restaurant in the neighborhood.  Tacos are served with cilantro and onion and homemade tortillas and are top-notch. Their campechano taco is a personal favorite--steak with chorizo. Pastor (pork) tacos also excellent. Red and green sauces are both outstanding, with very different flavors. The quesedilla is more like an empanada full of cheese; it's a folded over tortilla deep fried and also filled with meat. The gorditas are basically puffy masa cut in half, fried, and stuffed with meat, cilantro, and onion. The bread could use more seasoning but does the job of being small yet filling.   Absolutely brilliant compared to Chipotle or Qdoba, the only other storefronts within walking distance that offer anything resembling what you can get at Gemelos. Spend 100% of your drunk funds on tacos here, undergrads; there's no more excuse to eat white-boy chain burritos for lack of options."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but it doesn't make up for the horrible service. I went two days in a row thinking the waiters were having a bad day. However, they made it seem like my being there was an inconvenience. For anyone looking for decent Mexican in Madison, I'd recommend La Taqueria instead."}
{"text":"Seriously, thanks to the Mexican food gods for real tacos just off State Street. Chipotle, your necessity has been eliminated. I will forever be a Taqueria Guadalajara fan, but when on campus or downtown, this place cannot be beat for authentic Mexican food.  And please, don't go to a Mexican place and order a burrito or a steak quesadilla. It's about the tacos (that should always have cilantro and onions), and the gorditas, and the sopes, and the tostadas. Kind of excited to try the chorizo/potato option next time around. I love sopes, and while these are different than the TG version, they are also very good. Thick, fried (?) corn-pita type things topped with your choice of meat plus lettuce, tomato and avocado. Yum.   They have good chips and salsa too. Ask for the bottled salsa too, as it's spicier and a little more interesting than the standard pico de gallo. Also have to love getting a filling lunch for 5 or 6 bucks. The servers are really nice and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Good tacos, not great but for $2 you can't really go wrong. Margaritas definitely overpriced for what you're getting but tasty"}
{"text":"I loved Los Gamelos' tacos.  I ordered their steak taco and chicken taco.  They are served wrapped with two corn tortillas and are precisely what I was hoping for.  The steak taco stole the show as it was stuffed full with tender meat, chopped onion, cilantro, and I poured their red hot sauce on it, as well...    No sour cream, cheese only if you ask for it...    I also ordered a side of beans and rice that I was very happy with...    Only problem is I got a HORRIBLE case of food poisoning from it, was up from 1am until 2pm the next day basically having my guts removed and placed in the toilet..  Will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"SO GOOD ! That is all I really can say. The portions are good and worth the price. My belly is always satisfied after a meal there."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos is my go-to place for Mexican food in Madison. Right off of state street, it is very convenient for lunch, dinner, or a midnight snack! Really cheap for good quality meat and fresh veggies.  My favorites include the tostadas, tacos, chilaquiles (oh my god), enchiladas, but really ANYTHING with chicken and green salsa. I have been here so many times over the last three years and the chicken is always flavorful and tender. The potato and chorizo tostada is a bit of an odd combination, but it is my favorite $3 comfort food. The pambaso is the most ridiculous (giant) sandwich soaked in pepper sauce. Totally delicious and difficult to eat without getting sauce all over your face. So many good things on the menu.  It is under $10 for a huge plate of food, but I am usually satisfied with a taco and tostada for $5! I have not yet tried their margaritas, but they look pretty amazing in a few different flavors. I am always happy with whatever I get here, and service is fast and usually friendly!"}
{"text":"I can't possibly say enough good things about Los Gemelos! Not only do they have a fantastic variety of authentic (topped with only cilantro and onion) tacos, but the prices are incredibly cheap.   My go-to meal is two campechano tacos and a side of beans. If you've never had these tacos before, you must try them! The filling is a mixture of spicy chorizo sausage with crispy steak pieces. They are so good that I can't help but crave them constantly. Steak tacos are also a great choice!   With its great choice of authentic Mexican dishes and low prices, Los Gemelos is an amazing choice whenever you are close to the downtown area!"}
{"text":"I went to The Twins quite a lot in my college hayday, with most of the time being a very late night affair.  My friends seemed to be enamored by it, but I personally sort of despised it when my drunken buddies dragged me there.  To understand my displeasure, i'll refer to my \"Mexican restaurant checklist\":  Free chips/salsa? - Nope. Margaritas? - Nope, but I believe they do serve some alcohol, but I was never personally interested in it, because whenever I came here I would be coming back into sobriety Big Burritos? - Check, but i'll elaborate on this further below. Family run establishment? - I'm not sure, but i'm inclined to say nope. Cheap? - Check, but you pay for what you get. Open late? - Check.  They're missing quite a few ticks compared to other nearby restaurants, such as Francisco's Cantina.  Beyond all of this, I have one complaint that makes me dread going to Los Gemelos:  Almost all of their food sucks.  Note that half of the time i've been here, i've come after several drinks, and i'm still able to say that.  It's quite an achievement if your food doesn't hit the drunk spot.  The only exception i've found to this is the vegetarian nachos, and i'm personally not in the market for restaurant nachos, as I make danker ones at home.  Their burritos are bland, their quesadillas are more like gigantic fried cheese curds, and the ingredients in their salads are of low quality.  I'm giving this a 2 mainly because I reserve my 1's for places that are true hellspawns, but this one is close.  It doesn't help that their service is very meh, and that there's better places nearby for late night Mexican food (See:  Francisco's, Taco Shop).  Here's hoping I can convince my drunk friends to go to those places instead!"}
{"text":"I ordered sopes here it was ok. My boyfriend ordered tacos he loves coming here since I visit him we came here.  But the food it's so so our order took long other than that it was ok nothing awesome..."}
{"text":"Very good chicken enchiladas for this Mexican restaurant that I find has a typical little Mexican restaurant atmosphere.  Very empty when I went at about 5pm, but still welcoming for someone eating on their own.  Of course Mexican soccer on the TV.  Found this through Yelp...thanks y'all."}
{"text":"I had food poisoning after my second time to this restaurant. I had two steak tacos and a pork tostada. Beware."}
{"text":"Margaritas were made with store bought margarita mix. The chips were not fresh and they were out of a bag. There was no free chips/salsa refills. I ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla, and it came out with only cheese and tasted very bland. Service was not only poor, but they were not pleasant. By far he worst \"Mexican\" restaurant I've ever been to, and I will not return."}
{"text":"It is soooo Mexican. I have ever tried different Mexican resturants and this one is the least one I like"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Simple, real, and beautiful. Everything is fresh and authentic, and the service is always great. Their bistec is to die for, especially in their deadly-fried but awesome quesadillas. A little beat-up atmosphere-wise, but the people make it great. The attached market is a nice stop for bringing flavors home with you."}
{"text":"This place makes their tortillas fresh which makes all the difference in the world for the taste.  I ordered the steak fajitas and the boyfriend had some tacos with a gordita.  Neither of us were impressed with the gordita.  The fajitas were good, but the meat was clearly low quality and a over cooked.  However, the tortillas definitely made up for it.  The tacos were delicious.    Service is terrible here.  It seemed like the wait staff didn't have assigned roles and it wasn't clear who was going to take our order, if anybody.  We just ordered as though we were going to carry out and then found our own booth."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying the food is amazing. However, I received the worst service I've ever had in my life tonight (I go out to eat often). The first waitress came over and when we ordered our margaritas, she took our margarita order and proceeded to tell us that \"there were a lot of fake IDs lately\" and looked at us suspiciously. Then she brought us our drink and took our order. Mid order, she screamed at another waitress and said that she would take our order instead. The second waitress was pleasant. While we were waiting, our initial waitress came over as asked us what we ordered and then stormed away. When the food finally came out they didn't bring us everything we had ordered but we couldn't tell them because no one checked on us for the entirety of our meal. When we finally went to pay and get the things taken off of our bill that we didn't receive, our initial waitress was taking a personal phone call while ringing is out. I payed our bill and told her politely that I thought the service was very inappropriate. She was like \"I'm sorry to hear that\" in a very defensive manner. I gave her a funny look and she told her friend on the phone to hold on, and then said \"what do you want me to be a bitch\" and I said \"no I just would appreciate a sincere apology and for you to address my concern and not take personal calls on the job.\" And all she did was scream at me \"goodbye!!goodbye!! I don't care I'm gonna keep on with my personal call!! Goodbye!!\" Needless to say I am calling management tomorrow and expressing my concerns that she made such a bad face for this establishment."}
{"text":"Had just rolled into town. I was starving and craving tacos. I just sort of ended up here. Service was mostly prompt and always friendly. I received chips and salsa and had my drink order taken and filled in no time. However, once I got my dinner I never saw a server again. I had to go up front to ask for my bill. Turns out you pay for it up front (so I was told), but I didn't know that.  I had chicken tacos and a margarita.The tacos were fine. The chicken was a bit dry. If it had been moister then the tacos would have been perfect. The cheese they used was excellent and did not overwhelm the taco.  The margarita was huge and well worth the price (I think 6.50). I couldn't even finish it, but it did a great job of helping me relax and unwind after a long day of travel."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on campus. Hands down. Not even a questionnnnnn. Every single dish I've had has been fresh, flavorful, and not too heavy. The queso blanco they use is amazing--- it's the perfect mix of salty and fluffy. Shredded, tender chicken makes every dish soooo very satisfying! The tacos, gorditas etc. are small and cheap (around $3 each), so you can decide your portion and not have to overpay or take home leftovers if you're not feeling like it! Also, one taco makes the perfect proteinous snack if you're on the run. You order at the counter, so it's no problem getting takeout. Do yourselves a favor and eat here! Let the steamy corn tortillas steal your heart the way they stole mine!"}
{"text":"Second best burrito in Madison, WI to Tex Tubbs. They're HUGE, so don't bother getting sides or anything like that. I always got chicken or beef. It's a very authentic place, easy to walk to if you live in town and I never had a bad experience with their burritos. This was definitely one of my go to places in Madison. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Los Gemelos might finally be the eatery to stick in this East Gilman location that briefly housed one of those forgettable chain calzone joints.  In its place is a colorful yet no-nonsense big city-style taqueria - think Chicago, San Francisco and so on.  Walk up to the counter and put in your order with the friendly female proprietor.  Choose from a full menu of options, including quesadillas, tamales, burritos and so on, or stick with the classic steak, or carne asada, taco, served traditional-style with onion and cilantro.  The tacos come delivered to you, in the late hours, in a paper bag; find your seat, remove and unroll the little bundles of joy and - wait!  Be sure to apply what appears to be house-made salsa (I recommend the green sauce), then enjoy.  For a couple of bucks per taco, you will be hard-pressed to find a tastier, less expensive and higher-quality product in the downtown area, particularly in the post-dinner hours.  On my visit to Los Gemelos, I appreciated the friendly staff who were clearly still working out some of the kinks (the boss lady was trying to get her younger employees to get with the program, and openly \"redirected\" their attentions when they seemed to be lagging on their duties).  The boss also wasn't shy about running a tight ship in the dining room, chiding some college-age kids when they started getting too boisterous and obnoxious - I had to laugh, and I surely appreciated knowing that any drunken rowdiness would have her to contend with.  For this kind of authentic inexpensive Mexican fare, one usually has to travel down to the South Park St. area for Guadalajara or (the, in my opinion, better El Pastor).  Los Gemelos brings quick and tasty Mexican food downtown.  I wish them luck as they develop their fan base and deal with running the tight ship in the heart of studentville."}
{"text":"Fantastic and truly authentic Mexican place right of State St. Eat here and be very happy."}
{"text":"Long wait times.  Chaotic service.  Wrong order received.  Greasy fillings.  This is not the Los Gemelos that I have come to expect (much better quality at their Westside location).  There are enough other options in walking distance (or a short drive) to choose from that I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"Dry, dry, dry is the only thing I can say about this place.  I went with a few friends who loved their meals, but I wasn't entirely thrilled with mine. I had a steak quesadilla which was incredibly bland. The soft shell as somewhat pita-like and warm, which was nice, but when everything is so dry--it lacks in taste.  The only reason this place gets a second star is because the service was good; our waitress generally cared and helped me out because I have a food allergy to onions. Very, very sweet waitress! I'd come back for the service and maybe to try it again, but for now, I'm not entirely keen on it."}
{"text":"We ate dinner on Friday night-wow!  Best chicken tostadas I have ever had! Service was friendly and quite accommodating.  Thank you for such a delicious Mexican meal!  Will be back next time we are in are in Madison.  GO BADGERS!"}
{"text":"The place is kind of dumpy, so I got my food to go. It came in a thin paper bag which quickly developed a hole and allowed grease to leak out onto my clothes.   The quesadillas are not very good; they're mostly breading. Some of their other food is probably good though, especially for the price."}
{"text":"The quesadillas are amazing. Same with their hot sauces. They have specials Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I hear they treat their servers pretty bad, though."}
{"text":"best tacos in town! I wish they had a paper menu for dialing in my carry-out..."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers on the authenticity of the place.  The food looks like the food you get from the Mexican food trucks in LA.  The taste of the food is fairly good.  I got different types of food with different types of meat.  I got a chicken gordita, pastor taco, and steak quesadilla.  Everything but the gordiita was good.  The chicken had no taste and the shell of the gordita didn't have good texture or flavor.  The taco was good because the meat was well-seasoned and you get a lot of it.  The quesadilla is not your normal quesadilla.  It's basically like a cornmeal pita with meat in it and it was the best thing I had.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned and had a crispy friend exterior and a soft warm interior.  Very good!  Overall, a good place to get mexican food.  I'm going to get the chorizo next time."}
{"text":"Great food, and salsas. Terrible service!! It used to be the place I went to often but the past 4 times the employees have been rude and became stingy with salsa.  If you want to dine in or enjoy salsa go to a different Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"People where amazing. I had a good nights in state street and this place was opened late night. The food was amazing. You must try their tacos, biste ala mexicana and their quesadillas."}
{"text":"The food was great. However, I'm a person that is all about the free chips and dip as an appetizer and this place did not make me happy. Two times I've been there they were out of chips. What Mexican place is out of chips!? That's like McDonald's being out of fries.  That is my only concern. Otherwise, great tacos!"}
{"text":"Salsa's offered at DINE IN are the BOMB!  Good heat.  Chips ok.   The Gorditas had lettuce and cheese. The lettuce is what I have always known to be offered in the Tex Mex style not the Mexican style but ok.   Sunday Plato de dia: 2 tacos + rice & beans = $6.99 Monday Plato del dia: 2 gorditas + rice & beans = $7/7.50 Tuesday Plato del dia: Chimichanga + rice, beans & soda = $8/8.50 I forgot the rest."}
{"text":"Some of the best most authentic tacos for a reasonable price in town. I'm a Taqueria Guadalajara kind of girl, but I figured I'd root for this place, too.  I'm also hating that everyone is running on about getting \"sick,\" while eating their food. I've eaten here a million times, the atmosphere inside is very standard, and I see these servers run around while thirty drunk people come in and bum rush the whole place, make a huge mess eating, and leave terrible tips.  You know what, Los Gemelos is good food and that's what matters and I appreciate what they do."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food with very good service.  Neither the food nor the service are perfect, though, so only four stars.  I like the chorizo tacos and the chiles rellenos.  I've found that they never heat the latter enough and it's often not quite melted.  This has been a problem even when I've specifically asked them to heat it longer.  Most of the people who work there are extremely friendly, but there have been one or two exceptions.  In either case, they do a really nice job and are a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"This is the closest to Mexican style tacos I've found in Madison! The homemade salsa roja and salsa verde are incredible! The carne asada and chorizo are exactly what I am used to eating in the Desert Southwest. The cashier was very friendly and the service reasonably quick. There is also ample seating for groups."}
{"text":"Left feeling ill after a dinner with three friends. It was not simple food poisoning; it tasted bad, and the two other compatriots who attended felt worse than I did! We ate an assortment of different foods, indicating that it was not a simple issue of \"don't get beef\" or something along those lines. The staff seemed annoyed at our presence. The atmosphere is ugly. Perhaps it was a bad night for them, but the other two times I attended are effectively wiped from my memory apart from a half-decent horchata."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Madison to get good tacos at. Definitely the cheapest authentic tacos in the area. The food tastes great, the service is quick and friendly, and the bill won't hurt your wallet too bad.  Be sure to try the green salsa!"}
{"text":"Pico de Gallo is really,really good. Extremely fresh and flavorful. I have only eating their chicken and steak fajitas and they both were seasoned awesomely.   However, I do not care for the rice or beans. I wish they would give you the option to cheese black beans and they wouldn't use peas, beans and carrots in their rice. It doesn't taste authentic at all. I think they puree the beans and I am not a fan of the consistency. I am also sure they have pork in them which I do not eat.  It's a quick place to grab a taco. If you have a taste for Mexican, it does the job but I have tasted better."}
{"text":"IMO one of the best Mexican restaurants in town.  Food is great and prices are good.  Their quesadillas are a must, and their sopes are also great.  My only compliant is the attitude of the fat lady behind the counter."}
{"text":"Great salsa. So so chips. From concentrate Jose Cuervo Margarita mix which they forgot to make even though I am the only one at the bar and the restaurant is 2/3 empty at 8pm.  Average thrown together, \"who cares\" style Mexican decor. Haphazard black and white tile dropped ceiling. Random stupid Mexicanish decorations on the wall. Cheap bar counter. Old cheap flat screen tvs. Numerous chunks out of the wall paint. Cheap tables strewn about.  Had the steak and pastor sopes and the chicken gordita. Gordita chicken was dry but the sopes pretty good.  There are 4-5 Mexican places downtown in Madison that I read about on Yelp. I will try another next time I am here, but based on the reviews expect more of the same.  Madison appears desperately in need of a Modern Mexican restaurant like Milagro in St. Louis."}
{"text":"Westside location has better food. (off of Odana)"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food bang for the buck (or should I say peso)  My daughter and I dropped in during the Madison Art Fair on the Square.  We were headed to Chipotle, but after seeing some great Yelp reviews, we diverted off State Street to try this little hole in the wall taqueria on Gilman Street.  Unless you're a big fan of formica, the decor barely rates one star, we're talking dive with a capital D.  The place could use a real thorough cleaning as well.  Our tabletop was a sticky, but with a napkin, some water and a lot of elbow grease, our eating space became acceptable.  The flat screen on the wall featured the Mexican version of MTV which kept my 10 year old very entertained with the plot development of each video.  (Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is sad)   The laminated menu contained primarily Mexican food truck fare (tacos, gorditas, burritos, tostadas, etc.)  As a fan of the late, great Up and In podcast, I was overjoyed to see Boing! as one of the beverage options along with Jarritos and horchata.  But with ala cart prices from $2 to $3 for many of the items, it encouraged us to sample a variety of items.  The cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter was a revelation.  Rather than your standard thin layer of shredded jack cheese pressed between a couple of tortillas, this baby featured a crispy masa pocket crammed full of melted queso fresco cheese.  She quickly wolfed it down and ordered a second one, proclaiming this version to be far superior to what she's consumed at Pasqual's or Chipotle.  I ordered a steak taco, a pork gordita and a chorizo & potato sopes.  The steak taco came in a double corn tortilla topped with finely chopped onions, queso fresco and cilantro.  Unlike the pungent onions that plagued a recent meal at La Mestiza, these onions were fresher and the smaller dice complimented the meaty goodness of this taco.  The steak was well seasoned and perfectly prepared.  The pastor gordita, which had the same masa exterior as the quesadilla was also a culinary delight.  The crispy exterior was a perfect foil to the melt in your mouth goodness of the pork filling.  The chorizo sopes was a solid offering, but it was a little greasy and did not meet my lofty expectations after enjoying the steak and pork offerings.  The basket of chips that we were served were average.  My daughter did not like having to apply the salsa from a squeeze bottle onto the chips.  The salsa was watery and a little bland compared to the other items we enjoyed.  Service was a little chaotic.  The server that took our order was not very attentive (it was a rare occurrence to get water glasses and / or the chip basket refreshed), but halfway through the meal, we were adopted by another server who did a great job.  The total bill with tip was about $20, a great value for the quantity / quality of the food received.  I definitely plan on returning to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to go to Los G's (I don't think people actually call it that but I'm making it a thing).  Get the pork al pastor and chorizo tostadas (they're two different tostadas but maybe if you ask nicely they'll put both meats on one for you?). The chorizo is perfectly crispy and salty and AMAZING and the pastor tostada is a 10 as well. I prefer the tostadas over the tacos because I like the extra \"mmfph\" the crunch gives them.  Seriously, go now. It stays open late enough."}
{"text":"The portions are large, and prices low. The salsa was ok. Service was good. But I did find my chicken tacos a little too bland for my taste. I had them add cilantro to them, and added the table salsa, but still a bit bland. Should've asked for jalapeño perhaps. The frijoles were a tad bit bland too. I had to add the hot sauces to them to eat them. Everything came out nice and hot, which is nice."}
{"text":"By far the best place to get authentic Mexican food on campus. That's not saying a ton considering this is Wisconsin, but Los Gemelos does do a solidly good job on serving consistently good Mexican food.   Upon walking inside, be prepared to be hit in the face with the smell of tortillas (a smell that will linger on your clothes for possibly forever, so maybe don't wear your favorite clothes here or meet up with a date later that night) and some Spanish music bumpin' on the TV screens. You can order take out right up by the counter, or sit down for a menu. The service here isn't great and it's not the cleanest restaurant I've been to, but it's comfortable enough to stay.  Food: Chips/Salsa: Decent. I've definitely had fresher chips in other places with more flavorful salsa, but it's nice that they bring it out to you. Not unlimited though, which is a bummer.   Salsa Verde: YES. SO GOOD. With your meal, they bring out bottles of different kinds of salsas to put on your food and they are incredible.   Fajitas: Comes out on a sizzling hot plate with another plate of veggies, rice, refried brings, and of course some warm corn tortillas! Some of the meat was pretty burnt and greasy, the flavor is good but not anything out-of-this-world, but the whole ensemble was pretty cool to eat and put together.   Tacos: $2.25 each and four different options. Awesome, simple, and served with cilantro and onion for some extra flavor. I do wish they had some specialty taco options though.   If you're around State Street/downtown Madison and have a craving for Mexican food, this is the place to go. Outside of that, I'm not sure I would venture out to try this place out. Food is good but service and ambiance isn't great enough for me to seek it out beyond my cravings."}
{"text":"Great, cheap food on state street. The most authentic Mexican food in town, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. I ordered a taco and a quesadilla. The pastor seasoning was beyond perfection. As for the quesadilla, I am at a loss for words. If you are looking for some tortilla grilles with some shredded cheese, this is not what you are gonna get here. They make their own corn dough and fill it with yummyness of your choice of protein with lots of Oaxaca cheese. The way it is supposed to be! Very authentic Mexican food. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Not that authentic. Taqueria Guadalajara is much better tasting and has similar menu."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Madison. Period. Amazing food and amazing prices. $12 for two full people :)"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times, mixed opinions each time. Chimichangas are really good, I enjoy their tacos as well, and decent enchiladas. However, two dishes I've had, Chile relleno and another that I forgot the name of, weren't too good. Service is okay most days, but I had a bad experience once where I went with a friend, we waited forever for our food (but we were eating chips and talking so we didn't really notice) until she came over and gave us the check and then we told her we didn't get our food yet.   Bottom line: Mostly decent food and mediocre service. Pretty authentic stuff though. I'm sure I'll keep going"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, but the service has gone downhill lately. Really hope they pick up the game."}
{"text":"Decent inexpensive Mexican restaurant. Not particularly special. The food was okay and arrived quickly.  This place will feed you if you are hungry and don't have a lot of money in your pocket."}
{"text":"I had the beef Sope & beef taco. I would say it was mediocre compare to the Californian Mexican restaurant.  Service was also so so, I guess once they give you your food that's the only service you will get."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get \"authentic\" Mexican food near State Street in Madison. The irony there is that I am not a huge fan of authentic Mexican.  The food is exactly what you would expect from a slightly divey Mexican quick service spot. Solid flavors, with the tacos being probably the best item on the menu. The pricing is very reasonable, but I generally will go to places that are a bit more Tex Mex.  But for those of you who are all about authenticity, there are few better options in Madison. Check it out next time you finish your bar crawl!"}
{"text":"I never, in my life, expected the most authentic Mexican food I've had to come from a place in Wisconsin. I grew up in Texas, and you could find stellar Tex-Mex food on every corner, but authentic central Mexican dishes are had to find anywhere I've been.   The moment I bit into my beef quesadillas, folded into that fluffy, crunchy, delicate corn masa shell, the food took me right back to my trip to Guanajuato. My only regret is that I only tried the one dish. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town.  Overall, the atmosphere and service are so-so, but the food is fantastic. Perfect for casual lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"Horchata doesn't get better than this. The consistency of the cinnamon infused rice milk at Los Gemelos is perfection. It's spiced and sugared and oh so good. Many restaurants tend to dull this drink down so it's thin as water and way too sugary. Not Los Gemelos, nuh uh. They do it way right.  Get some tacos while you're here too. The steak variety is served with cilantro and diced onion and is probably best, but I've had chicken a handful of times as well. If you're looking for something a tad heartier, go for the fajitas and prepare for a lot of food. I love that smokey grilled taste on the meat and veggies, nailed it.  Also, they default to corn tortillas here, which is fine by me because they're delish but ask for flour if that's your thing.   Service can be bothersome at times, especially if you're pressed for time, but that can't keep me away from their horchata. I have yet to find a better glass."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food considering good Mexican food in Madison is lacking. I would say the West side version has better food than the downtown restaurant.  The food is a little expensive, but again probably the best Mexican food you can find in downtown Madison.  The tortas, tostadas, and tacos are good. Sometimes the staff is a little crabby."}
{"text":"it was back during my first year as a graduate student and my study budies were hungry after tons of hours studying at Memorial library. It was midnight and most of the libraries were closed. So, we were trying to find a good spot to study and to munch to keep us awake. None of the coffee shops were open so destiny took us to this place. It was obviously not a study spot, but was indeed an affordable and delicious food place. We had some tacos, with a basket of free chips.  That night, we were thankful.   On my next visits, I gotta try some other menus, like chicken quesadillas and tortas with chicken. The latter came in a big portion so I needed a box to go!  their boing was refreshing!  As much as I enjoyed the food here, I was reluctant to give it a four or five star rate, as ehm, they need to work on the cleanliness of the restaurant.  It isn't that dirty, but not clean either."}
{"text":"MINI CHIMICHANGAS!!! Anyways, food is always great. I find it a little expensive compared to establishments they'd compete with, but they're in a prime location on state street so who can blame them? Seriously. Their chimichangas."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, good service. I got the chilaquiles and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Gotta agree with the praise for Los Gemelos. Great $3 sopes, tasty tacos too! All freshly made that should be freshly made. Contento!"}
