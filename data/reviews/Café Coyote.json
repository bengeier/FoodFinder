{"text":"Cafe Coyote is delicious, has large portions, and is spacious with beautiful outdoor seating. The food is well priced with breakfast and lunch specials. The waitress is really pleasant and despite being the only waitress, takes care of everyone perfectly. Overall a great place to eat breakfast or lunch!!!"}
