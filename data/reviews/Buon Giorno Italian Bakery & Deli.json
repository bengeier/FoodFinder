{"text":"Absolutely appalling customer service. Came in to pick up a large catering order and two women behind the counter walked by me for five minutes before helping me even though there was no one else in line. When I was finally helped, the woman who served me was extremely rude. Learn to treat your customers with some respect, especially when they're spending that much money in your store. Disgusted. And food is mediocre at best. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"- spotted this place for Kingston road next to the pizza pizza  - discovered this wonderful Italian deli with a non stop stream of people coming in for sandwiches and other goodies - make sure you grab a canolli.  A must."}
{"text":"I felt like I was part of the family by the time I left.   Stopped in for a quick bite. Had fresh lasagna and a roll with butter. It was delicious. The sauce was just perfect. Prices are so reasonable and I was stuffed! Win-Win.  There are a few tables in there to sit and eat. Brightly lit and very clean. I talked with the family that owns it while I ate. Amazing people! Great food too! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. The pastries, baked goods, sandwiches, and deli meats and cheeses are delicious. My favorite things would have to be the cannolis and the rice balls, although the tirimisu is delicious as well. Definitely a hidden gem in ajax!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert in arancini (rice) balls however the ones i ordered from here weren't that great. It seemed that there was more rice, than meat filling. Not enough tomato sauce either.  On the other hand, you can't go wrong with the canoli's :)"}
{"text":"The cannolis, the cannolis!!!  It's like making love in your mouth.... Okay I'm exaggerating a tad bit, but wow cannolis here are amazing. They were gone in a jiffy!   Great local family run Italian bakery with very welcoming staff. Tons of food, if anything you must walk out with a cannoli."}
{"text":"Without a lot of competition, it's an easy choice, but even if there were 10 other Italian bakeries in the same plaza, I'd still come here. Amazing treats! Every time company's coming, I head here to pick up fresh canoli and biscotti, but go early so there's still some left!"}
{"text":"Many, many years ago this was a favourite place for a veal sandwich.  But they got cheap and started serving a chopped and formed veal that is terrible.  I now go maybe once every three years and get reminded that it still isn't the same."}
{"text":"The orignial is in Toronto - and boy is the Ajax one just as good.  Great sandwiches too.  Excellent desserts and coffee's ....it is VERY busy during the weekends - but I never had to wait - they are very organized.  The desserts are really good European quality - with topnotch ingredients.  I tried their Shrimp Cake and Fish Cake - the cod fish cake we found to be more to our liking.  The Shrimp has a nice hot kick to it - not too hot kind of more like paprika \"hot\".  Its nice having a lovely bakery nearby - the kind you usually find in downtown Toronto - and makes for a good place to pick up goodies if you having guests over.  Good quality Good prices Busy place - but service is fast and efficient Parking lots of it in the mall"}
{"text":"I came by here on a whim (nearby+starving+yelp= my decision. When I came in I was the only one there. The ladies working there were sitting down at a table chatting. When I got in I browsed a bit and settled on a hot sandwich, when one of the ladies suddenly appeared behind the counter (ninja?).   Anyways, I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich. It comes with just sauce and cheese, veggies (peppers, mushrooms, onions extra 50cents). I added peppers. Total came to $7.90. Kinda steep but for homemade, it's worth it.   So I didn't get anything else, just this sandwich and it's okay..., I've definitely had better. For one, the breeding on the chicken had turned to mush, so wasn't crispy, or even soft, it was mushy. Second, not much cheese put on it. And lastly, if I really wanted to enjoy it with not veggies, it would've been a cool $10 which is not worth it to me.   Overall, I'd come here again to try a deli sandwich and their desserts. But that's about it."}
{"text":"One of my secret joys in life is discovering a little, family-run place where the owners' culture seeps into their business.  Here, they speak Italian, carry CDs imported from Italy (hanging over the cash register), and make gigantic jugs of pomodoro spaghetti sauce (which you can buy on its own or made into a meatball or veal sandwich, lasagna, or other treat).  Lasagna is also in the freezer for you to heat at home.  At the deli, the meats and cheeses are plentiful.  You can take some home or they'll make you a sandwich (pick your bread from the freshly baked rolls).  It's a bit of an alimentari, too.  You'll find groceries from Italy along the wall.  Some names familiar, and some not.  My only complaint? That I'd love to shop on a weeknight, but I think they're only open \"late\" on Thursday (I think until 6pm)."}
{"text":"Great hot table for hot sandwich lunches. Great deli meat selection. (Even though I don't like processed deli meats anymore). The homemade hot sauce is to die for. Literally, be careful (but it's so good).  Bought a jar once and it lasted almost a year in our house. Fresh buns and a fabulous desserts, cakes, tarts, etc. A bit above my comfort zone with their price range, but the food is great. Never had a bad veal or chicken from here. (Seriously though, it is just a takeout place, not a restaurant). I guess the have a loyal following. They've been here for a long long time. And they always seem busy. Overall, satisfied. In fact I wish they had an even more expanded selection as I'd  probably go back even more often.  It's authentic as I've ever had. It is what it is and they do it well in my opinion. And I've had Italian."}
