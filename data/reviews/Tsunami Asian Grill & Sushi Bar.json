{"text":"best place to eat sushi in vegas... the decor, specialty drinks and sushi are fabulous.."}
{"text":"I've been here like 3 times, and of everything i've tried, one dish has stood out to me. The 5 spice salt & pepper calamari appetizer! Surprisingly light, i felt NO guilt eating these fried gifts of the food God. I want to try others, but just can't pass up these things!  I've also had the Chili Lime Beef Salad which was perhaps too strong in flavor after having the Calamari. The Crispy Fried Whole Stripe Bass is a little intimidating when it gets to your table. It's literally a whole bass, who is fried stiff, posed as if he was swimming on a hoisin ratatouille pond on your dish.  Even though everyone had a good laugh at my new pal, I was pleased with the order. While the fish looks huge, it didn't feel like it... he was friendly to my belly."}
{"text":"Don't order the sushi here.  At fusion restaurants the quality of preparation and the fish are sacrificed.  This is a prime example.  Order the chicken lettuce wraps, the best I've had, ever."}
{"text":"Susprisingly good considering they had Thai, Japanese and I am sure other Asain cusines all on the same menu.  Or maybe it was the fact that I was with a super hottie that night who distracted me from my meal.  Either way, I left feeling full and happy so I can't complain - price wasn't outrageous either for a place in the Venetian."}
{"text":"5 stars is for the ambiance, the food, and the mood.  Had a great time here.  Ordered a simple rice and orange chicken dish.  They also have sushi here.  Very modern decor and lighting was dark, yet subtle.  Asked my girl to be my girlfriend here, so that may have biased my opinion just a bit.  But now this place will always be a special spot."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this to keep its awesome memory alive and to spit in the face of The Venetian for closing it! I was quite upset to see that Tsunami was closed last time I went to Vegas. This place was great! Great ambiance, great service, great food, and the price was right! Why did they close this place? Probably cause it was the most reasonably priced restaurant at these money hungry casinos. It wasn't super cheap, but it was the price that sushi should be. We had a great time when we were there. It was just another couple and my gf and I but we ate sushi, did some sake bombing and had an overall great experience.  I guess I hope that one day they'll realize their mistake and reopen it.  :("}
{"text":"I'm hungry just thinking about this place. Wow. Its a little hard to find and maybe to get to but in the end, its well worth it. I like this place. A nice change of pace from all the ultra-french in this city."}
{"text":"I'm always weary about eating asian food at modern looking places because through experience I have found that the hole-in-the-wall restaurants have the best tasting food; authentic and flavorful. LV is full of buffets, but my bf and I wanted to go somewhere a bit more relaxing and calm without having to get up all the time to get more food.   Tsunami Grill really surprised me in a good way. Not only is this restaurant located in my favorite hotel in Las Vegas, it serves absolutely delicious food that makes every taste bud on your tongue happy. The mongolian beef dish was spicy and one of the best, if not the best mongolian beef I've ever had. Everything we ordered was fantastic and had absoultely no complaints when we left.   I'm definitely going to try the Tsunami in SF and nsee how it comapres, but next time I'm in LV I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"wow. it's like all asian cuisine mixed together. someone had the korean barbecue bento which was good. i had the ravioli with mango sauce, good too."}
