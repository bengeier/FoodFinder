{"text":"I've been here a few times so finally time to say a little something.  Yogurtland is the best frozen yogurt shop I've been to in Arizona and I've been to a few places, no need for name dropping, but have you noticed they are starting to pop up all over the place like coffee shops.   Like Starbucks, the consistency is always their, perfect. I Love that they have 16 flavors and change it out every other week or so and that they are always cleaning and as far as yogurt shops go they are the friendliest  shop around.   Another thing I find great about Yogurtland is the price.  The cheapest I've found from Chandler to Peoria even out to Surprise 37 cents an ounce. Oh and like someone said before, yes wifi and another bonus, a 3 ounce discount if you bring in your movie stub.  Who does that?  Yogurtland does... I did mention I love frozen yogurt right?  Ok not everything is perfect.  There is only one negative thing I can say, sometimes over the weekend this area is so busy that I can't find parking.    By the way, my rating is a 4.5* not 5* it was not an option but better than a 4*.  Call me old fashioned but there is always room for improvement.  Like my spelling. :-}  HL"}
{"text":"I guess customer feedback worked.  Everything is stocked and they're open until their posted time!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place! I used to walk in any given day and the store would be clean, everything would be stocked and working. Today I came in half the machines were broken and the toppings were almost empty. On top of the limited selection the yogurt we could get was watery. Hopefully they get it back up and running before summer hits."}
{"text":"Delicious as always, but pricey.   If it were a bit cheaper it would earn 5 stars.  $5 on average, like Starbucks."}
{"text":"Last couple of times I have been to this place it was clean and neat love the yogurt and the selections"}
{"text":"We love coming here! It's a good price and they have lots of flavors. Very nice staff as well.  I love the fact that you can take your Harkins movie ticket over there and they give you 3 free ounces!"}
{"text":"I love frozen yogurt, and yogurtland has a nice selection of flavors and toppings. It's clean, the service is fast, and the price is on par with most other places. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that there really is nothing that separates it from another froyo place unless you like specific flavors."}
{"text":"Oh happy days! Love this place!!! Also, if you show your ticket stub from the Harkins Theatre next door, you get 15% off your order!"}
{"text":"Oh lord..where do I begin? So, I have been going to this place off and on for a few years and it has definitely gone downhill QUICKLY. Like just in the past few months.  I went there yesterday with my husband and daughter for a mid-afternoon treat. So.many.problems.   First, getting into line: You get your cup. Fine, no problems there. Next, a cookie divider--I have maybe seen them in the display case ONCE since they came out with the concept. Basically, the case is ALWAYS empty. No cookies, ever.  Then, flavors--good, no problem there.  Get to the toppings...NO SPRINKLES...uh-oh! The girl behind the counter had conveniently disappeared for a few minutes, so we wait so I can ask her about the sprinkles..finally she shows, and I ask if I can have some and she says \"Oh, we don't have any sprinkles\"...no emotion...I say, \"What kind of yogurt place doesn't have SPRINKLES??\" And she just gives me a smirk, nothing else to say. I'm thinking \"greaaaat.\"  So, I move on to my other favorite, yogurt chips...MISSING IN ACTION AS WELL.  :/  So, I'm kinda pissed at this point. BUT--as most people do, I'm assuming--they have POP TARTS  AS A TOPPING...AREN'T YOU GLAD???!!!  So I pay for my PLAIN chocolate milkshake yogurt, and the rest of my family's as well.  Go to sit down, realize I don't have any napkins..go to the water dispenser area (because they don't have any napkin dispensers on the tables for some reason) and there are none. Ok, what is the deal here?  So, I find another girl behind the counter, ask for some napkins...she tells me THEY DON'T HAVE NAPKINS.  Are.you.kidding.me, dude???? She gets a roll of paper towels and lets me grab a giant one off of the roll.  Thanks.  :/  Finish yogurt, my daughter wants to wash her hands and go potty, so we head off to the bathroom.  LOCK ON BATHROOM DOOR--BROKEN.  Yay!  So, hopefully no one comes in while we both have to use the facilities.  (No one did, thank heavens.)  Go to wash hands, NO. PAPER.TOWELS.  Really?  REEEEEAAAALLLLYYY??? I mean, did the girl I asked about the napkins go to the bathroom and get the ONE ROLL they had out of the dispenser? I would laugh if I was reading this and hadn't experienced it myself, but yeah.  Final insult:  The foot-activated trash can:  BROKEN.  Wonderful.  Get me out of this place before I lose my sh*t, PLEASE. Not going back for many months, if ever, at this point.    Yogurtland manager/owner: Please get your stuff together. You are going to lose customers fast, and are, from what I am reading on Yelp.  This place was great once....ONCE."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to go and enjoy refreshing yogurt. Experienced one bad time but other than that it's always great but super busy since movies are right there and stores."}
{"text":"I go here pretty often, I like how they switch out the flavors often, the staff is always friendly. The only dislike is their strawberries are kinda gross at times, like soggy, but sometimes they are okay:) I would recommend to anyone who loves a frozen treat."}
{"text":"Very clean! Nice staff. Great flavors & great prices!:) i highly recommend this yogurt place!!"}
{"text":"16 Flavors.  30 cents per ounce. Tons of toppings, both candy and fresh fruit (I don't know why anyone would want to ruin their dessert by putting fruit on it, but whatever).  It's next to the Harkins Theatre.  Better than Mojo."}
{"text":"This place use to be so clean and my go to place but over time the quality of the yogurt, the staff, the cleanliness of the places I'd going away. The staff is particularly rude, yogurt is all over the tables and the floors, there's tons of toppings spilled on the floor, almost no toppings typo choose from and it's an utter mess now. Extremely disappointed and probably will not be a returning customer.  It looks like a kid is running running this location now."}
{"text":"I wish I had a location closer to my house. I absolutely love Yogurtland. Anything less is dissapointing"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time and never had a problem until recently. The lack of toppings is really a disappointment. Staff is rude and service is extremely slow. Tables are always dirty and the amount of trash build up allows people to not have a place to dump trash. They even stopped serving the free water that they used to serve."}
{"text":"Yogurt good, toppings good, service good. This place is hopping inside & out. My only suggestion especially on the weekends is for God's sakes open up the wallet owner. Have an extra body  to pass out the tasting cups, keep the tables inside & out clean & the chairs orderly. It's impossible to find a chair without asking a table with plethora of them & the tables are too dirty to lean on outside. That is all for now. =0)"}
{"text":"My family and I came for frozen yogurt to celebrate a birthday and with still an hour before closing, all the chairs and tables inside were cleared already and a lot of the flavors were running out. The toppings too were very low. I used to work at a frozen yogurt shop and this was definitely not acceptable. Some people went in and asked if they could eat their yogurt inside and one of the workers said they were closing soon, there was still time to let people enjoy their yogurt indoors. Even though it's late, it's still 103 outside! Please give good service regardless of the hour."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when I come here! I aurally stick to the same flavors, but sometimes I'll venture out and try new ones. The cashier is always cheery and happy and willing to let me try whichever flavor I want without really fussing. I know it can be annoying sometimes to constantly go back up \"can I have another cup I'm sorry\" haha. So I'm glad they are ALWAYS a good sport about it! I try to keep it down to 3 flavors as to not bother. The display on the toppings can sometimes be dirty, BUT what can ya do right? That doesn't bother me of course, it's going o happen with people going in and out all the time! I try to play my part and not make a mess, so it's one less thing for them to worry about!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here when in mood ice cream, the yogurt is much better for ya, so it is a win..loved the looney tunes promotion love tweety"}
{"text":"Love it here.  I've actually been a few times already but this is my first review.  This is by far the best froyo in the west valley followed by Yogurtini, Blue Agave, and Dreamland.  I'd skip the latter and stick with either Yogurtland or Yogurtini.  Good service.  Delicious yogurt.  Nice d√©cor and service.  What more do you need?!"}
{"text":"Flavours are pretty bad nowadays. The place is also a complete trash dump. Yogurt is everywhere and toppings can be found in other toppings and we'll ask in the counter and ground. Trash is everywhere inside the store and outside the store. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I love Yogurtland! They always have awesome flavors and a good selection of toppings. The prices are great and the eating areas are kept clean. Definitely a favorite for a light and sweet dessert!"}
{"text":"Good fro-yo! I got the double cookies and cream but I couldn't taste the cookies nor cream. It was basically chocolate so I had to compensate by overloading it myself with oreos.   I'm not sure if this Yogurtland didn't have a lot of flavors but I was expecting more variety. And the middle lever is to mix the two flavors because it had me and my boyfriend a little perplexed lol."}
{"text":"This place is great! Not only they always have new seasonal flavors that keep a fresh variety, have great toppings AND if you watched a movie that day they give you 3 free ounces for your movie ticket! What could be better?"}
{"text":"Well this was a spur of the moment visit after dinner and really was so much better than I expected!  A word of advise thou, watch how much you put in your cup/bowl as the total unit is weighed (toppings/mixins and all) so it could get pricey!  They had 12+ different flavors of the yogurt and tons of mixin items to make it however you like!  I really did enjoy the Madagascar Vanilla and the Mango Pineapple yogurts."}
{"text":"Come here ever so often but tonight and a couple times recently they have no flavors available. We may come late, like 2 hours before closing but they get busy all the way till close and have no flavors available! It's frustrating great flavors but not if there isn't anything."}
{"text":"Always clean, great selection of flavors & toppings. I enjoy sitting outside and eating my yogurt.   They seem to always be a little busy but there's always an open seat. Friendly staff and quick at checkout. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This place was decently good. Their plain tart is good especially with blueberries. Their toppings were good and filled. Sometimes these yogurt places have a really messy toppings area, making it unappealing. This place has a fairly clean topping area.....although the place was pretty empty when we got there...so that may have kept the toppings neat. It's very pricey at 45 cents per oz. Overall great place for fro-yo."}
{"text":"I have been to this place plenty of times in the past few years and it is a great spot to go and satisfy that SWEET TOOTH we all have (:   They always have great flavor options for your ice cream (frozen yogurt technically but I absolutely disagree with the taste, texture, etc difference that people claim). The really big deal is the amount of toppings you get to put on your ice cream. They have everything from M&Ms and Reese's to stuff like fruits and cereal! You get to do alllll these steps on your own too which is fantastic, which then leads to the weighing of your cup for the check out. You control how much you want, what you want and how much you pay essentially. What more can you ask for?   Pricing: Per ounce you will be getting an awesome deal. This place has absolutely blown away the competition which was a Cold Stone Creamery that was right next door really in the same Harkins Theater complex. I honestly don't even know if they are still in business there anymore lol.   5/5 stars even though they removed my favorite Peanut Butter flavor once for a while! ;'D"}
{"text":"Yogurtland is hands down my fave yogurt and there's about four of them around Phoenix. Here - far west in Avondale, and a few in the east - downtown Scottsdale and in Tempe. There's never an icy texture and the flavors are always spot on. Unfortunately for me, I live in Central Phoenix and it's not exactly convenient to just pop on by for a bite. With that said, there's plenty of froyo around to pick from, and I still think it's worth the drive to Yogurtland every once in a while.   They've usually got a special flavor or two; such as Taro (a fun tasting Pacific Islands fruit), Greek Raspberry and Banana, Pumpkin Pie, or Snowflake Mint. With their special flavors changing every few weeks. Their yogurt, in general, isn't too tart and tends to have more of a creamy flavor than other places, which is why I enjoy them over others.  Grab a sample cup, try them all, mix up your favorites, throw in a topping or two, eat and enjoy. If I'm ever in the area; as I was on this day, I always seem to make time for a \"little\" froyo! ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not the best Yogurt, flavors not spot on or consistent and caramel sauce tastes burned."}
{"text":"I love this location. It is always clean and well stocked. They also have super friendly employees. You can tell that they put alot of work into keeping the store clean.people make complaints of overflowing trash or dirty lobbies probably havent worked in food during peak hours. These guys work every chance they get to make it clean and sometimes there just isnt time to do so when its super busy but they still get it done. Plus they let me use my yelp discount every time. Definitly going to be back :)"}
{"text":"Alot of it has to do with the location, it gets very bust at night and given the customer base- that causes it to be very disheveled and crowded."}
{"text":"Great yogurt, many different flavors and toppings and very cheap.The store is always clean and employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"I am soooo addicted to Yogurtland!!! It is $.39 an oz and so good! There are about 16 or so flavors of frozen yogurt that you can mix yourself. They have an amazing toppings bar with everything you can think of! If I lived closer to this place I would probably be there every night. Love it!"}
{"text":"Mid-day treat.  I really enjoy yogurtland, it is one of my favorite self serve yogurt places. All the flavors at yogurtland are so tasty, like,  Madagascar Vanilla, Dutch chocolate, pistachio, or my favorite Irish Mint Creme.  The staff at yogurtland will always greet you as you enter the store. You can sample any flavor you wish before making your selection.  Then comes the challenging part, deciding what flavor you want, because  they are all so good. In addition to great flavors, yogurtland has a multitude of toppings to choose from.   Yogurtland is  super clean inside,  very colorful decor, and the staff is friendly.   If you like yogurt, you should try yogurtland."}
{"text":"There be some cuties here. The yogurt nice as well  Always nice and clean, customer service on point."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive place to take the kiddos for a little desert action after a movie. Good choices and its located in a good easy to get to spot."}
{"text":"Three cheers for FroYo!    Always a variety of flavors (although I wish they kept Taro around all the time instead of sporadically).   They have flavors ranging from sweet to tart! The toppings are awesome! Mochi, lychee, mandarin oranges, fresh fruit, these little sunflower seed things that I love! They also have typical toppings like chocolate chips, nuts, etc etc ETC! There is no shortage of toppings here.  It is always pretty busy with the movie theater nearby, but it's worth it.  You can catch a movie and bring your ticket stub in for 3 free ounces after the flick.   You might feel overwhelmed with all of the flavors so feel free to ask for a few sample cups! While you enjoy your yogurt, grab a free cup of water, it's usually flavored with fresh fruit!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious frozen yogurt With so many choices! My personal favorites are taro and New York cheesecake. I highly recommend this yogurt shop. but if you're more into sorbets I wouldn't because they usually only have 1 flavor that isn't dairy based."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and offers sample cups.  They have lots of flavors and tons of toppings to choose from.  The place is clean and they offer free water (fresh fruits floating in it).    The teens and tweens we were with LOVES the place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my second favorite yogurt place in the valley.  The yogurt is always the perfect consistency.  They have a ton of flavors and toppings and change them all out regularly.  I hear they had a Red Velvet Cupcake Batter yogurt at one time, but they ran out before I was able to try it - bummer!  Wish they'd bring it back!  My current favorite here is the Chocolate Coconut Truffle - especially good with granola and coconut shavings sprinkled on top."}
{"text":"First time in this place.  Nice staff and the selections were great.  We will go back for sure. Tasty!"}
{"text":"I love the fact they have a variety of yogurt. I love the pistachio the best. I could have rated them as 4 out 5 due to what i noticed that some of their fruit sl8ces are not quality. Some pieces are over ripe. However, as their new costumer, they gave me a coupon that will give me a 5oz free. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I am rewriting this review by choice and not by bribe. I was contacted by the business owner to assure me that my voice was heard. I am glad to see that care is associated with the product."}
{"text":"Yogurtland....my fav place to get froyo. I've tried other spots closer to home, but always come back. The flavors are delicious, the toppings are great, and the employees are always friendly and helpful. I always tell people to hit up Yogurtland, it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"i love this place but not on the weekends. if you want some popular toppings like strawberries I'd suggest going before 5 because they run out on busy nights. its a place worth trying if you haven't already been before and great places to eat around it."}
{"text":"This place was good, and service was friendly.  Their fruit left something to be desired and there wasn't a smoothie option like at Mojo. I definitely will be back at some point but this isn't someplace I'd head to if I wanted something healthy, its more of a sweet spot (plently of sweet flavors, candy add ins etc)  vs. Mojo had both the sweet stuff and a healthier fix covered."}
{"text":"new to the area but great selection of toppings and friendly staff. right next to a Vons so I get to do some grocery shopping while I'm at it. great location. recommend the original tart"}
{"text":"This Yogurt land is busy but the service is friendly, fast, and convenient. The store is clean and you have a variety of toppings and fresh fruit to choose from. They always have their classic yogurt flavors, such as tart and always bringing out new flavors to taste. If you sign up for the text alerts, periodically you will receive discounts for that location. Only gripe that this location does not have outside seats so that I can bring my pooch."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before, but we saw an ad for pumpkin pie yogurt and had a buy one, get one free coupon, so we went to try some. When we walked in, the store looked and smelled clean. We noticed a couple of the yogurt cards were flipped around, thus not available (vanilla and the rocket pop sorbet... my boyfriend was disappointed about that). I got the chocolate milkshake, strawberry, and pumpkin pie. For toppings, I got a few brownie pieces, chocolate caramel cups, a pirouette, gummy bears, and Nilla wafers. Their fruit selection looked very sad (browning grapes, rind visible on pineapple chunks, etc). The cheesecake bites were running low and looked squished. With our coupon, we got out for $3 and change. The pumpkin pie yogurt was fine, but not amazing. The strawberry yogurt was the best. This place is alright, but honestly I prefer Razzleberriez yogurt and Yogurtini's topping selection."}
{"text":"I like the consistency and temperature of their yogurt more than other yogurt places. I wish they had flavors such as Honeydew and Taro. I also wish the crushed their Oreos to pieces. I love animal crackers too lol"}
{"text":"We check their ingredients a while ago and they do not use high fructose corn syrup but recently found out they use mono and diglyceride. Which is like partially hydrogenated oils. They have a lot of option and they are friendly. Would love to give them a 5 star but can't when they use a harmful ingredient that your body can not proccess in their yougurts. Cool place, nice atmosphere, great topping choices and a clean enviroment."}
{"text":"Hello,  Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us in regards to our location in Avondale, AZ.  We would first like to apologize for the experience you had during your visit because at Yogurtland we pride ourselves on Guest Service and exceeding the guest's expectations at all times. We apologize that your expectations were not met during your visit.   We have passed your feedback on to the Regional Operations Manager as well as the Franchise Owner and Manager so they are able to work with the staff at the location to ensure these types of incidents do not happen in the future. The Franchise owner decided to have a company party for their employees this holiday season but are trained to respectfully update their hours on their website.  Interesting that in a letter to the company about hours and sanitation; they choose to only respond to the Holiday Hours challenge.  For employees to see patrons standing outside, then come to the door laughing and not acknowledging any of us was completely rude.  The place has gone down in months.  Flavors being out, dirty trays, empty fillings, and childish staff has really made us unhappy as a family."}
{"text":"I like the ice cream flavors better than Menchies (though we enjoy both places). I got coconut, banana toffee pie, and rocky road. All were good! My 3 year old got guava & strawberry, and I loved the guava! My 9 year old got strawberry and original tart. Surprisingly, we really enjoyed the latter. It really does taste like actual frozen yogurt. And my middle child is still saying its the \"best I've cream place ever\"! Lol. Its small in here, but spacious enough to move around."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Frozen Yogurt?! This location is great because it is right next to the Harkins Theatre in Avondale. Since there are so many people coming in and out of the movie theatre, the line can get a bit long, but it does move quickly. They have a lot of flavors and great toppings. They are regularly clean and have pretty good customer service. It's a great snack before, during, or after a flick!"}
{"text":"This Summer's 2013 promotional flavors: Looney Tunes.  Get them while they last.    Bug's Bunny: Carrot Cake - quite delicious and true to the real cake Daffy Duck: Dark Chocolate Orange - for me, it's okay. it's an interesting blend but just doesn't float with me  So far, that's all I had for the promo flavors.  I know Marvin the Martian is coming out next but will try soon.  I'm trying to collect all the character spoons, I only have Bugs thus far.  If you downloaded the Yogurtland app, scan the character flavors to earn some free froyo on your next visit.    This store seems to always be busy since its near a movie theater as well as other fast foods and restaurants.  You can't go wrong here, Yogurtland is the king of froyo."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Quality is always consistent and if they are low on a topping they're happy to refill it for you!  I work a couple of doors down so I'm here often.  Friendly staff!"}
