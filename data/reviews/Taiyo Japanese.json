{"text":"the place is clean and the food is pretty good. It's not all you can eat so it got pretty pricey. Though the meal for 4 for my family was more than enough. The chicken wings and salad idk what it's called was amazing"}
{"text":"This restaurant is right by my house, so I decided to try it out since I love sushi! The restaurant itself is very nice and modern and the service was good. 

I got a variety of different rolls, gyoza, and some udon soup. They don't have all you can eat here, so it can get a bit pricey! The rolls however were very big, so they fill you up! I like my gyoza pretty crispy and the server told me they couldn't do that, so that was a little disappointing! The food though was all good with fresh tasting ingredients. 

I would come back since it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy going here, but our last experience was our last. 

Ordered veggie tempura, among other items.  When the tempura came, I noticed that most of the yam and japanese squash pieces were bite size. No bigger than my thumb, and that may even be generous. The squash looked rotten, so I flagged down the server. After explaining what I had noticed she said sh would take the plate to the kitchen to see what was wrong. 5 min later she brings out the same plate with the same 9.5 pieces of rotten temura! She said, \"the chef says there is nothing wrong with the food\" and procedes to walk away. Whoa. When she brought us our other food I told her I didn't think it was right, and let her know we would not eat the tempura. She shrugged and did not seem to care. Got our bill, and of course, we were charged for the rotten food. Too bad to see this place go so far downhill so fast. 

Horrible service, rotten food, disappointing recovery = Taiyo."}
{"text":"Yes, finally a Sushi Restaurant north of 64th Avenue north.  They are located across from Rona in Creekside this brand new location is just what the surrounding communities needed in the Sushi department.  We have been driving all the way down to Kensington in the past three years to get our Sushi fix so this addition to our local dining is very welcome.  My wife and I dined there with our two year old and it was a very pleasant experience.  The ambience is nice and includes a few classic Japanese style booths along with your regular booths and tables.  We ordered the Bento Box's and they were tasty and fresh.  The salad included the traditional ginger dressing, the miso had substance, the saki sushi (salmon) was fresh.  The ginger pork could have used some crispness and the gyoza was more pastry-like than is commonly served, but overall the food quality and flavour was excellent.  The service was also attentive and friendly including being very accomodating to our two year old with additional avacodo slices.  He enjoyed sitting in the Japanese booth and bopping to the background music.  We went around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and replaced another family and saw one other take out order, so please add to their clientelle and visit Taiyo to keep good Sushi alive in north Calgary."}
{"text":"Check this place out my friends! This place serves the best food \"affordable\" money can buy. Waiting time is reasonable, you get friendly service, food servings are more than the usual and it's clean. Even though the dining area is small, people come back for the food. Appetizers are priced perfectly - 6 to 11 dollar range. My fav is the calamari (ika karaage) and Tako yaki! I don't often make reviews but when I do, its because it has caught my attention."}
{"text":"Yum! Finally we have found a sushi place in the NE that is delicious!

The service was so fast! I couldn't believe it. Our nigiri was the first thing to come, and it was delicious, the thickest salmon I've ever seen served. It was at least 50% bigger than other places I've been to. The sashimi was the same thick slices of fresh salmon. Their rainbow roll was heavenly, it had a cajun shrimp in it and was the best I've had. The salmon roll was average, not as much salmon as I was expecting after some of the other rolls. House special was delicious, usually I don't order the 4 piece ones because they are awkward to eat, but this one was worth it. Maki ranges from 5 + and their special rolls are 12+. We went a bit nuts and the bill proved it. Dragon roll was good, too. 

Geez, I could go back right now!  

Decor was clean and inviting. Nice space between tables, I didn't feel like we were eating with the people across from us. I loved that the sushi chefs at the back greeted us and said thank you at the end, despite being very busy."}
{"text":"Our neighbourhood sushi joint. 

We love it here. The staff are not only our neighbours but they are super friendly and willing to go the extra mile for you. They work extremely hard and are talented in their craft. Ask Jimmy and Lee to make you something unique and they will (the owners).

Everything from the rolls, sashimi, Tako yaki, soups, tempura and green tea ice cream! Everything in here is delicious. 

Did I mention everything is very reasonably priced? Sushi is expensive in this town but Taiyo finds a good balance in this area."}
{"text":"I've visited twice, and both times weren't exactly positive experiences.
In terms of food, everything tasted okay by all means, but everything was a little on the bland side--flavours didn't really pop (and weirdly enough all the food looks... kind of pale?), but for fair-priced sushi and appetizers, I was honestly satisfied with what I paid for.

My real issue was with the service.  Maybe during both trips the staff were just having bad days, but I was astounded by how blunt the servers were--the worst of it was on my second visit.  My group was welcomed in politely and halfway through eating, were asked if everything was okay, which so far it was, but when it came time to pay everything became so much more confusing than it needed to be.  The server seemed irritated that we wanted to split the bill according to what we'd each ordered and bluntly asked us how we wanted to round our payments--as someone on the shyer side, I was almost intimidated by her attitude.  We all ended up getting confused and pooled the money in a mess, which left them a bigger tip than we realized--which, after the fact, we had decided was hardly deserved.  I believe in the system of speaking with your wallet--anytime I have a bad experience, I still thank staff and leave quietly, and then promise myself not to come back, as was unfortunately the case here."}
{"text":"I live 2 minutes away from Taiyo so I gave it a shot.  I was skeptical at first because I didn't think this place will be any good especially when it's in the boonies but I was pleasantly surprised.  The sashimi was fresh which was extremely important and their rolls were tasty.  The decor is still quite new.  It's clean and modern looking with booths and such.  I would recommend this place if you're in the NW and do not wanting to drive far for decent sushi.  The pricing is a bit steep but it's sushi so expect to pay a bit more."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant. Great service. I had sushi combo B and sake maki. I honestly expected crappy sushi, considering the location and the menu choice, but it was one of the freshest sushi i ever had in Calgary. Tuna melted on my mouth, salmon had perfect texture and prawn was very flavorful. Will return for sure and would recommend."}
{"text":"The good: nice variety of Japanese fare, friendly staff with prompt service. Had take away from them twice, both times under promised and over delivered on speed of food. The preparations and presentation are decent, nothing over or underwhelming.

The bad: prices are prohibitively expensive to become a consistent dining option. For better or for worse, these guys are 10 to 15% more expensive than some of the best places in Calgary (globe fish). I too echo the sentiments of some of the other reviews as it related to freshness of the food but for the most part, my second visit was better that the first. Their hours are very weird too and no website which is extraordinarily strange in this day and age. menus have items crossed out with sharpie and prices changed with Bic pen. It's actually sad and humourous at the same time.

The verdict: for a weekend sushi fix, this place fills the void barely slightly edging out the take away sushi from the creek side co-op."}
{"text":"Move in Kincora Area two months ago. I' noticed this restaurant while were doing some shopping at Rona for my newly build house. Came to Taiyo Japanese Restaurant with my two  children on last friday to support a local eatery business. Cound not get a table since restaurant was full. I waited at the front and notice three sushi chefs with head banada said out lound greeting to customers walking in, even they seemed very busy. Cudo for this friendly place! While i were waiting to get a table, a cute waitress brought us miso soup and friendly asked if i like to wait for a while. Wow,, another Cudo. 
Got the table , ordered diner for four combo which is $61.00 included Salad, Miso, Beef + Chicken Teriyaki, chicken Wings, huge plater of sushi, and 3 ice cream for my family ( my wife did not go on that day :( , she is not a fan of raw fish  :(.  The food and sushi were good, i like it and so were my children. Kudo for the food!  Tax + tip , we paid $68.00 for a lovely dinner for my family ( 1 adult, 2 young children at 14ysrs and 15yrs) at taiyo , plus some left over food to pack home . Another Cudo for  reasonable price!  

Will come back and recommend for family living around this NW area to try this newly Japanese Restaurant ! 
 @Adrian b??? are you kidding,,, their menu have a nice design.. + the restaurant menu (thetaiyo.com) appears on their menu and the big front window as well!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened, we were stoked that there was finally a sushi place nearby. We dined here twice and both times were disappointing, even friends who had tried it weren't fans. Because of that, I haven't been back.

Recently my sister had her wisdom teeth pulled and had a hankering for soup. Not wanting canned soup, she suggested picking up some udon from Taiyo.

We arrived around dinner time and I was surprised at how busy it was considering it was a week night. We grabbed a take-out menu and scanned it over. Some of the prices were crossed out and marked up in pen - a bit unprofessional in my opinion. If you're going to up the prices, at least opt to re-print your menus. My sister ordered the chicken udon and tako yaki, paid up and waited. I guess we should have asked how long it was going to be because we sat there for 25 mins before her order was brought out.

For about $16, she actually got a lot of food. I didn't try the tako yaki (not a fan of octopus) but there was more than enough udon to fill us both. The broth was flavored nicely, there were fresh veggies and teriyaki chicken and the noodles were a good consistency (not gummy or way too soft)

Would I be back? Maybe for more udon, but I think my heart will always be set on Kinjo for sushi."}
{"text":"Fast, convenient, and decent food. The staff are quick and friendly. Great for a Wednesday night meal."}
{"text":"Food here is very good!  Building is a little small but very close to home!  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Very good good, good service as well. The young Chinese waiter made an attempt to speak Japanese to us (my spouse is from Japan). Will be returning in the future, possibly with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Large portions! Great service!
Reasonable Price! Clean and Contemporary.
The Best Little Japanese Restaurant in Calgary! 
LOVE it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not acceptable at all.  I am sorry but I have standards.  
Where should I start?
The service was so-so.  It wasn't good, wasn't bad but it wasn't the kinda of service I expect for a restaurant that was not busy on a Saturday night. Their service definitely did not win me over since their food was terrible!
We ordered quite a bit for a party of four, mainly because their portion is half of the size of what I normally order for the same price.  With that being said, I personally found it as a ripped off.  One of the dishes we ordered was a Rainbow Roll, which only came in 6 pieces (half of the size of what a normal rainbow roll from other Japanese restaurant).  It would be fine if it was good, but unfortunately it wasn't (at least not to me). 
Oh and get this, you would think appetizer is something comes first before the main dish, but ours did not.  It came in the middle of the main dishes.  This is the order we got our food: Rainbow roll, Spider roll, Ika Yaki (grilled squid), Seafood Tempura, another sushi roll which I don't recall what it was and last but not least, unagi don which by the way I didn't know it serves COLD????  
Needless to say, it was a great disappointment.  I am sorry but I would not want to come back and give this another chance.  It's just not even worth another chance at all....not even when at the end the chef gave us four tiny little complementary salmon rolls."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi eater, but this place had lots of options for someone who wants meat. The veggie tempura was really good with huge pieces, and my husband enjoyed some sushi, though said the pieces are bigger at globefish, but the prices are better here. The Ginger pork was really great, and we had a tasty beef appetizer, can't remember what it was called...served raw. The service was pretty good, though we had two waitresses who didn't seem to know they were both waiting on us. Also, the food came out at odd times, the timing wasn't great. Overall though, very good and we will go back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi restaurant! The customers service is impeccable- Staff are so happy to help and accommodate all food allergies, switching out anything if need be. The sushi is incredibly fresh and delicious, I recommend the creek rolls and salmon nigiri."}
{"text":"Very good value for good food. I have tried their lunch and dinner menu and I'm always satisfied in every visit.

I love their lunch combo with miso soup and salad. It's a bento box thats very filling and just costs  $12+. I tried their vegetable ramen and beef ramen, it's perfect to warm you up this fall/winter season. The serving of the ramen is big enough to share for two! If the other person ordered another dish to share you'll feel super full already! 

Their dinner menu is also good though the combo of soup/salad/sushi is not available for dinner anymore.

This is my Japanese spot and I'm so glad it's just 10 mins walk from my house! My go to for Japanese craving!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Japanese restaurant. food was aright.. We were a big group and we all ordered different food. Their menu have some good stuff : Udon, sushi, karage and other japanese favorite dish. I found food to be aright. Price is reasonable so you get good portion for what you pay.  Staff are very friendly and approachable."}
{"text":"I live in the area and was excited to see a Japanese restaurant opening up. I have tried this place on numerous occasions and it has been a disappointment. 
I have been there during peak times and non and it continues to disappoint.
The price is more expensive compared to dome amazing sushi places in the city and the food is not up to par for the price you pay. The portions are small. I find the selection to be lacking. I have to order two meals to be full. Came with my 3 yr old daughter and husband... We ordered a salmon don, chicken udon, a three hand cone special and a couple of rolls. The bill came to about $100. Definitely not the price worth paying for the quality of food.
The service is lukewarm. This place definitely does not stand out. You will probably get the same quality at Co-op at the other end of the strip mall."}
{"text":"Being a small Japanese restaurant I thought it would be one of those friendly neighborhood places that delivers excellent customer service. Let me tell you, what a DISAPPOINTMENT. When we got there my bf asked nicely if we could sit in the non-tatami styled booths and before the guy at the front could answer this girl just said bluntly \"you can't sit there it's all full\" in the rudest tone ever without even looking at us. I was slightly irritated and eventually we were seated. Our server took forever to come to greet us and by greeting I meant we got the coldest condescending tone ever. Everytime my bf said \"can we get ...\" She would answer with this bitch tone \"uh huh...\" And if we asked her a question she just seemed really annoyed. The entire time she did not smile once. I mean excuse me, did we do anything to piss you off to deserve this treatment? If you are having a bad day that still doesn't give you the right to treat your customers like this! If you think maybe she just has a resting bitch face you are wrong. What made me mad even more was that she would then turn around and have a nice smiling conversation with this group of Caucasian customers in the next table. I read one of the reviews that complained about the servers being racist but I don't understand being Asian herself why on earth would she be racist to fellow Asians? I was having a nice date dinner with my bf and this turned out to be a rather negative experience. The food was quite good so we decided to just order takeout in the future if we must eat here again. This way we can avoid the unnecessary bad service and paying tips to someone undeserving."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, but a great atmosphere. I went there with some of my friends and we all had a great time. Seats were really comfy, you know how they have mats in Japan when they eat? It appears to look like that for some of the tables but they actually have leg room underneath  the table which I thought was pretty cool. The food there was delicious and depending on what you ordered was well priced. If you order a lot of the fancier sushi like Tiger or Dragon rolls then your bill will add up but if you order one of the lunch specials and an order of California or Dynamite rolls then you will end up extremely satisfied for under $20. The only problem that I had was with the chopsticks,  they have wooden chopsticks that come in a paper wrapper but they felt weird in my hand. If you go to Edo and use those chopsticks they feel average,  they are the standard.  But the chopsticks here felt a bit cheaper. Overall it was a great experience and the only downside was with my slight nitpicking about the chopsticks. I also strongly recommended to go on a week day around lunch because they are less busy and I'm not sure how it is on the weekends."}
{"text":"Local sushi in Symons area. 

Staff super friendly and menu well balance of hot and cold Japanese food. 

There are dinner combos for 2 or 4 people and priced nicely with a good mix of sushi, apps, soups, salad, meat and ice cream. Good for first time sushi eaters. 

Dining area is small with seating up to 35-50 people max. 

Lots of take out action and there is a sushi bar with a few stools. 

Very clean restaurant and recommend if you in surrounding area. 

On the pricy side but most sushi restaurants are in YYC."}
{"text":"I only go every now and then because it's close. The servers are high-strung and not friendly. One or two of them will ask \"how's everything?\" but boy there's this one server that has awful service. The sashimi is nothing compared to Zipang or Roku but their ramen is delicious!"}
{"text":"The best I've had in Calgary. Fresh and well made/presented. Prices are about right for the great quality. The spider roll is out of this world! 

The location obviously isn't very central but I will go back whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"Just moved into Kincora and thought I'd give it a shot. I was very pleased!! Nice and modern with friendly staff. Shared 6 different rolls with a friend and that was way too much food! Spicy tuna was my fave. I will be back for sure. Price wise it's about $25/ person so fairly normal for sushi."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the sushi, Udon and Beef rice bowl tonight.  It was all decent.  When I went to pick it up the guy that helped me was friendly and talkative, that was a nice change from the short cold service you receive in some places now a days.  We will probably get takeout from here again.  It's nice to have another option in the area."}
