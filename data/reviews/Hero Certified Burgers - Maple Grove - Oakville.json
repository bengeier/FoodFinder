{"text":"Great little place in Maplegrove mall.  The lunch crew is super friendly and nice.  Knows many customers by sight and greets them personally.  Made it real special for a chain.

The burgers are not bad and they have a cool new fountain dispenser offering many (109+) drink options.

Come back to this location over the other two in town."}
{"text":"The official hamburger of the Toronto Make-beliefs.  And to put this chain on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo.  Ha.  I will eat no hero burgers.  Ooh. Ahh."}
{"text":"Since mgmt too over this place has deteriorated in zero customer service & terrible quality food! 

Avoid this location at all costs unless you want all night bathroom visits! My daughter & I ate there & was sick all night! Contacted mgmt & zero response! Maybe they are too busy sponsoring the leafs because customer service isn't as an exciting of a priority! 

Too many burger options to ever go back to Heros again! 

Try Hwy55 on Trafalgar S of QEW - awesome burgers + much better burgers at The Works in downtown Oakville, or South Street Burgers just west of this location! Or even Harpers Landing! Boycott Hero Burgers! 

One star rating only because I had to too! Zero stars is more appropriate!"}
{"text":"After corporate staff took over, and in their transition, to new staff, their fries and their burgers are horribly made. I gave them two chances and they failed both times. I ordered a 6oz burger combo take out. By the time I got to my car, the burger was \"luke warm\" almost cold. The fries were not cooked like before. Miss the Indian lady who ran that shop. I wont' be going back. I'm going to South Street instead."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Hero Burgers, but the staff at this one are extra friendly and even remember your usual if you're a regular.  Four stars because Hero Burgers generally don't taste as good as some of their competitors, it's like they're missing an ingredient."}
