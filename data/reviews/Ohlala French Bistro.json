{"text":"Excellent meal! Great little bistro with a very French vibe. Made reservations for 7:00 on a week night. We were seated right away. The owner, Richard, was great. Discussed our time in France with him and he made recommendations for our meal.   Started with the cheese, honey and pistachio tartine and a meat and cheese platter. Baguette was perfect! Cheeses were fresh and tasty. Sausage was very flavorful.   Next we had the salad lyonnaise. Easily my favorite French salad with onions and bacon. Dressing and egg were done perfectly.   For entrees, my wife had the special which was similar to a potato au gratin dish. Very rich, very cheesy. It was served with small salad to break up the heaviness. I had the lamb which was seasoned perfectly but just a tad over cooked. I ordered it medium rare but it was probably medium. The carrots and potatoes served with it were excellent. We also had the fried zucchini which had a very fresh taste but was just a touch under seasoned.   Dessert was the chocolate mousse with a touch of orange. Super smooth and silky with just a hint of orange.   Overall a very good experience. Richard was fun to talk to and food was great! They probably need one more person to help with service but this place is fantastic. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sweet little neighborhood French bistro. Personable service, relaxed atmosphere. Menu is classic French standbys."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious.  Cozy restaurant. Staff was very professional, quick, and friendly:)"}
{"text":"Great little French restaurant!  Abby,  our waitress , was great and explained everything on the menu.  Everything is homemade- even the bread,  which was delicious."}
{"text":"We just discovered this small, intimate restaurant recommended highly by friends.  We will continue to go back as we thought it was great.  We enjoyed the special lunch menu and will look forward to trying many more items on the full menu.  The service was lovely and the staff very attentive.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Food and pricing are not matching with the web page offers.  Was not what we were expected. Dinner menu has few choices only. Reading the rest of the reviews looks like we were in a different place - no beautiful bottle of water, no butter; Jambon de Paris was not what we expected; the fries were salty we rush to get out. Honestly we liked the bread and the wine. Sorry we are not coming back."}
{"text":"Wow! What an unexpected gem! The service is outstanding. Quality is at the forefront, as the owner is always present to ensure the best possible experience. Over and above when it comes to service, food and wine!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the food both times has been excellent. We had the charcuterie plate and steak  tartare which maybe the best in town.  I am glad to see they have some new specials especially Petrale sole which is going to be a permanent menu item. I had the muscles but I tried the Petrale  sole and it was the best, worth conning back for.  We had a Bordeaux with the meal and it was a fair price. Great place for locals!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! We travel to France often and this is the most authentic French food we have found in Las Vegas in 7 years. This is BISTRO fare, not haute cuisine, and the style is more southern (Provençal). The prices are very reasonable, and the wine list offers a good selection of well-priced French and domestic wines."}
{"text":"We had a really delicious dinner, and everyone in the restaurant was incredibly sweet. It was a great experience, and we are excited to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant (apparently not on Trip Advisor yet), so we took a chance.  So glad we did!!  The owner Richard is absolutely charming, and the food was wonderful.  Had a wonderful evening with my husband, great food and good wine, followed by a fabulous dessert and dessert wine.  Then I went back 2 nights later with some work friends.  We had the melted goat cheese appetizer which was to die-for yummy, then we had mussels (loved them! -- ask for extra french bread to soak up all the sauce) -- I tried the ones in the white wine sauce. My husband had the filet, which he said was good.  With my friends, one had the mussels, and the other had the prawns, which she said were delicious.  I tried the pasta with salmon.  It was very good but also very rich with the cream sauce. We shared a side of the zucchini which we all agreed was about the best preparation we'd ever had. For dessert we shared the chocolate mousse, which was excellent.  It is also very rich, so perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"A terrific new restaurant Food and service perfect Quality wine list Owner Richard is from the Toulon region Hauls from a restaurant family well known in North Beach San Francisco"}
{"text":"Great service.  The pistachio crusted honey goat cheese was warm, creamy and delicious.  It was a heavenly bite with warm crusted French bread.    My filet mignon was grilled rare to perfection. The meat was tender and flavorful.  My husband's pan roasted salmon was tender and juicy. We loved our dinner.    We ended our meal with an espresso and a rich chocolate mousse with candied Orange shavings.  Phenomenal dessert."}
{"text":"We loved every bite.  Absolutely amazing.  Compliments to the chef!!! Freddy & Katrina"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing !! Love the small restaurant feel, and the owner coming to the table to check up on you. The must haves are the baked Bree, the goat cheese, and the tar tar. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch. French background music, casually elegant bistro decor, very affordable prices, most attentive server and super convenient Summerlin location. My friend's escargot and chèvre were fine, but my spicy lamb sausage and beautiful bib lettuce salad are what led to my rating this a five star lunch. Will be back to try the numerous other menu choices that sounded delish."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous new restaurant! French bistro at it's best. The steak, \"shepard's pie\", beet salad, and French onion soup were amazing....and the chocolatemousw... Spectacular! I look forward to going back. The service and personal graciousness from owners were a nice touch too. Prices and wine selection were a welcome surprise. French restaurants are often expensive, but this bistro was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best French restaurant in Vegas. The food is amazing, the price is affordable, and the staff is friendly and attentive (waitress Abbie is the best!)."}
{"text":"Wonderful frog legs, fantastic lamb! The tartare was tasty. Service was very good and accommodating. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend. The service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive. The bread was crispy and the butter was very creamy. We got the Le France charcuterie plate (the only weak link here was the Parisian ham, which to me isn't really charcuterie...) ($15), the pistachio goat cheese appetizer ($9), the French onion soup ($6.50), the endive salad ($10) and the Moules Poulette ($19). We also got a free tiramisu for checking in on Yelp. Overall, everything was very reasonably priced. The flavors were excellent. Everything was very well-prepared. They even kindly split the endive salad onto two plates for us. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So glad to have discovered this intimate French restaurant at the corner of Lake Mead & Rampart.  The hosts/managers/servers were very accommodating to the family, bringing out a pasta dish for the kid when our appetizers arrived.    Service was both friendly & timely. The host checked back in with the little one throughout the meal, asking how she liked it, saying he knows children will be honest about the food.  Haha!  We had a couple cheese appetizers.  The food was amazing.  Pistachio goat cheese & the baked Brie made for a great combination to start.  One had a roasted garlic side.  So yummy.  Had a burger for my entree, also with Brie, bacon, and onions.  Great flavors, & along with the gratin potato side made for a perfectly balanced meal.  Of course there's an excellent wine menu to choose from as well.  Will have to partake next time.  Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Absolutely excellent food. I can't justify enough how much this place exceeded my expectations.  Tastebuds are officially happy!!  We got the stuffed dates, which were so delicious!  The seared salmon with carrot purée and also the carbonara were so good I wish I could eat there everyday!!  Anything on the menu will be satisfying. Trust me."}
{"text":"This is just what this area needed. ..a delicious,  moderate restaurant with excellent food at a moderate price. The Baked Brie was a small portion but came w crusty bread, roasted garlic & a little  arugala. I had the L'naise salad. Incredibly fresh with large bits of bacon, fried onions & a poached egg. The winner of the evening were the mussels...so tender they melted in your mouth in a very light cream sauce that begged to be dipped in that delicious bread . Great service,  a good wine pour ...this is a must!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to The Bistro we found it to be very comfortable and inviting although it is small it's very cozy. Our waiter was pleasant tentative and very informative. The food was to our liking the snails had plenty of sauce for dipping the tartar was creamy and the pickles gave a perfect crunch. The muscles are from Prince Edward Island they were prepared in an excellent wine sauce. Will definitely order them the next time we're there."}
{"text":"Great French food with fabulous service! The filet mignon, escargot, and beef tartare were delicious."}
{"text":"Truly a lovely dining experience for me and my daughter!  We love to try different restaurants, especially close to home.  Not a fan of driving to the Strip on a Friday nite.  We had reservations for 6:00 p.m. on Friday, Feb 3rd.  Our waiter, Nino helped us select a bottle of red wine...excellent choice, which went very well with everything we ordered.  The brie and garlic tartine, dates, and French onion soup were delicious appetizers, and we were almost full after that, but we just had to share an entrée.  The owner, Richard, recommended the mussels, which were tender, sweet, with just enough broth to dip your bread in.  By that time we were savoring all the flavors dancing around in our mouth, but of course, we had to order dessert too.  We ordered the Tiramisu to go.  The restaurant is small and quaint.  I'm so glad we made reservations because every table was full when we left. The service was excellent.  Richard even gave us a hug when we left and thanked us for coming.  We will definitely go back and try other things on the menu, and also anxious to try the Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"On the way out from starbucks with an empty stomach, you glance at the menu on the glass wal from the french restaurant next door. On the background, there's an aesthetic chandelier upon the bar and variety of wines on the container. There are people-mostly couples- with smiles on their face, like they just got engaged near the Eiffel tower shines its bright and romantic beams. You enter the restaurant and the dark, private atmosphere surrounds you. Trying to pronounce the french menu just makes you cringe a little. As an American, skipping the small talk and going straight to entrees is a norm and proud of it very much. Bavette à L'echalotte's medium steak with the scent of red wine enlightens your tongue like a french revolution. There's no extraordinary experience as this you can find in Summerlin. Later in life, you find yourself counting on here as a special dinner place, an exclamation point!, for your next important dates. Memorable places filled with memorable taste stay within the core memory of your relationships with people that you had dinner together here."}
{"text":"Amazingly wonderful food. Husband and I had onion soup, escargot, shrimp skewers on frise with fantastic dressing, mussels, flank steak and of course French fries.  Also a bottle of wine. Wonderful, fresh food and good french bread at reasonable prices. Fantastic service. Very reasonable prices for wine. Desserts sounded good, but too full.  The owner is interested in serving the community please support them. We need mom and pop restaurants, not only corporate ones"}
{"text":"You can definitely  find French taste here !!!! The food was delicious and the staff is extremely nice :-)  We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem of a resturant.  The servers and the owner were very attentive to our needs.   The food was all simply prepared, delicious, and well priced. Great little French bistro."}
{"text":"Delicious food ,love the steak tartar , great onion jam on the sausage sandwich. Out of the way a bit but I be. A regular for sure."}
{"text":"So happy to have a French bistro, with real French food, at an affordable price in this town! Real authentic French dishes, with fine products, exactly what you would get in some of the best Parisian bistros. The owner, Richard, takes good care of his customers and seems to have no other satisfaction than to see them enjoy each bite. The pistachio goat cheese is to die for, loved the bacon mussels (moules Poulettes), and still craving for the chocolate mousse. Can't wait to go back ! Thank you Ohlala!!"}
{"text":"The menu is great.   Fancy but casual.  You know... French.    The steak was not so great, and we had them do a redo on our escargots- meh. We don't drink wine for the most part so good food is very important.   All in all we had about 6 menu items and everything else was fine.   There were a couple take out orders and three other tables when we arrived at 5:30pm, can't wait to stop back in and try something else"}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever. This new restaurant is great! Nino is wonderful and the food is amazing. Some of the best tasting french food I've ever had. Good prices, too. Will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Finally someone (owner Richard) that understands that French food doesn't always have to mean complicated, \"shi-shi\" and expensive. The food is simple, authentic classic French. It lacks in pretention (which is great) and delivers precisely what it promises. (I bet you won't find a Sous Vide machine in that kitchen! thank god.) It's moderately priced for French food and while you are not going to get a Guy Savoie meal there, it's also not trying to sell itself as one just because it's \"French\". The décor and atmosphere are great.  They also offer a nice wine selection and staff seems well trained and knowledgeable enough. The owner Richard is as friendly as can be. He pays personal attention to every single table in the dining room and much like the food he serves, his personality is without unnecessary pretention.  For instance, the Steak Au Poivre is always great and has that wonderful \"crust\" without compromising the perfect inside temperature and doneness. Better than what you get in some fancy expensive steakhouses in this town.  Having said all that - I did take one star off and here's why: It's wonderful that the concept is simple and authentic. However, even simple food should be prepared with attention to details and the best ingredients. I find that there is still room for improvement on those levels. Example: The cheese platter. The simplest thing to \"prepare\", as no cooking is involved. It's success relies entirely on the quality of products you put on the platter. Not all of the cheeses offered there deserve to be on that plate. Same thing goes for their charcuterie platter. Overall, some dishes suffered form being under salted and some were over salted. (and some were perfect - but they should all always be perfectly seasoned). Perhaps with just a little more training and attention to details and quality control of ingredients, they could rise higher and I'll gladly give them that 5th star."}
{"text":"Hubby and I popped in here the other night without reservations and with light appetites, and ended up happy, full, and pleasantly surprised.  Hubby had already eaten dinner, his way of waiting while I got my nails done, so I was at a loss for what to choose for dinner. I have a light appetite and it's not easy to find good adult food in children's meal portions. I decided that I wanted deviled eggs and did a Yelp search, and found this previously unknown spot that has deviled eggs. Once I read the appetizer menu to Hubby, wheels were turning and we were on our way.  We were seated promptly, without reservations, a mistake that I'll try to avoid in the future. While they managed to fit in a lot of seating in a small space, I'm going to assume that reservations will keep us from sitting next to the front door and getting chilled every time someone exited/entered. This place got packed quickly, which meant a lot of shivers and food shielding in last night's chilly breeze.  Hubby wanted to try a few items, and the prices are positively cheap (except the Coke, but I'll get back to that), so we ordered 3 appetizers.   First, the deviled eggs... very creamy and quite excellent, needed only a light touch of salt. Second, escargot. Mistakenly served without toast, server blip (also for later), but tasty once we had that. A bit on the chewy side, but still good. Without that deficiency, would have been great. Probably won't order again. Thirdly, beef tartare. Served with too little toast (blip time again, also corrected) but very good. Different from others we have had in that it was strong with the taste of pickles and the beef taste was overpowered. It was yummy, but would be more accurately named pickle & beef spread. We still ate every bit of it.  Lastly, our split entree of Pasta Carbonara.. excellent! Incredibly creamy and well-balanced, a refreshing change from the usual canned alfredo+egg sauce that others claim to be carbonara. (You'd never guess my depth of hatred for the standard Alfredo sauce and its imitators. A proliferation of bad taste doesn't equal good taste). Anyway, back to this dish... we were both stuffed by this point, and yet we were ready to lick our plates. Yummy!  Now, about the Coke price. Yes, I realize this is a wine restaurant. Probably an excellent wine restaurant, based on the quantities of wine we saw the other customers downing. However, punishing non drinkers with a $3 charge for a can of Coke is ridiculous. Charging that for a fountain drink would have been even worse, thank you for not adding that indignity. Yes, I know that these high fees for a cheap product has become the industry standard, but that's not going to make me like it. Pet peeve, sorry.  As for the \"blip\", our waitress apparently had an asthma attack and was laying down in the back while she waited for her boyfriend to rush her forgotten inhaler to her. We understand and forgive, and we're very impressed with how much everyone else scrambled to cover an entirely packed restaurant.   Speaking of the staff, absolutely everyone was gracious and charming. Everyone I could see was happy and smiling, they charmed a packed restaurant into satisfied patience. I even saw a cranky toddler charmed into smiling.  Based on that night's dinner, we will be returning and it will be soon. Next time, though, I'll make reservations and an extra sweater, just in case."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant find!  Great traditional french cuisine.  A fabulous wine list.  Reasonable prices.  Great service.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those amazing finds that you want to tell the whole world about (but want to really keep it a secret because once the word is out...it'll be hard to get a table) Nino is a super personable, charismatic server, and Richard is a very charming, gregarious owner appropriately proud of his jewel of a restaurant!! Kudos, guys...we'll be back with reserves...SOON!!...mercí c:"}
{"text":"Outstanding & Amazing & Wonderful !!! Carefully selected wine list, reasonably priced. Intimate atmosphere. Superb entrees."}
{"text":"What can I say? I never would have imagined that a French bistro would make the best frog legs in Las Vegas! Tried several appetizers and they were all delicious. I will be certainly back for more food experience"}
{"text":"Great authentic French food very reasonably priced Excellent service. Everything we tried was terrific. The pistachio crusted goat cheese is to die for. A rare find off the Strip"}
{"text":"Best French bread and cured butter in Summerlin. And personally, I prefer the filet mignon here over any steak house. And: no hassle, no waiting and no pompous waiters."}
{"text":"Once again Oh La La delivers gourmet dining but at a reasonable price. A must have is the Endive salad.   The texture and taste is perfect. The lamb chops were prepared perfectly with yummy accompanied dipping sauce. The tiramisu melts in your mouth and the serving size could be for two   The owner is also the executive chef and the staff is friendly and efficient. The owner visits your table to make sure you are satisfied. Each plate is cooked to order. They have a nice selection of wine. I highly recommend Oh La La if you want a nice evening with great food."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Best French fries and onion soup, great service, and cute ambience. Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"It isn't hard to find a \"French bistro\" style restaurant in this town, but it's not as common to find one frequented by actual French customers. My guy and I came in for dinner and were some of the only folks here who weren't fluently conversing with the owners. We tried several menu items and they were fairly good but unfortunately nothing left us clamoring for more. Perhaps I'm just used to Americanized takes on French dishes though.  The highlight is definitely the homemade bread, which was frequently and cheerfully replenished. The French onion soup is made with a vegetable broth for a more subtle flavor- perhaps serving this in a deeper bowl with thinner crostini would yield more of actual onions, which were meltingly delicious. The escargots and mussels seemed thrown together; the onions and garlic used in both dishes was barely cooked and the sauces did not have a developed flavor. The beef tartare and baked brie were okay, but the execution lacked finesse, like individual ingredients put on a plate together rather than cohesive dishes. My guy said he really liked the contrast of the creme caramel dessert paired with his espresso, and the pricing is very reasonable. We stuck to dishes we're familiar with and were surprised that we weren't more impressed, but will likely be making trips back for lunch tartines or dinner entrees.  The attentive service and beautiful location make this a good date-night spot. They appear to have a happy hour for drink specials, and most other diners were enjoying a glass or bottle of wine. Per management, they will be introducing a brunch menu within the next month!"}
{"text":"Great French food in a beautiful room--OhLaLa is the real deal. Service was excellent, wines were good, and every dish we tried was delicious. We enjoyed it a great deal."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here last night.   Staff was attentive and caring.  All of our food selections were delicious.  Charcuterie was delicious as well as tartar.  Main coarse burger tender and juicy with Brie was yummy frittes my daughter loved.  Flank steak needed a Touch of salt and the shallot sauce a nice compliment.  Lamb was tasty as well as PEI mussels.  Wine list is nice and reasonably priced!!   Desserts......  tiramisu one of the best I have ever had and crime brûlée was also stellar.  The owner also treated us to a dessert appertif.   This dessert wine was amazing.   Great little gem right around the corner."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is here!  Tiny place, no ambiance, French soup was served cold,  not one authentic French chef, cook, bar tender, or hostess!!   Won't be back!!  Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And great service! The waitress took the time to really describe the specials which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"Delicious French food, especially for the price. They're not afraid to get creative with their specials and offer many classics on the regular menu. Not pretentious like many French restaurants.  Started with the cold zucchini soup with herb and garlic goat cheese and dash of pistachios, which was on special that day. Hard dish to pull off, but the pistachios pulled it together, offering a salty roasted crunch in a light cold soup.  Beet salad followed, topped with mandarin oranges, goat cheese, and drizzled with vinaigrette. Nice light salad perfect for a hot day.  Chose the Moules Marinieres for the entree. Healthy portion, not over cooked, and great taste.  Finished with an espresso and Tiramisu. Nothing to write home about, but it was done well and satisfied the sweet tooth.  4 course meal, with wine and espresso. Out the door for $60 - not bad."}
{"text":"Oh la la is the best. We had gone to another restaurant and left extremely dissatisfied. We were hoping Richard would be able to get us in on a busy Saturday night without a reservation.  Within a short time he had us seated. As always, the food was exceptional and the service superb. We left happy and content."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Ordered a traditional ham/cheese omelet and the quiche. Special ordered the omelet from 3 eggs to 2 eggs. The omelet was light and perfection. The quiche was perfection. Ordered the potato galette, which was rich in garlic and onion with a crisp crust. Richard, the owner/chef provided the most excellent reminder of France. The staff was attentive. An excellent experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Was excited to have another French bistro in the neighborhood. Didn't meet expectations. The appetizers: the salad with fromage de chevre was very oily. Les escargots were chewy and lacked flavor. For the main course: the sole was good but had to pluck the lemon from the water to give it the final touch it needed. The moules poulette were cooked properly but the sauce was sweet and reminiscent of some kind of salad dressing. The moules marinieres were also cooked properly but the base was over saturated in shallots. The pommes frites, weren't. They were like potato sticks. For dessert, the chocolat Liegois was wonderful. The server was miffed until the end of the meal. I would recommend coming for cafe and dessert."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant by accident....delicious! Everything is made in house! Friendly staff and delicious food!!!! Truly French!....."}
{"text":"Finally a french bistro that won't cost you your entire salary. Price are very reasonable, quality is amazing, it's feel like your eating in the champs elyse in Paris. You will love that place.  The Moules and also croque monsieur are amazing, I will for sure go back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place.  The first time that I went here they were still open on Mondays (they no longer are), and it was quite full at 5 pm.  We got the baked brie as an appetizer.  I had the sole meuniere, and my fiance got the salmon pasta.  The sole was amazing! So light and buttery. The salmon pasta was quite good even though I don't care for salmon.  This is when I know a place is special--when I don't care for something and it's good there, we are on to something.  We also got the tiramisu and chocolate mousse for dessert.  Immediate I got, \"But I don't really like tiramisu.\" Buy when he tried it, he thought it was the best one he had had-- although he has not had many.  It definitely was a bit of a twist on the original but again very light and not too sweet. The mousse was fantastic and had bits of orange in it. Our wines were solid.  The staff was very patient was the non-wine drinkers of the party and even came back to ask if it was okay or if they would like something else. This place is truly something special.  I have been back since and have had the Cornish hen and the moules marinieres.  Both are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ohlala is a very tasteful restaurant both menu and interior atmospherically-wise.  I got the escargot and flat steak redwine with shoe string fries. The steak was a little bit chewy but cooked perfectly medium rare, and the redwine sauce was not bad. The shoe string fries that accompanies the dish is really good has a good crisp to it.  The escargot is probably the best part, and for 9 bucks is a really good deal. The snail is cooked nicely in butter garlic and parsley and comes with 9 pieces and bruschetta bites and soft butter. The problem with most escargot though is that over cooked can make it chewy and some might taste a little gamey. Fortunately though the escargot here was awesome, and had no gamey flavor that I noticed.  We also got the flan as a free dessert option which had a really good flavor but was a little bit too firm than I usually preferred, still you can't argue with free dessert.   Oh and did I mention the bathrooms? When you walk in you are surrounded by mirrors on all walls giving you a very sky high Yayoi Kusama installation feel. I swear it was like I was peeing in the aftermath of obliteration of eternity haha. Definitely a cool bathroom.  When I find the food and price is right, I know i'll be back to try them again."}
{"text":"Great food and price too!  Decor here is cute . It reminds me of those small cafes you find out in France .The owner and employees are very nice love the hospitality. Overall I would definitely go here again and also bring some friends here too!"}
{"text":"\"When you learn to accept instead of expect, you'll have fewer disappointments.\"   I was excited to check out Ohlala French Bistro. I'm a fan of Big Horn Olive Oil Company, where on a recent visit I saw and heard good things from another patron about Ohlala. Ohlala French Bistro is a local neighborhood kind-of-spot...one where the owner and servers care about the guests that come in and desire to connect to the clientele. We enjoyed our interaction with the owner very much and the food was a perfect 3 out of 5 stars, precisely A-OK.  We took the opportunity to try their Warm Crusted Pistachio Goat Cheese, Moules Mariniere, Large Beef Tartare, and Carmel Flan.   The standout item for us was the Warm Crusted Pistachio Goat Cheese. This baked cheese dish is warming to the body and taste buds. The honey and onion confit jam caramelize nicely and add a sweetness with balanced savory aspects that work well with the goat cheese. The Moules Mariniere was the healthiest 1 lb. portion I have seen in a long while. The broth was not as robust as others I am accustomed to. In fact it required that you used the salted French Fries that come with the dish to maintain an adequate level of flavor. This could have been the Chef's intention, but adding salt at the end in this way limits the potential and flexibility of the dish. The large portion of the Beef Tartare was in fact large. It is done in what I understand to be a French style where the meat is ground as opposed to the chopped filet versions we more commonly see in the US. This style will probably through some patrons for a loop, while others will be fine with it. The flavors were good with capers, mustard, shallot, and pickles coming through nicely. Finally, we shared a Carmel Flan...free with a Yelp Check-in and the purchase of an entrée."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say about my experience  here . As soon as I walked in the place was so nice and inviting and the service 5 star all day. And I really liked how the owner interacted and had good conversation with us. It really meant a lot and the food wow I had the salmon it was perfect nice and moist inside and crispy outside. With great flavor. My son had the salmon pasta and just as good the pasta cooked to perfection with great flavor. And my wife had the mussels wow great flavor and the  mussels were cooked to perfection. We will be back I will recommend  this place to everyone."}
{"text":"A nice and quaint place tucked in an office complex. Very attentive staff. Abbey was sweet and prompt to our requests. Food was delicious. We both chose the appetizers from the daily specials and I had the fois gras, and my husband had the dates stuffed with Gorgonzola and wrapped in prosciutto. They both were delicious. As entrees I had the Moules Marinieres. It was perfect for my cravings. My hubby picked Hachis Parmentier and enjoyed it to the last bite. To finish the meal we shared a chocolate mousse which was creamy and just right sweetness. Overall our evening was a very pleasant experience and Ohlala did a wonderful job to add to it."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic. What a delightful atmosphere, delicious food and terrific wait staff. In fact, I think the chef serves too, if necessary. We have never been to this place when it wasn't packed. Try the salmon, the lamb, the pistachio encrusted goat cheese. Order a bottle of hand-picked wine from around the world. Try the hand-made desserts. I promise, you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Food was so fresh and delicious went for late lunch. Nice atmosphere. Great service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Magnifique!  Great food, attentive staff, reasonably priced............................................"}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews, I was ready for some steak and frites. Fortunately for me, OFB is just a few minutes away from my home. It is right next to a Starbucks in a small mall. I was confused for a second, because the Starbucks drive through wraps around the whole building and was thinking, \"They have a drive through?\" :)  Walking through the door, OFB did a great job using a small space. It has a nice little bar, a few tables well spaced out, and well decorated. It was a full house, so I grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bartender (who I think is the owner) was very nice and took my order of the Bavette a L'echalotte. While I was waiting, they brought out a baguette and butter. It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The Bavette a L'echalotte was okay. I had asked for medium, but it was served well done. The steak was also quite small. It was seasoned well, but just overcooked and not much of it. The shallot sauce it came with was great, and the frites were good too.  For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse which was rich and creamy.  Overall, it was okay but was hoping for more. I'm not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Had flank streak last night. Very good. Onion soup was  also great as was dessert. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night without a reservation and found a spot at the bar. If you want a table, definitely make a reservation as the bistro is small. The owner walked us through the specials followed by a tour of the French and California wine list. He even gave us a few to sample to help make our selections. It was clear he took such pride in the food and wines, even telling us which wines were from his region in France and which he had personally saught out. He brought out three rounds of bread (heavenly) and butter while we waited for our meal - though it was a much longer wait than other restaurants for our food, the ambiance was so great and chatting with the owner didnt make the wait seem long at all. My filet mignion with a creamy sauce was delicious! I couldnt find a single thing on the menu that I DIDNT want though, so I will definitely be back to work my way through it starting with the mussels! Definitely save room for dessert - his grandmother's tiramisu recipe is out of this world! Overall, we stayed for 3.5 hours and enjoyed every moment. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A Desert Shores highlight bravely touting tartare on the menu as well as a wide range of French delicacies on both the lunch and dinner menus. One of the owners tracked me down at the Starbucks next door to hand me my to go order. I've also had dinner there with a couple who were also equally impressed. Excellent food, superior service, and truly exquisite ambiance in the most unlikely of locations. Tres bon! I shall return! Merci!"}
{"text":"This is a very good little French restaurant, based on our one visit to it.  It has stylish decor with a lot of black and white and glass, sprucing up the otherwise typical location in a bland shopping centre, which is the setting for almost all places in this city, at least outside of the Strip and downtown areas.  Service was very good, friendly and attentive.  There seems to be a strong emphasis on fresh and good-quality ingredients to the extent possible - obviously this is not a good region for lots of fresh local (or farm-to-table) ingredients and that is going to be something of a limitation.  The food is apparently all home-made, portions are good-sized and reasonably priced.  Roasted beet salad and filet mignon with peppercorn sauce were excellent."}
{"text":"Oh MY GOSH Oh La La c est SO GOOD! Forget about the French restaurants on the Strip, this is a real French Gastronomy! From the atmosphere, the decor, the music everything about this Bistro is Beautifully Elegant and Chic  Even their bathroom! I just loved all the details.  The owner was very friendly. He checked on all his clients to make sure they were happy with their order. Talking to him you can tell how passionate he is about sharing the Authentic French Cuisine at decent price compare to the strip!!  Yes it's truly how we eat in France at a Bistro, smaller portion are served so you can enjoy your meal without feeling that you over ate unless you order the whole menu like us  We ordered the Mushroom creamy soup (so so tasty, owner grand ma recipe), Onion soup (my husband favorite), the appetizer size of the Steak Tartare (raw so don't expect the tartare to be cooked) it was very well prepared and perfectly spiced, frog legs in a buttery garlic sauce (no oh la la guys it taste like chicken!), the goat cheese with pistachio in a sweet onion confit was delicious! Our entrees were Grilled Prawns on a frisée salad, Bavette a l'échalote with some very good fries and a wine reduction sauce, Hachis Parmentier (you guys call it  Shepherd Pie) We ordered a bottle of red wine and let the Owner choose for us He picked a full bodied wine and we enjoyed the full bottle with our succulent diner  No room for desert  so we ordered a chocolate mousse that we shared. It was melting in our mouth and the candied orange in it just made it amazing! BON APPÉTIT!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular - I could eat here every day. Can't decide which is better, the food or the service! 10 Stars!"}
{"text":"Super new French restaurant!   Had an amazing salad and mussels in a fantastic sauce."}
{"text":"We had escargot, frog legs, French onion soup, Cornish hen and flank steak (bavette).  Nothing was good, not well seasoned, no flavor.  My wife spoke to someone and he said they don't use salt.  Adding salt to the cooked food did not help.  I took two bottles of 1995 Bordeaux wine to enjoy with a friend from out of town.  Paid $50 to drink my own wine.  Some of the worst French Bistro food we have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant in so many regards.  Six of us went on a Sunday night and appreciated the warm welcome from the owner, casual elegance, and quiet where we could actually hear one another.  Then the food!  One in our group is a caterer and declared it \"fabulous\".  The moules frites and steak frites transported us to a bistro in France.  We all had different items and everyone was ecstatic about the food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Franchement quand je vois des avis négatifs au sujet de ce restaurant surtout venant de gens qui comprennent rien à la gastronomie quand on regarde de plus près leur profils... Bref... C'est un super bistro nous y sommes allés 2 fois avec mon épouse et nous y avons très bien mangé, le patron est très sympathique, les plats sont goûteux et les prix raisonnables... Allez y les yeux fermés !!! Nous, nous y retourneront !  (PS le pain est le meilleur que j'ai mangé pour l'instant aux états unis)"}
{"text":"Always amazing food and amazing service at this place! One of our favorite Las Vegas restaurants! If you do a check in, you can also get an amazing dessert for free!"}
{"text":"Great addition to summerlin. Good experience, especially for a new restaurant. Hopefully with time the wine list will expand."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. The salmon pasta is amazing. Along with everything else! The chef recently sent my table a creme brule and it was better than anything"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new finds...Right next door to a Starbucks! I've been hearing about this place for quite some time now and as French bistros go it really is top-notch ! My friends and I had an excellent lunch there they had already been there previously for dinner and were raving about it! Very reasonable prices and a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered last night was delicious. Warm goat cheese- will order it every time we go!  The Le Royal charcuterie board had a great selection of meats- the duck was delicious. The pate was rich and enjoyable. The endive salad was a great size to share. The candied walnuts were perfect in the salad.  We finished it off with a shared bowl of mussels. Broth was perfect."}
{"text":"Happy to finally find a nice French bistro off the Strip. Easy to park just in front of the venue and reasonable prices of course compared to the Las Vegas Boulevard...  Located on a small plaza near Starbucks this place is composed of around 40 seats and a nice bar. The decor is simple and cosy with a nice view on a windowed cave with all their wine selection. Mostly French but not only.  Richard, the French owner, greets you when you come in and take you to your table. He always make you feel very welcome and at home.  The menu is everything you can expect from a French bistro : - platers with selections of cheese and/or charcuterie - escargots cooked in a perseillade butter - French onion soup topped with Gruyère cheese - Beef bavette with shallots  - Slow cooked lamb - Pasta alla carbonara - Beef tartare...  The 4 of us ordered a mix and match plater to start with and a nice bottle of french Rosé. It was composed with Gruyère cheese slices and Brie for the cheesy side and Rosette de Lyon and Saucisson sec for the deli side that are all French specialty. Than we shared the goat cheese malted with caramelized onions, pistachio and honey that is my really favorite of all the dishes they offer. So much flavor and nice combination.   Had the endive salad with candied walnuts with a nice dressing. My friends had the hachis parmentier (beef with mashed potatoes au gratin), the moules marinières (cooked in white wine and shallots) with skinny crispy French fries, the special of the day that was Boudin noir (black bloody sausage with mashed potatoes and roasted apple). Everybody loved their food.  We tried all the deserts : Tiramisu, crème caramel and zesty orange mousse au chocolat. Fab !  I will return to try more stuff as soon as I have the opportunity."}
{"text":"A taste of Paris in Northwest Vegas!!! Excellent quality...the specials this night of Sole and Octopus Carpaccio were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch.  Lunch prices are reasonably regardless, but I opted for the $14 lunch special that combined a sandwich or salad with an appetizer or dessert.  I had the tuna sandwich and a salad.  The salad was remarkably huge.  Pretty basic with greens and onion, but the dressing was great and the dish a good starter.  The egg sandwich had some delectable bread and tasty anchovies which complimented the bread to no end.  They even served complimentary baguette to begin a meal, very rare at lunch.  Service was heavy but not intrusive at all.  I will surely be back for their Happy Hour which offers wine and charcuterie, or even for dinner to try some authentic French food at an affordable price. Ohlala is a must in this area."}
{"text":"Oh La La is exactly what Las Vegas needs - a French restaurant that feels like home, where you feel comfortable coming in to eat delicious food on a regular basis. Service was impeccable and friendly. Pellegrino with lime was served upon being seated. Olive oil & herb bread came shortly thereafter. My hubby ordered French onion soup which tasted homemade. My salad with encrusted goat cheese was the perfect combo of tangy, fresh & savory. Hubby had the steak with frites, which came with an onion jam to die for. I had the French version of shepherds pie, very filling and seasoned nicely. Richard, the owner, sent out a crock of warmed goat cheese with caramelized onions & honey. I will be dreaming about coming back for that dish, as well as for the tiramisu, seriously the best tiramisu I've ever had. Richard recommended our wine, which comes from the region in France near Provence where he was born. Great recommendation!  We will be back!  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wonderful French dining. Kudos to the chef everything was delicious. And the dessert yummy!!!"}
{"text":"A true and unique French restaurant in Las Vegas. The food was excellent and the manager/owner is super friendly. You can finally enjoy real French food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant but it has a lot of heart. The service was phenomenal and I could tell that the staff are very proud of what they have to offer.  I loved the warm pistachio goat cheese and the endive salad. The complimentary bread and butter are excellent as well.   What really made this place stand out to me was the excellent flavors and very reasonable portions/prices. French places can be more pricey, but the menu here is tasty and prices extremely reasonable given the quantity and quality.  If it weren't so far from my home as Ohlala is in Summerlin, I would come more often!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Started coming to Las Vegas regularly when a good friend moved here and we always make it a point to come here once or twice for brunch. The French toast is absolutely delicious, as are the eggs Benedict and the omelettes. So good! Will definitely keep returning. This is neighborhood gem that we hope lasts forever here :)"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic food in an unassuming spot with remarkably elegant decor. Love everything on the menu and have made this a \"must\" stop when in LV. Handy it's so close to the kid and grandkid.  Merci Richard for continuing your legacy of excellence!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner yesterday. The restaurant is small but cozy and the ambiance is quaint and modern.  Our server is Nino and he was super attentive and friendly.  We ordered a glass of red and a white wine. The white wine is Cleebourg Riesling Vin d' alsace, it was enticing and paired well with my food. Bread and butter were brought to the table. For starters, we had one of their specials which was Blood Sausage with mashed potatoes and it was well-prepared. For entree, we had the Lamb Brochette which is marinated lamb in garlic and rosemary with roasted potatoes. The flavors were delectable and we wanted the lamb medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I am still dreaming about the heavenly rich Chocolate Mousse we had for desert. We both ate all of it and enjoyed every moment."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch, wonderful ambiance,  fantastic service, easy convenient location. French Onion soup was perfect. Prawns/salad had a perfect seasoning on the prawns and a reduced Balsamic vinegar dressing. My friend had an unusual salad that was decadent. French coffee was as good as the crusty, French bread/butter. I can't wait to return--five more dishes to try."}
{"text":"Here first for lunch, then recently dinner. Both meals have been trés bon. We have savored the onion soup (a big hit with my husband), the escargot, quiche with brie, beet salad, butter lettuce salad, mussels poulette (a new preparation to me - I will have to try the marinere to see which I like best) and duck breast with asparagus and poached peach. Cafe Americano was delicious. The only disappointment to our palates was the créme brûlée. We appreciated the attention given by Chef/Owner Richard (one of our tablemates is from France which engendered the usual bonhomie) and the service par excellence from Anthony. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have now eaten here a total of 5 times. The pros inexpensive for French cooking.  Great bread, fine service, good owner, authentic food.  The cons very noisy,long wait for entrees, very small portions, which is how the French do serve food.  Also the salads are overdressed and the wine is very expensive.  The decor is ugly."}
{"text":"J'ai aimé la carte, j'ai aimé mon repas, personnel accueillant, restaurant sobre, c'est sympa, je recommande ce restaurant."}
{"text":"On the recommendation from a friend, I tried Ohlala for lunch with a business associate. Most impressive. Delightful menu, excellent preparation & presentation, friendly staff and delicious taste. European portions keep it real. Nice wine list too. Delighted to know such a pleasant taste of France is available without all the froo-froo."}
{"text":"Cute place in summerlin with decent prices. Great service, clean bathrooms (important after a long drive.) most importantly they were great with our baby/ toddler. Food was delicious and priced well.  Baguette and butter- good quality, delicious, hard to resist.   Beef tar tar - strong mustard taste- but good  Baked goat cheese with pistachio and onion jam- so so so so so delicious. Like your plate clean delicious.   Steak bavette - perfectly cooked at medium rare and thin crispy delicious fries.   Side of zucchini - didn't expect much but was delicious.  Lamb- I am a bad judge of lamb since I'm general I am not a fan. Tasted like lamb which I personally don't like the taste of."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had tartines with salmon and French onion soup. Everything was delicious. The onions in the soup weren't over cooked and slimy and the toasted bread was crisp on the outside but easy to chew through. Very impressed with the quality of food. Met the owner and he was friendly and explained the menu items to me. The inside is themed and decorated, like a proper restaurant should be. Very happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Cute little place run by French owner. Had the goat cheese salad and steak with poivre verte sauce . Both were good - sauce for steak could've been a little better. Crème brûlé needs help - shell on top was rubbery not hard and crisp . Great service"}
{"text":"our new favorite. great food,well priced and very authentic.  owner very evident to insure great service."}
{"text":"Heavenly. Mom and I had a decadent lunch. This place is amazing- Mom, who is a very classy well- traveled lady loved it as much as I did. Please do yourself a favor and go. Great service- Abby was awesome. Great memory. This place was really impressive."}
{"text":"The restaurant have a great design and ambiance. Richard the owner is super friendly and took really good care of us. We tried: oignon soup / escargot and the bavette and everything was delicious. We will definitely back"}
{"text":"My first visit to Ohlala French Bistro in Summerlin exceeded my high expectations.  The atmosphere is very inviting and the service was helpful and friendly.  The salad with butter lettuce, bacon, and poached egg was one of the best I've ever had. The mussels were plentiful and tasty. The lunch was awesome and worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Superbe meal.  Incredible choices of very authentic French cuisine. Enjoyed the moules (mussels), escargot, and blood pudding. Fantastic evening.  Good wine choices as well."}
{"text":"Oh my!!! Went for my birthday last night.  This place is AMAZING!!! The owner came by several times to ask how everything was.  It was just AMAZING.  I felt almost like I was back in France.  Pricing is great food SPECTACULAR....service...STELLAR.  Love this place so much I would wanna work there.  Just AMAZING!!! Thank you Abby you made my birthday just fantastic"}
{"text":"Many people toss around the term French Bistro, without really paying much attention of what are they talking about. This is the first real  authentic French Bistro in Las Vegas. You can find simple food the same way you find it at the corner bistro in France. It is a tasty, simple cuisine you enjoy with friends around a bottle of wine. When I want Japanase food , I like to go in a restaurant where the Japanese eat. If I want French food, I like to eat at Holala because so far it is where the Las Vegas French community eat. Since I eat a Plant base diet, the Chef prepare me a plate of sautéed zucchini with basil and garlic.. thank you Chef, I am a satisfied customer and I will be back. Vive la France !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite French restaurant.  High quality yet reasonably priced food, great service and great wine list.  My favorite entrée is the Hachis Parmentier, which is like a French version of shepherd's pie.  Lunches are really good too.  And love the French baguettes!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food. Definitely a great place for a date."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Summerlin area!!! Staff and service is spot on!!! Go fir the food and amazing wine but come back again fir the Tiramisu !!! Wow"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with work friends for lunch.  Excellent service and value.  Everyone was happy with their food and the ambiance is great. They are getting busy at lunch so you might want to make reservations.  They have an extensive, hand selected Italian wine list."}
{"text":"Oooohlala!! I've never been to France so I can't judge on authenticity. But WOW! The food tastes amazing at this cozy French bistro. The staff has a French accent and the decor is simple but elegant."}
{"text":"Amazing new French restaurant in Las Vegas! Nice place, awesome people, delicious food! What else? :)"}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat authentic French food... Large menu for everybody, the food is homemade, ambiance and decoration just perfect ! The owners are French and all the staff very friendly. Easy to find between Rampart and Lake Mead, large parking... I recommend this restaurant..."}
{"text":"Good Sunday brunch.  Liked the Mussels with French fries and also the steak entree.  Good service, however, the owner who is present, is selective on whom he checks up on about the food and whom he thanks, and clearly ignores other customers -- and this is why we probably are not inclined to return."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best French restaurant in town.  We started with French Onion Soup...A little anemic, as the broth was vegetable stock... NOT beef as we're used to. Followed by escargot... Which needed a little bit more seasoning... All of which was very nice... The entrees were fabulous!   My wife had the Jumbo Prawns and loved them.  I had the Sole Meuniere, it was simply to die for!  I used to live in France and hadn't had Sole like this in over 50 years... This is truly authentic. Truly a dish made in heaven!! DECADENT! No matter which French restaurant I'd eaten at in the USA... It just didn't compare... We've tried all the French places in Las Vegas. Sadly, none stood out like this place... Very AUTHENTIC... And NOT pricey!  All meals were made from local fresh ingredients.  We'll be back for sure... The Sole alone is worth the pilgrimage!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I ate here three times. And more in the future for sure! Everything is sooo delicious, fresh and of course so French!!"}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner last night. Per the web site, the wine list does combine affordable and expensive wines, but importantly carries French wines.  The waiter seemed knowledgeable and his Gigondas recommendation was a good one. The decor is nice and the atmosphere pleasant, wasn't too loud. The place is small. It's an adult restaurant, so please do not come up with a kids menu. Please!!! Recommend a reservation: thank you for getting into the OpenTable system! I recommend the reservation because the place is new and appears understaffed. Got the sense that each table order is managed as it comes in by the kitchen. So a party of 4 could destabilize the flow. The place was packed at 6h30, so the first wave must have walked in at the 5pm opening. Menu is varied and all items were good and fresh. Waiter knew each item. We shared the charcuterie board and the escargots. The French baguette basket was...French!! My moules poulette were perfectly cooked and the bavette a l'echalotte of 2 guests was cooked perfectly, as was the lamb. Follow the waiter cooking recommendation. We did not stay for dessert. Great value for money and welcoming place. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate our mother's birthday and we had a great time. Service was great and the food was very delicious. Glad we listened to other reviews and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a very charming restaurant.  I read another review that was a great description...... \"Fancy, but casual. You know.... French\" (thanks, Jean Z) We arrived early on a Friday evening, without reservations, but there was only two other tables occupied so we were seated immediately. We started with the Escargot and Egg Mimosa. The Escargot was very nice, great flavor, garlic was definitely present without overwhelming the dish. The Egg Mimosa (deviled eggs) was my least favorite dish of the night. Very bland, no flavor at all...... Our Entrees were the Lamb Brochette and the Carbonara Pasta. My husband had the Lamb, and he said it was nicely cooked and presented, and the potatoes were seasoned well. I had read a Yelp review that did not paint a very flattering picture of the Carbonara Pasta, and I was a bit hesitant to try it....... Mine was fabulous! The pasta was cooked perfectly, the thin slices of onions blended well texturally with the pasta, and just the right amount of bacon. The best is that fabulous egg yolk on top. Absolutely yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a quaint little French restaurant hidden away in Summerlin. You would not think that this place exists being a little neighbor to the Rampart and Lake Mead Starbucks. From the outside it doesn't seem very appealing but once you enter their doors, it has very nice, romantic ambiance to it with the dim lights and french music playing in the background.   The waitress we had was very sweet and helped guide us through the menu. We ordered the escargot which was my first time having it and I was not disappointed at all. It was flavorful and I am glad to have popped my escargot cherry with them! We also had the steak tartar which was also really good! As my main entree, I had the salmon fettuccine which was delicious and filling. The portion that was served was just right if not more than enough. My whole dining experience was amazing to say the least. I highly recommend this place for a date night or GNO/BNO."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled across this restaurant by accident while having a couple coffees at the Starbucks next door.  At first we were not entirely sure but they had their menu posted by the door and we thought why not.  The menu items looked promising and we went inside.  It's a small space but they managed to make it work great with only a few tables and a bar. The ambiance was casual with dark lighting and fun decorations that made it seem like an ideal spot to bring your SO for a romantic dinner date or a relaxing spot to hang out and catch up with old friends.      For our appetizer we ended up ordering the Escargot ($9). Having never tried but always wanted to eat escargot I was super excited. They came out and were delicious. We couldn't get enough of their garlic parsley butter and after we were finished with the escargot we soaked up the butter with their delicious fresh bread that accompanies the table, which they refill quickly.      For dinner I ordered the Prawns Brochette ($15) and my friend ordered the  Moules Poulette ($19). The prawn salad was delicious, although the anise liquor they used to flambe was a tad over powering it was still a delicious meal and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. The mussels were to die for and I kept grabbing a couple here and there from my friends plate! They were so tender they melted in your mouth, so delicious! And the white wine broth was also great so we used more of their bread to soak up the broth. I loved how it was loaded with shallots and garlic.      For dessert, we used the free dessert coupon from Yelp from checking in and we were not disappointed. We ended up getting the chocolate mousse and it was very tasty.      We will definitely be back again and for sure want to make it out earlier to check out their brunch menu. All in all it was a great experience, excellent and friendly staff and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I honestly hate giving bad reviews, but after the four of us kept pushing our dishes to each other we realized that we weren't happy with our meals. We arrived around 7:20 PM and the restaurant had 2 big parties. We were told to wait about 30 minutes, but it took more like an hour. However, we were drinking wine so we were not very concerned about the time.   Once we finally got a table we ordered some appetizers. We got some escargot, beef tartare and sausage/cheese platter. The escargot was well seasoned with garlic and butter, I would recommend this dish. The beef tartare was a large portion and great for sharing. This dish was good, but it's not a dish for everyone. And last we had the cheese and sausage platter which was very standard. I didn't care much about the sausage but the cheese was fresh. So far we were happy with our wine and appetizers.   Once we got our main entrees, thats when the disappointment kicked in. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara which had tons of large slices of onions. The sauce was under seasoned and all I could taste were the onions. Definitely not a fan of huge onions on my dish. My friend ordered the lamb pasta dish. It was pretty much 3 small chucks of lamb and under seasoned pasta. We also had the prawns dish which came with 6 shrimps under a bed of frense salad. This looked more like an appetizer than a main entree. Again we were all so unhappy with the food that no other positive aspect will help us come back."}
{"text":"One of the two best meals on our recently concluded 14 night vacation.  We started off with a goat cheese tartine and a La Betterave (roasted beets with goat cheese, orange segments and vinaigrette).  My wife hit a home run by ordering the sole meuniere (pan seared sole in brown butter sauce with garlic, capers, lemon and parsley) that was accompanied by crisp asparagus spears.  I also fared well by ordering Bavette a L'Echalotte (flank steak with a red wine and shallot sauce) accompanied by crispy french fries. We concluded the meal with a delicious creme brulee though the texture was a little softer than we are accustomed to. Prices are very reasonable given the quality and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very quaint yet felt luxurious.  Food was wxcellent and the service top notch. We will definitely be back.  Too many choices that i wanted to try."}
{"text":"We had such a good time here.  This was my first visit to a French bistro (unless you count marche bacchus a bistro).  It's a great little place with about 8 tables in a slightly hidden location, which makes it even better when you find it.  The décor is dark, the vibe is cozy and it's noisy.  We had 7pm reservations as a party of 4 with 2 of that party running late.  So the wife and I decided to get the wine and appetizers going.  The wine list is very reasonable and accessible, focused on a few French and California wines.  I let our server know that I don't prefer dry French reds and she picked out a bottle.  The Saint Emilion Grand Cru 2012.  Basically a cab-merlot mix.  It was a great choice.  The waitress brought the wine, some bread and water, and 15 minutes later the rest of our party still wasn't there.  I asked our server if she would hold the apps until our party was all there.  I shouldn't have done that, because just as soon as she went in to the kitchen to do as I had asked, our friends finally show up.  Our server noticed right away and got things going again.  I felt bad b/c I thought I may have thrown off her flow, but she recovered and I don't think it was too huge a faux pas.  We ordered some more wine and had:  Smoked salmon tartine - just as you would think.  Salmon, cream cheese, toast  La France board - not the largest size on the menu, but was enough for 4 people to sample everything.  Highlights were the duck slices and the pate.  Everyone enjoyed the mustard served in the little ramekin.  Beef tartare - so good. the capers and shallots and egg and garlic were all present and made for a great bite.  Salad Lyonnaise - skillfully dressed so that the soft egg didn't get the greens too mushy, although frise will stand up to a lot.  This was a very good salad.  Sole Meuniere - cooked correctly, but to me the capers lost their brininess after being fried.  I was looking for some lemon or acid to balance all that butter.  Mussels marinieres - I didn't have any of these, but they all got eaten.  Crème brulee - very creamy with the cackling top.  As expected.  this was a really great dining experience.  The prices are not just reasonable, they're a value.  So we were happy to go deeper into the menu instead of thinking of the bill and shying away.  The food was fresh and enjoyable and I left full, but not stuffed - which is the French way, no?"}
{"text":"Amazing. An oasis in a hot day I had the gazpacho divine! Shrimp in fixer greens but the inspired sweet little being was the cream brûlée. Make a reservation - this place is packed"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great ambiance, and delicious food.  Everything from the many French patrons to the decor and music felt very authentic.  We felt so welcomed by the owner, Richard, who checked in on us often, but  not TOO often haha.  Overall, it was a great experience and I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! What a great find. Nice atmosphere. We had the goat cheese and the salmon. Both were amazing. Needed a couple extra pieces of bread with the goat cheese. Wine was delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, Oh La La stands out as a consistent reminder of our time in Paris. We've been in many times. Very consistent high quality. The owner, Richard, is friendly and welcoming, and his wait staff is consistent in their attentiveness without being overbearing or intrusive. Their wine list is quite good and offers a nice selection of wines by the glass to suit any palate and entree. We've enjoyed their Bavette steak (similar to steak frites) many times, and their onion soup is not to be missed. Their heirloom tomato salad when on the specials list is excellent as well. Just a consistently great restaurant, hidden away in the Starbucks shopping center on the southeast corner of Rampart and Lake Mead. The prices are very reasonable for the caliber of food offered."}
{"text":"just loved this restaurant. As authentic as you cam get in Las Vegas. Not fancy but very reminiscent of your typical bistros if you have been to Paris on a cold European gloomy day. So happy it is in sunny Las Vegas. I will be back for the duck confit alone!"}
{"text":"Cute little gem tucked away in Summerlin. Romantic, chic atmosphere, great for date nights or family outing. So many great selections from the menu that I wish I had 3 stomachs to try all of it.   French onion soup: Love that the bread was on top instead of soaking on the bottom, but only downside is that there wasn't much cheese. The cheese was all absorbed by the bread.  Escargots: I've had better but maybe that's because I'm use to the pesto kind of sauce that goes with it. The escargot from here was cooked with onions.  Mussels in white wine: GET EM!! Mussels were perfectly cooked. Still plump and juicy.   Carbonara: such a cute concept with the raw egg placed in a half egg shell to be poured on to the hot pasta and mixed in. The bacon bits were not that fatty either and had a thickness to them. Definitely worth the $15.   Lamb shank: the seasoning/glaze was too sweet for my liking, but I did like how soft the meat was. It tasted like it was slow cooked for hours. If you don't mind a sweet glaze, try this one."}
{"text":"This is such a cute restaurant with great service and food! The waiter and owner were both very nice. Lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent example of French bistro cuisine !! Second time here and had one of their tat"}
{"text":"Went for dinner Tuesday night with 5 people and it was great, and the prices were more than fair.  We ordered a ton of food and all of it was excellent.  The escargot, french onion soup, charcuterie plank, brie and goat cheese were outstanding, the deviled eggs were only fair.  They made one mistake and forgot to put in my wife's order of salmon, but made up for it by rushing one out and comping the item.  The order of mussels was huge.  The waiters were very nice, but they were heavily tasked, as I guess they were one short due to a health inspector visit that day.  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. We didn't have a reservation, but the owner made sure to find a table for us. He and our server both provided the perfect amount of attention. The food was excellent! I had the endive salad and the Cornish hen, and was impressed and delighted by both."}
{"text":"What a find this small French bistro is!  Spectacular food prepared daily with fresh ingredients. No shortcuts taken in this classic French cuisine."}
{"text":"Just returned from Paris. This restaurant, with it wonderful food, was just like I was still in Paris. Loved the food. The bread was wonderful as well as the rack of lamb. Coming back with 4 other people."}
{"text":"On the recommendation from a friend, I tried Ohlala for lunch with a business associate. Most impressive. Delightful menu, excellent preparation & presentation, friendly staff and delicious taste. European portions keep it real. Nice wine list too. Delighted to know such a pleasant taste of France is available without all the froo-froo."}
{"text":"My Uber driver suggested this restaurant so I figured why not try it. My mom and I met up for lunch. We got mussels, a salad, French onion soup. And a Carmel flan. Service was slow but we didn't mind we were talking and catching up. Everything was tasty and our server was friendly."}
{"text":"Had dinner  for the first time. Food and service were both fantastic. Prices were reasonable. We definitely plan on going back soon!  Chocolate mousse is a must!"}

{"text":"First time in for lunch.  Enjoyed it - the carbonara pasta was fantastic.  Looking forward to visiting for dinner."}
{"text":"Described as a modern French Bistro near Desert Shores in Summerlin Ohlala has done a remarkable job of accruing good word of mouth for nearly two years despite a lack of advertising, its shopping plaza location not really standing out save for Nittaya's Secret Kitchen though that may actually be part of the reason as such a space allows for both modest prices and expectations.  Not exactly a \"destination\" part of Sin City, the proliferation of chains in an HOA-heavy 'burb well-suited to moneyed clientele that likely feels the epitome of dining in Paris is a smoky Café along the Seine, Ohlala French Bistro is operated by Richard Terzaghi who last owned an Osteria in San Francisco, the owner's \"half French-half Italian\" background announced unprompted when explaining why the Restaurant features Mozzarella on its Cheese Plate and Tiramisu on the Dessert Menu.  Filling a prior Restaurant space next to Starbucks, the décor a mish-mash of Pier One ideas, chandeliers and seating ranging from steel bar stools to plush leather banquets, it was shortly after 7/8 of the group was seated that Beverages were poured and Specials described, Richard himself a charming front-of-house sort that genuinely seems to care about customer experience.   Offering a smallish Wine List divided between France and California with fair markups and Food that focuses on France with occasional diversions it was after the final diner arrived that two sharable plates were served alongside outsourced Baguette, the \"Royal Charcuterie\" a great value allowing all to get a taste of eight different Meats for just $27 while \"Le Tout Cheese\" brought only one highlight in the \"stinky French\" Reblochon that apparently warranted three mentions, the rest nothing better than one might find at Walmart and not done any favors by the lone condiment of Pickles.  Most impressed by the smoked Duck amongst the Meats, a plate of Escargot ordered by someone who feigned knowledge of \"real\" French Food but only ate one Snail smothered in Butter and Herbs also showing well, suffice it to say that although edible the French Onion Soup is in desperate need of some Salt or Beef to match-up against the likes of Bardot or Andre's while \"L'Endive\" Salad is far more bitter than it reads thanks too questionable \"candying\" of the Nuts and Mustard in its Dressing.  Sharing Appetizers but ordering Mains separate, the lack of Duck on Summer's menu a disappointment to many, it was after considering $32 Lamb which others seemed to enjoy that the decision was made to instead select Sole Meunière, the Escargot-ordering aficionado declaring it \"too buttery\" while three others including this writer found it nicely prepared and well-balanced by Capers and Citrus, though the limp Asparagus would have benefitted from a little less cooking time.  Allowed to taste another diner's Fettuccine Carbonara before moving onto Dessert, the heavy use of Cream and thus unnecessary Egg Yolk creating something far richer than delicious and utterly confusing as relates to \"authenticity,\" it was with a Double Espresso from Illy washing the palate that a Sundae of outsourced Ice Cream and housemade toppings was served in a Jar, nothing about it remarkable or worth $9 but still a fine Sundae.  THREE STARS:  Positioned in an area lacking for quality Restaurants Ohlala capitalizes by serving French Classics at a fair price, the results generally good and service exemplary though most dishes fall short in one way or another while décor and ambiance leave a lot to be desired compared to Andre's or Marche Bacchus , let alone Bouchon and Bardot."}
{"text":"Perfect French style of service, delicious food, wonderful setting, great music, friendly owner, I loved your restaurant. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here for lunch with my mom and sisters. The food was fantastic and the service and personality of the staff made the experience the very best. I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive - amazing food that is authentic and high quality, generous portions, price is great.  What more could one want?  I got the mussels drenched in wine and garlic - perfection.  Service is fantastic.  Non apetite!  I am coming back and it doesn't have to be a special occasion because it's affordable!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! OMG! What a fantastic meal! Wonderful attentive service!  The appetizer s we're fantastic and very sharable...frog legs, escargot and...the most amazing French Onion Soup I have ever had! Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, my entree of sauteed filet of sole came out and it was Amazing. This is definitely worth the drive out to Summerlin and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lucky find.  We were looking for unusual, different and not on the Strip.  Found it.  Lovely small, intimate place. Hip but comfortable decor. Staff attentive and felt authentic to customers preferences. Food was wonderful. My husband loves steak au poivre but is usually disappointed.  Not last night! He said the meat was superior. I had the pistachio goat cheese appetizer and a wonderful salad.  We will return."}
{"text":"Best French Restaurant in Las Vegas hands down!  This was our first visit here.  The owner was very nice, he was helping out everywhere and you could tell he takes great pride in his fine establishment!  We will be back for sure!    We started with amazing iced tea and the Goat Cheese Tartine, which was incredible!!! We love the iced tea and our server kept them topped off throughout the entire meal.  Thanks Abbie!  I had the Sole MEUNIèRE, which was so delicious.  I have to say it was the most delectable fish I have ever eaten in my life. My husband had the Roasted Cornish Hen, which was very flavorful.  We shared the mashed potatoes, which were so tasty and disappeared quickly!  We topped off our magnificent meal with our complimentary dessert, Creme Caramel, via the Yelp app.    What a way to celebrate our Valentines Day a little early!   Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint and lovely, this is wonderful and situated in the heart of Summerlin. The preparation and flavors represent everything you would want in a French Bistro, and my family will be heading back there again soon."}
{"text":"went here for brunch on sunday. everything was just okay; creme brule not so good"}
{"text":"The flank steak was over cooked for me, but I completely understand because it such a thin cut. It tasted really nice with the sauce and frites, but even the fries weren't all too great. I tried the lamb also and it was seasoned really nicely. It was very subtle, but enjoyable. I will come back someday, but maybe not for the flank. I'm excited to try something else from here.   Also, it really great service as the owner or cook (not sure) came to check in on us and was very warm toward us."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and there was literally only one server and I'm assuming the manager as well.  We wanted to try this spot because we saw it had great reviews. The food was... average. We waited over an hour for this pistachio goat cheese and it was not good. Every time we told the server we didn't want it anymore, he kept saying, \"I swear it's coming out.\" They seemed to be sweating as it was fairly busy for a small venue. Definitely need one other server. Our server was nice! He was just too busy to really take care of us like we would have been taken care of if we went to a restaurant on the strip.  I understand it's a small place but this guy was manning the whole place! Our food came out in a strange order as well.  We tried to order a wine and they said they didn't have it so we had to order a more \"expensive\" one. The French onion soup was good! So if you just want soup, go in for that!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to Summerlin.  Really good French food at reasonable prices.  High quality ingredients and imaginative dishes.  Menu not so big but plenty of culinary delights to choose from.  Appetizers, entrees and specials are tailored to the season and delicious.  I like the flank steak frites and sandwich selection.  They know how to use cheese in their dishes.  Near Nittaya's Kitchen which set the standard in the area for Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, very unique cuisine. Make reservation if possible. Wine selection is very good and appetizers are delicious."}
{"text":"Great French restaurant...and it's close to where I live!  The food is great and the owners are very friendly which is an added bonus.  We had the escargot, which is very good, but I do like a lot of garlic in mine.  I had the sole and my daughter had the Cornish hen which were both excellent.  Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had a very nice lunch and the food was awesome.  Good selection of French bistro items and reasonable prices. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is my favourite french restaurant outside of Montreal and France.  It makes me really happy that it's very close to my house.  Ohlala serves delicious classic french dishes at very reasonable prices.  I've tried their moules, their foie gras, their pomme frites, and beef tartare.  I had their warm goat cheese pistachio, and their hachis parmentier.  Actually, I think I've tried just about most items on their menu (including the caramel flan, tiramisu, and chocolate mousse) and every single item has been absolutely delicious.  I definitely can't wait to take my sister's in-laws (who are french) to this restaurant when they come visit me next."}
{"text":"Amazing! I hesitate to write this review because I don't want people taking up seats and reservations before we can get to them. Cannot say enough wonderful things about this place.  We are So happy that we have found another place with a \"local feel\"... No video poker, no smoking indoors, not a chain. The service was beyond amazing, very upbeat staff and owner. The wine and food are unique and well priced. Lastly, the atmosphere was so pleasant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped by this afternoon and had a wonderful experience. The staff was attentive and the food delicious. The pistachio goat cheese appetizer is highly recommended."}
