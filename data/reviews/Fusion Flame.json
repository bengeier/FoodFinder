{"text":"Ok food, awful service. It's not that the server is bad. It seems he/she's indifferent. We waited an hour and 10 minutes for our food. 20 min until we got water, after we asked, and another 20 - 25 min then until we got soup. It wasn't busy.  I decided this is take out only place. And today I called at 1:50 pm for a take out and was told it'd take 30 minutes. I showed up 25 minutes later, the order isn't even in. Not busy at all, only one table being served. The girl gave me a blank look as I asked for my food. It took a few seconds for her to realize. I give 6 months until they close if they keep this up."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Super clean and attentive server. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge! I had the chicken fried rice and my friend had the spicy shrimp noodles. As an appetizer, we went for the chicken pakuras (I think that's how you spell it). We has a wonderful time and are definitely thinking of visiting? it again! 

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice Chinese/Indian restaurant"}
{"text":"Food is good however the service sucks, we had to ask for cutlery, water as the guy didn't care to check any tables. Seemed like he was filling in for someone. The wait for food was over an hour which sucked as we were here from work hours. Won't recommend the place unless you have nothing else to do."}
{"text":"This is the best Hakka food I have eaten in the GTA. Service is great too and it's clean and well kept. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"I come for lunch sometimes and it's okay. Quick and filling portions for a good price."}
{"text":"Was in the area and kids did not want the choice nearby that we picked up for ourselves. Saw a sign at the nearby grocery store that upon buying an entr√® a fried rice or a noodle dish was 1/2 price. Sounded like a good deal and kids did. It mind eating Indian Style Chinese so we headed to Fusion which was just the other side of the plaza of where we were. 

Ordered a Vegetarian Manchurian and a Veg Hakka Chow Mein for takeaway. The place is super small it seemed but a decent sitting area. 

The Veg Manchurian was not as spicy as other restaurants but good anyways. The balls were bit mushy, but perhaps by the time we reached our destination and had the food, it was approx 30 minutes plus. The noodles, again a little less spicy by the Indian Style Chinese but edible. The saving grace was that it was less oily/greasy compared to others. 

Would go back and wouldn't mind sitting in."}
{"text":"Thought we would grab some takeout on a sat night for 4 people. We ordered Hakka chow mien, spring rolls, General Tao and chicken wings. We had an allergy to onions and requested no onions in the chow morning general two but did not realize that the chicken wing would be smothered in onions!  There should be a caution of how hot some of these dishes are prepared. I love spicy but everything was overboard. The chow mien tasted like it was cooked in hot sauce. It was too much heat to taste anything else but the Tabasco sauce. The general Tao was unrecognizable. They flavoured the chicken pieces well but then covered it in what I think is black bean sauce and soya sauce. It was goopy and salty AF. People with cholesterol problems; you were warned! The chicken wings were spicy and delicious but one person could not eat it. So I give this place 1* because the chicken wings and spring rolls were good but otherwise way too many hot sauces and salt being used at this place. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Terrible service with no concept of time. After an hour and a half of wait, the rude server asked if we want to continue to wait or just give my money back. This is what happens when you try new places."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with service to be honest food was good but nothing to rave over. We asked for water when we placed the order we did not get our glass till we got our main course. We ordered for baby corn dish in the starter the server advised us they may be out so I said if that's the case let's go with the patato dish in the starters, she never came back to say if the baby corn dish was available or not and she never got the patato starter either. The manchurian was full of lil green chillies, my son could not have it because of the level of heat. I personally prefer a good lighting in restaurants, this place was way too dull."}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch and found this place randomly in the area with the expectation to have some hakka style cuisine.  

Ordered 2 regular sized soups and the special fried rice to dine in.  The portions are decently sized which is great for leftovers.

I had the cream of corn soup with chicken; probably one of the best I have tried so far as it was a sweet type of corn and had lots of chicken and egg. 

The hot and sour soup my boyfriend ordered had much left to be desired.. It wasn't spicy!  It appeared more like a beef broth more than anything and was a little thinner than most when it came to consistency.  

The special friend rice was yummy but not really special or anything to fuss over. It was very typical like any rice from Chinese.. a little disappointing since I was really looking forward to it.  There was quite a bit of shrimp but not much else and saw some veggies like peas that aren't usually in there.  

Service was friendly and fast.  Place was clean but I don't think I would be dying to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome foods as this is family run restaurant 
Most of the dishes are Hakka Chinese styles with fusion mixed into wholesome goodness. The business just started 2 months ago and a lot of my others friends like the place.  So I need to check it out and glad I made a right choice our lunch event."}
