{"text":"Pork souvlaki was excellent....served on a pita with optional sides.. very generous amount of high quality tzatziki....the gyros are good, the meat is \"homemade\" and has more flavour than your typical gyro meat.   Pls note, the place has a few tables but it is small and its best to do takeout.  Will try the burger next."}
{"text":"The cashier was really nice and friendly. Opened up my takeout container and was amazed on the presentation of my chicken souvlaki dinner. Tasted pretty good and didn't have anything bad to say about it. My mom just got too much onions but that's about it. I recommend you to go here!"}
{"text":"I found out about George's Greek Grill through a facebook contest where I had won a dinner for 4 and got 4 pitas and 2 sides. The restaurant seating area itself is tiny and would be better to take out food if you're planning to buy food for more than 2 people.  We got 2 orders of the Greek Grill Chicken, 1 order of the Chicken Delight, and 1 order of the Gyro. I thought I wouldn't be full after eating just a pita, but all three of these pita's were huge and stuffed with the meat and toppings. They are very generous on portion sizes! We also got a side of fries and onion rings (highly recommend - they are crispy and salty!).  The flavours were great and I am definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Grabbed the dinner special for two. The chicken on a pita was delicious.  It had a large amount of chicken, which was nice to see.  The Cesar salad was standard fair, and the rust potatoes were excellent. A touch on the saltier side.  The decor is clean and Greek!  Hello support this local spot.  Come by and be hungry!   I have not tried the whole menu,  but a great start.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try George's Greek Grill based on seeing a new Greek restaurant filling the gap Since Mr Greek left the city.  My wife had the pork souvlaki dinner and I the gyro dinner both with side pita and Greek salad.  Big portions and reasonable priced for two with soft drink for $27 taxes in.  The owner gave us bonus for free a new item French fries with garlic sauce and feta cheese, definitely George add that on the menu.  Looks like we have a regular Greek restaurant in downtown Mississauga for repeat visits."}
{"text":"Yummy Greek food for the area! Staff was super nice also, would return without a doubt."}
{"text":"Come hungry! Wow this little gem of a spot not only has amazing portion sizes but their 3D sauce is delish!! Great interactions, food was yum and like I said... you need to come hungry. I ordered the Chicken Delight Pita with side Greek Salad and hubby had Gyro on a Greek Salad. We both love Greek food and were both impressed on quality, taste and portion size. We have found our new Greek spot!! Best for takeout as there are only a couple of tables."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Greek food I've had!!  Honestly this place is a hidden gem!  They are not cheap with their food! Portions are huge & worth your money.  Delicious sauces and always fresh food.   Looove this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the large portion sizes. We ordered the Chicken Pita dinners with a side of rice and onion rings (they were out of potatoes)  The wrap itself was standard, the chicken was tasty.  Giving 3 stars because the food was on the saltier side and...the owner didn't crack a smile!!   We will be back to try some other menu items.  Great to support local restaurants in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"The customer service was really lacking in this location. The chicken they used was very cold and seemed a bit raw. For a chicken breast it had a very weird rubbery texture. They used various different pieces as if it was left over from another meal. Will not recommend  it at all."}
{"text":"Don't understand what all the rave is about.   Came here because it's conveniently located next to my nail place. When I saw there was a Greek food place nearby, I was really excited. I immediately ran to yelp to check out what others thought. I saw things like \"delicious\" \"large portions\" and 5 stars so of course I was looking forward to it.  It was cute- plain, but Greek-ish style. Light blue with a couple of tables and a couple of small paintings   I ordered two chicken dinners. They have a dinner for two meal which includes two dinners with two sides and two pops for 26$ plus tax.   What I didn't understand was they had dinners or pitas. The dinner  want a plate but it was still a pita.. we were more used to a traditional souvlaki dinner. The girl at the front seemed very confused herself and really had trouble explaining what the situation was.   Anyways. Here's the meal breakdown:   The chicken came sliced, more of a filet sliced into cubes rather than souvlaki style. It came in a box with lettuce, tomatoes, tzaziki and onion. Luckily I live close or the lettuce would have been soggy. Didn't understand why they put both meals in one box. TzaZiki was minimal, we actually scrapes the containers to get just barely enough to dip our chicken. Didn't taste much like traditional tzaziki, couldn't compare it to anything else to be honest. The portion size wasn't \"large\" or \"generous\" but fair at best. The faux salad had nothing on it, just blan iceberg shredded with some lettuce and onion.  We got the rice and the potatoes as sides. Rice was ok- a little on the salty side, an undertone of chicken broth flavour. The potatoes are where all the salt went.  They were so salty we could barely get them down. The containers for the sides were pretty large however. Also came with a grilled cut pita each.   We've been to many authentic Greek places, and this wasn't really comparable to anything we've tried. Pretty blan, no distinct seasoning, no holding back on the salt on the sides though.   Overall nothing to really rave about.   Food 2/5 Service 2/5 Atmosphere 3/5 Prob won't be back and wouldn't really recommend to any friends to try. I really wanted to like this place, all hype but it just didn't deliver."}
