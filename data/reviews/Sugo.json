{"text":"Simple Italian comfort food at reasonable prices. Between all of us we were able to try most of the items on the menu and all agreed everything was pretty tasty. The staff was friendly the atmosphere upbeat. Enjoyable night overall."}
{"text":"Great food. Even better tiramisu. Love the vibes and staff.  The real deal sandwhich spot."}
{"text":"Brand new to Lansdowne and Bloor, Sugo has a nice, clean aesthetic and a ton of boxing posters framed on the walls.  Espresso drinks are pleasantly strong, and the rose sauce and mozzarella taste like they're made fresh in house every day (they are).  The owner Alex is very friendly, service took an average of 15 min on my first two visits, and the food that came out (Eggplant and Veal sandwichs) were  excellent.  Nona's is just west and the prices are a bit lower, but to me Sugo's wins for overall freshness and decor."}
{"text":"When i first heard of this place in my area, i thought it was great to have an Italian sandwich place near by. I tried the chicken parm sandwich and i wasn't really impressed. It was okay but it wasn't worth $12:40. I think their prices are way to high. I've had much better for about $4 dollars less."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend. We ordered spaghetti and gnocchi. Simple but delicious. Worth going back! (The cappuccino was awesome)"}
{"text":"I know comparing any veal sandwich to California sandwiches(original location at Dundas/Bathurst) is almost blasphemy...but Sugo has a damn good veal sandwich."}
{"text":"Not much else to be said - I agree with all the other reviews. Nonna's down the street may be delicious/better value for sandwiches but they keep very limited hours ... so Sugo is now reigning champ as the neighborhood spot for casual Italian. (the tiramisu is ah-mehzing)  Service is also very kind, and a little animated/lively lol. Brought a friend who was very soft-spoken and there was a misunderstanding with his order. No problem, fixed it in a snap."}
{"text":"This place will be a staple local business for years to come. One of the best meatballs I have ever tried. Cold cut sandwich made to perfection. Service was top notch, and everyone was raving about there dishes. I could eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Every time I think of Sugo I just have to smile. The second you pass through the front door you are in for an experience; starting with a sincere and friendly greeting. I arrived before the Thursday dinner rush and was able to nab a table by the window. The second experience is seeing the passerby-ers' of Bloorcourt which will provide with you enough entertainment and conversation to last you through your dinner. They keep the menu easy and fresh. I went for the Ricotta Gnocchi, which was actually light and very filling. Full basil leaves graced the top adding to the freshness. Sitting so close to my neighbour in this acquainted restaurant gave me a glimpse at the huge portions of the Eggplant Sandwich, which I'll be back for. I left feeling like family."}
{"text":"A nice little place for lunch around the Bloor and Lansdowne area.  The food here is prepared quick, but it has that great Italian home made flavour with friendly staff to boot.  The menu has great prices and the servings are a good size.  I ordered the gnocchi lunch pasta and although the portion could have been bigger, I thought it tasted delicious.  A friend of mine however ordered the spaghetti and it seemed like his plate was endless.  A great spot for lunch if you're in the area, I will definitely be making another trip here when I'm in the area.  The owner also is a super friendly dude, always asking if we needed anything and how our food was.  That really goes a long way when you're trying out new places!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! A little piece of Brooklyn right here in Toronto. Everything from the vibe, decor, attitude and of course... the food! Truly authentic NYC Style Italian Sandwich shop. I love all the old boxing paraphernalia.   Homemade pasta, meatballs, classic Italian sandwiches. I've tried the Veal Sandwich and salads. Came back for a meatball. The pastas and sauce are all homemade, and they hand pull their mozzarella here. The ricotta and basil mixed with the tomato sauce is amazing. The sandwich made me feel like I was back in Brooklyn.   The owners were were friendly, though they should pump up the Brooklyn attitude, and the service was excellent.   Will definitely become a regular spot"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Best italian in town for the price. That chicken sandwich with a nice big side of spaghetti. Oh man...just so good. Wait staff super knowledgeable and friendly. And the food...amazing!"}
{"text":"Came three times, each time with different friends - was just too excited to show off the new neighbourhood gem.  Great service, and impeccable, non fussy Italian food.   Sometimes i wonder when they will change that foozeball table for another table so there's less waiting."}
{"text":"Great group of people working there. Really nice, casual environment. Stellar sandwiches! I had the veal and my gf had the eggplant. Really really good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!  My boyfriend is Italian and it is extremely picky when we get Italian food out, but he was more than happy when he had his veal sandwich. He said it was fresh and tasted amazing.   I happened to try the gnocchi which was delightful. The right texture and the sauce was so on point! We also ordered olives and bread to share which were also tasty.   We did not try the desserts but the table next to us ordered the tiramisu and it looked delightful, they seemed to enjoy it very much. I was definitely jealous!   We will be coming back here for sure. It was a lovely place! Amazing food and great service!"}
{"text":"We love this place, so very, very much. The staff has a very charming and gruff nature, the kind of Italians you might expect to find in a Boxing gym in New York. They're memorable, funny and kind.   The menu is small and simple, featuring American Italian comfort food. You have your selection of pastas and a selection of sauces.  There are all the classic sammies, and we're particularly in love with the appetizers. They regularly feature special dishes which they announce on instagram and we always make a point of going in when we can.   The tiramisu is just perfect, you can really taste the coffee liquor. They have delicious cocktails, including a wonderful Limoncello.    Prices are very fair for the quality of food.   Calamari: It is always tender, with a light and crunchy batter, never particularly greasy. It is served with aioli and tomato sauce and a generous amount of fresh parsley.   Stuffed Peppers: Love these!  Mildly spicy peppers with ground meat, loads of parmesan and a wonderful balanced tomato sauce - we highly recommend getting some bread with this so you can eat every drop of it."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood! A very NY/NJ kind of vibe. The calamari was incredible, our veal sandwiches were amazing too and huge - we had to eat them with forks and knives! Very friendly staff, who greeted us the moment we entered, checked with us midway through our appetizers and again during our main course! Seeing that it's only a 5 min walk from home, I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a eggplant sandwich to try out in my neighbourhood.  $11 for a rubbery eggplant corners! Absolutely no flavour in sauce. No toppings included   And 10mins of wait to get this made ! .  PLEASE head over to Nonna's one block west near sterling rd and Bloor. And you can thank me later.  Half the price , more toppings , friendlier and faster service."}
{"text":"SUGO! SUGO! SUGO!  One of my favorite Italian spots that's affordable and non fancy(in a good way). The restaurant has a very relaxed vibe and the staff are always so friendly. I've only been there twice but I have been blown away both times. I had their Gnocchi and mozzarella sticks which was amazing. You can really taste the freshness of the pasta and the sauce is just exquisite. Must try!"}
{"text":"So, this is a 4 & 1/2 star for me. I really enjoyed the food and vibe of Sugo. It's as if it's straight out of a movie. Wood paneling, vintage boxing posters, checkered table cloths. Sugo doesn't have a huge menu, nor do they need to, they do what they do and they do it well.  We ordered the stuffed peppers, the meatball, gnocchi and rigatoni. The pasta was perfect, and the meatball was incredibly tender (I preferred it to my Italian mother in laws meatballs). The biggest compliment my husband could give was that the sauce was almost as good as his mom's, which, for an Italian is a huge compliment to give!  If you have room, get some tiramisu, it was so incredibly creamy and had great coffee flavour!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall joint gives me the New York style vibes. Owners and servers there are all very friendly and down to earth, and that's part of the experience eating in a restaurant. You can tell the owners are passionate about what they do. Now about the food - all the dishes I tried did not disappoint. The calamari is very tender, although I would add a little citrus to the sauce to give it some zing. The second dish was the meatball. First of all, it was HUGE (that's what she said). The meatball was not dry, and the marinara tasted great. The gnocchi was freshly made. It was good, bonus that it's freshly made. To be honest though, I would prefer the spaghetti personally because there is more texture in the spaghetti. The pasta is cooked al dente, and with the sauce and the meat it all married together nicely. Can't go wrong with the spaghetti. Last but not least is dessert. We ordered the tiramisu, and the owners were generous to offer us a scoop of the hazelnut gelato on the house. Oh my word the gelato is amazing! It has a very smooth consistency, the the hazelnut flavour is very strong with no artificial taste. It's a must try. As for the tiramisu, it has a strong coffee taste to it, but not so much that the lady fingers are drenched in coffee.  This restaurant serves simple, wholesome, Italian dishes. That's how it's done in Italy. They don't mess around with ten choices of pastas, and a long list of sauces to go with it. Keep it simple, keep it real  I'll be back."}
{"text":"the absolute best! a go to spot for all my friends, they legitimately come once a week for the mortadella deli sandwich and their rigatoni in rose! you will not be disappointed. they get take out all the time but also dine in when hey can - when we did dine in, we got the calamari to start and they came out very fresh and lightly battered, served with a side of their marinara! can't wait for my next Sugo fix!"}
{"text":"By being more of an anachronism than a restaurant, Sugo brings back the tastes, portions and service of years long past.   This small little shop on Bloor delivers big by offering generous portions (the veal sandwich came with TWO patties and the spaghetti was good for two meals). The friendly staff gave us our food on time as promised, joked around without an inkling of pretension - a quality that is hard to find in Toronto these days. Prices were more than fair considering the quanity and quality of what you get.  Sugo is must go in Toronto."}
{"text":"The meatball sandwich was AMAZING. a nice clean interior, easy to understand menu. Pricey at thirteen bucks, I'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Great!!! Simple but great place. Hope this place sticks around forever. The tomato sauce tastes REAL, not too chunky, not too pureed, just perfect consistency, they did NOT \"overpower\" the sauce with too much garlic etc,  which a lot of places sometimes do, this tomato sauce was great. After eating this meatball sandwich, I'd rather die than eat a meatball sandwich at Subways ever, ever again. Love this place. I do wish they would have a standing promotion of like \"5-dollar meatball sandwich Tuesdays\" or something. Will come here again."}
{"text":"This place is pure gold. Those raviolis - OMG. Soooo good!!! Everything we tried was delicious. And fast. Served up with a wink and a smile. Cheap!! FUN. And you can bring the kids and still have a solid cocktail! In love. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Well, I came here due to all the rave reviews and was not disappointed.  While I did not expect the vibe to be completely casual- tile floors, diner tables, foosball table, etc., the food was delicious, and the complete absence of any pretence was a welcome change.  The chicken sandwich (be sure to add peppers and onions) was scrumptious. The calamari (a 12$ appetizer) was perfectly fried and served with a mayo and a cocktail-type sauce. The house-made gnocchi was perfect.  Sugo is more the place for a quicker meal or a place to take the family.  If you are headed to a nearby bar , this is the perfect spot for a meal beforehand."}
{"text":"They don't make their own spaghetti pasta more but the gnocchi is made fresh and is very good   Still same great service and attitudes"}
{"text":"Great food, cute place, good prices, nice people.  This place is dangerously close to my house, like I can walk there in 2 minutes. The meatballs were just like nonna makes them, sandwiches & gnocchi were good too. Will have to go back and check out more of the menu. Very limited seating though, so takeout is probably a better option for the most part."}
{"text":"Perfect casual Italian...with the prices to match!    (Again, dunno why Italian food is soo pricey here/has to be in a fancy joint.)  Anyway, menu is simple.  The \"Platter\" option required a bit of explanation to me.  I'm still not sure if certain sauces only come with certain pastas.  According to the friendly waiter, everything - excluding the Moz Sticks and Rigatoni pasta itself - is made in-house.    After some debating, I shared a Rigatoni, Caprese, & yes, a Tiramisu with 1 other person.  Amount was just right and we did not have leftovers.  Everything was really good, but the Rigatoni stood out.  Cooked perfectly al dente and the rosé sauce was so creamy and rich, but not overly heavy!  Nice red beefsteak tomatoes used for the Caprese.  Tiramisu, made in-house, was heavenly and we had to try it even though the pasta/salad filled us up nicely.  :)  Staff were very welcoming, friendly.  I was even offered a sample of Lambrusco when I found out that they had it.  And it wasn't that crap from the LCBO.   Lotsa patrons seemed to be regulars who are from the neighbourhood.  I'd definitely go back when I'm in the Bloor/Lansdowne area next!  P.S.  Why aren't there more places like this?  It's such an easy concept!"}
{"text":"I had the Veal sandwich.  Very satisfying. Not overly big, but very good. Hits the Spot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night and it was pretty good! The staff was patient and gave us lots of time to order from the menu when we were waiting for everyone to arrive. We started with calamari and garlic bread while we waited. Then for the mains I got their special which was a spinach gnocchi with sauce. As for dessert, we split a tiramisu amongst ourselves. Everything was fairly priced for the portion size, and delicious! Would come back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to me and it didn't disappoint. If you're hungry the streak sandwich will definitely fill you up and the Caprese salad was amazing. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This spot is legit. Beautiful meatballs with a phenomenal sauce. The aesthetic is a modern classic that is humble, clean and inviting. Prices are fair as fair can be for the portions which are generous. It's a welcome addition to a much needed expansion of the available options in this hood."}
{"text":"Great flavour for reasonable prices. I spent well over $120.00 for take out. But I pretty much got one of everything. The calamari was soggy but that was my bad because ordering calamari for take out can be rather tricky. The veal and chicken sandwiches were slightly over cooked. (But hey, that happens sometimes). The mozzarella sticks were awesome. Those disappeared faster than 2.3 seconds. The meatball, spaghetti and gnocchi were spot on. And the Cesar was great.  The tiramisu was so good my 2 year old managed to eat a whole piece himself in less than 60 seconds. Thank God I ordered 2. Definitely will be back again. Welcome to the area. It's about time we got someone like you in the hood."}
{"text":"I've come out of Yelp retirement for this review because this place is just that good.  Love the \"forgedddaboutit\" vibe, and overall simplicity.  This is the type of spot you go to with friends for a non-pretentious environment and great conversation.  Service is attentive and sincere when they ask \"How's the food guys?\"  Went last night and ordered a Meatball sammy with cheese and peppers.  Felt it could use a little spice but fortunately chilis are already placed on every table for this purpose.  For $11 this thing was stacked.  I had to eat it with a knife and fork and loved every second of it. My partner stuck with traditional fare and got the spaghetti, which was also a hit.  The noodles perfectly cooked, and sauce that obviously came from experience in these matters.  Sugo is worth going out of your way for as it's definitely an experience. The good food is just a bonus!  Will come back as I'm dying to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I lovvvvvve the energy up in this joint!   Everyone is super friendly, high energy and positive.  From the servers to the owners to the cook, you can feel the genuine passion and enthusiasm from each and every one of them. They make an effort to get acquainted with you, take the time to explain their menu with so much passion and you can definitely tell they take pride in serving simple yet delicious traditional Italian dishes.  I felt like I walked into a typical Italian family dinner...lots of good food, good wine, good conversations with lots of hand gestures and yelling! I love it!!!   The menu is simple at a very good price for the amount of food you get. Sugo makes their own sauce, pasta and cheese so you know you are getting fresh ingredients everyday.  If you like their sauce, you can also buy a jar to take home.     I would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to this hood, and I was excited to try Sugo.  Food was tasty; prices reasonable - though pricier than on their online menu for some items (e.g. some appetizers were $1 higher at the restaurant). Biggest downer was the service. Service was on the suffocating side - felt like they wanted us out quickly & the second we finished one plate we had a staff member pop in to remove it. Really hard to relax and enjoy your meal with them hovering. With the service in mind, the restaurant itself is pretty small with only about 30 seats, and it got really busy on Friday night.   Rating: 3.5 stars - rounded it to 4.   P.S. if curious, the platter is $3 cheaper and does not include bread. For example: gnocchi pasta + veal sandwich minus the bread will cost $23 instead of $26. Personally don't consider this much of a deal as the portion seemed quite a bit smaller than purchasing it separately."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stumbled across this new Italian spot that just opened up this week offering a small menu of pasta, sandwiches, salads, and a few desserts. The restaurant is filled with three tables, some bar stools, and a foosball table. The walls are decorated with framed boxing magazine cover prints and a pair of boxing gloves from the 60s are hung above the kitchen entrance.  Apparently the owners and some kitchen staff are boxers. We ordered Gnnochi, Calamari, and Veal Sandwich.  Pastas and sauce are homemade, and they hand pull their mozzarella here. The pasta's portion is not huge but just enough. The pasta is cooked perfectly, the ricotta and basil mixed with the tomato sauce is heavenly.  The sandwich is big and filling. The calamari is served with lemon, deep fried onion strings, mayo and marinara sauces. The meal was delicious and leaving us wanting more. The owner and staff were friendly and the service was excellent. Can't wait to come back and try out other items on the menu in the near future."}
{"text":"This restaurant is everything I had hoped for and more! The food is so much bang for your buck, the decor is understated and casual (think foosball table in the centre of the restau and red checkered tablecloths), and the service is 10/10.   If you're looking for authentic, delicious, affordable food and a casual vibe, this is your place!   I went with a group of 4 and ordered:   Apps:  Stuffed Peppers: 10/10  - these were so good that we tried to order more but they ran out! Meatballs x 3: 10/10 - we kept going back for more!  Calamari: 8.5/10 - delicious but if you're limiting your order, this would be my suggested cut. Mozzarella sticks: 8/10 - same as above.   Pastas:  We ordered all 3 and re-ordered the rigatoni, it was that good! Spaghetti and gnocchi: 10/10; rigatoni: 11/10.   Salads:  Caesar and caprese: 8/10 - delicious, simple, and if you want to include some greens, these were great. If not, I'd recommend sticking to their sauce-based dishes.  Sandwiches:  Eggplant sandwich: 8/10 - I was expecting this to be the show stopper, but i'd happily trade it for another bowl of rigatoni, a meatball or a stuffed pepper.   Finally, i'd highly recommend the tiramisu - 10/10.  All of this + 2 bottles of wine = $215. In my view, that's a steal!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a very casual, affordable Italian place with exceptional food, look no further :)   I absolutely adored Sugo. Attentive service, laidback atmosphere and very large portions for the price! I like how their menu isn't overwhelming, but provides a good selection of Italian classics.   I highly recommend the mozzarella sticks and the eggplant sandwich, which at $10 is super filling and so flavourful!  I'd love to come back here to try some of pasta dishes - both my friends got the pasta and said it was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was great!  Stuffed peppers- that filling is yum Meatball- is a must order  Eggplant- was breaded, cooked and seasoned perfectly, also a must order Rigatoni- a must order - rose sauce is fire Gnocchi- not as heavy and dense like most places, cooked well and the sauce with the cheese, so good. Caprese Salad- fresh ingredients with the right amount of seasoning and olive oil and basil. Yum  Prices are very reasonable and not overpriced like most Italian places.  You can tell they use simple and fresh ingredients, how Italian food should be made! They're hella busy, be prepared to wait but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Very charming, perfect for serious discussions. There is no longer a fossball table (hypothesis: because the food is so damn good). Garlic bread sized for a Mortgagor, crisp and sharp caesar & well-delivered pasta. Imported ingredients adorn the classic airey décor. Metaphorical bullets adorn my impression. Third best olives in Toronto (followed by #1 Bar Begonia and #2 The Lounge at The Hyatt)."}
{"text":"We ordered the spaghetti and a meatball, and the gnocchi. Everything was really good but a little pricey. Real disappointed about the serving size the gnocchi.  We will go back to try more items.  They have a foosball that is free to play while you wait or to work off some of that excellent food."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious serving athletic Italian sandwiches and rich homemade pasta sauces, olives, and more. This place is my new favourite! The fresh herbs and attention to detail really shows the love this place puts into their food. I highly recommend you check out this great spot!"}
{"text":"I visited Sugo for an early Saturday dinner. Off the bat, the restaurant is SMALL. If you have a large group and Sugo remains as busy as they are, you must go on off hours.  The staff is wonderful! So inviting, friendly, warm and genuinely happy you are there. The space reminded me of my nonna's basement. They ended up capturing the spirit of an Italian-home.  We had the mozzarella sticks, pasta al forno and breaded chicken sandwich to share. Honestly, the food was great! It's authentic and the price is right. If I had to recommend one thing, I think the breaded chicken sandwich needs better, more crusty bread. I found our bread got soggy under the sauce.  If I'm in the area again, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food (the veal sandwich was amazing), amazing coffee and fantastic friendly service!   I highly recommend checking this place out when in Bloordale."}
{"text":"This place was a great find by our friend.  It has a relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff but is a bit noisy.    The menu selections are straightforward Italian fare. The quality of the food is excellent while the portion sizes and prices are reasonable.   For our party of three, we thoroughly enjoyed every morsel of the caesar salad, meatballs, and stuffed-pepper starters, gnocchi and rigatoni entrees and tiramisu for the finish.  We will definitely come back."}
