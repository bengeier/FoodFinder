{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant and weren't sure what to expect but after trying it, we were pleasantly surprised by how tasty the food was. We ordered bbq skewered lamb, pork belly, chicken wings, and quail. All the meat was perfectly bbq and we'll seasoned. The meat was tender and juicy. We tried the small hot and sour soup which was a very big bowl that could easily feed 6 people.   Overall fast service. Very flavourful bbq skewers. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bbq dishes and jellyfish salad. I always come here late at night on a weekday and they are always busy! Reasonable price for what you're getting and they have beer on tap. I don't know about their main dishes but normally I come here for the little bbq appetizers. Service is fast as well and they do have an interac machine. I took off one star because of how clean it is."}
{"text":"Yang's Lamb Skewers, Chicken Gizzards, Cabbage Skewer, are to die for. (Almost everything is here) . I wouldn't say the price is extremely cheap, but it is reasonable. This place is definitely worth going to if you like spicy food. However it is not the cleanest place to eat. But hey, as long as the food tastes good, its good in my eyes."}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing bbq. Must try their skewers especially shrimp, lamb, sausage , squid and chilli. What's even more amazing? It's open late night!!"}
{"text":"I live for the nights of food festivals and bbq'd meats and veggies on a skewer. Yang's recreates that bbq-goodness wonderfully in its cozy restaurant.  I love how every skewer is bursting with flavour - granted, it's spicy and the flavour is the same flavour regardless of which skewer you get, whether it be beef, lamb, or mushroom, but it's a great place to go to for snacks with friends, or for a dinner when you just want some good old Asian comfort street food! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly dirty. The tables aren't cleaned properly, the floors are greasy, the washrooms are atrocious.  However, the food is decent but extremely questionable with their lack of hygiene. Most of all, the owner of this restaurant asked me to pay tip when I went up to the counter to pay my bill.  Obviously the owner collected all the tip and I refused to give him the tip but instead I went back to the table and gave it to the server. I would never come back to this horrible restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"We used to go to this place a lot for BBQ food and they were great, I think one of the best in Toronto for Chinese BBQ items.  Loved their BBQ cabbage, very unique.  This place sells cheap local brewed beer as well.  HOWEVER, I stopped going to this place now they really need to improve their cleanliness, I was there one time and the washroom was disgusting with flies!!   City of Toronto also posted a yellow notice with conditional pass sticker at the door.  The cloth that they used to clean tables are disgusting, leaves a really disgusting smell.    I mean their food is excellent and authentic but it's a dirty restaurant, a few of my friends have also stopped going there."}
{"text":"Very very bad attitude. Waiting for half hour 2 waitresses only serve other table not ours.  Tried to ask waitress. Who is very rude and reply you can cancel Anytime don't rush me.  ! Disappointed"}
{"text":"Yangs bbq is similar to most northern style Chinese food restaurants. It is tucked in the corner of finch and midland. They are open until 2AM so that's always a plus !   We ordered the dumplings, skewers, pancake, dry chicken in a wok, and a chicken noodle dish. Their portions are quiet generous. It should be noted that, their food is very oily and spicy. Would only recommend if you are feeling hungry & cold."}
{"text":"Yang's BBQ Restaurant is a spot where you and a couple of friends could hang and have a great conversation over beer and skewers. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is typically quite lively as it usually has a nice flow of guests coming in and out of the place.   The style of food being served is very much street-stand style, which is a niche that's quite underserved well in the area. The prices will not break your wallet, but they will definitely rack up with a few items here and there so definitely be mindful of that. If you're looking to fill up on a budget, then I would supplement with a carb dish such as noodles or dumplings on top of the skewer menu.   Although the dining room of the restaurant is satisfactory, the washroom facilities looks like it came out of 'The Upsidedown ' from Stranger Things. The lighting goes from brightly lit to dark hues of blue as soon as you walk in, with crusty looking stalls and mop buckets left to the side. It didn't help that a creepy guy was talking in the stall with the door open at the time. Did I feel have the thought, 'this is how it ends'? Definitely.   Overall, if you're looking for a dining experience involving street-style skewers, Yang's is a solid choice in the Scarborough area. However, I highly suggest you go to the lou before dropping by for a visit."}
{"text":"From the smells of the aromas billowing from this restaurant you'd think it was a BBQ heaven, but alas the dishes served here are mediocre at best.  Our family of four tried three different skewer dishes, the lamb, potato chips and squid.  While the flavours were not bad, the chef basically use the exact same marinating spices, thus giving a nearly identical taste to three different skewered dishes.  Another skewered cornbread patty was dry and tough.  We also tried a fried rice, stirfry vegetable, pork dish and dumpling dish.  All of these dishes were simply middle of the road, nothing bad but nothing outstanding.  Overall lack lustre meal, not worthy of a revisit"}
{"text":"The food is good but the customer service is worse than the sanitation of the washrooms. If you are not Chinese then don't expect and customer service or attention. They won't bother coming to you even if your hand is up unless you call them. I had a terrible experience today when I went.  We ordered by writing the numbers of the menu items we'd like on the paper they gave us. And then when we got the paper back they had changed one of our order numbers from a 14 to an 18 which was clearly visibly changed by somebody as the 8 was poorly changed. I would assume it's because they made the wrong thing and couldn't do anything about it so they decided to finess us since we're a bunch of teenagers. When we kindly told them the situation, the lady started yelling at us in mandarin in an aggressive tone so we decided to just eat the pork feet they accidentally made for us.  That's not end of it though, when we finally asked for the bill separately, they gave us the bill as one instead of the 7-way split that we asked for and refused to split it for us.  And as if that wasn't enough, when we went to pay they refused to even COUNT the money that we put on the tray because it was apparently too much (two $20, a $10, two toonies, and a few quarters) . At this point, we were just confused at the fact that they wouldn't even count the money on the tray, they forced us to tell them the exact amount of money, and then verified it. The funny part is, when we told them exactly how much there was, the lady started COUNTING the MONEY really quickly and finished in like 5 seconds???????!!!!! And then for whatever reason, while we were walking out they started yelling at us DEMANDING FOR EXTRA TIP or they would call the police???? First of all, we are already mad about your customer service and stil tipped you yet you have the audacity to demand extra tip from us and refused to let us leave, probably cause we were teenagers. Fucking ridiculous.   I had a terrible experience here with my friends and I won't be coming here again. The food is not bad though if you don't mind the shitiest customer service in the country. I don't blame all the employees there though and I understand how a restaurant works but the lady and cashier were being very vulgar with us."}
{"text":"Favourite place for skewers. This restaurant used to be very grungy, until they did a upgrade. They need some fans or something to air out all the steam from the grilling, so it could get quite hot and uncomfortable . The place is usually pretty busy and packed. The food comes quick. Great selection for all things grilled. The grilled cabbage is really greasy.. 4 stars for the lamb skewers (I don't even like lamb, but the spice on the skewers is bomb)"}
{"text":"I've heard raving reviews from friends about Yang's and I was so excited to see for myself if it was all true. Turns out, they weren't lying!!   Lamb skewers: I am incredibly bias because I ADOREEEEE lamb skewers and these were perfectly cooked, super tender, with just that right amount of spice to give it a kick without overpowering the meat's flavour. We loved it so much we got a second order.   Octopus tentacles skewers: If you like the tentacles sold at street/night markets like Taste of Asia then you'll definitely like these! They aren't spicy at all so they're great for those who can't handle spice very well.   Eggplant and potato dish: This was a nice filler dish to have, I especially loved the potatoes. I believe the eggplants are breaded in something and fried, so make sure to gobble those up fast because they tend to get soggy and less delicious as time passes which is unfortunate.   Cabbage and seaweed cold dish: This is a fantastic palate cleanser amidst all the strong flavours of Yang's dishes. It's got a mild pickled/vinegar flavour which I found super refreshing. Sadly, I found a fish scale in the dish but it was still very enjoyable!!  Braised beef noodle: What I liked about this was that the soup base wasn't too oily, which is an issue I find with other restaurants. It didn't stand out much to me but that's because I was head over heels for the other noodle bowl we got.   T17: Honestly I don't remember what this was called, but I vaguely remember its menu number so hopefully it's somewhat right! It's a cold sweet and sour soup base with super chewy noodles and it was my second favourite dish after the lamb skewers. I usually don't drink the soup of any noodle bowl, but I drank this up (and then went back for seconds... and thirds).   Beef pancake: Classic beef pancake roll. Beef wasn't too dry and the pancake was still crunchy after sitting on the plate for awhile. Pretty sure this is about as good as it gets!   Overall, the service was pretty disappointing and our dinnerware was questionably clean, but the food was so superb I still had to give this experience a full five stars!! No doubt that I'll be returning again and again to Yang's!"}
{"text":"Got lamb, beef, quail and chicken heart skewers. All were tasty and full of lovely cumin flavour. We got the fish and tofu casserole which was also lovely and my favourite, the lamb soup. We had a simple cabbage, wood ear and carrot veggie dish which was seasoned with numbing pepper oil. Service was quick, food was tasty, overall great experience. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We placed our order and sent it in and we were left waiting for 30minutes. We asked multiple times throughout where our order is but all they mentioned was they would check on it. After 45minutes past, the waiter came telling us they lost our order and wanted us to rewrite it. The service we received was ridiculous and they did not offer any compensations. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly dirty. The tables aren't cleaned properly, the floors are greasy, the washrooms are atrocious.  However, the food is decent but extremely questionable with their lack of hygiene."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best, if not the best place for Chinese lamb skewers in Toronto. The numbing spice mingled with the aroma of cumin cuts into the juicy, fatty lamb meat for an explosion of flavours in your mouth. You can't go wrong with their fried buns & condensed milk, pork belly skewers, or chicken hearts either. Their beef roll wrap has an extra flaky and crispy feel to it compared to the regular wrapping; a must try!  Dumplings are quite good too, once again recommend the lamb. Don't forget to order a couple pitchers of their light and dark beers to combat the spiciness and to maximize the good times."}
{"text":"Must try !!!! Favourite in Toronto!!!!! Both the meats and vegetables very good!!! And it's not very expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Poor Service, and Worst Waitresses who have absolutely no idea what they are doing, food was just average and the worst part is they make constant mistakes on your bills. Please I urge all of you to check your receipt in detail before paying"}
{"text":"If you're up for a spice challenge, then say no more, fam. This place'll have you downing more milk than a malnourished child steady on infamiLL.   I sometimes underestimate how spicy Asians can take their food, and today was no play. My mouth was interrupted, trying to gasp IN air! The more you exhale, it was like a torture chamber; forget about closing yo mouf, foo! Any sip of water or iced tea would only temporarily numb the tingliness; at which point you're actually hoping a negative 12 degree draft comes through that front door to escort the spice out back to Hell.  ...On a calmer note, the service was okay other than being ignored half the time - at least they helped us with our dead grill that malfunctioned 3 times. I keeps count.  Food-wise, the lamb skewers to me were the best. I love how spiced they are but they are TOO lit for me. The meat, lettuce, and veggies were a good amount for my guest and I, and #M7 on the menu was sauce. Btw, I'm still pissed at my friend for dropping one of the skewers. That poor floor probably corroded by now..  My only concern was the closeness of the table if you're using the portable grill bc that shit will melt your eyebrows off and potentially burn you if your items are oily. I assume they use a lower heat to help with this, but even your ex believes there should be a healthy distance."}
{"text":"The bbq here is really good. We tried a couple of kebabs (lamb, shrimp, sausage, gizzards), all really good. I think the price is pretty reasonable. For eg, the lamb kebabs are $4.5 for 3, and come with a fairly generous amount of meat. I'd  say on average you are paying $1-2 per kebab.   Also got a noodle dish which was really flavorful.   The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is that the other dishes were only ordinary. Got the \"dry pot\" beef... it was fine, but nothing special. It was a little expensive too, although there was a lot of meat. Also had another meat dish which was actually only okay. The \"fried eggplant\" dish was actually deep fried, and consisted more of batter than anything else.   So I'd recommend sticking to the bbq dishes.   Also there are a lot of comments about this place being packed at dinner.  It was not packed at all on a weekend lunch though.   Big parking lot. Accepts debit or cash"}
{"text":"First off 6$ pitches FYI  There are many spicy/lamb kabob spots in Toronto, this is by far my favourite. I find they don't use (as much) MSG as other ones, and they have really good dishes, not just cheap lamb kabobs. It can get to be a little spicy but its just south watering delicious! Must try is the lamb of course, the shrimp is also a must try and at 5$ for 6 u can't go wrong, if u really like it spicy try the BBQ chilli peppers 3$ for 3. One of my most favourite dishes is the lamb with noodle, it's under the \"M\" section.  Does get busy and packed up, so be ready to wait if its around dinner time.  Can't complain about the service,all the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I hate Calvin S. despite everything he said his review is true. I wanted to be the first to review, he beat me to it.  My friend's studio is across the street and this is the default place we go to. This is probably the best Chinese Food restaurant that I've been because the offering is so unique from what is offered everywhere. Everything they made was different and good.  The food is very spicy and have heavy spices which I love. We just order from the BBQ menu. This is what we had:  BBQ Mushroom: super delicious and juicy BBQ Dried Tofu: My friend's a vegetarian and ordered this, it was good BBQ Potato Slices: This taste like fresh potato chips, yummy BBQ Sausage: My favourite! Juicy and beefy with a sweet flavour Sooo GOOD! BBQ Chicken: Cooked just right where it's cooked and still juicy. BBQ Whole Shrimp: 4 shrimps on a skewer. Spicy and delicious shrimps  All this for only $31. Would definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the skewers and dumplings here and they were delicious! Highly recommend the beef, chicken and lamb skewers. Some of the beef skewers were a little raw but the lamb skewers were quite fatty which made them very tasty. They all had a spicy kick to them too! You can't go wrong with any of the dumplings either.   The portions here are big for the cheap price. Came here with a group of 8 people and we paid about $15 each but we were stuffed by the end.  Would come again!"}
{"text":"Food here was alright, service was complete garbage though. Stood at the door for a good 10-15 minutes (being the only ones waiting there) and the waiters/waitresses don't even acknowledge your existence.  Head to Tiger BBQ on Alton Tower for a better overall experience yo!"}
{"text":"Yang's is probably one of the best skewer places in the GTA area that I have tried. Their lamb, chicken gizzard, cabbage, sausage, mushrooms skewers.. They are all soo good. Food comes out at a decent rate.   Service on the other hand.. Not exactly the best. It's very very random. Sometimes we have good service from the waiters, sometimes it's just a sloppy mess with bad attitude. Oh and everytime we order rice to go with our skewers. 100% of the time they forget the rice for some reason. Mediocre service aside. The food itself is worth going for.   Def recommend!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but I went here yesterday and ended up with food poisoning.    The service was good but really slow and the food was okay but really salty!   I will certainly not be going back!"}
{"text":"I came here last night and ordered grilled lamb, bean curd, chives, and a garlic stir fried veg dish.  Yes the food was tasty but offset by my fear of how clean the food prep/kitchen was after seeing how the \"clean\" plates they placed at our table when we sat down had leftover food scraps on it.  Also caution that your meat skewers may have bamboo splinters that are lodged in the meat...  Overall, If you don't look too hard at anything and just stick food directly into your mouth when it lands on your table then I'm sure it can be an enjoyable experience because everything is spicy goodness."}
{"text":"If there was 0 star I will. We waited 50 minutes and in between those 50 minutes we asked many many times if our food is done but they just nodded yes and went off. Never got a response and then after 50 min there was one dish that was presented to us. After we asked why that is we waited 59 minutes for one dish, they said they had trouble with their computers but the table next to us and the tables in front of us got many many more food than we did. I would not recommend this place at all to anyone. We also had to pay for the one dish that we didn't even touch because we refused to eat after a long time of waiting and bad service. Do yourself a favor and do not go there."}
{"text":"nice food?the spicy food is very traditional in \"spicy culture\" ... The meat is soft , tender and delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the spots for late night BBQ snacks. Overall it's generally my go to spot. I would say however expect the worse out of this joint.  Food: Late night snacking is the only reason why I go here. Skewers are done nicely while occasionally they can be over seasoned with cumin, while it doesn't bother me, it can be however a turn off for some.   Dumpling are a must with the portion size to be well worth for the price you pay.   Service: Non-existent almost, however there are certain staff that are helpful at times. Service is something you wouldnt bother with at a establishment such as this. Be prepared to have to constantly wave the staff down as they aren't attentive at all.   Ambiance: The place at times can be quite filthy which makes me question why they haven't been busted by the health inspector.   Recommendation: Overall I say go at your own caution. Although I rate this place relatively low in score, that has not deterred me from going to Yang's. I'm just suggesting that what you pay for is literally what you get. Foods not bad though."}
{"text":"This place left a bad taste in my mouth, figuratively and literally. The food is mediocre at best and nothing you won't find else where. I understand that English may have been a language barrier but their demeanors and, frankly, sketchy practices very much justify my 1-star rating.  Starting off with the good stuff to calm my late-night rant. The food was mediocre; however, some items were quite good. The Fried rice with gravy and egg was in the ball park of delicious. As misleading as the name of the item was (there was no gravy), the fried rice was mixed egg and preserved pork belly in a dark soy sauce type sauce - savoury and full of umami flavour, it's guaranteed to satisfy your hunger. Next, the fried tofu in home sauce, the sauce was a gravy accented with the sweetness of onion slices, heat from fresh and dried peppers, and a slight numbing sensation of the Szechwan peppercorn, nothing too unique nor exciting.   Further down the list to my liking is the lamb skewers. I've heard many great things about their skewers, however, I could in good faith say I agree. The 3 skewers I received was vast inconsistent in terms of texture. The flavours were quite good but vastly overshadowed by the terrible texture of the lamb. Not only were many of the skewers, overly chewy, it was riddled with tough connective tissues. Worst was the spicy fried lamb with cumin, in a dish that I could only describe as scraps. The \"meat\" pieces were cut so small that I could not comfortably use the word \"slices\" to describe the cut. Being cut that tiny, one would expect that the meat would be tender, but one would be wrong. The meat was once again a messy mix of tender pieces riddled with solid fat and chewy connective tissue. I could only conclude that this are the pieces that did not make the cut to be included in the skewers. Once again the flavor was good, the toasted cumin, flash cooked onions, and mix of fresh and dried chilli lent a big improvement to the dish. Unfortunately, I refuse to pay $11.99 for onion, chilli, cumin, with a sprinkling of lamb scraps ever again. I was quite underwhelmed and overly disappointed.  Now to the part why we would never consider coming back and what I mean by \"questionable\" practices. Once again, language has nothing to do with the problem. At first entrance, we told them that we are a table of two. The waitress/hostess waved her arm in a multitude of directions without really any acknowledgement of what we said. We followed her general direction only to have to shuffle backward (because there were no table for 2-4 on that side of the restaurant). We barely received service, took awhile to track someone down for the boxes and the bill. Upon paying for the bill at the debit machine, the waitress and waiter took it upon themselves to select the tip type for you. Meaning, instead of letting the customers choose to tip with dollar amount, they preemptively select the % amount. Then the questionable part, lowest being 12%...listed in the order of 15% then 12% then 20%, which makes no logical sense. What pissed me off is not the amount being tipped, because the amount is negligible between 1-5%, however, it is the principal of the matter. Resorting to such sneaky and underhanded tactics does not make me a happy customer.   Overall, food is barely passable. We will not return for the reasons listed above. It is worth noting that it is ones of the places that is opened relatively late on a weekday, in the area. Next time, I'd rather skip supper than return, or travel a little further for food. Not worth the headaches or frustration returning here."}
{"text":"$2 home brewed beer and smoked BBQ lamb skewer!  They have two beer that they make In house. Golden or dark. It's by no mean at the same level as store bought beer, but if it's cheap and \"kinda\" unique.  The light really shines, when it comes to their lamb skewer. Nicely spiced and juicy as heck.  Their grilled cabbage isn't bad either. It's plain and simple, but flavourful. Just a tad oily, than what I would like normally.  I'll come back for more lamb skewers for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for a while, and it was a pretty famous place back in the day. The restaurant seem to have been sold to another owner, and gone through some renovations. It still has the same menu essentially. however its style of spice is different then before.   The Food at this place is a Chinese bbq style, but it is also famous for dry pot style food, and other food. This restaurant is known for convenient opening times and generally decent food. The food is not mind blowing but has always been decent. i feel that the spices change has made it not as good as before in terms of its bbq, however the dishes are pretty much same as before. the bbq cabbage and bbq lamb are usually the best part of this restaurant and if you are to try it, than i would recommend those two.   The Service at this place was always not good, but it has gotten progressively worse now since the change in renovations, and on top of it the waiters can only speak mandarin, not english not cantonese. just mandarin. So that is probably why they request customers write down their own orders. since their menu has english. This place also does not take credit, and only cash.   The service and the lowering in spices is what made it lost scores. and has one of the worst services, even by chinese restaurant standards."}
{"text":"I've been here few years ago and it wasn't bad so I decided to try it out again . The sour soup, meat was pretty good. The draft beer is really cheap but you shouldn't drink it all the time. Not a very genuine beer. The place is normal line northern Chinese restaurant. It opens late a night."}
{"text":"My bf and I were craving Chinese BBQ and didn't feel like going to our usual BBQ joint so we decided to try this place out. We were here at 9pm and it was busy but turnover is pretty quick.   We ordered a couple dishes to share: lamb skewers, chicken skewer, Taiwan sausage skewer, eggplant, and shredded potato. The food was good and everything was nicely seasoned, not too salty but it was really spicy for me. My bf has a higher tolerance than me but he found the lamb to be spicy.   While the food was pretty good, this place is literally a hole in the wall. The floor had random wet spots here and there, and wasn't clean looking. The plates and utensils felt greasy but I guess that's pretty standard with a lot of Asian restaurants.   I probably will come back once I build a better tolerance for spice because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food and busy atmosphere for drinks and bbq with friends.   We ordered a bit of everything: cumin lamb stir fry dish, pork belly hot plate, lamb and quail skewers, a vegetable dish, shredded cold potato, and the caramelized sweet potato dish for dessert.  Hands down, the skewers and hot plate were the most memorable. Things are spicy, but not more spicy than say a Korean or Indian or Szechuan place. I have to say, the non-bbq items really help to round out the meal so don't skimp on the shredded potato or beer! The caramelized sweet potato desert is a must-try, too!  Only real complaint is that the service was mediocre - but what do you expect at a Chinese joint?"}
{"text":"Summary: late night hit spot gets it right with skewers.  If you're looking for skewers and just skewers - this is good. Lamb has that gamey taste that I love, mixed with a solid amount of seasoning. It's definitely got some kick to it too. Beef was delicious.  Keep in mind: you're not here for the decor, or for the service staff (they're pretty much like robots here), or for the environment (not exactly dirty, but not exactly shining with confidence in cleanliness either). You're here for the skewers, and a good time with friends.  Great portions too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Chinese bar b q. The lamb is fantastic. Came here for lunch. It was busy but the service was still very good."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was that it was really crowded and busy. Although this place was kinda small, there was a line that started from the cash and it went out the door. So I assumed it would be really good place to eat since my brother recommended it. I WAS WRONG. SERVICE: While I was standing in line, I noticed that some servers were not very kind to the customers. A certain server blamed the customer in front of me for being in their way when there wasn't much space to move around already, and the server didn't even ask the customer to move beforehand.. When I got seated, the table beside me was being cleared and another certain waiter was pretty aggressive while she did her job. While she was piling the dishes, the sauces and liquids flew onto my leg. I wasn't pleased about this because it didn't looked like she wanted to work there. Service after we ordered the food was decent. But the wait for the bill was horrible. We had to wait about 20 mins for the bill after pressing the service button 'x' amount of times, then waited for another 10 mins before I got fed up and walked to the cash register to pay. FOOD: The food was pretty good. Probably the only thing convincing me to give a two star rating. We ordered the steamed dumplings and some skewers. The grilled food was perfectly seasoned. Most of the foods here are spicy; so if you aren't a big fan of spice, the dumplings would be an option. They were a tad salty but juicy and not over cooked. The pricing is a bit expensive for the skewers and steamed dumplings. Overall, service was horrible but food was decent. I would give this place another chance if service changes."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Great choice for late night snacks. It's a bit on the expensive side but the food is really good. I especially like the lamb skewers. If you can't handle spicy, be warned. The food here is generally spicy and caters to those with that tongue.   Food (4/5):  The food is great. I really like spicy foods, and this place caters to just that. I personally recommend the lamb skewers, as well as the chicken skewers. I believe the skewers come in 3s and you'll be looking at spending around $3.99 - $4.99 per set. Again, it's a bit expensive but I think it's pretty worth, especially if you're going out late night and your choices are limited. It might also be smart to cool off the heat with a nice cold Arizona, but you'll be set back another $1.99 or so.  Hours (4.5/5):  This place is amazing if you're hungry at night and got a few friends to chill with. It's not really packed when you go after 11pm, and there will always be seats. The service isn't the best, but you can't expect much when the people here work for such long hours. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some small snacks past midnight and if you're around the area!  ------- Overall (4/5)"}
{"text":"We have a love and hate relationship with this restaurant. Have been going here for a couple of years   The food was good and the price is very cheap. However except rude service and when they are busy cleanliness is not their top priority.   We always order the BBQ skewers - lamb, beef, pork belly, BBQ Korean cabbage and steamed dumplings with hot and sour soup.   Out last visit was not good. One of our bowl that was brought to us was unwashed with leftover food from the previous customer.    The floor was dirty with napkins and not clean."}
{"text":"Dirty as hell... Used to come here back in the day when it was more run down. Service was even a bit better. After renovations the service went to shit. Servers always slamming dishes, spills and breaking things. When asking for server to order they repeat everything back to you in Mandarin even if you speak in English. Or one of the servers spoke to us in Mandarin and we spoke English she was so rude and interrupted and called another server. I witnessed one if the servers drop a couple of spoons on the ground and she threw it back into the drawer. The fish in the tank that they cook were in jerky water (killing/cooking them is probably better than them living in that crap). The only make server is rude and doesn't pay attention when ordering. We were not done ordering and he walked off few steps, we fully tried to call him and he just ignored. Dirty utensils.. the garbage pails to put the skewer sticks in were dirtyy, never cleaned after each customer.. disgusting. Don't think I'll ever come back. You think after renovations it would be cleaner... But I would never bring anyone here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday around 1.30pm for 3 people and there were plenty of tables, though I hear it gets busy at night which is how I got intrigued by this place. The interior is quite grey with a mix of out of place trendy lamps vs. cheap chairs and bags of kleenex on the table, I couldnt decide what kind of place it was when I walked in. The tea cups were also a bit dirty and stained, and its your standard no smile asian service BUT the food was good and felt authentic.   We got the lamb and chicken gizzard skewers - they were spicy and seasoned and cooked nicely not chewy at all. The lamb ribs were fall off the bone soft on the inside and had a crispy crust on the outside but not for people who like greasy foods, it was pork belly fat like. The grilled buns were also amazing, the bread is soft and fluffy and the exterior was crispy and crunchy. The grilled corn was ok, skippable. Saw another table eating a large plate of grilled sausages though and they looked delicious and wish I got them.  We also got the beef pancake roll, it came out piping hot and fresh, the pancake was not chewy and wish they had just a bit more sauce on the inside but one of the best I've had. The pork dumplings are ok, the meat filling had a strong meat flavour (not regular bland ground pork mush) but the dumpling wrapper was a bit dry. It was also a large serving of dumplings, it came in a steamer with about 12/15. For all these dishes the bill came up to be $32 before tips. As everyone said the food is on the oily side but its almost expected from this kind of cuisine. Will definitely be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"Tremendously tasty and well priced, with fast and courteous service. Try the lamb and chicken skewers and the cabbage. It's all BBQ goodness with an unforgettable spice.   A+"}
{"text":"Skewers and dumplings. These are great combos, and this is THE go-to spot for me and my friends when we're depressed and sad about our school marks. If you want a pick me up, go here, as the oily goodness that is lamb skewers, cabbage and pork dumplings will bound to cheer you up.  In terms of customer service, not THE greatest, but I have a motto in life: the worse the customer service is in Chinese restaurants, the food is seemingly better.   The food also comes very quickly, so you don't have to wait too long. The place is open until 2:00 AM too. In terms of pricing, it's quite reasonable, and when split between 2-3 people, very doable. I usually order 4 things from the menu and split with one other person, and the bill usually comes up to $15-$20, with filling portions."}
{"text":"In the midst of all the Chinese restaurants in this plaza Yangs was great. If you're looking for good affordable authentic Chinese food without the fancy schmancy decor then you've made a Good choice. I had their noodles, and dumplings and it passed my taste buds test with flying colors."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and had the Sichuan fish hot pot, jellyfish, fried spicy cabbage, cold cucumbers and lamb skewers.   I quite enjoyed everything, especially the fish.  However, the next day, there was fire, if you know what I mean ;-). The $7 pitchers were a nice touch! I was the only laowai there but it's all good ;-)"}
{"text":"The area is pretty old but I must say the food really impressed me.   If you want to get a seat, you will have to get there before 7pm or else you will be lining up at the door.   I had the bbq lamb kebab with spice on top. That's the most delicious BBQ skewer I have. Its almost like the ones at the Markham night market. Also had the cucumber and chicken cold salad dish. Amazing with peanut flavors. The next thing I will rave on is the skewered cabbage.   The waitress and waiters really made them lose those two stars on my review as I thought they were quite rude and slow to react. They make it look like they are so busy running around but if you take a closer look, they aren't really doing much. Not only are they rude, they really just don't care that you have your hand up for a few minutes just to get a table set for a friend because they miscalculated. The manager is practically tunnel visioned and won't respond to you. The younger waiters are a little better about it.   They only speak Taiwanese or Mandarin so they don't understand English or Cantonese which is kind of frustrating for those who don't speak the language."}
{"text":"Yang's BBQ is one of my go to spots for Chinese BBQ! It is a plus that they open late. This restaurant is popular for Chinese BBQ and there may be a 30-45mins wait during peak dinner time.   The atmosphere of this restaurant is casual. It is a great place for cheap food and drinks. Service is minimal. It is your typical no frills Chinese restaurant for quick food.   Service: The service is minimal here. Don't expect servers to check up on you because they will not. Every table is given utensils and a pot of tea so everything is pretty much self-serve. If you do need a waiter, you will need to put the extra effort to get their attention.   Food: I generally come for the BBQ items and I love the seasoning. Most items are quite spicy. It is a great BBQ spot if you like eating spicy. The skewers goes well with beer and most people would order beer with the food. There is a wide selection of skewers so I try to order different items every time I am here. But there are a few items that I must get every time including the lamb, beef, gizzard, and cabbage. I also really like to order some cold appetizer dishes because it is nice to have something refreshing when you are eating a lot of hot spicy skewers.   Yang's BBQ remains my go to spot for Chinese BBQ. I do think they can improve on the customer service though."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night around 9pm and it was packed. Actually really great food though (my stomach is making noises now) and decent service for a Chinese restaurant.    Me and my party of 4 mainly ordered from the skewers/BBQ part, which was THE BOMB and definitely would recommend if you're coming here.   Favourite: - Beef: good meaty pieces with only a bit of fat. - Sausage: sweet and savoury mmmm - Korean Cabbage: and not it's not Kim Chi. They drench the cabbage in the spices so what seems like is healthy is so not which is perfect.   Those were my favourite three, but honestly everything else was amazing. The only thing I would stray away from are 1. Oysters and 2. Eggplant. You can taste the frozen in the oyster.   Oh and warning, I LOVE spicy. So this was the perfect amount for me and I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"4 star for BBQ. 3.0 for others. The BBQ is real Chinese BBQ , taste very good!  And the place is noisy and dirty..be prepared to wait since there is only one waitress, at least when we were there from 5:30 to 6:45. Love the BBQ beef , wings is ok, not as good as those I had in China.  They added fish and concentrated crab stick in the blood cake, this is the first time I saw seafood cook with the blood cake...so strange...but taste ok, very spicy.  Don't like the baked oyster at all....no taste.... Will come back for the BBQ only."}
{"text":"Overall a 3.5, food is a solid 4  Hands down my favourite skewers/Chinese BBQ place! Everything is super flavourful and marinated well. I've been here a few times now and my go-to orders are the lamb/beef/pork/pork belly/Korean cabbage skewers, cucumber cold dish, and tomato beef stew with enoki mushrooms. I ask for mild and the heat is already kicking in!  In terms of service, my rating would be a 2.5-3/5. I find that when I'm sitting outside where everyone else is, the service is better than when I'm stuck sitting in one of their rooms in the car back corner where no one ever pays attention to you. It would take forever to flag them down!!! Like the other reviewers have mentioned, if you don't know mandarin, don't come here cause everyone here speaks mando and prob one guy who speaks little english.   They also give out plastic forks that are so bendy and hard to eat???"}
{"text":"The BBQ was average. We like the seasoning and sauces they put on to the meat. The eggplants are also good. We also ordered the fried tofu and chives. However, they were not barbecued but more like spoiled."}
{"text":"This place is a go to place for my group of friends. There's so much variety on the menu and the bbq here is amazing.   This is a place to go for a relatively cheap and very filling and satisfying meal. The more people the merrier has you can try more items on the menu.   Don't expect a high level of service or think about sanitation though.."}
{"text":"This place is just a fucking disaster. The staff was rude, made fun of us the entire time, and didn't serve us. They also asked us why we didn't leave a \"high\" enough tip for their bullshit behavior."}
{"text":"Great place for lamb skewers! Sometimes I drive 20 km just to come here for dinner! The cumin flavour is spot on, though it can get quite spicy. The beef noodles is great as well, though it is a bit on the oily side. Portions are quite good so you won't leave starving. The dumplings are just ok, I think it is better at other restaurants.. I would say this restaurant is best for the skewers if you can handle the heat! Great place for groups as everything is sharable."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of the Midland-Finch plaza, this place caters to mainly Mainlanders, but the servers do speak both Cantonese and Mandarin.  Noise is quite loud, especially after 10pm when all the students come in.  In terms of the food though, it was generally delicious. The skewers though were a little bit on the tough side, though the amount of herbs they add is a rather nice addition.  The beef on sizzling hot plate was one of the best I've had, and I generally dislike hot plates due to the fact I always seem to get it overcooked. This one was cooked perfectly, not too hard, and we managed to just finish it, so portions were excellent.  Very good service as well, though you sometimes have to yell across to get their attention."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here the last couple of times I came. The atmosphere feels like it's a hole-in-the-wall kind of restaurant. The tables and surroundings don't look all that clean, and the wait staff aren't very attentive, but the BBQ food is delicious.   Whenever I come here, I get the BBQ skewers and dumplings..very flavourful. I've ordered spicy chicken before but we didn't realize there were bones so it wasn't as enjoyable. I have a feeling that some of the dishes are a hit and miss like many Chinese restaurants. I  think that if you come here, you should stick with what's best--the BBQ dishes..and maybe something you're familiar with.  One thing I had an issue with was their beef and onion pancake roll. The first time I had it was great, but the second time was a total miss. It's like they reduced the amount of meat and just gave me an onion pancake roll. I was disappointed with that and would never order it there again. If you're looking for a good beef and onion pancake roll, I'd suggest Asian Legend."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese style BBQ and I totally remind me of home. They have all kinds choices there such as chicken breasts, wings, chives, string mushrooms, tofu etc. The only warning is that most of stuff there is spicy...so make sure you could handle spice. Soy milk seems to be a good drink to dilute spice!!"}
{"text":"Yang's serves some of the best and cheapest food around. Unfortunately they have some of the least helpful and optimistic staff in the area. If you don't receive attitude you will be receiving nothing at all. The queuing has no system what so ever. Truly the Wild West of seating in restaurants.   What keeps bringing me back is the food & cheap beers."}
{"text":"This place is great to get your BBQ greasy food fixing. The beer on tap is undeniably cheap and the taste is a true testament to the price, also cheap.   I've tried most of the skewers and they all taste good. The price is also very fair. The downsides are service and cleanliness. They are understaffed and often times I doubt whether the cups we are using has been washed thoroughly but hey, you didn't come here expecting Shangri-La ambience did you? Come for the food, stay for the beer and look forward to the bloated stomach and a good time."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I would have given it five stars if I haven't been here this time. The flavor changed and the service was not good. We ordered Preserved Egg and Tofu, but it was really weird which is for sure different from any preserved egg and tofu I had before both in China and here in Canada. Even the Boiled green bean shocked me since it should be a very simple dish you'll never make it wrong, but actually it didn't taste fresh at all. And we didn't get any water or tea after we got our seat."}
{"text":"Came here about 3 times now for the BBQ and I have to say, their BBQ is highly addictive!   My all-time favourites are chicken cartilage, cabbage, mushroom and lamb skewer. Love how the portion is not too big if you have someone to share with; the BBQs are lightly spiced but you can still taste the natural flavour of your food!   Service is not the best but it's alright given that the restaurant is always extremely busy! But my advice for you is to either call in to make a reservation if you have a big group or go there around 4-5pm on a weekend before it gets too crowded!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a no frills, quick service, reasonable price chinese northern bbq place, this is the place for you. The restaurant is quite full on a Monday evening. Considering all the restaurants that popped up around finch midland area, most of the restaurants are not doing as well as before, but this place is standing strong through all the competition.  All of our food came really fast. The dish that all of us enjoyed the most (even more than The lamb skewers and beef roll wrap) is bbq cabbage. As a meatatrian, this dish is better than all the other pork, poultry, lamb, beef dishes we ordered in the meal! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Late night Northern Chinese BBQ restaurant in Scarborough.  The BBQ skewers are excellent. Whole shrimp, beef, lamb, chicken gizzards, etc.. are all cooked nicely and spiced with a Northern Chinese spice mix.  Very good value from about $4-$6 on most items. Some of the other dishes however were lacking and disappointing such as the beef roll wraps and dumplings. Service was quick. A pitcher of draft beer is really cheap at $7 for any drinkers out there, but this leads to a rowdy drunk and loud late night crowd which diminishes the restaurant experience.  Most likely different from a day crowd but we came late around midnight and restaurant closes at 2 am so had this experience. The other negative is that he place is not the cleanness around as lots of bamboo skewers and napkins and stuff on the floor."}
{"text":"The food was good and spicy.  But the service is terrible.  They act like they can't understand English.  We ordered a pitcher of Lager and they gave us a dark beer.   Don't bother asking any questions about the menu.  Not helpful at all."}
{"text":"Legit recommend this place!  Came here for a late night Chinese Style BBQ after drinks. Price is good and food is good!  Small draft pitchers are $5.99  Lamb Skewers - 3.5 stars! Could have cooked on the BBQ for a minute more and it the lamb had a bit more fat then it would be 4.5 stars ($3.99 for 3 Skewers).  Soft bone chicken was 4 stars, I miss these extra large size soft bones.. hard to find this size at most other Chinese BBQ restaurants.  The \"Water Cook Fish\" for $10.99 (small size) was legit and authentic - 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food, terrible service. I'm a frequent visitor of Yang's BBQ, and I'm never disappointed by the food, but the service can't get any worse. The BBQ lamb, beef, and cabbage skewers are very tasty, and are ordered each time I visit.  Would highly recommend this restaurant to others, as long as you aren't bothered by rude servers and terrible service. The food really is very delicious, so if they were to improve their attitudes to customers, I'm sure they would get more 5-star ratings."}
{"text":"Northern-style skewers: super spicy, super oily, and pretty darn addictive. My favourite were the lamb skewers. Even though everything is basically seasoned the exact same way, the cumin and chilli meshed especially well with lamb. The potato spirals are also fun, and break up the monotony of all the meat dishes. Paired with cheap beer on tap, this is a fun late-night place to hit up for snacks and conversation."}
{"text":"Yangs is known for going for late nights and enjoying a couple of beers since alcohol is cheap here and the skewers is a perfect pairing while drinking. Majority of the staff here only speak a bare minimal of English so I spoke mandarin to them even though I have a hard accent. The staff here were very patient and they appreciated the fact I made effort to speak in their language. It gets super busy at night so sometimes it's hard to wave anyone down to get their undivided attention. However though, once your orders put into the system food comes in within the ten minutes the orders put in!   When it comes down to the food I have had better skewers elsewhere. I find that it's super salty but I will always enjoy their Korean cabbage! It's a staple everytime I step into yangs. Their noodles in soups are also amazing but the rest of the food on the menu is only decent. I come back once in awhile when I'm craving for a quick skewer/dumplings fix!  They only accept cash and debit, keep that in mind !"}
{"text":"I only come here for the BBQ lamb skewers and BBQ Chinese cabbage. That stuff is off the hook. The lamb skewers here are the cheapest that you will find in Toronto. I think it was $4.50 for 3 lamb skewers. You probably won't find this price anywhere else and if you do, let me know.  The service is like any other mainland Chinese restaurants, wave your hand for service or if you need anything. At least, in this restaurant, most of the waiters understand English since I speak Cantonese as my second language. Some of the waiters were rude to my friend but we just laughed it off. I don't expect amazing service in these types of restaurants. I just expect them to serve me my food quickly and I feel like that is what most Chinese restaurants do.   They renovated a while ago and the place is way more spacious than before and not as suffocating.   I'm giving this 5 stars because compared to every other Chinese BBQ, this place is probably the best in terms of value. It makes sense as well since this restaurant has been opened for the longest compared to the rest."}
{"text":"Okay....  good spot to goto late night after drinking. But yesterday I went during the day. And it was horrible. Muscles made me sick. Food was not fresh at all....   staff didn't care.  (Not like you come here for service. But it was worse than usual). Andddddd. Filthy!!!!!! Everything about it was filthy. Table. Seats. Washrooms. Even the walls were covered in gunk. And the device to call your server...  was completely plastered in god knows what. Like they've never wiped anything down ever. Makes me really question their kitchen...... so many small simple things they could have done to make it okay....  and they neglected that. I wonder what corners were cut while cleaning the kitchen....  the floors had caked on junk in all corners. How did they pass health code?  Good god!  Nope and wipe down once in a while!!   I would have given it one star. Except I had many fun late nights there when the sun wasn't out to show me the light"}
{"text":"Cash only  The seasoning on skewers is frigging delicious and not too spicy. I love the lamb skewers! Nice and juicy, not gamey.  The quail was good too but a lot of work to eat it so I'd skip it if you're lazy like me.  I didn't like the pork belly or chicken."}
{"text":"We keep coming back to this place for bbq skewers even there are other similar bbq restaurants closer to home.  Tasty flavor and reasonable prices.  Lamb skewers are my all time favorite and my son loves the sausages (cuz it's on the sweet side). I also recommend the shrimp skewers.   Stir fried noodles are on the oily side. But you can ask them to less oil and it'll be perfect."}
{"text":"Great for late night and cheap eats. I always order a few Lamb, Beef, and Chicken Skewers along with the Beef Wrap and a plate of \"Jellyfish With Dressing\".   The Beef Wrap is quite heavy with its thick flatbread (probably the same one used for \"Scallion Pancakes\"), so it's a great choice if you are looking to eat on a budget and be full. It comes with a good proportion of beef. Depending on the day, sometimes you get less meat but I never found it to ruin the taste of the wrap.  The spiciness of the skewers is too much for me to handle but I torture myself eating them because it tastes so good; the spice is where the flavour is at!! My friend recommended the Jellyfish dish and it really helps with that fire in your mouth. The cold temp, oiliness, and saltiness with a hint a sweet comes together nicely in this super flavourful dish.   This place isn't the most clean but the food is tasty. Service wise, it's so so. They have a button system for orders, water refills, etc. so that really helps get their attention.   Sorry for the lack of pictures, I'm always so hungry I just eat right when the food comes!  NOTE: If you order more than 9 skewers, the ones at the bottom are going to be slightly less seasoned (I think they just pile everything onto the plate THEN add the seasoning).  You can always ask for more seasoning if you bite into a skewer that doesn't burn your tongue off."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars.  The good: This restaurant is opened late at night, until 2 am! I came here around 9:30 for a snack. The prices are pretty cheap. Most of the skewers are not per order, but come in 3s so it's great for a group.   The bad: The lamb is good here, but I've tasted better elsewhere. And also, their seasoning is very spicy. I needed water and and a cold drink. This place doesn't look like the cleanest place but still passes."}
{"text":"The place is a little dirtier than I'd like, but sometimes those are the spots with the best grub. I also like how they have tissues on the side of each table to use.  Food is good, their lamb skewers may not be up to par with xin Jiang, but their beef is much better. They have a lot of reasonably priced variety. Beef skewers, grilled cabbage, and pork belly skewers are my go-to times."}
{"text":"i have a history with this place. it used to be a ghetto little shop that had $10 all u can eat skewers, and $6 pitchers of watered down beers. it was amazing. it wasn't long after a group of friends and i came here for my birthday where about 6 of us had 40 skewers each, that they ended up shutting down renovating a bit and rebranding, which sadly resulted in the $10 all you can eat deal was no more. now, it's a la carte so it's a bit more expensive, but the taste is still the same. you get that grimey street food taste and feeling, oily, greasy, and unhealthy as hell. but it still tastes so good. so much spices and cumin. everything kinda has a similar flavour to it so u can easily get sick of the flavours lol. but, oddly enough. i still like this place for what it is."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. The lamb bbq and dumplings were amazing. There pitcher of light beer is perfect accompaniment to the food and at 7 bucks is a steal. Very simple place and nothing fancy but a must go if you are in Scarborough. Service was quick and friendly. Good price , awesome food, must try !"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, they scored all over the map and I apparently got the short end of the stick.  When I first arrived, the wait staff just ignored me... I was standing there for a good 10 minutes before being acknowledged... then another 10 minutes pass and had to request for a menu... I can guess quite well but not when ordering food off a phantom menu.  I was finally able to flag down a waitress to give my order to, collected the menus and thought the appetizers would come out lickety split....  half hour later (getting close to the 1 hour mark now after sitting), and still no food.  Ask the servers about the order and when they return, informed they never received an order form... WTF???  They just gave us menus again and said order again... seriously should have just left.  Put in the order... 15 mins pass and first item comes out and every 5 mins another dish arrives... kitchen manager/ expediter truly sucks at their job.  The foods were temperature I give them that but all dishes were over salted... maybe to boost their beer sales.  All in all a very meh experience and not a big fan of \"cash only\" for meals that easily top $50+ for a 2 too."}
{"text":"6$ pitchers!  Not your regular domestic beer,  from a microbrewery but the quality doesn't lose out. The place is a little dirty but if you're only there for the food I've never gotten sick from them before... The lamb skewers, vegetable soup,  and home made dumpling is a must try! Be careful of  the juices of the dumpling though,  it will burn your tongue."}
{"text":"On contrary to Yelp reviews, this was one of the worst restaurants I've come across. We came here during the evening after dinner on a weekend so it was a full-house without a line up. The waitresses seemed ignored us as we waited at the door while we were waiting even after tables were cleared and people left. After waiting for 10 mins and no acknowledgement, I stopped a waitress and asked if we could get a table. She rudely told us to follow her and wait which ended up causing us to awkwardly stand in the middle of the restaurant for another 10 minutes. She finally sat us down in the corner of the restaurant which had a sticky, wet table. Of course, she didn't bother to wipe it down for us.  Because we were sat down in the front corner of the restaurant, a line that formed at the entrance blocked our views from the waitresses so it was difficult to call to their attention to begin our ordering. We ordered several beef, lamb, and chicken wing skewers. Despite the many reviews here, the skewers were average in taste. One of the skewers was dropped from the plate onto our table as it was being served to us. Unsurprisingly, the waitress picked it up and tried to serve it to a different customer.  Due to the unpleasant and rude service that was provided, we decided to not leave a tip. After paying for our order at the front and leaving, the waitress called us back and showed me the bill saying that they were missing a tip from us. Very shameless of her to ask for one if she acted like she didn't want a tip the entire time!"}
{"text":"Came here for some skewers because it looked pretty popular and I was really craving Chinese BBQ. We waited for fifteen minutes after we ordered and asked the waitress when our food would get here and she said she would check. 15 minutes later we still had nothing and we thought it was just a busy night until we noticed a table that came way later than we did get their food so we asked another waiter for our food. He proceeded to check the system and said they lost our ordering sheet and asked us to reorder. During all of this we saw him sit down with some customers to drink beer so... Thanks."}
{"text":"I enjoy spicy food and skewers, so I think I'll return here in the future. The funny thing is, I came with a friend who has great difficulty eating spicy foods.   The menu here is quite extensive, but they are known for their bbq (obviously since it's in their name). My friends and I tried the beef skewers which were very good, but the other items we ordered were just average. Still tasty, but didn't have me racing to come back. We tried some of their stove top bbq, but the pork didn't have much flavour, forcing us to rely on the sauces for any. The menu said it came with rice and soup, but we didn't receive any of that until we inquired about it (the waitress looked confused actually). The soup was super spicy, but I liked it even though I couldn't drink much of it. My friend took a tiny sip and chugged down a glass of water. I love bringing him to places like this.  We also ordered their lamb dumplings. They were standard, but I have another restaurant that I think prepares them much better. There was also no soy sauce or vinegar at our table (though I could see some across the room at another table).  The friend who can't handle spicy food ordered the beef rolls (the ones wrapped in foil). That's one of his favourite dishes, and although he said these were okay, he preferred other restaurants for it. I tried a little and thought the dough was too thick while the stuffing didn't have enough flavour.  I don't know why my friend got this, but she wanted to try the fried bread (mantou). It tasted exactly how you think it tasted. Probably would've been better with a little condensed milk.   Despite my nitpicking, this restaurant is quite popular. I was lucky I came in a very small group because the place was packed. I did enjoy my experience and I would return, but I might also want to try out other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place, we went here on a date before tying the knot later. The lamb skewer always have me craving for more... it was just that good. Many times in the night like 10:30pm we would drive all the way across city to come here for couple skewers, if your mandarin is as rusty as mine, better just speak English, no need to embarrass yourself in front of your date. The other skewers are good too. But lamb and also Pork belly stood out from the crowd."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of good szechuan cooking.. and this place is.. really good. They have a big variety of menu items making it hard to choose what to eat. We had lamb skewers, chicken gizzard skewers, fried spicy chicken bone-in, spicy cold noodles, and spicy 'water-boiled fish'. All the dishes had very good flavouring and portions were large. The grilled items were seasoned generously. There were large quantity of szechuan peppercorn in the dishes which I love. The prices were also affordable. A great place for anyone looking for amazing spicy Chinese food"}
