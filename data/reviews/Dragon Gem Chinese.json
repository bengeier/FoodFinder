{"text":"One of the better Chinese food choices in the area. Consistently good Chinese food delivered at reasonable prices. They will keep your address and orders on file for quick, easy ordering.  Good place if you live in the area or are just passing through."}
{"text":"Our usual go-to for Chinese in Pickering.  Food: Tasty. Simple Chinese, though I'm not sure what region/style - most likely somewhere mainland...? Pardon my ign'ance. I like the crab rangoon - little fried wonton wrappers with a cream cheese-like filling. Sounds gross, I know. But I like gross. Beef dishes are tasty - I believe it's the beef ho feng we typically end up getting...? But I'm known to screw up the name sometimes...  Service: Pretty nice staff. Always fast. Have never had an order mix-up in the 10 years or so we've been going here.  Price: Reasonable. What you would normally expect for take-out Chinese.  I gave it a four-star mostly because of the decently tasty fare, and the nice staff."}
{"text":"I have bought food from this restaurant on a few occasions. I have found their food to be tasty and not very greasy. Today though I experienced poor customer service from the person at the front counter who left me and my family waiting for quite a while even though she saw us enter the restaurant. When she finally came to take our order there was no \"sorry for keeping you waiting\". I think she lacked respect for us and our time. We bought lunch specials which just turned out to be mostly rice and a bit of meat or vegetables. I would not advise anyone to buy these specials. What you pay for is a lot of rice."}
{"text":"Food is good. Portions are enough for two meals, but that's the norm with Chinese takeaway."}
{"text":"We have ordered Chinese food from Dragon's Gem on several occasions in the past couple of months.   The food here is by far the best Chinese food I have ever had.  If you love BBQ pork ribs you need to try the ones from here. The are not those small ones that you would get from elsewhere but man-sized.  The Egg Rolls, Egg Foo Young, General Tao chicken in addition to everything else we have are worth ordering.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because the last two times we have ordered delivery there have been some mistakes - that said they did correct them.  This is the only place to order Chinese in Pickering."}
{"text":"All I've ever eaten here is the General Tso chicken. I don't think there needs to be anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I love their General Tao Chicken Combo C7. Kinda greasy but what did you expect from Chinese food takeout? Their other stuff are good too but gets pricey when you venture away from the combos. C7 FTW"}
{"text":"Stopped going after 20 years.  Food was almost always good.  Last visit was soo bad I have determined the will NEVER EVER see another $ of my money.  How dare you accuse a customer of eating food and trying to get a credit, especially after 2 of 3 things ordered were wrong!  You never asked me anything..just ready to accuse!  Worst customer service I have seen!  Cost me $30 for next to  nothing.  Cost of learning never to do business with them again!"}
{"text":"always great and always consistant with friendly owner and staff"}
{"text":"this  ( dragon gem Chinese restaurant ) seems to be a duplicate listing for \"dragon gem Chinese\" minus the word \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Good food, delivered quickly, and accepts credits cards. Not too greasy."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house and we have been going there since we moved here in 2004.  They are nothing special but the food is good and servings are nice and large.  They have the usual line-up of Chinese dishes but the quality is one of the best I have had for a take-out place.  The specials are reasonable and the combos include fried rice and an egg roll.  Customizing the regular dishes is no problem either."}
{"text":"I love this place, best chinese food in pickering with huge portions of food the only downside...which isnt their fault really is the amount of school kids around lunch hour, but its a good sign the place crowded.  the price is fair and generous amounts of food is given, id recommend the general tso's chicken, deep fried crab meat sticks and the rangoons"}
{"text":"The wife asked that I try out a friend's suggestion for Chinese food.   I ordered the standard meal and the price was a bit more $6.00 before taxes.   I had the spring rolls.  Very tasty and a decent size The BBQ spareribs.  The bones were meaty but I am not a fan of the sauce on them.  I prefer my ribs dry.  I had the bbq pork fried rice.  Was tasty and a hit with the wife too We had the beef with broccoli.  I could have had more beef in my portion and if you like but not love garlic then give this dish a pass The General Tao chicken. Simply amazing.    The menu item I did get but was told to always get are their chicken balls.  My wife said they were crispy with not too much batter.  Next time.   The wait for the meal was fine even for a busy Friday night.  All in all a decent but pricy dinner for two."}
{"text":"After owning a business in Pickering for the last 5 years, I decided to try out Dragon Gem Chinese food the other day. Had the seafood soup with steamed rice and an order of Cantonese Chow Mein. Their food was incredible!! Talk about massive portions!! I highly recommend this diamond in the rough and would even drive from my home in York Region to pick up from here!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good to start... until later in that evening both my boyfriend and I have been up all night vomiting!"}
{"text":"It's okay food.  Nothing special.  C7 is the only thing that I've ever ordered there.  Oh, and Won Ton soup."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place to anyone. My wife and I got sick from their food! It's been 2 days now and we are still sick!   Please focus on delivering excellent service and follow proper food preparation and safety."}
{"text":"Best Chinese, but can get pricy fast.  Love the crab Rangoon.  Sometimes you have to wait when you walk in so I recommend ordering a head of time for pick up."}
{"text":"Dragon Gem Chinese is located in the Metro Plaza at Whites and Strouds lane, on the opposite end as the actual Metro in the corner. I've eaten here a number of times but that was many years ago, so it seemed like a good place to retry for dinner.  The menu here is fairly large and includes a couple of larger family combos and about 10-12 individual combos for one person. I opted to go for Combo #6 (picture uploaded), which included an eggroll, sweet and sour pork, sesame chicken (a dish they're known for) and chicken fried rice. For about $9 including tax I got a large round takeout container filled with the pork, chicken and rice and a bag with the eggroll in it. They included the appropriate condiments and supplied cutlery as well.  First off, the portion sizing is VERY large. For a meal for one person, this easily could have been split and fed two people. I only made a dent in the portion that they gave me. The sesame chicken is pretty damned good here, crispy but saucy and well flavored. The sweet and sour pork was good but wasn't what I was expecting. Battered deep fried pork with an okay sauce on it - not exactly what i was expecting but good enough. The rice was pretty good, I've never been a huge rice person but I ate quite a bit of it. The egg roll was good, not the best I've ever had but I always find that egg rolls are never as good unless they come from my favourite place. Oh, and my fortune cookie was yummy too :)  Secondly, the service was good; this location is generally a pick-up location. I don't think I\"ve ever seen someone eat in and its not a full service restaurant. It would be more of a place that I'd stop off for quick to eat and then leave. The staff were quite busy for a Sunday night but friendly enough. Not much else to say there.  Overall, this is a decent stop for affordable chinese food with great portion sizes. I would definitely try something not deep fried next time, as the combo I had contained a lot of deep fried everything, but it definitely satiated my chinese food craving. My favourite in Pickering is still Paul Wong's, and I find everything there to be a cut above, so I can't help but compare this place to PW. I'll definitely give them another shot since they're conveniently located and the price was right!"}
{"text":"They delivered within specified time. Food is so so, not the best, but ok. Do check your order before the delivery guy leaves. If they make a mistake they refuse to correct it and send you proper item and blame you for ordering wrong. The customer service is horrible. They are rude and will not order from them again!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese food place.  The food is hot and fresh and tastes amazing.  Never disappointed"}
