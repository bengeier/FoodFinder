{"text":"Great service and delicious food. We ordered a bison burger, chicken sandwich, beef burgers, poutine, and chocolate shakes. Everything was made fresh from scratch with very high quality ingredients. The owner and chef has a great attitude and really loves what he does. This is a \"must\" in Calgary! We truly enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"I love coming here when I come out West to visit family. Such a great place! I recommend trying the Bison burger if you are into more gamier foods. They have larger portions for a decent price. My husband likes getting the steak which he always enjoys. Its got a great atmosphere and good to come with groups as well. Service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"You have not truly eaten a burger until you've gone to The Rock. Seriously I cannot recommend this enough it is by far my favorite place in literally ever."}
{"text":"OMG I can't belive I haven't been here before. Best. Burger. In. Calgary. And the owners are SO NICE! Do yourself a favour and go grab yourself one. How can I forget the yam fries? Fresh cut...outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, the service is wonderful and everyone here is awesome.  We even had our work holiday party in December here, they catered everything for us, the food was delicious, there was TONS of it, so no one was hungry, and everyone had a huge variety of food to eat!"}
{"text":"I have just had the best burger in town! Juicy and flavourful. Even better the staff are extremely friendly & the atmosphere was very inviting. If you are looking for a 10 then this is the  place."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. Best burger I've ever had. My partner and I tried the bison and elk burgers, and they were amazing. Super friendly service. We also had there chocolate milkshake which was wonderful! Great yam fries. I can't rave about this place enough! Must try!"}
{"text":"Yes their back. After a long LONG delay the Rock is back and as good or perhaps better than ever. The new location will soon thrust this little gem into the spot light. For those that enjoy finding a special place you can show up and feel like coming home this is it.   The food is fantastic out of this world and still an incredible value.   Try the ribs, or a bowl of corn chowder soup!  Tried the escargot the other night .... NEVER had better EVER!"}
{"text":"The thing about growing up in Toronto, spending a lot of time in Vancouver, and traveling around the world affords you the ability to be exposed to good food. Although the Rock Cafe is new, their quality and longevity isn't new. The Chef and owner Swandri is culinary trained to execute great tasting food. Everything we ate tonight was stunning. Simply orgasmic.   Not only was the main delicious the deserts were just as good. The staff was friendly and weren't afraid to ask how the food and service was. The chef personally thanked you for coming in and asked how the food was.   I assured them I'd be back because there are so many other dishes on the menu we still have to try."}
{"text":"Such an amazing find in Calgary. My boyfriend and I were visiting and were in the mood for some burgers, and did they have some burgers. Being from Chicago, we are very used to the same old beef burger, which are delicious, don't get me wrong. But here, they had Elk, Boar, and Bison!!! We tried out the elk and bison burgers which were freaking amazing. There was Brie cheese on my elk burger, which complimented the meat so perfectly, I couldn't get enough and wolfed that thing down. The people there were very kind, and gave us a dessert of homemade chocolate mousse, which was rich, creamy, and yummy. Super delicious place, you have to check it out."}
{"text":"These guys are so nice and have delicious soup. They didn't advertise much veggie soups but when I asked the waitress, they arranged something for me. Would go again!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we tried The Rock. At first we weren't going to consider going because their website booking system said there were no reservations available but on a hunch (it's a Tuesday), I called to inquire whether they had room for us - they did! So off we went! We parked in the pay lot behind the restaurant and walked in the back door - it was empty ;) It was a hot hot day so the lights weren't on in the restaurant but it added to a cozy atmosphere. We settled on the chicken corn chowder to share as a starter (even though it was 29 degrees outside) and it was flavorful and fresh. The veggies were firm and clearly hadn't been sitting in a soup pot all afternoon. For our mains my husband had the Bison burger with yam wedges - he loved it. The juicy and flavorful burger came on a cheese bun with MOLT (mayo, onion, lettuce & tomato); the best part was the addition of Brie. I had the organic chicken club with regular fries (also wedges). I was truly shocked at how perfectly they cooked the chicken breast: it was flavorful and juicy (my experience is that you need the cheese, bacon and MOLT to give your chicken any nuance of flavor - NOT HERE). My sandwich came with a ciabatta bun that I opted to remove as it detracted from the rest (nothing wrong with the bun but it wasn't essential...I wonder if one could switch to a cheese bun).  All in all we're very glad to have tried The Rock! My sole criticism is that I wish the regular fry wedges had their own signature dipping sauce. Their flavour paled in comparison to the yam fries and their special dip."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest burgers I've had. The owner is a great guy too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I honestly think this is the best food in Calgary! Every time I come here I'm amazed. The staff is extremely friendly as well and it's definitely becoming my new go-to."}
{"text":"What a gem! We booked a large party, and the staff classes ship for our event. Super personable and accommodating staff. Buffet style allowed me to try the bulk of the menu, all of which was mouth wateringly delicious. The bison burger with brie was a great combination of flavors, very juicy for bison. Yam fries crispy with excellent house made aioli. Barbeque babby back ribs fell off the bone. 10/10 would eat again!"}
{"text":"Was not disappointed with its 5 star rating. A friend and I went for the first time. We asked the waitress what she suggested. (Which is always a good idea to do at a new restaurant). She suggested the shrimp burger or the steak special. We ordered both and decided to split them.  The steak and polenta special was so yummy. The steak was tender and tasty. I'd never had polenta before, so good. Presentation was beautiful. The shrimp burger was fantastic. A new spin on an old favourite. Would highly recommend trying out the Rock. It might become a favourite spot."}
{"text":"Diner style, extra friendly staff, .and...yes you can have a boar burger here, with brie. Plus tempura-style yam fries. Which I had, and they were delicious. A must go for the artisanal burger enthusiast. Decent local taps from Wild Rose. A good find, just W of 14 st on N side of 17 av. Boar, not bore!"}
{"text":"Oh my God this place is good. I had a veggie burger which can be meh at the best of places but holy soy that was good! My friend had the beef and I'll take his word for it that it was delicious! And on top of that, the service was just wonderful. Super friendly people who had a great chat with. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"We went to The Rock today and had lunch. They had some interesting choices on their menu. We finally decided on the House Special (ground short rib burger with sauteed onions and blue cheese on a cheese bun.) and fries. The burger was full of flavor and the fries were crisp with a special in house seasoned coating. We spoke with the owner and his wife. They were both very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our meal and time there visiting with them. We will definitely be coming back to The Rock again whenever we are in Calgary. We highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, I had the Wild Boar burger and it was delish. The service was exceptional, our server was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This little gem has been open a block from our house for a while and we kept meaning to go and check it out. We are definitely glad we did and will be back soon!   We started with the escargot as my partner, Dan, has never had them before. I have never had them prepared like this! They were presented in a bowl surrounded by crostini, and it was almost like a stew! There was thick cut bacon and the bowl was very generously filled with escargot, there was definitely no skimping on ingredients.  Dan then had the bison burger which was glazed with BBQ sauce and smothered in double cream Brie. I had the lamb burger which had a Monterey Jack cheese. They were both absolutely mouthwatering, and with every bite we found ourselves loudly muffling \"Mmmmmm\" as we savoured every bite. The fries that came with the burgers were hand cut and appeared to have some kind of very light, crisp tempura style batter that made them delightfully crispy.   Along with the meal we tried their in-house designed cocktails and highly recommend trying them out as they were a perfect compliment to our dinner. After we had finished our meal, the owner treated us to their tiramisu which was, hands down, the best I have ever tried. We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this , I ordered baby back ribs (smoky flavor) & hubby ordered elk burger and yam fries, I ordered the boneless chicken for our kid. Baby back ribs is tender and juicy, can't complain, and I had a bite of hubby's burger, my! I love the juicy and tender meat flavor and I'm guessing their bun is also home made since it felt perfect and sync with it. The yam fries and fries were also great my kid was raving about it too. But, when we had a bite of the chicken, despite its crunchy skin and great seasoning, it didn't mask the old , nearly expired taste of the chicken. I thought it was just one piece so I tried the other one and it's still the same. I decided not to give it to my boy, which is fine since he's full with the fries. We had a great experience but apart from the chicken, which I might never order again next time we visit, thus the 3 stars.."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, great prices and huge portions. He really doesn't skimp out on anything! I'm a heavy eater and I end up stuffed every time! Love it!   If you get the chance, try going for one of this monthly chefs tables, for New Years I think it was 40-50 for a massive entree (Chose a lamb shank), salad, an appetizer, and desert. Both my date and me were stuffed and we both took home a full meal for the next day."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem tbh the owner alone is such a genuine high spirited person. He greeted us and had a pretty good chat . The foood is literally amazing my mouth is watering just smelling it. Bison burger & fries are a must try."}
{"text":"Excellent food at super reasonable prices.  Everything on the menu is under $15.  The bison burger with brie is always an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Came back here tonight excited about the possibility of having the creme brûlée. Unfortunately u came to learn that they have completely changed the theme of the place and changed some of the items on the menu.  What really appealed to me about this place was that the food was so good and also the price was reasonable. Today it was a little disappointing that the price had gone up a bit and the quantity of the meal is less. For example if you ordered a burger it came with fries or a side salad. Now for the same price you only get the burger and the sides are a separate order.  However they haven't lost the quality of their food. Still top notch to me. The meal also came with a sample of fried chicken. Which was very crispy and tender on the inside.  I understand that the economy are hitting the small businesses hard however this is a very competitive time. I sure hope that this place stay afloat because the food here is fantastic."}
{"text":"YUMMM!!!!!  All I can say is .....YUMMM!!! But since yelp won't let me leave it at that...My husband got the bison burger.  He said it was delicious, that the meat was tender, super flavorful, and the bread was perfect.  I got the veggie burger which usually sucks at other places...but not here.  They make their own veggie patties with ground up vegetables and bread crumbs.  It tasted way better than prepackaged patties that most burger joints have.  My husband and I also shared puntine which was AMAZING too.  We did add salt to it but that's because we REALLY like our salt, probably a little too much ;).  Most people probably won't end up.needing to put salt on it. And last but not least, the service was incredible.  The owners were super friendly and went out of their way to serve us.  We will eat there everytime we come to Calgary."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck! Simple menu but everything on there is delicious - this place definitely deserves the 5 stars it has earned. Burgers are a really nice size, juicy and flavorful! Our table had the beef, elk, bison and boar burgers. None of them disappointed! Try the corn chowder too. Honestly one of the best corn chowders I've ever had. The chef was on Chef's Table so he is a professional chef and super friendly. Not only is the food 5 star but the service is 5 star too. Spoke with the chef and this place used to be a fine dining restaurant which he converted to a burger place. Everything is freshly made! Love this find - a gem!"}
{"text":"So been to The Rock twice now, and will tell about both times. Alternatively don't even waste time reading this review just go get yourself a ridiculously tasty burger.   First time went in at the end of Nov 2016 with 2 work colleagues and my mom who was visiting from overseas, Had seen great reviews and its not everywhere you can find wild game burgers on offer every day.  Mom and I shared the boar and brie burger, which was juicy, flavourful, with just the right amount of brie so that you can taste it with every bite. All their burgers come on a cheese bun which tastes incredibly fresh. We paired our meal with their poutine of the day which was Elk Bacon Poutine with a red wine creamy gravy - of man! What a delicious bile of cheesy saucy potato goodness! Portion was massive too. Even with sharing a burger we couldn't finish it and the other 2 ladies with us had to help out.  The other lady with us had the shrimp burger which was a delightful surprise. They finally chop the shrimp and press it together with rice flour I think, to make it all stick together. Still has all the great shrimp flavour. My other coworker went with the boar brie burger too and loved every bite.  All agreed we will need to bring the rest of the office back for some tasty burgers. Plus they have wild rose on tap - whats not to love?   Second time we went was last week to pick up burgers for dinner. The owner remembered me! Even remembered that I had come in with other people and someone was visiting. Had a nice chat while my burgers were getting ready. This time we got the elk brie burger and the bison brie burger - each had a half and couldn't decide which one we liked more. Also as it was January they had a special on that all their burgers came with free fries.  I am not the biggest fan of burgers so they really need to be good for me to rate them highly. The Rock has ruined all other burgers for me. Take everyone you know and go and eat there!  Also check out their facebook page as that is where they have their monthly specials, as well as details on special dinners they do which look unreal and I cant wait to try.   Amazing value for money + supporting a small local business at the same time = winning at food!"}
{"text":"SOOO delicious!!!! This place is amazing. I love the chef, he is so passionate about his food! Where else does the chef come to your table & gleefully describe their Special of the Day?? Great food, great service. A++++"}
{"text":"A burger that is ground in house and cooked your way - heck yes! Casual atmosphere, affordable prices for quality ingredients not to mention the burgers are served on a cheese bun! Woah nelly! Please support this gem!   I am not sure if what I had was on the menu, they said it was their beef with brie but the menu says with cheddar ... but who cares it was a delight. The bun was great, the meat was outstanding, and the toppings were stellar. The toppings are served on the side so you add what you want.   I asked for a pickle and also got the poutine, while my friend stuck with standard  fries. I loved that the fries are not very greasy - no stomach aches here! The poutine is very mushroom-y so just a heads up about that (I know quite a few mushroom haters).   Some might complain that was that it was a messy meal... but not this kid. I practically licked my plate (or paper on a tray in this case)."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Usually get the Brie short rib burger. One of the few places in town that grind their own meat so you can get burgers and a medium rare."}
{"text":"Delicious food, outstanding service. Shared 8-10 things on the menu with friends, didn't dislike anything. Had all the different types of burgers and each of them was unique and tasty. I thought the BBQ sauce was just a bit heavy and hid the taste of the meat a bit. Everything is custom made, for example, they don't use frozen fries or chicken strips. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great fall-off-the-bone pork ribs. The burgers are big enough to satisfy a large appetite."}
{"text":"The Rock is owned and run by an affable Indonesian husband and wife: what is really cool is that their personalities shine through in their creations, and in their contest prizes. These burgers, specials and sides are innovative and almost slurpy good! My wife and I have tried different burger meats, ribs, fries and sides several times, and always leave feeling full and satisfied. Quite simply, count on everything being super tasty, fairly nutritious, and filling. The sweet potato french fries are always worth a go, as are the elk, bison, lamb, and high-end beef burgers.  The only downsides? The attractive-looking burger buns fall apart too much and leave your fingers smeared with sauces and cheese. Although eating with knife and fork might work, the burgers are too large for this to work well. Unless that is their aim and they've won over many 'sticky finger' fans, might we request a bun that doesn't so easily get punished into drippy pulp? The interior to The Rock is long and lean, meaning that it's not all that homey looking, and to some, likely unappealing for eat-in. Our kind and outgoing host mentioned they will relocate to a better venue in 2018 when that whole block will be razed for another purpose.  Lots of parking in the back means that there's no need to park on the street, but we still have to keep the meter in mind. When we met another foodie couple from Cochrane (a really good-eating town!), they avidly said that they always stop in at The Rock when in the big city. Why? The host and his food.  Check this provincial and national burger championship winner out, and see if you don't agree?  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Don't usually do reviews, BUT... this place is amazing! Hands down the best burger and fries I have had in forever! I had the short rib burger with Brie ... all I can say is make sure you have lots of napkins, so juicy and so delicious! We are in town for 2 days and I think we will go back tomorrow. The chef and is wife a so friendly and it obvious they are so proud of what they do."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is amazing... The cook and his wife? Are adorable! They're so passionate about the burgers it's simple the best experience you're gonna get having a burger. No pretention (yup making up words it's so good!). The burger is by far the best in Calgary. And there's so many burgers to try. But the house ground burger medium.... Oh my God! My stomach rumbles thinking about it, and I just ate!! The ribs are excellent too. Fall of the bone with a sauce that's just tangy enough without being too sweet.  The fried chicken and fries seem to be almost tempura coated. It's delicious and very different then other places.  I've gone here multiple times in a week and not been disappointed once."}
{"text":"We had our first meal at the Rock during our first trip to Canada, and we couldn't stop talking about it thru out the whole trip.  We tried 4 kinds of burgers and they were all delicious.  Plus, the poutine was out of this world.  On top of that, the owner was very nice and outgoing. We had a great conversation with him. My younger son said he should move to Bay Area so that we could enjoy his food more often, and the owner said many customers from the states had told him the same thing!  His concern was he wouldn't be able to find good meat suppliers for his burgers outside of Alberta.  Hopefully, we will go back soon."}
{"text":"Had the lamb burger and bbq burger and it was really great. The place kind of looks like a hole in a wall and you have probably driven/walked past it a bajillion times and not even noticed it. It's kind of a shame because you can tell the owner really likes what he does and the food is great. He even noticed that we were a first time visitor and treated us to a mini dessert platter. The dine-in experience was very personal which was nice.   I would recommend this place if you are looking for a good burger as I haven't tried anything else on the menu. But most definitely the lamb burger!   I wish they were in a better location and/or had a much more appealing sign because it's easy to miss."}
{"text":"I ordered the Boar Burger and my brother ordered the bird. It was very tasty and service  was outstanding."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie! Went here tonight with two girlfriends and everything was outstanding. Friend got tomato soup before her meal - have NEVER tasted tomato soup so good. All 3 of us couldn't believe it. She wanted to order another bowl with her meal! Plus the presentation was even beautiful - like the way they make designs in lattes...  I had the Lamb Burger, friends had Veal dinner & the Bison Burger. All great. The house salad dressing was also - A. MAZING. Tasted like maple vinaigrette? Atmosphere was lovely - small, quaint, quiet, intimate. And service attentive without being overbearing. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We live 1200 miles away from here. The few times a year we are in Calgary, we have to stop by for the best burger we've ever had (besides my husbands, of course!). Melt in your mouth deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"They have simplified their menu, and offer specialty burgers and baby back ribs. January special is complementary hand cut french fries along with your meal order. The menu is expanded on weekends, offering some fancier fare."}
{"text":"The Rock Café & Restaurant is another gem nestled on 17th Ave. It specializes in Asian French fusion cuisine but you'd be hard pressed to guess that from the outside. Well, be prepared to be surprised because this place knows what's up.  We came as a group of 8 to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was absolutely pouring buckets when arrived. We had to circle around the block a few times to grab a parking spot but if we were smart, we would have just parked behind the restaurant where it's free. The place was absolutely packed as it was a Friday night but luckily, the bday girl was smart and reserved ahead of time. The inside is tight and narrow with one long hallway lined with booths. It is just a wee bit cramped but the cool thing is that the kitchen is smack dab in the middle of the restaurant meaning you can see everything that goes on!  - Tempura calamari ($9.95) and quinoa salad ($8.95 large) - crispy calamari breaded in tempura flour and served with The Rock tarter sauce. The calamari was nicely seasoned, tender and crispy. The aioli sauce it came with was perfect for dipping. The quinoa salad was fresh and a healthy option you don't see too often at these type of restaurants. - Salad - the salad was pretty basic but they did top it off with a handful of grated cheese. Pretty standard salad starter. - Beef soup - my friend O wasn't a fan which meant I was left to eat it. The soup wasn't very flavourful itself but it had a couple of pieces of meat that were passable. Next time we'll make sure to ask what the soup of the day is before ordering it as one of the sides. Skip it.  - Rocking lamb shank ($25.95) - jumbo lamb shank braised with rosemary demi jus. You get to choose two sides so we went with mashed potatoes and salad. I'm not sure why The Rock has an obsession with adding these potato skin garnishes on top of their entrees but I wasn't a fan. That's just a little nitpicking. The lamb shank was hugeeeeeeeee. They aren't kidding in the description when they call it jumbo. Tender, fall off the bone and with mashed potatoes, you'll be in carb/meat heaven. Really rich, hearty flavours. - Muscovy duck breast ($25.95) - roasted 10 oz duck breast served with sautéed spinach and mushroom in an orange brandy sauce. We picked the other two side options which were French fries and a beef soup. The beef soup was pretty bland, nothing special but forget about that, let's talk about the duck breast! Holy duck, it was perfectly cooked medium rare. Succulent, tasty and a very generous portion for the price. This is easily more than $30+ at other restaurants. The sautéed spinach was a nice contrast to the duck and gave us some much needed greens. - Wild mushroom and cheese ravioli ($14.99) and burgers - the rest of our group ordered burgers and one tried out the ravioli. They have a pretty diverse selection of burgers to choose from - lamb, bison and wild shrimp burgers were pretty tempting.  - Tiramisu - the staff were super sweet and gave the birthday girl a free dessert. This is one of the desserts people keep raving about and it hits the spot! Creamy, a little boozy and the perfect way to end our meal.  The Rock Café is a small but cool little spot to get some delicious entrees without paying fine dining prices for them. Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers in Calgary - all of their ingredients are fresh and top quality.  The chef is a master. Do yourself a favor and eat here! It is an odd location but there is parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went back to the rock with the family tonight. Elk and bison burgers. We shared dry ribs which were moist and very nicely flavoured followed by boneless chicken. Hubby loved the spice and tenderness of the chicken but I'm going again for ribs n fries!!!  Burger and yam fries with red wine gravy ohhh yessss  this place is fantastic! I had an elk burger and my friend had a bison burger.   Everything is made fresh so it's not fast food. The high quality ingredients really shine through and the service was amazing. I was so hungry that I forgot to take pics, so sorry fellow Yelpers!   Please try this place as the entrance is very unassuming.  The man at the counter advised they have a monthly chefs tasting that features a different ingredient used in various styles. That sounds like a great girls night out to me!  I will definitely return here to try more items. As for the red wine gravy, I could have drank it straight from a shot glass!!!"}
{"text":"Omg- this place has awesome food! Don't be fooled by the outside. They have fabulous burgers. I had the elk Brie burger, my husband isn't a Brie fan- so they put cheddar on his. We had the Poutine as a side and it was fabulous too. They also gave us a complimentary dessert of chocolate mousse and it was all home- made and wonderful. This will bring us back to Calgary!"}
{"text":"The best burger in calgary. Everything made in house from scratch and with the love and care you'd expect from a high end restaurant. If you're craving a burger or fried chicken do your self the favour and check this place out."}
{"text":"So glad to see the Rock settled into their new location on 17th. I've always been a big fan of their shrimp and lamb burgers. My daughter tried the Muscovy chicken breast and my wife and I had the rack of lamb. Unbelievable! Best I've tried anywhere! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to the rock three times now; I've ordered a different burger each time. While the joint itself is rather small, theres nothing small about the burgers .  Elk, bison, beef, chicken, pork... you name it. They're all good and imaginative.   In the rare case that you're not feeling the itch to chomp on a tasty burger, there are other options to please your palate as well.   In an age where there's hundreds of burger joints, do yourself a favor a check this one out so you can better weed out the fluff from the good stuff."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood restaurant located in the 17th Ave area in Calgary.  Came here solely based on the solid Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  Service was great on a quiet Tuesday night. Ordered the dumplings to start, veal steak with a side of mashed potatoes and a tiramisu to finish the meal. The portions are HUGE, if you are sharing a meal with someone I would recommend only getting one appetizer and one main so you have room for dessert. The menu is simple and clear, lots of innovative burgers/sandwiches, a few seafood pastas and some notable mains such as the veal, lamb shank and duck breast.  Definitely French Asian fusion type of cuisine, a nice restaurant for a reasonable price - 1 appetizer, 2 mains and 1 dessert for under $70, a rare find in Calgary that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Bison burgers are delicious here! Service is amazing and the restaurant had a great vibe to it."}
{"text":"Meat on burgers is so thin you can't even tell the difference between the boar and the venison. They told us the poutine was big enough for two people. It is not! Weird concept. We expected a pub like atmosphere but instead it's an Asian fast food burger joint where you pay up front, sit in plastic chairs and need a key to use the bathroom. Food tastes really good, but value based on price is off. Probably because there is no one else in the restaurant, you end up paying a premium for them to stay open just to serve you."}
{"text":"A great place for burgers their patties are flavorful and moist the topping selection is great and lots of variety to choose from. The Rock has lots of game meats like elk and moose. For more flavor try the elk.  The staff here is friendly and very helpful.  One thing I'd like to comment on is the choice of buns it seems to be a cheese bun but a little too soft for my liking as it started to crumble in my hand. For such a hefty Patty it would be nice to see a bun that can support the weight. Perhaps next time I'll ask them to toast a bun which might make a difference other than that everything about our experience was perfect."}
{"text":"First time here and a delicious bison brie burger found its way into my belly!  Very casual joint where you order at the front. Wild rose on tap and a variety of burgers to choose from. They have a couple other items on the menu but not much, as well as some sides you can order. They also hold a monthly chef's table if you enjoy trying cuisine that uses interesting ingredients and it's also paired with wine!  I had the bison brie burger while my husband had the boar brie burger. I was planning on trying a bite of his but ended up so immersed in my own burger that I totally forgot! The patty was juicy and flavourful, and there was a perfect amount to of brie to complement. It had a good amount of greenery and tomato, decent amount of sautéed mushroom that I added on, and had a fabulous cheese bun that was nice and airy! I personally find most burgers have too much bread in the bread to meat ratio.... again my own personal opinion, but this was perfect!   The service was great and they're super friendly! I got some restaurant and foodie tips from them as well! I will definitely be back when I'm craving a delicious juicy burger.... definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This is still my favorite place in Calgary. I don't know what they did to that side salad but it's like crack. I want more... I've got the shakes for it. The staff is so friendly. This is some outstanding food.  The baby back ribs are to die for and my friends had the penne pasta and it was so flavorful. LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing food and the owner is the nicest!! Would definitely return for the tasty food but mostly the service!"}
{"text":"Good eats... The rest are just Words to fill review because i have nothing else to say and stupid Yelp makes you write more.. How annoying"}
