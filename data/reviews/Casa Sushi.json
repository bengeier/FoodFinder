{"text":"HEARTBROKEN!
I've been to Casa Sushi two times: my first time was a week ago and my last time was 2 days ago..
the first time I went here, I fell in love with the place. The food was delish (i ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box & the dynamite rolls), the service was very good and the atmosphere couldn't have been better..
plus it was inexpensive...I COULDN'T WAIT TO GO BACK...

2 days ago, i ordered the same exact thing. I ate everything and was almost done with my rice, when I spotted something ...
CRAWLING IN MY RICE!!!!!!IT WAS A TINY LITTLE WORM!!!!!!!

 I showed my friend, and we were about the vommit. We showed the waiter and a few minutes later, I think it was either the manager or the owner came. She apologized and asked if I was okay. She told me she didn't know how the worm got on my plate. She said I wouldn't have to pay for my bento box and offered to make me a new one. 

At that point, I didn't have an appetite, so I said no. My friend didn't end up eating the rest of her bento box. 

I was really dissapointed. I really loved this place. Casa Sushi was going to be my new sushi joint, but not anymore.. 


Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"This place is great.
My boyfriend and I had a sushi go-to place in Roncey but sadly shut down. However, we were so happy to find this nice little nook. 
Really cool fusion/experimental rolls! (re: mango/banana roll).
The one server there is ridiculously nice and very hard-working. We were sitting outside and our table was not big enough for the sushi plates we were getting so we offered to just move inside and bring our stuff but she took our plates and merged them together without even damaging one roll!  Small things do count. :)
Sushi is great, service is great - oh and don't forget the complimentary Green Tea/Mango/Red Bean mango when your done your meal! 
Thank you Casa!"}
{"text":"Service: Good, very nice people

Drink: Hot tea is very hot, be careful

Price: $10 average - very reasonable compared to other sushi shops

My favorite is the Beauty and the Beast roll and another favorite of ours is Snow White roll. 

Their lunch prices are great value 

Recommended: YES, this is our favorite spot for sushi. We have to drive there for 15 min but it is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for a romantic supper.  Food was excellent, the atmosphere was very nice and the service was decent.  Would have been five stars but was not immaculate in terms of cleanliness and the waiter did not seem to know the menu very well.  Very polite and good food though, can't beat the price for great sushi."}
{"text":"When I first moved from Queen and John to the east end I struggled to find a decent/cheap sushi place to replace Sushi Queen.  Well I have had success with Casa Sushi.  You get huge portions for a low price and the delivery is very reliable.  The sushi/sashimi combinations are the best.  Lot's of sushi plus salad and miso soup.  You also get a free California roll if you get delivery or 15% off if you eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Free edamame, free dessert, and all of the food that came in between was fantastic.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place!  My daughter and I happened on this place and really enjoyed it.  We had the avocado/cucumber roll and scorpion roll.  We also thought the miso soup and edamame were great.  Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This one is like all other japanese restaurants of the same price range. nothing special. mediocre"}
{"text":"Great inexpensive Japanese restaurant.

We have eaten at the restaurant a couple of times, but we mostly have dinner delivered to our place.  It is usually delivered within the hour.

Makis and sushis are fresh and tasty.  Their hot dishes, such as oyako don and chicken curry, are very tasty.

Highly recommend for evenings when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant. Their rolls are delicious and full of taste. Prices are fair and service is great. They also deliver which is a bonus. Favorite is their fire house roll."}
{"text":"Good - reliable - inexpensive.  Fried udon with chicken is actually really good!  My son won't eat it from anywhere else.  And they make a simple inari (fried tofu) maki roll which most places don't have... great for small kids who don't like raw fish.  Both dine in and take out are good.  It's our goto sushi place."}
{"text":"The prices aren't as good as Sushi Delight, but I always choose this place because their tables are larger and i like the atmosphere.  The service is always friendly and never rush you.  Their BBQ ribs lunch bento is such a bargain and it taste SOOOOO DAMN GOOOOOOOD!!!!! Great marbling on  the ribs .  That's all I order and I cant get enough. I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Looking for a sit-in alternative to Sushi Marche, the SO and I trekked North to Danforth to select a sushi place for dinner. Katsu was not an option do to the cockroach incident (see review http://www.yelp.ca/biz/katsu-japanese-restaurant-toronto#hrid:2V9eB8QO_EM2QBDC6ql1MQ ) And Sushi Delight was really busy. We picked Casa Sushi and went inside.

We were famished and ordered a ridiculous amount of food. Edamame comes free on the house. We also sampled a vegetarian bento which was alright at $8.00. It has a deep friend vegetable patty that resembled a nature burger which was gross, but otherwise. The SO had a Katsu-Don. Was ok, but he grumbled about how it was prepared incorrectly. Regardless it was eaten. Additionally, we ordered a selection of rolls. Their spicy tuna contained avocado which I didn't like. The hamachi was ok, the fish portion being very tiny. The spider and dynamite rolls were average. 
 
The service was good, and the decor very modern, made for a comfortable experience. Ice cream at the end was on the house and the tea was steaming hot. Full liquor menu if you are looking for that kind of thing. Bill was $45 for a Bento, a Meal and 4 rolls. No issue packing the rest to go. 

Its cheap and close, but quality is on par with the cheap Annex places. I prefer Big Sushi better, but for a quick fix its ok."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for lunch there. We went to Sushi Delight once and the service was horrible! We tried to compare Casa toward Delight. The service was awesome and I loved it. The food was great too! I'd totally go there again! The food was fresh and the place wasn't very busy. It's a great place when you are very time limited. I think it's a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wooo... This is a tasteful sushi restaurant in Toronto. It Just locat in Greektown and close by chester subway station. The place is very clean and the service is very nice. I order Enoki Beef Roll for appetizer and it come very fast and delicious. My friends love the specialty rolls which is Beauty and the Best and Snow White. Also the Seafood  Noodle is very yummy too... We have a wonderful dinner there and we will come back with our family and friend. Also the price $$$$ is very reasonable ...  They priovide the free delivery service with the order over $20.00"}
{"text":"Incredible sushi value on the Danforth.

The vegetarian bento box comes with a cucumber roll, miso soup, salad, veg tempura, tofu, rice and a dumpling for under $8.00! I rarely finish it, but it's such a great value I can't help but order it!

 If you eat in at the restaurant you also get complimentary edamame and ice cream dessert. All of the sushi is equally reasonably priced.

So cheap and so tasty. It's an added bonus that the staff are welcoming and friendly, and the decor quite nice!"}
{"text":"I love their salmon don... Always fresh and delicious sushi... Great and prompt service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Beef tataki here is SO GOOD. I come to Casa JUST for the beef tataki. 

People are nice. You get complimentary edamame, which I enjoy thoroughly. Their lunch specials are inexpensive. I really like their chicken cutlet. However, I did not enjoy the beef don. It was sliced too thick. Sushi is not great though. But the beef tataki is the bomb."}
{"text":"the quality of my chirachi was good, wiht fresh fish but it's is the smallest plate of chirachi i have ever had..."}
{"text":"As a non-sushi fan (the irony, I know), I really enjoyed my lunch at Casa Sushi. Great decor inside (sleek and clean), really friendly staff (didn't laugh when I asked for a knife and fork) and super cheap lunch specials. For only $6.99, I had chicken teriyaki, tempura, dumplings, salad, miso soup and rice. Call me a novice, but that seems like an excellent deal! 
My lovely boss who introduced me to Casa Sushi thoroughly enjoyed her ocean roll AND my dumplings. And the complementary green tea was a warming touch on a cold winter day. 
SUPER CHEAP,and quite tasty. Wish I liked sushi so I could have given a more 'robust' Yelp report!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. But the fact it took them forever to bring my food and also to took forever to pay my bill."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the place is great for a quick lunch or dinner.  The decor is pretty generic looking and the service isn't the greatest,  but they do give you free soy beans and ice cream during your meal!

The lunch specials are pretty cheap and the quantity of food you get will definitely fill you up.  I usually get a bento box and they come with a soup and salad.  The sushi isn't the best in Toronto,  in fact it probably isn't even top 20, but it does the job.

Stop by if you're looking for cheap sushi in the area.  The fact they have cans of Asahi is also a plus!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Casa Sushi but it's not for a lack of this place beeing really damn good. I guess I've just been seduced by the siren song of AYCE sushi and this place doesn't have that option.

That being said, Casa produces some superior quality food! Of particular note is that their Beef Tataki is the best I've had in this city and some of their other unique and unusual dishes are also very very good. Speaking of which, how often do you see a Sushi place that innovates? :P

Honestly, this place is great and I have no idea by which standard some of the poor reviews are writing from because you'd be hard-pressed to find a better Sushi place without going to a fine dining super expensive place."}
{"text":"Visited March 9 for dinner. 
If you're looking good sushi along the Danforth, Casa Sushi is the place to go! Service was friendly and attentive, will definitely be coming back!

Pros
Shrimp and veggie tempura was crisp and flavourful. 
Red Dragon Roll fresh and satisfying.
Their signature Casa roll at $10.50 is a bit steep. 

Cons
Washroom downstairs a bit hard to get to. 
No brown rice available for rolls/sushi, can't be a five star sushi place unless you have brown rice available. 
Parking is a bit tough in this area Green P parking is easier than trying to parallel park on the Danforth. 

Protip - For dessert they sometimes offer free icecream, instead of choosing just one flavour I asked for all three and they gave me a small scoop of each lol!

Damage $35 after tax before tip."}
{"text":"Delicious! Glad I found a sushi place I like and that has a bit of vegetarian variety outside the more traditional options."}
{"text":"Nice dining room with decent service and a moderately priced menu, but the sashimi platter I had there one recent afternoon was in my opinion near its overdue date, and the spicy salmon roll was rather ordinary and with very little heat. Maybe the regular chef was absent or off his game, but first impression is critical when it comes to tasting sushi."}
{"text":"Living in the neighbourhood and sushi being my favourite food I've definitely been to all the Japanese restaurants on the Danforth. Casa is my 2nd favourite. First is Aji Sai (not affiliated with the Aji Sai at Queen and Spadina) east of Pape almost to Jones. The service is mediocre but the food is consistent. I'd come here more if the service improved, mostly the staff just aren't as friendly and often awkward. I can only assume they couldn't care less about their performance.

 My favourite dish here is the kani salad. It doesn't sound that special. Shredded crab with lettuce, cucumber, tomato, tobiko, Japanese mayo and their house salad dressing all come together to become a comfort dish for me. Those ingrediants just please my taste buds and I'll come back for more on the next craving."}
{"text":"here's the way to ruin an otherwise good experience.

i chose casa sushi to cater my kid's birthday party. i ordered 4 different sushi 'boats'. plastic trays. the food was all fine. quite good in fact.

the problem came much later when while we were cleaning up from the party my wife told me how the delivery driver literally attempted to extort his tip.

the bill was just shy of $190. he refused to give change for the $200 my wife presented to him. first he didn't understand the language. then he stood fast arguing that she couldn't possibly want change. she had to demand the change. she was appalled by the driver's behavior.

sorry driving 4 blocks from your place of business and making one trip into a house at 4:30 in the afternoon does not qualify for an $11 tip. that kind of attitude qualifies for zero and had i been home that's what would have happened though my wife is far too easy and still gave the driver a substantial tip.

follow up: repeated attempts to speak to management are met with immature antics over the telephone."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Just a warning this is an odd review.

My bf and I came in for dinner and were having a lovely time when at the table next to us a little girl got very sick to her stomach. A few times. Right beside us.

Needless to say our appetite was ruined. It was no ones fault and I do believe it was not the issue of the restaurant, the girls parents were overheard saying she was just getting over the flu. Parents : PLEASE don't drag your kids out if they are ill, if at all avoidable.

We did not want to continue our meal and the staff were very gracious about the ordeal, only charging us for the sake we drank and not the soup/salad we consumed before the unexpected event.

Thank you for being awesome Casa Sushi, we will be back to try your food, we promise!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the place but I've ordered delivery a few times and everytime the food and value was good. We usually order beef/salmon bentos and add some rolls. the bentos come with tempura, california roll, fried dumplings and the usual rice/salad/soup. Foods good, value is good, haven't gotten sick from here yet so that's a win in my books"}
{"text":"Got delivery from here and it's decent food.  The fish didn't seem so fresh and on the warm side. Not much more to say."}
{"text":"Sushis are really good and Delivery time is correct. We always have what we ordered in good condition. We ordered different kind of sushis and rolls and everything was good! 
Should add complimentary edamame..."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

I've been here a few times now.  The decor is lovely, and I like the little patio.  The portion sizes are fair, and the quality of sushi is ok.  Is it the best ever?  Not so much, but you can do a lot worse.

I wish there were a 3.5 star rating to choose.  
We had a sushi/sashimi combo that was good value - at $12.95...."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite, affordable sushi restaurant in Toronto a few days ago. Just walking around Greektown looking for something to eat, I noticed the lunch menu at Casa Sushi and went inside. A nice clean place, and great service. To my pleasant surprise, I was served miso soup and a salad before my meal arrived. And once my sushi was brought to me, it was nice to see that they use avocado in the sushi. A lot of restaurants avoid avocado because it's \"expensive\", but I love avocado in my spicey tuna/salmon. I look forward to visiting Casa Sushi again next year when I visit my friends while in town for TIFF."}
{"text":"The spicy salmon lunch sushi special was just a bit off....The fish had a more greyish hue than pinkish hue.  My friend said it was fresh. So we started eating. We had a long and fun catching up session and coincidentally, neither one of us finished the dish.

It was practically empty on a warm, late summer day. I think we stayed for more than 2 hours without feeling the rush to leave."}
{"text":"Perfectly decent sushi, but for me they lose a star because they don't provide the option of brown rice sushi. Lots of the better sushi places are offering that now, so for me there are better choices. No reason not to eat healthy when I eat out.

Now Sushi Friends on the Danforth offers brown rice, so I go there instead. I wish Casa Sushi would too, because I prefer their rolls."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 
Pretty extensive menu.
Salad with dressing is yummy. It has a kick, but very tasty. Reminded me of a spicy ponzu sauce.
Beauty and the beast roll was really good.
Sashimi and sushi combo was ok (item 709) Small sashimi pieces, but spicy salmon roll was delicious. Nice and big. Didn't like the sushi selection.
Red dragon roll was ok. Not as good as spicy salmon and beauty and beast roll. 
Server brought water but you have to ask for green tea (free)
Free ice cream - selection: green tea, red bean, or mango"}
{"text":"I USE TO LOVE THIS PLACE.

NOT AFTER TONIGHT.

I order tonight for car takeout, it no go so well.
They tell me 20 minutes, it take 60.

They put hot meat sushi next to cold veggie roll, it cause steam that make veg sushi NASTY. it sit for 20 minute while i wait for tempura. I am vegetarian, wasabi and ginger coated in fish, my roll taste like meat. 

They yell at me to \"SIT DOWN\" when i wait for takeout, looking at our rolls.

Worst car picnic with boyfriend ever have. We order $30 of food - only provide one set of chopsticks, TINY container of soy sauce. Sushi rolls were steam for 20 minutes, taste disgusting. 

Do no go here."}
{"text":"Dined here for dinner on Wednesday night for a friend's birthday and they were not busy.  My friends and I requested to sit in the front patio and the server allowed us.  Since we needed a table for five, we had to move the chairs and tables around so that we could all fit.  Because of the shifting of the furnitures, I guess the server forgot we needed water, utensils and napkin.  As a result, I was given appetizers that came with my meal (miso soup and salad that came with my pan fried udon with chicken and vegetables) without utensils.  It took us a couple of minutes to grab the server's attention before she realize we needed them.  I know some Japanese restaurants immediately serve you miso soup while looking at the menu, however, this restaurant only serves miso soup to those that comes with their meal.  I love the salad dressing that came with my salad.  The pan fried udon with chicken and vegetables tasted mediocre.  The vegetable consisted of carrot, onion and zucchini.  There was adequate amount of udon and actually a lot of chicken.  Lastly, they gave us ice cream on the house for dinner (with flavours of green tea, red bean or mango). 

I usually dine here for their lunch special when I'm craving for sushi pieces or udon.  Their service is usually much better on lunch and more bang for your bucks.  I usually opt for the California roll and Spicy Salmon roll which is a total of sixteen pieces for $6.95 (when comparing it to their neighbour Sushi Delight who offers a total of twelve pieces of California rolls and Alaska rolls for $7.95).  They both come with soup and salad. 

Another item I usually get for lunch is their lunch special of chicken katsu udon with four pieces of California roll.  You can ask for their udon spicy powder (which comes in a bottle on the) to add more flavour to the soup base. 

Overall, I would rate their lunch 4/5 and dinner 3/5."}
{"text":"We order from here quite a bit.  Their noodles could be better - at least they offer a gluten free noodle.  The sushi is good, never had a problem.  The deep fried squid I would pass on, as would I pass on the noodle soup and the curry chicken."}
{"text":"I recently try this Casa Sushi I was not too happy the service.  They did not bring the ginger and the hot green stuff, and I order a chicken teriyaki that comes with salad and soup.  The food was not enough they suppose to add extra rice and chicken if you I'm paid more for the price.  What a worse experience  I ever had."}
{"text":"The best value! 

Casa Sushi's a typical Chinese Japanese restaurant with the typical Chinese Japanese sushi menu. But the value is unbreakable in town! The quality's standard as you can expect at any of the unauthentic sushi places. But it gives out free edamame appetizer and ice cream (green tea, mango, red beans) on the house! And a fantastic sushi boat (more than enough for 2 ppl) is only $30! Plus 15% off discount for frequent guests. 

My boyfriend and I love to go there for a budgeted and healthy dinner. With $35, 2 ppl walk out of the Casa Sushi with much satisfaction without feeling guilty of consuming too much fat. 

Waiting staff are nice and friendly. They've regconized us only after 1 or 2 visits. We're too spoiled there that now we wouldn't spend extra on regular/standard sushi places."}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighbourhood for five years so I have tried the other sushi places in the area. This has definitely become my go-to sushi place. I have taken family here a few times now and they have also enjoyed it. Everything I have had as tasted good and fresh and the wait staff is always pleasant and friendly but, also leave you in peace to enjoy your meal. You get free edamame and ice cream with dinner so, what's not to like about that!!"}
{"text":"I really really like casa sushi, it's my favorite sushi restaurant near me:) The teriyaki chicken and dynamite rolls are very yummy, there rice used for the sushi is looser than other places but I like it looser anyways! Japanese croquettes are very yummy and no matter which sushi restaurant I go to they are still very yummy, casa sushi none the less also has very yummy croquettes! Yum yum croquettes:)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. The service was fast and I got my rolls in about 10 minutes. They were quite big but filled with filling rather than cheaply padded with rice.  I also got ice cream on the house which comes in either red bean, green tea and mango. The servers were nice and fast without being in your face.
As someone who works at a sushi restaurant as a waitress, I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"The food was decent and the prices were also decent. As far as variety, it has a lot to offer. It won't overwhelm you, but can surely get the job done."}
{"text":"Great place to just hop in for casual lunch . Always on the Danforth and this place has become a staple visit at least once a week. The wait staff can be a bit friendlier given the amount of times I come in but I am am here for the special and not their company. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff are rude. Their online menu contradicts their in-store menu, and when I tried to order the staff member refused to give me the deals online and also denied their website's prices. They would benefit from clearing up their pricing scheme online, not having 3 different menus, and refusing to give customers the deals they advertise"}
