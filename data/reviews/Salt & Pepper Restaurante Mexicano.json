{"text":"Whether you enjoy your Salt & Pepper experience will depend on your approach to Mexican food. If you prefer dishes like Tacos, Hot-iron chicken fajitas, or Enchiladas, S & P will deliver (it's hard to miss on these sorts of dishes), albeit at an inflated price.   It's worth the cost if you favor more traditional fare, such as their (cheap) Azteca soup, a fresh and hearty tomato-chipotle base married with chicken and avocado. Combine it with their in-house chips and salsa/guacamole and you may not need an entree. Their Mole is also splendid, the staple sauce starting out chocolatey sweet and slowly filling the mouth with a comfortable warmth. As is typical in these smaller Mexican restaurants, the amount of meat on the plate is low but the flavors are solid and mostly worth the price."}
{"text":"We had such an awful experience with service here that we vowed never to return!  Note: we used to frequent this restaurant and it was a  good place for lunch-- the food was good, lovely Inglewood atmosphere etc-- but when we had children we quickly realized this was NOT the place to go anymore.  They would not allow us to sit outside with the children- so we were forced to sit inside on a gorgeous summer day.  That wouldnt have been such an issue except we were treated so rudely we really had no option but to never support them again.  Keep in mind we are usually very forgiving!   So i wouldnt pass this place by based on my one review- but I wouldnt recommed if you have children.  Would be interested to see if anyone else had the same bad experience- or perhaps that particular waitress was having a bad day- or is long gone by now."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Arrived at 6:30 on Wednesday and seated right away.  Will definitely plan for a return visit."}
{"text":"PASS!  Have been to this location 4 times now, it's close to work so I've been more than I would have liked to go. My co-workers seem to not mind this place but I will not be back again. I'll suggest a different place next time this one comes up in the rotation because I can't give them any more of my money. Everything I have ordered has been dry and flavourless and has never come out hot. Not cold..bordering on warm.  On the plus side this is a really cute restauraunt and there is a lovely patio.  We came here for lunch on the last occasion and for 6 of us it took almost 1 and 1/2 hours to get through lunch. S&P must know that there is a business crowd that rolls through on lunch, but they don't do much to help keep the lunch hour timely. All six of us ordered the same thing, mixed tacos, so I would think that would make it easier on the chef.   There are always chips and salsa served to start. The chips are cut really thick and are actually very difficult to eat. The salsa is nothing special, it actually doesn't have much flavour either. As for the tacos, there is a refried bean side that comes with the dish and it's the best part."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to update my previous rave review. After experiencing exceptional service the first few times I dined at S&P, I was so disappointed to receive seriously sub-par service the following 3 trips.  The first poor experience happend when myself and six others went for a supper on a rainy Inglewood-Night-Market evening this summer. We were given ~40 minute wait, which was totally fine by us (we knew that we would have to wait regardless of where we went that night). Despite much confusion about an hour later when people who came in after us (with about the same number in their parties) were being sat, we finally had a table upstairs in Lolita's. Great! So we ordered our food, including three baskets of chips and guac (still the best guac ever). About 30 minutes later, we are sitting there with empty glasses and no chips. The waiter finally comes over and tells us that he made a mistake and put the chips order in with the rest of our food. I asked if we could just have one basket then, as the table was tiny for 7 people as it was, and we likely wouldn't eat all the chips if they arrived when our meals did.  All meals finally arrive except mine. The waiter told me that they gave it to someone else and put a 'rush' on my order. Then he dashed away. About ten minutes later I stopped him to ask for the chips to hold me over, which took another 15 mins to arrive. Finally my food came, long after all my friends had finished their meals. He insisted I have dessert to make up for the error. I said I was too full at that point for dessert, so he comped the chips and guac on my bill.  The following two times after that were similar, where we were left to wait ages for our orders to be taken, and then the food came out either wrong or awful and soggy (the nachos!). I so desperately want the next time to be better given our first experiences were so positive, but they seem to lack strong management."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go and harass these poor folks in a group of 7 of us the other weekend.   First - Patio - LOVELY - really comfortable surroundings, nice ambience and pretty darn tasty mojitos and pina coladas.   Second - Food - Meh - It was really not much to write home about - it was okay, but nothing I couldn't have made better at home. But I'm lazy so - there it is. I had nachos to start (you know when you make nachos and they come out in one lump?), a quesidilla (not too bad, but again, nothing amazing). We skipped dessert. Friends had equally unimpressive foods.   The service staff were all very adorable, if still finding their land legs as S&P only re-opened earlier in the month. I don't mind servers who aren't 100% on, if they are respectful/ polite. These guys and gals definitely fell into that category.   The food, in combo with the beverages and the friends and the patio was pretty excellent. I think next time we'll go we'll just do shared appies and have a drink or two and enjoy their lovely patio."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service.   I went there for a night out with my boyfriend, which was ruined by the service.  We were sat at a table when the restaurant had lots of empty tables and waited a long time to order our drinks. The server was not welcoming at all and since we waited so long for him to even come to our table, we were ready to order our food at the same time. The food came out before we got our drinks, and I had to remind the server that we still needed our drinks. When we were done our food, we decided we would like some dessert, but once again waited forever for someone to even come get our plates.  We eventually just gave up and had to get up and find a different server to pay.  The other servers we not even nice to us when I told them I think we were forgotten about and were trying to pay. I also asked if there was complimentary chips and salsa since all the other tables but ours received some, but they told me we needed to order this - interesting since I've read otherwise on the comments here. Although the food was really good, I think you would have a better customer service experience from Taco Time. A damper to what was supposed to be a good night out.  Don't bother going here."}
{"text":"A great spot for meeting up with friends, this spot almost gets four stars for Margarita Mondays alone ($10 pitchers). The menu is quasi-authentic (Calgary has slim pickings in this category) with queso fresco and the like, and the dishes are deceivingly filling ... for example, the nachos come on a small plate, but are stacked high and have toppings all the way through."}
{"text":"The food at Salt & Pepper is amazing.  And the waiter was fantastic, very attentive and personable.  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. So yummy! The service was quick and I loved the after dinner mints. All I want is some more enchilladas. I would def go again."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with quality of food and service today. Usually great, but according to the kitchen manager (with a flippant attitude) they have \"other events going on today\" so they didn't bother to staff the restaurant properly. I felt bad for the staff that were trying, but clearly they lacked the support required to make sure customers were taken care of."}
{"text":"We have been looking for Mexican food since moving here two years ago and now we've found it! Tried the tacos and wow.   Chorizo tacos.   OMG Yes."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Taco Bell is better than this restaurant. Enchiladas seemed like they were cooked yesterday and reheated, they were burned and completely dried out. Margaritas were made from a mix and didn't taste boozy at all, even they were supposed to be doubles. Worst place to eat in Inglewood. Very overpriced for what it is, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to eat here, but unfortunately the service was inadequate and the insects unbearable. We were standing at the entrance, which was unmanned, with no sign saying if we should wait to be seated or if we had to seat ourselves. We were passed by servers numerous times until I eventually asked one if we had to wait or if we could just sit down, and we were informed someone would be right with us. We waited a while longer until someone came up (by this time there were 2 other groups waiting alongside us) and she informed us that they would try to figure out some arrangements since none of us had reservations. Eventually after some time we were sat inside by a window that featured around 4 dead wasps on the windowsill (not super appetizing) and one live one that would not leave us alone. We eventually just got up and left since we were so frustrated by the service and the insects. I am sure the food is good but unfortunately waiting for so long for a table only to be harassed by wasps is ridiculous.   I would give one star if I didn't feel bad for not even being able to try the food. Maybe this restaurant had an off day when we went but it will still very frustrating and there are many more restaurants around that would seat us quickly."}
{"text":"The food was awful. The meat was cold on the taco entree. We ordered the pitcher of margaritas and then ordered 4 shots because there was no alcohol in the margaritas. To top off the evening I went to the washroom and the girl coming out was the female sever and sadly the sink was not wet!!!!!! Ewwwwew!!!"}
{"text":"Salt and Pepper is now in the building formerly home to the Village Cantina.   First off: The staff. While the staff are all very nice, the service system is very confusing. There seems to be just a few servers, and tons of bussers. So it's hard to tell who is who. A number of times we asked the busser for something, only to be told \"I'll tell your server\". And most of the time that message/request gets relayed, but not all the time. The servers aren't around much, whereas there seems to be 4 bussers for every server.   Still with me?  The food is okay. Not the best Mexican I've ever had, but absolutely not the worst.  I will say, I like it better than the Village Cantina food.   Oh and, they have \"all you can eat\" taco tuesdays which are becoming very popular.  The place seems very clean, the patio is very nice, and the staff are nice. I've been 3 times. While I wouldn't be jumping up and down to go back, if someone suggested we go there I wouldn't say flat out no."}
{"text":"I think I actually want a 3.5 star rating for this one!  It was clean and not busy when we arrived but it took an awfully long time for the server to notice and seat us.  In her defense, she was the only one there other than the cook for about the first half hour we were there.  The food was good and the prices were no worse than anywhere else in Inglewood...and it didn't feel hipster-snobby like Bite.  Overall I was pleased and I would go again."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was terrible!  They were very understaffed and were very slow to serve customers.  We saw two tables of four walk out before even placing drink orders.  The very rude waitress even told a table that they were in for very slow service.  Drink refresh was extremely slow.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends while I was in Calgary. Our friend had recommended it and I was very impressed the stuffed peppers that were on my sampler plate. The margaritas were also very good which were on the daily special"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very friendly and down to earth server, beautifully rich and tasty food... everything about the food & vibe here was fantastic! One minor complaint would be that the servers are a bit slow (understaffed?) and... distracted I think. Despite this minor thing, I will definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today to celebrate dropping our boss off at the Stampede grounds on opening day. The service was great and our food was also very good.  I had the daily special which started with an avocado tomato soup-very yummy although a bit salty (but I think it was supposed to be that way).  My entre was a chicken breast topped with a Salsa De Tomatillo Verde served with a perfect portion of yummy refried beans and mexican rice. It reminded me of great tex mex I had over the last year in Austin TX. I think their portions were good for lunch as I'm ful but not needed a nap!  The drink special of the day were Mojito's-very good-fresh tasting. They also had a good selection of wine, beer and other drinks. The rest of my group seemed to enjoy their meals as well (everyone cleaned their plates).  Our server was great and we didn't feel rushed as you sometimes do at lunch. She knw the menu well and had great recommendations. We sat on the patio which was shaded and lovely.  I will be back the next time I'm craving Mexican"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes before we grabbed someone to take our order, then waited another 30 minutes before our order (3 entrées) arrived.  They claimed they were short staffed...but we watched other people arrive after us and get served.  Other tables also got chips while they waited, and we got to watch them eat their chips while we waited.  Save yourself some time and frustration, try anything else!"}
{"text":"I really hate writing bad reviews but unfortunately good service and good food are becoming harder to find.  We order to linguine in cream sauce with chorizo sausage and one Azteca soup. The cream sauce was a spaghetti sauce and was boring in flavour. The menu clearly says cream sauce leading us to believe it was a white sauce. When the dishes arrived we looked at each other confused and asked the server about the dish. She said she watched the chef put cream in it. She then came back with a take out menu and said if you kindly refer to this you will see it's a rose sauce. Well thats nice we didn't order from the takeout menu. She gets so flustered she sends over another server ( we are the only people in this place at 4 on Sunday ) to ask us about the meal. We explain the same thing. She leaves comes back and says oh sorry the lunch menu is old and every other menu it's written as a red sauce. She offered us free desert.  Overall no communication, servers are not knowledgable and the food was meh. I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I did.  It's in a great location.  It has a fabulous patio.  It has all you can eat tacos and Corona specials on Tuesday nights!  The joint should be jammed with happy taco-eating and beer-drinking people.    But it wasn't, and I can't precisely put my finger on what was flat about it.  The tacos turned out to be more like taquitos.  The wait staff were a little inexperienced and not good at explaining things.  But these are hardly deal breakers.    There was nothing wrong - just the experience was a little flat all over."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill big time. Way too pricey for what you get too. My husband and I popped in for a bite to eat while our son was at a birthday party nearby. We shared a combo plate that included a chili relleno , beef taco and mole burrito. We also got a side chili relleno b/c normally that is a favourite. We also got chips and salsa to share while we waited for our meal and were charged for it (nearly $5)! Our meal was not good. The chili rellenos weren't even the same. One was luke warm with weird processed style creamy cheese that really had a funky taste. At least the other one was hot but it didn't really make up for the taste. Both the taco and burrito were tough and hard which made me think the plate had been microwaved. The meat in the burrito was dry and might have been chicken but it was hard to tell. Service was OK. Won't be back. I make better Mexican food at home and my husbands margaritas can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Well, I have to say that Salt & Pepper used to be one of my favorite spots in Calgary. However, of late there have been so many great taquerias popping up, and others that I have discovered, where now I'm not so sure about S&P.  For instance, today I wanted a light lunch/snack so I ordered their guacamole, with some salsa on the side. Chips, good (as always), salsa also good (nice fresh jalapeño in there). The guacamole today though - meh. Not what I remembered it to be. Also, what really turned me off was that there seemed to be a layer of shredded iceberg lettuce at the bottom of the guacamole. What!!??! Sorry, that's kind of a deal-breaker for me (particularly  when they are charging nearly $8 for guac).  One thing that would renew my interest is if they made their tacos a little more à la carte, and ditched the cheese and sour cream. Most street tacos come with cilantro and a wedge of lime. Mainly though, I'd love to see lengua, al pastor and carne tacos. Barbacoa would also be delicious!   Please change your menu Salt & Pepper to reflect what most of your competition has done - making it easier to sample more of the menu.  On a happy note, their patio is lovely and still feels like a little getaway, despite being right on 9th Ave. They got an extra star just for that (and for my friendly server)."}
{"text":"YOU COULD NOT PAY ME ENOUGH MONEY TO RETURN TO THIS 'JOINT' (and literally I mean the term 'joint')  A girlfriend and I were there last Friday around 3PM after a nice walk about Inglewood, when we entered there were 4-5 other tables and only 1 server who was nice enough however when we ordered appetizers she did not ensure there were any napkins, she barely stopped by for beverage refills, and when our entrees finally arrived there was no cutlery... we had to get up and ask for it ourselves...  Not to mention the shrimp cocktail we had tasted like plastic, old, frozen shrimp dipped in tomato sauce with absolutely no cocktail, and the chicken in our enchiladas was so dry I should have called Chef Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares to inspect the place... when we commented on the rate of service and our experience thus far the server simply stated she was \"the only one there today\" as if that's an excuse...  If in Inglewood look elsewhere, I'm sure there must be something better around the corner..."}
{"text":"We were in Inglewood walking around which got us hungry for some good food. We noticed this Salt & Pepper Mexican restaurant and i had to check it out! My companion had been here before and ahe said it was great. So we walked in and sat in their shaded patio. We ordered chips and salsa & guacamole and Aguacate con Camarones (Avocado boat with shrimp in cocktail sauce) which was sweet and the avocado mellowed that dish. The chips were warm and i loved the pickled Jalapenos. Our main course i had the beef fajita served with 3 warm tortillas and all the fixings the beef was cooked in a small type of wok with peppers and onions ina tomato sauce, which i have never eaten fajitas that was before since in most places its served on a hot plate. The tomato sauce was really good. My partner ordered the Cheese Enchiladas with a tomato basil sauce instead of the mole sauce. Which she was glad she did. Both dishes were flavorful and was a nice choices we made. The food is not spicy by any means, which i wish it was a little. But these dishes would be enjoyed by kids. The flavours were Mexican but catered to the Canadian crowd. We finished off with the 4 milk cake, which was a great finishing to a good meal. The service was great! She refilled my drinks and was pleasent and made suggestions when asked."}
{"text":"I've had Salt n Pepper 3 times in the last 2 months for various occasions.  My favourite part - the free nachos and salsa. They're usually fresh and delicious, although they were a little off the last time.   The food is decent. Some is great, some is meh. I had tequila chicken my first time. It was really tasty but the chicken was butterflied too thin and it dried it out around the edges.   Second time I had a couple tacos. The beef one was lacking flavour and the pork one was alright. I wouldn't have them again.  My latest trip I ordered the special. It was described as a salad with chicken and pickled cactus. It turned out to be a chicken breast on a bed of sauteed veg with a little pile of cactus on top. Not what I was expecting, but really good! The cactus tastes a lot like green pepper, so it was like a chicken fajita without the tortilla."}
{"text":"Food is nothing special, the service was awful. The waiter was polite but took forever to take our order, bring our food and the bill, we weren't in a rush but it was ridiculous how long everything took. I ordered enchiladas with mole and one section of the enchilada that wasn't covered in mole sauce was dry and a bit hard. The mole was very plain and I have had much better.  I had Salt & Pepper on macleod trail years and years ago and vowed I wouldn't go back because it so exceptionally \"meh\" but I wanted to give it a shot again and I unfortunately this experience didn't change my mind and I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing patio and the drinks are ok but just skip the food. It's not great - they can't even cook the rice correctly or make a good quesadilla. Yikes"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! So glad we went to try!  We are avid Mexico goers and although we have only been back for a few weeks now, we were craving Mexican food! This place fits the bill!  The restaurant is cozy and Mexico-charming without being tacky. Even the washroom was cute and most importantly, clean!  We went for a late lunch and it was nice to avoid the crowds and have much of the place to ourselves. Our waiter was efficient and polite but he gets one star deducted  just because he was less than enthusiastic. This could just be his mannerism but still can make or break the total experience.  The food is the best Mexican I think I have had in Canada. For sure the best in Calgary that we have had thus far. Thanks to one of my fellow Yelpers who told me about the Salt and Pepper website that houses a free coupon for taquitos at this location (and Bowness)! The coupon was readily accepted and man, that appy was GOOD! Crunchy, tasty tortillas, real Mexican cheese and the sour cream had a depth to it I just cannot describe! The guac did not beat my guac but it was very good. I loved the Spanish onions they use in everything, really kicks the dishes up a few notches!  We ordered a chorizo quesadilla and chicken enchiladas with the tomato basil sauce over top. Both 5 star! I will crave both until I get to go back. I had a margarita which I had heard were amazing. When I first got it, I was not so sure as it looked a little milky but when I did not stop drinking it and the glass was half empty in 2.1 seconds, this proved to be a sign that it was indeedy an amazing drink. It did not taste all processed and cheap like some places. It was however, double the price of the mojitos which were on for $4. My spouse had this and he quite liked it. For once I ate all of my plate of food but we had to pass on dessert. Too full!  The music was a decent mix of Mexican and the volume was good.  I was told that the owner of this Inglewood location and that of the Bowness is the same. The cooks alternate between each restaurant - a couple of days at this one, a couple at the other one. Whatever they are doing, they are doing it right!  Buen apetito!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, unacceptably slow. The food was awful as well. The tacos were deep fried rolls with some chicken in the middle, much like the taquito's that 7-11 sell (great profit for S&P if that is where they get these things!). Very sad to see the state of decline in what was once a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"An under-rated Mexican restaurant! I was very happy with my food and service!"}
{"text":"When I lived near COP I use to go for taco Tuesday all the time, loved this place! I need to go back since the renovations, hopefully they have maintained there quality Mexican food! Was the only place according to my GF we could find authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday when the special of the night was Sangria and got a pitcher. We couldn't decide between white or red but they only serve red so that was an easy decision. It has green apples and oranges in it and was delicious.  The menu is small which I like because then it makes it easier to decide and they really let you customize the orders to be the way you like it so it is great.  For example with the enchiladas that I for you had a choice between beef, chicken, pork, chorizo, vegetable or cheese and the meal came with three enchiladas but you didn't have to get all three the same. For example I got one beer enchilada, one chicken enchilada and one veggie enchilada. Then for sauces they have choices of mole, bean or tomato basil and you can also mix and match with that you don't have to get just one sauce so I got half bean and half tomato basil.  The portions are not to small and not overly big as well. Prices are good too :)"}
{"text":"Great! Good food, good mojitos, good tequila. Was a Frank Sinatra performance upstairs, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place but never got the chance. We went on Mother's Day and fully expected it to busy. To my surprise we stood at the entrance for close to 7 minutes without be acknowledged. I then walked in and politely asked if someone was gonna let us know how long or great is and I was told we will get to you when we can. Poor etiquette as I would have waited 30 minutes if i had to but was turned off from the lack of care for their customers. We got the feeling like they wanted us to leave. Too bad as I have wanted to eat here for years and will not more than likely now."}
{"text":"I received the worst meal ever from this place...the wraps looks like they were left over from the previous table.  It looked like they cleaned the floor with the wraps.  So dirty and unpresentable!   Would never return it was so bad!"}
{"text":"This is the 4th location I've been two (2 have since closed) and I was really underwhelmed at this location.   Service wasn't very good.   Our server sat us, took our order (with a large delay), and brought us our bill 30 minutes after we finished and he'd walked by 3-4 times as we waved.   There was no other interaction...  if I hadn't seen him serving other dinners I would have assumed there was a shift change and no one assigned our table.   The food wasn't great.   My enchiladas fell apart and were just extra mush in the sauce.  The veggies inside were too crisp.  My meal was mostly tomato mush with raw veggies with rice and beans and I finished feeling very unsatisfied and didn't pack anything up to leave (even if my server had offered).   Salt and Pepper is quite costly.... and often is pretty tasty making it worth it but not at this location on the day we went.  I'm not sure if it was a bad day or if it's worth a mulligan based on previous experiences at different locals.  I don't make it to Inglewood very often without dining plans established so it's probably not a likely possibility for me anyway."}
{"text":"Met some friends for Saturday afternoon patio time and this place fit the bill perfectly.  The patio is covered so you get lovely fresh air without broiling in the sun.  The decor on the patio is rustic with lots if plants.  Lovely strings of lights for that moody ambiance once the sun goes down.   Our service was fantastic with a group of 7. Our waiter made some nice recommendations on appys had the drinks replenished promptly and was very personable.   Price is reasonable and portions are generous.  I'm not a Mexican food aficionado but I think their menu is very tasty.   The ceviche is fresh the sauces flavourful and the meat is lean and tasty.   Definitely recommend this gem in Inglewood for drinks or meals or both."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and authentic Mexican cuisine. However, the service was horrendous...  They were swamped and understaffed, but c'mon, it was a sunny Friday night. Has to be one of your busiest, especially since its patio season, and Fringe Fest had a showing next door.  It took ages for a server to approach us, ages to get drinks. We flagged someone down to get another order of margaritas. They never arrived, but we were charged for them. Flagged someone down for a water refill. Flagged someone down to order coffees. They took 25 minutes to arrive. Quite frankly we were bored by this time. We're just about to cancel our coffees and get the bill when they finally appeared. got our waiters attention to get the bill, and we were outta there.  Ran into a couple outside, thinking of trying it out. I highly discouraged them from stepping foot in that place at that moment.  I most certainly loved the food, and the margaritas were yummy. I would have spent more $ if the service was on par.  Lovely patio, worth a look, on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Where to begin.  After waiting 10 minutes to be seated on a slow afternoon we got chips and salsa to kick things off. For a place that claims they're one of the best restaurant choices in town for 20 years, they sure don't seem to put much pride in their food or drinks.   Chips were stale. Defiantly last nights leftovers.   Margaritas were sub standard at best. I'm not sure how you can mess up lime and tequila but evidently it's possible.   The main course was decent. Rice was under cooked and the portion size of the sides was laughable. Enchiladas were pretty flavourful actually so it wasn't a complete train wreck.   Look, if you're going to make claims about how great your restaurant is in your menu, it would probably be a good idea to actually live up to that standard. Making outlandish claims opens you up to ridicule, and you earned it today.  Visit the Magpie in Banff if you want a great food experience. Leave Salt & Pepa in the 90's where they belong."}
{"text":"I visited Salt & Pepper on a date with my sister. Mainly because I had a hankering for Mexican food and since I'd been here for drinks a few weeks ago, I thought I'd try out the food.  Pitchers of margaritas are pretty much 1/3 the price on Mondays. It's an awesome deal and the margaritas are good. Highly recommended, so long as you drink responsibly :)  We each had a margarita and were pleasantly surprised to find out the guacamole/chips is complimentary on Wednesdays. The guac was really great, especially with the chunks of tomato & onion in it. Yum!  I had printed out a coupon from the website but neglected to find the item on the menu and since we got a free appy anyway decided against asking the server about it.  We decided to share the fajitas - often far too large a meal for one but perfect for two, especially after an appy. But this one was disappointingly small. As in, only comes with 2 small tortillas and the actual dish is quite small as well. While the chicken was swimming in a tomato sauce, I was disappointed that a salsa didn't come with the fajitas. And not enough veggies. Otherwise, fajita toppings were good.  Server was nice, albeit wasn't reading us altogether too well and seemed a little pushy at times.   Note: This location & the one in Bowness are owned by the same person (who happens to be the son of the people who own the Macleod Tr location). I need to visit the latter location again, as I remember liking it more. The server said that these two locations were very similar, and Macleod was different...  (22/30)"}
{"text":"The location must be keeping this place afloat. The patio is beautiful. Those are the only positives for this place.  Walked by on a Friday night and decided to go in, there was a line up but it was nearly empty inside. The hostess also seemed to be the only clearing the tables.  Our server, who didn't introduce himself came by after quite some time, which turned out to be a blessing since we could order drinks and our food, I don't know if we would have seen him again to take another order from us. Our food took FOREVER to come out. I don't think it should take that long to make tacos and fajitas. Our water glasses were never refilled and my husband wasn't even sure there was booze in his margarita.  The food was just ok, but maybe I was just so hungry I hardly tasted it. I'm pretty sure one of the chorizo tacos I ordered was chicken, I didn't want to send it back for fear of it taking another 45 min for it to come back correctly.   We asked our hostess for the bill which took another 10 min for our server to bring it out, which was the second time we saw him the whole evening.  Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Though the food was not the greatest known to man. It was pretty good. The server was ok. She had just started, so I don't want to discount the place because of it. I think I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant more than anything. I would definitely go again next time I decide to visit Calgary."}
{"text":"A while back, a friend of mine got tickets to \"Carly's Angels\", a musical variety show showcasing three of Calgary's most beautiful, most talented and most hilarious drag queens. I was lucky enough to get my grubby little hands on two of those tickets, because the shows tend to sell out MONTHS in advance.   The show occurs in Club Paradiso, the upstairs. It started around nine, and our group ordered a few appetizers and sat back waiting for the show. Carly herself came out, resplendent in a shiny dress and totally gorgeous and TALL. She was snarky and honest and wonderful. The crowd was mostly women with some gay and straight men thrown into the mix. The jokes Carly got on those suckers were the best of the night. Actually, she sent Zingers out to the whole audience.  There was lot's of Liza and Cher, and Carly and her two angels were great and super funny. I loved how they got everyone involved, and Club Paradiso was packed but small enough that they did a great job.   Carly's Angels is much recommended by me. Uber funny!  About Club Paradiso: The service was great and so was the food. The drinks were a little expensive, and it seemed like a really nice bar. The space was small and intimate with a very nice second floor patio. I've been meaning to go back!"}
{"text":"It's everything you don't want in Mexican food. Small portion, not enough cheese or sauce and soggy unappetizing ingredients. Enchiladas are 3 tiny taco shells with barely any meat. The sides of rice and beans shouldn't be bigger than the main course. Sad."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Margaritas were delicious and quesadillas were so delicious! I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a quick bit of food on your way through Calgary! Service was fast which we definitely appreciated! Great food, great restaurant, I wish we had one in Edmonton!"}
{"text":"Although we had been here, at my partner's recommendation, a few years ago, we had not returned until Thursday night (Christmas in Inglewood). The annual event brings a crowd to the little district and any business that's been around knows the impact of a fair weather night for such an evening. That didn't stop this restaurant from forgetting (?) to schedule staff. Two people on the floor and I believe one was the manager and he whispered incoherently if he came around at all. A broken high hair was provided when we were asked to put our stroller at the opposite end of the restaurant (with all our Christmas shopping and our wallets!). We refused but tucked it neatly and discreetly behind our table, out of the way though it somehow still wound up moved later on in the evening (without our permission). I say later on as we attempted to give this place a chance and became trapped with only stale tortilla chips to keep us and our infant daughter company for a couple of hours (did I mention infant!?!) while the business figured out what to do with actual customers. Frustrated, we hoped that after replacing the broken high chair and feeding our daughter from a bag (what we had on us) because no one came to offer/ask if we wanted anything, we thought at least the food might be decent. If you consider what tasted like canned beans, canned rice, over cooked prawns and cold fundido good then come check out this place. The cheese was hard, congealed! The THREE fajita shells were the size of cookies and we inevitably ran out the door in frustration and hungry and wondering why we were chasing them for a bill. NOT returning again. Two poor experiences were all we needed to prove that some people should not run restaurants."}
{"text":"Have been here quite a few times. And I'm not a big fan of Mex cooking. But they do some interesting variants here. Very pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a large group of people and despite the disappointing reviews on yelp, I had a couple of friends that assured me that it was a good spot. A must in any Mexican place is to get the guacamole. This might've been the first sign as there was something really off about the guac (maybe the lime or some ingredient wasn't fresh) and on top of that, why is there shredded iceberg lettuce at the bottom?? It wasn't totally unappetizing, but a serious letdown (seriously how can you screw up guac).   A friend and I got the chef's platter to share. The pork chops were a little overcooked which made them a little tough and bland. The burrito was a decent size to share and I really enjoyed the chicken enchiladas and the simple cheese quesadilla. it also came with the weird guac. I didn't have much of the chili rellano as I was pretty full. Beware of the stem though. It's not edible as I have discovered...   I split an order of the tres leches cake afterwards which had the perfect amount of sweetness to it and wasn't heavy at all, overall it was divine!   Our server was super organized and attentive considering the large group, so kudos to her. The patio is cute and definitely a must as the inside is pretty warm. Overall, it was a meh experience. The guac is what unfortunately is a make or break deal for me so I'll probably check out other Mexican places for the future."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim in March. It was a slow Tuesday and had great service (place to ourselves, actually). They have a taco Tuesday special that will fill your belly to the brim. I really don't have anything negative to say. Great experience, will be back for another go at taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Bees, Bees, and more Bees... oh and the Mexican food!   Today, started great. The day was packed with socializing under sunny skies, a music festival, and happy smiling friends in tow. We felt festive so why not hit a festive Mexican restaurant? We've never been to Salt & Pepper before but they have an outdoor patio area. Unfortunately, you have to take the good with the bad at this time of year (eg. loud street noise and harassment from wasps).   The Good - Food tasted great. No question this was the best part of this visit to S&P. We ordered four different meals and all were well prepared, nicely plated, full of flavour, and not over-done. I read some negative reviews about the food but there was nothing to complain about here. We all agreed the food was delicious. I couldn't stop eating until my plate was clean, which says a lot about how good it tasted. The location being in Inglewood made for a nice walk before and after we ate.   The NOT Bad - The server was nice, concerned about our satisfaction, gave attention to detail (as he could afford time for), and you could tell he was trying his best to meet the needs of a number of customers (probably too many at once). That said, it was hard to track him down when we needed something because he was constantly running around. The atmosphere should really be part of \"the Good\" but they were playing odd music like Scottish pipe music - not Mexican music - in a stylized Mexican restaurant.   The Bad - The wasps were harassing everyone in the patio area. People actually got up and moved inside it was so bad. They really need to hire a bee person to setup wasp traps or locate the wasp nest nearby and eradicate it. This almost ruined my time as I was constantly fighting them off.  The Ugly - Long wait for food and drinks. I read about the wait times here on the way over but sometimes that is just a one-time thing so we went anyway. Unfortunately, it was true. We waited an hour for our food to be served after we ordered it. My co-horts were not impressed or as patient as I was. The kitchen makes tasty food but they do need to work some efficiencies into their back-end processes.   So if you don't mind a long wait - there are no complaints about the food. With a few improvements to the delivery and the music they would see more stars.  We will probably give S&P another try at some point as we liked the atmosphere, the location, and as noted above - the food was good.  All the best S&P,  Shane K.  p.s. Please deal with the wasps!"}
{"text":"I will admit I was reticent about Salt & Pepper given the varied reviews but my brother and I went in finally and were pretty impressed.  A cute, traditional Mexican design replete with soundtrack and complimentary nachos and fresh salsa. I had the special which opened with a steak and vegetable soup that was bursting with flavour and piping hot and headlined with the chicken enchilada that pretty much shut conversation down at the table. Even my brother, who had the Tacos, Tacos, Tacos, actually said \"I can't talk, this is too good.\" Tall order for both of us, I know. We showed up in the middle of lunch rush and we were out in about an hour. Our servers - although I found them to be kind if curt, serious - were friendly, very skilled, and I was asked no less than twice how lunch was. I said I was really happy and would be back. The two things that stuck out here were the full and intense flavour of our dishes and the fact they were hot out of the oven. Quite a benchmark, but it will be the benchmark they have to live up to second time through. Stay tuned for Part 2..."}
{"text":"I'm going with four stars. Mostly because of the server and the manager.  The food is average. Tasty but not exceptional. Portions were a little small. Overall a three star. I've been to the Bowness location and would give it a 2 star because of the pooooor service and average food.  What really stood out and will have us going back again was the manager who came over as we were leaving to make sure we had a good meal. As well, he commented on how the staff in the kitchen could hear our laughter - the kind of laughter that came from the heart and soul. They just knew we were happy.  Yah, I know, you're wondering how that equals another star. But when was the last time you had a manager come up to you and emphatically express his sincere appreciation for coming into the business? When did a manager or staff say your laugh was infectious and the staff felt the joy?  I certainly don't remember ever getting that kind of compliment. So to the manager and staff, \"you made our day, just as much as we made yours\"!  Go to Salt and Pepper in Inglewood.  It's not perfect but it is pretty good and I like supporting a local business and family."}
