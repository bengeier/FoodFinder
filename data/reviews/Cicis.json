{"text":"We came here on a Friday around 5:00. I was a little nervous because of the other reviews but all in all it was a great experience. It's not like I was expecting much for 4.99. We have 3 kids and since kids under 4 eat free we fed our family for under $20! The pizza was fresh and hot and they kept different varieties coming out all the time. The tables were clean as were the bathrooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would absolutely go back to this location."}
{"text":"Definetely my favorite place to eat when I'm low on cash. This place is a wrestler dream. They make any pizza you desire and all you have to do is ask. For a 7 dollar buffet it's definetely your best bet for cheap!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed there had to be at 5 to 7 people on duty and the pizza was hard and cheese was all dried out the kids running it were more concerned about bickering back and forth about there video games and social life then helping customers and keeping the place clean the only person working hard was an older gentle named Tim and all the pizza you tried to pick up fell off onto the counter because they can't figure out how to slice a pizza so you can pick it up without four other pieces attached I literally watch at least five people get pissed of and have to grab two tools to cut the pizza again to grab a slice. The deserts had also been out way to long the cinnamon rolls were hard as a rock the staff could literally care less."}
{"text":"OMG !! I don't know how this dam place got good ratings !!!!! The pizza was dry blan and tasted spoiled and it was stale and hard greasy and gummy like wtf ?? Nasty ass good like wow even the cinnamon rolls tasted fake you can taste the sugar grains and the dough taste just like BOOTY AND ASS !!!! Oh and the pizza dough taste like carpet and dirt and dog breathe !!!! DONT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!! NOTHING LIKE THEIR COMMERCIALS OR WEBSITE. The place is GHETTO!! The floors are filthy and the buffet is a complete joke. Sauce tastes like plain tomato sauce from a can. The salad bar is disgusting along with the old dry pasta that looked like it had been sitting there forever. I was completely embarrassed that we chose this place to take my parents and kids to eat lunch at. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"This place is full of germs and got me sick. The restaurant is filthy and the manager needs to scrub the place and get a more sanitary system for serving food. I wash my hands before I eat every time, but think about how many dirty hands touch the pizza server handle. This is disgusting, you grab the handle and then go eat pizza with those hands. I wish I thought about this before they got me sick. Do yourself a favor & use a napkin to hold the handle. Better yet, get Papa Johns instead, it's way better."}
{"text":"My kids love it.   I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  But my kids LOVE it.   So take that as what you will.  My kids think the pizza is great.  But then Again they think instant microwave Mac n cheese is great also... Sooo there you have it."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever read a more consistent series of reviews, everyone else has hit the nail on the head!   It's cheap and okay, that's about it. They have currently lowered their buffet price to $3.99...as if that would suddenly attract all the folks holding out on that dollar. The drink price is $1.49 and an extra $0.50 if you want a 32oz to-go cup.   Pizza is about what I expected...basically the type that would taste a lot better at 2:15 am on a Friday night. However, the selection is good and they certainly keep them coming. The cinnamon roll things really do live up to the hype and I would come back if only to eat just those. The brownies were good too.   The only thing I didn't really care for was the pasta sauce, yuck, not good and the other patrons, a bit of a seedy crowd in this location. Oh, I could also do without the overzealous greeting upon each customer's entry, but I guess it's nice to have my presence acknowledged.   Thanks for the swill Cici's, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This location just opened recently.  I was quite surprised when I walked in.  For it's location I thought surely it would be full off all sorts of trashy people.  Turns out I was the biggest ruffian in the whole place.  The food was much better than what I remember from my last Cici's experience.  I didn't even feel like puking after I left.  Maybe that's because I kept it to 4 plates this time.  As always, the staff is friendly and you'll get a big, \"Welcome to Cici's\" upon entering the building.  Stop on in, just don't forget your coat and tie!"}
{"text":"I was there with my family yesterday and the bathrooms where dirty,they where slow with putting out hot fresh product.It was wasn't even bussy we where there at 3 in the afternoon the staff was Polite the trash was over flowing"}
{"text":"Great food selection on their buffet, but love the special order option. Great prices, but not always great service hence the four stars. Good salad bar with multiple toppings. Drinks are a bit overpriced for basic soda, but water is better anyway. Overall, my kids love it and I can feed a family of six for under $40 so can't complain. Will continue to frequent Cicis in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. To start with it smells funny. Nobody that works there looks to be over the age of 18. When you walk in they are required to say \"welcome to cici's\" and it just sounds so disingenuous. The lettuce had turned that brown color, broccoli tasted unwashed. Pizza was undercooked. I'm only giving them two stars because the spinach pizza wasn't half bad but it was not worth it. Buy Little Caesar's and a head of lettuce and skip this place."}
{"text":"Food was ok for the most part,  but if you wanted to use a fork, knife or spoon, you had to use a dirty one.  Mentioned it to the person in charge & was told \"they are clean. I just took them out if the dishwasher myself.\"  I then showed him that I could & had to scrape the gunk off with my fingernail.  \"That's how they come out of the dishwasher so they are clean.\"  I asked if he could have someone hand wash some so we could finish our dinner.  \"Let me see if we can even do that\".     All of the above happened 10-15 minutes ago. ....still no clean utensils! !     I ended up going into the restroom and washed them myself so family could finish eating the food we already paid for."}
{"text":"Okay, we just went here (have to see what's in the neighborhood!) and I'll tell ya, there are pros and cons...  Pro's: Jalapenos in the salad bar to put on bland pizza, pasta for the kiddos, kids can pick their own and feel big. That crazy mac and cheese pizza. The crust is bready/soft (better than cardboard).   Con's: most were lacking flavor, texture. It's cheap pizza that they shuttle out in a variety of ways, I picked up a couple plates that were dirty before getting to a clean one. They had brownies for dessert... I didn't even try one because of how they looked :(  2 adults, 2 kids, 4 drinks $28.24 (not worth it, but we tried)"}
{"text":"This location is very very dirty . restrooms were very very disgusting . No one coming to clear your table I seen 7 tables with plates piled high for over 30 minutes did not see one person checking on guests , the management of this location needs to clean this place up if this is what the lobby looks like I will not be back . It's not just dirty from a lunch rush it's grimey from not cleaning it  for years . walls vents even there air conditioner up and down buttons where just ewwww"}
{"text":"It is, what it is...nothing more, nothing less.  If you want to shove slice upon slice into your cake hole, then this is the place...if you are looking for a taste of Italy, look elsewhere.  The place was pretty packed when I arrived and I must say that the service and the attitudes of the employees was pretty good, and because it was crowded the pizza's just kept on coming.  The salad and pasta bar wasn't anything to ride home about however the place was pretty clean.  Fine dining, no, cake hole friendly, yes!"}
{"text":"It's pizza, duh it's awesome. Good and very friendly management. Can't complain."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if I could. This place is filthy! My shoes stuck to the floor, there was stuck on food on the table, chairs, and floors. The worst part was the wall we were sitting next to had food dropped down it! And dust hanging off it towards the top. The window sill also was covered in dust and had finger marks where someone must have touched it. I got so nauseous by the filth that I couldn't continue eating, I don't trust that their kitchen is any cleaner than the area they let the public see. I would stay away from this location unless you enjoy eating in filth."}
{"text":"All i can say is i wont be going back to this location .... the worker was makeing sexual comments and i didnt even want to go back up to the buffet so we just left ..... i will be tring another location in the future !!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here bc I was craving pizza & I've seen this place a few times while driving by. Came in the early afternoon & was able to take advantage of the $5.49 all you can eat deal. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted with a \"Welcome to Cici's\" yell from both the cashier & I'm assuming the manager. Problem was that I was yelled at just as I was placing a foot in the door. It didn't seem welcoming at all(if they were going for that) just robotic.   Paid for our meals & began to make our drinks & find a table to sit at. When scanning the very loud dining area (lots of kids/teenagers) I found a fairly large table with stacks of plates, cups, napkins & pizza crumbs all over the place. As we finally grabbed some pizzas to try, we sat & tried it. The pizza is nothing special. I got what I paid for. Didn't even attempt to try the pasta or salad bar bc it looked bland & not appetizing. After being there for about 20 mins, someone came & finally cleans the large table of mess. I mean it was just sitting there for who knows how long. That seemed unprofessional. There was a manger walking around looking at the tv & chatting at guests & he never took the time to clean the area. He even joked with a table nearby about the mess.   I will never come back here. I would pay double the price for better pizza, service & cleanliness."}
{"text":"This was the worst CiCi's that I have ever been too.  We stood at the front and waited for at least 10 minutes before someone even greeted us.  They didn't have any utensils out, the soda machine tasted funky.  The food was terrible, the salad was old and soggy, they couldn't keep up with the pizza bar, and the dessert rolls that they put out were straight out dough!  When I said something, they said would take them off.  We sat at our table, just to see how long it would take them to remove it from the bar.  Well, we waited for 10-15 minutes and they didn't.  So, me and my daughter swore that we will never set foot in that location ever again."}
{"text":"What can you say. All you can eat pizza buffett for under 6 dollars.  They do have the most excellent buffalo chicken pizza. It brings to mind the joke. Sex is like pizza, when its good its great. When its bad its still pretty good."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this place. I visited this location on June 20th 2017 around 4:30pm. The staff was friendly but the food was below average compared to all the chains outside of the city and state. The pizzas were low in selection, there was only really 3 options; cheese, pepperoni, and vegetarian. The quality of the pizzas were dry, like over heat lamp dry. Pasta and salads were good, but the desserts were also slim as well. The only dessert out on the buffet was the cinnamon rolls and they were made with a little to much sodium. This is the first Cisis I have seen were they don't bus the tables either."}
{"text":"disgusting restaurant. I will never go back. the bathrooms were filthy, toilets had turds in them, tables were dirty, my mother found hair in her pizza. the manager didn't even apologize he sent one of his employees to give a free buffet card when i paid for two buffets. and on my way out he was laying in one of the booths just talking to someone. worst place ever!"}
{"text":"This 5-star review is based on overall experience, as opposed to culinary \"deliciousness\", although the pizza was pretty good!   My 4th graders and I recently took our yearly field trip to this location as part of our \"Fractions Unit\".  When we arrived, the staff was completely ready to go, despite the fact that they were swamped making the pizza orders for the local high school.  The general manager himself happily greeted my students, took them on a personal tour of the location, and answered all their questions with patience and a smile on his face.  Everything was clean, organized, and everyone was very accommodating!  In regards to the food, everything was fresh, hot and tasted great! The students were all allowed to decorate their own pizzas, and the staff encouraged them to be creative with their pepperoni designs.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience, and I know the kids and I both had a great time!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.   First, the place is disgustingly dirty. Your feet literally stick to the floor when you walk. I would love to see some sort of health inspection because there is no way it is up to code.   Second, the food is below average. I've been to different locations where the food was much better.   Do yourself a favor and order Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Buffet prices good. had a special...5.99 for adolt...2nd adult 3.99. Came to 15.10 with drinks for two. I guess with these prices i cant really complain about the lowgrade pizza. Bring the kids...they will eat it up. This place is tge epitome of \"you get what you pay for\". I give them three stars for delivering exactly what you pay for."}
{"text":"I mean... the food is edible... but everything seems to be pretty dry. As if all the food has been lying out all day...  I've never seen the place busy.. but it's cool.   I'll go here if I'm starving... but probably not again. Seems every cicis pizza I go to their having a \"bad day\" or something. I  haven't had a good experience yet.... Sorry. Just being honest."}
{"text":"Cashier was very helpful and polite. Food was fresh and consistently cooked. They have daily deals and we paid $5.99 for the dinner buffet. The brownies seemed undercooked but that seems the standard cook for CiCi's. All of the pizza tasted great!"}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest Cici's I have ever been to. It's my grandsons favorite place (a different location) so since we passed it it thought we would give it a try. The keyboard at the cash register is covered in soot. The windows are covered with nasty fingerprints. The bathroom is in need of a uhaul - not only are two of the three stall doors broken but it was filthy and there were no paper towels to dry your hands. We couldn't leave fast enough. $13 down the drain"}
{"text":"This Ci-Ci's is right around the corner from me, so we come here when we need to eat fast and cheap!!!    For all those that gave a 1-2 star rating before me...  How much do you spend on pizza at a normal place?  I bet it's at LEAST twice as much for how much you eat.  Now think about the cost of making all that pizza, and complain about it not being the \"freshest\" ingredients...  Oh wait did you get a FRESH salad with FRESH toppings too?  Probably not, but I do every time.  I eat the Pasta too.  I can get the soup although I usually don't, when I have it was good.   Quit complaining about a family friendly place where the kids 3 and under eat for free...  With the bread sticks that taste as good as theirs does!  Management and staff are always pleasant.  My child has food allergies, so I bring his ingredient substitutions, and they make it GLADLY for him."}
{"text":"The pizza is just average.  The price is good especially if you are going to eat in bulk which I think is the best reason to go here.  If you want really good pizza, go to Angelo's in Lakewood."}
{"text":"All the soda flavors are flat. The Pizza is good for the money. The salad bar is good. Try the house dressing in the yellow top container, it tastes just like olive gardens. Saw a small unattended kid though ... He was picking up the small tomatoes, sucking on them, then blowing them back into the salad, seriously. Can get loud at times. But like I said, all the soda's are flat. They were flat about a month ago too. I asked the manager, they went and checked something and said everything is working OK. So don't say I warned you. Unless they finally made a change, go for the water."}
{"text":"Who owns this place the nasty boys? Wack!"}
{"text":"We'll run staff, cleaner store, employees polite and manager seemed very efficient!!!  Store was ran it seemed like family owned with tons of care and hard work!!!"}
{"text":"The management staff the crew this is so extremely dirty and pour beer and I would not suggest coming here not ever bring anyone kids or my future kids ever to this establishment"}
{"text":"Wow, just watched the girl who takes the pizza out of the oven and puts them on the bar tie up her hair wipe her nose and and clean pizza she dropped on the floor without washing her hands and just keep touching food contact surfaces. This place should be closed. Totally dirty."}
{"text":"After contacting the corporate office this particular Cici's seemed to get on the ball. It's much better than it used to be. A decent value if you like a lot of pizza. Still often pretty dirty though."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and cheap, only cost $15 for two people and it's all you can eat. They don't have a variety of pizzas but I really enjoyed what they had, like the stuffed crust pizza. Yummy. They have salads too. I wasn't too much of a fan of their pasta, it tasted kinda watery. And I think they only have two different desserts, chocolate brownies and cinnamon rolls, which were pretty good actually. It's not the fanciest place to eat, but it's a good place and the price is low. The workers are super nice as well, they greet you walking in and wish you a good day walking out. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Ahhh cici's pizza...although they didn't have the 4.99 deal, the pizza was good none the less and the cinnamon buns...MmMMMmmm!!! I'd just pay the buffet price for that!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight. Ordered a special pizza that wasn't on the pizza bar and it was never delivered. Manager was too busy texting on his cell phone to once walk around the restaurant. Poor service."}
{"text":"The tables are so close together several of the chairs are unusable even for children. The tables were filthy and we couldn't find a clean place to eat. We visited at lunch and several of the pizzas were cold. None of the soda choices would mix correctly so we had the sweet tea which was so hot it was steaming and melted a full cup of ice. We also saw one of the kitchen staff accidentally hit another in the head with a stack of large metal trays as he plowed through the kitchen area. I feel like I need to go home and take a shower after eating here."}
{"text":"Somebody please call the DEA. There has to be a reason there are that many meth heads and junkies in one place. I ate with one hand and kept the other on my pistol. Central El Paso TX with all the cartels feels like one of those liberal \"safe spaces\" compared to this place."}
{"text":"Pizza good if u have them make it fresh.... Other than that food horrible cold and nasty I rather eat lil caesar any day of the week.... The salad bar not enough veggies the lettuce was wilted I asked the Manager Hector the person who \"supposed to be in charge\" for new lettuce he ask Y.... Nothing wrong with it.... So I started explaining he got mad and snatched the pan and walked away.... Came back with some fresh lettuce... But hey different strokes for different folks... You be the Judge!!! I can go on and on but I don't have the time... But before I go I will say this the workers that work there is just as wilted as the lettuce they try to serve me.... They had a very wack team working on Feb 4 2016.... I will never return!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to get me to give up 20 dollars, but that's what I did today. Just gave it away because, honestly, I've had pizza from Chuck E Cheese that trounced this pizza quality. At least half the tables were dirty and had yet to be bussed. My wife and I got about two bites in to the fare this insult to the pizza world is slinging and decided that we were going to leave. Do. Not. Go."}
{"text":"Not going to this certain CiCi ever again. Ordered a custom pizza to find out that they never made it, even though I checked up on it about three times. When the manager hands the pizza to me, it was cold and seemed like he didn't give two shits about anything. Went over to get pasta, to have the manager take away everything and coming back with empty pots. Asked how long, he said 5 min. Aren't you suppose to make them when the pasta is half way empty or when you have somewhat a full house? Well work on your management please."}
{"text":"I viviste this restaurant with my family like I usually do. While I was droning my soup I started feeling something in my throat. It got pretty bad I had to go to the restroom and regurgitate everything and I discovered a piece of plastic had been stuck in my throat. I notified management and they completely blew me off. Not even an apology. Terrible customer service"}
{"text":"The lonely star was for the smiling greeter/cashier. All else was sub- par! garbage everywhere and nobody seen cleaning anything the whole 40 minutes we were there. the food bar was a disappointment as well. dry, paper thin crust with a minimal smattering of any topping. salad- wilted with slimy edges. drinks fountain area  a mess. the floor in front of it was thick with sticky grime. we only stayed so our child could play a few games....never to return. ever. never...."}
{"text":"Cant beat this for all you can eat pizza buffet. And only FIVE $$$. best deal around! The staff at this location are friendly and professional. Great pizza. Great salad. Love the mac and cheese pizza. 2 large pizzas at 5.99 apiece. Very happy with this restaurant. Spent 40 $ on a buffet for 2 people the other day and hated it! Cicis pizza is a must!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how these people stay open, the food was so cheap and so much... We really liked the pizzas and the salads, the dessert was mostly pizza dough with sugar .  other that that everything else was good."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PIZZA! I thought we might have caught it on a bad day so we gave it a second try. Don't waste your money here. It is one of the WORST pizzas I've ever had in my life. They are consistent though.... consistently BAD. I could name at least 5 other places with great pizza and that would still be considered cheap. So everyone on here saying \"good for the price\" or \"what do you expect for how cheap it is\" are truly not informed when it comes to pizza in vegas."}
{"text":"Came here with my family one day for dinner. The price of the buffet is cheap and you can even get them to make you your own pizza! That was a plus.  When I came in, I was greeted by the staff. The politeness of the staff is the real reason why I'm giving such a good review. The pizza is okay. You get what you pay for. But the cinnamon rolls are flipping delicious."}
{"text":"Disgusting place! We've seen the commercials so many times but this was the nearest one to us so on our ride home from Chicago we decided to finally knock this off our list of places.   This location was DIRTY! The floors were absolutely disgusting with food everywhere and if not they were soaked with some thick non water substance we both gave up trying to figure out what it was. We assume spoiled milk since that is what the building smelled like.   The food was incredibly average. The pasta sauces had no flavor, neither did the pizza. The best was the Mac and cheese pizza and the white pizza was ok. The dessert was ok too but nothing special. I decided to use the bathroom before we headed back on the 140 miles we had left and I believe I would have been better whipping my junk out on the highway and playing chicken with my rod versus a speeding car.   I do not know if all CiCis Pizza are like this but pretty much certain we will not go and find out. If you are in Buffalo, visit Toni Pepperonis and see a real pizza buffet with cleanliness and flavor. Even for $8 each this was overpriced."}
{"text":"Awful experience. We used to come to this CiCi's all the time and it was never a 4 star restaurant, but it seemed to be managed decently and was semi-clean. Something has changed! We just left and it was so disgustingly dirty, I couldn't bring myself to finish my food.  The bathroom was not just dirty, it was so gross I started dry heaving inside of it.  Poop on the walls, on the soap dispenser.  Then, it smelled like months and months of body odor. It was clear it had not been cleaned in months and months.  Made me wonder what the kitchen lookes like.  Don't ever go here! Used to be okay but something changed."}
{"text":"Horrible \"fresh \" pizza. No a.c., they should close til it is fixed or aleast have fans for the consumers. Lobby was very dirty, didn't see any employees  bus the whole time I was there aleast 45 minutes And it wasn't very busy in there. Very bad experience  and would not recommend."}
{"text":"What a good value! A small salad then Hot fresh stuffed crust pizza, meat lovers etc. I always special order a flat crust with bacon, sausage, pineapple and extra cheese :)) Warm gooey cinnamon rolls and brownie for desert. Free wifi is nice. Friendly staff and clean place."}
{"text":"My friend and I have frequented this buffet-style pizza place many times in the past. The staff are friendly, the pizza is made to order- hot and fresh- plus they have salad, pasta, cinnamon buns and brownies. You can eat a meal with a drink for under $7.00. And you can go back for seconds til you are ready to burst! It is sometimes noisy since it's a popular place for families with young children. They have a game room for the kids and t.v.as well. It's not fancy- just a good meal for an amazing price. I don't think they have delivery- but you can order carry out."}
{"text":"Families STAY AWAY from this locatioon! The pushover management for the evening of october the 29th allowed a customer that was removing his shoes and smelling his socks, just before going (without washing his hands) to get more pizza. Then well loudly talking on speaker phone, (calling a child with downs stupid, our 11 month of child undisciplined, and further unnecessary comments) he began taking pictures of families and children. Quite honestly this clearly homo sexual lone man boisterously talking on the phone, disturbing all patrons (2-3 families left before ours) seemed to be in cahoots with management to keep customers moving out the door. Even after complaining to management about the odd behavior and unsanitary exposure to some disgusting feet, nothing was done. All he did was notify this lone man that customers were complaining...almost as if they are friends.  *****LUCKILY all our pizzas were custom orders thankfully, but CHEESE LOVERS BEWARE YOUR FRESH SLICES MAY HAVE TOE JAM HERE!*****  **!! Our 9 family members will never attend this cicis with the current evening management!! **"}
{"text":"We went to Cicis on Gilbert Rd in Mesa yesterday. Manager was very,very rude! I went in there with my friend who happens to be Africian American. They manager and his staff watched us like a hawk! Evidently they thought we were going to steal something.When I asked the manager for a pizza made to my liking he informed me there was one pizza to a table. I had only asked for one. Don't feel he needed to tell me that.  Pizza was cold for the most part,  bread sticks were never changed the whole time we were there.  Upon leaving, the manager and his staff did not tell us thanks for coming, which is their policy, and  they told everyone that left before us thanks for coming. We have never been treated that rudely, therefore we will not be going back, and will tell all our friends and associates to aviod that Cicis."}
{"text":"Ok...5.55 for the buffet was a decent price but keeping no pizza on it is not even worth the 5.55. At one point there was about 5 pieces on the bar...ridiculous! This is the worst I have ever seen it 7/12/14"}
{"text":"Don't eat anything that didn't JUST come out of the oven. The pizza on the counter is truly horrible, but right out of the oven is fair to middlin."}
{"text":"Pretty cut and dry formula. All you can eat pizza, a little pasta and I think I saw salad,but seriously? Salad? You can't beat the price, $8.15 including a drink. I would like to have seen a few more choices of specialty pizzas, but they kept them coming and also were good about clearing the used plates. I'm sure their desert \"pizzas\" aren't too healthy, but they tasted great!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I know buffets all have their downfalls, but this place absolutely takes the cake.    Every table we attempted to sit at was sticky, dirty, or both. The floor near the fountain drink dispenser had ice everywhere & nobody bothered to clean it up as though it wasn't dangerous in any way. There was a worker walking around with a cart & clearing off plates. That cart looked like it was full of diseases & smelled like roadkill left under the hot sun. Also, there is nothing more appetizing than seeing boogers stuck to the window that you're sitting next to.    The food is mediocre at best. The bathroom gave me the need to shower for twice as long as I normally do, & my iron stomach finally found its kryptonite."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the price, and it's better than your average budget pizza. I'd go here over Little Caesars."}
{"text":"The price is phenomenal! The taste is good if you're lucky to get a fresh enough pizza, otherwise I would suggest ordering something special so they have to make it right then and there. Overall $5 for all you can eat is not bad."}
{"text":"This is the WORST and most DISGUSTING Cici's we have ever been to (have been to 3 in Fl). Limited selection on pizza, the pizza that was out was cold and tasted old, the soda machine was flat, the whole place when you walk in smelt sour and they only had one dessert pizza which was brownies that looked like they kept getting knocked over by customers but thrown back up onto plate by employees. I know it's an inexpensive place but you can at least clean it. We will never be back and this one location puts a bad name on the rest of the establishments!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in Harrisburg, and had our first Cici's experience while in N.C. I'm not a huge fan of pizza, but I was impressed with the offerings at this Cici's. The place was packed with families, and lots of kids, but the workers seemed to handle everything well. The pizzas were constantly replenished, and hot. The small salad bar was kept neat, despite constant traffic flow. I didn't try the Buffalo chicken pizza, but heard it was a pretty good tasting concoction. The chicken noodle soup wasn't too bad, except the poor noodles were well past the noodle phase, and closer to mush.  Typical of what you'd want at a pizza buffet, pasta, pizzas, salad, and soup. The desserts (brownies?) looked okay, and our order of chicken wings pleased everyone at our large table. I'm assuming it was the manager that was standing in the dining area, saying hello to customers, that made for friendly service."}
{"text":"Health inspection reports for this location:  31 - Cici's Pizza, Avon Cici's Pizza, 36050 Detroit Road, had 31 food inspection violations during the inspection year from March 1, 2016, through Feb. 28, 2017, according to Ohio Department of Health records.

Oh, and I saw a worker there names Mary wipe her nose with her hand and continue working with food without washing it, then they didn't fire her when they were told about it.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Always a treat to come into a family friendly restaurant.  The pizza being buffet style is always hot and fresh, and the staff is always friendly and helpful! We are here at least once a week!! Specialty pizzas like mac n cheese, spinach alfredo,  all available for me being a vegetarian is spectacular.  They also have large party style tables set up in back and an arcade for the kids!!!"}
{"text":"We'll, I've eaten here multiple times in the past, since this is the only one in the area, mixed results. The food quality us good on some days and not so good on there. The line servers and managers are hit and miss as well when it comes to cordiality and customer response.  Typically I don't write a review unless service or food is exceptional or exceptionally bad. On this occasion, I was taken aback by the language used by a line person, the manager and an off work person just hanging around the ovens hitting on one of the young ladies. They were dropping the f-bomb pretty frequently. Now, this word is so commonly used today by everyone that normally it wouldn't have bothered me. But this place has lots of families and children and their language was not appreciated. Maybe it was because they thought no one could overhear them or whatever but it was loud enough for me and a coworker, sitting at the wall under the TV, could plainly hear. So could the children.  I don't think my comments to the manager on duty were taken very well!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best pizza in town, this is not the place. But if you are looking for a pizza buffet that is priced well, this is it. Pizza isn't bad - has lots of varieties including several dessert pizzas that are fabulous. Also includes salad bar and some pasta. Lots of families so if you want peace and quiet, not the place. But a great place to bring the kids, a soccer team, etc for a fun meal."}
{"text":"Price is great. The buffet was fresh and you can request your own pizza. The salad bar has improved and def a great place to take the kids!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today and the staff was very welcoming and friendly during our whole time there. The food on the buffet was fresh and filled the bill for what we were looking for. I'm not sure what more anyone would expect from a chain like this."}
{"text":"First time coming here and decided to order a pizza to go. I had waited 30 minutes before i became fed up and decided to ask where my pizza was. They ended up putting my pizza in the buffet and leaving me to waste my time. I got a refund but was so close to blowing up on them for their negligence since they saw me impatiently waiting around the counter with out checking on me."}
{"text":"Well, what can you expect for the $5 buffet right?   I like the buffalo chicken pizza and the ham and cheese.. bacon salad was Ok, Italian not so great!   Desserts... I like the bavarian cream and cinnamon rolls were OK ... service sucks... cashiers are mostly teenagers with an attitude like \"whatever\"  Pasta..was bland!  straight out of a jar.  So, I would go back just because who doesn't enjoy lots of bread and salad?  the kids do!   ha ha"}
{"text":"What a joy! My friend and I were travelling across the states and we had a groupon for this place and were pleasantly surprised. Great service, delicious food and good atmosphere. Definitely suggest this place to anyone who needs a good meal for a really decent price!"}
{"text":"Awful!!! I remember when Cici's used to be a great place to eat at. But boy it has gone down hill. Food out of a dumpster would have been better. Oh and customer service absolutely sucked! Who ever owns this place should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"half their pizza was cold, no longer do they toss half a pie away if its been sitting there too long.  in an effort to try to please everyone, they try and make all these specialty pizzas, but have no room for any of the classics.  their serving utensils are beyond gross, completely covered in a days worth of icing on handles and spatula. you try to get a slice and it pushes the pizza off of the tray and onto the unclean back counter.  the floors are greasy and slippery, but instead of cleaning it they put out wet floor signs, don't think those will protect them from someone slipping and falling.  when we paid we were told to sit anywhere except for the west side of the restaurant as it was reserved, not a problem until we noticed that all other available tables were covered with dishes, glasses, and were not clean.  no greeting on our way in or way out. the cash register never seems to work as it shows the customer garbled characters so you never know what you are getting charged for.  the pizza was sub par, flavorless, including all their new specialty.  if your looking for a buffet to eat at, go elsewhere, spend a couple bucks more, there are still restaurants out there that take pride in their establishment!"}
{"text":"Just seen two different employees put old pizza from under countertop back out for customers to eat. They dont want to put fresh pizza out."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and helpful and the resteraunt was clean. The food was ok, but what can you expect from a $4 buffett?"}
{"text":"The best word to describe CiCis is mediocre. The tomatoes sauce they use lacks Italian spices and the pasta is usually mushy and overcooked. The salad bar has been slightly improved with more veggies hurray. With a little imagination and a few spices this place could be greatly improved. This is pizza for people with six little kids and no idea what good Italian food is. This is corporate UNINSPIRED food."}
{"text":"I don't expect the food to be the greatest. You get what you pay for.  Staff is really friendly.  I would have given at least 3 stars but before we left had seen the manager heading back into the kitchen picking his teeth and wipe his nose with his hands.  He then went behind the counter and grabed a paper towel.   He Didnt even wash his hands before touching the food. ( I guess I should say that right where he grabbed the paper towel is a sink).  He then  used the paper towel to wipe his nose while moving food around. Come on how hard is it to go into the restroom or step out  of sight of the customers.   I am completely disgusted and will never eat there again.  If you can witness that in plain sight what can't tou see going on?"}
{"text":"Good Food, Nice People, Friendly , I like the salads. Fair Price, Comical Gameroom, Always made a vegetarian Pizza Custom Ordered without black olives upon request. I support the Vegetarian Vegan section of this restraunt, and of course, all the Cold Ice Water that I can drink. If people ever go away hungry from this place, its their own fault, lol. Have a great day everyone."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would... The price should go down to 3 dollars per person... There are homeless people loitering outside of the place. Mexican families with 12 kids letting them run free. The tables are disgusting, the chairs have crust on them, the walls have dings in them and the cooks are wiping the sweat off of their faces with the hands then making my food with contaminated hands! I am never EVERRR coming back again. DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"Very very bad place to visit They need better customer service  It doesn't surprise me the owner Mike whom I talked to on the phone is very poor at customer service too   As if u want bad service go to Cici's Pizza  And thanks for reading  More to come Mike!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best..... the Manger there is so kind and nice... It's a very friendly place, and the food taste great."}
{"text":"2 stars for the price, 0 stars for how your stomach will pay you back later...new underwear in sight..."}
{"text":"I came here with for a Customer Appreciation Month deal, but the quality of the pizzas and lack of toppings is fairly lackluster. It's definitely filling as a buffet, but otherwise I would like to see more toppings on the pizzas."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible place, I ordered wings that were supposed to come out in 10 minutes, I noticed they brought the wings out to another customer n we then asked how long for ours they said 18min so then we look at the employee came out and tough the wings from the other people the wings where support to be ours so then one employee come to us not apologizing n tells us the wings r under cooked there almost done all the works even the manager were laughing that the situation  instead of saying sorry to us... Never ever will we eat there"}
{"text":"To be clear, after 7 mos of no reponse, it is clear that CiCis is not 8. the business of. a ring about customers or making food is a safe environment.  Such  disgrace to the food industry. DON'T GO HERE.  Let me tell you of a great experience!  MOD Pizza.  WOW - Great!  Made to order - they don't tell you no or create stupid rules.  Based on about 3 visits since leaving the CiCi's review - OUTSTANDING food.  Take a detour enroute and hit a MOD Pizza.  Cheaper for my family of 5 and we did not get sick from old food.  In fact - freshly made in front of you.  Made \"Subway\" style to order and everything is included in the price.  AMAZING!  Management that gets it and hires good help unlike CiCi's.  The CiCi's story worsens - 10 days after the fact and an email to corporate - NOTHING!  That's right, crickets.  Apparently corporate does not care about customers and keeping people healthy.  These guys have really fallen.  Do yourself a favor - AVOID THIS TERRIBLE PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!"}
{"text":"Below average for cici's. Table area is OK. I go there 3 times a month. It is cheap and filling. Game room is gross as kids are eating and playing. Best thing about this place is large group tables for teams. Worst is A) never any deep dish. B) county health code is lowest in the area."}
{"text":"Love CiCi's for the family. Great, clean restaurant. We came in at 8:54 pm and realized they closed at 9:00. There was 18 of us and the staff said if we wanted to stay, they would make another pizza of each one out on the buffet for us. They were so accommodating and nice. Kept checking on us. We felt guilty about it but they made us feel completely welcome. We will eat here anytime we are in town. Great place and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I always stopped by this location since it has good  food and exellent service for the past years. I was so disappointed to see the quality has gone down mostly on customer service last night. There was a blond girl @ the front door who doesnt seem to want to be there and so was her supervisor last night. The salad bowl was empty for a long time so we ask to get a fresh one. She just opened a plastic bag and pour it. No tossing w dressing or anything. Other customers and I were surprised but we reached for the dressing bottles to make our own. They were empty. We tried to get their attn but no luck. We ate our salad dried. After eating a few slices and realized they were cold. We tried to order a few slices. The manager asked the front desk girl to take it. She acted like we bothered her. The staff are so different now. They made us very uncomfortable. The whole place has a vibe of a run down biz where the owner doesnt care anymore. Not coming back."}
{"text":"After 2 1/2 years here I finally found some edible pizza. Coming from Boston where there is a pizza place on every corner, you better be good or you'll go out of business. I swear to you that the pizza I tried from Dominos had a crust made out of saltine crackers. The first pizza I ever threw away. Now to Cicis, I had 3 slices of plain pizza that some oil on it as it should and it was pretty good. The chocolate brownie was moist and too choclity for my wife, but fine by me. The cinnamon buns were sinfull and litteraly melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for the price, $6 for adults + $1.89 for a drink. Really liked that kids 3 and under are free since my 1 year old is picky and sometimes hardly eats anything.  Wish the salad was better, its a typical mixed bagged with regular lettuce, shredded carrots and purple cabbage, plus some toppings on the side. But like I said its good for the price. The brownies were bomb and the pasta with white sauce was delicious,  the whole family liked it. Downsides were a couple homeless guys hanging out there, they weren't together. One tried sleeping at his table but the employees told him he couldn't do that and he packed up his stuff and left. The other one seemed to think this was a regular restaurant and keep gesturing for the employees to come over like they were waitresses.  Bro its a buffet, you serve yourself. Plus the restrooms had a funny smell, like soil. Overall good experience. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Worst place rude employees horrible supervisor or manager whatever she was i will never return"}
{"text":"Cici's great food great bargain. Every time we go the staff is great and on top of everything. Place is clean and fun."}

{"text":"People at my office drag me here once a week. Is the pizza awesome? No, but that isn't the point. It is a pizza buffet...a dream come true. Now if they would just add an ice cream buffet! They recently started doing a sort of apple strudel pizza for desert. Almost as good as an ice cream buffet...almost."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Salad was fresh. Pizza was good, about a 3 star rating, but the thing that pushed the rating to a 4 star was the cinnamon rolls - wow, they are good. I wish I could get them in the morning with my Starbucks."}
{"text":"0/10 would not recommend, solely on the customer service i received. I love cicis pizza but the workers that were working last night when i went are the reason i will not go back. i understand that if i didn't pay for the pizza my friend shouldn't give me some, but if i'm taking a bite from a piece he offered me, i don't appreciate being approached by a teenager and scolded for taking a bite. Not only was she rude, but they continued to gossip and stare to ensure that i didn't eat any more pizza, which made me uncomfortable. my friend also had to order a pizza they had to make specifically for him due to his allergy to diary. so the girl comes out with it and they forgot pepperonis so he kindly told her that there wasn't pepperoni. i have never seen someone make such a big deal about going back to get pepperoni and put it on the pizza. she slammed the pizza into the trash and went on to make another pizza, glaring among us and continuing to talk to her coworkers about all of us. it makes me sad that i had this kind of experience because i always used to enjoy going to cicis. i hope the employees get it together."}
{"text":"You know, I have to admit, this place has grown on me quite a bit. The biggest piece of advice I can give is, \"Don't go into the establishment expecting authentic pizza with the freshest ingredients.\" If that is what you are looking for, I suggest you search elsewhere.  HOWEVER, if you are on a budget and hungry, this place really does hit the spot. It has your average salad bar with decent selections as well as 5-8 different types of pizza to sample at a given time. There is also a dessert bar that is typically supplied with a sort of apple strudel-like pizza and brownies. The brownies are pretty darn good if I do say so myself!  And one other nice aspect about this restaurant is that you are always greeted with a warm, \"Hello, welcome to Cici's.\"   Give them a try and them try them again. You might be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"great food, went there a few years back and was blaw. thought id try it again and glad I did. they have improved 100%"}
{"text":"This place is nasty. Pizza has no flavor. I found a piece of  hair and I told the manager and he said oh just get another piece."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING !!!! My shoes stuck to the floor , the tables and chairs were maybe only dusted off and everything was just nasty. Even the windows weren't clean. Not sure if it had anything to do with the older woman that busses the place but please get new help. The food was good , the salad could be fresher it was only noon. My silverware and dishes were clean I can say that and my pizza was edible. The other reviews are not lying , skip this place is you want to dine in cleanliness."}
{"text":"Cici very rude lady. She took our orders and was not all helpful. She talked rude and felt like a racist"}
{"text":"#1  Experience page at www.cicispizza.com does Not work. #2 We stopped at Cici's today as we were in the neighborhood.  Before we ordered my husband asked for the Sr Discount and we were told there wasn't one, but we stayed anyway.  After we sat down we noticed a sign over the serving area that stated \"Sr's $3.99 Mon-Thur.  We went back to the cash register and asked why we did not get the discount and we were told it did not start until tomorrow (even though this was Mon)  About the same time the mgr came out and we asked him why we did not get the discount and he told us it was there for an Up Coming promotion that started tomorrow and it was not an advertised promotion because it was not on the window.  We were taught in business if the sign was up the special applied. He just kept telling us it started tomorrow and the sign was only for coming attractions.  There should have been either another sign on the sign saying coming soon or starts Dec 23 or it should not have been put up until tomorrow!  There were 4 different Sr patrons and we all asked and all were told the same thing.  I'm not sure, from the conversations, that any of us will return.  If you don't know it already, Sr's can be a very vocal and powerful deterrent to a business.  This was at the Mesa AZ store at 1011 S. Gilbert Rd at 12:56 on 12-22-14"}
{"text":"They close @10, right? It is currently 8pm and they have stopped serving fresh pizza. They closed down the salad bar, pasta and soup. I am utterly upset at the fact that they charged me on a five guest dine-in knowing they'll no longer have fresh food to serve. I asked for a refund but they said no because we had already grabbed our drinks. What kind of service is this??  We were hungry from our 4 hour drive back home and we get this? This is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"unfriendly staff cold hard pizza dirty tables and floors  the dinning room smelled like urine this place has gone downhill fast"}
{"text":"We had our soccer team parties here on a Saturday afternoon. The service was amazing!  There was plenty of room for everyone and the staff was working like crazy to keep the food coming, busing tables and keeping the trash cans from overflowing. I don't know how they were able to do it all but kudos to them for a job well done!  I would highly recommend this location for any large gathering of kids :)"}
{"text":"I'm literally giving this place 5 stars solely on the fact that Wiley is the most amazing and enthusiastic employee I have ever seen. He will brighten the day of anyone who steps foot into this location. Pizza is ok too"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family for lunch or dinner if you want all you can eat  pizza pizza pizza and lots of pizza + soup , salad and pasta and even desert  for a  crazy low price. The restaurant is well managed by Scott with a great team of employees that give great curteous and friendly service, so everyone go check it out."}
{"text":"Seriously we had to tell four different people that their out of C02 for the soda machine. Still nothing done. We finish our food with nothing to drink. Finally I was like forget it. Give me my damn change for these drinks back. Family of 8. Smh....Pizza was ok."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance are here right now.She put the sliced cucumbers on her salad,there is something along the lines of a kitchen cleaner or something with a strong acidy taste on them,we told them about the issue.Now about 15 minutes has gone by and they still have the cucumbers out for all to consume.I wouldn't even give 1 star"}
{"text":"I agree w Ryan F...lots of workers wiping their sweaty foreheads then handling food. I hate to say my experience was even worse. I saw with my own two eyes the \"MANAGERS ASSISTANT (tall, blond, curly hair)\" scratching his BALLS then turned around and started working with the food at the buffet!!!!! I immediately complained to GENERAL MANAGER, they apologized, then refunded the money. My first stop when I left that place was the bathroom. I couldn't stop barfing. Had to take take heavy duty meds to control the nausea. SOMEONE PLEASE CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT!!!!! I JUST MIGHT..."}
{"text":"For what it was, a $5.59 all you can eat restaurant (roughly $8 with a drink and taxes), it was acceptable. Customer base is what you would expect for a low cost restaurant of this sort. Small game room, tons of kids running around too.  Food was OK. There was a salad bar with the basics. There was pasta, pizza, and some sweets. I saw a guy literally take a whole pizza to his table.  I would have assumed that with all the pictures of dirty dishes piling up that people have posted, restaurant management would have taken more effort to minimize that. They did not. There was one guy busing tables, and he wasn't doing it quickly. There were fresh pizzas coming out every few minutes, so at least some people were working hard, but I also noticed a lot of employees often chatting with customers instead of working.  So I will probably not ever be bringing a date here, but if I'm really hungry before 9PM, I might consider going to CiCi's again."}
{"text":"One star for the price! Worst pizza I've ever had! I should have known better since it was located within a shady plaza (The .99 Store was next door). It honestly tasted like microwave pizza. Very bland, greasy and soggy crust. All the pizza looked & tasted the same. They skimped on toppings; poor quality ingredients. The salad bar was weak: 1 choice of pasta, 1 choice of soup. Felt like I was literally inside a Walmart as the people (patrons) seemed ghetto, lacking manners & etiquette. I will give them credit though on their brownies. Pretty tasty. Bathroom was eerie & stinky. I decided to hold it till I got to my room. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"The pizza fire, but don't come here. They didn't have any ranch. What is pizza without ranch. My nigga I'm hurt. And they were lacking on their pizza re-up. Like wtf. There were niggas in the back not doing shit. They out of stock on they cinnamon rolls.  I gave the a second star because the card machine wasn't working so I ate for free. I appreciate that my nigga"}
{"text":"Still going there and it's a great bargain for great pizza. If they don't have the pizza that you want out on the buffet, just ask the staff and they will cook it up for you and bring it out to the table. Overall the staff are very nice considering the stress factor that they have to deal with from some customers with poor manners. Figure on 7 bucks for lunch pizza and soda."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza but good enough for the price. What I like about it, I can customize my pizza any way I like it."}
{"text":"Decontamination chamber.  Stat!  I cave to the kids and come here about two times a year. It's always crowded and the pizza is mediocre at best, but the cinnamon rolls are passable and that's what sticks in my brain and causes some sort of experience amnesia.   Safe to say tonight's visit will not soon be forgotten. The place was packed tonight. Seemed to be a four child per family minimum. I soon realized that preschool aged children were being allowed to help themselves to the buffet.  One little guy dropped his food on the floor and then proceeded to sit there and eat it off the floor.  He was spotted by a parent/person with his parent who merely said \"you're nasty\" and then turned back around to continue eating and talking. That's the Cici's clientele folks.    The temperature inside the dining area must have been 90 degrees.  Pretty much unbearable. I heard a customer say something to the manager and his response was \"you think you're hot?  Imagine how hot we are (the workers)!\"  Oooookay!    As for the food, I can honestly say the pizza was the worst I've ever had there.  They were quick about refilling it, but they had very little variety and they all just tasted bland and awful.  They had the standard cheese, pepperoni, pep and sausage, a white veggie, a sausage and a deep dish with cheese.  It looked like the spots were labeled for the staff and these must be the standard choices now.  No Hawaaiin, taco, supreme, BBQ, buffalo or anything even slightly creative. However, the desserts were represented - even the gooey cinnamon rolls. Again, they were the ONLY highlight of the evening.  It's been a few hours and so far no food poisoning, so feeling optimistic about that.  I also feel optimistic that that was finally my last Cici's visit."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. This is a chain all you can eat cheap family place. Don't expect gourmet. The service is friendly.  It's cheap as can be. Good is ok."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and our little baby for dinner around 5pm. First time eating at Cici's , husband and I were not disappointed. We paid $15 for two buffets and one drink . Lots of choices of pizza And if they didn't have one we wanted they made it for us :). For dessert they had brownies with powdered sugar and fresh baked cinnamon rolls, yummy !!!   The restrooms are a little small, I didn't like how the changing table is right in the entrance of the bathroom. Every time someone came in they walk right past as I was changing my daughter . :/ kinda weird , wish the table was inside the large stall for a little more privacy :/. Buy other than that our visit went great ! We will be back ! :)"}
{"text":"Today we came to eat and it's closed due to no cashier or manager to charge. No sign at the door and they don't respond to knocking although they see you trying to get their attention. ATLEAST a sign of \"we are close\" will be nice. How can they not have enough people on deck or have the people THERE trained to open register. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and pizza went last night and didn't see the pizza I was hungry for so I asked about it and they made it for me fresh. Brought it out to me super hot and fresh about 15 minutes later. Salad & dessert bars were also hit by my group."}
{"text":"I just seen a girl(teenager) walk over to the dessert line, scoops up a piece of brownie & instead of putting the brownie in a plate like you supposed to NO she grabs it right off the spatula with her nasty bacterial hand!! That's disgusting & I'm sure one of the employees seen that..TERRIBLE MAINTENANCE!!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. When it only cost $5.99 don't expect gourmet.  This wasn't my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice, it was the BFs pick. He can't resist pizza. He can't even resist frozen pizza. So the big PIZZA sign got him. It's not terrible for $6. It was pretty much what you'd expect. It has a tiny salad bar, soup from a can, pasta, a bunch of so-so pizzas, dessert pizza and YUMMY cinnamon rolls.  As part of your $6 they will make you a custom pizza. I say order a custom pizza that way you know it's fresh, grab a little salad and a cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Good value.  Buffalo chicken pizza is amazing when fresh (but there's better).  And that's it. I liked it the first two times but after that it got kind of lame."}
{"text":"Imimpressed full but not hapily! We were there for 30-40 minutes before there were any clean forks out after asking twice only to be told \"theyre in the wash\". This was our 2nd and last visit to this location. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice and already it's made me realize that I'll never go back to again. The facility looks like it's breaking down, 5 people were gathered at the register talking about their schedules. The curtains are busted. The quality of the pizza is very poor... Everything I tasted was bland and felt like cardboard..."}
{"text":"First off stood there 5 before anyone came so I can pay then place is dirty as bath room at Browns game pizza was worth the money but I really am not picky it's worth the money but I will not be back here again people just as dirty as the floor damm sitting here and people just drop food all over I would not tell anyone to come here"}
{"text":"I live in California I'm not finding any locations near me. But there are always commercials on tv. I hope you open a location in Roseville ,ca or Sacramento you would do great out here. It's sad seeing the commercial and closet Cicis would be a 10hour or more drive."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and so far I've enjoyed the service and cleanliness. Wiley in particular is always helpful and smiling. I've seen him open doors for tons of people and greet everyone coming in. Honestly I enjoy coming here just because of him. He's a hard worker and I hope he gets recognised for it."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Sunday with my kids. I had a card for a free large pizza. The kids loooved the pizza. The guy that was working the register had awesome customer service. He was wearing a light blue collared shirt. Maybe the manager?  He had excellent engagement with all customers and was very welcoming and helpful. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"15 dollars for two people food was not good salad was old piZza was cold pizza taste weird only thing good cinnamon rolls not worth ur money"}
{"text":"With 5 grand kids I have visited most cici\"s in vegas and this one is the worse. We ordered two personal pizza\"s the first one was a cici\"s classic Mac n cheese. They \"buzzed\" us three times and reach time have the pie away to someone else. The second one took another  6 minutes and want the pizza w ordered. Alfredo & chicken, nothing else. It was covered in spinach. Or order was placed back in line and 15 minutes later I got doughy crust, 6 pieces of chicken and half melted cheese. So sad. The buffet was unattended and there was no regular pizza to eat. No manager presence to be seen. So, so sad."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time now I will not because I feel unsafe there they just put a sign up stating they do not want anyone carrying a gun concealed or not does not make me feel safe in that place they've already had two police officer shot in one of their stores in this town. Does the management really think the bad guys are going to  listen to their sign that's just telling them that your customers lives do not matter because a couple of people are uneasy with people carrying guns or concealed guns on their person I guess when you do get robbed in the police to come they have to wait outside until the robbers come out I hope your lives are still there when they get there. You should rethink your policy now.  Because what you are telling  the bad guys if you come rob us you will get away with it because nobody in here is armed   you lost a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Not a bad place! It's pretty cheap so that's why I'm sticking with 3 stars. The food isn't that good but it's pretty cheap and fills you up.  Their salad is pretty darn good.  Pizza is not very good which is weird for a pizza place.  I usually eat 2 slices and stick with the other stuff.  I love the pasta and soup.  I always get the pasta and cover it with Alfredo and marinara sauce. But I HAVE to eat it with the dry chili pepper they provide (thank goodness) if they didn't have that then I would never come here. It makes it taste SO much better.  As for the soup I also HAVE to add pepper and chili pepper or I wouldn't be able to eat it. But when I do add those things the soup and pasta are SO good.  I think their desserts are WAY too sweet but I still like coming.  You can order toe own pizza which is awesome."}
{"text":"CiCi's Pizza is a true bargain. I'm not going to say that this is anywhere close to my favorite pizza, because it is far from it, but having said that it is much better than you would expect for the price. When we went the pizza was good and fresh. Even the desserts were tasty, which is rare for a buffet. If you are a really big pizza eater like me you will have a hard time finding a better value than this. I plan on visiting more!"}
{"text":"First let me just put it out there, u get what u pay for, all u can eat $5.99 and happy hour $4.99. We are from Los Angeles so we had never seen let alone eaten at a CiCi's, but we have commercials like theyre on every corner. So while we were in Vegas we thought we would give it a try. This location is in a creepy shopping center especially after dark, it was 8pm. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, we asked if we could take a look at the food bar b4 we paid, we did it looked descent. We got 4 all u can eat, 4 drinks and a side of wings. On our way to find a table we noticed under each one was dirty, we had to wipe down the seats that were full of crumbs and grease. The salad bar was laughable. The pizzas lacked flavor. Now i compare this place to Chuck E Cheese that kids will love it, pizza & an arcade, kid heaven. But at least at Chucks i can eat a good salad. The stuffed crust was the best one only because it had a lil flavor. The wings were soooo salty, the soup was ok i didnt like the giant noodles. One of my daughters really liked the pasta dish, i cant remember what it was called. I think the guy that i talked to about the restaurant was the manager, he was super nice. Would i come back, probably not, but i recommend it for parents of hungry kids."}
{"text":"they will make you any type of pizza you what them too. it was better then most places i,ve been to and the sweet pizza rolls where awsome.ive had better,but all the pizza you can eat.. nice"}
{"text":"Living in Orange county California and seen their commercials on TV. Went to Las Vegas to have some fun stopped in at CICI'S pizza.  Yuck. awful pizza, pasta was the same pasta for the pasta salad and the soup. And the sauce for the pasta was The same as for the pizza,the staff was friendly ,but the food was awful , I'll never go to cici's again. Yuck yucky yuck. Can't believe they're still in business."}
{"text":"This Cici's location is on lit because of Wiley!!!! he deserves a thumbs up for his great service and fun personality!!!!"}
{"text":"food ok lettuce was brown salad bar very limited  pizza selection limited desert limited but only 6.95"}
{"text":"Five stars for take out orders. Brownies & cinnamon rolls. Quick and easily purchased."}
{"text":"Food is good not great , but what do you expect for cheap."}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok. The staff seemed nice but were all young didn't seem like any manager was there keeping them in check. They were on their phones, playing around, hanging out all while literally half the tables in the building were covered in dirty dishes. The floor was covered in trash from one side to the other. The bathroom was like a shady has station bathroom smelled nice but looked disgusting. You need someone on duty at all times to keep this place in check I would be embarrassed if I owned this location and walked in and saw it the way customers see it. We were there for over an hour, not one dirty table was bussed. The one table we found that had no dishes had ripped up booths . a few fresh pizzas came out not all that I've seen at better locations."}
{"text":"This place is great. Salad bar, pizza bar plus desserts. You can order any kind of pizza you want. There's a mini arcade and drinks. The best part? Super affordable. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was not even $7!! Definitely worth it if you want all you can eat pizza and salad!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a cheap and easy dinner with the kids. Service is awesome at this location. They have one gentleman working here who is super sweet (I've discovered from reviews prior to mine that his name is Wiley, awesome job Wiley!). He walks the whole location cleaning and talking/singing to everyone, even pulls out chairs for the ladies. He's wonderful and my kids adore him. This spot is CHEAP and good. For our family of 5 (2 of which are free) we usually pay under $30 and that includes unlimited fountain drinks and we always order 10 wings. Not bad at all considering my picky kids will leave stuffed and ready for bed. I love their thin crust spinach pizza as well as the buffalo chicken pizza. Pizza is always hot and fresh, and you can ask them to make any kind of custom pizza as well. Unlimited salad bar plus chicken noodle soup. They also have pasta with your choice of marinara or alfredo. I'm not a big sweets person, but my kids love the brownies and cinnamon rolls after stuffing their faces with pizza. Bring dollar bills for the arcade and your kiddos will be super happy."}
{"text":"I went here last month when it was $3.99 for their anniversary. A drink cup was $1.79. Most of the pizza tasted like the 99¢ frozen pizza you get at the grocery store. Had about 8 slices, a small plate of salad, and some of there cinnamon rolls and brownies.   If not for the excellent customer service, I would have given them only 1 star. I wanted to try the mac & cheese pizza after reading some of the reviews here and I didn't see any. I asked the manager and he asked me how many slices I wanted, gave me an orange cone and said he wold bring it to me when it came out of the oven."}
{"text":"This place was dirty and had an awful smell. Will never come back. The manager did give me a refund back for one of us.  Update, I was not given a refund. I was charged twice. So now a $15 meal has become $36 meal. I filed a complaint online and a man called me saying he was the owner. To get my refund for both charged I need to drive back to location. Stupid."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a long time and when we first started coming the food was fresh and amazing this staff was awesome but things of been going downhill for staff is not as friendly the pizza it's on the burnt side, and the restaurant is not as clean as it's always been. I'm hoping this is only temporary and that things get back to the way they were"}
{"text":"Food was not all that great! We were eating right beside the line and noticed the owner and manager of the store stuffing pizza to go in the hot bag over a trash can. Not so sanitary but why the five stars? Only reason why we left happy and satisfied was because of WILEY. That guy is nothing but an energetic, kind, hard working and respectful person. He never sat down once while we were eating. He cleaned the tables, welcomed guests, held the door open for guests entering and exiting, restocked the drink machine, held chairs for people sitting down, checked every table to make sure everything and everyone was ok and satisfied and the list goes. If it wasn't for WILEY, we would have left disappointed. WILEY you are the Man, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Not too many people left in the world like this guy right here."}
{"text":"A Mecca for the morbidly obese!  Whatever it is they are putting out on those warming tables, I'm not sure that you should call it pizza!"}
{"text":"I came here to try the Adult Buffet which was $6 per person and it comes with Salad, Soup, Pasta, Pizza, and Dessert.  I'm a fan of the price for a decent range of food, but not a fan of the basic-ness of the quality of food. I've had better pizza, and was hoping for more than just one kind of soup and two kinds of pasta.   I think this place was alright, they were clean and their workers were nice, cleaned up the plates that we were done with. They also had a small arcade gaming area towards the back.  A lot of people were there at the time, so I guess they were fans of CiCi's as well. For me, I just went in because I Was super hungry and wanted something cheap and was craving pizza so it's a satisfactory place to go to when you want a quick place to get your food and grind on it. Haha, otherwise, I would go to a higher maintenance pizza place."}
{"text":"Well first time here and not very pleased . Went to go get something to drink and the machine is broken for dr.pepper, the coke sticks and the soda comes out really slow like they don't clean the machine. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned on the sides of it in many months. The straws have half wrapped ones and wrapped ones in it. Not very sanitary. The pizza looks good, but not very fresh. Salad was frozen and not very fresh looking . I might give this place another shot, but not likely."}
{"text":"this place is a disaster! I normally go to the round table pizza buffet but my kids bugged me to try cici's. I don't know if all cici's pizza are like this one but my son told me this one was very sad and pathetic compared to the one in Henderson. first off the salad is disgusting. I never knew you could mess up salad till I ate here. the dressing is awful! the quality of the salad items are low grade. The choices are very small. The pizza was mediocre. it cant even compare to round table. round table is $2 more but they have a return stamp card which gives you a free buffet for every 5 you purchase. not to mention they will make any pizza you ask for on their menu and put it up on the line within 10 mins. this place only offers a limited pizza menu. they don't even offer their featured pizzas. I am seriously annoyed that this place had 5 people working and a manager. we got there at 11am and there was a sign in the desert area for the apple/Bavarian pizza but there was nothing there. tons of cinnamon which is mostly bread with hardly any cinnamon sauce. everything was out except for the desert that was missing. around 11:15 my son asked if they were gonna put any out. they said they were working on it. 11:30 I ask and they said they are putting it in the oven. 11:45 my husband goes up there and they are just getting it into the oven. 12:00pm they say \"its in the oven now.\" 12:15 pm it finally came out. pretty pathetic for 5 employees and a manager to handle 9 customers. seems like they are putting too much money in staff and need to put more money into quality. NEVER AGAIN. ROUND TABLE has me permanently when it comes to pizza buffets. oh and the pics look nothing like what they really offer. those pics are an over exaggeration of what their food really looks like."}
{"text":"We were on a trip to Cleveland, when we stumbled upon this Cici's pizza. We had seen the commercials, we just had never found one.  This was the most delicious pizza I have ever tasted. They had so many choices. If you have one of each, you would be stuffed for hours. They also had a choice of salads, pasta, bread sticks and deserts (the cinnamon rolls are really good).   In particular I loved their buffalo chicken pizza, their bbq chicken pizza and all their deep dish pizza. The taco salad pizza was good but not great. I am still not sure how I feel about lettuce on my pizza. But the flavor was there.   Recently I found out that there is one in Gardena, CA. I still have yet to drive out there and try it."}
{"text":"No sugar for tea no lids for cups and buffet  is empty.... Not busy so no excuse.... Staff is nice but young"}
{"text":"Sunday March 4, 2018 7pm. No salad. We were told a manager was bringing salad. No ice, no fruit punch, and coke out of a 2 liter bottle. Some customers are helping themselves to the 2 liter. No brownies. Manager finally dropped off salad then disappeared. Sad sad sad."}
{"text":"Great price of $5.99 all you can eat pizza,pasta and salad. Employees are really friendly with the customers and more helpful than most high dollar restaurants. Your in and out and full for cheap. What's not to love."}
{"text":"Just awful.. First off a manger who personally insulted the way I raise my kids when we were there, dirty tables, a lack of any hospitality. They need to consider hiring a manger who wasn't a high school drop out. What a incompetent guy and the sole reason this place is being ruined."}
{"text":"Went to cicis this past weekend and I  will no longer visit this particular location.Restrooms were nasty,the employees used to be outgoing and friendly now they act like rehearsed robots. Atmosphere has changed so much in the past month or so.The food was ok but not plentiful. I was a so pleased with my past visits but no longer now.Good bye Cicis at Ridgepark"}
{"text":"Pros - great and friendly service, and well worth the price. Custom pizza made fresh to order. Soup is good, salad is to the point and pasta is decent. Staff and manager are all very personable.   Cons- pizza is a bit bland and needs help , but not bad at all."}
{"text":"Was driving by and we decided to stop and give it a try. First of all the customer service is horrible seems like the employees hate to be bothered. I asked for a special order pizza and they looked at me like I was speaking a different language. I ordered a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza. When it was ready no one would acknowledge me to give us my pizza. The pizza literally had one pepperoni and one jalapeno per slice if that.  The only employees that are great are the ones that are working the dinning room. Needless to say will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had to chime in with Bob. This place has gone down hill so fast and it used to be a nice place. Absolutely gross. When we saw the health department report (the article featured the worst of the worst in Lorain county) This location was among the WORST.   One girl (no name tags...) has unkempt hair and it's always in a huge messy bun. I've seen homeless people's hair in better shape. This is a serious concern because she's making food and her hair is everywhere. Nothing covering it. She has blondish brown hair.   The food is often burnt or over cooked. Brownies are always undercooked.    It used to be that dishes were cleared during your visit now it's a rare thing for them to come by to pick up the dishes.    Putting pizza plates in their mop/cleaning sink is seriously SICK."}
{"text":"We love CiCis! We were so excited to see that Wiley had transferred from the Tropicana location. He sure is the best with service and welcoming everyone. Also, this location is always clean, staff is fantastic, and best of all our kids love to go. Win win for us since it's affordable and good!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like these cheap pizza buffets but this one was not to bad.I started with a salad and then had a bowl of chicken soup the soup was two star but the salad made three.Then it was on to the pasta and sauce not much taste there but the garlic bread was very good.Next in line was the pizza,well it was cheap pizza but there was lots of different ones to choose from and they were not to bad' after trying about ten different pizza's it was on to the sweets.they had an apple crumble pizza and cinnamon rolls that were good i also had a brownie that was way down there on the star count but still edible. I left there quite full and for 3.99 it was well worth it."}
{"text":"They ran out of ham, Mac and cheese and Alfredo sauce, Manager has no customer service skills. Salad bar was sad had no lettuce or stuff to go with it and no-one bussing tables.  Horrible place!"}
{"text":"Every time I come, the manager and assistant manager are so, so nice. The owner is always welcoming too. I like how much Cici's  does for schools too.  The pizza is good and if they don't have what you want, they can make it for you :-). They always do it with a smile too!"}
{"text":"I've had better experiences with delivery.  The company I work for has ordered Cici's 2+ times for work parties and we've had every kind of pizza, salad, dessert, wing.  I never had the wings while eating AT Cici's, but I had them when they were delivered and they were delicious. Seriously, this place is so affordable and the best discovery was the CHEESE AND SPINACH pizza. Holy hell, I creamed myself. And had like 5 pieces. And then some...  Their dressing is great. The pasta was good.  The desserts are too much after everything else, if you ask me.  And actually...I kind of think I want to drive there tonight, although it's 30 minutes from my house (5 minutes from work).  Around $5 for all you can eat...? Why not?"}
{"text":"Have had repeated problems at this location. Employees park their BICYCLES in the Handicapped spots and will mouth off and retaliate if you complain.While we ate there, our table was never cleared. We used to ask for a specific pizza and get it, now they make a SMALL one if your lucky and they feel like it.Used to have a great selection, now you have to eat whats up there and THEN they will make more.Their ads claim NEW recipes, however it tastes like cardboard now, the iced tea is usually run out and you have to ask for them to brew more...another waste of time.In Las Vegas we have a MASSIVE amount of choices for dining, we now drive right past this place for better meals. We are interested in saving SOME money...but we want to ENJOY our meal. Having to put up with this, along with the parking bullcrap, the BLASTING TV, food on the carpets and the staffs negative attitude...NO THANKS."}
{"text":"They have a great rewards program and after signing up I received bogo adult buffet. This is my first time there and I was pleasantly surprised. It still ended up being 12$ for two people after drinks and honestly cicis, call it what it is: a six dollar buffet or 5.99 not 5 and change. Five and change would be 5 dollars plus tax. And the drinks are $2.50. Those are still great prices considering it was a buffet. They did a decent job of keeping the pizza stocked and the flavor of the pizza was good. The new stuffed crust is delicious and I love the breadsticks and salad bar. The brownies were gooey (in a good way YUM) and they were fast at picking up our old plates so just remember to tip the busses picking up your plates! I also thought it was cool they had an arcade room for the kids since there was a lot of them there."}
{"text":"The food was great for $5 and change. The employees were friendly. We were there during a pretty busy time and the place was kept clean and well stocked. I was impressed considering the price and some other reviews I had read."}
{"text":"Carbon Monoxide Leak without no warning from the Employees. When me and the Family arrived at Cici's Pizza the place was cloudy with smoke, looked and smelled like over cooked pizza. As when we was eating I started to feel kind of lite headed as I looked around I started to wonder why the employees was opening up doors in the front and back. Yet they still didn't say anything. A brave Old man yelled out to everyone in the building to get out because it a Carbon Monoxide Leak in here. Why did it have to take a non employee to let the people know about the Carbon Monoxide Leak. Why wasn't there any Carbon Monoxide detectors in Cici's Pizza building. This was reckless and dangerous for my family."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night. Not to busy probably due to the heat. Owner was walking around making sure workers were busy. Pizza was hot and quite good. All on good timers. The Apple and Bavarian desert pizza was delicious when made into a sandwich. Overall a very good experience and left with a full belly of pizza."}
{"text":"I bought a \"deal\" with Groupon for this restaurant and they make you believe this restaurant is in the Tropicana hotel. At least that's what I understood by their wording \"Tropicana location\". For me Tropicana location is the hotel, it'd be more accurate if it said Tropicana Ave location. Also the pizza is not good, they only have one pasta dish which was very plain. Even the soda was watered down a lot. So overall I had a bad experience and it made me lose a lot of time in my day looking for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I do have to say that before you read this review, I am the last person usually to like pizza from the large chains. But even bad pizza is still pretty good. I have to judge the pizza up to true pizzeria standards though. I decided to try ci ci's because I am always hearing people talk about it. Well it did not live up to the hype. The restaurant itself was not very clean, the food was sub par and honestly I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. Everytime people walk in they say \"welcome to Ci ci's\". But everytime there was a couple of workers that would have to drag out the ci ci's part and it got really annoying for me to hear every 30 seconds. As for the pizza.... they do have some interesting types of pizza. However, the pizza was very bland and tasted like cardboard. It was very obvious that they do not value good and fresh ingredients. I most likely will never go back to any ci ci's"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and it will be my last time ever in any location. The pizza buffet first off all the pizzas were hard and tasted like cardboard. A buffet is supposed to have choices right? When we got their they only had four types of pizza ....pepperoni, cheese, Hawaiian, BBQ and Mac and Cheese Pizza. These pizzas reminded me of school lunches.........Place is dirty and employees standing around and playing on their phones"}
{"text":"As we got off of the bus on Charleston Avenue, by wife saw a sign for Cici's pizza and went bat $h*+ crazy over it being here. There's only 1 where we live and she said it wasn't very good.   So here we are and for $17 we get an all you can eat pizza experience with a 16 ounce cup of all you can drink beverages from the fountain.   When you walk in, there's a salad bar when you come in and then a line of a variety of pizza which sits under hot lights. Those were  pretty decent but nothing to write home about.   You can also get a small pan pizza freshly made to order. I had a veggie pizza made which was very good, the best of the three. The half cheese pizza was kind of what I expected. Tastes like the kiddie pizza you'd get at a skating ring. The other half which had chicken cubes was disgusting, a really low quality item. Hated it after 2 bites and left the other three slices on the pan.   I'm somewhat miffed on 2 stars or 3 because the place was clean and some of the pizza was good. The low quality meat feels like a rip off, but for just 8.50 for a drink and all you can eat pizza and little desserts,it's a really good deal on the go when you want to get filled up without burning a hole through your wallet.   The folks were also really kind and satisfied your order quickly. The place suffers from a lack of enthusiasm and/or pride from staff and the lack of quality ingredients in some cases. I'd go again for a quick bite, but my expectations won't be very high."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii where there's no Cicis it was exciting coming here. The food tastes good considering how cheap it is. Little Caesars used to be my go to place for cheap pizza but Cicis now takes the crown. The spinach pizza is our favorite and the cinnamon rolls are extra tasty. I did not like the \"fudge brownies\". There's a difference between fudge and raw and these brownies were straight out the mixing bowl. The brownies couldn't hold the shape of a traditional brownie. It just fell off the serving spoon. The service is also less than mediocre. Simple orders took multiple instructions before getting a correct confirmation. If you ignore the staff stay clear of the brownies your experience should be a good one."}
{"text":"Wow this was the dirtiest pizza restaurant I've ever stepped into in my life we had to clean the table off with hand sanitizer and paper towels from the bathroom the the booster seat for the baby was so dirty my wife use paper towels and sanitizer to clean it off and it came out black one of the employees bumped into my son and almost knocked him flat didn't say a word didn't even look over and acknowledging just kept on walking this restaurant is a joke and I'll complain to the manager did give us our money back but it was a horrific experience I will never under any circumstances return to that restaurant one of the clean dishes from the buffet line already had lettuce stuck to it"}
{"text":"Not bad for Cici's and the $5.99 meal. One negative thing though is they reheat leftover pizza from the day before. I do not recommend going when they open because of this unless you order a personal pizza. Their pizza does not taste well when reheated and tbe crust is very tough.  Overall this place is pretty solid for the price."}
{"text":"* Cold Pizza * Salad bar was NASTY the food was mixed upinto each others containers * Not enough choices * Never stocked at the buffet * Bathrooms were disgusting * No straws * Plastic forks * Employees talking about customers behind their back AND making fun of them * Dirty plates  My opinion... While all the employees were nice to me and my family I will not be back for the above reasons!"}
{"text":"Daily deals throughout the week, if not you can always check Groupon. Purchased one for $9: dinner for two + drinks. This location won't reality switch the types of pizza they serve, just replace. The noodles were soaked in water so wasn't too excited to have pasta, but you still have two different sauce options: Alfredo or marinara.  Have large screen tv if you want to watch whatever is on. They also have 2 claw machines in the small arcade section. I'd recommend playing the one with the smaller crane, has a better grip to win prizes and it's 50¢ a try."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about...it wasn't really packed (went on a Sunday afternoon).  The cinnamon rolls was not done and parts of it was raw dough.   Saw a little girl (maybe around 12) scratch her \"area\" and touched the straws...that definitely did not go well with me.  High chance that I will not be returning to that particular location."}
{"text":"Cici's is a place to get cheap all you can eat pizza.  The pizza is on par with other chain pizza restaurants (better than hot n' ready's from little cesars, on par with domino's, maybe slightly under pizza hut or papa john's).  This location is great and John the manager is one of the best in the business.  He goes above and beyond what he needs to do to help the customer and make sure everything is going well.    They will make you any pizza you ask for.  Some suggestions: try the bbq pizza with added toppings (I like to get it with onions and pepperoni).  My wife likes the mac and cheese with jalapenos.  The cheese steak and cheese burger pizza are delicious as well.  All of the thin crusts are good too.  My wife says the salads are good too, similar to olive garden.    Its a good place to eat a huge amount of decent pizza for very cheap."}
{"text":"LAME!! I grew up on cicis. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love these places. But this location is the absolute worst! Old pizza, Dirty, have to beg for help. The owner/manager guy is flat out mean. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We waited a long time for anyone to notice we were there and trying to pay for the food. There was a big group of teenage boys yelling and being rude the whole time. Food was below average. You're better off ordering a pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was great, customer service was great too. Whenever I go I get treated very well, and all my requests are met. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because Every time I go, theres always either a spill thats been there for a while and the floor is then sticky, or some booths still have a bunch of plates from the previous customers. I know they only have one person cleaning up at a time, so I understand completely. Great pizza though. :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet I've been to. A waste of money for the most part. The salad bar was mediocre, the pasta bar was old noodles with extremely watery sauce.  The pizza was cold, young staff members cursing and the place was filthy. I will never spend money there again."}
{"text":"Took 11 children to Vegas on a field trip. After a long HOT day the kids were ready to grub. Went to Cici's and was greeted at the door with such a warm welcome. The gentleman was very patient as we figured out who we needed to ay for. (BTW: kids eat for $.99 Mondays with the purchase of an adult meal at only $6. In addition, 3 & under eat free!) I was disappointed because they ran out of tomatoes  for the salad and the were struggling to refill food fast after getting hit with multiple large groups. However,that create your own pizza for free is legit! Hot FRESH and makes you forget about those tomatoes. All staff was very friendly and hard working. Beware of the people hanging around trying to get a free meal."}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for here. This place doesn't survive on being the best pizza, best pasta, or salad bar. It is a quick, cheap, and easy meal if you your low on funds and have a hankering for pizza.   We eat here if we want something fast and simple. The salad has changed over the years. I remember it being premix and now it is more of a salad bar which we (my husband and I)like better. The pizzas are not bad, and the variety is pretty good. My favorites are always the macaroni pizza, and bbq pizza. It's not the best but it satisfy cravings for pizza.   This place is definitely family friendly. We always see families come in and the occasional small parties. The staff are always friendly and happy which can borderline on almost crazy ( that's not a bad thing but we have theories that the owner probably threatens them to smile lol). Tables are always cleared just in time as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place..They are so friendly upon entering the door, and they will make you ANY kind of pizza you desire.. Love how clean it is and its healthy..Their pizza's have thin crust if you want it , no crust pizza too, or you can have all the crust you want.. The toppings and kinds of pizza are amazing.. Mac n Cheese, BBQ chicken, also a pizza that taste like a Big Mac.. OMG!!! what a friendly place.. Love it..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this CiCis since they opened, they have always had a good variety of Pizzas, and willing to make what ever kind you like.  I had one issue with an employee 2 months ago, when I spoke to the Manager she took care of the issue very quickly, and there has been no problems since."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I don't really like pizza. To me its just bread with a bunch of crap on top and I feel like there are so many other types of cuisines out there waiting for me to be tried. With that being said, I'm not really very picky with my pizza and could care less whether its from Dominos or a gourmet pizza place. However, Cici's pizza really just made me realize what good pizza is and what horrible pizza is. Yes, its cheap and its a buffet. But jeez, they all tasted like cardboard smeared with pizza sauce and various toppings. I already kinda had a feeling; I mean, $3.99 for unlimited pizza? Can't be too good. But after months and months of seeing the commercials on TV, my baby sister felt like she had an urgent calling to try the place. Honestly, their only saving grace is the cinnamon rolls, which I gobbled down furiously, and I HATE CINNAMON. That's how much everything else sucked."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Cicis, I actually dread when my family wants to go so keep that in mind.    I am giving a 5 star review because something really impressed me. They had a lot of pizza and it was dinner so things were moving quickly except for an old peperoni pizza that looked like it had been sitting for a while.  What impressed me was when they threw it or and spaced it with a fresh one.  Great practice for a buffet.    Food quality is on par for the price. Service was polite.   Update: I've been to cicis 10+ times and tonight I actually liked some the pizzas! Flat vegetarian was great! Everything was hot. Fridays are best."}
{"text":"If I could rate no stars I would. Let's start as soon as we walked in the door it was absolutely freezing, very dirty, and the hand sanitizer was empty. the little girl at the counter was not very friendly and seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. We finally got through that and went to make our salads. The salad looked like it had been sitting out all day. The dressing containers were all nasty and crusty. The blue cheese you couldn't even get out cause the whole was so little. Then the pasta. The white sauce was like water, the red sauce had no taste to it at all. My husband said it tasted like they just went to restaurant depot. We ordered a pizza and they said they didn't have any pan crust so we ordered it with regular. Got some other pizzas and while we were waiting for the one we ordered they put out 4 thick crusts.... none of the pizza had any flavor. It was like eating straight dough. The cinnamon rolls were not cooked even close to enough the middle was straight dough. The apple dessert tasted completely disgusting. The busser kid came to clean our table and just stood there staring instead of asking for our plates. This place has gone way downhill in the last year. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. There were literally no clean tables to sit at. It took so long to get a table bussed that we walked to the truck, got some wipes out, and wiped the table ourselves. When i reached under the chair to pull it toward the table i feel a pile of sticky old goo. The floors are covered with food. The cashier who touches money also fills the salad bar with no gloves. The dishes were carried to the counter in a fashion that they touched the servers dirty clothes. They were cleaning above the did and knocking debris into the food. Don't know how the health department has not shut this place down yet."}
{"text":"Good and cheap choice to feed a hungry crowd but I hate to see so much waste by patrons :(  Table busers are always kind."}
{"text":"Yep, mom dragged me here. When we go out with all the sibs and their 500 kids, you have to have value for mass quantities of food. It's just that simple.  The food is crap. Absolute garbage. The same 8 ingredients are used to make 24-ish different pizzas, make up the pastas, make up the salad bar, make up the desserts. I will give them ingenuity points for the fantastic use of inventory on this one.   The thing I notice is how, and sorry to state the glaringly obvious (I just believe in calling a spade a spade), there a ton of obese people in this joint. Families of fatties. So the same crowd that stocks up on 77 cent cans of Chef Boy-r-dee, and 12 for 1 ramen specials at the supermarket are here en masse.  I did bump this rating to a 3 star based on SUPERIOR customer service. This place kicked tail on making their customers feel entertained and served. Everyone is greeted upon entry and shouted a thank you on exiting. That is cool to see for basically the K-Mart of pizza places. It would be so easy for this place to be just a cheap eats no frills eatery, but having the people in place to make it an experience was a pleasant thing to see."}
{"text":"Nothing super special about this place.The kids seems to love it.It's very family oriented.The one thing is the staff is very very friendly.The reason for the two stars is because it seemed to be short staffed.It forever to clean tables and it was extremely hot in here."}
{"text":"I had never been to or heard of Cici's before so when we came here, I was completely unaware that it was an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet. Considering the selection and quality, it was almost too good to be true! I was aware, however, that they had a macaroni and cheese pizza which I was dying to try; it definitely lived up to my expectations. I was with a group of a dozen folks and we had a blast. They even had a fun little arcade and gave us fresh pizzas for our table. Everything was delicious, including the dessert cinnamon rolls and brownies. There needs to be more Cici's closer to the Los Angeles area!"}
{"text":"Cici's is great for me. I am a student on a budget and Cici's gives my as much as I want for $5. I can't find that freedom anywhere else. The food, however is fairly low quality. I think that Cici's is a value buy but you are getting what you pay for. As for post meal issues, I have never been unsatisfied no matter how much dessert pizza I eat!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty good, you will always hear \"Hi Welcome to Cici's\" everytime you go.  In fact you might hear it so much it starts to annoy you, or, like me you think it's funny and laugh.  The pizza is pretty cheap, both in cost and quality.  It's not the best pizza ever, but is overall still pretty good.  You can get a pizza made practically any way you want it.    The cinnamon rolls are the absolute best!!  I go pretty much for those gooey, cinnamon rolls alone.  I usually get 3-4 slices of pizza, and than 1-2 plates of cinnamon rolls..that's how good they are.    All you can eat for under 6 bucks is a great deal.  Im only giving this place a 4 because the pizza isn't top of the line pizza, but worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"We love coming here. My kids are obsessed with the macaroni pizza. We live in northern Nevada and always come here when we visit. The manger today was super nice and accommodating. The bus boy was very attentive to cleaning up the tables and taking away the plates that were done. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I never been here before until a few day's ago and I must say I am impressed. Went with 2 toddlers 3 kids and 3 adults and it was under 50 bucks. If you wanted wings you would have to pay extra and that included our drinks. The pizza kept running out fast but they kept making more and each time I go up it is a different pizza. My favorite is the mac and cheese its a little weird but tasted better than it sounds. They also had a arcade room in the back for the kids to play. There pizza was not fancy but it taste alot better then chucky cheese. There brownies were kinda dried out but I love the cinnipizza/roll. I diff recommend checking this location out."}
{"text":"The most disgusting \"restaurant\" I've ever been to. Apparently there are no health inspectors in Glendale. See my photos got more info."}
{"text":"This location is not terrible, in fact, for a Cici's, I give it 4 stars.  Everyone is really friendly, they seem to have a policy of greeting customers upon entry and thanking them when they leave. Everyone working is pretty young, but they are on top of things which is nice.  The food is actually decent, compared to the UNLV location (gross). I got a personal pizza, but I also tried a couple things on the line and they weren't terrible. The personal pizza was made to order and very easy tasty.  I was inside between 630 and 730 on a Saturday, which is their busy time, but they kept the place running well. It was pretty loud because everyone brought their kids, but the location is big enough that it wasn't too obnoxious."}
{"text":"Not sure I really 'got what I paid for'...   Just moved here from Florida and the CiCi's pizza there had everything I wanted, way more offerings and higher quality ingredients.  For $7.55 I got an adult lunch buffet with a drink.   Tried two different sodas and they were both watered down, almost flat. The good thing is they give you disposable cups.  Unfortunately, the buffet contained all the same things (with different crusts). There were two pepperoni, two three cheese, a meat lovers, a buffalo chicken and a spinach and feta. I ate about 5 slices of pizza.  The salad bar looked untouched with good reason, especially given the fact that the main offering, the lettuce, was brown and wilted.   The staff was adequate.   Pay attention to those five star reviews. It seems like people are more interested in Wiley keeping his job than actually providing the rest of us with honest reviews. This place would probably have only one or two stars if it weren't for people giving high reviews for this bus boy.   My step-uncle has Fragile X syndrome, which means he suffers from a specific type of mental retardation. Wiley obviously has some type of syndrome, so it's great that he is working. Still, management needs to do a better job of working with him to ensure his 'entertainment' or 'sweet nature' (quoted from other Yelpers) is not borderline harassment.   A mother had to leave while I was there because he wouldn't stop bothering her toddler, who was obviously afraid of him. He spoke to me at length several times about huggies and pampers, twinkle twinkle little star, and more. I made the decision to leave rather than stare at the same pizzas that were there when I arrived. I was just not interested in another encounter with him...   If you really are in the mood for slightly gross pizza, and you aren't going to eat more than a whole pie, I'd recommended calling in to pick up, doing the 2 large pizza deal which is the same price as the buffet. This way you can get what you want without the 'experience' of screaming children, flat soda, lukewarm pizza, and Wiley.  Pieology. That's where you should go. $8 for a fresh made pizza with fresh, unlimited toppings. I won't be returning to any CiCi's in Nevada."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time...all five or six of us. We always order a supreme for the table but we were informed that the pizzas were now personal pizzas. We ordered five of them as they never have supremes on the line. I guess they didn't take us seriously as the pizzas were never made. After a mishap with some marinara (no fault of Cicis) and 45 minutes waiting, I asked for my money back and left the store with sauce all over me. The manager refunded the entire amount of the check so cudos to him for that, but to not take your customers request seriously is very poor business practice and they have lost a regular customer!"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. The employees are rude and we kept having to wait for pizza and soup and cinnamon rolls. I love CiCis but this particular one is awful."}
{"text":"All the pizza,  salad, and pasta you can eat for under $8.00,  has to be one of the best lunch deals in town. Of course it isn't the best pizza ever but it didn't stop me from hitting it hard. Almost reminded me of the high school pizza I ate and we all loved pizza day. Salad bar is stable and the desserts offered were a hit with everyone. I see no reason not to go back, go hungry, there's plenty."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot to meet up with co workers. Just had a one on one with Sara from BCT alarms to learn more about the business. They have about 12 different pizza selections to choose from along with a great salad bar. From the second you walk thru the door till you leave they are very professional. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"We visited Cici's after running around at Monkey Joe's (while in town visiting family). We don't go out to eat much these days, since we have a 2.5 year old in tow. However, this is a GREAT place to take a young kid. The food is already ready- no waiting! I didn't have any of the pasta, but they had several vegetarian pizzas to choose from, one being, are you ready for this, macaroni & cheese pizza! Don't judge! I actually got some for my son, but it was so good I just ate it all. They also have a big salad bar, and the best part of the whole thing is the dessert area. They have these cinnamon buns that are SO GOOD. I kept going back and back and...They are really hard to resist. No, the pizza isn't the BEST I've ever had, and the place does have alot of kids running around, but hey, it's not expensive (maybe $8 a person?), and CINNAMON ROLLS."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some pizza - right away! I had purchased a frozen pizza at the local grocery store, but decided I didn't want to wait to get that baked. So... never having been in this place, I stopped by on a Sunday around noon to check it out. I must have timed it right, because even though most of the seats were taken, there was no one in line. I had to ask the cashier to explain how it would work if I wanted just some slices. Turns out you can order as though you were going through the buffet, and you are given a to-go box - but you are limited to 2 slices of pizza, 2 breadsticks, soda and a dessert - for $5. So I gave it a try. I decided the veggie pizza was fine, and loved the soft crust. The buffalo chicken had a nice flavor, but the chicken itself was just these miniscule cubes thrown on top (well, only part of the top at that). The dessert I chose was like a danish, and was very yummy. Overall, I'd say this is a quick and easy way to get a hot pizza fix, and I would go back and probably opt for sitting down so I could get the unlimited version the next time."}
{"text":"It's Cici's...it is what it is: ok food, lots of kids. You don't go here for the quality, you go here for the quantity."}
{"text":"Hits: Alfredo pizza, Pepperoni pizza, Cheese pizza. Misses: Taco pizza, Buffalo Chicken pizza. Super hit? Fresh cinnamon buns. Awesome.  Staff: Guy manning the pizza display was awesome and attentive. You're craving Taco pizza? He puts an order in and when it comes up, he slices up the pie, plates a couple of slices for you to bring to your table before putting the rest out on the buffet.  Overall not bad at all for the price."}
{"text":"Pretty standard for a Cici's. The staff was courteous, but it almost seemed as though they may have been under-staffed during my visit. When i got there, I think there were maybe e other tables, but during my visit they picked up and it became pretty busy. There was a manager on site, a girl working the register, one more person in the kitchen and a bus boy/runner. When the larger numbers hit, you could tell.   The food was pretty good. Comparable to other locations. The bacon ranch salad, though, was not as crisp as it should have been and was pretty wilty and soft while eating.   Overall, it's a good place, they just need to work on their staffing and ensuring they check their food quality on a regular basis."}
{"text":"They have gone down hill over the years .  The pizza wasn't good and they were so behind that the buffet had no pizzas and it took them forever to put out new ones .  Definitely do not recommend ."}
{"text":"Prices are acceptable but I rather pay extra if I new the restaurant will be kept clean. 8+ of employees where standing around in kitchen all talking and only 1 was cleaning tables. Soda station was filthy, and  machine with out ice! Worst of all I had asked a person bringing out pizza if they can ask someone  to clean soda station it literally took 15 minutes for someone to clean it, I watched him \"clean it\" he put dirty silverware back where the clean spoons are where customer's grabbed and use to eat with. Hugh! Gross!! I do not recomend at all they should maintain a clean facility if they have 8+ employees in on shift. Picture is post after they \"clean soda station\""}
{"text":"Haven't been here for ages! I absolutely love the cinnamon rolls for dessert, they are so soft and chewy.   I love that you can order specialty pizza by the slices, and it takes only a few minutes to bring it to your table.   The salad bar was a little weak, they didn't fill it up until we were leaving so it was only the end of the lunch rush's supply. The pasta looked a little dry, too, so I avoided it.  I did enjoy all of the pizzas available, from the white spinach pizza, to the buffalo chicken, to the classic pepperoni or Hawaiian. Most of them were hot out of the oven and delicious, but the toppings didn't go all the way to the crust, so there was a plate of dry, uneaten crusts at our table. Hey, it's a buffet! Not too many people worry about what's left on the plates.  For the price, it was absolutely worth it. The pizza was what we came for, and it filled us up and was tasty; the cinnamon rolls and dessert pizzas were the icing on the cake! I would definitely come here again, but probably for lunch or later for dinner... coming in between was when they were filling up for the dinner rush and like I said, the salad and pastas weren't as appetizing as I would have hoped.   Random fact: the Latinos were the people wiping counters, sweeping, preparing the pizzas and busing the tables while the two white chicks literally stood around gossiping... (I'm white btw) thought this was stereotypical, but true... I went up to the counter a couple of times and the ladies wouldn't respond to me, so I walked farther down and other workers were more than happy to answer my questions or fill my order. The people who helped me were nice and polite, and both welcomed and thanked me for coming, super cool.   Recap: great prices, tasty pizza and desserts. Come for lunch or dinner, but not in between. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Well, it ain't bad, but it ain't good. Selection of the food is small, but the place is fairly nice. Big game area for the kids, my only issue was hearing the vulger hip hop music talking about being \"Mr. Right Now\" and \"hit it and quit it\"! Pretty disgusting for a family pizza place. It eventually turned into soft rock, but I had my kids with me. This ain't a night club, it's a buffet."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows me, know that two of my favorite things are buffets and pizzas. Cici's is the best of both worlds. I have had more than my fair share of pizza here and I always order a barbecue chicken pizza all to myself. They let you make special requests and will accommodate pretty much anything you might want on your pizza within reason. Nothing bad about that."}
{"text":"Food was great but as far as service,  trash.. garbage.... the manager was the only was who really care seems like kids run that place.  I hate writing shitty reviews but this one deserves one..."}
{"text":"I used to like Cici's but, as of today. I cannot recommend this location. I had a card good for one buffet + drink. The card stated it is accepted at ALL locations. In mid-transaction however, another employee. took the card and rudely told me \"We don't except these here.\" After telling her about the print on the card, she got rude and repeated herself and told me it's only accepted at one location.   I then politely asked for the manager, and she said in a tone that made me want to put her through the wall \"I am the manager.\" Not even an appology. I'm sorry, but if this is the kind of service the Cici's provides now these days...that's pathetic."}
{"text":"The five stars is for Wiley! Such a positive and friendly guy. Greets everyone coming in and out of the store, cleaning your table and making people laugh. He's just awesome!"}
{"text":"I have never had any issues. Very good pizza and they will make whatever kind you want fresh and deliver to your table. $5.99 buffet for salad, pizza, pasta, soup, and dessert is a great price. Kids 3 and under eat free as well. The manager has always ben very nice and accommodating to our needs/wants. Try the buffalo chicken pizza, its amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's face it Cici's is far from gourmet pizza. What is nice about the buffet here is the diverse array of options on the buffet at any given moment. If you like pepperoni... there is a pepperoni... if you like vegy... there is a vegy... this is definitely good value for the money."}
{"text":"This location is the best one in Vegas..great salad bar and I always loved to order my personal pizza..friendly staff-thanks Espy..you're awesome!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not fresh at all. Everything on the buffet was stale and cold . No fresh pizzas brought out during our visit. Asked for a refund and left."}
{"text":"We were traveling and didn't know the area too well. We wanted to try this place out for the first time and it was tasty. The employees were friendly and had their 'catchy' way of \"asking for more pizzas\" to be made. Fun and friendly place. Very inviting. Every time the pizza came out that a group was waiting for, the customers would cheer. Kinda Silly, but it was great. It was a good time."}
{"text":"Took family for daughter's birthday back in July. Cici's has always done a great job of serving decent pizza for an affordable price. This location is better though cause the workers there engage the guests and seem to be in a great mood. Even though it's not close we will be back."}
{"text":"We visited this location on a Saturday afternoon and it was dead. The pasta was crusty, the salad bar was a mess, and the pizza that was out was old. After being there a while new fresh pizzas came out and they were fine but this was only after someone went and complained about the nasty looking ones they had out."}
{"text":"I'm not really a pizza fan and I know what you're thinking, \"Then why are you at a AYCE pizza buffet!!!\" Lol. My husband loves pizza. We go for him. Customer service is amazing here they always ask if we have requests when we finish paying. I stick mostly to the salad or a slice or two of the buffalo chick pizza."}
{"text":"Walked in to cici's paid for our buffet and before we were even seated we noticed a rather obese man at the bar grabbing pizza with his bare hands his bare underbelly rubbing all over the bar  and his dirty clothing dragging all over the pizzas. We immediately turned around,  asked for a refund and walked out. We reported it to the management but from watching on our way out nothing was done."}
{"text":"Love this place the staff are friendly.  It was my first time at this location and couldn't see spinach pizza. So I asked if it was possible for one. They were so nice and willing to help.  Place was super clean and laid back. Love there pizza!!"}
{"text":"endless pizzas yumm! 5.99?! wow! but ghetto place :("}
{"text":"I am not expecting anything fancy, but to walk in and see just about every available table piled up with dirty plates is discouraging. They can never keep up with the amount of people coming to dine, the food choice at the \"buffet\" is pathetic. And the employees really couldn't care less. I only2w3w2w w2 came because the kids really wanted to and the kids buffet was $.99. I am so happy I paid $8 for a cup of mediocre chicken soup since there was nothing else appealing available , especially for a non-meat eater.  :("}
{"text":"They didn't have a variety of pizzas out, only about 3. The floor is filthy and has clearly not been vacuumed in ages. They wouldn't do any personal pizzas because they \"ran out of dough\"  They where mopping their floors at 7:30 pm probably in a hurry to get out, but while they are cleaning the pizza is still out? Disgusting! What if any of those chemicals splash on the pizza?"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff they greet you as you come in and also seem to be genuine about it due to the synergy of the employees it's good to see that."}
{"text":"On god this shit assssss not gunna lie 7/11 better these people take for ever to make pizza most of the time you waiting instead of eating they neeeeed more people"}
{"text":"I live in LA, this Cici's location is the closest I can possibly go.  This moment finally arrived.  I couldn't believe in myself.  After Checking out from Trumph, I drove all the way to Cici's Pizza.   I want to tell you the best thing of this place is not pizza, but the CHICKEN WINGS (you need to pay extra.  I know it's a buffet....)  I'm not going to tell you how good it is for now.    Didn't know what went wrong,  the manager came out and told us that we needed to wait 10 more minutes for the wings.  Then he handed me a free buffet card with no expiration date.  COOL!  (even though I don't know when I'm gonna use it) I went there on Sunday around 1pm.  The atmosphere was good (50% black, 50% white) Lots of kids and parents.   We arrived a bit earlier b4 them, so there were plenty of food and salads.    My short comment for this place: go in happy and hungry; get out happy and full."}
{"text":"Considering the price, the pizza is quite good with good buffet variety. However, I can't get past the music. They play horrible 80's music (80's on 8). I can't get by having to listen to the music, so I won't return. Not sure if this is a CiCis thing or this location. I asked about it and they said they have to keep it on this station at this volume."}
{"text":"This place sucks! First they overcharged us and refused to fix it. Then they didn't have any lemons. I asked if they had oil/vinegar for my salad and they said no....so if you refuse to put sour ranch or nasty Italian dressing on your lettuce then you're S.O.L. Nothing had any flavor. Iced tea was nasty and old. I guess if you like horrible service and cheap tasteless pizza, this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice little pizza buffet with a salad bar. Nothing fancy, but you'll get full."}
{"text":"So I've always really enjoyed CiCi's.  I know a lot of people think this chain is rather corny but I quite enjoy them as they aim to please.  This is one of my favorite locations. They never fail at their great welcome as you enter and their thank you or bye as you leave as a group which a lot of people probably wouldn't appreciate.  They are always and ready for any pizza order. Their pizza and salad bar is always fully stocked and best of all it's very kid friendly. Which is very nice to find these days.  Great customer service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I probably should have known better. After all, buffets, especially inexpensive ones, generally serve a lot of low quality slop using the lowest quality ingredients imaginable which is how they can still make money. With Cici's though I figured that pizza when you get right down to it is not all that expensive, especially when it's done high volume with conveyor ovens. I thought perhaps the low price was on account of economy of scale. Partially that might be true.   The pizza is terrible though. This is like 2.5 yuan tube of toothpaste bad (in the sense that you could never imagine before that standards of quality could sink that low). The cheese even has kind of an artificial taste like it's processed cheese. The pasta was supposed to have alfredo sauce, but it's been discontinued. What they had was basically watered down pizza sauce to pour over your macaroni.   The garlic breadsticks with cheese were quite good and I thought that the dessert pizza which is kind of an apple crisp on a pizza crust was not that bad either.   It's five bucks and with a coupon it comes with the drink included but really you're getting what you pay for. Don't be a cheapskate and fork over a bit more for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Manager was very nice, every time I'm coming she would remember me .... Can't beat the price when you eat there."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza and desserts.  Pretty standard fare for a cheap pizza buffet, but the employees were so enthusiastic that I was smiling in spite of myself.  Every time someone came in the door, there were a few shouts of \"Hi! Welcome to Cici's!\" from the staff members.  Worth your money, especially if you go during their weekday lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before going today.  Took along a pocket packet of Clorox wipes due to all the reviews stating it was a dirty place.  It's Monday and we arrive before noon.  Husband is happy to see the sign saying Monday is $5.00 adult buffet.  We were greeted nicely, nobody else in line.  Place was nearly empty and no kids anywhere.   Tomorrow might be a different story as Tuesday is .99 kids buffet.  Everything was as described by other yelpers as far as the food went.  Basic salad bar, chicken noodle soup and a variety of pizzas.  2 different types of brownies and fresh cinnamon buns.  The place is old but wasn't dirty at all.  Very huge seating areas.  I didn't visit the restroom, our visit lasted about 30 minutes.   My son and I ordered pizzas.  His never came up.  Mine was totally too well done.  Was very disappointed in the special order.   If I was to go again I wouldn't bother.  There were plenty of selections on the buffet and fresh pizzas kept coming up.  If we get hungry for pizza in the future we might visit again.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"You can literally go all the way to value town here with the lunch buffet for $5.49. I had at least 10+ pizza slices today along with pasta and salad. One of the more \"interesting\" pizza slices there was the macaroni & cheese. It tastes basically what it sounds like. =)  I found the majority of the pizza slices to be at least okay. The pasta did leave a lot to be desired though."}
{"text":"Some of the varieties of pizza taste much better then others.  However, none of them are overly great.  This location used to be much cleaner but it appears management may have changed and the service has gone downhill a bit.  I do find the cinnamon rolls to be addictively good though.  So I keep going back to get my fix."}
{"text":"WOW is all I can say. This place is a real hole in the wall. It looks promising when you walk in, but does it go down hill fast. You see people eating a stack of 3 pieces as if it was a club sandwich. They you look the other way and there is a family with two mountains of pizza crusts.   I guess you can't expect much for a $6 pizza buffet. I think it would be better if it was located in a nicer part of the town. The food was not great. I think I got sick from eating such a low quality of food. A lot of the pizzas were greasy and very random flavor combination. An example would be an alfredo pizza with jalapenos and olives. I think the cooks are just throwing stuff on premade pizzas. The only thing that was decent was the macaroni and cheese pizza. I thought it would be gross, but pizza with a bunch of macaroni and cheese and more mozzarella cheese on top is not bad.  I don't see myself ever going back, but it was an experience to say that I've been to Cici's Pizza."}
{"text":"I live in Marin County California and we get their adds on T.V so I couldn't wait to try this place when I came down to Vegas. I have been on the company web site and it looks like Cici's is slowly coming to Northern California. I can't wait because I believe something like this would thrive in up in Nor Cal. Now enough about my day dreaming here lets talk about my experience here.    Great and awesome staff of people. The employees seemed like they enjoyed being there and were extremely helpful. I was also in contact with the manager who was there and he seemed to be helpful and had a cheery attitude. Everyone was helpful.   The pizza was good, and I absolutly loved the Macaroni and Cheese Pizza. I think I ate about 3 slices of it while I was here. I also had a slice of cheese, and pesto pizza and both were good. I only came here for the pizza experience and didn't try any of their pasta's or salads. I did get to try one of Cici's famous Cinnamon  bread pizza when it was fresh out the oven and it was sooo yummy I went back for seconds. Needless to say I went to Cici's I was really hungry so I ate a my weight in pizza, but looking back I don't regret it because there isn't a Cici's where I live.    If you live in Las Vegas and are traveling to Las Vegas please check this place out. there really isn't anything like a pizza buffet and its all you can eat for a low price. Much lower than some other buffets that you will find in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It's defiantly not as good as the one we went to in Michigan but the price is pretty decent for a pizza buffet !"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the staff. CiCi's as a company needs to really work on some things.  I definitely think they need to raise their prices. That would probably get rid of some of their trashy customers who have absolutely no respect for anything or anyone else.   John (manager) and Kiki were the ones who helped me. Everyone else was just as friendly and always asked if I needed help with anything, even if they were busy. John was even helping clean, and I respected him even more because of that. Not very many managers actually work and help the employees - they usually stand around."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch and CiCis hit the spot. It was fast, ready and affordable. They had a lunch special for $3.99. Quite a deal! I enjoyed the salad bar. The pizza was ok. It was warm and had decent toppings. Nothing to write home about by just what I needed for a 10 min lunch on the way to an appointment. The staff at this location is really great!"}
{"text":"After months of watching these CiCi's commercials for pizza for under $5 a person I had to investigate for myself. I had been mislead before with the promise of cheap yet good tasting pizza (anyone remember eatza pizza)? Back when I was a kid there was one day out of the month that I looked forward to when it came to the school lunch, and that was pizza day! Sure it was nothing more than the kind that your mom bought and tossed into the microwave when she did not feel like cooking, but to you it was still pizza LOL. Now as an adult I have learned the difference between that and what real pizza is.  An all you can eat pizza buffet how can that be a bad thing right? Well in this case it can be really, really, bad trust me!! Let's start with the concept. For $4.99 you gain access to salad, pasta, and of course pizza. Except the pasta looks old and flavorless, the salad taste like it has been sitting out to long and the pizza........ well it taste horrible.   They claim to offer over 10 types of pizza yet all I saw was three pepperoni and two cheese pizzas. They did finally make a sausage pizza when someone asked for it but  with so many people there it was gone in 60 seconds (eat your heart out Nick Cage Lol) and it took about 15-20 minutes for them to put out another one! The pasta looked bad but I gave it a shot (big mistake). It tasted like someone just overcooked a box of pasta and threw in a jar of Ragu and some left over chicken and cheese.  Just so you don't think that all I plan to do is bash this place I will say that the tea was really good. But it was nestea so is it fair to give them credit for something they do not make? Sure....... humm I guess LOL. To be fair what does one really expect to get when they spend only $4.99? Good food that does not give you stomach pains the rest of the night? Pride in the products you offer? I don't even know anymore LOL.   I guess I will do what my grandma's friend used to and lower my expectations. For some this is good food at a price they can afford. But speaking as a person with taste buds I will have to say thanks but no thanks.  Good pizza for under $5.00? not here  Case closed"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with friends on Tuesday. Food was okay. Good variety of pizzas but not great. But what can you expect for $5.99 ATCE? I was looking forward to the cinnamon rolls that everyone raved about but they sucked. Not fresh at all. Really disappointed!! The mac n cheese pizza was interesting. Don't think I'd go back. But for the money, it's alright. But ordering fresh from the people behind the counter is good, fresh decent tasting pizza! Overall clean and cheap, but foods not great."}
{"text":"i always see cici commercials on tv and am instantly sold-- pizza buffet? down :]   well, i finally found a cici's in las vegas-- since ive never been to one in california. its definitely not a fancy place, but its pretty good for the price you pay. i think the lunch buffet was around four bucks a person-- and you cannot beat that! the pizza was so so, but you get what you pay for! there is definitely no real complaints here! however the only thing i wish was that they had something for dessert-- because their sugary breadstick things were not crackin. so if youre hungry and in this area give this place a try :]"}
{"text":"This was, without a doubt, the nastiest pizza I have ever had in my life, thin cardboard like crust, probably imitation cheese, hardly any toppings on the pizza, just gross and tasteless.   The only bright spot was the brownies.  Pretty hard to screw up a chocolate brownie.  And the clientele. oh my.  One old man, had to be in his 60's, had a plaid shirt with no sleeves and was unbuttoned almost to his waist.   Copious amounts of grey chest hair sticking out of his shirt, and it looked like a forrest on his upper arms....at least he looked clean, which is more than I can say for other people in here.  Someone could buy me dinner and I wouldn't go back to this F___g gross place...."}
{"text":"The pizza has improved since my last visit. The manager had a supreme pizza made for me. It was hot and very yummy. The pizza variety ran low several times but otherwise a great meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 0 star review because I would. I'm not even sure where to begin. I guess I'll start at the beginning of our visit. No one greeted us with your typical \"welcome to Cici's.\" It was mumbled when we walked up to the counter. Pizza was decent but nothing I'll crave. Some tasted old and like it had been there a while. While we were eating my husband noticed that there was a teenager that was going up frequently. After the second visit to the buffet the teenager was putting pizza right on his hand not on a plan. Disgusted by this, I went to the manager on duty and explained to him how disgusting it was. He was like ok and no apology. Well he was standing at the buffet when the same teenager went back up. The teenager waited until the manager had his back turned and did it again! I honestly couldn't stand being in there and neither could my husband. He said something to the teenager and the teenager laughed and did it anyway. I will be calling to speak with manager tomorrow. I won't be back and I'll make sure I tell everyone not to go here either."}
{"text":"If you're feeling like you have the munchies and don't want to break your wallet, this is your place. All you can eat for 5.50. They make it to your order which is tight so you can have a taco, pulled pork, chicken and mac n cheese pizza with no extra charge. They do take out and it's a bit more than a little caesars or hungry howies but better than a little lil c's. It'll fill you up but the quality is what you pay for. Ayy you'll enjoy it for the price. Oh, the staff were nice as well."}
{"text":"The price was good, but they kept running out of pizza and couldnt keep up with demand. They were friendly though just very slow. Maybe will try again another day."}
{"text":"Came here on Jan 13th 2018 with my family. The cashier rang me up for two kids, which my son is only 3 and on top of that he is very small for his age. I didn't pay any mind till she told me the total. I paid and looked at my receipt and then noticed she charged me for two kids. I kindly went to her and told her. My son is 3 isn't he free. She said yes and went to get someone to fix it. Well this lady was like, where's the child? I pointed to where we were sitting and this lady seriously went over to look at my son to make sure he was 3 and under. Smh nope I couldn't do it. Told my daughter to get her things and told her to refund my entire order. I thought that was so rude of her"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went to Cici's last Sunday around 11:30. Pizza was delicious (especially the mac & cheese one) and I was impressed by how fast they were churning out pizzas. And the guy working there (who I think was the manager) was AWESOME and very friendly. We will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. The food tasted like it's been sitting out for awhile. The mac n cheese pizza is always my favorite and it was so hard to eat... It was cold and chewy. All the other pizzas I got were old tasting and cold. There were plenty of people working and the place was not that clean."}
{"text":"We drive over 30 mins to come to this location because the one near our house is disgusting. This one the food is always fresh and the staff is so nice. Lots of seating and they keep the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Not coming back to this location! It was disgusting. Not once did I see someone come clean the tables and floors. All the booths had food all over them and under them. The food wasn't that great either it was old and stale."}
{"text":"Arrived at noon for lunch... immediately wrote in my custom flatbread pizza LOL! Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapenos.. it is NOW 20 mins later and no pizza.. my buzzer assigned buzzed and I was given chicken wings, I didn't take because I didn't order then she tried to give a mushroom flatbread... again I didn't order! Now 26 mins later I'm done and NO PIZZA.. we left! Mgr behind tried to tell me because we ALL ordered at the same time.. there was only literally a handful of people at that time. Yes it got fuller but NOT THE time we arrived.. I will NOT BE BACK their new system is worthless"}
{"text":"Place is not a good manager had bad attitude does not understand a business is built on return customers.  hair found in food blame us for putting out there, was but asking fire money back or anuthing else but blamed  us"}
{"text":"When you first walk in everybody's so excited you're there they immediately greet you with a, \"hi welcome to ____\". Their pizza selection is pretty amazing. They have it setup like aim the face when you walk by you to see all the different types of pizzas which is in my opinion, impressive because when you smell the food do you want the food, lol. Everybody was really nice I'm not sure on the pricing as I was not the one buying, however I was well pleased with the place it was clean the play area with video games for the children was immaculate. Not that great of a selection for younger kids as far as Entertainment goes, however none the less you could nearly eat off the floor, not that I recommended."}
{"text":"CiCi's is an all you can eat pizza style buffet, where the food is Three Star, \"A-OK\".  My only other comparison in this category is Pizza Hut.  And, I am not even sure if they still offer lunch buffets.  Admittedly I love salad bars (photo). Cici's is not great and somewhat basic, but it's not bad either.   A Yelp friend told me that: \"CiCi's is nothing to write home about, but for $5.00 a person through the end of March, it's a no brainer!\" I came here yesterday with a friend and we would both agree with that statement.  They put out a good spread!  There is something about their pizza cheese that has a slight taste of butter to it.  This is similar to Pizza Hut's in that regard.  I don't know if it is the actual cheese, or is it something they add after it comes out of the oven.  But it makes it's very flavorful.  I guess, if I added butter to things before serving it, I would be a better cook too. LOL  Our bill came to $14.45 including drinks. Our server and cashier Karen was very friendly and offered to help if we wanted anything else.  So, Cici's was a no brainer for us and good Three Stars faire."}
{"text":"The restrooms and the dining area smells like poop. One of the customera complained to the manager and he didnt have anyone go investigate the smell more than likely because they were an hour and a half from closing. The food quality was decent for 7$ a person but they could have filled the sauces for the pasta back up instead of leaving them to get curdled and overcooked. The soda machine needed to be restocked of syrups because the drinks were bitter. All in all, this location seems like it doesn't care about anything. Horrible. i wouldnt recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I was looking for some cheap fun quick eats and this place was good. I decided to try this place based on the reviews I read here.  The guy at the register was totally friendly and introduced himself and the rest of the staff to us. He said to ask them if we wanted anything we didn't see out there.  There's an extra charge for drinks (about $2) and a little more if you want a large take-out cup. We arrived around 9pm so the place wasn't too crowded but the food wasn't that fresh since they close at 10pm. There are 2 TV's in case you're bored (we watched Family Guy and Robot Chicken while dining) and there's a little game room in the back.  I didn't eat too much pizza since I wasn't that hungry, but I think they wouldv'e been really good if they were hot and fresh out of the oven. I didn't try the pasta.  The garlic cheese bread bites are DELICIOUS! It's soft on the inside and crusty on the outside and tasty!! I think there is mozzarella sprinkled on there. I had a whole plateful.  I will totally come again, but not when I'm expecting a fancy italian meal.. just fast, fun, cheap-ish food ($11pp)  ============ 2nd visit ================ Go when the pizza is fresh, it is FANTASTIC!! YUMMMMMM =P"}
{"text":"I'm not usually the bitter type, but I am very disappointed with the service I was given. The person at the register was on his phone when we walked in & hollered at his coworker to attend us (my mother & I). We paid & began to choose our entrées, when we noticed that all the food was dry and looked as if it had been sitting there all morning. The pizza was cold & tasteless. Definitely not worth the $15 we paid. If I could give zero stars I would. The one star goes out to the gentlemen who was courteous and happy to work. Unfortunately I did not get his name otherwise I would include it. I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Cici's Pizza on Center Ridge Rd in Rocky River OH was horrible. We were there in 2014 and they were out of pastas and sauce.  The pizza has fake cheese and oil topping that looks like real cheese. We'll never go back. Don't waste your time and money. Sad to say but Golden Coral is better."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! Was my first visit! The staffing was OMG FANTASTIC!!! I literally cant get over how friendly everyone was and very quick as well. I enjoyed my experience very much and cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This by far has to be the worst experience i have had at a pizza place. We purchased 2 adult mega buffets because they came with 5 wings and a drink amongst other stuff we purchased. We got our plates and there was no salad, no pizza , no soup or utensils out. It took about a good 7 mins before pizzas came out to simply have to wait for the 2nd round of pizzas since everyone had been waiting on some. So we finally got our pizza and 25 mins later our wings were still not out but yet the people behind us who got there after us had their wings given to them while we still waited.. At this point i am irritated and just want to leave so i got up and asked for a refund on my wings and was told by the manager our wings had been put in the over 5 mins ago. She offered us 2 free adult buffets for another visit which i declined since the food was mediocre and nothing like they advertise on tv. This place is ran by an understaffed personnel who clearly need help to keep things running smoothly. I will not be returning to cicis but i wanted to post my review to give others a heads up on what to expect."}
{"text":"They have now introduced 3 different flatbreads to the buffet and that raises this to 4 stars."}
{"text":"So I'm not even sure if this place deserves one star...it's dirty, out dated and the pizza is old. My husband and I used to go to cici's pretty frequently when we lived out of state and I'm positive we will not be returning to this one. When I got the alfredo sauce for my pasta it looked like it hadn't been touched in hours and it was strangely lumpy. Then I went to get my pizza (I fold my pizzas in half when I eat them) when I went to fold the crust it broke in three pieces. It was hard old and inedible... Hard pass. I'm a pretty shy person and didn't want to say anything or ask for a manager so I decided to just ask for a personal cheese pizza so at least I would know it would be fresh out of the oven. But I was told that they don't do personal \"cheese pizzas\" that I can only get the types of pizzas that were on the forms... Like what? I thought we could get any type of personal pizza we wanted. At least that was the way at other Cicis I've been too... Honestly just save your money and don't come here . P.s. don't eat the cinnamon rolls because they have been sitting in something gross for who knows how long..."}
{"text":"Ok, they are seriously trying hard to sell this revamp crap, don't buy it total BS. We walked in there was one person in front of us, however there was quickly a line out the door because the 2 people working the line we're taking a phone in order, I'm sorry in the middle of the dinner rush you are taking phone orders, making the people in house wait 10 minutes kids screaming every one hungry and it takes 2 people to take a phone order?? Very quickly you find out the \" WINGS\" they keep bragging about are not only not on the bar they are 3.99 extra for 5 wings, they aren't even unlimited and of you want 5 wings, buffet,and drink it's 10.95 WHAT. The salad bar is miniscule (just like the old one) and they made it so hard to get to if you are shot and the green peppers are in the back you are SOL. The \"SOUP\" is Cavatappi which seems to be the not noodle this place has ever heard of pasta salad, soup, pasta and sauce all the same noodles. Anyway the soup is water with Cavatappi, you only have one choice. Lastly the \"PIZZA\" is extremely bland. Mostly cheese and doughy, which is undercooked. Every kind I tried looked delicious, but failed badly to deliver on taste. The order you own pizza is a joke because when they are busy you will wait forever as well as desert there wasn't one cream cheese brownie the whole time I was in there and we had to wait forever to get undercooked cinnamon rolls. Best bet take your $5 and change to Little Caesars and get a large pizza you will thank me later!"}
{"text":"My family enjoys going. Pizza is always fresh and staff is always friendly. Willie always has a smile on his face and is waiting to greet you at the door. I love his energy and leave him a tip every time we go. I would like it if they came up with a different type of pizza to display. We come about 3 times a month and it seems like it's the same type of pizzas always out unless you order your custom pizza. I think it would be pretty cool to come up with different types of pizza combo to have out."}
{"text":"For the price of the food you can't really complain. Came in here after a night of having some fun in Vegas with my friends. We all enjoyed the food and we all ate tons of food for such a cheap price. The employees are very nice and it wasn't packed when we came in(around 12). It began to get packed around lunch time so practically after an hour we were there. The cinnamon buns were so delicious! All their desserts were great. The pizza was ok, for the price though you can't complain. Great place to come eat after a long night at the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"While driving through Texas last year, my wife and I stopped at a Cici's pizza place.  We'd never heard of a Cicis but went away very impressed.  It was that memory that brought me to the Phoenix locatlion on N. 75th. For a buffet, the food was very good.  I especially enjoyed the salad bar.  All kinds of pizza and if they don't have what you want then ask and they'll make one for you.  We both stuffed ourselves silly.  Staff was very friendly and helpful and asked several times if we were ok.  The problem is that 75th ave is still a long way from where we live and it takes a real reason to drive that far.  I found myself wishing that I knew some little kids that I could take there.  They'd really enjoy it. Place was very clean and modern.  Two televisons showing Latin program and latin music was constantly playing.  Neither of these items were obtrusive but does show up the fact that the guests are predominantly Spanish speaking which didn't bother us in the least. We enjoyed our trip there and would do so again if only CiCis would start another store closer to the center of town."}
{"text":"Not the best CiCi's I've ever been to. Staff was very friendly, but the food just didn't seem as good as the one from back home (Northern VA area).   It's a cheap buffet, so don't expect too much, but it's decent, cheap, unlimited pizza for those times you just want quantity over quality.   Consider this a review on the location, not CiCi's in general. Anyone who tries to compare this to a non-chain ma-n-pop pizza shop will be severely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cheap pizza, what's the worst that could happen? Very little actually.   This place has a bad reputation. People seem to think that they should get the Caesars Palace buffet for $5.99 but to be honest, this place isn't bad as long as you:  1. Order a custom pizza.  They bring it to your table and it's scorching hot and fresh.   2. Go at peak time You get everything turned over faster this way.   3. Go expecting a $6 buffet  Seriously, out your pretentious attitude away and have fun!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday because I bought a Groupon.  I've never been to a Cicis, so I didn't know what to expect.  Right as I entered I already could see a huge mess all over the lobby.  The worker in the front was polite, and did mention that they were under-staffed.  They had a very limited selection of pizza, and whenever new ones came, an entire family would devour it within seconds, so I really didn't get to try more than a couple.  They were good though.  I would give the pizza itself a 7/10.  They're slightly better than frozen pizzas you buy at the grocery store.  The rest of the experience was just bad.  The place was filthy.  The floors had pieces of pizza, lettuce, condiments, and napkins.  I almost slipped just by walking in the lobby.  The majority of the tables were empty, but still had dirty dishes and pizza on them.  I did see a worker clean up a few of them.  The fountain drinks had no ice when I arrived, and they looked dirty.  There was a mountain of ice on the drip try.  Overall, I would not recommend this place.  The pizza is okay, but considering how dirty it is in the lobby, I can only imagine how dirty it could be in the kitchen."}
{"text":"When on a budget and in a hurry, Little Caesars saves the day. I was coming from Ross and Cici's was right across so I decided to come here instead. We've been here a couple of times and actually enjoyed it but just never thought of it again. We ordered 2 large sausage and 2 pepperoni pizzas to go. There's a separate entrance for to go and dine in which is convenient. I've forgotten how much I enjoyed their pizza last time and have now started ordering from them instead of Little Caesars for quick and budget friendly dinners. It's not the best pizza, but it'll do, just call ahead so your pizza's ready when you arrive. They have nice and friendly people working here too."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. The atmosphere is somewhat friendly, but the majority of the employees only spoke Spanish or very limited English. The woman who was clearing plates would circle and circle when we had the plate we were eating off and wanted to take it as soon as the last bite was in your hand. It made for a very uncomfortable situation.  The manager told a customer it would be 20 min for cinnamon rolls then after 35 min, when asked...the other employee stated that whoever said that was wrong..it would be an additional 20-30 min for cinnamon rolls. So an hour with no cinnamon rolls. The restaurant was not very busy, so there shouldn't be a reason for the line not to be fully stocked at all times. (Less than 15 customers in the restaurant)  Another disturbing moment....the woman collecting plates came out of the back area with what looked like wet gloves and two large rolls of toilet paper. She went into the bathroom to change or add them to what was already there. I realllllly hope she changed her gloves."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday at 830 pm. The Place was busy, but we were greeted upon entering. Lots of pizza choices were available. My wife asked for a special pizza and they brought it out to us with no problem. All of the staff were pleasant and friendly. The business clean. My wife and I enjoyed our experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to eat, not anymore! I will never eat here again! First of all they don't make pizzas to order anymore (only personal pizzas) and the brownies that they just out out on the buffet were COLD! very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great for families and large groups. Also great place for quick eats for lunch or dinner  They always have a variety of pizza on the buffet but if you do not see your favorite pizza they will make it for you.  The employees are always friendly and helpful at this location."}
{"text":"Back when I was living in Cali, I would occasionally see commercials for Cici's Pizza and thought, \"this looks delicious. Wish I could go here.\"  Now that I've moved to a state that has Cici's all around town I thought, \"finally.\"  UNTIL....I came here and tried this place for myself. Perhaps I came when they were 2 hours into closing time but their pizzas are NOT fresh. Even though it came straight out of the oven, it tasted like cardboard. I was disappointed. =( And the pasta...don't even bother. Very unflavorful and their sauce didn't taste fresh either.   Even though it was about $5-6 per person (not including beverage), I WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I mean come on. What more could you ask for. This location wasn't the best which is why only the 3 stars. They didn't have as big of a buffet as others have and some of the things looked like they had been there for a bit but they started bringing fresh stuff out and it started to be okay. The staff was really friendly as well."}
{"text":"We have been to this Cici's before and never before have we witnessed what we did tonight.   We got the Cici's and had to wait for someone to come and take our money, there were no employees in site until we looked over at a table where there were 3 employees sitting, talking and joking around (a guy in red shirt who look to have a guest with him, a girl, and two in black shirts). Not one of them moved to help us and it wasn't like they were busy, there were only 15 people in the store and 2 of them were us.   Looking around the salad bar was a mess, there was food all over the place and salad dressing poured all over. There was minimal pizza out on the line, The pasta looked like it had been sitting there for hours, and the sauces looked like they had been there even longer than that. As you make your way down the line, the garlic bread wasn't cooked all the way, it was still raw. The pizza was cold and looked like it had been sitting there for a long time too. There was no deserts out at this time.   Looking around the whole room was a mess. There was food all over the floor, the tables were covered with dishes and food from the people that had left before we arrived. There was stuff under the tables. And NO ONE AROUND doing anything about it.   We choose our food and most of it was warm, but not hot. The salad dressing was cool but not cold. They finally did put out some pizza that was fresh out of the ovens and that was really good. They finally got some deserts out and it was hot and good.   We sat there looking around and about 30 mins into our meal finally someone came out to clean. It took him forever to clean the tables, not because they were that dirty, but because he was that slow. No employee stayed in the front by the register for any amount of time, each time someone came in they had to wait a while before being taken care of. Employee's were more worried about eating and drinking themselves, then they were about their paying guest.   We watch one employee take her cup, empty it in the soda fountain, then wash it out with the water from the soda fountain (several time) and then refill her drink. I didn't understand why she was using this to wash her cup, as I could see the sink from where I was sitting and she could have washed her cup in the sink and then fill it up at the fountain. Then I watch the employee in the RED shirt, who I assume was in charge, take the key and met two other guest (guys) in the game room and started playing games. All the while the other employees were no where to be found.   After a while the Red shirt finally left the game room and went back into the kitchen. The whole place is in need of a cleaning, because under every table was a mess of food and trash. We choose the one with the least.   To my surprise I saw about 20 pizzas sitting on racks that are attached to the wall. I pointed it out to my husband, who went up to the bar asked about it. The girl said that they make them ahead of time and they sit on the racks for about 20 mins and they cook them. I know that's not true, because we had already been there 45 mins too long and they only took 2 pizzas off the racks in that time. Those pizzas sit on the wall for a long time, and who knows what's in the air. Also we watched an employee take a plastic bag of salad and pour it into the bin on the salad bar.....dumping the plastic into the bin. Then we watched an employee wipe down the bar and then use the same rag to pick up the pizza pan (of course the pizza is on the edge of the pan where this rag touched) and move it and then continue to wipe the bar down and then use the same rag to move the pizza back.   We have been to this Cici's in the past, and not witnessed what we witnessed today. We will not be going back. Your employees have no business in this kind of job. We have expected the same kind of service that we have had in the past, where we were greeted when we walked in, where we were asked if there was any kind of special pizza we might like and a clean store. If I could have given NO stars I would.   I would suggest that the Owner/Manager Jack Rochelle goes to his story and clean it up. Get rid of the employees that aren't doing their job. (and that would be everyone that was on this shift today between 4 & 5:45 pm) These people do not have your interest as a priority, they are only there for the paycheck. They don't care about your customer, they only care about having a good time. They are running your store into the ground and you are going to end up with your store being just like what happened to the store in Peoria. ·"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, both times it was...   Ooookaay. Food seems very cheap n fake. Very little cheese on the pizza, had to wait for pizza and cheese bread as they ran out at buffet as staff was chatting it up and ignoring the customers who were waiting. Some customers were asking if they had any more pizza ready but staff were to bust chatting or arguing to respond. Then, they take their sweet ass time bringing the pizza from the oven over to the buffet. Pizzas were just sitting there.  Won't be back. Barros is way beter, hell even Lil Caesars beats the hell out if cicis"}
{"text":"Six bucks and you have all you can eat pizza, salad, soup and desert. Pizza not to bad at all. Brownies and cinnamon rolls are so so GOOD. Would have given a five star but the place needs a good deep cleaning and a little TLC."}
{"text":"Before noon and it is not busy. Salad bar, pizza and desert all good. Clean and the staff great. Have not been to one for a while because of rating it a 2 star. For $6.09 for the buffet it's a great fill up spot."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Cheap place to eat, and kids under 4 are free.  My daughter is 3, so I take here here a lot and she really enjoys it.  Don't waste your money on the game machines though, half of them eat your tokens."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good although the staff could work on the cleanliness of the facility.  Over all good experience."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the nice decor and colors and open feeling. Food was good and a nice selection. Ask about Senior Special. Small game room in back."}
{"text":"My kids LOVE CiCi's. I could live without it. The pizza is edible, but nothing spectacular. They do have some cool pizza's like Mac n cheese, buffalo chicken, BBQ, deep dish, and so on. There is a small salad and pasta bar, Alfredo and red sauce with some noodles. I would never order pizza to go, just because it's not that good. Usually pretty dry, flat/thin, under or overcooked, too little or too much sauce, just not constant in any way. I can honestly say my kids have never once complained about the food NOT ONCE. I will however pay $5 for my kids to fill up and play some games in the mini game room. The place isn't overly clean, and the staff isn't always the nicest, but I don't expect much at a $5 buffet. If you've got kids take them, but I suggest you , the parents, eat first! 3 stars instead of 1 only because my kids would have given it 5! Fair is fair!"}
{"text":"I can't really say much besides the food is cheap!  I'm a big fan of buffets, and this one is more like a giant cafeteria, but I don't mind.  Sometimes I just want a casual place to pig out.    They deliver too, but I've never used that service, although if they can give me macaroni pizza at home I might possibly have to try it!  It can definitely get a little crowded around dinner time.  So the noise level is quite high since everyone and their mama brings small children.  Sooooo if you really don't do crying babies, don't go here."}
{"text":"I really like this pizza joint, it's cheap delicious. It's kind of like a pizza buffet but if you would like something special they will make it for you and bring it to your table. They have a small salad bar before you head your way to your pizza."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Helpful. Food was delicious.  We were starving and appreciated the fast service."}
{"text":"cicis pizza on west Charleston has a good lunch good salad bar and very good pizza too the staff takes excellent care of their customers/Bodacious"}
{"text":"No pasta ready, water only chicken soup, burnt stuff crust. Nasty bathrooms. Sad part at 4 pm they are not real busy. Need to step up or move out folks."}
{"text":"Not clean. Floor counters employees So much diversity in pizza choices there was none. When I ask if I could order one for the table something that usually they bring out immediately - I was told it would be a 45 minute wait. Really?"}
{"text":"I have celiacs disease, and I am usually very nervous about eating at a pizza place. The owner knew exactly what to do so I wouldn't get sick. He prepared just for me a crust-less pizza and GF wings. I am so grateful. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love there pizza. Just not a place to bring the children. The only pizza I could while pregnant. ( because it's thin)"}
{"text":"Long time customer, been shitted on. No pizza and where were the god dam noddles!!!?!"}
{"text":"We've visited this location multiple times and enjoyed the food, always fresh, and they have a good verity. The cashiers and wait staff are amazing and always upbeat and helpful. The building is clean and well lit and they had good shows on the tv and decent music playing. Never an issue until this particular day we went in and the general manager was on his phone walking around the restaurant ignoring guests and not helping the staff. The general manager also ignored a mess on the floor that was clearly visible by everyone and only took action when another guest made a complaint."}
{"text":"Ask for the thick crust and they will make you a fresh deep dish pizza that is amazing.  The same dough is used on the cinnamon rolls and we were in heaven.  Service, value, and cleanliness deserve 5 stars.  Buffet selection is good but didn't see too many veggie options. I'm sure if I asked they would have though. Seniors got their drinks included."}
{"text":"There's nothing worse than being hungry and having hungry kids to arrive at your choice and being told that they are closed though the website says they close at 10:30 the sign on the door says they close at 10pm and the people inside obviously ready to go home says they close at 9:30. But you can pay full price eat whatever is left while you stand because they have already put all the chairs on the table and covered the salad bar with plastic wrap. They said it's a corporate policy, however I called all the other locations in Las Vegas and they said the dinning room closes at the posted time and about 15 minutes prior to that time the stop preparing pizza."}
{"text":"My first impression was simply \"dirty\". Place looked like it hasn't mopped for months. Tables had crumbs and grease. The drink fountain was dirty with liquid dripping and sticky. The buffet counter was also dirty with stuff on it.   I came to Cici's to get varieties of pizza. $5.99 per person. But no good at all. Came with family of 4 and we all rejected the pizzas. The mac & cheese pizza was cold and chewy, no softness of the dough. The cheddar cheese and ham pizza wasn't good at all. I never liked any of the pizza dough. The seasonings on the crust was good but didn't help at all in general. Though I really liked the cheese-stuffed deep dish pepperoni pizza, very crispy crust with cheese oozed out of it. The salad bar was horrendous. The salad was chopped up in weird uneven pieces. There were bacon bits but DID NOT taste like bacon at all. Some other toppings and plenty of dressings. If they have like 6 different types of dressing for just salad then maybe they should do better for the pizzas instead (after all the place is for pizzas, not salad). There were pastas with Alfredo sauce but didn't look appetizing. The desserts were some choco brownies and some types of cinnamon buns. Tried the cinnamon buns, tasted like cinnamon buns.   Overall was not impressed. If a person was to pay almost $6 pizza for this kind of pizzas then I recommend you order Little Caesar's instead, same thing for families."}
{"text":"Well, as someone else said, you have to judge it in it's own class. Compare to places like Chuck E cheese or Peter Piper.  The pizza is better, in my opinion than those places and I enjoyed the variety. If you don't see what you want, you can place a special order. They will even ask you how many slices you want & bring it to you to make sure you get it & it doesn't disappear by the time you go back up (for bigger parties they'll bring you the whole thing)  It isn't as loud & over stimulating as other kids pizza joints, but there are two TVs set to kids channels and a small arcade room in the back.    I did only give them 3 stars because for a place that caters to kids & families so strongly (the kids tv, the arcade, kids under 3 eat free)  they didn't offer an actual kids cup (with a lid that fits on)  So after the girl strongly encouraged me to purchase a drink for my 2 yr old, saying they had lids, I was handed a smaller sized \"for here\" restaurant cup with a \"to go\" lid that happened to somewhat fit. When she tipped the cup slightly to drink from it, it literally spilled all over her.  I went to ask for a real kids cup, but that was all they could offer me. Putting a second lid on secured it a little better, but still not great. How do you have a kids restaurant without kids cups? Even nicer places that just have a kids menu carry special cups with secure lids to give small children.  Also, in the arcade, instead of having real carpet, or even real solid mats, there was just a thin clothlike sheet that posed more of a trip hazard than anything.    Overall- Yes, I would go there again, but I wouldn't pay for a kids drink that is just going to end up all over my kid, and keep a close eye on them in the arcade so they don't fall on their face."}
{"text":"Horrible service waited for over 25 minutes for them to make me a basic individual pizza. I actually think the girl that took my order forgot I asked for it because all the numbers after nine got their pizzas before me. I feel like they have the absolute worse customer service u have ever seen. They also took forever to clean up tables after customers left!!! To make matters worse I get the pizza bite into it and I asked for a spinach  and olive pizza and it had ham in it. If I ate meat that would b great but the fact that I don't pissed me off and the manager was not very helpful about it! Never ever coming back to this place"}
{"text":"The places we go for our kids. Of course this is not anywhere I would pick out the blue for my husband and I(no shade). You can't bet the price and my kids like CiCis. The pizza is better when it's fresh, of course. They are slow putting new pizza out and keeping fresh food out. My husband ordered some wings and it took about 20 mins to get. Yes the place could be cleaner"}
{"text":"Family friendly, fun environment, with super fast preparation...yeah that just about sums up Cici's Pizza. We have been here with extremely large groups of children (I'm talkin little league large) and managed to have a great time. They will prepare any kind of pizza you can dream up and deliver it right to your table.   This buffet style pizzeria comes standard with creations like the Macaroni Pizza or the Taco Pizza. My personal favorite is the Buffalo chicken pizza. The desserts are pretty solid as well. They always have hot cinnamon rolls and some other pizza dessert creation that usually gets at least two samples by me. For right around 5 dollars per person you get great eats, free drinks, and a limited salad bar.   If your searching for a place to host a fundraiser or maybe a birthday party you have to give Cici's a try. This particular location is packed with friendly staff and accomodating management. The only thing stopping them from getting 5 stars is the size of the arcade. Its really tiny and with a lot of kids that can get real bad real quick."}
{"text":"I'm always willing to try something on the cheap ... had two coupons for free kids meals and thought, why not.  We had a Cici's back home and that place was always hoppin', clean, great pizza, and good memories.  I loved the \"WELCOME TO CICI'S!\" walking in the door ... fast forward 10 years, 2 kids, and a move to AZ and whaddyaknow, Cici's opens a few joints here and there.  Took a while to visit because ... well ... it's in Mesa and I'm not that bid a fan of Mesa.  (reverse a bit because I have coupons - oh the incentive).  While it isn't the fond memories of my newlywedded youth, it was exactly what I paid for.  I couldn't spend that much money anywhere and not get a salad, soup, pizza for days, and dessert.  Nick on the TVs kept the young monkeys distracted while they mindlessly chewed.  I enjoyed the white spinach pizza the most ... and the cinnamon rolls are almost enough to make me go from satisified to oh-dear-Heaven-I'm-miserable.  The bad ... I'm always in for a good people watch and the clientele of Cici's is about what you would expect for the area.  My particular table had a slight \"lean\" to it ... probably from the area people sitting on it.  That's all I'm gonna say."}
{"text":"Let me start with the pizza was delicious as always. Unfortunately that is about the only good thing about our visit today. The first thing that was said to us once we paid, was that they didn't have any wings or pasta. Once we started getting our food, the napkins were not napkins. I had to rip off paper towels from a roll that is from the bathroom. We went to get our drinks and the pink lemonade was basically pink water. We settled on other drinks, but then we discovered there were no straws. The cheesecake swirl brownies, that are so widely advertised throughout the place, were nowhere to actually be found. So, not sure if we will be back to this CiCi's."}
{"text":"Under $20 to feed a family of 4?  Ok, so this place is the  best deal for your money when it comes to eating out with the kids. They serve salad, soup, pasta , wings and will make any kind of pizza your heart desires. They also have desert after you've done your pig out session with brownies and apple pie pizza and their cinnamon rolls are mmm mmm good..   Matter of fact I was just here last night.. I am disappointed to not see the old staff here last night..  The people that were there before were alot more friendly and welcoming and they kept the bathrooms clean.. Last night was not so clean, which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. But this is my favorite Cici location of all the ones in Vegas.."}
{"text":"Oh.My.Lord.  Let me just start by saying that I feel that the basic service that Cicis provides is solid. For 5.49 for all you can eat pizza, you can't possibly be expecting gourmet pizza.And it's not. For the price and for what it is, it's not bad. So keep your expectations reasonable.  Maybe I just went at a bad time, but this place was teeming with kids. I mean yelling, screaming, running, squealing, sneezing, I also understand this is like a cheaper alternative to Chuck E Cheese, so I was expecting it, to a much lesser extent. But it was just overwhelming.   The girl who rang us up looked like she would've rather taken a head first nosedive off the Strat rather than be there at the time. She was less than friendly, but surveying the scene I actually felt bad for the girl. My friend and I grab our plates and go for round 1. (By the way, we were the only people in the place who did NOT have a kid with us. literally). The Mac and Cheese pizza is a bit of a novelty, so I have to at least try a slice...and its okay. I put 3 slices on a plate and head back to the table. As I'm walking back to the table, a little girl walking by literally turns her head and sneezes right on the plate. Wonderful. That was a quick plate. From that point forward I literally have to carry my plate up around eye level.No joke. Also I recommend grabbing your slices from the pizzas set more towards the back of the display area.   The place wasn't very clean either and the restrooms were just gross. After 2 plates, my quite oblivious friend unfazed, I had to step outside to chat on the phone until he was done. A stiff drink at that point certainly crossed my mind.  I want to try and give them another shot one day, because under the right circumstances I think I could have a good experience here. But I won't even attempt it again until school is back in....and on a weekday....before 2 pm...and not on a school holiday...  till than..  2 stars."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. The employees are very friendly and helpful. If it wasn't for the emphasis on customer service I would have never eat here more than once. No matter how much my children begged, because the food is not good. The pizza is not good. The salad bar is not good. The soup is nasty. I would have given a one star, but the staff tries so hard."}
{"text":"living in norcal, cici's commercials used to always come on the tv there.  i remember thinking wowie, all you can eat pizza for 5 doll hairs, thats soooooo coooooool.  then i discovered that there were none near where i lived, so i got ready to walk across the freeway because there was no way i could live without cici's.  fortunately, i another idea popped in my head and said hey, don't kill yourself, just go to a cici's next time you're out of town.  i said ok.  when i went to vegas, another friend had the same exact incident, so we decided to go.  boy, talk about mediocre.  what can you really expect for 4 doll hairs.  the staff was very friendly, and they kept the pizzas coming out.  a good variety to choose from, but it was just average at best.  nothing spectacular.  again, i wasn't expecting much for 4 bucks.    i'm not trashing it, but i wouldn't go out of my way for it either."}
{"text":"Everything is pretty dirty here. Food isn't very good at all. Wanted to try it and I'll have to say, it's not very good at all."}
{"text":"Came here last month, looking for a cheap place to dine while in Vegas. It was about 1pm or so, and the place only had a few groups dining there. Plenty of seating.  Don't come here expecting fancy pizza. The crust is doughy and the ingredients are just kinda so-so. The restaurant is a bit aways from the Strip too, though that can be seen as a positive too. Wished they included a fountain drink into the buffet price, though $1.79 for unlimited refills is not something to complain about (pay a little more and get a to-go cup).   Here's the pros (and the reasons why this is a 4-star review): a cheap buffet. Weekday lunch buffets are $4.99, and I think $5.49 other times. It's AYCE of mainly pizza but 2 pre-made salads (perhaps overdressed), breadsticks, and a soup as well, and the staff are regularly pumping out a variety of fresh pizzas. They have this dessert pizza, cinnamon rolls, and brownies that are actually pretty good. Friendly service. And you can request a custom pizza as well, which is quite the draw! I ordered half pizza of anchovies & jalapenos, and they brought it right to my table, hot and fresh. How awesome is that?!  There are two televisions mounted on one wall (one was playing cartoons, the other ESPN); no sound though. There's a small arcade area in the back. Two restrooms, men and women, which are fairly clean. Plenty of parking.  Just found out that this is a pizza chain. *haha* Who knew? Wish they had them closer to my house though."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. I got the wings as well which is small upcharge but totally worth it with the pizza buffet. The quality of CC's pizza has improved from how I remember it last. Very impressed . Good for groups and parties and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"No the food is NOT good.  So why the 4 stars??  WILEY that's why dang it!  He made the visit fun and loud and just so much more digestive.  Love you Kid and never lose that sunshine, cause it felt GOOD."}
{"text":"First and last time we come here! We came in 1 hour before the closed and no one was at the front to welcome us. There was a girl cleaning she noticed us but didn't care to stop to greet us. Finally a man that I believe was the manager of the night was not polite at all he seem careless. On his phone all the time we were there. The place seem sad with low lights. The food was old and didn't look appetizing only pizza we liked was the phily one cause it was the only one that was fresh. I never felt so unhappy going to a cicis till now. It sucks cause me and my family were really craving Cicis and to leave unhappy sucks."}
{"text":"Poor selection of food. What was there was old and cold. Looked like yesterday's warmed over and it is noon! They should have run a half price special for this at least."}
{"text":"I always see the Cicis commercial. But there is no Cicis in California. So, I went to Cicis in Las Vegas. It was really Good. They had different types of pizza's and if they didn't have what you wanted they would make it for you. They only had two types of salads but they were good. I was disappointment with the pasta because I was expecting something with Alfredo sauce, but I cant complain because the one they had was soooooooo good. I would recommended to anyone that is in the area. I even took some to go...but I should have taken more! Next time."}
{"text":"We love Cicis and this location is just as good as the others. The new pizzas come out quick and they always have a lot of options and lots of dessert ready. I like the buffalo ranch pizza and the mac n cheese pizza"}
{"text":"First time here. The price is good especially a family of 6. Some pizzas were really good others were like why did I take this?! The salad bar was much of a selection but they did have many dressing options. Drinks are big and refills are free. It wasn't crowded so that was a plus."}
{"text":"If you clicked on this review. I know you aren't expecting a night of fine dining. It's CiCi's pizza for crying out loud! There are much better pizza joints in the valley. The pizza there isn't much different then pizza you can get at the store. Its not going to knock your socks off by any means. Plus side, it is a buffet. It's a good place to take the kids after school so they can pig out on pizza on the cheap. Even if it is a bootleg version of Peter Piper and Chuck E. Cheese. And really u should only go in there if you have a kid. If I see a grown ass man in there by himself eating pizza. Im going to be wondering if he's in violation of his parole/probation if you know what I mean. And if I see a couple in there on a date. Then im going to guess whoever thought of going to that place for a date. Is planning on dumping the person they asked."}
{"text":"Came here with our Scout Troop. This was a GREAT time and great food. The owner/General Manager met us at the door and had a superb customer service focus. I think the rest of the staff fed off of his energy. The food was much better than I expected. I had never been to a Ci Ci's and my expectations were very low. I was quite surprised with the quality. It was no California Pizza, but the prices were WAY cheaper. The price was an unbelievable bargain. I would definitely come again, even if I didn't have to bring 30 teenagers with me."}
{"text":"Last night my family at CiCis  Pizza.  We hadn't eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed.  The restaurant is under staffed.  We went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza's.  It's hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and NO PIZZA.  We waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made.  There were a few people working really hard but they needed more people.  The floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"I went here on one of my usual monthly trips with my boyfriend.  Like Scott D. said, it is cafeteria style. You walk into the entrance and wait in line while the cashier rings you up. She also gives you the necessary drink glasses if you choose to use the soda fountain. After you get your receipt, find yourself a table and dig in!  While yes it is quantity vs quality (what buffet isn't?), they do have a nice trick they do. They make the pizzas small, so they will get devoured quickly and then there's a fresh pie in its place ready to go up on the buffet line! I think every time I went back to the buffet line, there was always something fresh and new. They rotate the pizzas quite often, so you get to try lots of different types.  Salads are pretty generic. They come already assembled with dressing included. I wish they would put the dressing on the side, because sometimes too much dressing is overkill. I really enjoyed the white pie with chicken. It was like chicken alfredo, but on a pizza crust! The Hawaiian one hit the spot, and the Mexican wasn't too shabby either. There was one pizza that I thought was really disgusting, which was the tabasco one. I'm not a fan of tabasco though, so that probably didn't help me much either. The garlic sticks were thin, but flavorful and made a great paring with either the soup or pasta with marinara sauce that was also available.  Save room for the desserts! The cinnamon rolls are *TO DIE FOR*, especially when fresh out of the oven. My boyfriend and I had a foodgasm over them, because they were just so soft and melted in your mouth. DELICIOUS!! The brownies were pretty good as well.  Bring your extra stomachs with you, as this buffet brings food coma galore! I passed out for about 2-3 hours after heading back to the hotel."}
{"text":"The worst experience that i have ever encountered. I want to say that the lobby lady was amazing but everyone behind the pizza bar, horrible. Play tag and touching each other in a workplace. Like really people. Its ok to have fun but cussing and screaming not cool. There was a-lot of cucumbers on the tile and i stepped on it and almost slipped i told the chubby hispanic girl who was handling the cashier and she said tell the lady in the lobby cuz its not her job. But she said it in a rude way. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely \"DISGUSTING\" the worst nasty place I have ever been to. I have asked them to clean something up and they ignore you I said can you clean the floors they ignore you. How can you ignore your customers they have a bunch of kids running the show and and old lady taking care of the tables and they wonder why it's filthy. If I could give 0 I would do not go to this Nasty place you would probably catch something walking in here be careful!!! Toxic.. The warmers for the pizza are 8 inches above the ground under the buffet table nasty."}
{"text":"This Cicis is very inconsistent. Sometimes the food is good and sometimes they are out of everything or the food is old. The music is too loud and annoying and the carpet is always dirty. They also make you clean up your own dishes instead of having the busser come around and pick them up for you. The Cicis on Tropicana & Eastern is much better."}
{"text":"This Cici's has gone downhill since my previous review. The new manager is very rude, the pizza is cold and there is not much selection anymore. The soda area is always sticky and now it smells like the sewer. The salad bar was horrible with hardly any selection of vegetables. There were pieces of old pizza crust next to the utensils and the tables were all dirty and nobody picked up our dishes the whole time we were there. I WOULD NOT recommend this Cici's anymore!!"}
{"text":"I personally liked this location. The staff was great as well as the food.   They have a great bus man, I've never seen anyone so happy. He greeted people and wished them well as they left. I also made request for pizza from Scott (I think he was the manager as well) multiple times and he seemed happy to put the request in for me.   I got the BBQ pizza which tasted great. Their cinnamon rolls are crazy addictive. I had to special request the apple dessert pizza since it wasn't on the buffet line. Everything was fully stocked as well!  5.99 for buffet, or 4.99 during lunch on Monday-Fridays."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cici's in 10 years so I was excited to eat lunch here.  This location I must say is disgusting. The lettuce at the salad bar was all wilted and brown with a few soggy pieces. The condiments for the salad were un evenly cut,  partly frozen, and appeared old and waterlogged. The pizza absolutely sucked bad flavor and well just sucked.     The restaurant lobby was dirty the floor and corners of the walls were caked with grease and other nasty stuff. the walls in the booths are have pasta stains on the wall. It's obvious that cleaning lacks here"}
{"text":"Shouldn't complain for $5.99, there are starving children in Africa who would consider this a feast but this place is not worth $5.99 in America, especially \"pizza\". I've been coming on and off for the last 10 years & its progressively gotten worse. Management is a mess, don't have a decent variety (not everything needs pepperonis on it) & the amount of toppings has gotten significantly less and less throughout the years to the point where it's 75% pizza tough & & 25% toppings. You really pay $5.99 to eat crusty pizza dough with sauce on it. The majority of the food is dry and inedible & the staff just leave it out instead of making more pizzas when the restaurant is 45% full. Brownies shouldn't be the only dessert option on a Saturday afternoon also.   Also, it's not necessary for the tables busters to roll around every few minutes asking \"Can I have your plates\" while your in the middle of eating.   The owner needs to change management or just shut this place down. It's getting embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice before and have remembered they're super friendly, and today was no different. They're all smiles, and happy to serve, and even the manager walks around and helps with the pizzas behind the line. But I have to say the star employee here is Wiley. He is SO friendly, helps out with the dirty dishes off the table, and is always smiling. He really is a great person. 10 stars out of 5, this place is ran so perfect!"}
{"text":"Owner, Mike & staff were so friendly and accommodating to our group of Volleyball Players & parents. Thank you Cici's for a wonderful, inexpensive evening with great food! We loved all the options and the salad bar was great!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family on 01/06/2018, the worst Cicis I have ever been too, employees are rude they touch the counters and then go back and fix the pizza with there nasty hands. No pizza on the line, there was no plates .one employee licked her fingers and went back and put pepperoni on the pizza. Seriously, all I can is is wow. Once I saw that I took my family and left we did not even eat. All I can say is if you want to eat something disgusting and be treated like crap this would be the place to go"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  I wasn't expecting fine dining when I decided to take my nephew and three of his friend to CiCi's. However, I was expecting a better experience then what we had.  Cici's is an all you can eat pizza, salad, soup, and pasta restaurant.   So, lets start with pizza. The pizza offerings were at best, so-so. We requested a pizza to be made, but apparently that was not possible. Cici's only replaces a few \"standard\" offerings for dine-in eaters, and stuff crust pepperoni pizza, isnt on the list.   Moving on to the salad nar. The salad bar was freshened up frequently, which was welcomed.  However, the salad bar consist of iceburg lettuce, peppers, tomatoes, olives. No cheese, no egg, no romaine.   CiCi's offets soup and pasta on their buffet. The chicken noodle soup was all broth, no chicken, no noodles, just broth.  I asked one of the servers if there was any soup that had noodles.  She replied, probably not.  The pasta has a choice of  either Alfredo or Tomato Sauce,  both were watery and tasteless.  I know CiCi's is inexpensive, however, next time I will spend a bit more and go elsewhere.  I can eat almost anything, especially at an all you can eat buffet.  This time I couldnt finish a plate.  I would never revisit CiCi'sand and would definitely not recommend it."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this chain is the only one of its kind, offering \"All-You-Can-Eat\" Pizza for a most reasonable price.  But, that's not the reason I dine there, almost every Saturday.  I'm a member of a fraternal group that has a 2-hour meeting at a nearby business, beginning at 10 AM.  When we're done at Noon, we're hungry, and Cici's is conveniently located a short distance away.  But, that's not the reason I go there.  I judge an establishment by the way the personnel treat me and my friends, and I've never been treated better, anywhere else, than I am here. Manager Blake Beaudoin and his staff are truly unique, when it comes to dispensing excellent customer service, and THAT is what brings me back, time after time.  Blake greets me by name when I walk in the front door with my guests (I usually pick up the tab with my gambling winnings), and not only does he recall my name, he also remembers MY ORDER (double sausage, mushrooms, onions & black olives) and prepares it, almost without checking.  And, even though Blake is the manager of the place, you can see him mopping a floor or delivering pizzas to guests, just like any other employee.  He refuses to sit back in his office, shuffling papers; he wants to be where \"the action\" is.  The quality of the food is terrific, of course, but as good as it is, it can't equal the splendid service one gets, at this particular location.  Don't misunderstand me, please.  At any of the Cici's locations, you'll receive good food and great service, but at this specific venue, Blake Beaudoin truly exceeds my expectations, every time.  I guess that has to do with him being from Montana, where some of the friendliest folks on Planet Earth are known to live.  Do I have any \"complaints\" at all?  Just one.  The men's restroom has NO MIRROR, due to vandalism by some inconsiderate slobs.  However, all-metal mirrors are available, so perhaps one day, they might install one.  If you stop by this place, you'll definitely have good food and good times, and you'll become a \"regular,\" just like me."}
{"text":"It a $5 pizza buffet! Of course it's crap but you go into the place knowing that. They typically have about 5 or 6 different types of pizzas sitting on the counter at any time but they're pretty much just different combinations of the same ingredients. The only good pizza they have is the pepperoni deep dish pizza but usually, as soon as they put that out, it's gone. When a pizza is out and you want it, you can request a few slices from the next one that comes out, and they'll give you a big ass orange safety cone type of thing to put on your table. I don't know why but I don't like that. It essentially goes from a buffet to a regular order when you do that and you're typically waiting for like 5-8 minutes for the next pizza to come out because they probably don't throw one in the oven until the current one is at least half done.   They also have some brownies, some cinnamon roll pizza thing, some pasta and I think a soup and they're all crappy. Everything taste like it's some generic brand stuff from Costco's frozen food section. It's really not very good but for around $7 you can get unlimited pizza and a drink and sometimes that all you need."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Cicis. One reason is I don't do all you can eat much anymore. It was getting late and we were hungry and in the area, had a taste for pizza and salad. So why not, well it was cold in the dinning room my only complaint. People were friendly for buffet  it was good. I always load up on salad at these places. So, one plate of  and two plates of salad. Over all for a late  trip out to go shopping and get food it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I have been told by a number of folks that Cicis is the business.  No. It isn't.  It's mediocre at best; however, the price is stupid cheap for all you can eat pizza and salad.    If you go in with the expectations that it's cheap, then you won't be disappointed.  It's super basic salad choices, 5-6 pizza choices, and two dessert choices.  Buffalo Chicken pizza was the best of the ones I tried.  The staff-- hit and miss.  One person out right refused to make a personal pizza because she chose one too many toppings.  Instead of asking which one she wanted to skip, they made her start over.  But the guy who was cleaning the place was super friendly and did a good job.  The people watching was worth the cardboard pizza and stupid cheap costs.  If you don't expect excellence, you'll be fine.  I feel like this would be good for a person who is drunk or high."}
{"text":"Only one star and that was for the dessert.  This is the worst excuse for a pizza buffet I have ever had the misfortune of encountering!  The salad bar was messy and understocked... the pasta bar sat empty for over 30 minutes, the bus boy passed by our table more than once, but left all the dirty plates sitting.  The only slightly redeeming part was the dessert.  Save your money. Worse yet, when my date shared our concerns with the manager, he was just blown off like the concerns didn't matter! :(  Not going here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate Tuesday!! Woo!!   The staff were great.. really friendly, courteous and overall helpful. The price per person is as cheap as it gets I think.. literally like.. 6 bucks I ate about 2 large pizzas worth xD The pizza we had were good, was expecting to be a little dry due to the price becauae.. you know... supposedly \"you get what you pay for\", but the spinach fettuccini cheese thing was surprisingly good.. so I ate it...... all of it..  Didn't have a bad experience here at all... the game machines in the back though... took about 3 dollars to get one of those rubber band things in the claw game -_- .... DETERMINED!"}
{"text":"Cicis pizza is very good pizza the salad bar is good too the staff is way cool bodacious good stuff"}
{"text":"When we lived in California we kept seeing commercials for Cicis, finally in Las Vegas and went in and was sooooo Not impressed. The place was dirty, loud and the pizza was horrible, salad bar was a mess n had a funny taste. The straw that broke the camels back was finding a hair that didn't look like a hair from the head, was in my Daughters pizza. We left and Will Never return again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the manager/ \"franchisee\".  I placed a to-go order, got home and realized that the order was wrong.  I called the manager and before I had a chance to even say much, Jennifer (whom claimed to be the franchisee) said that I could come in now to replace the pizzas and that was my only option.  I tried to explain that I lived fifteen minutes away, it was a school night, and there was traffic, so I could not come in.  I asked for the corporate's number and she claimed that she did not have it because she was the owner of that location's CiCi's.  Realistically speaking, as the owner she would be the first person to have corporate's number.  Nonetheless, I will never go back to this location.  Even the buffet (the times I have visited) was mediocre and a little dingy."}
{"text":"Everytime i walk in to this place, atleast five people greet us welcome. Cant beat the variety. We always walk out satisfied."}
{"text":"Always happy to be back at Cici's. My son loves the cinnamon buns and the brownies..Also the pizza slices are good for kids too."}
{"text":"Caring owner and employees.  One employee even pulls out chairs to offer a seat.  Great price and environment.  Thumbs up to the pizza, salad and dessert."}
{"text":"For the price of 4.99 you can't beat it. They serve everything from red sauce pasta with white sauce pasta, macaroni and cheese pizza, flatbread pizza was amazing! they also have a good selection of desserts, lemon pie pizza and apple pie pizza. I also forgot to add that they will custom make any pizza that you would like."}
{"text":"My husband really liked this place.   It's a huge restaurant and the workers were very friendly.  Cheap meal with all you can eat pizza, pasta, and salad for $5.49.  Of course when you have a place this cheap it attracts certain types of people.  I noticed that a lot of the people there were really big and rush the line for the fresh pizza.  Other than that though, it was woth the money and I would go again."}
{"text":"The floors are dirty, the pizza is overcooked most of the time, and the management of the place seems to be ignorant and negligent. The supervisor on duty was reluctant to refund my daughter's two quarters from the video game only giving an excuse that they didn't own the machines and they were allowed to give refunds."}
{"text":"Poor service, employees on cell phones while on front line, frozen Bleu cheese dressing, old pizza. Reached out on Cicis website, assured me to try again with a coupon and never received!"}
{"text":"It's $5 for pizza lunch buffet. I'm not expecting spectacular pizza. It's edible and the fact that they will custom a pizza for you, now that's great!! Nothing at cici's lunch buffet is extraordinary, but it's good. And for what you pay, can't best it. You'll come in hungry and leave stuffed. Dont like the selection, ask then to make you a pizza with the toppings you want. It's that easy. There's always something for you."}
{"text":"We are sooo disappointed!!  We have beem eating here for years. This visit was particularly unsatisfying.  The pizza buffet at 1pm was wiped out !! The salad bar was super fresh.  I asked the manager person behind pizza buffett to make a special pizza and he acted like it was such an inconvenience.   When pizza came to table, it was overcooked, light in cheese and barely any toppings. The buffet used to have pizza with higher quality ingredients. It has gone down hill quick."}
{"text":"Best time here yet. Salad bar was great. Pizzas where on point.  Buffet for $6. Best pizza buffet around. A great add would be a hot dog pizza. But that is just a dream.  Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love some of the reviews that trash the place. $6 for all you can eat pizza with a large selection of toppings. Plus they will make you one if the one you want isn't out. Small salad bar but everything was fresh. Never have tried they're pasta.  Now the big negatives. Health rating was a 88 and the place was dirty looking.   But for the money it's pretty good."}
{"text":"It's pretty simple pay nothing for something. And their manager that is here every time we come is a hard working get stuff done kind of guy, always super nice to the girls. Bring an extra twenty for the games and happy kids ensue!! Another goods note, they have good fresh brewed ice tea."}
{"text":"After asking the cooks for a speciality chocolate chip pizza , they were like we don't make that . Obviously that's why it's a request like the sign says . Kindof disappointed about that , other Cici's pizzas I've been to never had a problem making it ! Along with other customers i noted asking for requests , they acted like they couldn't make theirs either . Seemed liked they just didn't want to go out their way ."}
{"text":"macaroni pizza! salad! desserts! pretty cheap buffet, great, enthusiastic service and clean, kid-friendly place."}
{"text":"First, what I liked was this Cici's had the stuffed crust pizza (which I never got at the Cici's  in my hometown of College Station, TX).  I also liked that the tables were cleared as soon as customers left. When my fiancée and I came, it was around 6pm so it wasn't too busy but had lots of kids running around. The pizza was fresh and hot. Wasn't too impressed with the selection of desserts though. The cinnamon rolls were gooey and had lots of icing on them. LOVED it.  My complaints would be that the floors seemed dirty, like they hadn't been mopped. I come from Texas, so being raised with Southern hospitality, I automatically thanked the table busser for taking our empty plates away. She gave me a strange look, so all I can say is never again. The pizza staff was awesome though, making sure pizza was always fresh and the pizza pans were full.  I may be willing to give this place another chance.....maybe."}
{"text":"This is the second time I went on a Saturday evening. The place is filled to capacity (i.e. No open tables).  There was a line wrapped around the restaurant as the buffet had no clean plates and very little pizza. It feels more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. Some tables had piles of plates. The soda machine ran out of ice. I am by myself. If I had my son, I would have went somewhere else.   The only reason for two stars is the food is decent and cheap ($5.99 for an adult buffet without a drink)."}
{"text":"WOW, this is fabulous. We have seen the commercials, but do not live near any, so on our Vegas vacation were determined to visit a CICI'S PIZZA. The manager and all the employees were very cheerful and welcoming. They explained how the buffet worked and repeatedly asked if there was any pizza that we wanted that they did not have out and would make it for us - no charge. They make your requested pizza in about 5 minutes and deliver the requested number of slices to your table. The brownies looked dry, but were moist and delicious. The deep dish pepperoni was fabulous, closest thing on the west coast to Rocky Rococo. I liked the bacon ranch tossed salad, the super thin crust peppery-sausage and pepperoni pizza, and the kids liked the game room. I know what you are thinking - what is the catch- $5 pizza buffet- well we actually paid only $3.99 (M-F lunch special) and $1.49 for a soda, and everything really was included. The pizza was tasty, I do not know how they do it. The bathrooms were clean too! I am anxious for a CiCi's Pizza to open in the West San Fernando Valley or the Westside of Los Angeles CA - hint, hint..."}
{"text":"I have this quest to write a review for every Cici's Pizza I can visit.  It's kind of like a guy who wants to climb Mt Everest and there are these stops along the way where he picks up supplies and Sherpas.  The Sherpas do all the work and get none of the glory. But in this case, I am the explorer and my stomach is the Sherpa wanna-be.  This is another good location.  On the corner of a quiet not busy strip mall.  It's located far off the strip and that's a good thing.  It's nice and clean inside and the staff keeps it that way.  \"Welcome to Cici's\" was said in abundance as people entered.  \"Thank you for coming to Cici's\" as people exited.  Always a nice touch.  A couple of TV's overhead, one on sports, the other cartoons, keeps everyone entertained in between bites of fresh pizza, cheese sticks, cinnamon things and such.    Don't see what you like on the buffet line?  Ask, and they will make it for you in a jiffy.  At your table in about 10 minutes.  Enjoy your salad while you wait."}
{"text":"I started this review back in Nov 11, and didn't get back to finish it.  That's what I get.  With all the Cici's I've been to, I was having a hard time remembering this one.  But that's not to say it wasn't good.  It just means, don't wait too long kids!  This is a nice location.  Far off the strip on the end of a quiet strip mall.  It seems fairly new judging by the building exterior and interior.  As with all Cici's, you get the \"Welcome\" greeting when you walk in the door.  Don't forget your military discount all you veterans with an ID card.  By now you know the deal, order when you walk in, get your salad (they have their own mixture like Olive Garden).  The follow the serving line.  Pasta is up next.  Basic fare.  Then garlic cheese bread.  Yum!  My favorite when it's cooked correctly.  And then pizza.  Usually there are 8 to 10 already made to choose from.  If you don't see what you like, ask, and they will make it for you.    They will ask how many slices you want or you can just take the whole thing if you're feeling hearty.  The pizza will be ready in a few minutes.  It doesn't take long at all.  At the end of the pizza line are a couple of dessert things; a cinnamon bun kind of thing and a chocolate brownie style thing.  I've never tried these or the pasta, but they seem popular.  Finally, get your drinks and go eat.  Nice clean location.  Busy, friendly crew.  They keep the pizza coming and the tables clear.  If you have kids (I don't) this is the place for you.  They rock with Birthday parties and large groups."}
{"text":"Second day in here we have from out of town I brought my two nephews that they are from Chicago and then love this food service was absolutely fabulous the people was so so so nice and the place was clean if I ever come back in Vegas definitely I will stop by here and I recommend everybody you cannot be 5.99 all what you can eat pizza"}
{"text":"It's a CiCi's. Anybody who has ever been to one knows what they can be like. Loud, poorly behaved children and their unconscious parents. Not sure, but I think a crowded CiCi's at dinnertime could be nominated to become a new circle of Hell.  But... during lunch and off-hours, it's hard to beat for the money. Decent salad, pizza, and dessert, especially if you're in a hurry. Lunchtime weekdays, it's a completely different place.  This store seems smaller and possibly a little dirtier than most. If you walk in and see birthday party balloons, abandon hope and go elsewhere. If the place seems to be mostly full of adults, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This was my first Cici's experience - and for the record, I loved it!  For $5, you get all-you-can-eat pizza, soup, salad, and dessert.  The quality isn't top-notch, but everything still tasted great, there was an excellent variety of pizzas (they even make them made-to-order), and the service was outstanding.  I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"The price was awesome. With that said, nothing else was... The line to get pizza at the buffet was so terribly long that it took forever to get anything and then once you would reach the buffet, there were only a few pizzas to choose from.  The staff were not pleasant. It was an atmosphere of doom and gloom while the place was packed.  To top the experience off, the other patrons were so rude. Most cutting in line!!!   Might want to think twice before choosing this place.  Sorry Cici's, my first visit will be my last."}
{"text":"When you get there order a pizza of your liking and then we'll make it for you then starting the buffet. This particular location totally help us out we needed to cell phone charger and they let us borrow one hooked us up with drinks and was very friendly thank you CiCi's Pizza employees and Regina"}
{"text":"The pizza is not 5 star, but for $4.99 and all you can eat, it's a pretty darn good value. The lettuce for the salad seemed to be a bit old. The pizza was good and they paid attention to make sure that there was enough on the line as they became busier."}
{"text":"The staff is soo friendly, especially Wiley his attitude is soo uplifting. I hope Wiley continues to win"}
{"text":"This use to be a great place to come to.  My experience on 02-01-2018, once I walked in the cashier was very nice welcomes me in, great job. Once I walked back to order a personal pizzas the young lady was rude to a customer ordering in front of me. She also was rude to me. I didn't know they changed there policy and everyone had to fill out a order form. There's always a way to tell the customer the new policy.  Won't be eating till this matter gets corrected.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This place gathers a whole other type of crowd to please for cheap eats . It's dirty and dingy not good food. It's a cheap buffet at best. I can't seem to find myself even touching the door handle let alone the countless times the serving utensils have been touched with kids who wipe  noses on their shirt sleeves. ..ugh!"}
{"text":"Came here for a early dinner with my buddy and his kids after moving. It's not even busy and there is not even a whole pizzaworth on the buffet. Employees are walking around with nothing to do. Make some pizza."}
{"text":"I came across town to this specific Cicis because they close at 10pm. I get there at 925 and they refuse to seat my party of 5 just because they are being lazy. Idc if your ready to go home or not. You advertise till 10!! If I cam at 955 I would understand.... Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there January 2012. First off, the food was gross. The salad was premixed and they wouldn't even let you pick any of the toppings out yourself you had to find someone behind the bar, which was harder to do since they only had one girl working the front for a little while. The lettuce was not crispy or fresh cause it was sitting in ranch WAY before I got to it.   The pizza was even worse. I completely understand the strange choices like cheeseburger pizza but a lot of pizzas were like that. They only had 2 pizza that were adult friendly. Those 2 pizza tasted like they were under the heat lamp to long and became dried out and hard.   The staff was really friendly but there was one worker who pretty much yelled as he worked. I was standing at the bar, while he was standing right next to me, he was talking to another employee who was standing on the other side of him but he was talking to him like he was yelling across the parking parking lot. I was VERY annoyed.   I went home to the website to find a email address to complain too, but the one they had on they site wasn't even working. Will not go again!"}
{"text":"As we walked to dine in we saw a child  (clearly unable to serve himself) drop salad on the floor and placed prongs on the foor, picked it up and threw it back on the salad. Mother finally came by placed the rings in said again and we told one of the workers and replied with : you just came in to tell us That? I told them I came in to dine in but after seeing that I will not. She replied with well sorry it's not like I can go throw away all the salad. DISGUSTING! very bad customer service and who knows what other food is dirty on the buffet! Never again!"}
{"text":"Cici's pizza is just what you pay for ... Nothing special but good for the price ...so the three stars is based on the food and price. If I could give five stars it would be to the employee Wiley who works at this location. I probably would not come to this particular location if it was not for him. He is super cool and nice and always greets us and ask if we need anything when he passes by. He also remember customers and tells them welcome back when they come again. If your ever at this location you will know Wiley from his great attitude and greeting every single person he passes."}
{"text":"My family raved about this place the last time they visited because it was so cheap and my niece and nephews were stoked about the food. It's pizza for goodness sake! Can't go wrong with pizza (even if there are some frozen pizzas out there that may taste a tad bit better).  We stopped by for a late lunch. I think we just missed the 5 dollar special and it ended up being $5.99 per person. Big whoop. A dollar more for a pizza buffet was no biggie. I tasted everything - bacon ranch salad, macaroni and cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, cheese pizza, veggie pizza, cinnamon rolls, apple pie pizza, and brownies. They even make a whole pizza per your request and bring in to your table. Everything was actually decent for the price. The manager came to our table to make sure everything was okay and was really personable.   I'm stoked that I didn't have to watch a dancing mouse entertain us during lunch and it's much cheaper with less kids running around. Prices were comparable to eating at a fast food joint. Nice option for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"This place, even though it's a pizza place, is actually really flexible when it comes to people who eat special diets. I don't do dairy milk, and the special order pizza system works great for me. i get the Buffalo pizza without cheese, and get some salad and soup while I wait. The service has always been great and I love stopping in."}
{"text":"This was our second time dining at this location .. the pizza is hot and fresh and staff was always nice. The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was bc of the awful  sewer smell that one worker told me it was the whole complex not just their store."}
{"text":"Great place to come bring the family yo eat....the staff was super friendly and I decided to Yelp about it due to an outstanding employee named Devin...it was our first time going to Cicis and he explained the buffet and menu...he was very attentive to our large family attending...cant go bad with excellent service and great pizza!!...when back in Vegas...this is a for sure stop!"}
{"text":"What seems like my all time favorite lunch plaza is Cici's pizza.  I've driven past this restaurant many of times thinking to myself, I have to try this out, especially becaust it is only $3.99 for their lunch buffet Monday - Friday.  Without the ordering a fountain soda, total is $4.32.  So what to expect at school cafeteria prices? School cafeteria food of course. If you went to a good school, then this means it is okay compared to other places.  As soon as you walk into the restaurant is the cash register, you have to pay before you eat. Which is fine by me.    The buffet starts off with the salad. So although I really wanted salad on this particular day, the salad may have been from the day before because it was looking wilted.  The chicken noodle soup I thought was really good. So at least I know where to go for the cold days when I'm experiencing a sore throat.  Of all the pizzas they had, I only tried four. The pepperoni and the spinach I thought was ok. However, I think they do really good job on the chicken alfredo and the chicken honey bbq.  For dessert, they had the fudge brownie and the cinnamon bites available which I thought was ok. The fudge brownie was rich and the cinnamon bites weren't overly sweet.  While there, I only saw two employees working in the restaurant area, the cashier and one person busing tables. Unfortunately, the one busing tables wasn't around very often, so while I was there, none of my plates were picked up. Because it was still early, about 11:30 am, the restaurant was nice and clean.  I thought it was interesting to see that they do have a little arcade area in the back of the restaurant. So its nice for larger families treating the kids and the family a night out where the smallest of pickiest eaters will be satisfied and the kids can play making it easier for parents to put their kids to bed. Even I plan to bring my family and all the keikis here for a reasonably priced Vegas lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed nothing like the commercials! !!!! The pizza was horrible,  the salad bar is a joke the only thing good was the desert. ... my family and i will never eat here again .Not only does the place smell like dirty diaper inside , id swear when you walk up it smells  like a Chinese place using msg ??? I only had a few pieces of pizza and i was extremely full so maybe  they do?"}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes, Cici's is fair.  The 5 stars is for the treatment my 4th grade students received when we went there on a field trip.  You may be asking yourself...\"A field trip? To Cici's Pizza?\"  Why yes! It's all about FRACTIONS!  This is our yearly field trip to close out our unit on fractions.  The kids pay $3.00 and they get a fairly good sized pizza (I think it's their medium) and a drink.  They also get a tour of the kitchen.    When they finish their tour, they are allowed to build their own pizza.  They can put pepperoni's on their pizza however they would like.  They were kind enough to accommodate my student who is a vegetarian and gave her a few veggie options to choose from.  I also asked them to cut each pizza into different fractional parts...some were cut into 6, 8, or 10 pieces.  Each kiddo had to then calculate how much pizza they had eaten and other fun stuff!    Now for the 5 stars...the staff!  They were SOOOOOOOOO friendly and were eager to share their jobs with my kids.  They encouraged them to ask questions and were just plain awesome!  My kids and I (and our parent chaperones) had an amazing time.  The pizza was delicious, as the teacher, I got to make my own...looked horrible, but tasted delicious!    Thank you to the staff at Cici's for  making our field trip so much fun! We had an educational experience but also really had a blast!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this location. The week before they were out of chicken soup. When they got some was luke warm. A health hazard. This last trip ordered chicken/mushroom pizza. They added sausage. I do not eat pork. They ruined my dinner and I lost trust. What is the person was allergic to an item. They would not give me GM's number. When I spoke to owner he appologized and offered a free pizza. He also mentioned he did not eat pork. He said he rather have customers contact main office not him. I contacted main office as of now, weeks later , no response. My only alternative is to file a lawsuit so they will take responsibility."}
{"text":"Wow what has happened to this place.  Starting with the girl behind the pizza counter. We asked for a personalized pizza and she said \"you don't see what you want on the line\"? Wait what? Of course not! That's why I'm asking for a pizza a certain way! Then she proceeds to tell me that the pizza I want they cannot make it. It's what's on the line and that's it. I said why? She said it comes from corporate! I don't know why?  I proceeded to go to dinning area. And it's disgusting! Totally filthy! Here are pics!  What has happened Cici's? This is definitely our last visit! Very disappointed and disgusted!"}
{"text":"Well.....its slightly better than Peter Piper's pizza buffet, but that's not saying much. This place sucks.  Its passable if you're broke and craving mediocre pizza. Why would you crave mediocrity though?  I sure don't.  Your best bet is to eat only the thin crust pizza, and then fill up on the cinnamon rolls, because those are surprisingly awesome."}
{"text":"I dont know what happened to this CiCi's but it went totally down hill.  The employees are rude, when you ask to make a pizza you get asked why.  The food is always old and dry.  Its always dirty.  The bathroom the last time I went in there was unusable. Step it up for real."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome!!! The service is excellent!!! Food was all fresh, hot & delicious! All you can eat for an unbeatable price! Everyone from the manager to the busboy, couldn't be friendlier. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went into cici's tonight and they were basically closed at 9 when thw door and website says 10. Hours of operation should be changed to 9 w take oUT til 10...poor customer service and will think twice before going back..."}
{"text":"Definitely Affordable. Great for kids. Service and cleanliness could have been wayyyy better but what do you expect for $6.. The pizza was okay. The good part is creating your own pizza!"}
{"text":"When you're real hungry and not up to paying a big bill, Cici's is the place. On my last visit at this location I noticed a slight change in the texture of the pizzas. The crusts should've been cooked more, too doughy. Maybe higher heat to crisp it up. Also, couldn't eat the brownies because they difinetely needed 10 min. more in the oven, too mushy. All else, was very good, and friendly staff, clean dining area, and constant attention by manager in keeping fresh food ready."}
{"text":"I love this place, just love this place! All the great food you can eat for a real great price.  I like the personal service, that you can your pizza your way, cleanliness of the place and bathroom. Just keep it up and I'll be back time and time again with my family!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in the world, not the worst. It just kind of is there. The flavor isn't there. They make the pizza doughy but skimp on the stuff that actually makes it worthwhile. Cheese...nah...toppings....nah...flavoring...nah.  The more carbs you fill up on the less your likely to eat. So by that reasoning making super doughy light on toppings pizza is the way to go.  Great if you want to eat a lot of pizza flavored bread...not great if you want to eat a pizza."}
{"text":"Went to this Cici's with the family and this was my granddaughter's first time. First let me say that the positive's were that the service was good and the buffet was maintained well. The negatives were that we had to get a high chair for my granddaughter to sit in and when her mother went to get the high chair all of them were filthy, they all had food and grease stuck to them from top to bottom. She had to use wipes to clean the chair. Also the isles are so small that every time the guy came through with the cart with the dirty dishes and garbage on it he kept on bumping the high chair. Very unsanitary place."}
{"text":"Order the 3 mediums for 11.99, can't beat that deal. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I will not be returning here again! The service is terrible, it took two people to run run a register and one was a manager. Neither one knew what they were doing, the salad bar appeared as if it was left out over night.The pizza didn't look any better. The sweet was boiling hot and the restroom was filthy and looked and smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned in days. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"First Timer....and I will happily be a \"regular\" here. I did not know what to expect. I walked in and was greeted by JASMINE at the register who was so patient and friendly. She answered all my questions, and made some great suggestions...Explaining the process. I Loved the Chicken Noodle Soup...and the selection of pizza's included a great assortment. All hot and All Fresh, made by the Pizza Baker  KAILENE. Great job keeping up with all the Orders, and the Buffet,,,quick and confident. The order forms surprised me, where you can also, for the price of lunch, get exactly what you want, made for YOU! GEEZ...couldn't get any better...And thanks to TREY who was keeping up with cleaning all the tables and the entire restaurant,,,it was a nice environment also! Thanks CiCi's,,,will return as often as I can,,,Even if it is just for some soup ...or a piece of pizza, the price will always be better than you can find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"for the price this is a great place to eat. the workers where nice and helpful. it can get very busy but its worth it"}
{"text":"2 Words: Food Poisoning   I was out for about a week. This experience made it into my list of most horrible experience I've had in my lifetime. Ummm yeah never again."}
{"text":"Its, cheap, has options, pizza is actually good for being a buffet setup and did I mention that its cheap?"}
{"text":"Yeah, I love Cici's. I am ashamed to admit how much I love it. It's not fancy at all, and the pizza is not fabulous pizza; however, for less than $15, two grown folks can get their bellies full of cheesy deliciousness. It's fast, dirty, and ultimately satisfying...kind of like a peep show in its way.  The place is overrun with children usually, as I guess families really appreciate the ability to feed a whole horde of folks this cheaply. And like everywhere with kids, it sometimes means that things are messy, spilled, loud, and sticky...but when you're eating as much pizza and cinnamon rolls as your heart can desire, it's hard to complain.  A night of Cici's paired with a dollar movie (or a $.25 movie on Monday nights) is a dream date in these economic times."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come at least twice a month. They need to add some meat to the buffet.  The workers are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love this place! My nephews loved it too. The food was fresh and delicious, in a fun, warm, and friendly atmosphere.  Every time we have been here, my family has really enjoyed it. No complains and above my expectations."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you're looking for something quick, and easy. You can even place an order for your own customized pizza- included in the buffet! Pretty good for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Pizza is bland, flavorless. Soups are pretty good I ordered a personal pizza with lots of garlic, but it didn't seem to have any. It's decent pricewise if you have a family to feed and you don't care about quality"}
{"text":"All you can eat pizza and salad bar. The best thing here is you can still special order the pizza you want and they make it in about 5-10 minutes. Try the thin crust pizza. It's my favorite pizza at CiCi's"}
{"text":"Ok. So many critics on this one. I think you have to keep perspective here that this is a $5.55 pizza buffet and not a $20+ dinner. This place is a good value for the price. It's got a salad bar and the feature I like the best is that you can custom order any pizza you want and they make it for you. I like their thin crust and when you order one it comes out fresh and hot. How can you beat that for $5??"}
{"text":"Over all I say good stuff. They kept changing pizzas and cheese bread. Nice staff, soild over all for what you pay."}
{"text":"$5 for a pizza buffet?! I'm sold.   Pizza's not going to be fanfreakingtastic, but it's hot and fresh with different combinations (mac n cheese on my pizza?? cool). Salad bar is lackluster, but what they do have is fresh and always stocked, and the counter is clean! Spaghetti and Mac'n'Cheese is basic, but I'm glad they have it. Everything is basic (except the pizza toppings), but it's all you can eat, family friendly atmosphere, with a super helpful staff. If you don't see a pizza that you want, they'll make it for you.   Thank you CiCi's for letting me stuff my face for only an abe lincoln."}
{"text":"Discusting place.  The door was fillthy when we first came in. Then all the serving counters looked as if they had never been cleaned.  Every single table was dirty. The ranch dressing bottle was so dirty when I touched it I threw the salad away. The refilled the bottle from a bag in front of us and never bothered to wipe the bottle. At the least get a clean bottle. The ice machine was broke. We were so disgusted we left.  After this experience we have decided to never step inside another Cici's pizza again.  Thanks for ruining this experience Arizona!!  Colorado"}
{"text":"I became sick and tired of Cici's advertising their damn 5 dollar pizza buffet on my tv and radio when the nearest location is over 300 miles away from my house! I can't possibly be the only San Diegan that has made a stop to Cici's while vacationing in Vegas, am I?   Anyways, the overall selection of pizza is awesome! Their customer service is very good, the ambiance is quite welcoming. The price? Unbeatable! I was just about ready to give this place a 5 star review...... until i took a bite of their pizza.    It was ok at best. The cinnamon rolls are this place's saving grace! Everything you need to know about the food has already been said about this place. Its all about value folks. Lets keep it at that.  I will admit that all that Cici's cheap pizza dough did a great job of soaking up the all the alcohol that was eating away at my stomach. I don't know that's a good thing or a bad thing, but shit, I'm ready to eat another 15 slices next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Place is really good for the price. Employees are super friendly and courteous. Manager is very upbeat and welcoming. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"My very first time coming here and I loved it. If the pizza isn't there you wanted they will make it hot and fresh then bring it to your table for you.... (yeah I know right) my entire family loves it here. Cartoons and pizza... every kid loves that.... ok ok ok I do as well lol"}
{"text":"Oh Cici's, the love of my youth, you have always been there for me and as of late I have been neglecting you and I'm sorry.   Cici's is one of those places you go to when you want some decent food, fast, and cheap. Over the years most of them seem to have declined in quality. They were not as friendly as they use to be. They are not as clean as they use to be. But, this location has held up to my standards, year in and year out. While others have turned me off to the point of no return, this location is still a beacon of excellence.  This location is one of the nicer of the Cici's I've been to as of late. The amount of flavors and the consistency are always great to see. I never feel like I need to wash my hands after every trip to the buffet. All of these are a great thing and the other locations around really need to take note of this.   It's not about the service as mostly everything is self-service, but how they maintain the restaurant is why they stand out over the rest. I have 2 other locations closer to me and I wouldn't even consider going to those over this one. I would drive across town to go to this location, it is just that better. The pizza is always hot, everything looks good and it is.   The only thing holding me back from giving a 5 star review is the food itself. It's just decent. It's not the greatest in the world and I don't expect it to be, but I don't go there to get the best pizza in town. I go there for the price and the ability to stuff my guts."}
{"text":"My first and last visit to this place.  My sister and I have been dying to try this place since I moved to AZ so we finally drove out of our way to go there. The minute we walked in we realized it was not what we expected. Way more like a fast food joint but that was ok. The guy at the counter was nice and we paid for our food and moved on. The salad bar looked dismal with an odd variety and a empty container.  We moved on and again were a bit disappointed with the look of the pasta station  but again we decided to move forward. We turned to the dining area to discover more than half of the tables were dirty and the back garbage area was pushing full with stacks of dirty plates. It's possible that we arrived at the tail end of a rush but no one in site to clean up the area. It's appeared that they had plenty of staff in the back so this made me feel cleanliness was not a priority. We went back to the counter, where we had to wait to get help. The guy was again nice and did not argue wanting a refund. I have worked in food service and tend to be pretty forgiving. This place was more than we could handle."}
{"text":"I would give this parti Cici's a -10 if it were possible. I ordered a specialty personal pan pizza which first of all took over 40 minutes for them to get it out to me. Not to mention, they were not crowded. When it got to me, the pizza dough was still raw, and it was not what I had ordered. The pizza bar was very empty. I am a Cici's pizza professional. I have been eating at Cici's for over 20 years. My kids have had several birthday parties at Cici's. I lived in Virginia for many years, where the Cici's are much different and much better. I will never ever go to another Cici's Pizza in Las Vegas. This is not my first horrible experience with this particular restaurant. The management didn't seem to have a care in the world when I brought these problems to their attention."}
{"text":"Too crowded!!! A better location is needed. The pizza was meh. The cleanliness (i.e. tables and floors) was minimal ."}
{"text":"Always dirty at dinner time. Limited selection of pizza unless you special order...Not a fan of this location."}
{"text":"I ate at Cici's Pizza on 10-07-2012 at the Nellis Blvd location.  I arrived as they were opening at 11:00 am, and was their first customer.  They had a good variety of Pizza out but I asked the person waiting on me if I could have about 4 pieces of pizza with anchovy's on it.  They said No Problem, It will be out in a few minutes.  I went ahead and had a couple of slices of what had already been put out and it was very good.  My slices that I had special ordered came out quickly, were very good and hot as well.  I didn't eat the salad bar, nor did I have desert, but it was available.  There was a person coming around frequently to remove dishes, and clean tables.  They had unlimited drink refills, and it was self service.  I was charged $6.00 total.  I found the place to be clean, friendly and the price  to be a real bargain.   I was very happy with the food, service, and cleanliness of this location.  They are a kid friendly place...and it's a great bargain."}
{"text":"So pizza buffet and a pair of daughters, ages 6 and 8 are a great combination. The kids like the macaroni and cheese pizza. The pizza is better than say Chuck E. Cheese and the service is fine. BUT.., my question is this, why were staff members exiting the building through the \"emergency door\" ? It appeared to myself and my wife that this was just a normal occurrence. A door marked \"emergency\" yet unlocked and apparently no alarm as marked. Right next to the video game room no less. Shame Cici's pizza, shame shame."}
{"text":"Cheap and to the point! you will not get gourmet pizza here but they try! the spinach and white is my fav! something your body can allow only once in awhile but great for large kid gatherings!"}
{"text":"We know we can find better places to eat, but sometime places like this keep reminding you why you do enjoy food.    The other night we had been to a buffet in the area, and spent a lot of money and the food quality was acceptable, but for the amount of food, it was nothing good.  We had remembered the ad from TV and decide to find one here in the area, and wow we were not that far from this location.  We arrived really not knowing what to expect, but the staff (thinking is was a manager) was very friendly, but most of all the one person that stuck out as friendly, helpful and smiling the whole time was the gentleman cleaning the facility tables and floors.  He was happy to be there, he was enjoying doing his job (yes, very messy job).  He stopped to talk with us for a short time, to make sure we were enjoying our visit, food and giving us recommendation to other things they make.  The staff is what set this place apart from other restaurants we have been to.  We do enjoy people that actually like being at their job, that is helpful.  The food was good, pizza was good and desert was fantastic.  The place was clean, and the restroom was maintained.  We would have to say if you are looking for a cheap place to keep cost down in your visit here, especially if you have kids, this is the place to bring them.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"My expectations were way too high--I've been hearing about this place from my boyfriend for a solid 4 years and I finally got to try it this week.   The place is one big open room, with mustard yellow colored walls and photos of their food nailed up. I'd say 85% of the customers (at least when I was there) are overweight, with a percentage of that being obese, hands down. Lots of kids of course, it's only $5.50, where else can you get a deal like that for a family with kids?  We'll go down the list here:  Cheese Pizza: Maybe this is the alfredo pizza Melissa C was talking about...it was just crust with white sauce and mozzarella. I needed to dip it in marinara to get some flavor.  Spinach Alfredo: Same as above, the sauce was more prominent and had cooked spinach. Good, but since I knew it was alfredo I only had one serving. Alfredo=super bad for me in my mind. I know, I know, I'm at a freakin' pizza buffet, but I felt like this one was higher cal than the other choices.  Cheese Pizza with marinara sauce: This was a rare occurence! I guess it kept getting snatched up by the little kids.  Macaroni and Cheese Pizza: I wish I had this when it was fresh out of the oven, but it was an experience. Interesting flavor combo.  Buffalo Chicken Pizza - I'm a vegetarian and even if I weren't I would have picked off the tiny tiny cubes of chicken. They didn't look appetizing at all. This one has cheese with drizzles of hot wing sauce--There was a little too much sauce on my pizza, I think the sauce could be changed, or the cheese, something, the flavor is just not balancing out.  Cinnamon Buns: OMG heaven. I love cinnamon. They were soft, warm, ooey gooey. Not your traditional \"cinnamon bun,\" it was a small bun covered, COVERED in cinnamon sugar/butter mix with a light drizzle of icing.  Apple Pizza - yummy sweet dough with an apple goo (no discernable pieces of apple here!) sprinkled with a streusel topping.  The desserts made the experience. Bottomline, I had been too hyped up on this place, the expectations were too high. I'd like to see some partitions or something in the restaurant to divide it up, it is literally just one big room filled with tables, I felt like I was in a cafeteria.  If they had this place in CA I would definitely go because 1. It's cheap. 2. It's a buffet 3. Dessert."}
{"text":"I was all happy to try this place out since my boyfriend loves eating at Ci Ci's.  Well, this place was not impressive by any means.  The food was average to below average, although I will say the stuffed crust pizza and the brownie was good.  (My boyfriend was a fan of the cinnamon rolls and the stuff crust pizza as well).  This place was disgusting.  I'm pretty sure there wasn't one adult on staff at the time.  There was only young kids running the place.  The girl at the register was nice but the place was just gross.  Most of the tables had plates and left over food, nothing was clean, it was just hard to even sit there and eat our food.  Bummed for sure."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, cheap price.  We keep coming back so obviously we come for the price! lol. A cheap way to feed 3 sons... they seem to love it. Quick & easy. They keep the place place pretty clean.  A nice older gentleman quickly picks up our dirty plates. I always order a pizza (u can do that you know) and it comes fast & hot.  I'm sure we'll be back.   A quote from my son: \"sometimes all you can eat just isn't enough!\""}
{"text":"The pizzas served at cicis are a little undercooked. However, the flavors are there. The buffet is 5.99 per person but if your dining in you need a drink as well which is 1.99 extra. So really your eating a 8 dollar buffet. It's still cheap for a buffet but it shouldn't be advertised as 5.99 because the catch is the drink. So you either pay 6 dollars to eat and choke or 8 dollars to add a drink. I give it a two star for good price and flavor of the food. Its now advertised that you can now have unlimited stuff crust pizza but there's none made and served. So that's a lie. I believe its whatever they feel like serving instead. The reason why i wouldn't really recommend anyone going here is because its really filthy. I pulled out my chair and laid my fingers in between the chair backing and it was sticky. The cups they give for buffet was greasy as well as the plates bowls and utensils. The wprst part was the high chair. It wasnt wiped down and it still had food stuck on it from the last customer and again it was so greasy. My poor baby, i felt so bad he had to sit on thay. Greasy greasy greasy.oh god, and the salad station. It smelt so bad, like something was rotting under the station or something. Overall its a really dirty place."}
{"text":"There isn't a Cici's in my neighborhood so I checked it out based on their television commercials.  The pizza has no flavor and the salad bar was a disgrace.  Not sure what I was expecting for a $5 lunch."}
{"text":"All in all not bad... but not too good either.  On the up-side, it is very cheap at about $6 for a buffet price.  Lots of salad, cold and hot pasta, sauces, bread sticks, pizzas and various desserts.  Plus has an arcade in the back if you have kids (or are just young at heart :)    The down side?  As one can imagine, charging a small amount for all this food, the food they use is not the best quality.  It's not bad or rotten or anything... it's just, ugh.  I liken Cici's to a drug.  You crave it and want it, but after you eat it you know from how it feels it's not the best thing for your body ha ha.    Overall, I eat there for the companionship of friends in a fun place while eating a lot of cheap food.  Is it good pizza?  It's not bad, but I've had much better.  If you're going for fun and quantity, it's 5 stars.  If you're going for awesome quality pizza, it's not on the list.  Hence my melding to get 3 stars."}
{"text":"My recommendation: be as creative as you can be ;)  As soon as you walk in you are greated with such a warm welcome that you have to stop and think if you know the cashier personally lol. The whole crew has an upbeat attitude and everyone is ready to help you with any question or request you may have.  It's a buffet for $5 so you can't expect gourmet food, but they try. If they don't have a pizza you like sitting out already then don't hesitate to have them custom make you one. I hear they have some pretty unusual ingredients too lol.   My favorite thing at Cici's is their cinnimon rolls. I probably eat more of those than I do pizza.   Overall, it's a friendly environment with decent food. Cici's is a great place for the family."}
{"text":"I was really impressed from the welcome to Cici's to the 9 hot and fresh pizza's that just kept coming. This is not $20.00 a pizza quality, but good especially at the price, even if there was 5 pieces left on a cold pizza it was replaced with a fresh hot one. There was one man there, that could of been the owner, and if not he should of been. Talk about a work ethic and service, he was on top of everything. Pizza after pizza coming out, plus wiping down the buffet, saying welcome to CiCi's. Just to watch this guy at work made my meal great. You could tell he cared about the place and the people in it. I have no complaints at all. Good Job"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, pizza was hood... not amazing but good. .. salad was good,  place isn't super clean,  but what do you expect with a bunch of kids running around. . Service was GREAT! All the employee smiled and made sure we were okay... thanks!"}
{"text":"Took my Son here for lunch last week.  We enjoy our CiCi's lunches....there's always a great selection of Pizza.  So, why did I bump them up a Star?  Because while we were there a soccer team with over 20 kids plus their families and coaches came in to eat.....and the CiCi's staff kept up with the massive demand of Pizza.  They'e really good at their jobs....and the Pizza is decent too.  Will I return?  You can count on it."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Cici's Pizza over the Summer thanks to a friend of mine that lives near one in the Northwest part of Vegas.  Since then, I've visited 3 locations in the Valley.  This was the third one.  My Son and his friend wanted to get some Pizza before the UNLV Football game on Saturday.  Since this location was on the way to the Stadium, we stopped here for lunch.  AYCE Pizza Buffet priced at $3.99 per person is pretty good....don't you think?  This Cici's looks relatively new and is very clean.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and it was packed!  However, it didn't stop them from pumping out Pizza after Pizza to keep everyone happy.  The boys and I went for plate after plate of Pizza.....until we couldn't eat another slice.  That held us over until we got to the Tailgate Party...ha!  Overall, great spot.....service was awesome.  They kept the Pizza Buffet full of Pizza with over 100 people in the restaurant.....amazing!  Will I return?  It's very far from my house, but next time I'm in the neighborhood....probably."}
{"text":"The one positive. The employees are friendly. We have been to Cici's Pizza numerous times over the last several years because for some reason, our children like it. I understand the pizza is mediocre at best. BUT, after the N. Decatur location closed this was the next closest location. The food was luke warm, no flavor. The Alfredo sauce was beyond runny & again no flavor. The red sauce was straight up tomato paste! Everything in the restaurant was dirty. Tables, floors, chairs, etc. I honesty felt gross being there. We broke the news to the kids after this trip, we will NOT go to Cici's anymore. We have had enough."}
{"text":"Upon entering, there were two ladies in front of me ordering take-out.  A gentleman, possibly the manager, behind the counter said, \"Welcome to Cici's\" and then walked away while the young lady at the register told me it would be a couple of minutes. The women in front of me finished ordering and the lady at the register stood there for a long time just looking at the register. Shecalled the manager over for help with something, he left and she continued to stare at the register. As I stood there, according to my watch, almost FIVE minutes had a passed since I entered the restaurant. She did not look up or acknowledge me again. I walked out the door, never being helped, paying or eating. If there is a problem in making me wait to take my money at Cici's, what other issues does this restaurant have?"}
{"text":"We had our sons birthday celebration at this location on 1/20/2018 and the service here was AWESOME!!! The manager (Mr. Arthur) accommodated our party size with a smile and our waitress (Ms. Nyza) was an absolute doll. We come here often and seen so many managers leave, this ones a keeper. We seen numerous improvements to this location since our last visit and I must say they are aim to please. My son had a blast for his birthday with his family and friends and we greatly appreciate it."}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive $5.99 pizza buffet. This location is always clean and quiet, prefer it to the other locations.  Can order your own custom pizza, no extra charge. Little arcade area for the kids. (Arcade and game area is not as big as the Centennial location, but it's in its own room which cuts down on the kid chaos) Love the desserts! Soup, salad and pasta bar too."}
{"text":"Wow...where do I start? Our precooked wings took about 25 minutes to come out. Then when we went to the salad bar, it needed to be restocked BADLY! They also had a pasta bar that had about 30 ridiculously dried up, inedible noodles. The pizza was average, with several of those varieties gone as well. Last but not least, the dessert bar was also empty! We waited an additional 20-25 minutes for brownies that \"only needed to be cut\".  We weren't expecting any high end pizza experience, but not having the advertised options available was rather disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a lot (way more than I should) and most of the times it deserves a 3 sometimes maybe even a 4 star review (although this location has almost never provided as good customer services as other locations), but during the last month or so the customer service has gone down, and yesterday's experience has possibly taken Cici's off my restaurant list for good- at least this location. Before I go into that, I do want to note that there is one person who consistently gives excellent customer service at this location- Wylie, the dining room attendant.  He is incredibly cheerful, positive, friendly, warm, and welcoming.  He stops at customers' tables to make sure they're having a good experience and always gives uplifting answers when you ask how his day is going.  He is great at making sure to send out a thank you for eating at Cici's when you're leaving.  If all the other employees were as good as him, Cici's would get a 5 star rating every time.  He is the ONLY reason this was a 2 star instead of a 1 star review. Now, back to yesterday- When I arrived, my bf paid & after looking at the food available, I asked for a special order- I had to ask 3 times before anyone paid attention.  It was very slow- maybe 10 customers in the restaurant- 2 of which were in my group and had arrived before me- no children, so the lack of customer service didn't make sense to begin with.  I asked for 2 pieces of mac & cheese & 6 cinnamon rolls w/ extra cinnamon.  The girl who took the order (Brittany the clerk) made a rude sound and suggested that I just eat what was on the line instead.  I looked again- the cinnamon rolls looked old and rubbery & the 1 available piece of mac & cheese was very dry, stiff, & old.  With so few customers in there, who knew how old the food was? I looked at the oven and noticed that there was absolutely NO food coming through.  Some of it looked like it might have been from the previous night.  I get that this is a pizza buffet, but it costs the same amount as regular Vegas buffets (a little more if you get a drink), so is it unreasonable to request that the food be fresh? Besides, I have never been given any problems when I've asked for a special order before. I asked again for my order. Brittany turned around & said unnecessarily loudly what I was asking for, the manager Jessica came to her & they talked quietly for a minute. She turned back to me & told me I had to eat what was on the line & her manager had told her they would not provide me with what I had asked for. She offered to put extra cinnamon on the already picked over (& I was right- they were very rubbery and old) cinnamon rolls. I was willing to wait until they put through a new batch of rolls & just get some of those with extra sugar but they refused.   Oh! Before I tried to make my special request, I also asked if there was any pasta- the bowl was completely empty.  I was informed by a girl who wouldn't even turn around to look at me that it would be out in 5 minutes.  It wasn't. And the other food on the line did prove to be very old- I actually had to give up on trying to cut through the brownies I got. In the past I have held parties, business meetings, and gone on dates to this location. I won't be doing any of that again."}
{"text":"A all-you can eat pizza buffet sounds like a great idea.  I remember when Pizza Hut had the lunch buffet and that was good stuff.  ALL all-you-can-eat buffets are awesome, right?   Most of the Cici's in this area closed but this one remains standing and I'm not sure how. Or why.  There was a short line when we arrived but it took forever and a minute to get up to the register.  The cashier was answering the phones, walking away from the register.  It was really frustrating.  Finally made it to the front of the line and paid our way to the full belly party. The food is not fantastic.  It's not even great. Some of it is not even good.  But it is all-you-can-eat... So they got that going for them.  T he restaurant is in pretty sad conditions.  Missing and waterstained ceiling tiles and filthy restrooms are the two that really stand out.  I really got turned off when they ran out of clean plates... and people started reusing their dirty plates.  Not cool people of Cici's, not cool. Don't you know the cardinal rule of buffets?!  It's like double dipping at a party - You just don't do it! It would take a really good review from a trusted friend to get me back into this location... Or maybe an empty stomach and only $8 to my name. Meh, probably not,"}
{"text":"The food was ok. But the place was a little dirty but I mean you do have a lot of kids.   Everyone is nice. They smile a lot I can tell they try a lot to keep it clean.   The plates are dirty and the area by the soda was dirty and it wasn't that busy so I was surprised. I'm not sure if I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Very affordable.  $5-$7 for all you can eat salad, soup, pasta and pizza.   You can definitely fill up on lots of pizza - mostly.  Place appeared reasonably clean.   Why 4 stars?  Salad, soup and pasta selections were very limited.  Basically, it's a pizza buffet and I was expecting more salad and pasta selections.  So when in Rome...I just filled up on pizza.   On that note - for the price, the pizza was tasted just fine.   ****They do offer a military discount which upgrades your meal to include a beverage.  I gave them a bonus star for that."}
{"text":"So just like: SONICS, DAIRY QUEEN and GOLDEN CORRAL... living in Los Angeles, for years I've been subjected to commercials about CICI'S PIZZA (endless pizza buffet) ...even though there are NONE in L.A. Finally saw one in Vegas and had to go.  ========= LOCATION =========  Not nearly as big as I envisioned in my head. Their website listed 24 varieties of pizza so I imagines a looooong buffet line. Nope. There's like 10 pizzas out and every 10 mins they rotate new ones in and out. There's also desserts, salad and pasta on the buffet.   ========= THE FOOD =========  ~ MAC 'N CHEESE PIZZA - The best item on the menu. Your basic pizza slice with with Cheddar sauce on top instead of mozzarella. Mac n' Cheese atop... so bad for you but so good. (4/5)  ~ CINNAMON ROLLS - Decadently delicious homemade cinnamon rolls topped with icing. They weren't cinnabons but REALLY REALLY good nonetheless. (4/5)  ~ ALFREDO SPINACH PIZZA - A creamy alfredo sauced slice, topped with mozzarella spinach and herbs/seasoning on top. (4/5)  ~ CLASSIC CHICKEN PIZZA -  Diced chicken, fresh sliced mushrooms with zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)  ~ ZESTY VEGGIE - It's a veggie with WHITE sauce. Pretty good. Freshly sliced mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, diced tomatoes and black olives with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)  ~ BAVARIAN DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Really good. Rich Bavarian cream filling served with sweet crumb topping on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)  ~ APPLE DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Surprisingly good as well. Warm cinnamon apples and sweet crumb topping drizzled with icing on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)   ~ DEEP DISH PEPPERONI & JALAPENO - It was surprisingly decent. (3/5)  ~ BUFFALO CHICKEN PIZZA - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust. Closer to a 2.5, it's hard to make a mediocre Buffalo Chicken pizza but they managed. (3/5)  ~ OLE - It was \"supposed\" to be like a taco, it's a big mess of whatever. Beef crumbles and fresh lettuce with spicy red sauce topped with shredded cheddar cheese on our traditional crust. (2/5)  ~ PEPPERONI - It was \"whatever.\" (2/5)  ~ PASTA - It was pretty bad. (1/5)  ~ BREADSTICKS - They \"looked\" good but they were terrible. Waaaaay too salty. (1/5)   =================== THINGS I WANT TO TRY ===================  HOG FEST - Crisp bacon, Italian sausage, sliced ham and pepperoni with classic tomato sauce topped with shredded cheddar and pizza cheese on our traditional crust.  BBQ CHICKEN - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust.  ZESTY HAM & CHEDDAR - Sliced ham and sharp cheddar cheese with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese on our traditional crust.  GARLIC ITALIANO - Diced tomatoes, sliced red onions and black olives, garlic butter sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and garlic oregano parmesan seasoning on our thin and crisp Italiano crust.   =============== FINAL THOUGHTS ===============  There's a $5.00 all of July special going on which was awesome. All-in-all it's not the best BUT for $5 I can't complain. Some of the pizza was horrible, some was decent... a few items were good. Just googled... there is one in Ontario and one in Compton. I'll probably check out one of em soon."}
{"text":"What a great place to go for an awesome lunch buffet!  I love their salad bar, chicken noodle soup and their assortment of pizza is yummy!  Plus they respect the USA Veterans with a nice discount!  The staff is always professional and the establishment is always clean!  Great place to take co-workers, family, and friends.  You never leave with a empty stomach.  OMG The Calories, guess I will workout after.  LOL"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Below average food.   With litle extra money I would probably go to a better buffet. Will not return."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place is getting any stars is because the employees are AWESOME. I would give 5 stars to the staff alone. The owner, however, is very unprofessional and rude. Honestly, pay a little more somewhere els for better quality food and service."}
{"text":"This is usually a decent place but for some reason it was excessively dirty today.  The pizza wasn't bad but the bathrooms were filthy and the tables were all still very messy even after they cleaned.it.  probably won't be back after this visit.  We have been here numerous times in the past and never had this issue."}
{"text":"If you don't know what Cici's is it is basically a big pizza buffet at a really really cheap price. Like dirt cheap. Think 6 bucks a person cheap, lol. All you can eat pizza, salad, drinks, pasta, and dessert.   Food is usually fairly decent and service (at least at this location) has always been very good to us. Finding a coupon is usually not very difficult and it can knock off a few bucks or even get a second person in free, so don't hesitate to do a quick search before going!   The big thing that draws us here though is that for the price of the buffet, you can just walk up to the guy behind the buffet counter and request a custom pizza order! So if you don't like what is currently being offered, just ask for what you'd like, they give you a little colored cone, and in a few minutes you get a fresh pizza at your table! We always do this since we like the veggie combo and it tends to vanish pretty fast on the buffet line.   Big turn off for this place is the whole buying drinks on their own business. Bah, a buffet should include the drinks in my opinion... ah well. Still, good food for a cheap price and when you are on a budget this place is pretty sweet. Also, the cinnamon buns are awesome!"}
{"text":"Pizza buffet..........that's if you can get to the pizza.  We stopped going here for several reasons. 1) VERY LOUD guests. 2) RUDE guests that cut in front of you when your standing in a line. 3)Children running wild.  Parents, caregivers just let them loose.  We aren't in Chucky Chesses! 4)After you sit down, and if you wanted a certain pizza, you have to watch the buffet line to see if they will bring a new pizza out.  Then it's a MAD dash to the supposedly \"line\" to get a slice.  On the plus side, if there is a certain type of pizza that you want and it is not on the line, you can order it, but it takes at least 15mins to get your pizza.  That's ok though."}
{"text":"I'm feeling the review below me - CiCi's pizza isn't located anywhere near me. But there's some in Vegas?!? We gotta hit that up.  It was cool - I like pizza...  I am accustomed to larger buffets though, and less expensive fountain drinks. Everything was the kind of quality that could whip up in 10 minutes or less. It also didn't help that there was some weird fundraiser going on where this loud guy was announcing all this weird crap I didn't care about. I was still hung over and wasn't prepared for this kiddie festival - excuse me. The commercials don't advertise that it's like a Discovery Zone without the playground.  Nonetheless, some of the pizza had tasty combinations. And I suppose at $5 you can't complain too much when it's all-you-can-eat."}
{"text":"The place is filthy and horrible we left after 10 minutes,oh well thats what you get  for $6 buffet i guess..never again!!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to eat here, order your own personal pizza.   The staff was friendly although I was a little surprised that the cashier had such a hard time taking a gift card and then subtracting that from the total to receive cash for the remainder of the bill. We spent 5 minutes at the front having her try to figure it out. Eventually she threw her hands up in the air and I'm assuming it was the assistant manager came around and helped her out.   We came in because we read about the $5.99 lunch buffet (Which we assumed it included a drink) it did not include a drink and the drink itself cost $2. Why don't you just charge me for everything at once instead of being all sneaky with your costs? Made me not trust them.   The salad was good, I wasn't impressed to see the dressing in squirt bottles though. Depending on which slice you picked up the pizza could either be really good or really bad. My friend and I got the same kind of pizza, and hers tasted horrible while mine tasted freshly made. That happened with every pizza we tried until we had them just make us our own pizza. The only explanation I can think of is that they just keep the old slices on the warming plates and add fresh pizza when they need it. It was super gross.   The dessert pizza was pretty good but we ran into the same thing. Some of the desserts were fresher than others. I had one mini cinnamon roll that was delicious, moist and warm while the next one was hard as a rock, dry and disgusting.   I hope they get this fixed. I don't think I'll come back unless they do. I would need them to fix their prices too; either include the drink in the $5.99 price or charge more for the buffet and include the drink but don't make me choose whether or not I'm going to have a drink with my meal right when I get there. It was really sketchy and rude.   The atmosphere was horrible. At least for someone in their mid twenties. We sat across from a TV with Dora the Explorer on and the music that was playing had to be from the Disney Channel. I guess they're catering to kids?...It wasn't very clean either, the floors and tables could definitely use a renovation. The bathroom doors had greasy fingerprints all over them from top to bottom.    The only plus I can say to this place is the service was friendly. Even so it seemed like I was back in high school with how much they joked around even with customers. I don't need someone to do voice impressions of a redneck for me when I'm picking out pizza. If I wanted to go back to High School I would. I don't think I'll be coming back here though."}
{"text":"THIS. Was good Cici's. The other location on Maryland Pkwy was horrific. This one was fantastic. Just shows you how inconsistent chain restaurants can be.   When we walked in it was all put together, I knew what I was getting in to. The cashier was friendly and knowledgeable and the workers there were more concerned about making great pizza than palling around with one another *maryland location*. The music was good and there was a game on so it was easy for everyone there to relate and feel comfortable.   I tried some pizza from the line as well as ordered my own personal slices and I was NOT disappointed. It was delicious! ESPECIALLY the pizza that I had ordered! YUM! The cinnamon rolls were so soft, I could tell they had just come out of the oven and the dessert pizza was to die for. I was so disappointed/disgusted at the last location but this location redeemed Cici's Pizza for me. I will be returning to this location to have really delicious pizza and a great atmosphere! YUM!"}
{"text":"Not the place for grown ups...lol! The the best customer service.  A place big kids and small ones if you're on a budget. Want come here again. High chairs were disgusting I refused to sit my baby  in any of them. I will let the teenagers have this place. If I want pizza I will call Pizza Hut or papa john's or better yet chuck e cheeses."}
{"text":"Well I will say I wasn't expecting anything this good tasting from a pizza buffet. I've heard of cici's pizza and have even seen their commercial on t.v. in my own state of CA, yet we don't have one in so. Cal as far as I know.? So I tried their noodle soup, i say this because it tasted like vegetable soup but had the smallest piece's of chicken in there I'd ever seen in it, yet it was delicious. I had 3 bowls. I also tried there mac and cheese pizza. That was different tasting.... But it was also very good. It had a different sauce on it, not shure what kind but it's good. Tried their stuffed crust pizza also and it was really good tasting. Heck all of it was awesome. I will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Cicis Pizza has wonderful service and the workers are wonderful. I always find my needs and my stomach  satisfied after every visit."}
{"text":"Less than fifty dollars for a family of seven with drinks. Is a super deal. My family and I are from California therefore we do not have a Cici's nearby.  So anytime we come to Vegas we come to Cici's! The salad bar is packed with fresh veggies. The pizza options are super yummy and delish! I enjoy the variety of all the foods.  My favorite is pepperoni with stuffed crust. Filled with an abundance of cheese. Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"I don't even know how to express the horrible experience ! The place was disgusting, the carpets were filthy with trash and food, the cook in the back had a horrible attitude he had the nerve to say \" oh they decided to bring their appetite tonight\" he than said I can't keep making pizzas if you all eat them all . It was by far the worst customer service . The salad dressing was old the salad was old. Also, to top it off the restroom toilets leak all over the floor and the sink has no handle so it doesn't even work !!! Smh ! Don't waste your time ! It sounds cheap but it's horrible"}
{"text":"The pizza is usually good, but the people all seem to be bored, the audio sounds like they couldn't find the right static-free channel on the radio, the TVs are from the 60...needs a makeover to at least the 20th century."}
{"text":"After seeing so many commercials about this Cici's Pizza, and then finding out the nearest one was in Las Vegas NV I made it a point to stop when in Vegas this last time I visited.   People : This is an AYCE place that charges $5 - how can you excpect it to be compared to CPK or Mortons ? I don't get it...   I read the reviews so I was expecting what can be expected of an AYCE. The food was OK and it helped that I was in an inebrieated state but the MAC and CHEESE pizza is AMAZING !   I noticed that 85% of the people there were dumb blondes who were simply poking at their plates for fear of gaining weight.  LOL. But really that girl must have gone on a night where she was the ONLY skinny bitch in there... I digress. YES there is fat people everywhere - but who cares ??"}
{"text":"must have the cinnamon creamy goodness that they serve.  the pizza is okay but im there for the dessert!  love it  ps. yay i got a first review hehehe"}
{"text":"MORTIFIED! Growing up in Texas I loved CiCi's pizza and was excited when they opened up in Vegas. I got there at about 8 PM. tonight and the place was about 25% full. There was no where to sit because almost every table had plates on it (dirty buffet plates). AT first I thought maybe they were just short handed. Right away I noticed the cashier kept filing the salad and dressings without washing her hands. She was touching everything! Money, dirty rags, trash and then would go fill the salad and move the pizza around. I went up to the pizza counter to ask for our Pepperoni pizza that we had ordered about 20 minutes before and they had forgotten to make it. As I stood there I noticed the cashier pull a pizza out from UNDERNEATH (below the pizza counter) the counter and set it under the heat. I was horrified to see a sausage pizza that had been sitting out (already cooked) placed underneath the heat lamp. We left and didn't even eat more than a plate of food after being disgusted by the slop fest of CiCi's pizza. The worst part is that the cashier clearly did not give two cents about anyone eating dirty food. I feel gross just knowing I ate anything.   The place was dirty, the bathrooms had graffiti. NEVER again will I eat here."}
{"text":"$5.99 for all you can eat lunch. Not bad for all you can eat pizza, but my personal preference for AYCE pizza is by far Round Table. I don't really care if its a little bit more expensive its better quality pizza by far no questions asked.  BUT...  I would literally come here and pay for all you can eat pizza just so I could spend an hour stuffing my face with there cinnamon bun dessert.. Like oh my god these little pastries came from heaven and nothing will ever be better.  The place has a bunch of ratchet girls working for them who have major attitude, and lack basic customer service skills, but if you can move past their bitchy teen aged personalities you should go have some dessert, like right now.  I'm not kidding.  Go."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant before in Florida but this Cici's pizza buffet was awful. The place was filthy with soda all over the floor. The pizza was fair but the staff could not keep enough pizza out for the patrons.  The salad bar was small and not stocked. The staff would replenish the macaroni salad with his hands.  The pasta was soggy and overlooked. The sauces were bland.   There was not enough staff to keep the place stocked and running. One bus boy to clean all the plates and trash was terrible.  There was trash out side the place all over the sidewalk.  The only good thing: The young man checking us in at the entrance was very nice and seem to know his job.  I would never come back here and I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a good cici's. Clean, good manager and staff. The tables are busses continuously. BTW... its close to carowinds amusement park."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for pizza and don't have a lot of time to eat, this is a good option for you.   =Location= Conveniently located at the corner of S. Eastern and E. Tropicana Ave, this location is easy to get find and get to. Parking is shared with the neighboring businesses, so at times it's hard to find a close parking.   =Food= Cici's is a buffet style pizza place. With a salad bar, pizzas, soup, pasta, and desserts. The salad bar is very limited but has all the basic stuff to make a salad. Wish they had more options though, as I LOVE salads. The pizza part of the buffet has the largest selection, but in my option could have more vegetarian options. I pretty much stick to just the veggie pizza. Not a big pizza person, so I'm picky when it comes to pizza. I do really enjoy their chicken noodle soup here. Full of flavor and has the perfect amount of chicken and noodles in it. I don't care for their desserts, so I can't really review on it. Oh yeah, I must mention that if you don't see a pizza you like out, you can request a personal pizza and they'll bring it out to you as soon as it's done cooking. No extra cost for this option.   Costs: $5.99 for adults and $4.25 for kids. The drink is not included in this price.  =Customer Service= The staff here are usually very friendly. One of the workers behind the counter will greet you as you enter. There is someone who is constantly going around cleaning off tables and making sure the floor is cleaned up. At busy times though, the tables can go uncleaned until you let them know that it needs cleaning.   =Ending thoughts= 1. I don't like how parents allow their kids to go up to the buffet on their own and get their food. On more than one occasion I've seen a kid get food and then put it back!! I was pretty sure I've seen a sign there that says kids under a certain age have to be accompanied by a parent.   2. I never know if we're supposed to leave a tip here or not, but I always do."}
{"text":"I been coming here for many years but lately it's tastes different. The pizza is only good when it's right out of the oven. There aren't very many options of pizza. The restaurant is very messy and the floor is disgusting. The pasta is always soggy and mushy. Over all I would say it changed and isn't a good as it used to be."}
{"text":"The food is good, but GOOD LUCK to you if you want to order take out. This location RARELY answers the phone. I'm sure they've missed sooooo much take-out business because they refuse to answer the phone on their slowest days...very disappointing to their loyal customers like me."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, excellent value. Never have I ever tasted such gourmet craftsmanship in an artisan dish. Clean location with kind employees keeping those pizzas coming. There were no napkins on the tables which resulted in me having to take more trips to the drink machine. But hey, there are far worse things in the world. I did have an issue with other patrons continually yelling at their son, Gino. He wasn't doing anything too heinous but mom and dad constantly yelling was ruining my buffet time. The brownies was covered in delicious powder sugar cocaine. D-LISH. 4 stars Mesa. Keep up the great work. I hope to one day franchise my own CiCis."}
{"text":"My children enjoy spending time with their  grandparents and CiCis is often an affordable choice with everyone leaving happy and full after their meal. Unfortunately, the customer service was below standard today and pizza selection for a buffet was not only limited but very poor quality. It is not an establishment we frequent, however, there was a noticeable difference in the overall experience and will not be returning in the future. It seems worth the time to write a review when young children make comments that are consistent with the observations and general opinion of the adults that were not shared openly with them. CiCis needs to reevaluate their customer service before it is too late."}
{"text":"This CiCi's location definitely has gotten better with time. First time back in there since the deadly police shooting and I have to say that it was a pleasant experience because there wasn't a bunch of kids running around and their parents doing nothing about it. We got to sit where we wanted because it was almost empty and I didn't have to listen to jabber from other people.   One thing I did notice is that they put a picture up honoring the 2 fallen police officers and that is completely AWESOME! So much respect goes out to them for that.  Food was really good and fresh and the shift manager was eager to make anything we wanted. Over all good experience."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the lunch buffet right when we got into town from Los Angeles.  Food was good, exactly what we expected.  My favorite was actually the cheese bread and of course the cinnamon rolls!  The place was busy and I want to specifically compliment Matt because he was the reason everything was going so smoothly.  He was single-handedly running the kitchen, helping guests at the buffet and taking customers at the register; all while keeping a positive attitude.  I hope he is well compensated because I imagine an employee like him is hard to find and even harder to keep.  We will come back specifically because of Matt."}
{"text":"First off 5 bucks. Can you think of anything that will fill you up for 5 bucks? Especially something that is also orderable. Order a supreme and they will make it. What I don't get is the people who are giving low and bad reviews. You give a bad review but yet you eat there weekly. Go its well worth your 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for kids...and Adults. Has a variety of pizza to choose from and if you don't see one you like they will make a whole pizza just for you and bring it to your table! There is a kids gaming area in the back that kids can play video games or air hockey. They have great desserts and you can't beat the price for all you can eat. Don't forget to get you punch card validated. With the purchase of 8 buffets you get the 9th free. The to go pizza is a great deal and we will be getting the food there for our daughters b-day party in June."}
{"text":"For years, Cici's was one of our family's go-to places for a quick bite at a good price. Decent pizza, serviceable salad bar, fairly clean atmosphere. Not any more. We went tonight (we hadn't visited in several months) and while the restaurant had been redecorated, it was thoroughly disappointing. The ladies room was filthy (two of the three toilets were not operational - one covered in gross plastic sheeting, the other filled with paper towels; the stall housing the one working toilet was covered in greasy fingerprints and the toilet paper roll dispenser was broken, causing the roll to fly across the dirty floor and my daughter had to track it down).  In the dining room, there were soda spills, pizza crusts and other large food particles under tables and chairs. One employee whose job it appeared to be to clean the dining room chatted with two customers (friends, perhaps?) for the entire 30 minutes we were in the restaurant.  In years past, employees bused tables (we always left a nice tip), but now, customers must bus their own tables - a duty I don't mind at a nicely maintained restaurant like Panera, but one that's totally unappetizing when the trash can is overflowing and dishes are piled up with no demarcation about what goes where. (Dirty silverware, plates, bowls all heaped on top of each other to the point of falling over.) The new dessert offerings are disappointing (bring back the fudgy brownies please!), and in general, my three kids and I left feeling sad that one of the few restaurants they can usually all get excited about isn't an option for us anymore."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a family with kids. They have a small arcade, lots of kids food (pizza,pasta,bread sticks,brownies,salads) it's buffet style, and it's just a chilled laid back place to take the kids. I gave it 4 stars only because I noticed they have a hard time keeping the buffet area cleaned up. Not sure if they were slacking the night I was there but there was dressing and food spilled all over the counter area and no one seemed to be cleaning it up. Of course there was a huge flow of people eating but in my opinion that area should be cleaned up as often as possible. It's not cool to see a messy area where food is. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since I moved here for University.  Great food at a great price.  Ya can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"This is the worse Cicis in Las Vegas.  The bathroom was filthy and several tables sat with trash and plates on them for the hour we were there.  The new lemon dessert looked nothing like advertisement.  Fresh pizza was not put out till more people came in."}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about. My family and I see tons of commercials for CiCi's Pizza in California but when we go to look up the nearest one, Nevada is the first location that pops up.   That weekend we happened to be in Las Vegas so we decided to check it out.   Food: If you didn't know, CiCi's is an all you can eat pizza buffet. The pizza selections are basic. Your classic pepperoni, cheese, combo and then they have specialty pizza. Mac and cheese pizza, sausage, pineapple only, and so forth. BUT there is only about 7 different pizzas at a time. They have soups which are not that good. A basic salad bar and sweets such as cinnamon pizza not as good as Woodstock's and brownie pizza also not that great.  Ambiance: It feels like your normal pizza joint. In comparison to Round Table or Mountain Mike's. There was a small arcade at the location we went too, nothing crazy.  Service: This is why I gave this place 3 stars instead of just 1. The cashier was a nice woman, she had to deal with a large birthday party and all the customers coming in and out. The cleaner, who was African American, he was phenomenal. I wish I got his name because he deserves most of the credit. Always making sure the tables were cleaning, collecting dishes and this is what made my day. He would always ask you, \"how was your meal? Did you enjoy your time here? Is there anything we could do to help you?\" He had a smile that could light up the room and a positive attitude.   Other than the amazing service, I wouldn't come here again to be honest. Not the best pizza around, way over hyped!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was cold and stale. Definitely not worth 6 bucks. That was my first and last time taking my family their.  The place was clean and the workers are nice but the food was just unbearable."}
{"text":"I'm not even going to talk about the food here because you probably already know, it's two steps ahead of school lunch pizza and two steps behind Metro. It's all right. But the staff here is incredible. I value customer service #1, and I dare say that Cici's Pizza on Trop & Eastern, of all places, has the best customer service I've experienced in town. Keep up the good work, and we'll keep dropping by we crave carbs (those cinnamon rolls... mmmm). Cheap as it gets too."}
{"text":"This is the third time we've been here at this location. This is also the the busiest that I've seen them. The staff did good with keeping up with the crowd. And the pizza was fresh just had to wait a little bit. We order a pizza to go, so now we will see the quality of their to go too."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Omg the health department would have a field day with this. You will more than likely get food poisoning from here. They serve cold and old food. It's so dirty on the counters and the floor. The soda machines are nasty. It smells bad in here. Find a different location if you want to eat at cici pizza. This is not the one to go too."}
{"text":"Ever had one of those moments where you want to forget that something ever happened? I just had one of those. It was after eating at CiCi's.  In all of my young adult years, I've never found a reason to complain about pizza. I've had cheap pizza, and higher end pizza. They are what you pay for; and generally, what you expect. CiCi's was a different case, however. Sure, it's a real cheap price for an all you can eat extravaganza, but is it really worth it?   Maybe as a kid I wouldn't mind this place. Heck, as a kid, anything pizza-related sounded good to me. Combine two awesome foods, like mac & cheese and pizza? That sounds like a childhood fantasy. But, when actually having that cardboard slice of pizza with macaroni & cheese thrown on top was like I dumpster dived for a slice of pizza and found mac & cheese residue on top. The pizza didn't taste good, nor did the mac & cheese. Combine the two and you get an exponential amount of awful.  Sure they have the normal pizza with the traditional toppings. Thing is, they taste similar to pizza that sat out in a drunken dorm room for about a week, maybe worse. Then they also have the crazy combination pizzas, like the mac & cheese or one with Taco Bell style toppings thrown on top, which make absolutely no sense at all. Putting such low quality food and combinations made my taste buds weep tears of sadness. That night, I wouldn't be surprised if half of my taste buds shut down on me in sheer disappointment, forever leaving me with the palate of a senior citizen.  Yes, the place was all-you-can eat. All I was able to handle was 1.5 slices. It was after that, I was done and walked out.   Never again, I said to myself. Never again."}
{"text":"Excellent concept with very poor execution.  I was very excited to try CiCis for the first time and I came to this location with a veteran who has visited numerous other locations and thinks CiCi's is wonderful.  Very poor management at this location, or perhaps I should say lack of management as I never saw a manager.  This restaurant is so dirty.  There was one very sad looking girl who never stopped working but had no chance of keeping up with cleaning the lobby.  The spatulas used to serve the very cold pizzas were also dirty.  When I asked for a clean one the employee told me the ones out were fine but did eventually give me one when pressed."}
{"text":"Pizza is very thin. Nothing special about the taste. The crust is a bit too doughy. I'm picky when it comes to my pizza but I did enjoy the cheap price. Too bad you can taste it too."}
{"text":"My husband went to the one in San Antonio, so he thought this chain would be good here, too (and I can't tell you how long it's been since he first mentioned it). Enter Easter Sunday, we were headed to Metro but they were closed (darn, I really wanted Metro, my absolute favorite pizza, since college). I thought of Chapala's (but they too were closed, we learned when we went to WalMart later), but we were passing this place, and my husband suggested Cici's.   First off, it's not gourmet pizza, so if you know this, you are not going to expect much. It's along the lines of Little Cesar's (five dollar single topping pizza) or Chuck E Chees. For the buffet, it's $5.49 each. It's super cheap. I hadn't been to a pizza buffet since Pizza Hut's, back in the day. I wasn't at all excited, I thought it was going to be a generic place with so-so food.    As you enter, there are chimes of \"Hello, Welcome to Cici's!\" from the friendly, enthusiastic staff (you will get a hearty greeting when leaving). You pay first. When you get the receipt, the hostess told us that we could do the survey and get the next buffet at $3.99. Also, get the card, because after a few (one stamp per visit), you get one for FREE. You get cups from the host. You choose where you sit. The place is pretty big. From the outside, it looks small. It's clean, too. There were several families having lunch and there is a little game area in the corner. Drink machines are in the back. Salad is the first station, followed by the soup (daily was chicken noodle soup) and pasta section, followed by the pizza section (lots of variety), and finally the dessert station.  Choices of pizza (which are all thin crust, btw) are the following: cheese, florentine (spinach), white, supreme (everything), pepperoni, buffalo chicken (spicy), cheeseburger- had seen this flavor in other pizza joints (my husband's 2nd fave), and macaroni and cheese- never seen this before (my husband's 1st fave). I might be missing a few flavors, but this is what I remember. I tried the cheese- basic, hard to mess up, right?, florentine- very good, white- also, very good, and buffalo chicken- not for me, the spicy sauce was too weird for me (and I normally like weird). Overall, the pizza was pretty good. Lots of selection, and every time there was a fresh baked pie, an employee would almost yell it out. The soup was good, except I was a little hesitant to eat the \"chicken\" because it resembled something like Cup-A-Soup like, so I ate the large twisty noodles and the broth. I didn't touch the pasta so I can't comment on it at all. The salad was pretty good! There were two kinds, so you don't build your own, like other places (Chuck E Chees). The choices of dessert are the following: thin brownie with powdered sugar dusted on  top (very good!), apple pie pizza (very sweet), and a cheesecake like type that my husband loved!   There are not many buffet type places that are NOT located inside a casino nowadays. I used to like Souper Salad but that's now closed (besides it went downhill the last few years too). Sweet Tomatoes is pretty good but it's not anywhere close to our neighborhood. So, I am sure we will be back again, because it's a pretty good value. Of course, my husband felt like he had a carb overload after that meal, haha. It's not like we eat buffets all the time, either. Everything in moderation."}
{"text":"If they only had pizza I'd give it a 3.  You get what you pay for.  Cheap thin crust buffet pizza.  What bumps it up to 4 stars is the cinnamon rolls.  OH MAN.  These things are amazing!  It will probabbly give me a heartattack, but I can eat plate after plate of these things.  Warm and gooey.  So good.  It can get pretty crowded though.  And there are usually lots of kids running around (where are their parents??).  Staff is really friendly though.  Macaroni and cheese pizza isn't too bad actually.  They also make an apple-cobbler pizza thing that is pretty good.  come for the price, stay for the cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"I think the other guy was kinda harsh, this place is kept fairly clean, and you can't be at the price. Ordering to go is the real deal in my eyes, we ordered 6 large custom pizzas, a large order of cheesesticks, and a large order of cinnamon rolls for 42 dollars flat. Perfect for fight night with the friends. They made everything fresh, did not skimp, and had me verify that every single pizza was correct and looked ok. They always have a friendly staff, and are always fairly tidy. Yes the crowd sometimes can be a little off the normal, and the pizza is not always glamorous, but it's very cheap, and top rated for healthy dining in mens health magizine. The manager is a nice guy, we have talked to him a few times before, and he runs a good establishment, and seems to keep the staff in good spirits/ help when needed. I think the guy below kinda shaftd them on the stars so I gave them a extra one. You can have them make you anything you want, but my top 3 favorite pizza's are the deep dish pep., the macaroni, and the buffalo wing / sausage are tied for 3rd. The also have white pizzas that are a healthier option I believe. Overall it's a good plce for a fast easy and cheap meal. I hope you guys enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is \"the worst restaurant\" I have ever been in!!! So dirty and disgusting!!!! There were a lot of people in it, but the type of clientele was not the greatest! But, what tables were empty had not been cleaned! So we had to sit at a dirty table with someone else's plates and drinks all over it, we asked three times for the table to please be cleaned off, to no avail! We just kept getting the words we are short handed! Finally I told them to either clean the table or I am throwing it on the floor, the floor was filthy and gross anyway, the table greasy so was the floor!  The manager finally cleaned the table and had the nerve to tell us we should have sat at a table that was already cleaned! I said we would have if there would have been one but, there were none!!!!!!! I told him perhaps he needs to hire more people! He said he was going to! He did give us a full refund I will say!  The food was awful we did not like it at all it was tasteless and the crust like eating and tasting cardboard!!!!!! Needless to say we will never eat there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting place that I have ever been to. No...not because of the food but from the tables, plates, windows, counters etc...when I tell you everything was dirty I mean everything. If you don't believe me go and see for your self. I had to go through four trays before I found a clean one. I was disappointed in myself after eating there. I would not recommend,and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Customer service here is A-MAY-ZING!  Here the managers are sooo sweet and welcoming! They seriously go the extra mile to make sure you enjoyed your experience! You want a weird pizza? DONE! They do whatever you want, bc they want YOU to be happy! AWESOME! What I love is here you can MAKE YOUR OWN SALAD! You can load that shiz up with jalapenos, bacon bits, or whatever your little heart desires! You can also get a cup of ranch for your buffalo chicken pizza! BOMB!!  I usually only eat the buff chicken pizza, the deep dish pepperoni with white sauce, or the macaroni pizza! They have awesome others though, the Philly cheese steak, cheeseburger, taco, and whatever you could think of!  They also have a good little soda area and a pretty dope game room!  Def child friendly and huge!"}
{"text":"Diarrhea city brehs.  So I swore to never eat here again. When I first moved to Vegas 3 years ago we came and ate here. I got a really upset stomach and was on the pot for quite a while after. Fast forward a year and I go to the one that used to be opened on Charleston and Durango; everything was fine, that place closed so now we go to the one on Cheyenne. Never had any problems with those 2 locations, but here, hell no.   The customer service is really great and the place is not too gross, but its def huge!   If you are constipated and need to release the demons, COME HERE!  YAY?"}
{"text":"I walked in with my beautiful wife, looked at the after lunch crowd at approximately 1:30 in the afternoon.  Looked like about 6 or so guys, all sitting by themselves, all looked like powerlifters.  It was then that I knew everything was gonna be all right.  The girl at the counter was enthusiastic.  The place was physically clean and cool, including the bathroom.  Went down the buffet, no salad for me, and loaded up the plate with pizza and breads.  Once we were eating, my wife said I had to try the cheese bread with pretzel salt.  Pretty stinkin fantastic if I do say so.  Most of the pizzas were very good, not perfect, but very good.  We liked it and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good pizza for price. Service is kinda slow at getting more pizza out when they run out. Friendly atmosphere. Managers seem more interested in there employees then the customers."}
{"text":"Just left Cicis i enjoyed the white spinach flatbread its good. I encountered a worker named Wiley he was very nice, polite man even pulled my chair out for me to sit what a gentleman. Wiley made the visit more enjoyable thank you"}
{"text":"When my husband brought me to Cici's pizza, my first thought was that he was trying to be funny.  I felt like I lost a bet and forgot that eating here was my punishment.  But it was actually nice... I mean for Cici's, you know.  The pizza's were fresh, and being freshly made to order.  We requested to pizzas, and added BBQ wings.  For what Cici's is and the level of expectation I have for them tonight, they hit a homerun.  Even my tea tasted fresh and that is a BIG deal to me, I don't  know.  I am almost embarrassed to say that I enjoyed myself but I did, I really did.    Thank you Cici's.    *Greeted at the door *Ordering was easy *Military discount *Fresh food *clean service area *clean tables and floors  *good tasting hot food *Quick service on requested items *Fresh tea"}
{"text":"I'm being polite with this 2 star rating. Not only have I had better but man oh man.... I'm taking my time to complete a fully executed survey written response for corporate.   My have the mighty have fallen.... 1) Take our order 2) They charge for water and no notice is given 3) They charge a 50cent upcharge for a to-go cup no matter the size. I promise I didn't want or need a 32oz. I just don't trust the plastic cups.  4) Asked for a special order pasta dish which is the only thing that I get whenever I appear at one of these places... New girl has no idea but she was eager to learn.  5) had to ask her manager for the order to be made and he said no 6) she explained things changed they only make such for to-go orders. No worries I'll take an alfredo pizza 7) while waiting for the 1 thing I asked for I notice the cashier does everything with her hands and cuts cucumbers for the salad bar without ever washing her hands. Dude, money is the dirtest thing but everything else to boot.  8) 25 minutes later but the pizza hasn't been called or brought over so I go to ask what the what. will they bring it or will we get it from the bar?  ***** NO one made it ***** The family said let's not wait. I refuse to cook so I'm like eat here or not at all.   Boom! we left. lol  Look, I hate wasting money but when kids are offering to pay you back for what you spent - you know it's bad. It's not just me being overly picky or something.   The water bottles are 25 cents which is more than reasonable but full disclosure should be provided.   The soda flavors are Coke and include Manza & Orange.  So there are somethings that work but overall - Pineville seems to be better.  OUtdoor patio dining available at some point. Large Game Room. Soda flavors that cater to the community and easy parking are all things that work here."}
{"text":"Had a code for a free Adult buffet or large 1-topping pizza. Called in my order and was told it would be ready in 10 min. Went to pick.it up and it was ready, but they had a difficult time printing the receipt and my pizza sat there and got cold. Some pizza good cold but not Cici's it taste like the box after its cold.  Should have demanded a new one, but hell it was free."}
{"text":"Absolutely grotesque. I honestly cannot believe people come back after eating here. Worse than Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Garlic bread is good, brownies and cinnamon rolls :-) or i must say most of the food they serve is good. The thing is most of their pizza don't have a lot of meat but I think they go cheap because of their buffet special which is really cheap for $5.49 for adults. But overall, its good :-) give it a try :-)"}
{"text":"they deliver on what they advertise - cheap pizza for $6!  go right before the rush, and you get fresh cooked pizza out of the oven.    the stuffed crust is ok - it's stuffed!    I ate too much hot cheese topping pizza...so beware the ease of the buffet."}
{"text":"inside of building was a little grungy feeling. The staff was really nice and the food was good. I really like that they had a soup and salad selection because after eating 5 pieces of pizza and not being full i was feeling a little guilty and wanted a healthier option to finish me off. The ice for their drinks is crunchy and small bits to which is my favorite."}
{"text":"I fuck with this spot. The buffalo hot sauce pizzas proly the best pizza here. i also love the cheesy bread, cinnamon rolls, and apple pizza. i went with my girl and its $5.75 per adult, but we didnt get drinks(which are $1.89 w/o tax for regular and $2.29 w/o tax for a large)so it came out to $12.43 including the tax. id definitely recommend it to other people tryna grub on a budget!"}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because I think most folks are grading this against top notch pizza, or regular restaurants so I'm judging them within their weight class :) that being cheap all-you-can-eat buffets.  I'm from California and I've been taunted by the CiCi's commercials on national TV for years now, so finally being in Tempe visiting my girlfriend's sister, I swung by when I was shopping on the 24th of December.  Let's not beat around the bush... you come into CiCi's for the price and relative quality... and now having been, I can say that their variety is better than Round Table buffet's, and frankly it spanks the pizza at other buffets (where it's usually an after thought to appease the kids). Would I eat it again, ABSOLUTELY! Heck, if I could figure out how to finance it, I'd open a chain of them in California!  When I was there I tried at least 10 different pizzas (some so-so, some good, some better than average, but that's more personal taste than anything), their Rustica soup (which I enjoyed) and one of the two salads offered (also decent).  In short, it exceeded what I was expecting and I would definitely go again if I'm in town. Come on folks... answer these questions for yourself...  1. How many under $8 all-you-can-eat places are there? (that includes drink and tax :) 2. How many are stellar? 3. How many are *hitty?  CiCi's on Gilbert Road fits in answer #1 but neither #2 or #3. Mangia!"}
{"text":"First off manager is my fav she makes sure everyone is happy ! And takes care of everyone ! Great food get service loved it"}
{"text":"This place is actually really great if you're on a diet. You're guaranteed to see or smell something that will make you lose your appetite. Need to use the bathroom? You'll have to walk through the back hall which will either smell like a dumpster or vomit.  Shame these places are so filthy. The cheesy garlic bread is actually phenomenal. And I know others who feel the same way about the cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location since it opened. There are other locations in town now that are closer but we still go to this one. They have always been very friendly and lots of choices. My fave pizza is the flat bread spinach, most delicious. I only wish they had Pepsi products instead of coke. We will continue to visit here as long as they remain open even though it is way out of our way."}
{"text":"CiCi's was one of the places I was really excited to go to once I moved to AZ from WA because they always played commercials for them but there aren't actually any restaurants in Washington!  It was smaller than I expected it to be but not having any other comparison I'm not counting that as a bad thing.  The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and made sure we knew what our options were for dining and she gave us her name in case we had any questions.  Pretty good service for a buffet if you ask me.   Being as I had never been to a CiCi's before and that I was really hungry when I went, I tried pretty much everything they had to offer.  I had a couple different types of pizza, both of which were very good I thought.  They had just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The amount of toppings kind of depended on which piece you picked, some had a lot, some had just one or two toppings on the entire piece.  The salad was good as well, I had the pre-made Italian style one.  I liked it, I would have liked to have had croutons either already in the salad or the option to add them but it's not a deal breaker so I got over it.  Moving on to my favorite part...dessert!  I had one of each of the three desserts they had out and I enjoyed all of them.  The brownies were nice and soft and had a good flavor.  The apple crumb pizza thing tasted JUST like apple pie but in a less messy, smaller serving size.  The sticky buns were my favorite though.  They were very light and fluffy and had just the right amount of frosting, not too much that you had a sugar overload but not so little that you feel like you're eating a biscuit.  I left feeling very satisfied with myself for getting good food for such a cheap price and I will definately be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Once again, a report from my niece Emily.   \"It's a good way to eat cheap and to all who love pizza you should try this is XL's  niece  reporting to you for Cici's Pizza\"  OK, here's my input  Pros - CHEAP all you can eat pizza & salad ($5 not including soda). - Tasty. You can order any flavor if they don't have it at the serving area. 1st time I ever tried mac & cheese pizza. You can ask for thin crust. - Reasonable salad selection - Simple but tasty deserts - Fantastic & nice servers - well trained. - Plenty of indoor seating - kid friendly - includes a game area. My niece really ate alot.  Cons - Heard they used to have Alfredo sauce for the pasta - but they didn't have when we visited.  Return Visit - When I return next time."}
{"text":"this place is disgusting. old dry hard pizza. soo thin and i can't believe i actually ate it. i felt bad to ask for a refund. this owner has no pride in this location. pathetic"}
{"text":"Hands down, best Cici's in town. Amazing customer service, all of the employees are full of character and personality."}
{"text":"This place is a pigsty. We walked in around 615pm on 06/02/18. They had no fresh pizzas out. The rest of the pizzas that were out, was rock hard and stale. The girl at the register (Latino girl with glasses) was so rude. At the end of our visit, I put some quarters in their little vending machines. It took the money but didn't give anything out. We told that girl about it who did nothing. Just said we don't have a key. Kept talking about her personal life and acted as if we were not standing there. It's not even about the $1 we lost, she was beyond rude about it."}
{"text":"If I'm not craving for buffet pizza, I'm not going there. This place really like a garbage restaurant, it is really dirty to dine in. Food wise is great for the price, too bad other cleaner Cici's pizza is closed."}
{"text":"This Cici's restaurant is now under new management, same owner.   I am upping my review to 3 stars from 2.  I am hoping to raise my review to 4 stars soon. I have e noticed an improvement in the overall operation of the restaurant, in the time this new manager has learned her job.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The staff must think they're being funny when 3-4 workers YELL: \"Welcome to CiCiiiiIIIIISSSS?\"  So annoying, loud, disrespectful and immature.  You can even hear them laughing afterwards trying to entertain themselves.  I guess that's life as a teenager in the pizza business.  Oh wait, most of them are over 18.  Wow, how pathetic.  They lost 4 stars on being highly obnoxious alone."}
{"text":"This is a cheap place to go for pretty decent all you can eat pizza, pasta, and salad. I have been to many Cici's in the Oklahoma/Texas area and have never been impressed.  I always enjoyed eating there, but they were nothing to write home about. This specific location was clean and the staff was very attentive and very friendly!  The pizza was also quite delicious too! If you are looking for cheap food near the strip for a family or a sport's team, I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 4 stars. This is my third time eating here. Trust me, if I don't like the pizza I don't return. It's not nearly the best pizza I ever had. It's a pizza and pasta buffet for less than $5 a head, what do you expect?  I am tempted to give it only 3 because of my first experience but it's good, inexpensive and a fun place to bring my kids.  It's like a dream come true. I would not recommend take out, but if you sit in and wait for the pizza to come out hot a fresh, it's great!  They also have chicken soup and all types of pizza imaginable. If you are a food snob, don't bother. If you like variety of comfort foods, this is definitely the place to go. Kids love it!"}
{"text":"BEST Value EATS in #Vegas!! @cicispizzavegas $3.99 All-You-Can-Eat Salad,Pizza and Pasta Buffet!!! Celebrating 25 years!!!  A GREAT place to take the kids-CHEAP $2.49 each and there's an arcade plus lots of open cafeteria type seating.  The place keeps the pizzas coming so every time you go up there's a whole new variety of pizzas to choose from. I tried spincah pizza, macaroni+cheese, Veggie,Hawaiian, Traditional meat+cheese. Pasta and breadsticks, salads and cinnamon rolls. plus they have SWEET TEA:)  I'm not gonna tell you this place has the best pizza or even good pizza but you can eat ALOT and the TEA is good and its CHEAP at under $5!!! Gie it a try and decide for yourself ;)"}
{"text":"All-you-can eat pizza buffet & drink for $7.   It is just buffet pizza lots of different variations and you can request any you can imagine-mac n chz,hot dog, pepperoni & jalapeno,hawaiian & more.   There's about 10-12 varieties on the buffet at a time. There's lots of people here so there's usually something new every time back to the buffet.   They also have 2 salads, soup & bread sticks plus 2 desserts and they serve Coca-Cola products.   It's cafeteria-style seat yourself and there is a small arcade and several flat screen TVs.   For buffet pizza this place is OK. BUT for pizza it's crap-No flavor, sauce was weak, thin flavorless crust or thick & doughy, all the toppings were over processed and the cheese was invisible.   Worst yet less than 5 minutes after leaving this place I had the uncontrollable feeling that everything needed to exit my body from one end or the other."}
{"text":"kind of strange this is the only one in town. it's a pizza,pasta & salad buffet. all you can eat for under $6!!  the pizza is unusual like somebody is in the back just randomly throw stuff on pizza. the mac & cheese was surprisingly good. believe it or not-the best thin & crispy taco pizza i've had in vegas. the pizzas were pretty decent for buffet pizza. the salads were fresh & crisp and the pasta was pretty good too. just spaghetti & lasagna. for eating cheap this may be the best value around town. but for quality it's just ok. the place was very clean. the help was friendly and the buffet had fresh stuff every time i went back(like 4-5 times). self-serve drinks & ice cream too.  if you are feeding a family it's better than the drive-thru & cheaper"}
{"text":"Stopped in just to check it out since it's been years since I've been to one. The first thing i noticed was the unkept buffet.  Dirty bowls sitting there, sauce all over, dirty seats etc. While paying at cashier i noticed they kept pizzas under The buffet counter un covered. My guess is that those are to replenish The buffet.  They were nearly touching the ground!    The salad was good,  pasta was ok,  and pizza was pretty tasteless. There was a couple waiting for a pizza they special ordered but it never came out and when they asked manager they said they didn't know when it would be ready  so they left.  I would recommend coming here only if it's the last place open or if u are absolutly craving a buffet."}
{"text":"CiCi's pizza is awesome! It has a buffet of pizzas, excellent soup, and salad! Then it includes a delicious dessert, with brownie cake,  cinnamon buns, and apple pie pizza.  Overall, CiCi's pizza should get 100 stars, from its quality of food."}
{"text":"Good food and pretty fast service. But the place smells pretty gross, almost like someone took a dump in ceiling and they never cleaned it out. Floors usually sticky, and tables sticky as well. Dirty plates and glasses for use. Only giving 3 stars because the food is good for take out"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. they take special requests and the staff is very friendly. they do a mac n cheese pizza (yeah i know it sounds kinda weird) that is surprisingly good. pizza selection is good, thin crust, deep dish, veggie and meat are all up. salad bar is a little sparse but adequate. usually three selections for desert, apple/cream cheese pizza, brownies and cinnamon rolls.  if you can snag a couple fresh made cinnamon rolls you will not be disappointed. only drawback is they have coke products but they have tea. coupons abound, you will get an offer on the back of the receipt."}
{"text":"This is probably the best overall Cici's that I've ever been to.  Although that isn't saying much, but overall the atmosphere was pretty relax.  I guess I can only compare this to the Cici's I used to go to on rainbow.  When I went it was kind of crowded but the size of the establishment was pretty big so no one was really crammed together.  Of course for $6 all you can eat pizza there is nothing to complain about that.  Average food, I love pizza so quality isn't that much of a factor for me.  I do like how they announce that a new fresh pizza is available.  If you are in the area and want to stuff your face with pizza, check it out.  Conditions For Me To Return: - Get dragged here by the girlfriend   Seriously, I don't live in this area, that's the only condition."}
{"text":"Cici's isn't the best pizza around but it's not really bad either.   For a pizza buffet, it's actually decent.  They are constantly making pies and if you see something that is missing, they will gladly make one for you.    In addition to the pizza selection, there is a small salad bar, a pasta bar, soups, and the dessert bar.  The staff is friendly here, the restaurant is relatively clean and if you beat the rush of kids, it can be relatively quiet."}
{"text":"Dirtiest place in Brooklyn hands down. Makes a dumpster out back more appealing to eat out of. Tables are never cleaned, plates and silverware usually have leftover food on them. There is always pop spilled everywhere near the machine and the bathroom quite literally smells like your local dump. Staff is friendly, but I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't insects and rodents all throughout the restaurant due to huge lack of cleaning and hygiene. It's a shame they let a place get this bad, it use to never be like this."}
{"text":"Love this place I come here with my family all the time when were in town..... the pizza is good here I'll be back in 3 day  b4 we go home."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely filthy, food scraps on the floor, tables badly wiped so scraps of food left even after cleaning. The drinks are smells of urine. Never again - Manager please clean up. Little to no meat on the pizza\"s!!!!"}
{"text":"Took our football team to eat here after their game and a Roach was crawling on the table....I will never eat here again...it was also roaches in the men's bathroom..."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of cici's but I took my daughter and cousin last Wednesday a 5 and 6 year old who likes pepperoni can't get better than cici's. I ordered me wings, I was told it would take 12 minutes so we had been there about 20 the girls had ate their way through a couple of plates of pepperoni. I finally asked about my wings, it was really busy this night right before Christmas a bunch of kids on vacation I got it. Finally about 30 or so minutes later I was told the cook forgot my wings, I wondered how was that possible? But just figured don't fuss ask for my money back let them eat more pepperoni and move on. So sure enough I was given my money back for my wings and my daughters meal. We had been there about an hour and the wings were finally done she gave them to me any way, I thought that was sweet even though she didn't have to plus she gave me my money back. So moral is even though I personally don't like cici's's pizza, the staff at this location are very nice considerate people who went over board to make sure my visit at cici's didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Noisey. Dirty, food on floor. Doesn't look like floor swept all day & it's 7PM. Not much in way of foid on the buffet line. Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"My kids love this place with the different varieties of pizza and desserts, great customer service, always clean, the busses who picks up plates etc is always polite and cheerful"}
{"text":"This is a terrible place to eat from a health perspective. If you want to eat carbs and fat, you've found your stop."}
{"text":"The good news is they seem to be accommodating to mothers of children with autism.  My sister won't go to the location closest to her home because of a rude manager who would not be accommodating to my autistic nephew.  Not sure I can eat this pizza as a NYer used to a higher standard.  If you were looking for NY pizza, this isn't it.  The sauce is sweeter than I'm used to.  However, I like that they will make you a small pan pizza of whatever kind you like if they don't have it on the buffet line.  The salad was good as well as their dessert pizza and brownies.  I had a LOT to eat so I definitely didn't leave town starving; my niece even snatched up the part of my brownie I couldn't eat and she seemed happy with it.  There's also a game room in the very back."}
{"text":"For $6 to get all of the pizza you can eat. You can have any kind of pizza you can dream up using the toppings they have. That being said it's not really quality your getting here, just quantity, as much quantity as you want."}
{"text":"Its CiCis, and its Mesa. When you go here, your standards cant be too high.   We walked in and paid, and immediately noticed the dirty salad bar. Oh what the heck, skip the salad and head to the pasta. Nope, pasta was soggy and gross.  Got to the pizza, which had like no selection, so I asked if I could order a few specials. The woman, Esmerelda, was very rude and told me she was busy so I would have to wait to order. No rush, cool, I waited. Literally ten minutes later she finally took my requests.  Well thats not completely true. She refused to make a macaroni pizza because it goes on the buffet. Yet there was none on the buffet. Asked for a stuffed crust with no meat (we are vegetarians), and she said she couldnt make it without some type of meat. Ummm are you serious?  So not only did the selection suck, the salad and pasta were disgustingly dirty, and Esmerelda was rude.  The manager was nice, but like I said it's a buffet in Mesa, you really cant be setting your sights too high before walking in."}
{"text":"This is the only location I've ever been to, and it happens to be right across from my house, so we are able to walk there. The value of this place is great. My husband and I have two children under 4, so for the four of us to eat it costs us less than 20 dollars, which is why we keep going back. We don't go out often, but when we do Cici's is a favorite.   The food is okay. It is not the best pizza I have ever had, by far, but for the price I don't expect it to be. I have had some pretty decent slices of pizza here, and some that were ehhhh. It depends on how fresh they are. They do offer a good variety of types and flavors of pizza, and they will make custom orders by request. They have a basic salad bar, which I enjoy, and their dessert items are pretty good. Overall it's a decent and filling place for lunch or dinner, which is super budget friendly.   What I love most about this place is the staff. Everyone that we've encountered that works here has been very courteous and friendly. There is one manager who works here, who happens to always remember me by my clothing when we come in, and she is incredibly sweet and friendly. Unfortunately I haven't caught her name.  They keep the restaurant clean, and it's bright,  and completely kid friendly."}
{"text":"Who is a fan of a cheap ol' pizza place like you would think Cici's is?? Me! Seriously this place blows my mind. Between the excellent service and attitude's of the employees here and the nice variety of pizza they service... this place is awesome!   This is the first time I've had a macaroni pizza, a dessert pizza, and you can pretty much order anything the imagination can think of. They have a lunch special for $4 for all the soup, salad, dessert and pizza you can eat. If they don't have the pizza there you want... ask them! they'll make one special for you. Amazing! and for the price?! Amazing!"}
{"text":"great customer service from the manager and bus boy:) the food is always fresh and delicious. we live the bbq pork pizza !! omg' soo good! the price is affordable i recommend it"}
{"text":"The place was a little dirty. There was no pizza on the buffet line when we arrived. Shortly after they put pizza out and it was good but the people there were loud and the place itself was ghetto."}
{"text":"I am ashamed of how much I used to frequent CiCi's. Yes they knew me by name and yes they would bring us a cheese pizza every time we were there. & boy did I have the coupons to boot! I think on average I paid $2.50 each trip.  I think their salad is delicious, it's comparable to Olive Garden. TOOOOO many black olives, but hey what can you do?!  Oh I do not miss watching Veggie Tale previews over and over and over."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here after dropping someone off at the airport and heading back home.  The kids, for the most part, enjoyed the pizza; however, the reviews that compare this restaurant to a dumpster are not lying.  Even though the price is cheap, we still deserve a clean place to eat.  The restaurant is disturbingly disgusting.  The workers were mopping up messes, but the mop water smelled putrid. I felt so bad for taking my kids there. I will give the restaurant an extra star because the people that work there were friendly and doing their best to keep up with the throngs of people. Still, no other word but disgusting.  I made the kids take their shoes off even before getting into the car because the floor looked THAT disgusting."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Cici's you use to be really good! Your food quality has gone down substantially over the past few years, and your image is lackluster. From the dirty-grimmy buffet area with food and pizza pieces all over the buffet and floor, a filthy ugly oven that needs a good cleaning! to the dirty soda machine, filthy carpet and rocking tables, to the ugly walls, to the workers lazily putting SOUP in the oven and then re-filling it... I mean I could go on and on! And $9.50 per person is super over priced! I could go to a casino buffet and pay the same to have an even better experience! If u don't mind the smell of little kids farting and screaming at the top of their lungs, and eating in a filthy-dirty establishment with raw pizza and disgusting food..then come to Cici's!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the most amazing Pizza in Vegas you aren't going to find it here. However, this would be an awesome place to take your kid for lunch or dinner. Its a buffet style pizza place (if you can call it pizza) with an arcade and a little room to run around. The price is great $4.99 for lunch, are you kidding me? I would totally come back when I have friends in town and we are looking for a cheap, fun place to feed the kids and have a little grown up time while the kids play... but you won't find me here otherwise."}
{"text":"seriously disgusting .. when I am paying 5 dollars for AYCA pizza I don't expect a 5 star experience by any means .. honestly, we have been here in the past when we wanted something cheap & easy & it was not bad .. again, for 5 dollars for all you want .. NEVER AGAIN .. on my last & FINAL visit this place was totally filthy .. granted it was crowded but the inside of this place looked like a dumpster .. the ice machine was empty & I could see why .. kids were running around everywhere grabbing more & more soda & what was left of the ice was on the ice machine under the dispenser in a huge pile that just kept melting & dropping ice on the floor .. the 1st 5 forks I pulled out were either dirty or bent .. no knives available .. the pizza selection was not as good as it usually is but tasted as I expected for 5 dollars .. when someone finally saw it was time to clean tables off the person that came around was just as filthy as the rest of the place .. uniform caked w/what looked like days of old food & the cart he was using was not fit for the inside of a restaurant busy w/diners .. there were also clear containers on it filled w/liquids w/food floating around that looked like the inside of a toilet .. a very dirty toilet .. gross .. so again, granted it is 5 dollars but I won't spend that much to eat here ever again"}
{"text":"Every time i go to Vegas i always have to make a few stops here before i leave Vegas. I think it's one of the best cheapest buffets i been too, if you love pizza. my Fav is the macaroni pizza.   They also provide salads, soup, and dessert. NO ICE CREAM THOUGH!   They have a little arcade for kids and about 2 TVs usually one TV has sports on and the other cartoons."}
{"text":"As Yelp puts it - A-OK is what Cicis is. For the price, it's a steal. But in terms of quality, you really get what you pay for.  Cici's reminds me of a cheaper priced Shakey's lunch buffet.. with less items. The restaurant is large and comes with a small arcade for kids (or those kids at heart). You walk in, pay, and seat yourself anywhere there's an open table. The table we chose was a bit sticky, but the staff here were very nice about cleaning it up as they saw us about to move tables.   The pizza variety is impressive. You have square pizza, flatbread, and even some fun choices like mac and cheese pizza. The garlic bread is also fairly good. Contrasting the large variety of pizza, the salad bar leaves a lot to be desired. They have basic choices like lettuce, mixed greens with toppings such as croutons, carrots, cucumbers, etc. but nothing much beyond very basic salad options. The soups were just alright, nothing special to note.  Overall, really good place for the price. You aren't going to get the best tasting pizza in the world - but a pizza, pasta, salad buffet for about $6 per person? Worth it."}
{"text":"I been here twice. For 3.99 all you can eat pizza it's not that bad.  I special order a deep dish pizza and it's my favorite. There is a taco pizza thin crust with shredded beef, lettuce and taco sauce that is yummy as well.  If your looking for high quality pizza, your at the wrong place. If your looking for a quick bite that is very cheap, then your in the right place!"}
{"text":"I would give a 0 if that was an option! Visited the store today at 5:01pm. The staff there is very unfriendly and unhelpful. When asked a question on how long the limited lemon creme would take they told me that they would need to ask the manager because it was still incomplete. After 4 employees going back and forth on who would ask him, I told them since no one could decide on who was going to assist me, I'd do it myself. The manager \"Josh\" (if that is his real name because no one wears name tags) was rude and walked away several time in the middle of me informing him on what his employees were telling guest about the desert. He stated that if I wanted to wait 3 hrs for the desert they could make it and walked away. After the last time he walked away, I asked the female employee who was taking the pizza out of the oven what his name was she laughed and said Josh. At this point after paying $30+ to eat at this location, I asked the cashier for a pen and asked to confirm the managers name. She put her hands up and said I don't know, I'm not in this.I had enough of being mocked and laughed at by these rude employees and my family left. Walking out the door they made a point to say have a good day and laughed. I will never return to this location again!  Higher management need to train their employees to be respectful to the paying guest that is paying their pay checks!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price. But what made the difference for me was Wiley. He was enthusiastic, loving, helpful. Employee of the year I have to say."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Salad could have been better if I wanted ranch that tasted like hidden valley I would of ate at home and the pizza was ok but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Granted it is a Sunday evening and it can be a bit busy but the food was bland and scarce for a CiCi's...the women's restroom was DISGUSTING but when I told the manager she seemed caring apologized and sent someone right then to go clean it... we didnt stick around to find out how that turned out but in the future I would rather drive across town to a different CiCis than return here!"}
{"text":"My first experience at CiCi's pizza was very good. After reading  mixed reviews, I was pleasantly suprised.  Me and my roommate went in for lunch Sat 3/7/15. For the two of us, 2 buffets and 2 large drinks came to $17.    The place has a family atmosphere and there is also an arcade area. There are tv's around, and on that particular day they had on a soccer game.    There is a salad area, a soup area, and the pizza area. I noticed that the pizzas were always well stocked. The soups weren't anything special- clam chowder and chicken noodle mostly broth but I prefer that anyways. The salad bar had no cheese, and only iceberg lettuce. But they did have mushrooms. And their signature Italian dressing tasted similar to Olive Garden!  As far as the Pizza, I really enjoyed it. I thought the sauce was excellent, and it was fresh.  There was a lot of cheese and various toppings. One very cool thing is that you can request a pizza to be made to order. My roommate really liked that--he even got a Pan crust! I posted a picture of it.   Also the drink station has sweet and unsweetened tea. The ice is crushed.  Would I return? Yes absolutely. It's a damn good price and I mean the food is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"There is a young black gentleman that works here, and I just want to say what an amazing asset he is to this company! Cicis is lucky to have him working for them. He is SO polite, always greats us with a smile and warm welcome. He has a positive attitude no matter what and always looks happy to be at work. Tonight I said hello to him as always and asked him how his night was, he followed me to the table and pulled my chair out for me to sit down and wished my family and I a happy holidays! He is such a hard worker and deserves to be recognized for just being him all the time, happy, funny, and positive ! I hope this review reaches someone in management"}
{"text":"Good pizza at a great price (under $6 with tax for the buffet + drink). The employees are incredibly friendly and enthusiastic (some might say too much). I've been there twice now and it's been good both times."}
{"text":"Just like any other cicis, the quality isn't all that great, but the price is right. $5.99 with a water. Cokes are $1.89 I think."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 63/100  Not too big a fan of pizza buffets but this place is one of nostalgic value to me and one of my good friends. Plus, $5 for a buffet isn't bad at all. Since she's leaving Vegas away for good, we thought it'd be great to give this place a go for old time's sake.   My favorite was the pork with tangy barbeque sauce and shredded cheese pizza. It was probably the most sought after too, because whenever I went for a round of it, a new serving was placed - hot from the oven. That and the spinach with creamy alfredo pizza. For dessert, my friend and I munched on a few brownies and called it a day."}
{"text":"To celebrate the end of spring semester, my galpal took me here for lunch today and honestly, the last thing I was expecting was for this pizzeria to be a buffet place on top of it. She turned in a one time payment of $15 for the both of us - shoutout to Lolo, thanks for the treat! - and I was led to a neat little restaurant with a whole aisle of pizzas, salads and desserts waiting on the left and televisions hung up on the walls playing pokemon.   We had a great time chit-chatting, occasionally walking back to the aisle for some second/third/fourth? helpings, not to mention the free - and speedy - wi-fi! And when you think you couldn't handle anymore pizza, they've got condensed milk crispified into pizza bread for dessert, and brownies of course! Talk about delish.   Just a note to keep in mind though, don't expect anything fancy schmancy with their pizza variety. Picture the standards - four cheese, spinach and cheese, hawaiian, pepperonni etc. and if that sounds good enough (I promise you, it is) dig in! You'll be stuffed!"}
{"text":"this location is horrible it is so nasty in there, i told the girl behind the salad bar that there was food from the salad bar everywhere and cross contaminating each other and was all on the floor she told me YEAH I KNOW IT HAPPENS  ALL THE TIME she didn't attempt to clean the food UP or  the matter off the floor, now mind you the salad bar is in clear sight when you first walk into the door of the  restaurant, the table are always dirty, you have ask someone to come and clean then, before you sit down and every time I have came into cici's  it  BEEN the same way  SO UNACCEPTABLE"}
{"text":"They have decent pizza and wings. I've been here on two occasions and everything was good. Today when we went in to go pay using gift cards we received, they didn't accept them as payment. We drove a long way to come here and was a waste of our time and gas. Will never come here again!"}
{"text":"the boyfriend and i were so excited to go to vegas for valentines day weekend. i booked the hotel and he confirmed that he made reservations for dinner on opentable at ... cici's pizza.  ha yeah right! nonetheless we still really wanted to try it out after seeing all the commercials. we rushed inside, got in line, and found that there were no salad plates. he went all the way to the back and got us plates, and i thought i could reclaim my rightful place in line. apparently not so much, because this little girl kept shoving her tray in my face and her father told her \"honey watch out, this lady has no concept of what a LINE is\" ...ugh!   i skulked to the back of the line seething, and finally got some facetime with the goods. we were behind another little kid who kept touching everything, taking only the food that was left pristine on the spatula. talk about a health hazard.  the pizza is like what you'd get at any other buffet, the only real standout was that mac & cheese pizza (whoever thought of that is a genius!!). everything else did not live up to the hype. you know it's bad when even the pepperoni pizza isn't good!! their cinnamon rolls and brownies were ok, but i could make way better ones at home.  as we sat down to our dismal meals, the crowd around us really nailed the coffin shut. there was a pair of big guys a few tables down who literally took the rest of the mac & cheese pizza we took our slices from, folded it up and inhaled it down. talk about no shame....we couldn't stop making fun of his plumber's crack, completely on display for all the little kids to see.  i would have been generous and given 2 stars, but the atmosphere really killed it. i love cheap eats all the way, but this was just low class. plus it made my boyfriend sick for the rest of the evening. wouldn't even bother trying it again."}
{"text":"kids loved it,  pizza was great, fresh,  new stuffed crust pizza is really good !!"}
{"text":"First time at a cici's restaurant and this place is a dump it has this nasty stench this place is too dirty I usually look at the yelp reviews before going to a new place idk why I didn't look at this one ?"}
{"text":"Imagine that it's been almost two and a half years since I wrote my original review here.  Man I'm getting old.  Luckily not much has changed.  The prices have gone up a bit, so if you get two adults and two kids (even if the kids have to sneak in to get the kids price, which is now for under-10 only), you'll pay upwards of $30.  That's if you get soft drinks.  If you get water, it'll be closer to $20.  Talk about pricey drinks.  The pizzas haven't changed much, except they go for some variety now - rather than standard pepperoni and sausage, you get barbecue, buffalo chicken and even taco pizzas.  But there is still pasta (usually in a pretty decrepit state), salad and the ever-present dessert pizza.  Though our kids are getting to the point where they like to experiment with their pizza, and get something other than cheese and pepperoni, they like CiCi's because they can get lots of different kinds.  It is what it is.  Don't pretend that you're getting real pizza, but for the family, it's fine.  They also have pretty decent (read: really syrupy, sweet goodness) sweet tea."}
{"text":"For those of you without kids, I get that Cici's is probably not your cup of tea.  Even those with kids may not want to brave the place.  But for a relatively small investment, you get a decent pizza, and they are made just a few feet away.  Perhaps most important is not that the quality is excellent, because they are not the best pizza in the world, but that they get a solid variety on the buffet.  There are a handful of other pizza buffets in town, but they have somewhere between 3 and 5 pizzas out at any given time.  At Cici's, they usually have closer to a dozen, and that does not include the dessert pizzas.  They also include pasta (though it often looks pretty nasty), a cheese bread, and a smallish salad bar, and once the kids - or the rest of the family - is done, they can head off to the arcade, watch television or just annoy other families, which is generally acceptable practice here, unlike at most other restaurants."}
{"text":"Normally we'd go to CiCi's in Matthews (and I've even reviewed them before, if memory serves).  But lately we've been in the University Area more often, which means we're checking out a different location.  It used to be that this particular franchise looked a lot different from Matthews, but over time, the Matthews location seems to have been cleaned up with a different look, so I'm thinking that the Matthews location was either purchased by the same franchisee, or was told to bring itself up to certain standards.  In any case, the University CiCi's is a bit nicer overall, with a single buffet line, instead of two, and the decor is nicer too.  Also, the staff is generally a lot more friendly than in Matthews - rather than just yelling out the typically CiCi's greetings, and sounding like they are getting through their shift, they are actually interested in your well-being.  Or they seem like they are anyway.  The pizza itself is about the same, but the major different here is that if you don't see what you like - or even if you seem to be having trouble finding something - the staff will offer to make something up and bring it out to you.  This is something that all CiCi's will do, but generally you have to ask for it, and the University CiCi's goes out of their way to do it.  Big thumbs up for that."}
{"text":"Ah... the pizza buffet.  Is there a more noble goal on earth, especially for families with young 'uns?  Well, you could hope for a pizza buffet with good pizza, perhaps, but other than that, I mean.  We actually stopped here because we were in the area due to another engagement, and trying to feed a gaggle of kids isn't easy.  Lots of (relatively) cheap pizza is a good idea.  Unfortunately, finding the place isn't simple.  It's tucked around the back of one side of the strip mall, and this center is both packed and cursed with a nasty parking lot (and we were unable to find Cici's on the sign out front).  We had to call to figure out where they were located.  Once inside, we found that while most locations in Charlotte are generally fairly unimpressed with Cici's, Gastonians love Cici's.  They were packed.  As in line out the door packed.  And the buffet was generally kept barely stocked.  Once in the door  you had to scope out a potential table (not easy with a party of 10) and once seated you had to watch for pizza being put on the buffet and make a run for it.  Still, it's a nice option if you have a lot of kids to feed."}
{"text":"Service is superb. Food is excellent and made to order as requested. Wiley is amazing, how lucky this business is to have such a wonderful employee. He greets customers as they come in, is very attentive to any needs we had and even pushed my chair in as I sat down, he even opened the door for us as we left, he's such a gentleman. I will definitely dine here every time I'm here in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. When my niece told us her high school volleyball team was having a fundraiser at Cici's Pizza I cringed. Really? Cici's? But you have to support the kids so I went, expecting the worst only to be pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly with no attitude, the prices were good, and the place was clean. And even with the place being packed with hungry teenage girls on top of the regular crowd the pizzas were hot, fresh, and pretty good with more variety than any of us expected! And the buffet didn't have empty spaces...if they ran low on a pizza they barked out orders to the back for more and they kept them coming!   The fountain drinks were strong, the game room was active, even the restrooms were clean, but the most important thing is the kids had fun. Oh and Cici's made it easy for the team to raise money without fuss. It's not Grimaldi's or an artisan pizza place so I won't give that coveted 5th star, but if you have kids you won't go wrong here. My 2 year old would give it 5 stars...he cleaned his plate. (And as parents we all know how rare that can be!)"}
{"text":"When is Yelp going to let us give zero stars? This place is an absolute joke. Don't bother getting blue cheese dressing for you salad because the sorry excuse for a dressing doesn't come out. Lord forbid you try to squeeze some because it shoots out the side and the \"employee\" at the cash register will tell you \"and that's why you don't squeeze .\" An older employee walked up and asked if I needed more ranch and I told her no I wanted blue cheese but it wasn't coming out. She says ok and continued talking to another employee.  Apparently they were out of dough to make personal pizzas and home girl whose worked there 7 months (she informed us of this) said it would be about 2 hours before it was ready. The salad was eh. The choice of pizzas hilarious. Filthy. Basically saw one guy working hard and bussing tables."}
{"text":"We I'm here at CiCi's pizza with the family this evening. We enjoy coming here for dinner once or twice a month. The food is pretty good but best of all you can feed a family of Six for under $30.00. That's a great savings back in my pocket."}
{"text":"Worst pizza chain EVER!  We went here not by choice but for a fund raiser. Otherwise I would never have eaten here. Don't let the commercials for this chain fool you, the food is the worst! The only two redeeming values of this place were the nice employees and the brownies. The salad bar had a lot to be desired. Two large metal bowls with cut up lettuce and dressing on them. I wound up having three or four plates since it was the only decent thing to eat. The pasta was the most disgusting institutional food I have ever eaten. It came from a can and it tasted like it. One bite was enough. I spit it out. There are many different styles of pizza displayed for you to choose, but don't waste your time eating them. They are extremely thin and chewy! No flavor and very cheap ingredients. I had the cheese only and I gave up on it after two slices. Don't waste your money here. If you want good pizza, go to NYPD Pizza, Streets of New York or one of the other classic style, high quality pizza places. Always keep in mind that if it has \"buffet\" anywhere in the name, it probably sucks!"}
{"text":"I give this place absolutely zero stars. The only reason I even rated it with one star, was because I couldn't post a review without a rating. The food is disgusting, The place is dirty, even when grabbing a fork I couldn't find one that wasn't greasy. I took about three bites of a slice of pizza and immediately went back up to the counter and asked for a full refund. The manager wasn't nice, was not the slightest bit polite. The only nice thing I really have to say about this restaurant was that when I walked in someone greeted me and said welcome to cicis pizza, however he did not have a smile on his face. Do yourself a favor and don't bother even coming."}
{"text":"This pizza spot is ALL you can eat for $5 bucks plus salad. A few flaws 1)They don't keep the tables clean(be ready to have a stack of plates at the end of your table). 2)They are a little slow bring out new pizza   and salad. 3)They run out of napkins and silverware."}
{"text":"I've read through a lot of reviews. Honestly it must be hard to run a buffet because some people will eat loads of food and leave stuffed, only to wake up in pain. Over the years I've learned to eat dinner portions, like I would at any restaurant, and not to let my eyes get the better of me. Trust me, there is a lot of selection and much of it is very good. If you go during lunch or dinner hours, the food is piping hot and super fresh. If you go during the off hours, ask for them to make you a pizza. They will often bring it to the table free of charge!  There isn't a whole lot not to love here. Sure the environment has seen better days but this place gets a lot of traffic.  I like the fact I can make a large salad and top it off with pizza. They have an A rating with me and my family."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star rating for Wiley! This guy is awesome I've only been here a couple times but he is always here and walks me to my seat and pulls my chair out and talks to me about how wonderful his day is. He makes me feel like a princess his smile is contagious and I just want to thank Cicis for employing such a great young man."}
{"text":"I came here looking for terrible pizza. No, I'm kidding. I was craving pizza and I couldn't decide on a topping, so I decided to get them all.  I wanted to use the remaining balance on my gift card but the cashier nor her 2 helpers could figure out how to do a partial payment. They tried really hard and was super nice the whole 3 minutes but they failed to figure it out. Not a big deal though. I had cash.  The restaurant and the worker were both very clean. I like when the workers constantly clean and make the pizza look presentable. It makes me feel like I'm not going to get food poisoning. The workers in the back would organize the pizza and the pizza slice servers every couple minutes.  The pizzas were pretty good. They kept them hot and fresh. There were only a few out though, I think because there were only 5 or 6 tables of customers. Either way, I ordered a custom pizza. They lady was really helpful and friendly when she took my order. It came out after a few minutes and it was good.  They were all very helpful and friendly now that I think about it. Even the lady that cleaned the table was nice. She didn't just pick up plates. She asked me if I was done with anything. I like her technique because I hate when I put something to the side and go back for it and it's missing.  The water was cold and delicious. It tasted so fresh. It tasted better than bottled water. I'm sure they have nothing to do with it, but for the record, they have the best tasting water I've had since coming to Vegas. It taste nothing like watered down Sprite or Pink Lemonade nor did it taste like a pool. Most places have one of those scenario.  Lastly, the brownies were ok. I like the fact that they were not really gooey and mushy like most Cici's. They were decent, except they were not warm. They were just there. Nothing much more special.  Also, I wish that I could take the unfinished pizza I ordered to go. I hate wasting food and the pizza isn't 1 or 2 slices. It's rather large. It's a little bigger than a personal. If you order a pizza, order it before you start eating. It's hard to finish if your already on the edge of bursting!  I added this place to my \"I will return\" list."}
{"text":"For $6 you can't complain. The price includes a FREE drink (for seniors).  MUCH better than Roundtable Pizza, with the word \"pizza\" being questionable.  The flat bread pizzas weren't bad with Chicken Parm flatbread pizza being pretty good along with another flatbread pizza which had a balsamic drizzle. I have no idea what that was!  The macaroni and cheese pizza was brought out as we were leaving.   The two female managers were very nice and NO attitude like the store in Carlstadt NJ, near where Iused to live that had closed shortly after it opened.    The small salad bar was decent as well.  I would never go back to Roundtable but I would go back to CiCis even though the customers were the Wal-Mart(s) abd Megabus crowd.  And instead of saying WELCOME TO MOES when you enter, the say CI CI YOU LATER when you leave!!   3 Stars for halfway decent, far from real pizza."}
{"text":"My family visited this location a few months ago. They had a nice selection of pizza. Everyone got what they liked. I wasn't happy with how long it took for them to clean off the tables after people had left. Also, one of the other guests put pizza on their plate, walked away and then put it back... I think that someone should be paying more attention to who is actually touching the pizza and not taking it."}
{"text":"This place was ok at best. The staff seemed as if they were inconvenience most the time. Manager was outside talking to some friends as we waited twenty minutes to get change for two dollars in quarters. The place had no way to access money via atm for cash to purchase tokens for the kids to play the limited games they have. The desserts for the kids were basically on the counter behind the buffet. Overall two stars and that's pushing it on this first visit...."}
{"text":"Went there the other night, and had to move tables because it smelled so bad. The place was ok, but smelled like they do not clean very good. It did not look dirty, but smelled horrible in some areas. When we moved toward the front it was not unbearable, but I could not wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Did you say pizza buffet.  I came here because my mother has nagged that she wanted to go. I finally decided to take her yesterday 1/30/13. My sister and her 2 children went along as well.   We had buy one get one free coupons. Well as soon as we walked in I asked how much for my daughter Natalie, it was free for her because she is under 4. I didn't know this at the time.   We went up to the counter to check out the pizza options. I want to give you my favorite ones because they are super delicious, and highly recommend that you give them a whirl.  Buffalo pizza  BBQ pizzas The best  Thin crust   Deep dish  Other than these 4, they are just mehhh regular pizza to me.  What I think is the best part of the experience is that Stephanie the young woman who works there. Was very polite we asked her to make fresh spinach pizza, sure enough she did.  Then my mom asked her to make some weird dessert and sure enough she did.  No hesitation. No questions asked.   She was very upbeat and had a sense of humor. Overall my experience was great. My only downfall was the damn table was lop sided, or un even."}
{"text":"I seen a bit of this that can bring me something to really love to see clean,  the people are friendly; the food seemed to keep coming out in a fast means and the place forsure had the crowd coming in.   I will like to come  back and see what other ways I can make food art and cici it up, I can see it now,  lol, for you can keep on having a different pizza every time, is nice to be able to keep that going; new food every time.... done good stuff you know."}
{"text":"Chatan made the whole experience she was awesome at the door and she made it very quick to get in and out of the what seemed long line the food was amazing and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"First of all anyone who come to cicis for gourmet pizza is at the wrong place. Don't bother coming here.   I consider myself a cicis connoisseur. It is probably my favorite restaurant chain and I've eaten at probably most of them across the country.   This one is always the best. The staff is always very friendly, the Buffett always well stocked and fresh. Their pizza somehow tastes better than the other locations. Plus this is constantly the cleanest I've visited.   Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Still horrible with rude workers. Tried to go again tonight and didn't even make it past the register before I turned around and left. Take the time and drive the 30 miles to the Phoenix location if you have a craving."}
{"text":"Awesome Cici's location!  I live in east Mesa and have tried my best to make the location on Gilbert work, but it's just a crappy Cici's. I started driving the 30 miles to the location from the east valley and will never go back. The staff is so friendly. Reminds me of the Cici's I grew up. The buffet is always fresh and resembles pizza, not the slapped together mess from the Gilbert location.   This location is where it's at. If you're far it's worth the drive for a \"quality\" Cici's experience."}
{"text":"For a nice bit stop by here. If you order and take it home place your order there and wait 10 mins the pizza will be hot and very good.  They do not have soda as 2 liter but hey smiths is right there by cicis  The management is very nice as well as the young lady that rang me up."}
{"text":"I went to Cici's against the advise of my family, since I don't have medical insurance. There is a reason the buffet is only $3.99. The only patrons in the restaurant were a handful of unsuspecting snowbirds. The food bar consisted of a couple of salads, chicken noodle soup, corkscrew pasta, marinara/Alfredo sauce 6 different types of pizza and a brownie desert. Everything tasted very, VERY low quality. I've had pizza out of a vending machine that tasted better than this dump.  I was greeted by the cashier who spoke very loudly as if she were at a protest...and no she wasn't deaf, nor am I...It was kind of weird to say the least. Anyway, the best part of my experience was leaving. Fortunately, I didn't stick around long enough to get anyone to wait on me, because I'd feel horrible not tipping...I just wanted out of this place. The spaghetti sauce was so thin, it makes Ragu taste like Classico. The best part of my meal was leaving. If I could give this place no stars, that would still be higher than what this place deserves. The only thing that tasted of high quality, was the free glass of tap water."}
{"text":"Cici's really upset me this time. The pizza is okay, my kids love the mac n chz pizza. The only reason I personally come is for the ranch salad and brownies. The salad wasn't fresh, very limp and saturated with ranch, and the brownies weren't even cooked through. I used my fork and the brownie turned in to mush. Almost looked like it was batter. So nasty. And disappointing."}
{"text":"Cici's is a buffet-style pizza restaurant for family-style eating. This location has a nice salad bar, fresh, hot pizza, low, low prices, and is nearly always crowded on weekends. I took my twins here tonight, and it was a mob scene.   The help is cheerful and efficient. They know how to keep the food moving and the people moving and the mouths full. With a crowd like the one we saw tonight, it's hard for the bus boys to move through the aisles and clean tables, though. These people hustle!  This is definitely a \"strap on the proverbial feedbag,\" inexpensive, all-you-can-eat restaurant. I'm always sadly amused at the number of exceedingly obese people who frequent this place. Tonight, there seemed to be an inordinate number of flatulent fatties wearing stretch clothing and tattoos, and smelling like they hadn't bathed after afternoon orgies in the hog barn.   The pizza was great, but the ambient odors from the guests were, well, off-putting to say the least! Even my 11-year-olds were grossed out by the egregious display of gluttony and poor hygiene! But, we're all guys, so that didn't stop us from eating.  Hey, at these prices, with such tasty comfort food and no limits, you get all the hungry dregs of humanity. It's a freak show, but we'll be back with the kids.   (I need to get to a real haute cuisine place soon, to recover from this!)"}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers, I have been a consistent visitor of Las Vegas for the past 10 years.  I have been visiting multiple Cici's pizza around LV since they've started franchising out here.  This is the first and only time I have felt inclined to YELP about a Cici's in LV.  This particular location has similar buffet pizza, food, offerings as the other Cici's around town, but what gets it a FIVE STAR rating is the CUSTOMER SERVICE and overall VALUE in my book.  Mike, the store manager and owner, is 2nd to none the most down to earth Cici's employee.  His apprentice, Paige, has found a mentor in Mike that empowers his employees to do whatever it takes to make the store run smoothly and offer the best possible customer experience.  Keep in mind that this pizza buffet is super family friendly and is an amazing value when you want to \"ball-on-a-budget.\"  What I am saying is that you get MUCH more bang for your buck!  Thanks for a great time and a full stomach! :)"}
{"text":"This place is not bad for the price. A group of 20 friends and I ate here and they were on top of their pizzas. What's cool as well is that if you want a pizza that is not on the table you can request and order one.   Eat all you can eat pizza for $7ish (lunch) with a soda. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I give this Cici's location a 4-star because the service and quality of the pizza was great! It was not over the top, but it was worthy of a good rating for sure! I have not been to Cici's in a few years, on my lunch break I decided to give it a try. The place was filled with children as usual and the pizza buffet line was FULL! My favorite is the sweet cinnamon rolls in the dessert section at the end.   If you don't like children or loud atmospheres then Cici's probably isn't the place for you. If you love to create your own pizza and go all out then I suggest you give Cici's a shot!"}
{"text":"Use to love coming here to eat in and take out. Came for a take out order and they dont even have the value pizza meals anymore. So now u got to order each pizza if u want more then 1. Lets not talk about the people that was hanging outside the store. Going in and out with food and drinks. Just a very bad look"}
{"text":"Tonight, I was out running errands near the airport, and I decided to stop into the Tropicana and Eastern location for pizza with my 4 year old. She's very high energy, and she was very hungry.  We were greeted outside by Wiley, a very nice, outgoing, friendly, helpful gentleman. He showed us where to go, and explained how the buffet worked. During our meal, my daughter caught Wiley's attention to ask about the games. Wiley explained to her that the games work, but she must eat her dinner so she'll grow big and strong. Then, a few minutes later, she dropped her soda.  Before I had a chance to get an employee's attention, here comes Wiley to assist.  My daughter kept apologizing and thanking Wiley for helping her clean up her mess. He said not to worry, it's an accident. When we were ready to leave, Wiley showed us which door was the exit. I know that not everyone would appreciate Wiley's enthusiasm, but we definitely appreciate his hard work and dedication, you can really tell he loves his job! Thank you, Wiley! We'll definitely be back to this location because of Wiley!"}
{"text":"The food here is OK.. but the people are really nice and helpful.. love that they do lots of fund raisers with schools. So I usually come here to support the kid's school. Wish they had more variety.. but overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"Now before you question how I can give a place with such cardboard style pizza 5 stars let me explain, I have small children aged 7 and 4. We go here because it's cheap and EASY and lots of fun for my children. I was here for a evening of fun with my kids for $13 I paid for One adult and 3 kids meals.I prefer this location to any of the others because of the great customer service. Everytime I have been to this location everyone has been friendly and eager to help. This past visit was a 5 star one because the girl who was bussing tables was quick and never left a dirty dish on my table for long at all. It was a Saturday night too so it wasn't like the place was empty. Her name was Hailey and she was VERY friendly! another notable worker was their Shift Manager Vernel *sp* he was very nice. He went around to check if everyone was doing all right and when taking my specialized order for pizza he was super friendly! I know some people aren't aware but they will make you ANY type of pizza you want so if you get there and it all looks gross just ask them to make you a fresh pizza with WHATEVER you want on it and they hand deliver the slices to your table. Not to mention children 3 and under are free!!!!"}
{"text":"It's not amazing pizza by any means. But it's all you can eat! The workers are really good about keeping lots of different kinds of pizza available and they'll make custom pizza for you. The cinnamon rolls and brownies are really good and I like their Alfredo sauce too."}
{"text":"Not like the commercials at all. Red crushed pepper was out. The pizza was cold, even the ones just put out. Table was sticky."}
{"text":"DIRTY, Dirty, dirty. Apparently they have NEVER heard of basic cleanliness practices.  The gent washing tables did a reasonable (not great) job but never wiped the soapy water off of the table.  I had to request flatware to be make available. The food was generally fresh and Warm. But definitely not great or even \"real good.\"  BUT what sent me screaming out was the Floor.  I stuck to every tile in there.  The floor around the Soda machine was so sticky you couldn't move.   Really, really BAD."}
{"text":"309 n Nellis Our all time worst dinning experience The tables and floors were dirty If we had not already paid we have walked out The ladies restroom smelled bad Had toilet paper and towels all over the  floor Men restroom was the same No pride in ownership We will never be back Kids left to run wild No stars from me have to give one to post my review"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in years. I remember it was a nice place to eat. Came here tonight and was beyond dissapointed. First things first, the restaurant was so dirty. Food and napkins all over the floor. If I would have seen that before I paid I would never have paid to eat there. In fact, I was tempted to go ask for my refund before we even ate.    The pizza did look good, but that was about it. They kept the pizzas stocked because it was a busy night. The salad bar needed to be kept up more and refreshed to make look appetizing. The dressings where near empty and they splattered everywhere when I squeeze the Italian on my salad. I had to eat my salad with a SPOON! It took 23 minutes for them to put out clean spoons.    The soup was near empty and it didn't look like they were ready to put out a new pot at 6 p.m. The pasta was definitely not appetizing! The pasta itself was full and looked fresh. The Alfredo sauce look like it had been sitting there all day because it was near empty and had dried sauce at the top. I didn't even look at the marinara sauce because I'm sure it was the same.   I wouldn't recommend drinking the iced tea because the taste was so disgusting! Who knows how long they have been trying to serve that tea because it definitely was not fresh. I was forced to drink soda because there was nothing else to drink there. All the sodas were flat and just as bad to drink.    There was a family sitting next to us that asked to see the manager, but apparently the manager was too busy to even take the time to hear what they had to say. I heard them say they would never come back because that place was a nightmare. Any manager that is requested to come out on the floor should promptly come out and tend to their patrons.    I don't completely blame the two people working there that were tending to the tables for the appearance of the restaurant. The manager should be making the rounds during busy hours and overseeing the quality of the restaurant. If the manager would have been on duty, as they should have been, there would have been signs addressing \"Slippery When Wet\" on the floor near the bathrooms and the kitchen. I am not exactly sure why the floor was so wet, because I did not go beyond the door opening of that area. I wasn't sure if it was water from the dishes being brought out or if it was sewage. I only discovered that upon leaving the restaurant when I went to wash my hands.    I think this location should shut down just as the others did years ago. Not worth the money for the overall quality. I'm glad there are other restaurants near where we live because the restaurants near there are just as bad as this location. Maybe the Manager and District Manager should pay them a visit on a Saturday night. I'm sure they will have the same experience!"}
{"text":"Don't come here and think you're gonna get anything fancy..because it's not. It's cheap and for the price it's worth it.    The food is surprisingly good..salad and soup is great. Pizza is also good...there are about 6 different varieties of pizza and they will make you any kind you want if you ask.  For dessert they have cinnamon rolls(delish) brownies..and a apple pie pizza. I have to say I love all of them.   It's great for kids..cheap also. Came for lunch on a weekday..2 adults and 1 kids was under $20."}
{"text":"With the Pizza Hut (which had a buffet) on Boulder Highway closing down, I have been seeking a suitable replacement for my pizza buffet needs. I kept seeing commercials for Cici's, and they finally opened a few locations around town. After going, I think that need has been filled.   The place is, essentially, a pizza buffet with a plethora of other items offered as well. There are all kinds of pizzas prepared different ways with different toppings, pasta, breadsticks, dessert items, and even soup! Seriously, there is a little bit of everything here. Regardless of your tastes you're bound to find an item that works for you.   The place is priced right, too. Their buffet is not overly expensive by any means, making this an ideal place to get a cheap, good lunch if you are in the area and in the mood. I only wish they would put a location in the \"old\" Henderson area, as this is the closest restaurant to me and still a pretty lengthy commute.  If I have one complaint with this place, it is the overcrowding. This place gets JAMMED at peak hours, and even finding table can be a struggle. It doesn't help things that they only have one drink machine, and all the food laid out in one long row. This makes it hard to get around without bumping into someone, which is both annoying and a safety hazard.  But I can overlook the flaws. This place is excellent, and I have no problem making the commute there for my pizza buffet needs. This place gets a strong recommendation."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat pizza and salad place.   Pizza selection is decent. All types of pizza were delicious, light, puffy crust with quality cheese. Made fresh, served fresh. Brownie is baked fresh. Salad bar is small but has all basic items including sunflower seeds and croutons. Pasta bar with delicious pasta soup. Water is free. Play area for kids.  Could be cleaner and more organized. For examples, the utensil bar had forks, spoons, and knives sticking out of holders. Some fell out of holders. Can eliminate this problem by loading the holders with less items. Loosely packed utensils can be taken out of holders easier and will not pull extra items along. Salad bar needs more frequent tidying. Salad dressing dispensers can be messy. Soup ladle can have shorter handle for easy of serving. Bending it 3 times does not seem to solve the problem.   *The floor can be slippery, be careful when sliding your chairs. The chair may slide further than you expect.  Cannot comment on restroom because I did not use it."}
{"text":"Bad service dirty tables rude need more people with better experience and attitude pizzas done wrong never again will I come to this Cicis horrible horrible manager needs to be there to straighten them out"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying thank you too this amazing staff....all of them were great!!! We went on 12/17/2015 around 5:40pm so if you were there around that shift the credit is for you guys!!! I want to start with the guy who came around picking up our plates he was so polite and he made us feel good he was great. To top it off we had a group of 5 adults and 4 children. It was my brothers (13) BIRTHDAY and he suggested to my mom that they can sing happy birthday for him. We didn't know the surprise the manager gave us!!!! The manager gets his 5 starts he was so nice and humble!!! That makes him a wonderful manager he came to get my brother took him to the back and announced his birthday, next thing you know he had every one in there singing along. At the end he asked my brother what his favorite pizza was and he gave him one to go...Thank you for making our experience a great one!!!!"}
{"text":"Flavorless pizza, full of grease & tasteless crust. Cinnamon rolls just sagged on the plate, they tasted uncooked and lacked appeal. Workers are nice, but food not worth it. Won't be coming back :/"}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with a $6 pizza buffet. It also has a cool arcade. The dessert and salad bar was also pretty nice for the price"}
{"text":"Really Disappointed in this location. Went in for the featured items that were on TV (New York style pizza and the cheesecake brownies). The pizza kept flowing at a reasonable speed, could have been better, but it was crowded so it was acceptable. The cashier was nice. The tables weren't cleaned after ever family got up. The dessert section was the worst of it all. Took forever between batches of fresh cinnamon rolls. However, there wasn't any brownies! Other people were just as shocked as I was. The one thing we were looking forward to they refused to make them! \"We're too busy and since the brownies take a long time to make we're not serving them tonight.\" REALLY??!! There's too much service? You're making too much money to serve the food you're advertising??!! Wow..."}
{"text":"First visit for my son & I to Cici's on February 2, 2011. The staff was very friendly. For the both of us to eat for $12.40 was great. I enjoyed the food, especially the cinnamon rolls & new Bavarian pizza dessert. Would recommend you all going to Cici's."}
{"text":"We're done with this place. It now has a \"to-go\" feel to it.  They no longer have the cheese and red pepper shakers on the table nor the napkin dispenser. Everything is all bunched up around the soda fountain with the lids on one side and the straws on the other!  The paper cups are a really classy touch.  Oh yea, the main reason for the low level of love: they adiosed the memorial to the two officers that lost their lives here in 2014. No respect."}
{"text":"I really like going to Cici's.  In the Vegas area, I've always had pretty good experiences, and this one is no exception.  Friendly and efficient employees cleared tables, rotated pizzas, and took special orders with smiles on their faces.  Lots of parking so nothing to not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is 5 stars \"for a Cici's.\"  Super friendly and helpful staff here.  Now my favorite Las Vegas location, which says a lot because I had two others that I really liked visiting.  Special order pizzas are happily made - no hint whatsoever that you're imposing on anyone.  Not too busy on the Sunday I visited but they took the initiative to exchange out pizzas that were sitting too long.  This is also the first Cici's where I noticed the \"improved\" pizza that their commercials claim."}
{"text":"The friendliest Cici's I've ever been to.  Employees always seem cheerful and are genuinely helpful.  Pricing is the same as other Cici's and the facilities aren't quite as new and fresh-looking as the newer Vegas locations but no other location has employees who cheer me up like this one.    Be sure to make a special order of your favorite pizza when ordering the buffet.  And if you finish, order another.  The staff won't mind.  But unless they fixed it, be careful of the Diet Coke dispenser in their soda fountain.  It takes some playing with to get the soda to come out when you want it to and stop when your cup is full."}
{"text":"A neighbor swears that Cici's has the best pizza and urged me to check it out when I had the chance.  Based on the price, I was expecting the worst.  Just how good can a $5 buffet be?  First, the bad.  Green salad comes out in very small batches and there are a few greasy squeeze bottles.  There are lots of kids running around so you have to be careful not to step on one of them.  The pizzas that are on their usual rotation aren't too interesting.  Now for the amazingly good side.  The pizza was actually pretty good.  Not gourmet-good but at least as good as a Papa John's or Pizza Hut pizza.  And much cheaper.  You can even request your favorite and the staff will bring you several slices when it is ready.  The staff were remarkably cheerful given how busy it was.    Really glad I finally got a chance to try.  I'll probably be back at least once on my next trip when I get tired of the casino buffet food."}
{"text":"Gourmet food this is not! I only come here because I'm a single mom and my son likes this place because of the small arcade.  They had NO pepperoni pizza!! Pepperoni!! The most popular pizza there is!!  They didn't even have one in the oven, I had to special request it!  I decide while I'm waiting for pepperoni to also wait for bread sticks to get out of the oven. The manager comes over to take the empty bread stick tray and proceeds to grab the tongs by the wrong end! He puts out the new tray of bread sticks & puts the same tongs out. I use the spatula from the pizza nearby. He tells me to use the tongs. I say \"No thanks, I just saw you touch the wrong end with your bare hands!\" I'm glad we've had all our shots! Built up immunity here we come!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this CiCi's for years and they have definitely made great strides of improvement lately. A recent change in management has resulted in a brand new salad bar that I found to be surprisingly fresh and well stocked. The old broken game machines are go me and replaced with new ones. Definitely a good place to bring kids or teenagers who eat a lot since the buffet is all-you-can-eat.  For the money this is really a deal. The pizza is what you would expect... marginal at best. But this is about quantity over quality. Just be careful not to come on a night the local football team plays. On those nights the place is jammed with loud middle and high schoolers.  Most of the staff has worked here for years. I have seen the same dedicated employees for as long as I can remember. The sweet lady that cleans the tables speaks only Spanish and some sign language but always smiles and is efficient at keeping tables tidy. Behind the counter, Arisali runs a tight ship and always takes care of special orders. Two thumbs up for her dedication.   I would give 5 stars but there are still some things that need to be fixed in the dining room. Otherwise this place is great if you're looking for lots of food on-the-cheap!"}
{"text":"I have been to other locations before and they were at least 3 star worthy. Im not quite sure why im giving it 2 even, possibly because the salad and the cinnamon rolls were the saving grace. Even then the salad bar was messy with all the different compartments of food, they had bits mixed of one another together. Most of the other products looked like they had been sitting for hours. Saw the employees replacing individual slices from i dont know where but that led me to believe that even the pieces they were adding arent even fresh because they came from a whole pizza else where. I do not remember seeing this done at other locations.   The state of the building is even gross, walls had gunk and soda stains on them and the booths had large gashes in the seat. The store seriously needs to be maintained after being updated."}
{"text":"Cici's pizza buffet might not as excite me as much as Pizza Hut's but for the price it's reasonable. You can ask for custom pizzas which is a plus. I noticed they now serve a pasta salad on top of their buffet options. One odd thing, their stamp card can only get 1 stamp per visit no matter how many buffets you buy at that time. Anyone needing a pizza fix on a budget, very particular or wants to try multiple custom pizzas should give Cici's a try."}
{"text":"Oh CiCi's, how great thou aren't.  A solid three experience overall.  The price of course is a 5, but the food is probably a 3 and the sketchy plaza is a 2.  Service is generally okay; some days are better than others.  On the plus side, they will make you any pizza by special request which is cool since they no longer serve the macaroni and cheese pizza on their bar.  You will see a very diverse group of patrons when you go.  The cheap prices attract all different kinds of folk.  I would be very cautious of visiting this place at night.  They do have a rewards app for frequent purchases and they send you a free buffet coupon on your birthday."}
{"text":"My family used to go a lot! Then they changed managers a few times and each time the service got worse. Finally we started just using take out only, but omg that was even worse! Every time we called in an order our pizza was never done even though we always gave them an extra 10 minutes over the time they told us it would be ready. One night we went and three of our 5 items were ready and the girl just left them on the counter while our breadsticks and dessert cooked for another 10 minutes! Then one terrible night after waiting forever after we got there to pick up, the counter girl dropped one of the pizzas on the floor upside down and seriously asked what we wanted her to do about it!!!!  Yet another time again with the pick up pizza part they were again rude and I said out loud \"I'm so done with this place.\" And the manager said, \"Good!\" What? Wow that was the last straw! My kids used to ask to get it all the time and finally stopped asking thank God! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"This location was clean and I had no real issues with it.  It was lunch time and there were only a few people there and not very busy.  With it not being very busy, I can understand not having a lot of pizza out because it wouldn't be fresh for very long, but they did have some variety and did their best to keep it rotated and fresh. I have no real complaints.  Pizza was fine and of course their cinnamon rolls were awesome."}
{"text":"Let's start by telling you the worst cici's in Las Vegas i've been to almost all of them but this one was the worst one I came in with my wife and son the minute we walked in a young girl looked up at us but didn't say hi didn't say anything just turned her head down and went back to cleaning again we waited for about 3minutes and still there was no to greeted us and no one by the register finally a man came I think he was the manager gave us that look like he was unhappy to see us he was very disrespectful the way he sounded was very rude unprofessional the food was cold/old and nasty the only thing that was fresh was the Philly pizza and that's only because when we got to the line they just put it out the whole place was very dirty the soda machine was very dirty the tables were very dirty and sticky the salad bar was one of the worst salad bar I've ever seen it was complete dirty everywhere everybody working there looked unhappy very rude I understand this is not a five-star restaurant I get it but still it's still a restaurant and we are still paying for service I am very disappointed and by the way if that was the manager his phone was more important then the food the people the guest the soda machines the restrooms, and that face that he had that face that I can't wait to get out of here I hate every customer that walks in type of face, you made me and my family uncomfortable we ate uncomfortable and we we're not satisfied the only reason why we stayed is becuz we just got done from seeing a show and we were very very hungry we wanted something now and we didn't want to wait if management reads this please contact me because I am very very disappointed"}
{"text":"I stopped by after going to the hardware store next door. The food was hot and fresh. The staff was outstanding. I ordered a special pizza and they brought it to my table. Very clean establishment. My daughter kept asking me for money for the games."}
{"text":"You know...I didn't expect much, when I went to this place, partly because the person who invited me has horrible taste in restaurants. However, the pizza was good. It was saucy, plenty of cheese, and the crust was fine. They had a selection of about 7 types of pizza (none of which I particularly like), but I just asked them to prepare one with the toppings that I wanted, and they did so in about 15 minutes (I just took the whole pizza back to our table and ate it). I was happily surprised. They have a soda fountain, so you can get as many re-fills (or different sodas, if you prefer) that you want. This place is good for parties, and there was a small child's birthday party when we were there. The only part of the experience that I didn't like, was when the cleaning person started mopping the floors near us, and we could smell the ammonia, but I just told him to stop, and he complied. All-in-all, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This is my family's number one place to hang out. the food is always good and the staff is always very welcoming. And you can't beat the price for all that you can eat"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with 5 dollar buffet pizza. You get what you pay for ok quality, still tasty."}
{"text":"I mean everyone knows you come for the cinnamon rolls. The pizza is meh but it's only $5 so I mean what is there to complain about. The best thing is that you can order any specialty pizza you want and they will bring you a personal pan size to your table. If you download the phone app you can get rewards --for every 6th visit (I believe) you a get a free buffet. They also will send you coupons for free drinks every now and then.  Giving this three stars because it was pretty dirty (as far as dishes on the tables throughout the restaurant) and they were very slow with putting out new pizzas.   Pro Tip: Follow them on Instagram because every so often they do specials where you can BOGO (free) an adult buffet."}
{"text":"The concept is great.  You get all-you-can-eat pizza, pasta and dessert for $4.99 (adults) and 2.99 (kids) 3 and under eat free.  I went with my wife and kids this past week, it was good.  The guy who greeted us as we walked in was nice, he said \"hi\" and explained the way the place works.  He took our order, and let our kids in free.  The staff was helpful, I asked for a couple pizzas that weren't on the buffet and they were out and ready to eat in 5 min. or so.    The only beef I had was that the pizzas on the buffet when we arrived weren't very fresh.  Some of them could have been combined with others to make room for some new pies.  Beyond that, our kids had a blast, we ate as much as we wanted and we left happy.  We'll be returning soon, I'm sure."}
{"text":"My kids love Cicis pizza. So I take them anytime we find one. I did like the bbq pizza, but that's about it. The place looked clean, and had parking. Not in a great area, but it's good."}
{"text":"A pizza buffet that costs $5 a head. What can you expect from a place like that? As it turns out, nothing much good.  First of all, $5 a person is a little misleading. Drinks go for an addition $2+ each, and if you want wings, add another $5 per person. It can add up.   The pizza just sucks. Actually, there was one with a very thin crust that my wife and I both liked, but it was gone most of the time. There is the problem--nothing good lasts very long and all the worst, coldest, most disgusting pizza hangs around on the buffet forever.  Service sucks too. It took about a year to get our severly overpriced wings. At least they were edible when they did come.   The place is newish, but still manages to look a little dirty and run down--not in a charming, family-doing-the-best-they-can-to-keep-the business-going way either. More like a we-don't-give-a-crap-and-are too-cheap-to-make-restroom-repairs way.  All that said, my 5 year old loved the place, so I will be back kicking and screaming."}
{"text":"Food tasted and looked like it was from the night before! Don't get me started on the salad bar! It all looked rotten and welted. The manager was so rude and kept demanding people to make sure they put the spatula underneath the pan. I've had cici's before and loved it but this was the worst experience! I wish I didn't pay before because it wasn't worth any money!!"}
{"text":"I got there just a hour or so before closing so it wasn't busy at all.   They weren't really putting out much fresh food because the lack of guests in the dining area. The employees were really nice though and came over to my table to ask if I wanted a certain type of pizza to be made. The server recommend a certain type and I agreed.    It's a very small buffet of food and small dining area. By the looks of it, it looks pretty run down.   The food isn't all that good but isn't all that bad. 50-50 to me.   I was the last to leave out and I didn't feel pushed out the door. So that was very nice to not be rushed.   I didn't have a bad experience, but I don't know if I would go back to this one. Maybe try another?"}
{"text":"You're getting ayce pizza for $3.99 you get what you pay for.  Pay, grab a plate, get all the pizzas you can and find a table. SImple. If you don't find any pizza to your liking you can ask them to make one for you!   Again don't expect any sha-bang when you take a bite. The pizza's are very very mediocore. BUT major props to their pepperoni bread that stuff is what makes me a fan of the establishment.  PRO TIP! stay away from the pasta, it looks like it's been there 5ever.  If they place actually tried to scrub and clean the tables and floor then I'd bump this place to four stars. It feels really dirty coming here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to eat at this location on Sept.5 between 4:30-5:15 P.M. What we saw was utterly disgusting. It made us lose our appetites. In addition to the food being horrendous and tasteless we saw at least 6, yes, SIX health code violations. Among them were the cover to the ice dispenser (where the ice is dumped in) uncovered allowing dirt/insects to potentially enter, the cover, itself, was lying on the floor and employees were placing dirty dishes on it, the trash cans used to bring the ice to the dispenser was very filthy and was not marked, as is the health regulation, \"FOR ICE ONLY\". In addition all of the employees that I saw used only water to wash their hands. NO SOAP WAS EVER USED. When I spoke to one of the \"managers\", a young Asian woman, she just shrugged and didn't seem to care about my complaints. When we were leaving the CiCi's one of the employees followed us outside and verbally harassed as well as started yelling at us. This was reprehensible. I will never eat at a CiCi's again. The company's regard for sanitary conditions leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure if this CiCi's violates health regulations they all do.  Bottom line: DO NOT EAT AT CICI'S IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH!!  Who knows what else goes on behind closed doors when no one  else is around."}
{"text":"THEY DEMAND PHOTO ID WITH EVERY CREDIT CARD PURCHASE. This is not only extremely poor customer service, inconvenient,and improper but ignorant. To argue and refuse service to paying customers,and create a scene for$16.00 is absurd. Before you  attempt to rebuke this post - understand that your opinion in favor of this ignorant policy does not matter.   When Cici's agreed to take Visa/MasterCard, they agreed to abide by the Card Association Rules -and cannot routinely demand ID if a customer presents a valid signed credit card. I believe that this is a violation of privacy and demanding ID still does not  protect them from fraudulent transactions, chargebacks,or credit card fraud. Citing an ignorant company policy advising them to break rules or laws, does not make the action permissible. To overlook this transgression against customers is to overlook the employee abuse,sexual harassment, immigrant abuse that is likely occurring in this  chain as well.  To add insult, they were loud and argumentative while I was in line with a large group for my daughters soccer team pizza party. I had to leave and go to an ATM to get cash.   I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT INTO ANY ONE OF THESE STORES AGAIN. I WILL VEHEMENTLY GO OUT OF MY WAY TO LET EVERYONE KNOW NOT TO PATRONIZE THIS STORE, AND THIS CHAIN.  I am also asking everyone that has been ignorantly carded to file a complaint with Visa https://usa.visa.com/checkoutfees/contact.jsp -check the last box and put in the comments that the  store displayed Visa signage,but refused to accept your card without ID.  Report MasterCard Violations by  Merchants: http://www.mastercard.us/support/merchant-violations.html  Choose the third box down to report that the merchant violated Card Association Rules for requiring identification.   Store Manager was extremely rude - Scott Georgeff.  District Manager for this store is Shannon Young 702-334-3174  Please do not support this location.Poor customer service is not to be tolerated. Quality food chains would never embarrass and mistreat their customers. I worked at InnOut Burger, and we were instructed even to  give a patron a free meal if they  ever came in and had forgotten their wallet at home or didn't have enough money. We could never badger them or argue, or embarrass them.  http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/can-retailers-ask-id-with-credit_card-1282.php  https://www.privacyrights.org/ar/Alert-FS15.htm  http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2011/02/can-a-merchant-require-id-for-a-credit-or-debit-card-purchase/index.htm"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good..preferring the thin crust. The salad bar is not bad. Though this location was full. I'd say the atmosphere is the biggest highlight. Warm, and appealing. Though its a serve yourself type deal, so I can't say anything about the service. Their pizza is not my favorite, but I was invited by some friends. All in all, their food is nothing to rave about, but it was still a pleasant experience..."}
{"text":"The most disgusting location!! This is the first time I've tried CiCi pizza and will be the last ... when you walk in every last table was filled with plates and trash and the staff had not gotten to so I had to clean my own table .. no worries they were busy .I had to have the cashier give me a new cup 4 times because they were filthy..in which they had the cashier making salad for the salad bar at the register with no gloves ! I still wasn't pleased but my husband was starving and $5.99 for all you can eat Buffett is good which clearly now means don't always go the cheap stuff!! .. as I go to the salad bar there is food all over the place that looks like it had not been cleaned in weeks. I WATCHED the manager empty out trash that's by the soda fountain and went directly to the pizzas to arrange them .. there was no hand washing ! I called him out on it and he stated that he used HAND SANTIZER! What happened to old fashion soap and water ?? My husband ate the spinach pizza and spat it up and asked was it seaweed! The manager was no sympathetic and frankly did not care .. he told me that none of his staff was required to wear gloves as long as bare hands didn't directly touch food .. so it's okay that the cashier made salad next to the cash register because the salad came in the bag and she wasn't physically touching it !! Wtf .. so we advised that we were leaving and as we left my husband decided to take pics of how nasty and filthy the place was ... and that's when the manager became upset threatened to take his phone and called the police on us! Never again will I go here or recommend it to anyone !!"}
{"text":"My children (8 & 10) LOVE this place. Every time they get any choice/input on where to go for dinner IHOP and Cici's are mentioned.  My son (8) thinks the \"You just order a pizza with whatever you want and they bring it to you for FREE!!\" I tried explaining that I paid for him to get in...  Anyways Cici's gets 5 stars from my kids and 3 from me."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this local CiCi's quite often when I was on a budget and lived here before.  For price you can't beat it.  For $8.99, you can have all you pizza, salad, and pasta you can eat.  Including a drink and free refills.  I mean you honestly cannot find a much better deal anywhere.  The salad is average.  Cold and crisp but sometimes no romance and just iceberg which is annoying.  The pizza to be quite honest is above average.  And they can concoct any kind of pizza you like and bring it to the table for you.  Any type of veggie pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, macaroni and cheese pizza, taco salad pizza are a few of their originals.  All of them are pretty good.  I'm a fan of the macaroni and cheese pizza!  Who doesn't like mac n cheese and pizza, especially when you combine them!  To top it off they usually have brownies, and some type of cinnamon role for dessert!  Both are hands down amazing!!!  The worst part of this place is the kids yelling and screaming, running around.  There is a small game room there and it usually houses youth baseball parties and children birthday parties.  So if you can get around rude annoying kids lol this is the place!!!!"}
{"text":"First time being at cicis today! It was delicious and not only did they have a lot of options they switched out pizzas regularly which kept the pizzas fresh. My husband and my favorite part was Wiley (I may be spelling his name wrong) he has such a warm spirit and was interacting with all customers while cleaning. You can tell he genuinely cares about others and loves his job!"}
{"text":"I love Cici's.  Being a native Texan, I always went to this place as a kid.  Being that they closed the one here in Tucson, whenever I am in the Phoenix area I make sure to stop by.  The food is great and you have a great selection of things to try all for a cheap price.  The people complaining about the quality are crazy.  What did you expect for a buffet that costs $5.99??  This place hits the spot and it super cheap if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"I like Cici's Pizza. The crust is better than it used to be and the desserts are awesome! I especially love the cinnamon rolls and brownies. I just wish the dining area was cleaner... there is always food all over the floor and little kids crawling around on it. So gross. I also wish they had the mac & cheese pizza out on the buffet. You can request a personal pizza, but I could only eat a couple slices of it and the rest would go to waste. I think a location in Avondale would do really well..."}
{"text":"Incredible food, and the staff here is AMAZING: happy, upbeat, and friendly. I'll definitely be making this my regular Cicis for the staff alone."}
{"text":"Great pizza and it's all you can eat, They even make your favorite and bring it over to your table. The salad bar is awesome as well. The owners and staff are always there to help."}
{"text":"Took the kids to Cici's recently and we enjoyed the $5.00 pizza buffet.  They had some tasty pizzas and some not-so-tasty pizzas.  The stuffed crust pizzas were really good.  My favorite was the stuffed pretzel crust pizza.  It tasted good, was fresh, and had a yummy filling.  You can't beat the price.  Plus, my kids are picky, but Cici's has a pizza for every pallet. Free refills on drinks is always a good thing.  We'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"Love the lunch buffet special. Great variety,  clean and they keep it refilled.  With laundromat two doors down its a perfectly weekly treat!"}
{"text":"Best Cici's I've ever ben to. There are many in the Las Vegas area, so I depended on Yelp! to point me to the one with the highest rating, even though it was another 5 miles more than the nearest location.   First off, a fantastic \"Welcome to Cici's\" from almost the entire staff, and it was during a Friday evening rush. The busser especially was so full of energy. He reminded me of Jimmie Walker from Good Times without the \"Dy-no-mite!\"  After a long day of work, it was an immediate attitude adjustment from there forward.  Arriving during the dinner rush at Cici's is always a good idea because the food is a-flowing. So many pizzas, pastas, deserts, and salad bar all freshly made and hot.   The night manager Espy was very concerned right off that we were happy and he asked if we'd like a personal pan pizza custom made for us. Yes, of course. They now brush the crust with Garlic Butter and both my combo pizza and my wife's pepperoni and mushroom were dee-licious.  I normally like to focus on the pizza, but I watched the girl at the front take such good care of the salad bar, cleaning and restocking it constantly, that I went for a salad and it was crisp and fresh. My wife had the pasta and she said it was good as well. We both liked the garlic bread as well and returned for more.  There were 3 dessert items, a cinnamon roll, an apple strudel pizza, and their chocolate brownies. I had seconds of each.  Suffice to say, we rolled out of there very full but very satisfied. And the staff all yelled thank you to us as we left.   Cici's pizza is not gourmet pizza, it is pizza rolled out on a large scale to feed a lot of people. We knew this going in. Each individual restaurant offers its own experience. This particular one just happens to be the best we've been to. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a CiCis Pizza, it is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I started going to others when I was a little kid, however, more recently their entire business model has changed to \"5 dollars and change\" - the total cost was $5.99. I also purchased a drink, but if you download the app and register, you get a free drink!   They have one long buffet with several areas - first the salad bar, which had several different types of veggies and dressings. I did not find any cheese the first time I went, but then I saw that they were in individual containers. There was also a very delicious pasta salad which tasted like Italian dressing. The second \"section\" was the soup and pasta section which included pasta with the choice of either marinara or a white sauce. I had the marinara and it tasted great.   The third section had several types of pizza - I had the pepperoni, the New York Style Pepperoni/Sausage, buffalo chicken, and then the deep dish (which I did not like much). I had to say, my favorite was the New York Style, but the others were equally as good. The sauce is a sweeter sauce, which personally I like for my pizza, and I love buffalo chicken pizza, but this one was really dry.   One thing that I saw is if you do not like something that is on their bar, you are able to order your own pizza. I personally did not, however, it is an option, and there is a piece of paper for you to go and order from, and then they give you a beeper once it is done.   The last section is by far my favorite, and that is their dessert. They are known for their cinnamon rolls which are melt in your mouth delicious.  They also had an apple pie dessert pizza, and from my understanding, it was delicious.   Also - the drinks are self serve; it is right by the end of the buffet.   There is also an option to purchase chicken wings (they are not included) - but, it's an all you can eat buffet, so unless you NEED chicken wings, it's kind of a waste. If you do not want to eat there, you can always pick up pizza to go, and the prices seemed like what you would pay at a Dominos pizza.   Another nice feature of the restaurant is that there is an arcade there with traditional arcade games. Good touch for the kids!  Finally - to the reason they got 3 stars, and not 5. The restaurant is gross. The floors were so sticky and the staff does not know how to clean up very well - the entire time I was there, there was a slice of pizza on the floor. Nobody in my party wanted to use the bathroom there because of how gross the place was. The staff was not that attentive either, which you need to be because it is a buffet.   Another little thing - there were no plates by the salad, even though the salad was first on the buffet line...   The food was great - for $6, it is a great deal, however, the place is very dirty and sticky. I know I will be sending a message to corporate so then they know because that is how bad it was. If you bring your kids, make sure you bring wipes to wipe everything down."}
{"text":"CiCi's has great food, especially the desserts, and pretty affordable too! The manager was super nice too. Only issues was, the arcade area took some of our money, without letting us play. And the sticker machine was out of stickers, but still took our quarters, so again, we got nothing. It would be really nice if they could make sure those things were properly labeled when they run out, check on them more often maybe."}
{"text":"Seriously, living in LA County and San Francisco for years, I've spent way too much time as a mindless drone watching television shows and commercials. Besides the usual Ruby Tuesday and Sonic's Drive-In commercials airing and finally popping up at more convenient locations. I couldn't find a Cici's near the Bay so I felt doomed to forever see images of an endless pizza buffet with no cure in sight. However, that changed when a few friends decided to make a trek out to Las Vegas for a birthday weekend and we would make a stop at Cici's...SCORE!!!  Upon walking in, there is a roar, \"Hello! Welcome to Cici's!\" from the employees that caught me off guard. Paying at the register, we grabbed our plates and started with salad? Yes, we started off with some overdressed salad with bacon...oh the bacon, how unhealthy it was to even look at the salad. The workers do their best to put out consistent pizza for those who don't want any specifics to grab, and most pizza are made to order and can even be brought out to your table if you have enough hungry people.   We've tried the Mac n' Cheese Pizza, Cheese Burger Pizza, Spicy Buffalo Chicken, and the Chicken Alfredo just to name a few. Most were good quality, and I was mystified that the cheeseburger pizza tasted like a cheeseburger. Moreover, an employee said that it would taste better with bacon and went ahead to fry some bacon and topped the rest of our pizza at our request.   I wasn't expecting any amazing, but to fulfill my desire to gorge in some pizza at a cheap price. Employees were happy, and were more than accommodating to our needs. I would recommend Cici's if they had the opportunity to swing by Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well ill start this off on the good points. Its 7 dollars and with the tax and the drink for the buffet. The pizzas are pretty tasty. Love the Cinna bread stuff, the brownies and the apple dessert pizza though it can be a little to sweet. Depends on who makes it.   NOW FOR THE BAD.  I walk in, and am waiting for a Cashier and it takes 10 minutes before someone comes up to ring me up. The pizza station wasnt stocked at all, and the pizzas that were up there had minimal pizzas left. The bread sticks werent on par with the ones ive had at other Cicis in other states. The Sweet Tea wasnt sweet at all.   They have a hard time keeping the pizzas fresh and stocked. Same thing with the Desserts they werent stocked well at all. They come around often and clear your table. They also forget about your special order pizza and instead of taking responsibility they try to pass the blame on someone int he kitchen.  I have never seen such a worse group of people in there. And ive ate at Cici's in Colorado and Arizona. People coming in wearing Pajama pants and slippers with there underwear plainly visible. Men wearing Shorts with there boxers showing and wearing a wife beater and you can see the disgusting stomach hanging out. Parents letting there kids play with the soda machine, and Kids being inside and are wearing dirty clothes.   The restaurant area is clean. But this one straddles the area of Nice and Ghetto on Nellis And Stewart. And I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS ONE. Looking at some of the patrons almost grossed me out so bad i almost lost my dinner. This should be named Pistol Petes and not Cicis Pizza."}
{"text":"I can't believe the rude managers here! We were talked to badly and told we weren't going to be served!"}
{"text":"Usually this place is the bomb....but this time...on 4th of July no less....it was a let down!  Fist the AC wasn't working...then the soda machine didnt have ice....then the coke was flat....ay....they still charged me for a drink....when I forced myself to drink stale fruit punch....It's Vegas though sometimes you get a break and sometimes you have to give a break...."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Cheap lunch with a tons of pizza, pasta, soup and dessert options, how could it get any better?  This place is on top of things, every thing!!!  I witnessed the employees changing out the pizza at the right time every time.  Even if a pizza hadn't been out too long, they followed the rules to the T.  The soda fountain machine was calibrated correctly, and believe it or not, this is actually very difficult to find.  The coke was the best tasting coke, like, ever!!!  And they also have apple fanta, which is very rare to find.  Bathrooms were clean with plenty of toilet paper.  Plates were picked up quickly from the tables.  The pizza was great!!!  Oh and the pasta was tasty, the sauce was very delicious and it made me think it was homemade.  Oh and the brownies were so yummy.  The cinnamon rolls....lets just say I was in heaven.  Overall, I will say that I was very impressed with this establishment."}
{"text":"Fancy, we don't do fancy at Cici's Pizza. This is a simple, quick, buffet style eatery. $5.49 is the everyday price, and $4.99 is the lunch special price on Monday-Friday from 11am-2pm. If I read correctly, drinks are an additional $.50 as well.   Mac'N'Cheese pizza was surprisingly good. Usually don't like my carbs on carbs action, but a small slice should do. I didn't go in expecting anything more than what I got and left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"I went couple of times for buffet.....I take sriracha sauce along with me everytime and they allow me with that  :) Pizza taste good but cheese sticks are better :) Staff is super friendly and they will do one for you in customized way like you wish and it will be served to your desk.... I went with my friends and they liked it as well. If you are vegetarian then they will prepare something vegie option for you... they dont have jalepeno topping but they have other good toppping like black olives, onion, bell pepper, green pepper etc..... A good place for family buffet at affordable price 5$  :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza and inexpensive!! Don't see what you want? Order personal pizza for no additional cost."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple Cici's in other states, this one was a little disappointing. But, for the price ($5.50 per person + $1.50 for drink) you are getting endless pizza and there awesome cinnamon roll things.   The pizza here is quantity, not quality, although they do have interesting topping combos (like mac&cheese or buffalo chicken) and they rotate pretty often. Don't expect much from the \"salad bar\", its basically two pre-made salads soaked in dressing.  Overall, its OK. I'll probably be back only because I can't get enough of there Cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"fine for a buffet. it is a whopping five bucks- what did you expect?  and really, what do to expect?  it's a stinking pizza buffet!  expect to see a lot of veggie, pepperoni, meaty, cheese only pies.  and they're just fine.  are they the best pizzas ever?  no.  BUT IT IS FIVE BUCKS.  what do you want?!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for Cicis and my visit 9/5/15 was TERRIBLE.  THE PLACE WAS FILTHY! I didnt want to touch anything!!!!!!!!!!! I made one trip to the buffet after washing my hands, and I used hand sanitizer that I set on the table for my husband and son to use as well. When I say dirty I mean everything was covered in soda, dirt and mud on the floor to boot!  When you run a high traffic establishment I would think you change tongs and spatulas frequently- like every 30 mins. I would be shocked if they changed them once a day. The flat bread pizza was the only thing that was fully cooked. The pizza's were soggy, brownies were underdone, and the soda had a funny taste to it.  Avoid this place, even if you have a groupon- get a refund."}
{"text":"Well, it's a Cici's and if you've never been to a Cici's don't go in there with high expectations. You certainly wouldn't go into McDonald's expecting a culinary masterpiece so expect the same here.  One of the reviewers before me said that during dinner time you will bump into a bunch of \"loud, poorly behaved children and their unconscious parents\" and yes, this is correct but because THIS is their demographic.  Again, you should know where you're going. You wouldn't go into Chuck E. Cheese expecting a nice quiet, romantic dinner, now would you? Same concept here, it is targeted to families with kids who can quickly satisfy the kids and give parents a break. If you're don't fall into this demographic then either go during off-peak hours or stay at home with your high-end, water bottle drinking dog and your unhealthy relationship with the animal (I have kids and wouldn't walk into a Doggie Cafe and bitch about all the smelly dogs and their inconsiderate owners who bring them there).  Which leads to the quality of the food. Again, Cici's target demographic are families with kids (which explains a lot of the set up). Parents who don't feel like cooking supper that night, or little league teams to go celebrate their 20 game losing streak or, god forbid, A BIRTHDAY PARTY! So, the pizza is not catering to the sophisticated palate of the NoDa or Dilworth crowds. They cater to the underdeveloped palate of kids who would enjoy a Mac n' Cheese pizza and the parents who are too tired to give a crap either way. The food is passable at best if you understand the restaurant's concept.  Which brings us to the restaurant as a whole. When we went last night they were at max capacity so the whole place was a cacophony of sounds, screams, clanking, announcements, games, etc. Despite it all, the crew did an excellent job at keeping the pizza coming and the buffet line well stocked.  Unfortunately this left a great deal of the restaurant being dirty and messy. But then again, you can hardly blame that on the crew since it was the hoard of \"loud, poorly behaved children and their unconscious parents\" who were making the mess.  The biggest gripe about this, and just about every other Cici's out there, is their painfully crappy game room. Most of the games do not work properly and cost $0.50 a piece. Most of the games aren't even video games but rather those machines where you can earn insanely cool prizes like Xboxes and Mp3 players but the game rules and/or difficulty are so ridiculous nobody ever wins. Poor kids are stuck with two skeeball machines, a basketball machine, a racing game (which didn't steer properly) and an air hockey machine... the rest are the \"prize\" games.  Ultimately, me and the family got exactly what we were there for... cheap pizza, agood time for the kids and avoiding having to cook for 8 people."}
{"text":"This was the kids' choice after a hike at Red Rock. It was an economical way to feed some hungry mouths that aren't particular about their pizza. I was in the minority as I ate my pizza and gazed out the window at Sushi Mon across the parking lot.  Everyone was full when we left and we fed 5 people for under $26. I would say the pizza is middle of the road. It was just fine for the kids. Others that had the salad bar and pasta did not complain.  The staff is friendly and always greet you when coming and going. They do a good job of replacing finished pizzas at the buffet and clearing empty plates from the tables. I'd take the family here again if it was their choice and if we weren't looking to break the bank."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Cici's pizza, they have a pretty decent buffet for $5.99 with lots of options. Cici's is a great alternative to making dinner! The buffet is frequently being replenished with hot fresh food.  It's family friendly and pretty spacious inside.   There was a problem with an extra charge on my receipt and the manager was hands on, there was a error in the way my 12 sliced stuffed crust pie was cut and without skipping a beat the manager took care of it to my satisfaction! A satisfied customer was his primary concern."}
{"text":"No. No. No. The reason I give 1 star is you can get full for cheap, and there is a salad bar. The rest of the food offered is just mixing the same few ingredients together in different ways."}
{"text":"YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG.  $5.50 per person for unlimited pizza, pasta, salad and dessert. Extra $1 for a fountain drink. If you opt out, snag a water cup and fill it with Sprite. They didn't say anything to us. I mean, it's Cici's. It's ghetto like that.  Some necessary items to try: The Bacon Salad (only because I don't know what exactly the \"bacon\" is-- bits of plastic?), The Buffalo Chicken Pizza (I only verified this from the website-- we all thought it was nacho pizza), The Alfredo Pizza (no Marinara, sub Alfredo-- weird), and last but not least THE MACARONI AND CHEESE PIZZA. No marinara, sub maca-cheese sauce, with noodles all over the top. Nasty in the best way possible.  I probably ate my weight in pizza. I'm not kidding here-- at least 8 slices, plus some salad, some pasta, a gank of garlic bread, topping it off with four or five cinnamon rolls and a slice of apple-cinnamon pizza. Delicious.   This is good and satisfying the way that hangover food is satisfying. It's like Souplantation-- but not good for you. It's like all you can eat Shakey's. Cici's doesn't attract the nicest clientele, and there's lots of kids running all over the place, but facing these horrors is worth it for the experience. I drove all the way to Vegas and 15 miles farther up the I-15 than I needed to just to experience this place.  There's commercials for this joint all over California, but I believe I can confidently say that me and my boyfriend were some of the first Californians to go out of our way to experience the nastiness that is Cici's Pizza.  For some reason, this listing doesn't come up in Google and I was only able to find it by searching by zip code on the Cici's website. Next time you're in Vegas, hit it up!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, ready to take request for any kid of pizza. Restroom could use a little bit more of cleaning."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Las Vegas from Sacramento California. In Sacramento the TV commercials for CiCis plays all the time, but there is not an open location anywhere. We always said if one opened we would go check it out because it looks so good. Well you know how commercials make things look great, When we pulled into town I realized that we live a few blocks from this location. The first chance we got we had to check out CiCi's. Unlike the commercial the pizza was so so and there was no lady screaming Cutter at the top of her lungs. There are a few good things, you can request any kind of pizza you want and how many pieces or a whole pie to be brought to your table and they give you a cone to put on the table and when it is done they bring your hot pizza. And.......well.... It's just flat out cheap."}
{"text":"Pizza is normally cold and hard- tables not clean, restaurant dirty.  Crowded, dirty restrooms... i could go on all day.  The pizza is bad, to say it nicely.  Only good thing here is the price."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food is pretty decent, the adult buffet is $6 a person so it's definitely a great price. Clean. They were having issues with the register so they graciously let us eat for free, which was awesome. Love the cinnamon buns."}
{"text":"Just horrible! It's 5:36 pm and not a single pizza is out! There's now a shit ton of people in here and as soon as they put a pizza out, one of the family's come and take most of it. The worst $8 if spent in a long while"}
{"text":"The pizza was good when we custom ordered it. The service was lacking and tables were dirty. I also found a hair in the cinnamon bread. I thought it was just a little burnt piece on the side of it so I pulled at it. Seeing the hair come out of it was gross and ruined my experience as that must have been cooked inside of it."}
{"text":"The good: The price. $4.99 for all you can eat  The Bad: Everythig else. The food pretty much sucks. Its edible but the ingredients are cheap. The majority of the customers are SUPER trashy and there are kids running around everywhere. I guess thats what to expect at a cheap all you can eat buffet!  Overall: Avoid this place at all costs unless you are on welfare, are a bum, are missing more teeth than you have, or have no tastebuds"}
{"text":"Ok, first let me start by stating that this place isn't expensive so do not expect gourmet pizza or you will be dissappointed. This was the last place we ate at on our family's stay in Vegas. The fact that I paid less than $30 for a family of four speaks well of this establishment. It wasnt the best pizza as Chicago pizza is best hands down. It is buffet all you can eat and they will make a pizza for you on request. The Buffalo chicken pizza was a bit on the spicy side. I did not like the BBQ pizza. Somehow I don't have a taste for that. All the other pizzas I had were very good. Especially the thick crust.      When you first walk in you will be greeted and thanked out loud. This happens to all who enter as well as thanking you when you leave. Workers are always, I mean ALWAYS, going by making sure everything is OK with you or your group. And this is for every customer.  The workers, including the manager at smiling so big, you almost wonder.....am I on earth. They also have soups, salads, pastas and desserts on the budget table. For extra charge the do have wings to complete your meal.      I would never have expected the atmosphere of this place and for this pleasant surprise I give it a 5 star for its value and friendliness.  It will not be the best pizza you ever had but it will be one of the most memorable the first time you eat there."}
{"text":"Oh boy . I know that Cici's is not top notch dining by any means and I know you get what you pay for is a thing but man .... I'd rather go to Caesar's ! The pizza here is like cardboard and not good. The most decent things here is the pasta and the salad bar, that's it. The restaurant itself needs to be kept up with more as there were a few dirty tables when we came in. The staff however is very nice. Don't think I'll be coming back here again unless I feel like being cheap asf for an ok salad and some whatever pasta."}
{"text":"Great service and they kept fresh pizza coming! Good place to take the kids for pizza"}
{"text":"I was here with the family for my daughter's birthday. It was the worst experience I've ever had CiCi restaurant. I will b even go back to this address. Food was cold and was like eating cardboard. I was so very disappointed after paying almost $40 for four people it what a waste of money!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place, and always has.  Every time we walk in we get greeted, they talk to her like a person (she's 9), but ignore her because she not's paying.  She enjoys getting her own food, and because I can see her from any table, she enjoys going up alone.  All the servers are polite and make a point to talk to her, and the pizza is always hot.  This is a regular lunch/dinner spot when I am out with my kids running errands or to just get them out of the house to give my wife 2 hours of alone time.  Finally, can't beat the price."}
{"text":"My family of 5 came to Cici's Pizza Restaurant for the first time. We felt welcomed by the friendly and professional lady smiling and happy to explain the process to us.  Her name was Sabrina Mucha. After listening to the process and what was included, we were quite impressed with such an affordable price per person for the Buffet Line.       That being said, we tried each item, from salads, soups, pastas, and finally pizza varieties.  As we were enjoying the food, we noticed a gentleman, (he seemed like a manager), who was taking charge by making sure the food stayed fresh,  the buffet area maintained a clean area, and that the food kept coming so their was always full and fresh items  to keep customers full and happy.   Additionally, we were pleasantly surprised with the Daily Special and a new item, the Macaroni & Cheese Pizza.  It was delicious.  As we ate, our 20 month old son got to play in the small game room.  There was only one entrance into the game room, so we felt that it was a safer environment for him!        As we enjoyed our meal, we noticed how the manager in training (as I discovered later), named Mr. Manuel Lopez....continued to maintain food supplies, jumped in cleaning and making sure customers were content.  My entire family was truly impressed.  For the affordable meal, we truly got the value for our money, and more.....a great experience.  We will definitely be back and bringing more people with us  Sincerely, Mrs. Pamela Ransom and Family."}
{"text":"Great service and great food ! The one near us closed and we've been missing it, so glad to come and have a great experience ."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start this review with a few basic questions....  Do you enjoy eating dinner and then waking up in the morning with excruciating stomach pain?   Do you fancy yourself a few rounds of explosive diarrhea?   Do you find sick pleasure in spending 30 dollars on food that looked (and tasted) like it was dragged across the floor of a filthy New York City subway bathroom?  Do you desire wasting time while a child at the cash register tries to figure out the immensely complex activity of adding numbers together with a machine designed to handle such a task?  Perhaps you are interested in salad dressing that is watery and conjures up memories of that time your friends dared you to consume a strange substance that had been sitting out in the sun for days (while you secretly thought it was a bodily secretion of some sort)?  If you answered yes to any of the questions, then oh boy you are in luck. Cici's in Mesa will unabashedly deliver such an experience to you. Just make sure your immunizations are up-to-date.   We have been to CiCi's in other locations many times, and while the food is not stellar most of the time (you get what you pay for), at least it has been edible. This location is an abomination and should be eradicated for the good of all man kind.  I give this place a one star basically because the soda seemed fine."}
{"text":"We haven't been there in a while, so  we went last night. All young kids working there.  The place was dirty, garbage all over the floor, the place where YOU have to put your dirty plates was disgusting.  There was no salt in the restaurant.  They kept running out of pizza and not replacing it in a timely manner.  They put the old pizza under the counter when bringing out a fresh one.  I watched a worker take one piece of pizza from under the counter and pit it on a fresh pizza pan.  Who knows how long it was under there.  One man ordered a special pizza, and 45 minutes later the small pizza came to him.  He had to take it to go as it took too long. I took pictures of the dirt and empty shelves.  As we entered, there was no One at the register.   We had to wait a  few minutes until the cashier helped us.  The ranch dressing had a sticker on the bottom that said Friday. We were there Sunday night. People were asking for spoons, salt, and pizzas.  The employees seemed like they didn't want to be bothered. One poor lady finally got a spoon after asking 3 different workers.  We will never go back to Cici on N. Rainbow."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a pizza as good as the macaroni and cheese pizza.   It is SO good I almost cried that I didn't go to cici's pizza any time in my 19 years of living.  I definitely recommend going to Cici's pizza- even if people say it's not good."}
{"text":"I paid around $9 for all you can eat pizza and a drink.  I think I would rather just order Barro's for a few dollars more.  The pizza is okay I guess.  It's very average in my opinion.  The crowd here is... well, \"interesting.\"  Picture \"People of Wal-Mart.\"  Overall this place has average pizza, but I guess if you can eat a LOT the all you can eat might be a good deal for you."}
{"text":"You get what you paid for. They really need to make the place a little more presentable. My family and I have always wanted to try a Cicis and this was not what we expected. Pizza was ok when it was fresh. Some of them had been sitting for awhile and were nasty. They need to clean better also. Tables were wobbly. Hopefully we will find a Cicis that's not as bad one day."}
{"text":"I always love CiCis, nothing big about this location but the staff is friendly. I love how you can request special orders of pizzas free of charge!"}
{"text":"To the man who cleans the tables, Thank you! You were amazing with my son who has a learning disability as well as problems with social interactions. You got on his level, we're kind, and simply took the time. He enjoyed being treated like a normal child. Thank you for getting the stuck ball out of the machine for him as well. That could have led to a melt down, but didn't because you cared. You took the time and helped. I can not say thank you enough for tonight."}
{"text":"Wiley is the best!! He made my whole family smile & he made us feel so welcome. Thank you for being the greatest employee Wiley we appreciate all your hard work and advice on the food. Your customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here after doing a bit of shopping.  Being a New Yorker, I decided to see how other places did their pizza, so...in comes CiCi's.  Service:  Friendly enough.  But the staff stand around for the most part.  Atmosphere:  Typical buffet restaurant.  Quite popular with locals.  Food:  Meh- but incredibly cheap!  While the buffet itself (filled with an unlimited pizza and salad bar) is $5.99, you can get an individual slice for 81 cents.   Yes, 81 cents.   The slices are really small and not that remarkable, but you get what you pay for.  I bought the pepperoni stuffed crust and the garlic veggie slices.  The former was really doughy, had a sauce that was reminiscent of ketchup and was doused with too much butter, but did the trick.  I liked the garlic veggie slice, but unfortunately the crust was so thin it reminded me of water crackers.    CiCi's pizza would have normally received two stars for the quality and taste of food- it isn't bad, but I've had WAY better pizza.  However, they get an extra star due to its incredible value and generosity of food offerings."}
{"text":"My goodness I love this place. It's not top quality pizza (otherwise I'd surely rate this place 5stars). Well this place gets my attention every time I'm in Vegas. Only wish they had this place in the Bay Area. The concept of this place is quite simple, pay a small price to get in, and eat ALLLLLL the pizza you want. Yup that's right! Pizzzzzza buffet!. Not only do the serve pizza here, they have a salad bar, soup, and even pasta! I'm not sure what it was that we paid to get in this place, but I simply can't get enough of it. I'd pay up to $10 an adult to eat at this joint. I know it's a bit pricey, but I love this place and I'm a sucker for pizza.  When you get here you see your normal, cheese pizza, peperoni, yada yada. But what I mainly come here is their unique pizza toppings. Here's a few that I like to eat.  Macaroni Pizza BBQ Chicken Pizza Buffalo Chicken Pizza Spinach Pizza Taco Pizza -----this is my all time favorite  There are a few that I haven't mentioned, you just have to go to this place and check it out for yourself. If you don't see a certain pizza you want to try, you can always ask the cooks to make a few slices for you and they'll be more than welcome to help you out.  There are also some desserts also, that I haven't mentioned only because sweets aren't my cup of tea and I'm not sure how they taste. Although the wifey says their great, I trust here because she sure knows her sweets. Pasta, soup and salad are good too, not top notch but good enough to get you satisfied.  Like I said before, this place isn't top quality pizza you would normally get compared to a NY Pizza Joint etc, which is the only reason from keep me rating this to 5 stars. But all in all, I enjoy coming here every time I'm in town and I'm sure I won't get tired of it. I recommend all pizza lovers to try this place out, if you love pizza, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Is it poisonous? No. But it's basically the absolute worst pizza I've ever had. I had a BOGO buffet coupon for UNLV students that I used today for lunch with my friend Jen S.   Salad bar - has two ice berg salads with bleh dressing. Soup - one soup option. Worse than Campbell's minestrone. Multiple types of pizza with a lousy crust. I scraped the teaspoon of toppings off of about 5 slices of pizza and left the sub par  crust. Spiral pasta with either meh alfredo or meh marinara sauce. Dessert pizza was so bad that I spit it out in my napkin.  The only good thing was the cinnamon spirals and the buffalo chicken pizza was edible. That's it.  Staff was extremely peppy and I'm not sure how they were able to be. Some extremely overweight customer kept hassling them for extra toppings for his buffet pizza and salad and was cross because they didn't have chicken wings on the buffet... annoying.  It cost slightly under $10 for 2 buffets and 2 drinks with the coupon. Waste of money."}
{"text":"The food was soso. I have had better at Cici. I want to use my Amex and Discover cards to get the most points/cash back as possible and this place only accepts Visa and Master Card. I asked the owner and he said it was too expensive to accept them. Funny, because the cashier said many people come in trying to use their Amex cards. I called the location on Tropicana and Eastern and they were very nice and said they accept all cards. I won't be back to this location. The only thing good about this location is Wiley."}
{"text":"Do yourself and your body a favor....DO NOT GO HERE!!!! Still in pain 24 hours after mistakenly giving into the kids and taking them here. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this Cici's branch a 5 star rating is because of their magnificent bus boy Wiley. He was so energetic, enthusiastic, respectful, as well as kind hearted. I have never seen a bus boy work so hard as well as be extremely kind towards customers. When you eat at a place such as CiCi's you expect the service to be horrid. However, this man gives it his all and provides the best customer service he possibly can. This world would surely be a better place if everyone had as much enthusiasm and happiness as he does."}
{"text":"$5.49 pizza buffet??? Yes, please!  $1.89 for a fountain drink.  Went 5-2-15 for dinner.  Place is kinda dirty and in a sketchy location and there were lots of kids running around screaming. However, I like the pizza and  I like Cici's because you can request any pizza you want and they'll make it for you."}
{"text":"We know what we're getting when we go to CiCi's Pizza but this was horrible. This was the dirtiest restaurant we have ever been to. The pizzas were scarce, they don't use trays here, there was food all over the floor and there was vomit on the floor in the men's room. We cut it short and left. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Food was OK, but most of the pizza was dry. Most tables were dirty, and there were wild and noisy teenagers in the game room, abusing the equipment, and the staff did nothing about it."}
{"text":"Its good for  the price 5.99 for unlimited pizza it's not bad. Food looks fresh it looks clean enough,  always parking outside."}
{"text":"We have gone to every cicis location in Las Vegas and typically they have great service and great price. This one did not. Before we paid we asked if they had stuffed crust and thing crust and Alfredo... they said yes.  After we paid we found out that they had nothing . They were out of most pizza and sauces and dressings.  They said \"next Tuesday they will have everything back in stock\".  So we asked for our money back. Did not get it.  So we walked out and ate nothing.   7 years of going to cicis... no more."}
{"text":"On their website it said kids under 10 with costume eats free. The cashier said it's one free kid per adult purchase. On the site all it said was kids under 10 wig costume it said nothing about one kid per adult purchase."}
{"text":"I'm used to the Cici's Pizza on the eastcoast. For some reason each CiCi's pizza I've been to outside of the west coast have been kind of ghetto. But ya know what, they haven't changed their price. It's still $5 all you can eat, so don't expect 5-star restaurant atmosphere or food.  Anyways, visiting from out of town we hit up CiCi's pizza cause there was a ton of us, we wanted something cheap and not have to wait.  I didn't care too much for the soup or salad.  I went directly for the stuffed crust pizza, cinnamon rolls, garlic bread, and brownies. I mean...it was my cheat day, so I wasn't going to waste it on soup and salad.  I ordered chicken for our table, then was told promptly after that they were out of chicken wings and was immediately refunded. The place is pretty filthy though.  The employees were really nice and customer service was great.  They were really good at keeping pizza and the dessert items available the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"I come to this cicis once in a blue moon. I felt so bad for the whole staff today ! It was extremely busy , but worst of all, the manager / owner was OUT OF LINE and SO RUDE to his whole staff. I used to work at a Cici pizza so I know it gets busy and extremely stressful , but there is NO EXCEPTION for the way he was speaking to his staff, mind you , they all look very young ( 18-20 ). The restaurant was out of order and very dirty , but that did not bother me as much as the owner and his attitude. It made me so uncomfortable that I left! I would not recommend this location to anyone , and I truly hope these kids are not affected by the way their boss treats them. :("}
{"text":"Its pretty good . I like the bbq pizza . fresh salad. Its actually pretty slow during the day but during dinnertime it could get pretty busy. Its also affordable so thats pretty good too."}
{"text":"Little Caesar's priced \"pizza/pasta/salad buffet\" franchise. The place was clean. The staff were beyond friendly. I don't see how this place has a 3 star rating at the moment, it's perfect to me for what it's set out to do as a business.  Lower your standards, folks."}
{"text":"I would like to give it 2 stars just because of the quality and the funny feeling you get in your tummy after wards.... but the workers here are just so nice. They WANT to create a pizza just for you!!  I guess you can't complain too much for an all you can eat pizza buffet for $5. If you're eating healthy, seek else where because even the salad is limp from all its dressing.   I don't think I finished a single piece entirely, and I hate wasting food, but I just couldn't bear to get it down... I advise you to come here when your wallet is sad, your stomach is empty, and when you feel like no one will give you what you want!"}
{"text":"This location SUCKS. They promote you signing up for emails in the location but then they never participate in any of the specials that get sent out. Mother's Day special emailed out was Moms eat free with purchase of adult or child meal. I was coming in with like 7 people - I am the only Mom - and they tell me they are not participating. And the kid had the nerve to have an attitude about it! I started to speak to a manager about it but decided to just walk out instead. The food is not worth the argument. I could see you being a jerk about participating in the specials if you had gourmet food but its not. Its only palatable enough to get the family fed for cheap. And you were willing to loose 42.00 and all our future business to save 7 bucks? Wise.  Never again."}
{"text":"Informed me when I came in at 9:27 pm they cannot give our party the buffet when I choose this location for the close time of 10pm. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Well I know chain buffet what should you expect. I did not leave hungry however less then satisfied. Apparently they have a fixed selection, always a pepperoni, cheese, ok good. But always a spinach flatbread and an Alfredo and three buffalo chicken pizzas, really?? What happened to sausage or a pizza with any kind of veggies or better a supreme( meat and veggies)"}
{"text":"It was okay yes, for that part of town it looks decent enough  wings under cook... no to spice we ask for extra hot and the was all flats ....ohh boy what else do you expect..."}
{"text":"This place was a mess. It was drity as hell. The customer service sucked , managment sucks. I ordered a pizza too go then when i walked in it looked like it has not been cleaned in days. Floor was black, the salad was getting warm. It was not what i expected at all."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about CiCi's pizza?  Finally gave it a shot and wished that I had not given it a second thought.  It's not even that cheap, if you consider the total after drinks are added.  The quality is just not there of course. Not going to find anything gourmet in their AYCE buffet.  I guess I am one that prefers quality over quantity.  The $18 bucks or so we spent for two was not worth it by any means.  I am not a fan of cheese covered cardboard which is their version of pizza.  Oh well I tried it, now I know what it is all about.  Life will go on without ever consuming their cardboard cuisine again.  Enough said..."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest cicis I have visited. Pizza at noon wasn't very fresh either. But for $5.99, you get what you paid for!"}
{"text":"The owner of Cici's is not a good person, he only cares about money not doing the right thing! whatever you do if you use Cici's for a \"fundraiser\" don't pay upfront because they lie when they say you can get your money back, yeah if the owner would return phone calls or be available... He ran to the store when you wanted to buy them but not when you want to return them."}
{"text":"I remembered that the BF mentioned that he went to a CiCi's Pizza two years ago in Las Vegas while he was there for a conference. So, naturally, when I tagged along with him for the annual conference last year, I already knew that I wanted to hit up CiCi's for one of our lunches there.   We visited this CiCi's in between exhibits because it wasn't too far from the Convention Center (at least, from what I can remember ... it didn't take us too long to get there). Though this restaurant location was slightly darker and dirtier than some of the other locations I've been to--the BF said it looked more ghetto than some of the other restaurants we visited in the past--I was just glad to find that the food quality was the same, and the workers were pleasant and accommodating. Plus, since we were going for lunch in the early afternoon on a Wednesday, the eatery wasn't crowded at all, so we enjoyed a peaceful, leisurely lunch. And, since this CiCi's is in a plaza, there's plenty of parking and not hard to find. If I'm ever in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to re-visit this CiCi's (but probably not if I were alone and it were late at night).   There's always one thing I always look for when I go to CiCi's -- that signature, cheesy \"Mac 'n Cheese Pizza\" that's my ultimate favorite. However, there are other things featured on the menu that I enjoy as well. Here are some of the things I would recommend from this cheap pizza buffet:  \"Mac & Cheese\" Pizza: You won't often see this particular pizza sitting out on the buffet line, and come to think of it, all the times I have been to CiCi's, I've had to request it. This creamy, savory pizza comes with the curly noodles (same type featured at the pasta station) baked on top to make the ultimately cheesy pizza. Now, mac & cheese pizza might sound gross to some people--like a wet and watery mess--but the noodles are baked firmly atop the pizza but the cheese remains melted and gooey. This has to be my go-to pizza from CiCi's ... I always make sure to order it (at least half a pizza), as I can easily eat two slices by myself!  Pasta Salad: The salad offerings are at the beginning of the buffet, where you'll see lettuce, some toppings (olives, bacon bits, etc.) and an assortment of dressings. I got some of the lettuce and drenched it with blue cheese dressing (my favorite dressing), but I also got a good amount of the pasta salad. I like this pasta salad because there wasn't too many other ingredients mixed in with the pasta. It was light and flavorful; definitely recommend trying it.   Traditional Pepperoni Pizza: The basic pepperoni and cheese pizzas were my favorites when I was a kid, and sometimes, I still get that hankering for a plain ol' pepperoni pizza. Fortunately for me, the CiCi's version isn't overloaded with tomato sauce, which is just the way I like it.   \"Chicken Alfredo\" Pizza: Although I don't know the name of this pizza (I'm assuming it was a chicken alfredo-type one), I liked it because it was one of few on the line that featured a cream sauce. There were small chunks of grilled chicken atop the pizza, and in addition to the cheese, the pizza seemed to be topped with the same Alfredo sauce that was featured in the pasta station. A cheese lover at heart, I found this pizza to be gooey and delicious. The sauce blended with the cheese nicely, and the crust wasn't super thin -- it was thin, but not really crispy and sported just enough dough for my liking.   Brownies: CiCi's has a small dessert section at the end of the pizza line. This little section provides several options for those who want to end their savory pizza meal on a sweet note. There's cinnamon bites, a dessert pizza and a slab of cut-up brownies. I always go for the brownies (yes, more than one) to finish off my CiCi's visit. Although they're a bit flatter than most brownies I've encountered, the CiCi's brownies are great because they taste like dark chocolate. Served warm and topped with powdered sugar, the brownies feature a dark chocolate flavor and are moist and dense. When you first bite into the brownie, it may seem a little cakey because of the crisp top, but once you reach the center, you'll experience that moist, chewy fudginess that makes every brownie stellar.  Dessert Pizza: I'm not sure what's in this dessert pizza exactly, but it has a subtly sweet taste that's refreshing after all the savory, garlicky flavors that I have during my meal! While I usually go for the brownie first when getting dessert, I'm always sure to get at least one piece of the dessert pizza. And, best of all, the slices are really small and thin, so you don't need to feel bad about taking more than one!   Garlic Knots: The garlic knots can be found by the pasta section and they're super garlicky and flavorful! These little round balls of dough can fill you up, though, so try to only start with 1-2 and then come back for more later!"}
{"text":"I called and ordered two large pizza, bbq pork and sausage pepperoni and they were ready in a timely manner. Both pizzas were bomb, I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, the fresh pizza is actually a surprising level of deliciousness! A lot of it feels too greasy, especially if it's been sitting out for a while but some things are just too greasy and fattening period. I really did like the mac n cheese and pepperoni pizza, wasn't a huge fan of anything else, especially the spinach and cheese. This Cici's is not the best possible one it could be."}
{"text":"Why bother....you get what you get.  Cutlery didn't look clean.  Staff is very young.  Salad bar \"iffy\".  I'd rather pay more and get higher quality."}
{"text":"My kids love this place and I do because it's cheap and can feed our family of 5.  I'm not expecting gourmet pizza, but for $6, it's good enough.  I like the option of being able to create whatever pizza I like and if there isn't something on the buffet line it will be out shortly.  I do wish their salad bar had a little more options and their cucumbers look sad half of the time.  Overall, I like their zesty pepperoni pizza and cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"The food is good for the price but you'd thing the pizza would be better since it is pretty much all they make. I always order a combo and it's the best thing in my opinion. Service is a bit odd. They rudely come to your table and clear it while you're eating."}
{"text":"Super nice people!! As for the food, it's disgusting. In my opinion, you should only eat here if you have low standards and or are living paycheck to paycheck."}
{"text":"If you're looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.    They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.  The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.  The place really isn't meant for \"Pizza Snobs\" to enjoy a quality pie.  It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, \"Macaroni and Cheese Pizza\" as one of the types).  There were teens and families with small children everywhere.  I was the only person not there with someone under 18."}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way right now. This place isn't Angelo's Pizza or some place that's going to serve up some gourmet pie with unique cheeses and meats. If you're expecting a unprecedented culinary experience, don't go here.  However, if you're looking to spend a little and to get a lot to eat in a fun atmosphere, this is the place to go.  The manager here is exceptional. He asked us what type of pizzas we wanted him to make multiple times, and he even brought a few pieces out to the table for us. The guy's personality was infectious and jolly and he really made our eating experience a lot of fun.  There are some really great pizzas here, in my opinion. The thin crust pizza is good, and so is the BBQ chicken pizza. I always have several helpings of the various types of cheesesticks too. The dessert pizzas are quite good as well. Also, it's good to get a few vegetables in the mix, so be sure to check out their green salad.  Sure, there's kids everywhere and the place may not be immaculate, but it's nothing that a personal-sized bottle of hand sanitizer won't fix.  I always eat way too much when I come here, so I don't come here very much. When I do, though, I've never left disappointed. Lower your expectations, open your mind, be ready to have some fun, and you won't either!"}
{"text":"Me and my 6 year old son had a dinner date here tonight.  I can't think of much good to say about my experience at the establishment  Good: no wait to get in. Cashier was friendly.   Bad:The pizza was terrible. Cold, underdone, barely any toppings. Same with the desserts. The \"brownies\" were mush. Definitely raw. The employees making them food right behind the open bar, we're listening to vulgar music.  I thought this was supposed to be a family friendly restaurant??  At one point we had left the table for about 2 minutes and came back to someone else's dirty dishes on our table.  I won't be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I'm never coming back to this particular Cici's pizza location. The salad and pizza are completely dry. They look and not to mention tasted, like they've been out for decades. Even the babies didn't like it. The customer service was great. They were very friendly but they really just need to work on the freshness of the pizza, salad and pasta. Thanks for the food but no thanks. You get what you pay for I guess. Good luck."}
{"text":"Back at it again. This cicis location is much tastier than any other location I've been to. They seem to keep up with the freshness of their food so that's good. Customer service is friendly which is always a plus. Thanks for the pizza. It was good ."}
{"text":"Every staff I have encountered has been super nice and friendly. Good variety of toppings for the salad bar, good breadsticks and cheese sticks good pasta like marinara and Alfredo. But, my favorite part has to be the chicken noodle soup idk what is in it besides the usual but it is so dam tasty that I make that 30 minute drive just for it. Good desert bar super simple. You can even make/create your own pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok for the price. The salad bar was under stocked, the soup was very good as was the desert cinnamon rolls. Went on a Friday night, screaming, crying, running loose kids everywhere, this is where a stiff drink or four would have come into play, but they don't serve those here. Don't go in there expecting to find parents in control of their kids!"}
{"text":"It's def not a good sign when the windows of your business are filthy. NOW WHERE DO I START... pizza selection - none. Okay... how about some salad - none. Hmmmm how about some marinara noodles - none. No bowls out, no forks. Whaaaa? They must have had some issues with scheduling because this establishment should be used to volume esp being down the street from a major theme park. No excuses. Highly disappointed visit. My pictures should speak for themselves."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but I've noticed that it has been getting slack with its quality and selection of pizzas. All I wanted is a veggie flatbread pizza which they usually have on deck. Not today. To get what you want you must custom order. Today apparently everyone had a order in a they actually ran out of numbers. I guess you get what you pay for so I shouldn't have too high expectations."}
{"text":"Saw this place as was looking for something different. Nor sure what caught my eye.  Anyways, had lunch here and it was a pretty decent place considering its a pizza buffet, which typically isn't all that glamorous. Impressed by desserts, especially brownie and the desert pizza with white sauce topping. Everything else is pretty standard.   The people working behind the counter were very upbeat and happy when I dealt with them.   Overall not bad place, especially for the price. Probably won't try to repeat, but if in area again might."}
{"text":"Oh man... went there for lunch today and that was just a bad idea. The guy behind the counter was a jackhat, must have been having a bad day and was constipated or something, he was just very unfriendly and was yelling at me because I didn't put the spatula thing down correctly (I'm sorry, did not know there was a certain way but will remember next time). I've been to other Cici's in different states and the pizza and everything tasted great but here... give me an old worn out flip flop, stick some sauce and cheese on it and call it a pizza. The pizza was awful with no flavor, just texture smothered in grease.   When I went into the bathroom to go wash my hands, there was a worker in there blowing her nose and I guess she sprayed her nose goop all over the sink because she used the same tissue and wiped the sink with it and walked out.... I just stopped and stared, please tell me she was leaving for the day and she is not going back to make pizza. Then I walked out and nearly face planted the floor because the floor outside the bathroom was covered in grease.  All in all, the service sucked, the cheese covered flip flop they call pizza was garbage and the worker blowing nose jam may or may not be making the flip flops... oh yeah, my husband is still in the bathroom with the squirts.. my guess, nose jam"}
{"text":"First time Ci Ci's virgin. Took the kids here to get their eat on. Started off with the salad which was average.  I liked the fact that they had soup available for you as well.  It was chicken noodle the day I visited.  Cheeseburger pizza was pretty good, different, and did taste like i was eating a cheeseburger.  Taco pizza was good, tastes like an average taco.  There is also desert pizza to satisfy your sweet tooth.  All you can eat makes it a good value as well.  It was moderately busy with kids and adults balancing out the crowd.  The place was relatively clean.  I would come back here again, not so much that the pizza was outstanding, but it was good eating and family friendly."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I actually like this place. This was my first time eating at Cici's. My fella and friend's forced me to dine here and boy did I drag my heels!  The price is right and the pizza is actually pretty ok. It's not gourmet. It's not even close to being the best pizza I've ever had, but it definitely wasn't the worst and I have to reluctantly admit it was actually pretty good.   They have a lot of variety and they will customize a pizza to whatever you are you craving. How can you beat that? I'm usually not a big fan of dining anywhere where I will encounter lots of kids, but luckily we came early enough that this wasn't a major issue. My favorite pizza was probably the buffalo chicken. It had a good spice level and was pretty darn tasty. I'm sure this would be an issue on future visits however.  Try as I might to not like this place, it just couldn't be done. You can't beat the price ($4.99 or $3.99 for the weekday lunch) and I'll try to hit them up for lunch next time to save an extra buck, hehe.  I had a request from my fella that I make sure to mention that he had an entire pizza all to himself (not to mention two extra slices of buffalo and two of dessert pizza). He was impressed by this feat (not sure why) and felt the need to let everyone know."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! The staff really works hard and maintains a great environment despite being short staff on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was thinking going to this place.  The red flag should've been the 300 lb man waddling out of the restaurant still shoving his face with pizza.     It is the Walmart of pizza places. If cold, cheap, cracker-like pizza is worth being surrounded by trash then  this place is right up your alley, literally.    Never again."}
