{"text":"I havent ordered wings but i have ordered from them twice, friday night delivery took longer than my previous delivery which was on a weekday afternoon, they slightly messed up my order (a chicken sandwich and they forgot the toppings but i also ordered a salad so whatevs) but i disagree with the other reviews, my food was good each time, (a cheese burger the 1st go 'round)  i like them enough for when i dont feel like cooking or leaving the house to get food and they dont have a ridiculous minimum delivery price."}
{"text":"Ordered at 5:56 got my food at 7:54. I called at 7:25 to make sure they got my order because I ordered online. The guy told the driver should be knocking on the door. The sauce is good but wings are Luke warm.  Not happy at all"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold. Wing sauce was spilled all over bag."}
{"text":"Just go to wingstop, this place is a joke and needs to be shutdown by corporate. Seriously do you guys require that your employees be incompetent?"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who like wings! Good food good service. It's in a great location with convenient parking."}
{"text":"Wish i coul have given zero stars. Horrible service and very rude staff. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Please reconsider before ordering from this Wing Zone location. I had a very simple order for delivery and they delivered an incorrect sandwich. They offered to redeliver a correct sandwich when I called for a refund, then delivered another incorrect sandwich. At this point I simply gave up on seeking the correct order. Incompetent, disorganized staff. If you are considering a place for wings in the area, try the Wild Wing Cafe off Mallard Creek Church road--they don't deliver, unfortunately. Still, I wouldn't risk a disappointing delivery experience with these folks."}
{"text":"Listen lmao y'all better off getting some gas station wings. These jawns take minimum 1hr-1hr & 1/2 to prep, they got like one cook back there bustin ass. Expensive and slow, Pizza Hut quality (no offense to the Hut)"}
{"text":"I placed this order today (12/15/2017) at 3:40pm...it's now 6:27pm...no food! I made 42 calls to the number shown in my order confirmation and either was ignored, would get a weird sound like a fax, hung up on, spoke with some one twice, 1st time was told driver was 10-12 minutes out (driver never showed up!), 2nd time I got some one online,he hung up on me! This was the first and LAST time I'll EVER order anything from this place...NEVER AGAIN! It's 6:38pm...2 minutes shy of 3 hours since the order was placed and food is finally here...UNBELIEVABLE...NEVER EVER AGAIN...YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a wing zone. The sauce was delicious and overall the they were pretty good. They were fried kinda hard though. Well harder than I like. And I don't know if thats normal or not but overall they were good allowing room for error cause we all make mistakes and it was late.   I wouldn't want to be frying wings at 11 PM which is why I ordered, lol."}
{"text":"Really good wings, delivered quickly, but a little over priced.  Lots of different flavors, if you want to go out for wings, there may be better places, but up there as far as delivery goes. You can find coupons in mail or on the net."}
{"text":"When I opened the boxes, it looked like there was not enough sauce on chicken pieces but when I actually ate it, it was flavorful!!   I would have appreciated it they had stickers/notes on the box for different flavors. We ordered 3 different sauces but did not know which one was what. It's really necessary since most of their orders are take aways."}
{"text":"We placed a takeout order and the driver went to the wrong address. We had to call two separate times, we're put on hold for over 10 mins and my child fell asleep waiting for the food. It shouldn't take 2 hours for food to be delivered. The manager Rico said all he could give us was a 20% discount. This was my fist time ordering and just might be my last. Bad service!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service...took almost two hours to deliver on two separate occasions. The food was cold both times. On the second occasion a BBQ cup had popped all over the food containers"}
{"text":"The guy taking our order was nice and got my order right.  It didn't take to long for the order to be complete and the price wasn't too bad.  However the wings were not anything to brag about, they have tons of flavors but they don't really stand out.  The frys were good.  I don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"I will never order from here again. Not only did i place my order at 10:00 and expect it at 11:00 somehow 30 min was added to my order the delivery guy didn't even know if I paid already for my order. I would've much rather ordered pizza, paid less for delivery and got it no more than 45 min. later after paying for it. Literally could've drove to my nearest Harris teeter got some groceries came back cooked it all before having my food delivered from a restaurant that is less than 10 mins from my home."}
{"text":"While staying at the Homewood Suites in Charlotte, I was told that we could order from Wing Zone and charge it directly to the room, which was a nice little feature.  We got delivery to the room and it was pretty quick.    I had ordered the boneless wings which were tossed in a mild hot sauce.  They were kind of dry and could have used extra sauce on the side (or really they needed to not be cooked and then set under a heat lamp to dry out).  We had also gotten an order of cheese fries to share.  The fries were thick steak-cut wedges that they had covered in shredded mixed cheese that (I'm assuming) they thought would have melted by the time it got delivered, but the fries weren't hot enough so it just had shredded cheese on top.    It wasn't bad, but I think this might be the kind of place that you have to sit there and eat so it all comes out super hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm tired of great meal places with mediocre customer service.  If they say 20 minutes prep time, expect 40-50 minutes of a wait.   The food is great when they get the order right.  It takes forever however, to get the food.   Happens every time after 5pm.  Also had a messed up order a few weeks back and called to let them know.  Was promised a call by the manager the next morning.  Their food service is faster than the manager.  Still waiting on that phone call.  Only advantage these guys have is the food is just better than the competitors.   Doesn't make it any less painful when waiting for the order to be made."}
{"text":"this is  the worst place to order delivery , i ordered a chicken sandwich end a Caesar salad. the sandwich came with out any toppings, and they only put 2 chicken tenders  on top of the sandwich with no setting or the ranch that i requested end the salad they only put 4-5 pieces of tenders on top.  The worst thing is i used to be a SERVER for  5 years . That was one of the worst food i ever tasted.  truthfully regretted ever tipping the driver $5 RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"Got a delivery for some Cool Ranch wings and a 1/4 pound burger with cheese and bacon for an extra $1 each.  Food was all luke warm.  Burger did not taste fresh.  I paid extra for 1 piece of bacon broken in half to represent 2 pieces.  Burger was below average at best.  Wings were ok with the dry rub flavor.  But didnt seem like the bigger pieces were not cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for the food to be delivered. Called twice, and the first time they said the driver hit traffic, and the second time they said that the driver was out and there was nothing they could do. Food came two hours after we ordered it and was cold. They could have at least offered something for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Took 2 hours to get my order. I live 5 minutes away. The food was cold and terribly seasoned. Had to call the store twice to check on my order and whoever it was told me \"the delivery guy is right there\" and the  it took another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place had a menu in the hotel where I was staying.  The hotel is next to the restaurant.  The menu heavily focused on delivery to the hotel and the ability to charge it to your room account.  I called and they seemed not to know anything about it.  Spoke with four people and ended up with a manger.  He told me cash only or 20% surcharge for delivery.  This additional charge should have been mentioned on the menu.  Clearly a scam by the restaurant.  I spoke with the hotel and they were not aware of a surcharge.  I'm giving this place a single star for unethical business practices.  They deserve zero stars."}
{"text":"Stay away!!! We placed an order for delivery and was told it would be a 45 minute wait time... An hour and a half later our food arrived and everything was cold!! We had asked for bleu cheese there was none, the macaroni and cheese bites were ok at best, the mozzarella sticks were nothing special and the wings were not good at all. Take your money ANYWHERE else!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Called for delivery at 930 pm and here it is 1056 pm and food was delivered 10 min ago but it was the wrong order. Now I am waiting for the right order from a new person  but they are bringing the other driver back as well to bring this cold food to the right person! This will be my last time ordering from this place!"}
{"text":"I should have listened to the reviews on here. Given it was my first time ordering from here, I thought I would give them a try. Ordered online on a Sunday evening at 5:20pm and didn't receive my food until 6:35pm. After 40 minutes I called because I noticed my card hadn't been charged yet. The guy who answered the phone was also the guy who delivered my food. When I asked why it took so long, he said all the drivers were out on deliveries. Seems to me his one guy runs the business, closes down to deliver. Upon receiving my food, which was twenty original wings, they were very small, over cooked  and also cold. The only temperature to them was the heat from the flavor. Save your money and don't waste your time on this place. Trust the reviews, unlike me. Told the guy it wasn't a great first impression and he got a zero $ tip. Won't be ordering from this location ever again."}
{"text":"Worst place to order for delivery takes an average of 45mins to an hour & never have gotten my order correct stay away from this place"}
{"text":"I ordered through Yelp and when I called to see what the wait was they said 45 minutes.  It was 8 PM on a Wednesday, so I canceled the order because we needed it sooner.  When I called the lady told me to call another store, but that was the number online.  The call got dropped and I called back.  She asked me to call someone else and after I asked for the number she said \"nevermind I will take care of it\" and hung up.   The charges were still charged to my card and after 7 days they were not refunded to my card.  When I called back the phone rang for over two minutes.  I called again and the same thing.  I called again and talked to a polite young man who got me what I needed, but before he could answer if I was being refunded the call of course- dropped.  I am going to have to go into the store personally.  Not impressed. Never had the food and zero intention."}
{"text":"Ordered into my room at the Homewood.  Confusion on the phone over what they did or didn't have available.  I had already had a light meal at the hotel, so I only wanted to order appetizers and a dessert.  It was on the company, so I ordered cheese sticks, mushrooms and banana cheesecake bites  Everything seems to be overly breaded and overseasoned and I'm guessing a frozen, bought in product.  The banana cheesecake things were awful and both the mushrooms and cheese sticks were so heavily breaded that I made efforts to remove as much as possible.  Throw in a 20oz coke and delivery charge, I spent more than $20 for food I mostly tossed because of poor quality.  Next time I'll just get in the car and head out"}
{"text":"They blew it again! Ordered boneless wings and they were so overcooked as to be inedible. Called the store and was told the most they would do is give a 205 discount on the next order. It'll be a long time before I order again!"}
{"text":"So I had never heard of this place until I saw their menu on the bureau in the hotel I was staying in for the weekend. I glanced over it and it was pretty extensive with all kinds of things represented. Being a wing fanatic I knew I wanted wings.  After the Janet concert I attended, I made it back to the hotel after a 2 hour wait to leave the parking lot. This was the perfect time to put this restaurant to good use. So I called them up to place a delivery order.   The employee that answered the phone informed me that the menu was old and that they had an updated version. She gave me the different specials they had. I ended up choosing the Cool Ranch wing basket with wedge fries, 5 fried shrimp, and an order of celery with dressing. The whole order with all the fees included came up to $20 and some change. That was fine. She told me it would be about 45 minutes. The food came and I was quite impressed!!!!   The wings were fried just the way I like them, nice and hard. The flavoring on them was pretty good too. The fries were great as well. They had a nice flavor to them. I order spicy shrimp but the seasoning didn't come on them. It was in a cup and you pour it on yourself. Odd but ok!!! I enjoyed that meal and it really hit the spot!!!! I can see myself dining here over and over again!!!!"}
{"text":"I've given this place so many chances with their food because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.. They just kept getting it wrong. The best thing on the menu would probably be the cheese fries, but not because they're particularly good, the rest of the food is just that bad. Any time I've ordered delivery the food has been cold, the driver ignored all instructions, and it's taken about an hour and a half. I'm not sure if they're messing up or if they just don't care. Either way avoid this place. There are LOTS of great wing places in the area, Wing Zone is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"Absolutely Horrible all the way around. I love wing zone but this location needs new management and staff immediately!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I've ordered here once before (when I was drunk so I cannot even speak on that). Me and the boyfriend ordered chicken tenders with some honey mustard or whatever flavor with fries, I got celery and dip, he got coleslaw, and we both got the bread. We ordered this to go and I let the boyfriend get the food. Big mistake because he didn't check the food. Granted, it should've been right but I digress.   The tenders had NO seasoning on them. There was nothing to dip my celery in. And the bread is super over seasoned.   Prices were decent. Very comparable to have an entree and 2 sides.  We called back when we got home and the manager did give us half off for the next time."}
{"text":"Ok, here we go.. this place failed miserably. The atmosphere here is bland at best! Placed my order, and had to wait a long time. Wings are overcooked and veggie strips are more like veggie slabs! Highlight of the meal was the potato salad,  it was actually good! The staff here is so self absorbed and cater to their friends when they arrive. Hmmm. No worries, I'll pass go when it comes to the wing stop! #PITIFUL!!"}
