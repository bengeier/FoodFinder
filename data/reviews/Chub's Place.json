{"text":"Awful, rude service. They act like they don't want you there. Expensive, low quality food. I would give them zero stars if that was an option. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The staff was unfriendly from the get go. I got an omelet, which was essentially just greasy sausage and ham and eggs, no cheese. My friends got a cheeseburger and a cup of soup. When we got our bill, the total was $27.00. I said there was no way that was accurate, and she told me that was not expensive for three people. One of us only got a cup of soup! They charged four dollars for me to get two meats in my omelet, which is ridiculous. To top it off, the establishment is dirty too. I'm never going there again!"}
{"text":"Chubb's is an excellent place to go for breakfast. If you have never had a grilled Oram's Cinnamon Roll, you need to come here. The eggs, bacon, and home fries are delicious and plentiful. Cash only."}
{"text":"Still looking for that perfect diner in the greater Pittsburgh area. This wasn't it. Bacon sandwich was good, but the fries were greasy, unsalted, and tasted kind of metallic. Expensive for the quality. I love a good greasy-spoon, but this one did not seem to try very hard. One good thing was the service: friendly and quick."}
{"text":"When it comes to a Greasy Spoon, I'm your expert. This cute little diner sure fits the bill. It probably seats about 25 people, but they also have counter seating. There's apparently always the same one lady doing the cooking, and man can she grill up some good grub. 
We went for breakfast while visiting family and paid very little for a satisfying breakfast of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, bread (homemade from a nearby bakery) and bacon. Nothing fancy, just your standard breakfast or sandwich fare. I've heard that if you use the restroom there you will leave without eating, so go before you arrive. 
Part of the appeal is the fact that the same people come here every week. Another part of the appeal is guessing who in the diner drove the Jaguar that is parked in their gravel parking lot. It's an interesting establishment!"}
{"text":"Once again I'm forced to ask, \"How have I never heard of this place before?\"  I saw a DoubleTake Deal for this place called Chub's and noticed that it wasn't too far from work and they served breakfast.  Any further information was difficult to find.  A few reviews on Urbanspoon and only one Yelp review?  Sigh.  I optimistically gave it a try.

And I'm glad I did!  I've probably driven by it before but never noticed it or thought it was part of the golf course it sits next to because it is an odd location.  But there's a huge parking lot you can turn into if you almost fly right by it like I did.  

It was a weekday morning and we were the first customers of the day at 7:30am.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  We had some questions about menu items but my friend and I both went with Chub's Breakfast - two eggs, home fries, toast and meat.  I of course selected the bacon, my friend the ham.  The cost was under $7 for each.  It wasn't anything all that extraordinary for a breakfast, but the home fries were buttery and so delicious.  We both received hefty portions of our meat selections.  My coffee cup was never empty.

There is a plethora of breakfast places around so unless you have a unique menu item, the draw has to be the cost and your service.  I was impressed with both at Chub's and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just like home! These lady's have been killing the breakfast game for years.  The wait is always well worth it and the LPO is outstanding.  Always have to stop when I'm back in the Burgh."}
{"text":"This restaurant's claim to fame (and I m not kidding) is the L-PO.  A dish of fried eggs,potatoes,onions and sausage(a dish I often make at home). But they will proudly tell you that its name is a derivation of the canine staple, Alpo.  And the dish is totally appropriate for this establishment.  If you like the run down diner look, this is the place for you.  If you want a poor replica of the Primanti sandwich, this too, is the place to go.  If you want to see the most corroded restroom faucet, ever, try the men s room.  If you want to sit at a dirty table, on a dirty chair, then you ll love this place.  But if you want good food in a clean restaurant, try anywhere else, on earth.  The only good things about this place is the friendly staff and maybe the french fries."}
{"text":"If you're not on a restricted diet and you miss your Momma, this is the place. Bottomless coffee cup with half n' half, thick toast and bacon, eggs cooked exactly how you order. Wonderful family atmosphere with young boys talking loudly about their last game and multiple generations listening to every syllable. The cook performs multiple duties while calmly cooking for all on a large grill. The home fries a reminder that this is close to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stick it to IHOP or Denny's next time you're in McCandless and get your breakfast here! Chub's is one of those quintessential yinzer diners that you just have to visit if you're sick of waiting in long lines at nearby Kelly O's or the various Pamela's Diners scattered all throughout Pittsburgh. 

For a change in pace from your overpriced chain breakfasts, you can expect a meal made with love and lots of butter thrown on the flattop. It's a tiny, homey place with a handful of stools at the bar and maybe 10 tables in the whole train-car shaped restaurant, but if you dig the Yinzer aesthetic (cash-only, Post Gazette clippings about Stillers/Buccos highlights hanging on the walls, hometown fundraising at the cash register and snarky, funny metal signs hung above the stovetops), you've gotta stop. 

Yes, it's a little greasy... it's a down-home diner. Questionable cleanliness is a reason I had to knock my formerly 4-star rating to a 3-star. I honestly don't think it's any different than what's happening in the closed off kitchens at Denny's or IHOP though, to be quite frank. 

Quirks aside, I'm so thankful to have a hometown diner like this within walking distance of my apartment. I've never been disappointed with their generous portions, and the service is provided by women who you can just tell have been waitresses and/or cooks most of their adult lives. Plus, when it's in season, you can play mini golf all on the same facility. Win-win. 

Chub's is a classic greasy spoon and it's wonderful."}
{"text":"The water sometimes tastes funny. The fries are natural fresh cut fries. They are delicious. The chicken philly is good. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Great Pittsburgh Style Sandwiches and the L-PO is a must try, unfortunately prices over the years have increased, and cleanliness is subpar. If you're in the North Park area looking for a quick breakfast or early lunch, Chub's Place is the spot for you."}
{"text":"A simple food joint to stop and get a bite. It could be a lot of things, but the best is it privately owned and diner style. Keep supporting it! For those that have nothing good to say, stick with your chain restaurants if you can't identify history and supporting small business."}
