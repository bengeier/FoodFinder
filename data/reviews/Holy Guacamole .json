{"text":"I was excited about a potentially new taco spot, but HG was just ok in my opinion. The food was a bit bland, the salsa watery, and the chips slightly stale. I was happy about the margarita happy hour special, but that might be the only thing that draws me back..."}
{"text":"Come for beer and chips and hanging out, not for the tacos. Group of friends and I tried the place last night and despite a couple hiccups with our server things were going well through drinks and appetizers. Solid serving of reyna's corn chips with the red and green salsa. The red salsa was very lacking in spice as it had no chilis or vinegar and was sweet due to use of cucumber; we aggressively added the table chili sauce to it though and it became quite nice. Green salsa was very nice on its own. Unfortunately that's where enjoyment stopped.  It was taco Tuesday so getting a collection of tacos for the table was economical and gave us room for trying many kinds. Selections included gaucho, quesadilla, islander, Baja, backyard.   Unfortunately, everything was underseasoned at best and bland at worst. Despite the different makeups of the tacos, all the vegetable accompaniments (though fresh) just tasted like they had been cooked alone, no flavors coming from the other ingredients in the taco. Same for the meats and sauces. I highly doubt any of the food actually cooks together and it shows because despite good recipes, the lack of cohesion kills the concepts. Regardless of that though seasoning was sparse to totally absent. Sauces were okay when present but nowhere near enough to make up for the blandness of individual ingredients.  I just learned that the chefs are vegan and must do a lot of work to prevent 'animal product contamination' of their vegan products. If they have to cook meats and veggies separately, I think this is why things came out so bland. There is just NO umph or wow factor in anything that we tried. Proper seasoning can be accomplished even if prepped in this way, but it's not happening as far as I can tell.  I highly doubt we will repeat."}
{"text":"Holy smoley what crappy guacamole!  (Slow service!) Guacamole took 30 minutes! The tacos mediocre at best and tortillas were terrible."}
{"text":"Friday night. 7pm. This place is the woooooooorst. No service. Bad tacos. I had to wait 15 min between getting my pitcher and getting cups to actually drink it. Overall, this place is not suited for waiting on a semi packed restaurant. Like I get that you guys are used to being empty, but COME OOOOOON. Please hire more staff to actually serve tables. My waiter didn't even take my order, the poor hostess had to pick up after her. Also, someone just sprayed bleach all over to kill us all with fumes."}
{"text":"I love this newest addition to Shadyside! The tacos were SO good - I tried 4 different flavors and none of them disappointed! Anything with the Alabama white sauce is worth ordering. I also did a \"create your own\" margarita with blackberry fruit juice and agave nectar - yes, please! We also had guacamole with grilled pineapple that was the best I've ever had! My only complaint was the guacamole specifically was pretty expensive, but would not stop me from ordering again. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the beach house nachos and a beer. The nachos were delicious. Cool atmosphere. Outdoor seating was nice.  It took 10 mins to have a waiter take our order then once found came it took 10 mins to get plate and napkins.  So, food is good but I think there needs to be some work on the process."}
{"text":"Got to attend the yelp elite event here with a friend! The vegetarian tacos were amazing. They were different than your run of the mill black bean veggie taco choices. One had smoked tofu and the other had Brussels sprouts on it which was surprisingly really good.  Both were so flavorful but didn't just rely on sauce to give all of the flavor. Our waiter/ bartender was really great. Very personable and was able to give good recommendations. Only downfall in my personal opinion was the margaritas were all really really sweet. That wouldn't stop me from coming back though!"}
{"text":"Tacos are really good... service is excellent, staff really accommodating. Took our 1 year old and everyone was very welcoming. Really excited about this place since it's a neighborhood joint. Margaritas can use a bit of work....but I think they'll get there.. great to have something different will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This used to be a pizza bar across from The Harris Grill.  I had 3 tacos they were good. The Cowboy. Islander and Veghead.  I tried the guacamole with homemade chips. You can add your own ingredients like Sriracha, tomatoes,  pineapple,  bacon... etc. I thought it was good but the serving was small for the price. I paid almost 10 bucks for the guacamole and chips after add ons. Everything else seemed to be good and inexpensive.  This is a cool hang out spot/bar on Ellsworth. I'd like to go back if I'm in that area."}
{"text":"We had such a great time here at a recent Yelp Elite event. The tacos and Guacamole are great. I love that you can add toppings to the Guacamole for a little customization. The margarita flavors are fun and creative and the serving size is large. They don't hold back on the tequila either! The happy hour deals here are great and hey have an awesome kids menu too!"}
{"text":"This place is 100% not worth a visit. The tacos were subpar and overly salty. The worst part, however, was the atrocious service. It took 20 minutes for our table of 5 to receive drinks, we had vegetarians at our table who got meat in their tacos, and we were overcharged at the end of the meal. The only reason is gets two stars is because their margaritas were pretty good. It's best to go with the menu options instead of create your own, but they were strong and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Holy Guacamole based on the positive reviews, but it sorely disappointed. The beer list underwhelmed, while the lime margarita tasted like well tequila with a hint of lime. If you're trying to get smashed, you're in luck, but if you want a good margarita this was not it. We ordered chips and salsa, which were good, but could also be purchased off the shelf at Reynas. The meat based tacos weren't bad, but they weren't good when compared to other places like Reynas or Condado. The tofu tacos were a big disappointment. They were burnt and flavorless. Service was also very slow, but we're not sure if this is because they're new or not."}
{"text":"This was our choice for a taco Tuesday night out Holy Guacamole lives up to the day... With $ 2.50 tacos They have a few outside tables in front plus their inside We chose outside hoping they would know we were out there  Ryan was there in a flash happy to tell us about their tacos I had a lime soda drink it was very refreshing  We of course ordered the guacamole with chips from Reynas (as per the menu) You can get it three ways one is a fruity option with pomegranate  We had regular oh my gosh it was really good not spicy just the right amount of creamy chunky  Menu offers meat chicken and tofu in any of their tacos  The tacos are soft  I had a back yard and an islander they were delish! The tofu was just right  Son had beef with cheese lettuce and tomatoes he was very happy  It's nice place to sit relax and enjoy  Did not see dessert items but were were full so it's ok. We will return"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks. Happy hour specials are terrific. Highly recommend. Will return many times."}
{"text":"I came in for a Yelp Elite event. The atmosphere reminds me of an American bar/pub but they sell Mex-tex food. There are TV screens with the Pirates game on.  I ordered the chips and oh grapple salsa. It was flavorful. There was more salsa than chips which is rare.   I ordered two margaritas. They were both pretty strong and delicious. you gave your choice of fruit juice and then syrup flavor. I got a peach basil one and a blueberry mint one. The price of $7 for house tequila I'd standard I think. They have a happy hour from Tuesday to Saturday for $5 margaritas and $2 tacos from 4:30 to 6:30.   I ordered the po boy and hop head taco. The po boy came with chicken, lettuce, tomato, and garlic pickled, and Creole remoulade. It was tasty. The chicken was a dominant flavor. The hop head had smoked tofu, fried Brussel sprouts, IPA mustard sauce, and sriracha. The Brussel was the dominant flavor. The tofu took on the Smokey flavor, which was great because I don't like the taste of tofu. Don't let the mustard sauce fool you, it's hardly noticeable...but in a good way.   I would definitely come back. The service was great and it was a nice cozy feeling."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here! Sometimes it takes a while for new restaurants to work out their kinks, but that doesn't seem to be the case at Holy Guacamole. They fit in as if they have always been there. They have a small menu with a fun layout. Basically three parts; tacos, nachos and guacamole. They have many meat options for tacos (including pork which I rarely see in most taco places), and two vegetarian options. However, you can sub any taco meat for the smoked tofu. That is incredibly exciting! Both the nachos and guacamole sections include a standard and a \"create your own\". I wanted to try the guacamole without anything added so I could get a good representation of the the standard. A bit plain of course, but quite good. We devoured the whole bowl.  I ordered the backyard taco (sub tofu) and the veg head taco. I found the backyard taco to be tasty and sweet but it was quite runny. I had to throw napkins in my tray so that it would not soak my other taco. The veg head one was amazing! Nothing goes better than black beans, sweet potatoes and avocado. A very slight bit of spice and the smoked tofu added another element to the flavor.   I do have two small suggestions, however. The first being that I really wanted the option of sour cream with my tacos. It doesn't have to come standard but it would greatly improve the experience. The second is that I would love an option of plain tofu as opposed to always smoked tofu. I find the smoked tofu sometimes replicates meat too well and I become nauseous.    Another note: the chef came up to say hi and mention taco Tuesday, which I will absolutely come back for. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This was my first YELP elite event and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening!  APPS Chips and guacamole... loved the crunchy and flavorful tortilla chips from Reyna in the strip district. Guacamole was tasty too! Chips and Pineapple Salsa... skip this one, the flavor didn't match the description. Didn't meet my expectations for Salsa.   TACOS #1 Veg Head: the MOST flavorful and delicious taco we had. The corn tortilla was a nice add for this item.  #2 Gaucho: beef was tender but the chimichurri could have had more flavor. Not bad. #3 Baja: disappointing with too much crema sauce and not enough fresh pico. Definitely get this one on the flour tortilla instead of corn!  #4 Quesadilla taco: too much tortilla, not nearly enough fillings. This was the least favorite of what was sampled.  MARGARITAS #1 Strawberry basil: DELICIOUS!!! Loved the fresh basil and salt rim. They balanced the sweetness of the strawberry. #2 Blueberry mint: another fantastic combination of flavors.  #3 Peach ginger: very good and refreshing.  #4 Grapefruit jalapeño: be sure to stir this one and don't just sip from the top! They add a spritz of soda to the top so this one didn't initially taste spicy until I took a swig from the straw! All the spice was in the bottom of the glass. WHEW!!! Bold and beautiful.  Servers was good and everyone was friendly. We did have a mixup on one of our tacos and one of the drinks which were replaced promptly. Good spot to enjoy a taco and margarita!"}
{"text":"So I happened to meet the chef out late one night and was told I should check out Holy Gaucamole. I was a little skeptical being that I don't eat meat but was told I wouldn't be disappointed.  TWO weeks later I went and OMG. BEST. VEGAN. TACOS.IVE. HAD!!!!! ( the veg head is incredible, meat eater or not... get it.) My friend was so impressed with all the meat tacos he had too. We both ended up eating 5 each!    The specials are pretty sweet! .... HAPPY HOUR: T- F 4:30 - 6:30  $2.50 tacos and $5 huge margaritas   Taco Tuesday - tacos all night @  $2.50  Thirsty Thursday - margaritas all night @ $5   Go to this place! Great food and drinks :)"}
{"text":"This is the 5th taco Tuesday that We spent enjoying the delicious tacos and margaritas.The chips and nachos that we shared was out of this world.Ordered the house of hol nachos with shredded chicken, queso and cojita cheese.The mound of guacamole was so fresh and topped the whole plate.Absolutely delicious!!!! The best . Every choice of tacos was flavorful and creative!  One would be a fool not to experience the complexicity of flavors the chef incorporates into every entree.Heather, our waitress, was so knowledgeable about every menu entree and Michael, the owner, made sure everything was to our expectation!.Loved this restaurant A true gem hidden in Shadyside on Ellsworth.Great food, great atmosphere, great experience.Absolutely delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Everything about it is good-the food, the drinks-incredible, the atmosphere, the people, the waitstaff. It's a really fun place to be."}
{"text":"Looooooooved their veg head tacos! You gotta go on taco Tuesday!!!  $2.5 for a taco  the smoked tofu and other veggies were amazing explosion of flavors in my mouth ! Can't wait to go again! Ik happy to see another forward thinking eatery in neighborhood"}
{"text":"My friend and I came for an event. We were sat and our waitress came within a few minutes. She was very friendly and gave a description of the menu, both the drink and main menu. We had many questions about items on the menu and Tory (our waitress) had no difficulties in explaining each item. I'll start with the blueberry and the strawberry margarita's. Both allowed for the taste of fruits and also was not shy with the tequila! Loved them! I will have to say that two margaritas was more then enough, but no regrets.  The selection of tacos was interesting and different for me.  I ordered the Guacho and the Po Boy. The Guacho is probably my favorite as the beef was cooked with flavor and was not dry. The Po boy was also delicious. The chicken was also not dry, full of flavor. However the crema sauce was a bit much, but it was still good.  The salsa verde was a thicker salsa and had a perfect spice to it. The pineapple salsa was my favorite salsa. The pineapples are grilled with, I believe, brown sugar. Then chopped and put together with chunks of the tomato and a kick with jalapeños.  They have a made to order selection for their guacamole. We ended up ordering this as well with our choice of tomatoes and jalapeños. All ingredients played their part wonderfully.The food and service was so good that we ended up ordering another round of tacos!  PS: they have a house hot sauce that is awesome! It has a little more heat then sirracha but has its own taste. You have to give it a second for the kick! Being it's a secret recipe I couldn't get a description of what was in it (sad face).  Returning will definitely be in the near future!"}
{"text":"I came here for a soft opening yelp event a few weeks back and I have mixed feelings. I think the place itself is very cute and has it's own unique style. I was sadly very disappointed with the margaritas. It's very rare that I don't like a margarita but these margaritas were bad enough that I couldn't finish it. It tasted like a glass of sugar and it has carbonation of some kind in it which I didn't like. As for the tacos, I was impressed. I thought the flavor choices were very unique and something you wouldn't see anywhere else. With the numerous taco, mexican, and tex mex restaurants in Pittsburgh you need to have something different that stands out. Holy Guacamole definitely delivers on that."}
{"text":"Came here for a YELP Elite event and it was awesome! APPS Chips and guacamole are really delicious. You can also customize your guac with different fixins. We didn't try this, but it looks delicious and I intend to try it next time I go.  Chips and verde salsa. The salsa was fresh and the chips were good and the perfect amount of saltiness.   Tacos: I had the Gaucho and the Islander on corn tortillas. I love that they had soft corn. They were both delicious but I liked the Islander just a bit more. My friend had the backyard and it smelled heavenly.   Margaritas: As per the suggestion of our fabulous server, Victoria, I got the grapefruit jalapeno margarita. So good. It was light fresh juice and the heat from the jalapeno was pleasantly noticeable without being overpowering.  I also tried the Saint Simon of the strawberry. It was ok but very sweet. Not my favorite.   Service:  Our server was amazing and really helpful. She made great recommendations and was efficient and pleasant.   Overall, I had a great time at Holy Guacamole and I highly recommend that you check it out!"}
{"text":"I attended Yelp's Exclusive Taste event and wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the guacamole and chips.  The guacamole was smooth and flavorful (the poblano, onion, cilantro, lime and house spices weren't overwhelming).   I also ordered two tacos: the Po Boy taco (chicken, shredded lettuce, tomato, homemade garlic pickles and creole remoulade), each ingredient complimented the other.  The pickles added a special crunch!  The Hop Head taco was an unusual combination with deep fried Brussels sprouts, IPA mustard sauce and Sriracha, it came with crispy smoked tofu but I opted to chicken. I love Brussels sprouts but was afraid I wouldn't like them deep fried and on a taco. My to my surprise it was excellent and the mustard Sriracha sauce brought it to another level!    I washed this down with a fresh squeezed lemonade with smoked honey and mint. It was the perfect accompaniment to my tacos! Smoked honey indescribable!  This business is only 2 weeks old! It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"While I wanted to love this place, there were too many things that went wrong during this experience for me to leave with a positive view.  Here are some of the pros/cons of what I experienced as a first time customer.  Hopefully they're still just working out the kinks of being a new restaurant.  The Pros - The vibe - Fun relaxed atmosphere, it's definitely a place you wanna stop and get margs with friends - The location - Right on Ellsworth Ave. in Shadyside, walkable from other restaurants and bars (good people watching from the outdoor seating) -Po Boy Taco - pretty yummy, the garlic pickles and remoulade sauce made this taco! -Management was receptive to my complaint.  The Cons -Chips and Salsa aren't free (they're only $2.81 so not a huge deal) -Hotlicks Red Salsa - tasted like a vegetable puree without much flavor...wouldn't order again -Picnic Taco - Basically like biting into a water balloon filled with salt water! I could not take more than two bites because all I could taste was a salt explosion! Apparently multiple people complained about the saltiness the night I was there, so maybe it was just a bad batch? -Service - The waitress was nice, however she wasn't very attentive.  She did not check back on the table after we got our food.  I sat for 20 minutes waiting to tell her about my taco and she never came back.  I eventually went in and talked to a manager about it, because it was taking so long.  The manager took the price of the taco off of the bill which I appreciated.'  So many taco places in the 'burgh, so little time.  This one is off my list for now!"}
{"text":"I was invited here for a Yelp Elite event, my first! My BF joined me.  I am obsessed with guacamole so I was excited to see their version. We had the basic guacamole. It was fresh & chunky with lots of onion and an interesting seasoning. You can also customize your guac with different add-ins that sounded delicious and fun. We also tried the Verde salsa which was also nice and refreshing.    I was disappointed with the chips, they're made my a local company not in house. I prefer freshly fried restaurant style tortilla chips. These were more like Doritos with out the powdered seasoning.   I tried the Gaucho and the Islander tacos. They were both taco ingredient combinations I had never tried before. They were delicious but I liked the Gaucho just a bit more. My BF also enjoyed his two taco choices.   I found it interesting that none of the tacos had cheese on them... I LOVE cheese! And we weren't asked to select what type of shell, although I think that there are options - our waitress just did not offer.    The Saint Simon of the Strawberry margarita was okay but very sweet almost in an artificial strawberry way. The same with the pomegranate the flavor was overpowering versus refreshing.   Overall, we had a great time at Holy Guacamole. This is a great, fun taco place to check out! These downsides are more than likely beginning kinks that will be worked out."}
{"text":"First time at Holy Guacamole and we're having a great time. The peach ginger margarita is sooooo yummy.  The bartender Tori is ensuring we have a good experience. Tacos are next!  Can't wait."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.. went with family including 3 under5. Walked there on a lovely Friday evening. It was a great experience. Their happy hour is phenomenal!! Tacos 2.50 and really good. $5 margharitas on tap. We had the st. MariA of the lime..was really good and had some kick to it.  All in all I expect to see a lot more of this place. Service was really good too.. menu limited but all good."}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant in Shadyside (took place of bites and brews). I ate at Holy Guacamole the opening eek-where they offered $2.50 tacos and $5 margaritas.   It is owned by the same owners as The Elbow Room. If you have ever been there, you know that the service can sometimes be slower. This was true of Holy Guacamole-slower service. Allows yourself time to drink!!  Our server was very apologetic for the slow service and even comped a drink, as she felt poorly which was greatly appreciated.   I would enjoy seeing some more items on the menu. There are tacos, nachos and guacamole - maybe adding some entries, or combos with the tacos would be helpful. Further, I am hoping to see some happy hour and special pricing throughout the year on the meals."}
{"text":"A nice new taco addition to shadyside. Their decor is great as the big murals of \"in Guac we trust\" are hilarious. We started off with the hotlicks red salsa and chips. The salsa was fresh, but I just was the biggest fan of the mushy consistency. I prefer a bit more chunkier salsa. The tacos are $3.64 each, which isn't a bad price. They have a variety of tacos and you can put any protein in any taco. I had the Quesadilla taco and Picnic taco with crispy tofu. My friend had the Islander and Backyard taco with chicken.   The Quesadilla taco was delicious as the taco shell is a quesadilla. There were grilled peppers and onions, pico de gallo, and Alabama white sauce. I was very impressed with their tofu as tofu can be hit or miss. It was nice and crispy and had almost a meaty texture. The picnic taco was also delicious. It had pickled red onion, coleslaw, avocado ranch, and jalepenos. Again, I was worried the tofu would not taste good with these ingredients, but all the components went well together. We also had lemonade with the tacos, which was very refreshing. The lemonade was fresh and not too sweet.   Overall, we were both very satisfied with our meal. The prices are reasonable and the quality is high. We will definitely be back to holy guacamole!"}
{"text":"When the space was Bites andBrews it was pretty much a bro pizza bar with tons of beers to choose from. I like that the bro part is gone and the beer selection remains the same. The other thing that's the same is the layout which is fine because it flows and is very spacious with a dining room and dining area in bar side. What isn't the same is the decor. What a fantastic rustic, shabby chic upgrade. Woods and vinyls and ceramics and just comfort. Now for the food. We were lucky enough to eat and drink free (and generously tipped out server; more on that in a bit). Even though everything was comped the normal prices are super reasonable especially for Ellsworth Ave. I really liked the tacos...a lot! I had the quesadilla taco and the backyard. I opted for flour tortillas and next time I'll get corn ones. The tortillas come from Reyna's so you know you're off to a good start! The flavor was incredible! Every bite was nothing short of delicious. My boyfriend had a Baja taco and a Gaucho one and he raved about them all night. We also had the guac and wow!!! Holy Guacamole indeed!! Yum yum in the tum tum. I had chips with verde sauce and I'm telling you it's so good I wanted that dreamy green goodness injected into my veins.  We had two margaritas each. Blueberry, peach, lime and grapefruit. Probably the best ones I've had in the city. Strong but not overpowering filled with flavors that gave me a bit of a buzz.  The staff were spot on from our host to server and the amazing chef who stopped by our table for a chat and a hug! Had to hug her the food was divine...or maybe it was the margaritas that made me do it. Seriously can't wait to get back there. Heck, why not tonight? It is Tuesday and they have a great happy hour $2.50 tacos and $5 margaritas...and within walking distance of our house. I've got two words: Holy Guacamole I love this joint!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends. The margarita (Saint Peter of Pomegranate) was good and the tacos were pretty decent, but nothing too special to remember. Our service was terrible. We had such a long wait and when we got our tacos, the orders were completely mixed up. My friends and I ended up not knowing what we actually ate. We were pretty disappointed and do not plan to return."}
